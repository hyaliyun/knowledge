Similar to subtitles in many ways, an interactive transcript is displayed beside the audio or video source. As the user hears the words being spoken, the matching words in the transcript are underlined or highlighted. Interactive transcripts allows users to interact with video in an entirely new way. Users can search the transcript of the video and navigate to an exact point by clicking on any word. Doing so greatly increases the retention of the material. Types There are two broad categories of interactive transcripts. The first, characterized by YouTube, has timings (in minutes and seconds) running down the left side of the transcript. Users click on a block of words to jump to the corresponding section in the video. The second, characterized by Ted Talks, has the transcript in a paragraph form. This allows readers to read more naturally, and jump to a specific points in the video by clicking on a word in the text. Benefits At least 65% of the population are considered to be visual learners, those who absorb and recall information best by reading as opposed to listening. Visual learners benefit significantly from reading transcripts and watching or listening instead of only listening to spoken information. In addition it has been reported that almost 1 in 20 Americans are deaf or hard-of-hearing, as well as millions more around the world. Whether at work or school or home, individuals that have difficulty hearing need new ways to understand and retain the material presented. We read nearly twice as fast as we listen, assuming we want to read every word (an author's dream but not necessarily reality). The average American adult reads prose at 275 to 350 words per minute while most of us speak at around 150-165 wpm. Slide presentations and speeches are often at 100‚Äì120 words per minute. Auctioneers and most true Bostonians speak at 200-250 wpm. Monetization Many sites have various forms of audio/video on their website‚Äîthese same sites rely on search engines for a substantial portion of their visitors. However, search engines currently don't have the capability to know what is in a picture, movie or audio file as they are all text-based. Therefore, these websites may have valuable content that search engines won't be able to know about. The easiest solution to this problem is to for website owners with media to include transcripts on their pages. This text must be placed in the HTML of the page and not loaded dynamically via Javascript. Search engines will then be able to crawl the content and include it in their search results. This will lead to more visitors finding the relevant content they are looking for. If the website owner utilizes advertising on their website, a corollary benefit of having a transcript accompany their media is that advertising platforms, such as Google AdWords, will be able to place relevant advertisements since the content of the media is now known.

Fuchs was charged with war crimes at the Be≈Ç≈ºec Trial in 1963-64, for which he was acquitted. As more evidence came to light, Fuchs was rearrested and tried at the Sobibor Trial in Hagen. He was charged with participation in the Holocaust and on 20 December 1966, found guilty of being an accessory to the mass murder of at least 79,000 Jews. Fuchs was sentenced to four years imprisonment. Life Fuchs was born Erich Fritz Erhard Fuchs in Berlin. He began his career as a motor mechanic. He joined the Nazi Party and the SA in May 1933. Following the outbreak of World War II, in 1940 Fuchs was assigned to the clandestine Action T4 euthanasia program. He served as Dr. Irmfried Eberl's driver while Eberl was Medical Director of the T-4 killing centers at Brandenburg and Bernburg.Klee, Ernst, Dressen, Willi, Riess, Volker. The Good Old Days: The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders, p. 292. . Fuchs was present at many of the gassings of the disabled people. When the Final Solution was set in place at Wannsee, Fuchs was transferred to the newly built Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp in German- occupied Poland for six weeks to install the killing apparatus there.Michael Bryant (2014), Eyewitness to Genocide: The Operation Reinhard Death Camp Trials, 1955-1966. Univ. of Tennessee Press, p. 152. He later testified: After the successful installation of the gassing motor at Belzec, in April 1942 Fuchs was moved to the next secretive construction site at the Sobibor extermination camp. The gas-fueled, two-hundred-horse-power engine was allocated for him already in nearby Lvov by the SS men of Operation Reinhard. He remained at Sobib√≥r for at least four weeks. In Fuchs's own words: While at Sobibor, Fuchs also operated this engine as it fed the gas chambers. Now an SS-Scharf√ºhrer (Sergeant), Fuchs went to Treblinka extermination camp, under the command of his old boss Eberl. He would later testify: Near the end of 1942, Fuchs returned briefly to Bernburg Euthanasia Centre. Then, from December to February 1943 he was stationed at Wiesloch psychiatric institution, where he was involved in \\"euthanasia research\\" and again, present during the gassing operations. In March 1943 Fuchs was removed from Action T4, and his work in mass murder and genocide was done. After the war he worked as a lorry driver, motor mechanic and car salesman. Fuchs was put on trial at the Be≈Ç≈ºec Trial in Munich 1963-64, for which he was acquitted. Fuchs was rearrested and tried at the Sobibor Trial in Hagen. He was charged with participation in the mass murder of approximately 3,600 Jews. On 20 December 1966, Fuchs was found guilty of being an accessory to the mass murder of at least 79,000 Jews and sentenced to four years imprisonment.

He won three All Stars and two All-Ireland Senior Football Championships in his inter-county career with Galway. He also served as manager to the Sligo senior football team from 2008 to 2013. Playing career An effective midfielder, Walsh enjoyed a great playing career at club level with Killannin winning intermediate county titles in 1991 and 2014 against near neighbours moycullen at 45 years of age and at inter-county level with Galway. He was a key member of the latter team during the late 1990s and early 2000s and collected two All-Ireland titles and four Connacht titles during that time. Coaching career=Club Upon retirement from inter-county play, Walsh became involved in coaching. He had been in charge of the Aran Islands junior footballers in 2008. Connacht He was a selector with the Connacht inter- provincial team for a number of seasons. Sligo Walsh volunteered to manage the Sligo senior football team, and was appointed in November 2008. He led Sligo from Division 4 to Division 2 of the National Football League in his first two years in charge winning the Division 4 and 3 titles in the process. He also led Sligo to the Connacht Junior Football Championship and All-Ireland Junior Football Championship in 2010. In 2011, he led Sligo to a second Connacht Junior Football Championship. In 2013, Walsh fell out with Eamonn O'Hara after O'Hara launched a stinging tirade at his former manager on national television and told him to resign. The incident occurred following Sligo's first round elimination from the Connacht Championship at the hands of London. O'Hara gave his inside view of the chaos affecting the county as Pat Spillane peered down his nose over O'Hara's right shoulder, baffled at the news that a county like Sligo could be in an even worse state than Kerry. Then O'Hara called Walsh \\"crazy.\\" Former Armagh footballer Ois√≠n McConville said O'Hara was out of line with his outburst and pointed out that most teams, apart from those to have played in that year's All-Ireland final, go back training in November. Following defeat to Derry in the next game and elimination from the Championship, Walsh resigned as Sligo boss. Galway After the resignation of Alan Mulholland, Walsh was selected as favourite to replace him as manager. Pete Warren was also in the race but withdrew soon afterwards. In September 2014, Walsh was appointed as the Galway Senior Football Manager. On 3 September 2019, Walsh stepped down as manager after five years in charge.

Originally released at 91 minutes; surviving versions are usually cut to 62 minutes. A 74-minute version aired in 1998 on USA cable channel AMC. The DVD version runs just under 72 minutes. The film's working title was Lucky Break and is known as Para alcanzar la Luna in Spain. It is not to be confused with the Fairbanks silent film Reaching for the Moon (1917). Background The film was originally intended to be a musical with songs written by Irving Berlin but problems soon developed. From the start, Berlin found Edmund Goulding, the director, difficult to work with. Also by mid-1930 the studio realized that the public's demand for musicals had disappeared. So Goulding jettisoned many of Berlin's songs from the score. Although just five Berlin songs had been recorded, the film, even in its scaled-down form, proved very expensive to make. By the time the filming was complete, the costs had come to about a million dollars, a huge budget for the times, and one that virtually ruled out the possibility of the film returning a profit. The one song that was retained was \\"When the Folks High Up Do the Mean Low Down\\" introduced by Bing Crosby who had filmed it late at night after completing his work at the Cocoanut Grove. Variety commented on this song specifically, saying: \\"None of the Berlin songs is left other than a chorus of hot numbers apparently named \\"Lower Than Lowdown\\" [sic]. Tune suddenly breaks into the running in the ship's bar when Bing Crosby, of the Whiteman Rhythm Boys, gives it a strong start for just a chorus which, in turn, is ably picked up by Miss Daniels, also for merely a chorus, and then in an exterior shot to the deck where June MacCloy sends the lyric and melody for a gallop of half a chorus. Plot Wall Street wizard, Larry Day, new to the ways of love, is coached by his valet. He follows Vivian Benton on an ocean liner, where cocktails, laced with a \\"love potion\\", work their magic. He then loses his fortune in the market crash and feels he has also lost his girl.

The interior of these cars are adorned with multi-color lights, red bows, garland, and red and green overhead lighting. The hand poles are transformed into inedible candy canes.

Interior of the CTA Holiday Train. The CTA Holiday train began in 1992. That first year, employees posted a sign on the front of the train that read, \\"Seasons Greeting from the CTA.\\" The train delivered food to various charities around the city. Since then, the decorations have become much more elaborate. Now, there is a flatcar for Santa and his reindeer; and the interior is covered with lights, paper, streamers and decorative signs.  Schedule  The Holiday Train visits every Chicago 'L' station on every line throughout its run during November and December. The train operates from about 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on select weekdays and makes all scheduled stops at stations along the line.  Charity run  Over the period of five days a week, the CTA Holiday Train delivers food baskets to local community organizations at various stops. Food baskets contain various foods for a complete meal; these include canned ham, potatoes, mixed vegetables, fruits and a dessert. Reception The song \\"CTA X-mas Train\\", describing the Holiday Train, by the Snow Angels was the winner of the Chicago Tribune's New Holiday Classics Christmas song contest in 2009. It narrowly avoided being shut down by CTA president Frank Kruesi after the budget cuts of 2004. A spokesman said, \\"It didn't seem appropriate to devote resources to this project when 1,250 positions are being eliminated\\". He was, however, overruled by CTA board chair Carole Brown. Today the cost to the CTA to run the train is minimal. Decorations are reused from year to year or donated by CTA employees. As the trains run regular service, most workers are either on their regular schedules or volunteering their time.

Zierke helped to perpetrate the Holocaust. He was charged with being an accessory to the murder of 360,000 Jews at death camps, acquitted twice, in the Belzec and Sobib√≥r trials of 1965 on grounds of acting under duress and set free. Career Zierke was born on 6 May 1905 in K√∂slin. His father, a railroad worker, died in 1917. Zierke joined the Nazi Party and SA in 1930. He trained as a nurse at the Neuruppin hospital and eventually received a permanent civil service appointment. In late 1939, he was recruited by Action T4 and worked as staff in the euthanasia program at both the Grafeneck and Hadamar gassing centers. Zierke was transferred to Eichberg euthanasia center in late 1941. From January to March 1942, he was part of T4's Organisation Todt in the Soviet Union, then returned to Eichberg.Henry Friedlander (1995).

He then worked briefly at the Dorohucza transit camp, from which he was sent to Sobib√≥r extermination camp on 5 November 1943. Zierke's final task at Sobibor was to supervise the dismantling of the camp's structures. He participated in the mass murder of the last group of more than thirty commando Jews (Arbeitsjuden) who had dismantled the camp at Sobibor. In the hands-on killings, Zierke was aided by SS-Unterscharf√ºhrer Erich Sporleder, and SS- Scharf√ºhrer Robert J√ºhrs. In December 1943 he was ordered to Italy to serve with Globocnik (his death camp superior), at Risiera di San Sabba camp complex. After the end of the war Zierke was arrested in a POW camp and released. He became a saw mill worker.Sobibor - The Forgotten Revolt. Internet Archive. Zierke was rearrested on 31 January 1963 in West Germany along with a group of Holocaust perpetrators facing trial. He was acquitted twice, both at the Be≈Ç≈ºec Trial in Munich in 1964, and at the Sobibor Trial in Hagen (1965).

Sheila Connolly (born 1950) is a mystery writer and author of three mystery series published by Berkley Prime Crime. She passed away April 20, 2020 in Ireland. Career The Glassblowing Mystery series, written under the pen name Sarah Atwell, debuted in March 2008 with ‚ÄúThrough a Glass, Deadly‚Äù. In the series, the protagonist, glassblower Em Dowell, manages her own glass shop and studio in Tucson, Arizona, and tries to find time to solve the occasional murder. ‚ÄúThrough a Glass, Deadly‚Äù was nominated for a national mystery award, the Agatha Award for Best First Book. Connolly's Orchard Mystery series opened with ‚ÄúOne Bad Apple‚Äù, published in August 2008. Meg Corey inherits a drafty colonial house in western Massachusetts without even realizing it comes with an apple orchard. But since she's been downsized out of her banking job in Boston, and the real estate market is so bad that she can't sell the house, she decides to stay on in the small New England town and try to manage the orchard‚Äìif she can save it from developers. Her plan is nearly derailed when she finds the body of her ex- boyfriend stuffed in her septic tank. Connolly's Museum Mysteries began in October 2010 with ‚ÄúFundraising the Dead‚Äù. Nell Pratt, development director for the prestigious Pennsylvania Antiquarian Society, is worried that the institution's reputation will be threatened by the death of one of its key employees‚Äìwhose body Nell found in the stacks. The police declare the death an accident, but Nell isn't so sure, particularly when she finds information pointing in a different direction. Most recently, the author published Let's Play Dead, set at a children's museum based on the Please Touch Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A worker on an exhibit about a local children's author is hurt by electric shock, and then another worker is killed by a shock. Nell was present at the first incident, and she becomes involved in the inquiry into the second man's death. the latest is Fire Engine Dead, about a fire at a warehouse housing the collections of a fire fighting museum. Connolly was born in Rochester, New York, and later lived in Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, California, and Massachusetts. In 1972 she graduated with honors from Wellesley College, then earned a Ph.D. in Fine Arts from Harvard University. When art history jobs proved elusive, she obtained an M.B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley. She worked as an art historian, a municipal financial advisor for U.S. cities and states, a non-profit fundraiser for institutions and two statewide political campaigns, and a professional genealogist. She included elements of all of these in her mysteries. Connolly was a member of Mystery Writers of America, Romance Writers of America, and Sisters in Crime. She was living in southeastern Massachusetts at the time of her death.

Other techniques to reduce leakage, like power gating and SRAM retention, are targeted at reducing leakage power when the device, or portions of it, are not operating. Short channel length devices provide higher performance than longer channel length devices, but the longer channel length has significantly reduced subthreshold leakage current. In this generation of the power management tool box, two channel lengths summarized in the table below were used for the speed vs. leakage trade-off. Timing-critical paths are constructed of short channel length cells, but for non timing-critical paths, the longer channel length cells can be used to trade off speed for lower leakage. Multiple channel length synthesis achieves up to 30% leakage reduction. One additional usage of longer channel length transistors is for always-on logic and for special power management cells (isolation cells, always on buffers, etc.) where speed is not critical.

Early life Cole was born on February 9, 1952 to Lillian and Maxwell Cole. She has two siblings, Ellen Cole and Peter Cole. In 1970 she graduated from Forest Hill Collegiate, where she was the first female to be elected president of the student council. She later received her Bachelor of Arts in Classics at Harvard College, where she helped found the university's first women's collective in 1970. She received the Rockefeller Fellowship from Harvard College in 1974 and spent her fellowship year traveling to Greece. Early work Cole began her work life as a story editor for the news magazine television show The Education of Mike McManus at what is now TVOntario. While on the job she met author and Maclean's editor Peter C. Newman who, in 1976, made her his principal researcher for his book The Bronfman Dynasty (McClelland & Stewart). While working for Newman, Cole helped found the Broadside Collective,Speaking of Truth and Power which produced a monthly feminist magazine from 1978 to 1988. Access to all issues can be found at the Women's Archives in Ottawa. During this period, Cole began her work on pornography, developing a feminist analysis that paved the way for her upcoming books. Anti-pornography activism Cole was a member of Women Against Violence Against Women (WAVAW), when the movie Snuff, a pornographic flick bragging that it featured the murder of a woman as a sexual spectacle, came to Toronto in 1978. She spoke at a rally outside Cinema 2000, where the film was showing, urging demonstrators to head to the theatre to shut it down and to set off a series of demonstrations outside the theatre. WAVAW went on to focus on several actions, including erecting an alternative cenotaph on Remembrance Day acknowledging ‚ÄúEvery Woman Raped In Every War.‚Äù Cole's anti- pornography activism triggered her public speaking career, as she travelled across Canada to talk about pornography. She published Pornography and the Sex Crisis (Second Story) in 1988, which encapsulated her point of view and which expanded her speaking engagements, including a series of debates on college campuses with Al Goldstein, editor of Screw. In 1995, she published Power Surge: Sex Violence and Pornography (Second Story), a collection of articles she wrote in Broadside, in the anthologies Still Ain‚Äôt Satisfied and No Safe Place (both available from Second Story Press) and in NOW, where she was then a contributing editor and is now books and senior entertainment editor.

The performance inspired Nightwood to commission a full-length play, which Cole completed in 1991. Her comedy, A Fertile Imagination, debuted in 1991 with Nightwood under the direction of Kate Lushington and received seven subsequent productions across Canada. Playwrights Canada Press engaged Cole to collect and edit a series of lesbian monologues from Canadian plays.

She now programs the Proud Voices literary stages at Toronto's Pride Week celebrations. Music In the late 1970s, Cole was the co-founder of the Toronto all-women's band, Mama Quilla II, alongside musicians such as Lorraine Segato and Lauri Conger. Cole left the group well prior to their only recording, a 1982 EP engineered by Daniel Lanois (by which time the group was no longer an all-female band). Mama Quilla II later evolved into Parachute Club, but Cole was not part of the new group, instead going on to play piano and write songs for No Frills with Sherry Shute, Catherine Mackay and Evelyne Datl. No Frills played the first Gay Pride march in Toronto in 1981. A track recorded by No Frills appears on The Rebel Zone soundtrack. Media Cole can be heard weekly on Toronto radio on CFMJ, where she sits on the Media and the Message panel on John Oakley's show every Thursday morning.

Anseth is working at the intersection of materials science, chemistry and biology, studying natural and synthetic hydrogels and using biomaterials to create an extracellular matrix to support three-dimensional cell enculturation. Anseth is developing photopolymers that will change from soft to hard in response to cues such as ultraviolet light, and then degrade predictably over time. Such materials could be used to for orthopedic repairs, functioning as a replacement for damaged areas of bone and then slowly being replaced by regrowth of natural material as the body heals. Her pioneering approach applies photopolymerization and photodegradation to enable precise control in space and time of hydrogels' structure and composition. This research involves fundamental investigations into the molecular dynamics of processes at the cell-biomaterial interface. Anseth is also working on the tissue engineering of biomaterials for the replacement of cartilage and heart valves. By combining photopolymers and lab-grown cartilage her lab is creating living replacements for worn-out joints. The problem is more difficult than replacing bone because the cartilage in joints, unlike bone, does not have the ability to regrow. She has published more than 250 papers and filed for at least 18 patents. She has been involved in editorial activities of journals including Biomacromolecules, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research ‚Äî Part A, Acta Biomaterialia, Progress in Materials Science, Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. In September 2014, she was elected the Vice President/President-Elect of the Materials Research Society (MRS), serving as Vice President in 2015 and President in 2016. Awards and honors In 1999, Anseth was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35. Kristi Anseth was the first engineer, male or female, to be selected as a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator. At age 40, she was the youngest member ever to be elected to both the National Academy of Engineering (2009) and the Institute of Medicine (2009). In 2013, she was also elected to the National Academy of Sciences. She shares the distinction of being a member of all three with chemical engineers Cato Laurencin, Robert S. Langer, Nicholas A. Peppas, Frances Arnold, and Rakesh K. Jain. As of 2015, she was also named to the National Academy of Inventors. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2019.

In the spring of 1968, several groups of people in Portland were discussing starting an \\"underground\\" newspaper in Portland, similar to the L.A. Free Press or the Berkeley Barb. They were partially motivated by a frustration with the reporting in the mainstream press, which was still supporting the Vietnam war, opposing progressive movements like the United Farmworkers Union, and showed no understanding at all of the growing \\"Counterculture\\" and its music, dress and mores. On the other hand, they saw many things going on in the city that were positive, but isolated- Antiwar activity at Reed College, \\"Hippies\\" gathering around Lair Hill park, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party gathering strength, craft stores and head shops opening around town, local bands like The Great Pumpkin and The Portland Zoo giving concerts. A newspaper could bring these groups together and break the information monopoly of the daily papers.Michael Wells, Willamette Bridge editor and publisher, Oct 29, 2015 After a few meetings, three of these groups joined forces and the Willamette Bridge was born. The people who started The Bridge (as it came to be known) didn't think of themselves as just \\"journalists\\", per se- but rather, as communicators, community organizers. They saw their role as spreading the word about what was happening in the city and the world, and hoping that just spreading that information would help change the community.Michael Wells, Willamette Bridge editor and publisher, Oct 29, 2015 The first issue of The Willamette Bridge carried this statement of purpose: To provide a means by which Portland's various liberal groups can learn of each other's activities; To be a bridge between these groups and the city officials, businessmen, parents and general citizenry; To provide a platform from which controversial issues and topics can be discussed; To print news that the mainstream press ignores, either by accident or by design; To give another slant to news that we feel is being distorted. And, hopefully, to establish more understanding among all of the peoples of the city.Willamette Bridge, Vol 1, Issue 1 It continued \\"...We feel that opinions are not and cannot be confined to the editorial page, so we will not attempt to appear objective about material we have definite feelings about.\\"Willamette Bridge, Vol 1, Issue 1 \\"The Bridge\\" was a member of the Underground Press Syndicate and the Liberation News Service.

The IEP is chaired by technology entrepreneur Steve Killelea founder of Integrated Research.  Organization  IEP develops global and national peace indices, calculating the economic cost of violence, analysing country level risk and understanding the conditions which underpin highly peaceful societies IEP produce frameworks to define peacefulness, providing metrics for measurement, uncovering the relationship between peace, business, and prosperity, and by promoting a better understanding of the cultural, economic, and political factors that drive peacefulness.  Partners  IEP works in partnership with a number of think tanks, NGOs and academic institutions including the Aspen Institute, Center for Strategic and International Studies, International Peace Institute, Open Society Foundations, and King's College London. It also collaborates with intergovernmental organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) , the Commonwealth Secretariat, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UNICEF, NATO, the World Bank Group, and UN Peacebuilding Support Office.http://www.un.org/en/peacebuilding/pbso Since 2015, IEP has been an active member of the UN Global Compact Expert Group on Responsible Business and Investment in High-Risk Areas. IEP has a strategic partnership with Rotary International and One Young World, which involves training of Global Peace Index Ambassadors the program focuses on engaging young leaders in understanding IEP‚Äôs empirical peace research. IEP is also a member of the Sustainable Development Goal 16 Data Initiative, which is a consortium that compiles existing global data to assist in tracking progress towards achieving Goal 16.  Programs =Global Peace Index  The core asset of the IEP is the Global Peace Index (GPI), which is now considered the benchmark study in measuring peace. The GPI has been recognized by leading analysts and institutions, and has been incorporated into reports such as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's Year Book (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016), and was analyzed by the World Bank's World Development Report 2011 team. The data for the GPI is collected and collated in collaboration with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the research and analysis arm of the Economist Group, and the methodology is informed and reviewed each year by an international panel of peace and statistics experts. The GPI is released annually with presentations typically held in London, Washington, D.C., Geneva, Paris, New York City, Sydney, Brussels and The Hague. The GPI is used by various international organizations, such as the UN and World Bank as a source of data and information as well as being used by academics and universities around the world. In addition, the GPI was the empirical basis for the Symposium of Peaceful Nations, a 3-day conference hosted in November 2009 to honor the most peaceful countries in each of nine regions of the world at which Helen Clark, UNDP Administrator, delivered the keynote address. The Institute for Economics & Peace, in 2016, marked 10 years of measuring and analysing global levels of peace. In celebration of this milestone, IEP along with the Diplomatic Courier Magazine hosted the Future of Peace Summit in Washington D.C. The 11th annual GPI launched in June 2017 includes 163 countries in the world, and the interactive map on the website explains the rankings. The 2017 GPI recorded a small improvement in average global peace, with 93 countries recording higher levels of peace and 68 recording a deterioration. National Peace Indices IEP has also launched a series of National Peace Indices. The first one was the United States Peace Index (USPI) in April 2011. The USPI ranks each state in the US by peacefulness and, unlike the GPI, uses only 5 indicators: incarceration rate, the number of police officers, the number of homicides, the availability of small arms, and the number of violent crimes. In 2011 Maine was ranked the most peaceful state, while Louisiana was the least peaceful. The UK Peace Index was conducted in 2013. The UK Peace Index provides a comprehensive measure of the levels of peacefulness within the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2012. The Mexico Peace Index (MPI) is the latest in the series of National Peace Indices. There have been 4 editions of the MPI to date, the first published in 2013, and most recently 2017. The MPI uses five indicators to gauge the level of peace in the 32 Mexican states from 2003-2016. The indicators are: Homicide rates, violent crime, detention without a sentence, weapons crime and organised crime. An expert panel is engaged to provide independent advice and technical guidance in developing the methodology, these experts are from independent, non-partisan, civil society and academic organisations. The 2017 MPI found that peacefulness deteriorated by 4.3% in 2016, however the homicide rate rose by 18.4% in the same year. Yucat√°n is the most peaceful state in Mexico, while Guerrero is the least peaceful state. The data used to calculate the MPI comes from government bodies in Mexico, and IEP uses survey data collection by the national statistical office to adjust the figures for under reporting. Global Terrorism Index Another flagship report of the IEP is the Global Terrorism Index (GTI) which provides a comprehensive summary of the key global trends and patterns in terrorism. The report analyses data spanning the past 16 years and four editions having been released to date. The GTI is based on data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). It ranks 163 countries based on four indicators, those indicators are; number of terrorist incidents in a given year, number of fatalities from terrorist incidents in a given year, number of injuries caused by terrorist in a given year and measure of the total property damage from terrorist incidents in a given year. The 2016 GTI report found a ten per cent decrease in the number of deaths from terrorism in 2015 resulted in 3,389 fewer deaths than 2014, a global total of 29,376 deaths made 2015 the second deadliest year on record.  The Economic Value of Peace  The Economic Value of Peace report estimates of the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy. It provides an empirical basis to calculate the potential additional economic benefits from improvements in peace. It estimates the economic impact of violence for 163 countries and independent territories representing 99.5 per cent of the global economy and population. The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion PPP in 2016, equivalent to 12.6% of global GDP, or $1,953 per person, this figure represented the first decline in the economic impact of violence since 2011, which is the year that corresponded with the start of the Syrian war and ISIL's territorial gains in Iraq. Global Peace Report On October 26, 2010, IEP and Peace and Media Tenor released ‚ÄúMeasuring Peace in the Media‚Äù, the first study that takes a fact-based approach into understanding the accuracy of international television networks‚Äô coverage of peace, violence and conflict. The results show broad inconsistencies across geographies and networks, with US broadcasters much more focused on violence and conflict than their European and Middle Eastern counterparts. Al Jazeera was found to be the network providing the most balanced coverage on Afghanistan. BBC World led the way when it came to breadth of coverage. It regularly reported on 67 countries across six continents which is nearly twice as many countries as the average level of coverage. The study analysed 37 TV news and current affairs programmes from 23 networks in 15 countries* and then cross-referenced this with the Global Peace Index which measures the levels of peace and violence in 149 countries. BBC 2 Newsnight and ZDF Heute Journal (Germany) were found to be the programmes whose editorial policies aligned their coverage most closely with the rankings of the GPI. Positive-peace stories make up just 1.6% of the total number of stories examined in the study. These are stories that report on active steps taken to rectify violent situations. Such a small percentage may be partly related to what is considered newsworthy and dramatic, such as high-impact, violent or controversial events. However, the stereotyping of nations which are low on the GPI makes it harder for audiences to gain empathy and therefore to support governments and make headway towards creating peace.  Positive Peace  Positive Peace is an innovative and empirically based framework which has been developed by IEP to identify and understand the factors which are statistically associated with peaceful and resilient societies. Positive Peace is measured by IEP on the Positive Peace Index (PPI). While the Global Peace Index measures 'Negative Peace' being the absence of violence or fear of violence, Positive Peace represents the capacity for a society to meet the needs of its citizens, reduce and deal with grievances without the use of violence. The framework is based on the quantitatively identifiable common characteristics of the world's most peaceful societies. The defining feature of IEP‚Äôs Positive Peace framework is the systems approach to peace. IEP research has demonstrated that high levels of peacefulness are associated with strength in not just one, but all eight factors of Positive Peace. All domains are highly interrelated and work together systemically in producing a peaceful society.  Reception  The Global Go To Think Tank Index listed the Institute for Economics and Peace as a \\"Think Tank to Watch\\", and as one of the top 20 most impactful Think Tanks worldwide with a Budget under $5 Million. In 2013, Steve Killelea‚Äôs founding of IEP was recognized as one of the 50 most impactful philanthropic gifts in Australia‚Äôs history by a coalition including the Myer Family Company, The Myer Foundation and Sidney Myer Fund, Pro Bono Australia, Swinburne University and Philanthropy Australia.

Biography=Early life Spurgeon Hart Neel Jr, was born on September 24, 1919 in Memphis, Tennessee. His parents were Spurgeon Hart Neel and Leola Pearl Neel. Spurgeon Neel graduated from the Memphis State University in 1939, majoring in pre-med. He earned his Doctorate of Medicine in 1942 from the University of Tennessee. Dr. Neel was a member of Phi Chi Medical Fraternity's Alpha Beta Chapter. Neel completed an internship at the Methodist Hospital in Memphis in 1943. He then entered military service, completing his residency in radiology at Santa Ana Army Air Base in California in 1944. Neel married his wife, Alice T. Neel, in 1940. They had a son, Spurgeon H. Neel III, and daughter, Dr. Leah Neel Zartarian. World War II Neel commanded a medical company in Europe during World War II. Aeromedical evacuation From 1949 to 1951, Neel served as surgeon with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In 1949, Neel chaired a board that tested, evaluated, and recommended the use of the helicopter in medical evacuation roles. The concept of utilizing rotary wing aircraft for the evacuation of seriously wounded casualties was not a new one. In 1936, at the Medical Field Service School at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, an autogyro was field-tested as an evacuation vehicle. The idea was discarded at that time for engineering and budgetary reasons more than any defect in the basic concept. During World War II the Air Force and Navy began to use helicopters for the rescue of pilots and other personnel lost at sea or in inaccessible terrain. However, helicopters were still a novelty in 1949 when Neel began examining the idea of flying wounded soldiers out of war zones. Neel's widow, Alice Neel, told the San Antonio Express-News that Neel had said, \\"My job is to take care of those boys. And I'm going to do it, and I want to be able to get them to the hospital as quickly as possible, and I want the helicopter to be dedicated for that purpose and to be available for that mission.'\\" As part of his 1949 study, Neel tested an early Kaman helicopter with forward clamshell doors. Neel also explored other medical aspects of army aviation. In 1951, he published the paper \\"Medical Aspects of Military Parachuting,\\" which was recognized by the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States as the best military medical essay of the year. In March 1951, Neel became the first Army graduate of the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Korean War It was in the Korean War that helicopter evacuation became a reality. The helicopter had finally been accepted as an organic vehicle of the Army, and rugged terrain of Korea made surface transport arduous. In addition, the scarcity of hard-surface roads and harsh climate often made it extremely difficult to transport casualties from forward units. Helicopter evacuation in Korea was not the result of any preconceived plan; it was the result of expediency. In the early days of the war, a U.S. Air Force helicopter detachment of the Third Air Rescue Squadron began to receive requests from ground elements for the evacuation of casualties from difficult terrain. Since this detachment was not fully occupied with its primary mission of rescuing downed pilots, it responded to these calls. By August 1950, this Air Force unit was answering so many calls that it found itself in the medical evacuation business. Quick to note the advantages of helicopter evacuation in terrain such as Korea, the Eighth Army developed an increased interest in the program. During a significant test conducted by Army and Air Force representatives on August 3, 1950 in the school yard of the Taegu Teachers College, Army helicopters were adopted for the evacuation of casualties and the first procedures were established. On 22 November 1950 the Army's Second Helicopter Detachment arrived in Korea, equipped with four H-13 aircraft. Army helicopter evacuation was officially established on 1 January 1951 when the Second Helicopter Detachment became operational and was attached to the 8055th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. In January 1951, two more helicopter detachments, the Third and Fourth, arrived in Korea with minimum operating personnel and four H-13 aircraft, followed in February by the First Helicopter Detachment. At this time all helicopter detachments used in medical evacuation were assigned to the 8085th Army Unit, Eighth Army Flight Detachment, and attached to forward surgical hospitals. Before the armistice ended the war in 1953, army helicopters would fly 18,000 U.N. casualties to hospitals, helping save seven of every 10 victims. Neel spent most of the war in the U.S., first in Washington D.C., and then in San Antonio, Texas. From 1952 to 1953, Neel served as Chief of the Field Medical Service Branch of the Medical Field Service School at Fort Sam Houston near San Antonio. He led the establishment of helicopter ambulance units and supervised the activation, training, and deployment of five helicopter ambulance detachments at Brooke Army Medical Center. Neel transferred to Korea in 1953 before the armistice ended active hostilities on July 27. Neel served as commander of the 30th Medical Group in Korea from 1953-1954. He established the Eighth Army aviation medical program in 1954, which became the prototype for the Army-wide aviation medical program. The aeromedical evacuation doctrine espoused by Neel called for medical control of evacuation and the need for pilots and aircraft dedicated to that mission alone. Field maneuvers after Korea included use of aeromedical evacuation. Post war From 1954-1957, Neel served at the U.S. Army Office of the Surgeon General in Washington, D.C. After the Korean War the Surgeon General's Office applied itself to assessing the potential of helicopter ambulances in future conflicts. In particular, Lt. Col. Neel, in a number of medical and aviation journals, publicized and promoted the Army's air ambulances. The Korean experience, he realized, could not serve as an infallible guide to the use of helicopters in other types of wars and different geographical regions, but it certainly showed that helicopters had made possible at least a modification of the first links in Letterman's chain of evacuation. A superior communications system would allow a well-equipped and well-staffed ambulance to land at or near the site of the wounding, making much ground evacuation unnecessary. If the patient's condition could be stabilized briefly, it might prove helpful to use the speed of the helicopter to evacuate the patient farther to the rear, to more complete medical facilities than those provided at a rudimentary division clearing station. Triage might be carried out better at a hospital than in the field. Based on experience during the Korean War, Neel developed medical evacuation policies, procedures, and organizations which are the foundation of current aeromedical operations. In 1954, Neel became the Army's first Aviation Medical Officer. In 1955 he served on the Department of the Army board which conducted a design competition to select the new standard Army utility helicopter, which ultimately became the UH-1. The same year he established flying status for Aviation Medical Officers and was the first Aviation Medical Officer to receive flying status. In 1956, Neel established the Aviation Branch within the Office of the Surgeon General and became its first chief, later designing the Aviation Medical Officer Badge and becoming its first recipient. Neel also established a formal program for Board Certification of Army Medical Officers in Aviation Medicine and laid the groundwork for the Army Aviation Medical Training and Research Program. Neel designed the Aviation Medical Officer badge in 1957. Neel was the first to be awarded the badge. From 1957 to 1958, Neel was a student at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, where he received the degree Master of Public Health. United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks Air Force Base from 1959 to 1960. Neel assumed command of the U.S. Army Hospital at Fort Rucker, Alabama in 1961. He established the Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory at Ft. Rucker. He also initiated construction of the Lyster Army Hospital, a modern facility with specialized aviation medicine capability. Neel was awarded a Master's of Science in Business Administration from George Washington University in 1965. Vietnam During the Vietnam War, Neel served as surgeon with the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam from 1965 to 1966. Neal served as Senior Medical Advisor to General William Westmoreland. Neal coordinated introduction of medical air ambulance units during the build-up. He also established the Saigon office of the Far East Joint Medical Regulating Office to manage patient movements within and from the Republic of Vietnam during the war. He coordinated U.S. Army aeromedical evacuation in support of U.S. and South Vietnam forces and Vietnamese civilians. In Vietnam, the Army formed \\"dustoff\\" units, named for a radio call sign, which evacuated about 380,000 patients. In recognition of his role in the development and execution of combat zone medical operations, Neel was awarded the Major Gary P. Wratten Award of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States in 1967. Neel returned to the U.S. in 1966 and was assigned to the U.S. Army's Office of the Surgeon General in Washington, D.C. as Director of Plans, Supply, and Operations. Command Photograph of Brigadier General Spurgeon Neel, 44th Medical Brigade, 1968-1969 Neel served a second tour in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969. He served as Commanding General of the 44th Medical Brigade and as Surgeon of the United States Army, Vietnam Neels innovations in battlefield medicine greatly improved the survival rates for wounded soldiers. In World War I, 8 percent of all injured men died of their injuries; in World War II, 4.5 percent; in Korea, 2.5 percent; and in Vietnam, 1.5 percent. Neel attributed the lowering mortality rate to (1) the helicopter, (2) whole blood, (3) hospitals, and (4) highly trained personnel. As Neel pointed out, it was the medic under fire in whose hands rested the life-or-death decision for the wounded man. The length of hospitalization for Vietnam victims was half of what it was for injured men in Korea-‚Äî48 days for Vietnam compared to 91 days for Korea. Neel attributed this improvement to the swiftness of helicopter evacuation and the advances in medical technology. Return to U.S. Neel served as Deputy Surgeon General of the U.S. Army in Washington D.C. from 1969 to 1973. Neel wrote a book entitled Medical Support of the U.S. Army in Vietnam 1965-1970 that was published by the Department of the Army in 1973. Neel moved to San Antonio in 1973 to become the first Commanding General of the U.S. Army Health Services Command. Health Services Command was activated on 1 April 1973 as part of reorganizing the Army Medical Department. It took control of almost all Army medical facilities in the continental US, including medical education. It answered directly to the Chief of Staff of the Army. This allowed the Office of the Surgeon General to focus more on staff and technical supervisory duties as the principal adviser to the Chief of Staff of the Army on health and medical matters. In 1994, the HSC and Office of the Surgeon General were merged again. Neel advocated civilian air ambulance systems and oversaw formation of the 507th Medical Company, which provided military assistance to safety and traffic. By rescuing more than 5,000 civilians from car wrecks, floods and trauma cases in and around San Antonio, the Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic (MAST) program further promoted air ambulance service. Retirement Neel retired from the U.S. Army in 1977 with the rank of Major General. After his army retirement, Neel served as Professor in Occupational and Aerospace Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center. Neel served as honorary colonel of the Army Medical Department Regiment from 1986 to 1994. The regiment was activated on 28 July 1986 as part of the creation of the Army Regimental System to foster and cohesion. All medical officers and enlisted personnel were formally affiliated with the regiment, to include wearing the departmental crest on their uniforms. Neel was the first honorary colonel. Primarily a ceremonial position, Neel's role was to enhance morale and esprit de corps through the perpetuation of the regiment's traditions and customs. During retirement, Neel also served as Medical Director of USAA, the insurance association serving military personnel. He also served on the Board of Directors at Eisenhower National Bank for 10 years. Neel helped establish the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) Museum at Fort Sam Houston. Neel served as chairman of the museum board that was responsible for the expansion of the museum. Death Neel died at the age of 83 on June 6, 2003 in San Antonio, Texas. He was buried at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, Section A1, Site 526. Awards Neel was award the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with four oak leaf clusters, the Bronze Star with one oak leaf cluster, and the Purple Heart. Neel was inducted into the Army Aviation Hall of Fame in 1976. Legacy *In 2006, the Spurgeon Neel Evacuation Pavilion was established at the Army Medical Department Museum at Fort Sam Houston as a memorial to Neel's work.

It is officially known as the Manchester Airport Eastern Link and runs between Manchester Airport and the A6 south of Hazel Grove.  History  The earliest section of the A555 was completed in 1995, part of an abandoned scheme to connect Stockport, Hazel Grove and Poynton to Manchester Airport. It was intended as a relief road to ease congestion. The original plan, which dated from the 1940s, was to build a bypass connecting Bredbury and Hazel Grove, and from Hazel Grove to Woodford, bypassing Poynton. The road would then run from Woodford to Handforth, as it does now, and then on to the airport. However, only the middle section, which crosses the A34 Handforth bypass (built at the same time) was completed, due to money shortage. Central section Until 2018, the route ran from the border of Woodford and Bramhall at a junction with the A5102, heading westward for approximately 2 miles before it reaches the A34 Handforth bypass, which is accessed by a grade-separated junction. Close to this is Handforth Dean retail outlet, consisting of Tesco Extra and Marks & Spencer. The route ended at a double- headed roundabout with the B5358, on the border of Handforth and Heald Green, approximately three miles from the airport.  Expansion  In November 2008, money was pledged by transport secretary Geoff Hoon to extend the route to Hazel Grove, and complete the link to the airport. However, following the change in government at the 2010 general election, the plans were placed on hold once more. Then, in November 2011, the government finally approved plans to complete the link, as part of a major programme of infrastructure investment. The A6 to Manchester Airport Relief Road, which completes the route between Hazel Grove and the airport using the A555, gained its final approval in March 2015 and was scheduled for completion and opening in spring 2018. Persistent heavy rain from December 2017 to February 2018 and the collapse of Carillion delayed the opening date until later in the year. An activity day including a 5 km fun run took place on Sunday 7 October as a precursor to full openingA6MARR set to open to traffic, SEMMMS and the bypass opened for general use on Monday 15 October 2018, at 0600.

The proofs are probabilistic ‚Äî they work by showing that a random object, chosen from some probability distribution, has the desired properties with positive probability. Consequently, they are nonconstructive ‚Äî they don't explicitly describe an efficient method for computing the desired objects. The method of conditional probabilities , converts such a proof, in a \\"very precise sense\\", into an efficient deterministic algorithm, one that is guaranteed to compute an object with the desired properties. That is, the method derandomizes the proof. The basic idea is to replace each random choice in a random experiment by a deterministic choice, so as to keep the conditional probability of failure, given the choices so far, below 1. The method is particularly relevant in the context of randomized rounding (which uses the probabilistic method to design approximation algorithms). When applying the method of conditional probabilities, the technical term pessimistic estimator refers to a quantity used in place of the true conditional probability (or conditional expectation) underlying the proof.  Overview  gives this description: : We first show the existence of a provably good approximate solution using the probabilistic method... [We then] show that the probabilistic existence proof can be converted, in a very precise sense, into a deterministic approximation algorithm. (Raghavan is discussing the method in the context of randomized rounding, but it works with the probabilistic method in general.) The method of conditional probabilities To apply the method to a probabilistic proof, the randomly chosen object in the proof must be choosable by a random experiment that consists of a sequence of \\"small\\" random choices. Here is a trivial example to illustrate the principle. : Lemma: It is possible to flip three coins so that the number of tails is at least 2. : Probabilistic proof. If the three coins are flipped randomly, the expected number of tails is 1.5. Thus, there must be some outcome (way of flipping the coins) so that the number of tails is at least 1.5. Since the number of tails is an integer, in such an outcome there are at least 2 tails. QED In this example the random experiment consists of flipping three fair coins. The experiment is illustrated by the rooted tree in the adjacent diagram. There are eight outcomes, each corresponding to a leaf in the tree. A trial of the random experiment corresponds to taking a random walk from the root (the top node in the tree, where no coins have been flipped) to a leaf. The successful outcomes are those in which at least two coins came up tails. The interior nodes in the tree correspond to partially determined outcomes, where only 0, 1, or 2 of the coins have been flipped so far. To apply the method of conditional probabilities, one focuses on the conditional probability of failure, given the choices so far as the experiment proceeds step by step. In the diagram, each node is labeled with this conditional probability. (For example, if only the first coin has been flipped, and it comes up tails, that corresponds to the second child of the root. Conditioned on that partial state, the probability of failure is 0.25.) The method of conditional probabilities replaces the random root-to-leaf walk in the random experiment by a deterministic root-to-leaf walk, where each step is chosen to inductively maintain the following invariant: :: the conditional probability of failure, given the current state, is less than 1. In this way, it is guaranteed to arrive at a leaf with label 0, that is, a successful outcome. The invariant holds initially (at the root), because the original proof showed that the (unconditioned) probability of failure is less than 1. The conditional probability at any interior node is the average of the conditional probabilities of its children. The latter property is important because it implies that any interior node whose conditional probability is less than 1 has at least one child whose conditional probability is less than 1. Thus, from any interior node, one can always choose some child to walk to so as to maintain the invariant. Since the invariant holds at the end, when the walk arrives at a leaf and all choices have been determined, the outcome reached in this way must be a successful one.  Efficiency  In a typical application of the method, the goal is to be able to implement the resulting deterministic process by a reasonably efficient algorithm (the word \\"efficient\\" usually means an algorithm that runs in polynomial time), even though typically the number of possible outcomes is huge (exponentially large). For example, consider the task with coin flipping, but extended to n flips for large n. In the ideal case, given a partial state (a node in the tree), the conditional probability of failure (the label on the node) can be efficiently and exactly computed. (The example above is like this.) If this is so, then the algorithm can select the next node to go to by computing the conditional probabilities at each of the children of the current node, then moving to any child whose conditional probability is less than 1. As discussed above, there is guaranteed to be such a node. Unfortunately, in most applications, the conditional probability of failure is not easy to compute efficiently. There are two standard and related techniques for dealing with this: * Using a conditional expectation: Many probabilistic proofs work as follows: they implicitly define a random variable Q, show that (i) the expectation of Q is at most (or at least) some threshold value, and (ii) in any outcome where Q is at most (at least) this threshold, the outcome is a success. Then (i) implies that there exists an outcome where Q is at most the threshold, and this and (ii) imply that there is a successful outcome. (In the example above, Q is the number of tails, which should be at least the threshold 1.5. In many applications, Q is the number of \\"bad\\" events (not necessarily disjoint) that occur in a given outcome, where each bad event corresponds to one way the experiment can fail, and the expected number of bad events that occur is less than 1.) In this case, to keep the conditional probability of failure below 1, it suffices to keep the conditional expectation of Q below (or above) the threshold. To do this, instead of computing the conditional probability of failure, the algorithm computes the conditional expectation of Q and proceeds accordingly: at each interior node, there is some child whose conditional expectation is at most (at least) the node's conditional expectation; the algorithm moves from the current node to such a child, thus keeping the conditional expectation below (above) the threshold. * Using a pessimistic estimator: In some cases, as a proxy for the exact conditional expectation of the quantity Q, one uses an appropriately tight bound called a pessimistic estimator. The pessimistic estimator is a function of the current state. It should be an upper (or lower) bound for the conditional expectation of Q given the current state, and it should be non-increasing (or non-decreasing) in expectation with each random step of the experiment. Typically, a good pessimistic estimator can be computed by precisely deconstructing the logic of the original proof.  Example using conditional expectations  This example demonstrates the method of conditional probabilities using a conditional expectation.  Max-Cut Lemma  Given any undirected graph G = (V, E), the Max cut problem is to color each vertex of the graph with one of two colors (say black or white) so as to maximize the number of edges whose endpoints have different colors. (Say such an edge is cut.) Max-Cut Lemma: In any graph G = (V, E), at least E/2 edges can be cut. > Probabilistic proof. Color each vertex black or white by flipping a fair > coin. By calculation, for any edge e in E, the probability that it is cut is > 1/2. Thus, by linearity of expectation, the expected number of edges cut is > E/2. Thus, there exists a coloring that cuts at least E/2 edges. QED  The method of conditional probabilities with conditional expectations  To apply the method of conditional probabilities, first model the random experiment as a sequence of small random steps. In this case it is natural to consider each step to be the choice of color for a particular vertex (so there are V steps). Next, replace the random choice at each step by a deterministic choice, so as to keep the conditional probability of failure, given the vertices colored so far, below 1. (Here failure means that finally fewer than E/2 edges are cut.) In this case, the conditional probability of failure is not easy to calculate. Indeed, the original proof did not calculate the probability of failure directly; instead, the proof worked by showing that the expected number of cut edges was at least E/2. Let random variable Q be the number of edges cut. To keep the conditional probability of failure below 1, it suffices to keep the conditional expectation of Q at or above the threshold E/2. (This is because as long as the conditional expectation of Q is at least E/2, there must be some still-reachable outcome where Q is at least E/2, so the conditional probability of reaching such an outcome is positive.) To keep the conditional expectation of Q at E/2 or above, the algorithm will, at each step, color the vertex under consideration so as to maximize the resulting conditional expectation of Q. This suffices, because there must be some child whose conditional expectation is at least the current state's conditional expectation (and thus at least E/2). Given that some of the vertices are colored already, what is this conditional expectation? Following the logic of the original proof, the conditional expectation of the number of cut edges is :: the number of edges whose endpoints are colored differently so far :: + (1/2)*(the number of edges with at least one endpoint not yet colored).  Algorithm  The algorithm colors each vertex to maximize the resulting value of the above conditional expectation. This is guaranteed to keep the conditional expectation at E/2 or above, and so is guaranteed to keep the conditional probability of failure below 1, which in turn guarantees a successful outcome. By calculation, the algorithm simplifies to the following: 1\\\\. For each vertex u in V (in any order): 2\\\\. Consider the already-colored neighboring vertices of u. 3\\\\. Among these vertices, if more are black than white, then color u white. 4\\\\. Otherwise, color u black. Because of its derivation, this deterministic algorithm is guaranteed to cut at least half the edges of the given graph. (This makes it a 0.5-approximation algorithm for Max-cut.)  Example using pessimistic estimators  The next example demonstrates the use of pessimistic estimators.  Tur√°n's theorem  One way of stating Tur√°n's theorem is the following: : Any graph G = (V, E) contains an independent set of size at least V/(D+1), where D = 2E/V is the average degree of the graph.  Probabilistic proof of Tur√°n's theorem  Consider the following random process for constructing an independent set S: 1\\\\. Initialize S to be the empty set. 2\\\\. For each vertex u in V in random order: 3\\\\. If no neighbors of u are in S, add u to S 4\\\\. Return S. Clearly the process computes an independent set. Any vertex u that is considered before all of its neighbors will be added to S. Thus, letting d(u) denote the degree of u, the probability that u is added to S is at least 1/(d(u)+1). By linearity of expectation, the expected size of S is at least : \\\\sum_{u\\\\in V} \\\\frac{1}{d(u)+1} ~\\\\ge~\\\\frac{V}{D+1}. (The inequality above follows because 1/(x+1) is convex in x, so the left-hand side is minimized, subject to the sum of the degrees being fixed at 2E, when each d(u) = D = 2E/V.) QED  The method of conditional probabilities using pessimistic estimators  In this case, the random process has V steps. Each step considers some not-yet considered vertex u and adds u to S if none of its neighbors have yet been added. Let random variable Q be the number of vertices added to S. The proof shows that E[Q] ‚â• V/(D+1). We will replace each random step by a deterministic step that keeps the conditional expectation of Q at or above V/(D+1). This will ensure a successful outcome, that is, one in which the independent set S has size at least V/(D+1), realizing the bound in Tur√°n's theorem. Given that the first t steps have been taken, let S(t) denote the vertices added so far. Let R(t) denote those vertices that have not yet been considered, and that have no neighbors in S(t). Given the first t steps, following the reasoning in the original proof, any given vertex w in R(t) has conditional probability at least 1/(d(w)+1) of being added to S, so the conditional expectation of Q is at least : S^{(t)} ~+~ \\\\sum_{w\\\\in R^{(t)}} \\\\frac{1}{d(w)+1}. Let Q(t) denote the above quantity, which is called a pessimistic estimator for the conditional expectation. The proof showed that the pessimistic estimator is initially at least V/(D+1). (That is, Q(0) ‚â• V/(D+1).) The algorithm will make each choice to keep the pessimistic estimator from decreasing, that is, so that Q(t+1) ‚â• Q(t) for each t. Since the pessimistic estimator is a lower bound on the conditional expectation, this will ensure that the conditional expectation stays above V/(D+1), which in turn will ensure that the conditional probability of failure stays below 1. Let u be the vertex considered by the algorithm in the next ((t+1)-st) step. If u already has a neighbor in S, then u is not added to S and (by inspection of Q(t)), the pessimistic estimator is unchanged. If u does not have a neighbor in S, then u is added to S. By calculation, if u is chosen randomly from the remaining vertices, the expected increase in the pessimistic estimator is non-negative. [The calculation. Conditioned on choosing a vertex in R(t), the probability that a given term 1/(d(w)+1) is dropped from the sum in the pessimistic estimator is at most (d(w)+1)/R(t), so the expected decrease in each term in the sum is at most 1/R(t). There are R(t) terms in the sum. Thus, the expected decrease in the sum is at most 1. Meanwhile, the size of S increases by 1.] Thus, there must exist some choice of u that keeps the pessimistic estimator from decreasing.  Algorithm maximizing the pessimistic estimator  The algorithm below chooses each vertex u to maximize the resulting pessimistic estimator. By the previous considerations, this keeps the pessimistic estimator from decreasing and guarantees a successful outcome. Below, N(t)(u) denotes the neighbors of u in R(t) (that is, neighbors of u that are neither in S nor have a neighbor in S). 1\\\\. Initialize S to be the empty set. 2\\\\. While there exists a not-yet-considered vertex u with no neighbor in S: 3\\\\. Add such a vertex u to S where u minimizes \\\\sum_{w\\\\in N^{(t)}(u)\\\\cup{u}} \\\\frac{1}{d(w)+1}. 4\\\\. Return S.  Algorithms that don't maximize the pessimistic estimator  For the method of conditional probabilities to work, it suffices if the algorithm keeps the pessimistic estimator from decreasing (or increasing, as appropriate). The algorithm does not necessarily have to maximize (or minimize) the pessimistic estimator. This gives some flexibility in deriving the algorithm. The next two algorithms illustrate this. 1\\\\. Initialize S to be the empty set. 2\\\\. While there exists a vertex u in the graph with no neighbor in S: 3\\\\. Add such a vertex u to S, where u minimizes d(u) (the initial degree of u). 4\\\\. Return S. 1\\\\. Initialize S to be the empty set. 2\\\\. While the remaining graph is not empty: 3\\\\. Add a vertex u to S, where u has minimum degree in the remaining graph. 4\\\\. Delete u and all of its neighbors from the graph. 5\\\\. Return S. Each algorithm is analyzed with the same pessimistic estimator as before. With each step of either algorithm, the net increase in the pessimistic estimator is : 1 - \\\\sum_{w\\\\in N^{(t)}(u)\\\\cup{u}} \\\\frac{1}{d(w)+1}, where N(t)(u) denotes the neighbors of u in the remaining graph (that is, in R(t)). For the first algorithm, the net increase is non-negative because, by the choice of u, : \\\\sum_{w\\\\in N^{(t)}(u)\\\\cup{u}} \\\\frac{1}{d(w)+1} \\\\le (d(u)+1) \\\\frac{1}{d(u)+1} = 1 , where d(u) is the degree of u in the original graph. For the second algorithm, the net increase is non-negative because, by the choice of u, : \\\\sum_{w\\\\in N^{(t)}(u)\\\\cup{u}} \\\\frac{1}{d(w)+1} \\\\le (d'(u)+1) \\\\frac{1}{d'(u)+1} = 1 , where d‚Ä≤(u) is the degree of u in the remaining graph.

Early life and cavalry service Janzen was born in either of two locales, depending on the source. He was either born in Fronza, the Kingdom of Prussia, Janzen's page on The Aerodrome website. or in Gda≈Ñsk. As World War began, on 3 August 1914, Janzen volunteered for duty in 1st Leib- Husaren-Regiment. He was promoted to Leutnant der Reserve on 24 February 1916. Aviation service Janzen transferred to aviation duty on 4 May 1916. He trained with FEA 3 until 22 August, then forwarded to Kasta 12. He received his pilot's badge on 8 October, with the Second Class Iron Cross following the day after. He was assigned to combat with Royal Bavarian Jagdstaffel 23 on 28 November 1916. He scored his first aerial victory with them on 25 February 1917. His First Class Iron Cross was awarded on 29 March. On 16 October, he was transferred to Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 6. He scored three more victories between 30 November 1917 and 27 March 1918. Janzen in command On 28 March 1918, he was appointed to command of Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 4. He helmed Jasta 4 without scoring any victories through 3 May 1918. On that day, he was transferred to command of Jagdstaffel 6, whose Staffelfuhrer Wilhelm Reinhard, had moved up to the wing command of Jagdgeschwader I. The next day, Janzen became an ace by shooting down a Spad. On 9 May, he survived being downed by Captain Oliver Colin LeBoutillier; Janzen's plane's controls had been shot away, but he spun harmlessly to the ground. Janzen went on to rack up eight more wins through 7 June 1918. Two days later, his Fokker Dr.1's synchronization gear failed and Janzen shot off his own propeller while attacking a Spad. He was captured, but escaped in December. Postwar Janzen served in Flieger Staffel 120 of the Reichswehr from January through May 1920. Janzen died while in Russian captivity, on 18 October 1945.

Welch and released in 2008 by GMT Games as part of the Great Battles of History (GBoH) series of games (designed by Richard Berg and Mark Herman) on ancient warfare. Chandragupta simulates battles fought by the Mauryan Dynasty in ancient India, and in so doing, attempts to illuminate the features, challenges, and unique attributes of the Indian military system and culture during this period. Gameplay The game is a traditional Hex-and-counter style game. The game maps are covered with a hexagonal grid, each hex representing 70 yards of distance. Each turn represents about 15‚Äì20 minutes, although the rules are designed assuming a loose time scale. Each counter represents 300 to 1000 fighting troops, depending on size and type.Welch 2008, \\"Rules of Play\\" p. 2-6 Since little is known about the terrain, numbers of men or types of units engaged, methods of combat, leaders and so on, these games, despite their high level of detail, remain essentially speculative and fictional in nature.Welch 2008, \\"Scenario Book\\" p. 3 Play of Chandragupta follows the general sequence of the other hex-and-counter style board games, each player taking turns moving units, conducting combat, and resolving combat using an odds-based combat results table (CRT) using a die. As with the other games in the GBoH series, rules for leadership and command and control are emphasized, and players have the opportunity (depending upon leader quality) to conduct \\"extra\\" moves and/or \\"trump\\" an opponent, effectively cancelling activation of an opponent's leader. Combat results generally result in rout and/or retreat, and victory is achieved by (more commonly) forcing an opponent's army to quit the field when a certain threshold of losses has been achieved, or by (less commonly) obtaining a specific territorial objective.Welch 2008, \\"Rulebook\\" p. 35 Indian Military System Using period sources as well as research from largely Indian military historians, Chandragupta attempts to model specific features of what is believed to have been common features of the Mauryan military system. One of the most distinctive features is the catarangubala, or the \\"four-fold\\" army consisting of foot-soldiers (patti), car-warriors, or chariots (rathin), elephants (hastƒ´), and cavalry (a≈õva). Deployment of the catarangubala remained remarkably consistent throughout the period following the Vedic period (after which chariots and elephants came into full military use), through Arab invasion in the 7th century AD.Dikshitar 1987, p 154 The game simulates the catarungabala by representing the four divisions with distinctive counters whose use in play is governed by specific rules for movement, combat, and command-and-control. Another feature of the ancient Indian military system simulated in Chandragupta are rules for troop classes, based on a classification system with a long tradition preceding the Mauryan era. The classifications were hierarchical. At the apex of the hierarchy were the Maula or \\"hereditary\\" troops, who were professional soldiers and largely (though not exclusively) of the Kshatriya warrior-caste. Next where the Bhrta, or mercenary-class of troops, followed by the Srenis or Srenibala, who were essentially armed trade-guild levies, and lastly the Atavibalam, or \\"tribal\\" levies.Chakravarti 1993, pp 2-10 The game Chandragupta attempts to simulate the differing qualities of morale, leadership, and fighting ability of these various troop classes. Other sub-classes, such as Mitra and Amitra (deserters from enemy armies, prison conscripts and the like),Chakravarti 1993, p 7 but for interests of playability and simplicity the designers chose not to represent these additional classes in Chandragupta.Welch 2008, \\"Rules of Play,\\" pp 5-6 Scenarios Chandragupta has ten scenarios which simulate major battles from the founding of the Mauryan Dynasty under Chandragupta Maurya, through the Battle of Kalinga waged by Chandragupta's grandson, Ashoka: * Pataliputra, ca 319 BCE ‚Äì Chandragupta's first attempt to overthrow the Nanda dynasty, under the leadership of his mentor, the Brahmin Chanakya. This inaugural battle did not go well for Chandragupta, as he and his insurgents brashly attacked the capital without having consolidated their power base among the \\"hereditary\\" (i.e. Maula) military class. By all accounts they were defeated, forcing them to regroup in the countryside to build up their military strength and political support.Bhargava 1996, pp 124-5 The game posits a set-piece battle, with the Nandan imperial army facing down a rebellion of Chandragupta's mercenaries and allied insurgents on the plains outside of Pataliputra, the capital city of Magadha.Welch 2008, \\"Scenario Book\\" pp. 8-11 * Magadha, ca 317 BC‚ÄîThough Ugrasena Nanda apparently was a great conqueror and able ruler, his rich and powerful sons were not. As Ugrasena grew older, his sons' greed and corruption became intolerable.Bhargava 1996, p 25 Using this as well as the Nanda's lowness of birth to drum up popular support of their rebellion, Chanakya and Chandragupta began to broaden their anti-Nanda coalition among the freedom-loving clans and princes of Punjab and Sindh, most of whom had given stout resistance to the foreign invader Alexander, they find the military support they had been seeking, this time with the help of the chieftain Parvataka and his brother Vairodhaka.Bhargava 1996, pp 37-38 The game speculates that the battle took place near a military camp, and provides a model of an ancient Indian military camp on the mapboard.Welch 2008, \\"Scenario Book\\" pp. 12-16 * Revolt of Malayaketu, ca 317 BC‚ÄîThis scenario is based on events from the play Mudrarakshasa, which, per Bhargava, was \\"probably based on events which actually occurred\\". Having won power with the help of independent tribes and principalities, Chandragupta promptly evades the pre-war promises he had made them. Betrayed, the tribal chieftains rise against Chandragupta. The revolt is led by the son of Parvataka, named Malayaketu, with the help of five other chiefs and an ex-minister of the Nanda regime named Rakshasa. Chanakya gets to work, employing \\"cunning\\" against the rebels, e.g. he has several of Malayaketu's allies poisoned and uses guile to sow dissension among the tribes.Bhargava 1996, p 39 The game uses the Indian military camp, as described by Kautilya in the Arthashastra,Kautilya, Arthashastra ref as the centerpiece of the scenario. The designers posit an attack by Chanakya upon the camp at night.Welch 2008, \\"Scenario Book\\" pp. 17-21 * Takshashila, ca 316 BC‚ÄîAfter overthrowing the Nandas, Chandragupta had to justify his new dynasty by proving it able to secure the protection of the people against foreign invasion by the Greeks.Sastri 1988, p 148 Takshashila (aka \\"Taxila\\" in Greek) was at the time under the joint rule of the Indian king Ambhi, who had allied himself years earlier with Alexander against his rival king Puru (\\"Porus\\" of Hydaspes fame), and the Thracian general Eudemus, a successor of Philip. When Eudamus treacherously has Puru murdered, a native revolt begins. Chandragupta transforms the revolt into an organized military action against Takshashila. Eudamus is not committed to this battle ‚Äì his joint rule with Ambhi was meant to be temporary, but his permanent appointment as satrap was never made. He quits India to later help Eumenes in his fight against Antipater, and the remaining Greek officers remaining are put to the sword.Sastri 1988, pp 149-50 The battle takes place in the valley of the Tamra Nala river, bounded by rugged hills overlooking Takshashila from the east. The centerpiece of the terrain is the city itself ‚Äì the walled city, with four gated entrances, surrounding dense city blocks of congested dwellings. In the center of the city is its temple and palace. The game map is based upon topographical maps drawn by archaeologist J. M. Marshall's A Guide to Taxila.Welch 2008, \\"Scenario Book\\" pp. 22-27 * Gandhara, 304 BC‚ÄîAccording to Grainger, after his stalemate with Antigonus in 308, Seleucus conquers Bactria and then proceeds to Gandhara on India's western frontier. Marching through Oxyartes' satrapy of Paropamisadae and then down the Kabul River, he crosses at the confluence of the Indus somewhere in the vicinity of modern Attock in Pakistan. On the east bank of the Indus Chandragupta confronts him. With his back to the river, Seleucus fought to what was possibly a tactical draw, but it was a strategic loss. Having gambled so far from home but failing to achieve a victory, Seleucus is \\"gifted\\" 500 war elephants from the Mauryan emperor in exchange for the surrender of his possessions in the Indus valley, Arachosia, and Gedrosia.Strabo, 15.2.1(9) Sources suggest that the cession of these territories were treated as the dower of Seleucus' daughter in her marriage to Chandragupta's son, Bindusara.Sastri 1988, p 154 The game deploys Seleucus squeezed close to the sands and mud of the Indus River at his back, leaving him with little room to maneuver.Welch 2008, \\"Scenario Book\\" pp. 28-31 * Revolt in the Provinces, ca 275 BC‚ÄîFrom the Buddhist narratives Divyavadana, it is related that Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka, while proconsul of Takshashila, was commissioned by his father Bindusara with the task of restoring order during a popular revolt against \\"wicked officials\\" (i.e. high- handed oppression by local ministers). The \\"official\\" history takes pains to reassure that the people were not opposed to the \\"Kumara [prince] or even king Bindusara.\\"Sastri 1988, p 167 The designer of Chandragupta (the game) opted to design the scenario with the premise speculating that the aging Chanakya, as viceroy of Takshashila, is faced with an uprising by the city's merchant class. Chanakya's forces occupy a portion of the city; the \\"rebel\\" forces ‚Äì a coalition of Sreni ‚Äì occupy part of the city, and its gates and the roads leading to it. Ashoka, with a force of Maula, must rescue the beleaguered Chanakya.Welch 2008, \\"Scenario Book\\" pp. 32-35 * Suppression of the Khashas ca 274 BC‚ÄîThough he was hailed as \\"Slayer of Enemies,\\" Chandragupta's son Bindusara was friendly with the Hellenic world and was known to have had a taste for Greek figs, wine, and philosophy. Little is known, however, about the military conquests of Bindusara. He is generally thought to have consolidated (if not expanded) his father's empire, but from the chronicles of Taranatha, we are told that Bindusara \\"destroyed kings and nobles of about sixteen cities\\" in the rebellious Khasa rajya, or realm of the Khashas. The Khashas, whose settlements in the former kingdom of Puru extended from Jhelum to the west of Kashmir, were likely independent principalities united by clan or tribal connections who chafed at Mauryan imperial power.Sastri 1988, pp 167-68 The game sets the hypothetical battles among tribal strongholds on rugged mountain terrain. According to Sastri the Khashas' strongholds were West of the Jhelum (\\"Hydaspes\\") River, though the historical locations of these battles are not known. We have opted to \\"condense\\" what was probably a series of scattered revolt suppressions into two scenarios.Welch 2008, \\"Scenario Book\\" pp. 36-41 * Battle of Kalinga, 261 BC‚ÄîAshoka was the proconsul of Takshashila prior to his ascension to the throne, which he seized ‚Äì as legend has it ‚Äì as outcome of a fratricidal struggle that he waged after his father became ill.Sastri 1988, pp 167-69 There is no clear evidence, but some scholars suggest that Ashoka is the son of Bindusara and the Greek princess Helen, daughter of Seleucus.Sastri 1988, pp 208-209 Chandragupta and Chanakya had been hostile to non-monarchial states. Many such states, quasi-democratic oligarchies as well as republics, had been weakened by the wars with Alexander, and that weakness made possible the eventual hegemony of the Mauryan Empire. Thus, the Mauryans had always kept a wary eye on Kalinga.Sastri 1988, pp 172-73 A large and fiercely independent sa≈Ügha (republic), Kalinga had been originally conquered by Ugrasena Nanda, but regained its independence during the rule of Sahalya, and remained so until the reign of Ashoka Maurya.Das 1986, pp 31-32 Eight years after his anointment, Ashoka marched on Kalinga. On a battlefield near the village of Dhauli the Kalingan army was defeated. Records affirm that 100 thousand were slain, 150 thousand were deported (enslaved), and many times that number died thereafter. It is said that the river Daya nearby ran red with the blood of the slain.Sastri 1988, p 210 After the battle Ashoka ascended the hillocks to survey the field he had won; at twilight he saw heaps of dismembered bodies of soldiers and animals, heard the cries of wounded, witnessed the anguish of women searching the dead for their husbands and sons. As the story is told, the slaughter filled Ashoka with such anguish he changed from Chandashoka (\\"Ashoka the Terrible\\") to Dharmashoka (\\"Ashoka the Pious\\"), and converted to Buddhism.Sastri 1988, pp 211-12 For this scenario, the game uses two mapboards as the scene of a large set-piece battle. The terrain represented is based upon topographical maps of the area near Dhauli Hill, the historical battle site and now a Buddhist shrine.Welch 2008, \\"Scenario Book\\" pp. 42-46 Expansions An expansion was printed in C3i Magazine, published by RBM Publications (Rodger B. MacGowan, Editor & Publisher), which provided two \\"alternative history\\" scenarios.Welch 2009, pp 40-43 The first, \\"Ganges River,\\" speculates a battle between the army of Alexander the Great and the Nandan army at the banks of the Ganges River (which did not happen historically due to the mutiny of Alexander's troops at the Beas River), and the second, \\"Magnesia,\\" a hypothetical show-down between the Mauryan army of Ashoka and the Roman Republic in Asia Minor.Welch 2009, Inserts to article, pp 40-43 See also * Tabletop game * Tactical wargame * GMT Games * Military History of India * Chandragupta Maurya * Ashoka * Bindusara * Chanakya * Maurya Empire * Seleucus I Nicator References Bey, Fr√©d√©ric, \\"Jouez Maurya contre Seleucides,\\" Vae Victis Magazine, No. 86, May 2009.

The company was active between 1951 and the 1970s. Early history Willard Ray Custer filed a United States patent in 1929 for a wing design incorporating a semi- circular channel or \\"half barrel\\" shape in which an engine was to be fitted in pusher mode. Custer claimed that this layout, the Custer Channel Wing, which gave STOL operating capabilities, resulted in a design \\"which is not an airplane. It does not plane the air to fly, rather it brings the air to the lift surfaces and reduces pressure to fly at 8 to 11 mph\\".Aerofiles The Custer CCW-1 The first aircraft to incorporate Custer's concept was the CCW-1 which was fitted with a single seat and powered by two 75 hp pusher engines. The sole example first flew on 12 November 1942. Custer's next aircraft was the CCW-2 which was an evolution of the CCW-1 as a single-seat test bed using the adapted fuselage of a Taylorcraft BC-12 light aircraft, replacing the original single engine with two pusher engines fitted each side of the fuselage and placed within wing channels. The sole example first flew on 3 July 1948 and made many test flights totaling about 100 hours. Formation of the corporation Custer continued to develop his ideas for the Channel Wing and in 1951 he formed the Custer Channel Wing Corporation with a registered address at 1905 West Washington Street, Hagerstown, Maryland. It was reported that Taylorcraft Inc of Conway, Pennsylvania were the first manufacturers to be licensed for the production of both military and private aircraft using the Channel Wing principles.Flight, 1952 Design development The first type to be produced on an experimental basis was to be a military aircraft to comply with United States Air Force specifications for a liaison aircraft. It was to carry a pilot and three fully equipped combat troops or 10 litter patients. Performance envisaged was 1,000 lb load, cruising at 150 knots or better over a five-hour cruise range.Flight, 1952 In the event, Taylorcraft did not put the plans into action. A design had been prepared by early 1952 for a single- engined channel wing aircraft with the engine fitted in a single channel immediately behind the crew cabin.Flight, 1952 This aircraft was not built. Design numbers CCW-3 and CCW-4 were not used. The second Custer CCW-5 Custer obtained some financial backing from various investors and proceeded with design of a larger five-person, twin-engined Custer CCW-5. The first example was built for Custer by the Baumann Corporation of Santa Barbara, California. It utilized an adapted fuselage and tail assembly of a Baumann Brigadier light twin-engined aircraft. Power was from two 225 hp engines and the CCW-5s first flight was made on 13 July 1953.Aerofiles The CCW-5 accommodated five persons and was claimed to be capable of flying at a sustained speed of 35 mph.Green, 1965, p.453 Custer persisted with his design and built a second CCW-5 at the CCWC factory, again using the fuselage and tail of a Baumann Brigadier. This aircraft first flew on 19 June 1964. Although several firms expressed interest in production of the design, all failed to provide sufficient funds.Aerofiles In 1965, Custer and the Custer Channel Wing corporation were convicted of contempt of court for continuing to sell shares of the company after a 1962 SEC injunction. The CCW-5 continued to make development flights during the 1960s and 1970s, but no production orders were obtained. In 1978 Custer filed an $80 million suit against the designers of the A-10 for using his idea of induced lift from the proximity of the engines to the wings. The suit was dismissed.

World Without Oil Our world is seriously dependent on oil, but humans are using it up so quickly to the point that it may eventually run out one day, and the Earth will not have enough time to replenish it. It will happen within a timescale between twenty years to a century, but what if all the oil ran out today? In the first few minutes, approximately of under-ground oil vanishes. Alarms in oil rigs sound as pipe pressure plummets. One day after oil, asphalt, diesel, petrol, and tar supplies become limited. This causes $US2 trillion of stock to become worthless. Oil-workers are sacked. Consumers rush to petrol stations to fill their cars up for the last time. Oil tankers are called back to their countries of origin to save national reserves of oil. Every mode of international transport is now grounded. However, steel, food, medical supplies, and trash are not being moved. Power-stations start running out of diesel. Power cuts start spreading across the world. Five days after oil, martial law is declared to stop rioting and looting. Unemployment rises to 30%. Farm animals die due to lack of food. Coal power stations face shortages of coal. Thirty days after oil, passenger trains are running on oil rations and the roads are empty of cars. Governments decide to start a program of biofuel planting. Five months after oil, Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford are taken over by the American government. Famine and drug-resistant infections threatens death and migration as food shipments come every second day. Emergency vehicles are still getting oil rations. This inspires citizens to experiment with chemicals to produce their own biofuel. Governments start to wonder if they should plant crops for food or fuel. They later abandon biofuel planting altogether. One year after oil, emergency vehicles start to be run either by lithium battery or biofuel. The price of lithium then shoots up. Populations of wild animals bounce quickly back. People resort to growing their own food, keeping livestock and hunting. Ten years after oil, artificial satellites burn up in the atmosphere as parts are not being replaced. Electronic equipment is scavenged for precious metals as people start recycling on a huge scale. Algae is used as a bio-fuel. Trucks deliver supplies to hospitals. Forty years after oil, skies are much clearer and cleaner as pollutants are washed out. Aeroplanes, trains, and ships now run on biofuel. Lithium battery cars are expensive. People only grow and farm what they need. New towns grow along railway points. A world trade based on biofuel and lithium is now growing. Eventually, lithium supplies may begin to run out, but balancing this with biofuel production means that humanity is able to prosper once again.History.ca National Geographic Population Overload Overnight, the population of the earth doubles, from about 7 billion to nearly 14 billion.History.ca National Geographic The governments of the world attempt to cope at first by ordering the construction of gigantic high rise apartment complexes. However, the often outdated public works systems cannot handle this vastly increased load - bridges break and sewers fail, leading to contamination of the water supply. Much of the remaining woodlands of the earth are cleared to form new farms and housing. In the meantime, emergency rationing becomes commonplace. Rationing of water and food becomes common, and countries who formerly exported grain stop the exports, leading to a drastic shortage. Even in wealthy countries, food and water resources are becoming strained as countries struggle to support the doubled population. Electrical power grids have difficulty keeping up with the increased demand. New coal plants are built to relieve the pressure, but they result in worldwide air pollution. Water shortage becomes the primary problem, with not enough water available for drinking or farming. Looting becomes a problem, and martial law is declared in many places. Desalination plants are built to deal with the water shortage. People in countries that lack water and food begin leaving the country in search of resources, prompting an unprecedented human migration. Many people head to the Great Lakes, forming massive tent cities. A population crash begins, resulting in the die-off of billions of people due to the carrying capacity being exceeded. Thirty years after the doubling event, the population crash concludes. The total human population stabilises at 4 billion, leaving humanity at a similar number to as it was in the mid-1970's. When the Earth Stops Spinning This scenario is unique because it doesn't happen overnight, but instead over a given period of time: The Earth revolves at 1,000 miles an hour but is gradually slowing down, yet this slowing is too slow to be noticed on human timescales. But what if it significantly slowed and eventually stopped? (The reason for this is because if the Earth stopped spinning instantly, everything on its surface, including buildings and trees, would be blown away eastward across the planet by winds over thousands of miles per hour, which would kill every living thing on the surface in the process) The spin of the Earth starts slowing down dramatically. In this scenario, Earth would stop spinning in as little as five years. The first effect is the isolation between the Global Positioning System satellites and ground-based atomic clocks. Then stock markets crash because of uncertainty about humanity's future. As time goes on, the oceanic bulge of water at the equator moves northward and southward. The water floods Russia, Canada, Antarctica, and Northern Europe. The atmosphere, once shaking solar heat out over the world and shifting air, stops, and whirls to the poles. The atmosphere starts to thin at the equator, and people have to migrate to more northerly and southerly cities to keep up with denser air. There is a higher risk of solar radiation as the magnetosphere weakens because of the slowing inner core. As the Earth slows, the crust, mantle, and the molten core slow down at different a speed. The massive friction from reduced rotational speed creates tremendous earthquakes where there have never been earthquakes before. Humans and other animals start suffering from sleep fatigue as their bodies cannot properly work in a day longer than 60 hours. The new oceans at the poles start inundating the Contiguous United States and Mediterranean Europe around this time. As the ocean water has moved to the poles, the sea recedes from around the equator, revealing new a new gigantic landmass which spans the entire planet's midsection. Canada, Russia, Antarctica, and most of Europe are underwater. Eventually, the Earth stops spinning altogether. The scorching light of day lasts for six months, while the remaining six months of the year are ice-bound darkness of night. The planetary landscape now consists of one ocean approximately 10 miles deep in the north, one in the south, and a girdle of land around the equator. Most of the new continent is uninhabitable due to thin air, but the former ocean floor has sufficient air pressure for human life. A team of scientists sets sail for the new continent, but harsh storms near the equator wreck their boat and wash the survivors ashore, where they face an uncertain future. Survivors living in places such as Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma are safe from flooding and have sufficient air pressure to sustain human habitability. But in the new stable climate of the still Earth, little to no precipitation occurs, dooming the survivors‚Äî even worse, because the electricity supply has collapsed due to the flooding, the survivors are unable to desalinate the oceans for water for several years. Although the inhabitants of the Midwest face a perilous outlook from there on, the possibility of finding food remains as large numbers of sea fish live on in the drowned landscapes beyond. Survivors living in Hawaii, now part of the new equatorial supercontinent, are better off than survivors residing in Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma because the colony is about 1000 miles north from the edge of the Sun's path. Survivors living there can get sufficient amounts of water from rain to last the year. They would be able to fish without having to break through the ice and put their lives at risk. Red Giant Swallowed by the SunHistory.ca National Geographic Life on Earth is dependent on the Sun's light and heat in order to survive, but our Sun won't live forever and eventually it will die one day. However, the Sun's death will not happen for billions of years. But what if the Sun started aging rapidly at an accelerated rate? The sun gradually becomes hotter as the hydrogen at its core is consumed through nuclear fusion, resulting in the accumulation of helium, which causes the remaining hydrogen to fuse faster to maintain radiation pressure against the sun's gravity. The average global temperature goes up by 36 ¬∞F (20 ¬∞C). In Greenland and Antarctica, snow and ice would begin to melt, causing sea levels around the world to rise by more than , submerging coastal cities. Regular temperatures this hot, around , are hard for us to handle. If our body temperature increases by 6 ¬∞F to 7 ¬∞F (3-4 ¬∞C) for an extended period of time, we can suffer permanent injury or death. At , we can't survive on the surface. The heat, hot enough to boil water, would blind and suffocate humans and animals as the alveoli in their lungs are cooked. The magnetosphere, an invisible field circling our planet that protects us from solar subatomic particles, would begin to weaken. Animals without lungs, including hardy creatures like cockroaches, survive longer, but eventually also succumb to the heat. The only place humans could survive is underground, and to explore the Earth's surface, humans have to wear spacesuits. At , water would begin to evaporate much faster than it does today. The concentration of water vapor increases in the atmosphere, displacing oxygen, but despite the intense heat, oxygen levels become so low that fires can't start. Rain evaporates before reaching the ground. At , all human life on Earth is rendered extinct. Even humans living underground are eventually killed by the intense heat as eventually they reach the point where the planet's own internal heat from the mantle prevents burrowing deeper to escape the rising temperatures. Every last drop of water evaporates, turning the former ocean floors into salt pans. The air pressure resulting from the vaporized oceans would increase to 4000 pounds per square inch (almost three times that of Venus), destroying even pressurized containers. Anything made of plastic or other synthetic materials melt. Concrete deteriorates as the water inside it evaporates explosively, resulting in collapsing buildings quite literally turning into dust. Oxygen levels shoot back up after the water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen due to the sun's increased ultraviolet radiation, and the lighter hydrogen escapes to space. The planet would start turning red as the iron in Earth's crust begins to rust. The return of oxygen also causes spontaneous combustion to consume anything flammable which remains. At , stone structures such as Stonehenge and the Egyptian Pyramids melt down, destroying the last human constructs. Earth's crust itself melts as well. The sun eventually enters its red giant phase after last of its hydrogen is consumed, and temperatures at its core reach the point where the helium begins to fuse. As it does so, the planets Mercury and Venus are destroyed as its radius increases to reach their orbits in succession. As the sun continues to expand, its massive outer edges begin to slow the Earth's orbit. The wreckage of the planet, now molten magma, would spiral inward towards the sun and be incinerated. Eventually the dying star stops expanding before it reaches the orbit of Mars, the sole survivor of the inner planets, now the only rocky planet in the entire solar system.

Although it is called selenium monochloride, a more descriptive name might be diselenium dichloride. It is a reddish-brown, oily liquid that hydrolyses slowly. It exists in chemical equilibrium with SeCl2, SeCl4, chlorine, and elemental selenium. Selenium monochloride is mainly used as a reagent for the synthesis of Se-containing compounds. Structure and properties Selenium monochloride has the connectivity Cl-Se-Se-Cl. With a nonplanar structure, it has C2 molecular symmetry, similar to hydrogen peroxide and sulfur monochloride. The Se-Se bond length is 2.23 √Ö, and the Se-Cl bond lengths are 2.20 √Ö. The dihedral angle is 87¬∞. Preparation Selenium monochloride was originally produced by the chlorination of selenium. An improved method involves the reaction of a mixture of selenium, selenium dioxide, and hydrochloric acid:Feh√©r, F. \\"Diselenium Dichloride\\".

A second method for the synthesis involves the reaction of selenium with oleum and hydrochloric acid: :2 Se + 2 SO3 \\\\+ 3 HCl ‚Üí Se2Cl2 \\\\+ H2SO3 \\\\+ SO2(OH)Cl The crude selenium monochloride product is collected via distillation. In acetonitrile solutions, it exists in equilibrium with SeCl2 and SeCl4. Selenium dichloride degrades to the monochloride after a few minutes at room temperature: :3 SeCl2 ‚Üí Se2Cl2 \\\\+ SeCl4 Reactions Selenium monochloride is an electrophilic selenizing agent, and thus it reacts with simple alkenes to give bis(Œ≤-chloroalkyl)selenide and bis(chloroalkyl)selenium dichloride. It converts hydrazones of hindered ketones into the corresponding selenoketones, the structural analogs of ketones whereby the oxygen atom is replaced with a selenium atom. Finally, the compound has been used to introduce bridging selenium ligands between the metal atoms of some iron and chromium carbonyl complexes.

It is 3 miles from Tullow and has a notable bridge over the River Slaney. It also has a church,Church web-site and at one time had a school.Library Ireland History and mythology=Name Aghade (or √Åth Fh√°d in Irish, meaning \\"long ford\\") was historically, as the name indicates, a \\"ford\\" or crossing place of the river Slaney. In early times an important road or \\"pass\\" from Dublin to Wexford ran through Baltinglasss, Tullow and Enniscorthy. Book of Ballymote In \\"The Book of Ballymote\\" it is told how Eochaidh, the son of Enna Cennsealach, killed the poet Niall of the Nine Hostages. The High-King pursued him into Leinster, laid waste the province and forced the Leinstermen to surrender Eochaidh to him. He then carried off his prisoners to Ath Fadhat on the banks of the Slaney and there he left him with a chain around his neck secured to a stone. As Niall retreated northward, nine of his champions returned to put an end to Eochaidh. When the latter saw them coming the ‚Äòlegend‚Äô has it that he put forth all his strength, gave a sudden jerk by which he broke the chain and, seizing an iron bar to which it was secured, attacked and slew his champions. Encouraged by this feat the Leinstermen rallied, attacked Niall‚Äôs army, defeated it and pursued it as far as Tullow slaughtering the retreating troops all the way. In modern times, human bones and skeletons as well as mangled pieces of swords and other military equipment have been dug up from Aghade to Tullow. Christian origins of Aghade and All Saints In the fifth century Saint Iserninus, Saint Patrick‚Äôs nephew, resided in and was buried at Aghade. It is argued that Iserninus in close consultation with St. Patrick founded the church here. ‚ÄòThe Carlow O.S. Letters‚Äô states an abbey for nuns of the Order of St. Augustine was founded by Dermot McMorogh, King of Leinster, in 1151. He appointed it to be a sub abbey of the nunnery of St. Mary de Hoggis in Dublin. It appears that in the reign of Henry VI (1422 ‚Äì 1461) 60 acres of land in Ardristian as well as the rectory of Aghade belonged to this Abbey or rather to the head house of that order in Dublin city. The present day church occupies the same site of the former convent.

History=Formation (2006‚Äì2009) The band formed in the summer of 2006, playing their first gig to an audience of around 20 people. By their third show, they had replaced Abigail Williams on a tour slot as the main support act for Bring Me The Horizon and were playing to over 400 people. They were named as one of the best new English death metal bands, they have toured with the likes of Trigger the Bloodshed and Bleed From Within, and recorded a 6-track EP. Two years later, the band signed a worldwide recording contract with extreme metal label Earache Records. They recorded a debut album, Of Winter Born, at Grindstone Studios in Suffolk in September 2008 with producer Scott Atkins (Sylosis, Gama Bomb). Ignominious Incarceration toured, supporting Bring Me The Horizon, Deez Nuts & The Red Shore on the European leg of their tour. In the UK, they played with bands The Argent Dawn and The Eyes of a Traitor. They also toured the UK and Europe with bands Beneath The Massacre and Cryptopsy. Of Winter Born and name change Of Winter Born was released by Earache Records on 10 March 2009. A limited edition version included a bonus disc with four additional tracks. Of Winter Born has been described as \\"...relentless in nature\\" by Kerrang! magazine; \\"...an overpowering barrage of old school riffs\\" by Terrorizer; \\"...a striking, technically superb brutally memorable debut\\" by Rock Sound; and \\"...a taut and satisfying riff-storm that finds its melodic roots\\" by Revolver. According to Metal Hammer magazine, the band had \\"...already found the right balance of technique, melody and brutality. While many young metal bands rehash clich√©s and old school encumbrances, this lot are threatening to be something altogether different and more demanding.\\" On 23 September 2010, Ignominious Incarceration announced their band's name being changed to The Soulless. The group commented, \\"We wanted a new name which was easy to remember and say... the name has a dark, edgy feel to it, but is not instantly recognisable as metal and it's easy to say! We feel this represents us a lot better, as well as our new music.\\"Ignominious Incarceration Changes Name to The Soulless, Blabbermouth.net. 2010-09-23. Retrieved on 2010-10-01.

The Foundation for Psychocultural Research (The FPR) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles that supports and advances interdisciplinary and integrative research and training on interactions of culture, neuroscience, psychiatry, and psychology, with an emphasis on cultural processes as central. The primary objective is to help articulate and support the creation of transformative paradigms that address issues of fundamental clinical and social concern. History The FPR was founded in December 1999 with a gift from Robert Lemelson,http://www.aaanet.org/sections/SPA//lemelson.htm a documentary filmmaker and psychological anthropologist on the faculty of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The FPR supports research and other scholarly activities that encourage integrative approaches by bringing together experts from the neurosciences, psychology, psychiatry, and anthropology. Programs (2001‚Äì2016) Participants in the FPR‚Äôs inaugural interdisciplinary workshop at Ojai in June 2001 advocated research strategies that recognize and integrate multiple levels of analysis ‚Äì from biological processes like postpartum olfactory learning, to psychological concepts like attachment, to social, cultural, economic, and political conditions affecting mother-infant interactions ‚Äì and provide a better understanding of culture and context, including local variations in environments, behaviors, beliefs, and experiences. The FPR was a key supporter of the FPR-UCLA Center for Culture, Brain, and Development (CBD) and the FPR-Hampshire College Program in Culture, Brain, and Development. The FPR CBD programs were designed to foster integrative, cross-disciplinary research that focuses on how culture and context interact with brain development. In 2009 the FPR created a program for Culture, Brain, Development, and Mental Health (CBDMH). The primary objective of CBDMH, which was co-directed by psychological anthropologist Doug Hollan of UCLA and cultural psychologist Steve L√≥pez of USC, was to establish a strong program in cultural psychiatry, with an emphasis on integrating neuroscience and social science perspectives. The research initiative was based around ongoing, sustainable field sites and programs in various locations across the globe. A training component was embedded within each of the ongoing research projects. Workshops and conferences Through a series of planning workshops and conferences, the FPR continues to bring together scholars, researchers, and clinicians with overlapping interests to think across disciplinary boundaries in order to address social and clinical issues. To date, the FPR has hosted six international, interdisciplinary conferences at UCLA: (1) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Biological, Clinical, and Cultural Approaches to Trauma's Effects (13‚Äì15 December 2002; (2) Four Dimensions of Childhood: Brain, Mind, Culture, and Time (11‚Äì13 February 2005); (3) Seven Dimensions of Emotion (30 March‚Äì01 April 2007); (4) Cultural and Biological Contexts of Psychiatric Disorder: Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment (22‚Äì24 January 2010); (5) Culture, Mind, and Brain: Emerging Concepts, Methods, and Applications 19‚Äì20 October 2012); and (6) A Critical Moment: Sex/Gender Research at the Intersections of Culture, Brain, and Behavior (23‚Äì24 October 2015). Participants from these meetings have contributed papers to three published volumes linking several fields, including developmental psychobiology, cultural and biological anthropology, the study of psychological trauma, transcultural psychiatry, and social neuroscience: (1) Understanding Trauma: Integrating Biological, Clinical, and Cultural Perspectives (Cambridge University Press, 2007), edited by cultural psychiatrist Laurence Kirmayer (McGill University), Robert Lemelson, and physician/neuroscientist Mark Barad (UCLA); (2) Formative Experiences: The Interaction of Caregiving, Culture, and Developmental Psychobiology (Cambridge University Press, 2010), edited by biocultural anthropologist Carol M. Worthman (Emory University), developmental psychobiologist Paul M. Plotsky (Emory University), child psychiatrist Daniel Schechter (Universit√© de Gen√®ve), and FPR project director Constance A. Cummings; and (3) Re-Visioning Psychiatry: Cultural Phenomenology, Critical Neuroscience, and Global Mental Health (Cambridge University Press, 2015), edited by Laurence Kirmayer (McGill University), Robert Lemelson, and Constance A. Cummings Current activities The FPR is currently focusing on Culture, Mind, and Brain (CMB) research. CMB is an integrative approach to understanding human evolution, cognition, emotion, self, agency, ritual, religion, and other concepts that are not confined to any one scientific discipline. Crucially, advances in one discipline can redefine work in others, compelling researchers to bridge disciplines with new models that depict interactions between brain, mind, development, the social world, and cultural diversity.

Having joined Bury on loan on 25 March 2010 until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, he made his debut on 27 March in a Football League match against Aldershot, going on to make 9 appearances for the club, before being sent-off in the last league match of the season. Hartlepool On 13 October Poole joined Hartlepool United on a one-month loan deal, which was later extended by a month. Poole made 6 appearances at Hartlepool, scoring his first goal in senior football in the League 1 game against Brighton & Hove Albion. In December 2010, Poole returned to his parent club, Manchester City. On 13 May 2011, Poole made a permanent move to Hartlepool for the 2011/12 season, signing a two-year contract. He stated in the Hartlepool Mail newspaper that he wanted to sign even more when he saw experienced midfielder Nolberto Solano was signing on the same day. He scored a wonder goal on his first permanent game for Hartlepool away to MK Dons in a 2‚Äì2 draw. James scored two goals in his fifth league game against Rochdale which saw him score a 20-yard volley in a 3‚Äì1 win to give Hartlepool their first win of the season after four consecutive draws. After a few appearances on the bench, Poole returned to the Hartlepool United team and scored 2 away to Chesterfield.

Early life  O'Connell was born on 21 December 1887 in Ballina, County Mayo, to Jeremiah Ambrose and Winifred O'Connell. He was nicknamed \\"Ginger\\" because of his red hair. His father was a national school inspector, so the family lived in Sligo, Derry, Longford and Belfast, and Ginger attended a succession of primary schools. He studied in University College Dublin where he received a BA and a first class MA. He was a member of the Literary and Historical Society, and had an interest in boxing.. Copy at UCD website He was living in Cavan with his father, his sister Mary Margaret, his brother John Aloysius and two servants, Mary Burke and Rose Anne O'Reilly, at the time of the 1911 census, when he was 23. He was working as a Solicitor's Apprentice, could read and write as well as speak both English and Irish, and was single. His mother was not living as it is recorded that his father was a widower.  Irish Volunteers  O'Connell spent some time in the U.S. Army, serving with the 69th Infantry Regiment (New York) between 1912 and 1914. He returned to Ireland in 1914 and joined the Irish Volunteers, becoming Chief of Inspection in 1915. He travelled the country organising volunteer corps, as well as contributing to the Irish Volunteer's journal and delivering lectures on military tactics to both the Volunteers and Fianna √âireann. He also delivered a series of lectures about the famous Irish battles to the Gaelic League in Dublin. He was not a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood as he believed that soldiers should not be a part of secret societies. At the time the 1916 Easter Rising, O'Connell was operating in Dublin under instruction from Joseph Plunkett.www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie WS Ref #: 751 , Witness: Colm O'Lochlainn, Captain IV, Dublin, 1916; Printer and Publisher He was dispatched to Cork by Eoin MacNeill to try to prevent the Rising. Following the Rising, he was arrested and held in Frongoch internment camp from April to July 1916. In 1918 he was again arrested and interned, spending time in Wandsworth Prison with Arthur Griffith for the alleged involvement in the fabricated German Plot.WS Ref #: 637 , Witness: Muriel McSwiney, Widow of Terence McSwiney During the Irish War of Independence, he was a member of the Irish Republican Army headquarters staff, as Assistant Director of Training and, after the killing of Dick McKee, as Director of Training. He coordinated, and was the principal lecturer, for a training course for military officers. The course was run clandestinely in the premises of the Topographical Society on Gardiner Street in Dublin. A sympathetic doorkeeper allowed O'Connell's group in at night when the society was not present. Topics delivered by O'Connell included tactics, ordinance and engineering. Irish Defence Forces In the IRA split after D√°il √âireann ratified the Anglo-Irish Treaty, O'Connell took the pro- Treaty side. He was made Deputy Chief of Staff in the National Army. On 26 June 1922, he was kidnapped by anti-treaty forces in reprisal for the arrest of an anti-treaty officer; his kidnapping was a precipitating factor in the formal outbreak of the Irish Civil War, when government pro-treaty forces two days later attacked anti-treaty forces occupying the Four Courts. O'Connell survived the fighting and spent the rest of the civil war as General Officer Commanding the Curragh Command. Following the Civil War, the National Army was reorganised, and as part of that O‚ÄôConnell was demoted from general to colonel. He subsequently held a variety of positions: chief lecturer in the army school of instruction (1924‚Äì1929); director of no. 2 (intelligence) bureau (1929‚Äì1932); OC Equitation School (March‚ÄìJune 1932); quartermaster- general (1932‚Äì1935) and director of the military archives (1935‚Äì1944).

J. Plunket Protestantism In Ireland The Irish Times, when reporting his death, characterised Plunket as ‚Äòa Churchman of broad views ‚Ä¶ [who] was not afraid to utter his opinions‚Äô. Probably his most notable stand was in 1910 when, on the accession of King George V, parliament passed an act to delete terms offensive to Roman Catholics from the Royal Accession Declaration. The old Declaration, introduced in 1678, repudiated the Mass, transubstantiation and the invocation of the Virgin Mary and the saints. The modified form of the Declaration was widely opposed, but Plunket was the principal promoter of a petition to the House of Commons in support of it, signed by over 3,000 representative Irish Protestants. On another occasion, he was one of three Church of Ireland bishops who, with eighteen Catholic bishops, signed a controversial anti-partition manifesto issued before the Longford by-election of May 1917; the manifesto was a significant factor in Sinn F√©in's narrow victory in the by-election. Plunket was also an Irish language enthusiast, encouraging Irish in Church of Ireland schools and hymns in Irish at church services. In 1925, while still Bishop of Meath, he was severely criticised by W.B. Yeats in the latter's famous speech in the Senate on divorce. Plunket's uncompromising approach to sexual morality and the indissolubility of marriage had, as Yeats saw it, given succour to those intent on passing legislation which the Protestant minority would find oppressive. Shortly afterwards, he resigned as Bishop of Meath on health grounds when aged 55.https://blog.nli.ie/index.php/2011/10/19/bishop-plunket- yeats-and-jfk/ accessed 14Sept 2016 He was left the St. Anne's Park estate in Raheny in Dublin, formerly the residence of his uncle Lord Ardilaun, following the death of Lady Ardilaun, in 1937 due to the cost of the estate he sold it to Dublin Corporation, keeping Sybil Hill and 30 acres as his residence, his former residence is now St. Paul's College, Raheny.

Sphere science fiction London 1962 published the first full edition of the novel.  Synopsis  The book's introduction is written by a fictional editor and compiler working at a future time after 3000 AD, narrating the adventures of Joenes, a semi-legendary figure of the 21st century whose philosophy has permeated the world until a few years before the time of writing. From the introduction, the reader learns that this future civilization is dominated by Polynesians; that some great cataclysm overtook the world during Joenes' lifetime; that only fragmentary information of that time has survived, mostly by oral tradition carried on by story-tellers on various Pacific islands, being compiled and written down after a thousand years; and that the people of that future find it difficult to understand our time ‚Äì and while knowing that it possessed some technological achievements they don't have, they don't feel envious nor are they eager to re-discover these secrets. The bulk of the book consists of Joenes' adventures themselves. Born of parents of U.S. origin, Joenes has always lived on the tiny Pacific island of Manituatua. At 25 he loses his job and decides to visit the United States. Following his arrival there, he undergoes a series of surreal experiences, through which Sheckley describes with extreme sarcasm a society full of absurd extremes. Just arrived Joenes gets to know Lum, who would become his lifelong companion and friend, tries Peyote, argues with the police and is mistaken for a Communist. Investigated by a commission of inquiry he is sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, but his sentence is immediately remitted by some kind of an electronic oracle. He is co-opted as a professor in a university engaged in manifestly insane experiments and is later recruited by the government to work at the Octagon (which replaced The Pentagon). He is then sent to the Soviet Union on a secret mission but on his return the plane is mistaken for an enemy aircraft and attacked, sparking World War III. Only some Pacific islands survive, where Joenes moves with his friend Lum.

The liner was and was the first large civilian ship propelled by steam turbines. Victorian was in service for almost a quarter of a century, and was broken up in 1929. Background Canadian Pacific Steamship Company bought the Beaver Line in 1903 and entered the transatlantic trade. To compete, the Allan Line ordered two large new liners in October 1903. They were originally intended to be conventional twin-screw ships powered by reciprocating steam engines. The specification was changed to three-shafted vessels propelled by steam turbines in light of the great success of , a turbine-powered excursion vessel in service on the Firth of Clyde since 1901. Allan Line ordered engines similar to that of King Edward and from the same builder, the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company. Victorian became the first three-shaft ship and the first turbine liner in Atlantic service, and with sister ship became the first large turbine-powered commercial vessels of any kind, at a time when others doubted the wisdom of using the new technology in large ships. Design The engines in Victorian were a scaled-up version of King Edward's. Coal-fired Scotch marine boilers supplied steam at 180 psi (12.66 bar) to Parsons turbines. The smoke was exhausted through a large single stack. The high-pressure steam from the boilers was fed to a turbine directly driving the centre shaft; from the centre turbine steam was reused at a lower pressure in flanking turbines, each directly turning a wing shaft. Each shaft had a single screw. The ship was long, in beam and in depth, and measured . There were orlop decks fore and aft of the machinery spaces, and three full decks within the hull fitted to carry 240 second-class passengers on the main and upper deck and up to 940 in third class. Atop the hull, a forecastle was followed by forward holds, a long superstructure with passenger accommodations and public spaces for 470 first- class passengers on bridge and promenade decks, an after hold, and a poop deck. A combination cargo and passenger liner, Victorian could carry 8,000 tons of cargo and had refrigerated space for fruit and dairy products of Canada carried on the eastbound voyages. Performance The liner was designed for a service speed of and achieved on sea trials, with the turbines developing some 12,000 shaft horsepower and turning the directly coupled screws at 260 rpm. In 1905 the ship set an eastbound record of 5 days and 5 hours from Rimouski in Quebec to Moville in Ireland, which stood for some time. Career The ship as Marloch Victorians maiden voyage was in 1905, from Liverpool to St. John, New Brunswick. The ship was an immediate success, and after some adjustments to the machinery, settled into transatlantic service to Canada until August 1914. Following the outbreak of World War I the Admiralty requisitioned the ship on 17 August for conversion into an armed merchant cruiser and fitted eight 4.7-in (120 mm) guns which later were replaced by six 6-in (152 mm) guns. Victorian was commissioned into the Royal Navy and served with the 9th and 10th Cruiser Squadrons. Soon assigned to escort duty, the vessel also transported troops and cargo. In 1914, Victorian patrolled the Atlantic, and in September that year, in conjunction with the French cruiser Cassard carried out a sweep along the coast of Morocco in and carried out several bombardments to help suppress a rebellion. After Canadian Pacific took over Allan Line and the war ended, Victorian resumed civilian service in 1920. At the end of the following year the direct-drive turbines were replaced by geared turbines and oil fuel supplanted coal. The vessel became a single-class liner and was renamed Marloch. In the mid-1920s the liner was in reserve (although often used) until sold for breaking in 1929. References=NotesSources * * * * *Naval History.Net.

The Irish language is still in full vigour as the vernacular. Dun Chaochain cliffs The spectacular Dun Chaochain cliffs have featured in various walking guidebooks and walks during the summer periods are organised by Comhar D√∫n Chaoch√°in Teo in Carrowteige, the main village on the D√∫n Chaoch√°in peninsula. Benwee Head at 255m high is the crowning glory. Stags of Broadhaven The Stags of Broadhaven (a group of four precipitous rocky islets rising to almost 100m) are located about 2 km north of Benwee Head and are a site of ornithological importance. Walks The looped walk incorporates the Children of Lir Tir Saile sculpture. The well-known legend tells the tale of children who were turned into swans and condemned to wander the countryside for 900 years. The key feature of the loop is the black ditch ‚Äì a dry ditch which runs parallel to the coastline and clifftops and probably marked the boundaries of lands in previous times. The looped walks along the cliffs are marked with red, green and blue arrows according to the type of walk the individual or group wishes to follow.

The journal covers a broad spectrum of issues in HIV infection: education, treatment, prevention, research, clinical practice issues, advocacy, policy, and program development. Article categories The journal publishes editorials, featured articles, case studies, briefs, commentaries, media reviews, and letters to the editors. Abstracting and indexing The journal is abstracted and indexed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index Expanded, Family & Society Studies Worldwide, Health and Safety Science Abstracts, International Nursing Index, Pollution Abstracts, PsycLIT, PsychINFO, Psychological Abstracts, and Virology and AIDS Abstracts. According to the 2011 Journal Citation Reports, the journal has an impact factor of 1.09, ranking it 31 out of 97 journals in the Nursing category. History The inaugural issue was published in August 1989 by Medical World Business Press (Old Bridge, New Jersey). In 1991, NurseCom became the publisher and the journal was expanded to four issues per year. The founding editor was Jeanne Kalinoski, who served in that position from 1988 to 1996. She later recounted that she \\"had to face the awful fact that we had empty pockets, no publisher, no advertisers, and no manuscripts, let alone a system for peer review of those proposed articles.‚ÄùKalinoski, J.

As water mites of Africa, Asia, and South America have not been well-studied, the numbers are likely to be far greater. Other taxa of parasitengone mites include species with semi-aquatic habits, but only the Hydracarina are properly subaquatic. Water mites follow the general parasitengona life cycle, which is characterized by parasitic, calyptostatic, and predaceous stages. They are ubiquitous in nearly all freshwater habitats of every continent except Antarctica. Typical habitats include streams and marshes, but may also be found in more obscure areas such as treeholes, hot springs, deep lakes and waterfalls. Some species have also adapted to marine environments. Water mites are unusual among freshwater invertebrates in being colorful, with brilliant reds and oranges being most obvious, but they also display more subtle blues, greens and yellows. They are also unusual among all mites in that some lineages have movable, internalized eye lenses sunk deep within the tissues of the prosoma rather than being set on the surface of the cuticle. Parasitism= Background  Larvae are the only water mite life stage to have parasitic relationships with other organisms. Upon location of a host, larvae pierce host integument with their chelicerae and feed on hemolymph until fully engorged or brushed off. Common host groups include insects with aquatic or semi-aquatic juvenile stages, including, but not limited to, the Diptera (true flies), Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies). It was originally believed that water mite larvae located hosts by accidental contact, but recent studies have found they likely utilize a combination of visual, tactile, and chemical cues. Even though larvae are capable of sensing the presence of a nearby host, it has been suggested that they are unable to distinguish between host species, and rather select hosts solely based on spatial and temporal coincidence. The abundance of water mites in a region, as well as prevalence and intensity of host infection, are impacted by a multitude of environmental and biological factors, and have shown great geographic variation. In some cases, high infection intensities have significantly increased chances of host mortality and reduced fecundity. Water mite larvae have been considered as a potential biological control agents, although low natural infection intensities warrant supplementation with other control strategies in order to be effective.  Mosquitoes as hosts  The majority of water mites found parasitic on mosquitoes belong to two genera: Parathyas (Hydryphantidae) and Arrenurus (Arrenuridae). The biology and ecology of these specific host-mite interactions have been well studied, likely due to the significant relevance of mosquitoes to human health. Parathyas barbigera are among the most common mite species found parasitizing mosquitoes, especially those of the genera Aedes and Ochlerotatus. Their host range is likely much wider, as studies have detected P. barbigera parasitizing other dipteran families, such as Tipulidae (crane flies), Ptychopteridae (phantom crane flies), Chloropidae (grass flies), and Empididae (dagger flies). These mites are typically abundant along the margins of temporary ponds, springs, streams, and seepage areas in North America and Europe. Nymphs and adults can be seen crawling and mating along substrate beginning in early Spring, soon after the recession of surface ice. Eggs are laid soon after the thaw, and larvae typically emerge and begin host seeking within 30‚Äì40 days. According to Mullen (1977), P. barbigera attach exclusively to female mosquitoes as they land near the water's edge to oviposit, which was supported by an extensive field study in which he observed zero mite larvae on 15,000 Aedes pupae, and dissection of parasitized females revealed them all to be parous. Mullen hypothesized that this life history strategy increased chances of mite survival two-fold because those parasitizing males would likely die before returning to a suitable adult habitat. No literature was found discussing the impact of P. barbigera on mosquito physiology and survival. Cq. perturbans parasitized by A. danbyensis larvae Larval mites of the genus Arrenurus are also common ectoparasites of many mosquito species. In contrast to P. barbigera, Arrenurus mites are fully aquatic and prefer permanent habitats, such as swamps and marshes. Females lay eggs in protected areas hidden among the abundant vegetation of these habitats, and upon hatching, larvae can be found swimming throughout the upper water column in search of hosts.Mullen, G. R. (1974). The taxonomy and bionomics of aquatic mites (Acarina: Hydrachnellae) parasitic on mosquitoes in North America. Entomology. Once an immature host is located, Arrenurus larvae loosely bind to their integument, and monitor them until the adult emerges. Host muscle contractions just prior to emergence stimulate mite larvae to move towards the ecydisal opening and attach to the host along intersegmental sutures on their thorax and abdomen. Differences in preferred attachment site between mite species appear to be related to differences in host emergence behavior. Full larval engorgement takes approximately three days, during which they have the potential to significantly impact the health of their host. In laboratory settings, the survival of Anopheles crucians mosquitoes parasitized by Arrenurus (Meg.) pseudotenuicollis was found to decrease from 23.32 to 6.25 days between those harboring the least and greatest numbers of attached mites respectively. Under similar conditions, infection intensities equalling 17-32 mites decreased the number of eggs laid by gravid An. crucians by nearly 100%. High mite loads also significantly decreased the fecundity of field-collected An. crucians, but to a lesser extent than those infected in the lab. Similar consequences of high Arrenurus mite infection intensities were observed in other host-mite relationships. For example, Smith and McIver (1984) found that Arrenurus danbyensis loads of greater than 5 mites decreased the fecundity of Coquillettidia perturbans females by approximately 3.5 eggs per additional mite. Even though Arrenurus mite larvae have been considered as potential biocontrol agents, unrealistic numbers would need to be released in order to prove effective on their own.

Since 2013, he's been the host of Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX. Before that, he created and hosted the show State of the Re:Union, distributed by National Public Radio and PRX . Early life and career Letson was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, the son of a minister. At the age of twelve he moved with his family to Orange Park, Florida, a suburb of Jacksonville. As a teenager he became interested in recording and hip hop, spending much of his free time in the studio and participating in Jacksonville's music and arts scene. After graduating from Orange Park High School, he took a job as a flight attendant for American Airlines, allowing him to participate in poetry slams across the country.Bosworth, John (September 27, 2007). \\"npr‚Äôs american idol\\" . eujacksonville.com. Retrieved September 6, 2012. Performance poetry Letson became a heavy weight in the slam scene performing on stages across the country and on TV including Russell Simmon's Def Poetry Jam, and CBS's Final Four Pre-Game Show. In 2000 he won the Atlanta Grand Slam and placed third in the National Poetry Slam competition. Playwriting Letson subsequently shifted to playwriting and acting, and in 2001 he produced his first one-man show, Essential Personnel, for the local Jacksonville stage. The show earned him commissions for his work and performances across the country. In 2004 the Baltimore School for the Arts commissioned him to write Chalk, a \\"poetical\\" combining stage acting with poetry. Other plays include Griot and Julius X, a retelling of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar set in Harlem in 1965. His solo show Summer in Sanctuary opened Off-Broadway at the Abingdon Theatre Company in 2011 In 2007, Letson produced a short film which he released on the internet; this got him a call to audition for the Fox Network film-themed reality show On the Lot, though he was ultimately not selected. Public radio Al Letson and the crew of State of the ReUnion at the 74th Annual Peabody Awards In 2007 Letson discovered a radio competition called the Public Radio Talent Quest on a whim. The program, organized by the Public Radio Exchange (PRX) and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) announced the Public Radio Talent Quest, provided an open search for new public radio talent. The five-round competition started with more than 1,400 applicants and was voted on by fans, professionals and celebrity judges. Letson submitted a pilot for State of the Re:Union, and was chosen as one of three winners. From there, Letson's State of the Re:Union and Glynn Washington's Snap Judgement Radio were awarded funding by the CPB. The first season of State of the Re:Union aired in 2010 and the show continued for six seasons ending due to funding in 2015. State of the Re:Union won 3 consecutive Edward R. Murrow awards, 2 NABJ Awards, 3 NLGJA Awards, and a Peabody in 2015. In 2013 Letson hosted pilots of Reveal, a podcast/Public Radio Show from PRX and Center for Investigative Reporting. The first pilot of Reveal received a Peabody and went into full production in 2014. Letson went on to become the full-time host of the program which is currently heard on over 400 public radio stations. In 2016, Letson began hosting his own story Podcast, Errthang Show!  Comics  Letson credits comic books with teaching him how to read and helping him conquer dyslexia. He's worked on two independent comic books, Imperfect and Planetfall.

It was first introduced by Henri Theil and is based on the concept of information entropy. Definition Suppose we have samples of two discrete random variables, X and Y. By constructing the joint distribution, , from which we can calculate the conditional distributions, and , and calculating the various entropies, we can determine the degree of association between the two variables. The entropy of a single distribution is given as: : H(X)= -\\\\sum_x P_X(x) \\\\log P_X(x) , while the conditional entropy is given as: : H(XY) = -\\\\sum_{x,~y} P_{X,Y}(x,~y) \\\\log P_{XY}(xy) . The uncertainty coefficient or proficiency is defined as: : U(XY) = \\\\frac{H(X)-H(XY)}{H(X)} = \\\\frac{I(X;Y)}{H(X)} , and tells us: given Y, what fraction of the bits of X can we predict? In this case we can think of X as containing the total information, and of Y as allowing one to predict part of such information. The above expression makes clear that the uncertainty coefficient is a normalised mutual information I(X;Y). In particular, the uncertainty coefficient ranges in [0, 1] as I(X;Y) < H(X) and both I(X,Y) and H(X) are positive or null. Note that the value of U (but not H!) is independent of the base of the log since all logarithms are proportional. The uncertainty coefficient is useful for measuring the validity of a statistical classification algorithm and has the advantage over simpler accuracy measures such as precision and recall in that it is not affected by the relative fractions of the different classes, i.e., P(x) . It also has the unique property that it won't penalize an algorithm for predicting the wrong classes, so long as it does so consistently (i.e., it simply rearranges the classes). This is useful in evaluating clustering algorithms since cluster labels typically have no particular ordering. Variations The uncertainty coefficient is not symmetric with respect to the roles of X and Y. The roles can be reversed and a symmetrical measure thus defined as a weighted average between the two: : \\\\begin{align} U(X,~Y) & = \\\\frac{H(X)U(XY)+H(Y)U(YX)}{H(X)+H(Y)} [8pt] & = 2 \\\\left [\\\\frac{H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,~Y)}{H(X)+H(Y)} \\\\right ] . \\\\end{align} Although normally applied to discrete variables, the uncertainty coefficient can be extended to continuous variables using density estimation.

He had earlier been a rugby union international who represented England in the first international match in 1871, and was the brother of another rugby international, Francis Luscombe. Early life John Luscombe was born on 25 May 1848 in Forest Hill, then in Kent (subsequently subsumed into south London), England.Census Returns of England and Wales, 1851. Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK (TNA): Public Record Office (PRO), 1851 The family were at the time living at \\"The Grove\\" Church Road, Upper Norwood, London. His father, John Henry Luscombe (1797 to 1883), was a shipowner who had married late in life at the age of fifty to Clara Bristow (1823 to 1910), twenty-six years his junior. John, known as Harry in his family (his second name was Henry), had at least three siblings, a younger brother Francis (1849‚Äì1926), a younger brother, Alfred (1851‚Äì1942) and a younger sister Clara Elizabeth \\"Kitty\\" (1854‚Äì1900). He was initially educated at Mrs Pritchard's prep school near his home in Upper Norwood and from the age of seven was sent to Mr. Cousin's school on Anerly Road in Upper Norwood. With his family he had moved by the age of 13 to Hastings and by the age of 16 had embarked on a career on the oceans by joining \\"The Norwood\\", a ship under the command of his uncle Frank. Rugby union career 1871 England squad with Gipsies players JE Bentley (left) and JH Luscombe (right) highlighted A number of sources suggest that John and his brother Francis were the first brothers to appear together in a rugby international, in the very first international in 1871.Mathew Brown, Patrick Guthrie, and Greg Growden, Rugby for Dummies, Page 329, (For Dummies), ; Keith Quinn, The encyclopedia of world rugby, 1993, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC Enterprises) However, this is a misconception because Francis Luscombe did not play in that very first international, though his brother did.Dick Tyson, London's Oldest Rugby Clubs, p40 (JJG Publishing), 2008 He played his club rugby for Gipsies Football Club, a club founded in October 1868, by three Old Tonbridgians one of whom was his brother, Francis.Steve Lewis, One Among Equals, page 253, 2008 (Vertical Editions:London) These three men were keen on football and wanted to provide a football club in London with which Tonbridge's former pupils could affiliate, much as the Marlborough Nomads served Marlborough College. John had not attended Tonbridge, but played due to his family ties. His aptitude for the game was such that he was selected to play in the first international match, Scotland vs England in 1871. However, his career was severely limited by time spent at sea. As the eldest son in a family that owned considerable shipping interests he had certain expectations to pursue a career in that field. He subsequently became a marine underwriter. Career At the age of 22, having served on a number of vessels, he was elected a member of Lloyd's of London and started as underwriter. He was living in Lewisham at the time and played rugby regularly for his brother's side. His profession as a marine underwriter meant he spent much time at sea. By 1883 he had since moved to Bickley in what was Kent, and soon after to Worth, West Sussex. In 1902, after spending many years at sea in pursuit of his profession, he was appointed the chair of Lloyds, the first working man to be so. In the same year he was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours for services to underwriting, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year. He was chairman a total of five times. In addition to his professional commitments, he was also a Justice of the Peace, a member of Sussex County Council and in 1916 joined the directors of Prudential. In 1920 he was awarded the Gold Medal by Lloyd's of London.Lloyd's of London Press, Lloyd's nautical year book, p27, 1986 (Lloyd's of London Press) Personal life John Luscombe married Fanny Willcocks on 8 June 1876.

Prapiroon developed as a tropical depression on August 24, 2000, and took a primarily northerly course for much of its duration, though steering currents caused it to track westward for extended periods of time on two occasions. Intensification was gradual, and on August 26 the system reached tropical storm status, though the system's organization remained rather loose for much of its early developmental history. On August 29, Prapiroon swung near Taiwan and East China as it tracked about the western periphery of a nearby high-pressure area. A day later, the storm reached typhoon intensity within the East China Sea, later attaining peak intensity as a typhoon of moderate strength within the Yellow Sea. On August 31, a slightly weakened Prapiroon made landfall on North Korea and quickly tracked across the Korean Peninsula, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Japan on September 1; the system dissipated east of Hokkaido three days later. Meteorological history Prapiroon originated from a disturbance that developed within the warm tropics southeast of Guam on August 22\\\\. Positioned in an area with low wind shear, atmospheric conditions around the system were supportive of tropical cyclone development. After some organization, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the area of disturbed weather to have assumed the characteristics of a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on August 24. Initially tracking westward, the diffuse depression reached a temporary halt and later began to accelerate towards the north on August 25\\\\. Strengthening continued at a steady pace thereafter, and at 1800 UTC the following day, the JMA upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, based on corresponding ship reports and satellite intensity estimates, and named the system Prapiroon accordingly. Despite its classification, Prapiroon was loosely defined, as it lacked a primary circulation center and instead was centered around multiple vortices. In response to steering wind currents induced by a nearby, strengthening high- pressure area, Prapiroon began to take a more westerly course beginning late on August 27. Around the same time, the JMA upgraded the cyclone further to severe tropical status, a classification Prapiroon would maintain for much of its existence. Despite a consolidation of the previously distinct low-level circulation vortices, moderate wind shear displaced the newly merged center from much of its associated convection. However, the storm's overall structure would improve over the following days as Prapiroon began to curve northward around the western periphery of the nearby high pressure region. Late on August 29, Prapiroon made its closest approach to Taipei, Taiwan, at a distance of 260 km (160 mi). At around the same time, satellite imagery indicated the development of a large, albeit ragged eye. Having resumed a northerly course, the recent strengthening trend prompted the JMA to classify Prapiroon as a typhoon at 0600 UTC on August 30\\\\. Roughly six hours later, the typhoon peaked in strength, with maximum sustained winds reaching 130 km/h (80 mph) and a barometric pressure bottoming out at 965 mbar (hPa; 28.50 inHg). This intensity was held for at least the following 18 hours before Prapiroon's cloud structure began to elongate as the storm accelerated into more northerly latitudes, where wind shear was increased. Prapiroon was downgraded back to severe tropical storm intensity shortly before it made landfall on the western coast of North Korea at 1300 UTC on August 31. Although Prapiroon crossed the Korean Peninsula at a rapid pace, upon emerging into the Sea of Japan early on September 1, its interaction of land had caused the majority of its convection to deteriorate. At 1200 UTC that day, the JMA analyzed Prapiroon to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. These remnants tracked quickly eastward, crossing Japan on September 2 before dissipating in the open Pacific east of Hokkaido on September 4. Preparations and impact=Taiwan and China Sedimentation off the eastern coast of China caused by Typhoon Prapiroon The Taiwanese Central Weather Bureau issued warnings for ships in the vicinity of Taiwan's northern and eastern shores on August 28 as Prapiroon approached the island. Forecasts anticipated the tropical cyclone to track northeast of the island. Schools in Yilan and Keelung were temporarily closed on August 29 due to the storm. In Chongming Island near Shanghai, evacuation procedures were initiated, resulting in the displacement of approximately 3,000 people. Both Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek, which flowed nearby, were predicted to reach their second highest crests in recorded history as a result of the nearby Prapiroon. More than 100 flights departing or arriving at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport were either delayed or cancelled. Nearby ships were brought into temporary confinement in the Port of Shanghai. The outer rainbands of Prapiroon disrupted traffic and caused landslides in Taiwan, though effects were mostly of minimal extent. Storm surge associated with the typhoon coincided with the astronomical high tide along the coast of Mainland China, inundating large swaths of farmland and destroying thousands of homes. Floodwaters breached dykes in Shanghai's Baoshan and Chongming Island. Additional dyke breaching in several other districts in Shanghai forced the evacuation of 10,000 people. The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were the worst affected. In northern Jiangsu, four people were killed and 80 others were injured. The same region experienced severe flooding, resulting in the submerging of 364,000 hectares (899,000 acres) of farmland and the destruction of over 7,500 homes. In Xiangshui County, 821 mm (32.32 in) of rain was reported, setting a county record for most observed precipitation from a single rain event. The floods there prompted the evacuation of 13,800 people. The prefecture government in Yancheng allocated 400 soldiers and militiamen, along with 30,000 life jackets and various supplies, in order to combat the flood. Flood-relief channels in Shiliang Reservoir were opened in order to relieve the high water levels. In total, Prapiroon was responsible for the deaths of 10 people across China. Japan As a tropical storm, Prapiroon brought strong winds and rain to Okinawa Prefecture and the rest of the Ryukyu Islands. Precipitation totals peaked at 190 mm (7.48 in) in Ohara, though daily rainfall totals peaked at 94 mm (3.70 in) on Ishigaki Island. Due to the effects of the nearby tropical cyclone, several warnings were issued for the prefecture, and sea and air transportation was suspended. On Ishigaki, Prapiroon was particularly damaging to crops, including sugarcane, papaya, and banana. Around of farmland was reportedly damaged, and total costs of agricultural damage reached JP¬•25.8 million (US$240,000). In addition to crops, Prapiroon also caused adverse effects to several schools, including the shattering of several windows at a junior high school. More widespread and severe damage occurred in Okinawa's Miyako District, where damage to agriculture amounted to JP¬•105 million (US$990,000). Power outages were also widespread, impacting 400 households. Telecommunications were also disrupted as a result. Outside of its claims in the Ryukyu Islands, Japan remained largely unaffected by Prapiroon until the system passed over Honshu as an extratropical cyclone. Similar to its affects in the Ryukyu Islands, the storm mainly caused heavy rain, with rainfall totals peaking nationally in Nakagoya, Miyazaki Prefecture, where a station measured 253 mm (9.96 in) of precipitation. In Kyoto Prefecture, the rainfall resulted in the inundation of 39 buildings and the flooding of roads. K≈çchi Prefecture, located further northeast, experienced similar impacts, in addition to the occurrence of six landslides. Accrued damage amounted to JP¬•400 million (US$3.76 million). Strong waves off of Niigata Prefecture damaged 22 vessels and submerged coastal regions. Particularly impacted was Hokkaido, which was affected by high surf and heavy rains, delaying domestic flights and causing complications for rail service.

Background and early service Arms of Roger de Mortimer, Baron Mortimer of Chirk: Barry of six or and azure on a chief of the first two pallets between two gyrons of the second over all an inescutcheon ermine. Roger was the third son of Roger Mortimer, a powerful Marcher lord in the Welsh border territories, and Maud de Braose, Baroness Mortimer who was also an important Marcher landowner in her own right. The family were from the second rank of parvenu nobility elevated by the king as a reward for fierce loyalty to the Plantagenet dynasty. But he was said to be a lecherous and violent man.Weir, 10-14 He married Lucy de la Wafre, the daughter of Sir Robert la Wavre Lord of Hampton Wafer, Herefordshire, by whom he had one legitimate son, also named Roger.The History of the Foundation and Founders of Wigmore Priory[Dugdale, Monasticon Anglicanum, vol.6, part 1, p. 351 (Caley's edn, 1817-30)]. Presumably they were married by 8 June 1286, when Roger de Mortimer presented at the manor of Tedstone Wafer.Canterbury and York Society, vol. 6, p. 526 (1909); cf. John Duncumb, Collections towards the History and Antiquities of the County of Hereford, vol. 2, part 1, p. 263, which gives the date as 1285. In 1269, Gruffydd II, prince of Powys Fadog, died, and his lands were divided between his four sons. In 1277, the eldest son, Madog II, died; his two young brothers, Llywelyn and Owain, were still children, leaving them, and their lands, at the mercy of his eldest brother Gruffydd Fychan I. Mortimer was appointed by King Edward Longshanks to be the guardian of Owain and Llywelyn, but four years later their bodies washed up in the River Dee; Mortimer was accused of their murder. Mortimer, guilty or not, was granted their lands - the Cantref of Swydd y Waun. It is possible that Mortimer had needed the lands to raise his nephew, Roger, as his guardian.Mortimer, 14 In 1282, the ruling princes of Gwynedd attacked lands in the Perfeddwlad granted to King Edward under the treaty of Aberconwy. Consequently, the Welsh wars broke out, and Mortimer, a professional soldier, was a Captain in the victorious royal army. At some point, probably after 1295, he began work on Chirk Castle, possibly designed by James of St George, the architect of Beaumaris Castle, but the castle remained unfinished at the time of his death.Pettifer, p.60.. Mortimer fought at the Battle of Falkirk, in 1298, when William Wallace was finally defeated. On 6 February he was created Lord of Chirk.Welsh territorial lordships: Lord of Gower, Lord of Wigmore, and Lord of Chirk were created in the Welsh territories, and were only tied to England by vassalage, quite a different situation from English earldoms and baronies. The Mortimers supported the King's policy in Scotland and on the Marches. Chirk pledged allegiance to Edward II, and was with the young King when he went to negotiate his marriage with Isabella of France. They arrived at Dover on 19 January 1308, and Mortimer left Edward to cross the channel.Ian Mortimer, 34, n.7 On 22 May 1306, Mortimer was knighted at Westminster during Whitsuntide, thus his title made him of a suitable rank as an escort to the king.Prestwich, \\"Plantagenet England\\" - for the role of knights in medieval England. Parliamentary Roll of Arms calculated 1,150 knights in England for 1324. The Mortimers acquired huge estates taking ruthless control of Welsh strongholds. Roger was also granted the constableships of Blaenyllfori and Dinas in north Wales. Such was his power he was effectively a surrogate prince of Wales. Anticipating the nobles conflict with Piers Gaveston, Chirk avoided confrontation when the favourite was appointed Regent of England in the king's absence abroad. Feud with Griffith de la Pole Mortimer prepared to attack Griffith de la Pole (anglicized from the Welsh, Gruffydd).known as Gruffydd in welsh The Welshman was from the line of Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn, ruler of Powys throughout the thirteenth century. His heir had died as a Royal Ward, leaving only a daughter, Hawise, who was married to Thomas de Charlton.Thomas was John de Charlton's brother. Prestwich and Mortimer have differing views on the man who married into the baronial family. Griffith was her uncle, and under ancient Salic laws the inheritance was said to be shared amongst men only. Griffith attacked John de Charlton in Welshpool Castle aiming to recover his property; whilst the king ignored pleas for a legal settlement. Griffith sought the help of Thomas of Lancaster, recently married to the Lincoln heiress Alice de Lacy.de Lacy's family were kin of the de Geneville's, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March's wife's family. Chirk was ordered by the king to break the siege, but de la Pole refused royal arbitration. John de Cromwell, the Royal Steward, was sent to pacify Griffith, but he refused any help. Abandoned by Lancaster, Griffith found another supporter in the Earl of Arundel, a marcher lord. This act was treason. At last Chirk broke the castle's resistance and took Griffith prisoner. Lancaster seeing his allies wilting, had a furious row with Chirk at the subsequent Commission of Inquiry in Westminster. Lancaster swore the Mortimers everlasting enmity; the debacle causing the ultimate destruction of both Chirk and Lancaster. Gaveston's death only months later left the Mortimers defending their estates from the Lancastrians. Chirk's role at Bannockburn In March 1314 the King ordered Chirk to find 3,000 Welshmen for a Scottish campaign. They left the Marches on 27 May, and went north. The army mustered at Wark Castle, and then Berwick to converge on Stirling Castle. The larger force had set out from Berwick on 17 June, and reached Edinburgh three days later. That Saturday they left Edinburgh marching into the highlands towards Stirling. The next day, Sunday 23 June the lead knights spotted Stirling. One account says they were ambushed in New Park. During the fateful battle on Monday 24 June, Chirk was probably with King Edward's household guard. They rallied around the King amongst 500 knights when all seemed lost. Chirk may have been in the rearguard action led by the Earl of Pembroke, as King Edward fled into the castle. Chirk had been associated with the Royal Bodyguard since the siege of Caerlaverock in 1300. The heroic knights at Bannockburn, Sir Paine Tibetot, and Sir Giles d'Argentein were part of the same group. Ian Mortimer suggests that the Lord Chirk acted as an adviser to the Welsh archers.Mortimer, 60-64 York Parliament 1314 Mortimer, Chirk and their friends were in the ascendant at court, confirmed by Parliament at York in November 1314. Their association with Pembroke and Arundel identified the marcher lords with a 'middle party'. This was an attempt to make a genuine baronial party as an alternative to the Despensers hold over government. John de Charlton was made Chamberlain, and Archbishop of York William Melton became Keeper of the Wardrobe.A moderate, Melton oversaw a revolution in royal finances transferring more powers to the Exchequer, making taxation more accountable to the Commons. However the Mortimers made a powerful enemy in the Younger Despenser who vowed to avenge Mortimer's grandfather killing his grandfather at the Battle of Evesham, 1265. Revolt of Llewelyn Bren On 28 January 1316, the Sheriff of Glamorgan and his men holding court outside the walls of Caerphilly Castle were attacked by a gang of Welshmen led by Llewelyn Bren. He had declared war on the maladministration of Payn de Turberville, a new royal appointee. Years of faminePrestwich, Plantagenet England, 5-7 and punitive taxation led Llewelyn to desperate measures in defence of his people. The Earl of Hereford and the Mortimers were ordered to raise men to crush the rebellion. A royal army of 2,150 marched north from Bristol to relieve Caerphilly, and Llewelyn surrendered at the head of the valleys. Just prior to this event Chirk attended his nephew Edmund's wedding at Ernwood, near Kinlet, to Elizabeth Badlesmere, daughter of Lord Badlesmere.Badlesmere was a bad constable of Bristol causing the rebellion led by Sir John Tavener. As tenant of Leeds Castle, he was ousted by Queen Isabella, helping to divide king and barons It is possible that Chirk was present at the siege of Bristol on 26 July 1316. Justiciar of Wales Chirk Castle The disturbances in Wales caused the Lancastrians to have Chirk removed from office in January 1315. But when the Principality returned to peace, Chirk was re-appointed to post of Justiciar of North Wales in October 1316.Pettifer, p.60. By the 1320s, Chirk was the leading member of the family and in fierce competition with the Despensers, a rival Marcher family headed by Hugh Despenser the Elder and his son Hugh Despenser the Younger, the royal favourite and rumored lover of Edward II. They seized the lordship of Gower and many others in a brazen land grabbing war. The Despenser war With the Despensers in exile, Queen Isabella was eager to assist the King. She led an army with Earl of Arundel to besiege Baron Badlesmere, a crony of Lancaster's in Leeds Castle, Kent.Doherty, p.71. This was settled in October with the surrender of Badlesmere.Weir, p.135. On 8 December 1321, the King arrived in Cirencester. Moving up the Severn valley from Gloucester, he was joined by the recalled Despensers. They crossed the river at Shrewsbury. Seeing the situation was hopeless, the Mortimers surrendered in January 1322. Others like Roger Damory fled north to join Lancaster. Chirk and his nephew were sent to the Tower; their henchmen to Wallingford Castle. Ian Mortimer disagrees with Paul Doherty's thesis that Chirk was mortally wounded, suggesting that Chirk lived on another three years.Doherty, 86 Death Outnumbered, Roger Mortimer of Chirk and his nephew, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, later the lover and ally of Isabella of France, negotiated a surrender, thereby avoiding instant execution.Doherty, p.72. They were sent to the Tower of London where they were kept in poor conditions. Lord Chirk died in the Tower, apparently of injuries sustained during the war, on 3 August 1326.Pettifer, p.60. He was buried in St Augustine's Priory, Bristol.St Austin's or Augustine's is now the Cathedral His nephew, Roger Mortimer, managed to escape the Tower and fled to France, from where he ultimately joined Isabella in successful rebellion against Edward II in 1326. Roger Mortimer of Wigmore eventually completed Chirk Castle before his death in 1330.Pettifer, p.60. In fiction Roger Mortimer of Chirk is a supporting character in La Louve de France (The She-Wolf of France), a novel in Maurice Druon's series of French historical novels Les Rois maudits (The Accursed Kings). He was portrayed by Samson Fainsilber in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series. ReferencesBibliography * Doherty, Paul, Isabella and the Strange Death of Edward II.

History  The park was designed by the Olmsted Brothers, the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted. The park land was acquired in 1907 and construction finished in 1910. A driving force behind the building of the park was Franklin Murphy (governor) who wanted his workers at the Murphy Varnish Works to have open space. An expansion took place between 1926 and 1931. The baseball fields are on the former location of the Balbach Smelting & Refining Company, one of the largest metal processing companies in the country, which closed in the 1920s. In 1996, there was an attempt to build the Newark Bears, Bears & Eagles Riverfront Stadium at the site of the park, demolishing the park. SPARK (Save the Park At RiverbanK) is a community group formed to save the park from destruction. After an unsuccessful attempt to save the park via referendum, they were able to get the park on the National Historic Register.

Developing as a weak frontal wave on 8 January 1993, the system moved rapidly northeast. The combination of the absorption of a second low-pressure area to its southeast, a stronger than normal sea surface temperature differential along its path, and the presence of a strong jet stream aloft led to a rapid strengthening of the storm, with its central pressure falling to an estimated on 11 January.https://weather.com/news/international/news/2020-02-12-bomb-cyclone- dennis-rival-most-intense-north-atlantic-storms Its strength was well predicted by forecasters in the United Kingdom, and warnings were issued before the low initially developed. Gale-force winds covered the far northern Atlantic between Western Europe and Atlantic Canada, due to the intensity of this storm, with hurricane-force winds confined near its center of circulation. After reaching its peak intensity, the system weakened as it moved into the far northeast Atlantic, dissipating by 17 January. This storm caused severe blizzards across much of Scotland. It also led to the final breakup of the oil tanker MV Braer, from which the storm derived its name; it had been stranded in rocks off the Shetland Islands by a previous storm nearly a week beforehand. Meteorological history A weak frontal wave, a low- pressure system forming along a weather front with very strong temperature contrast, developed on the afternoon of 8 January to the southeast of Newfoundland with a central pressure of The system moved at a quick pace to the east-northeast at around , deepening slowly. As the storm tracked more northeasterly, development accelerated, and early on the morning of 9 January its central pressure had fallen to . A new low pressure area formed along the system's cold front to its south. By noon, the forward motion of the main cyclone accelerated to nearly and its central pressure began to bomb, then down to as it passed through the far northern Atlantic. This strengthening was enhanced by a strong jet stream with measured winds of , and a stronger than normal sea surface temperature gradient along its path from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland towards Iceland. The new low south of the main low strengthened quickly, and its central pressure dropped to . During the evening of 9 January, the main cyclone to the north continued to bomb out, with a central pressure down to . Soon afterwards, it absorbed the deepening low to its south and this merger caused a period of extreme intensification. By early morning of 10 January, the pressure at the strong cyclone's center had fallen to northwest of Great Britain as it slowed its northeast motion. Hurricane-force winds of were recorded at a weather ship just to its southeast. Towards sunrise, the center of the cyclone lay south-southeast of Iceland. The system continued to slow as it turned north-northeast, reaching its estimated lowest pressure of https://weather.com/news/international/news/2020-02-12-bomb- cyclone-dennis-rival-most-intense-north-atlantic-storms later that morning. Weather buoys in the region with identifiers of 44746 and 64043 were not designed to read pressures below , so when their pressures dropped to that reading, they stayed there until the storm moved away. Animation of the Braer Storm on 11 January The system's strongest winds were within of its center. Early during the afternoon of 10 January, a tremendous pressure differential existed between the center of the cyclone and a high-pressure area over Spain, which had a central pressure of . This caused an extensive area of gale-force winds which stretched from Newfoundland to Spain, and northeastward between Greenland and northern Norway. A large area of hurricane-force winds existed within this area of gales. The center of the low transcribed a loop before resuming a slow northeast motion into the far northeast Atlantic. However, the system began to weaken, and by the evening of January, 10 its central pressure had risen to . By the evening of 12 January, its central pressure rose to . During the evening of 13 January, its central pressure rose to while located in the far northeast Atlantic. Within four days, the low dissipated west of Norway. Preparations and impact The strength of this storm was well forecast by the British Met Office global weather forecast model as far as 84 hours in advance, which allowed forecasters in the United Kingdom to issue warnings related to the storm on the morning of 8 January, before the cyclone had initially developed. The sign of the North Atlantic oscillation switched from positive to weakly negative during the lifetime of this storm, which caused colder conditions to prevail in the Eastern United States and Western Europe by the time the system was dissipating. The British Isles saw their pressures fall as low as during the mid-afternoon of 11 January in Lerwick. Winds gusted to at two locations: the weather ship Cumulus and North Rona, north of Scotland. Wind gusts of over were measured across northwest Scotland. The highest precipitation amount recorded with this system across Great Britain was at Cilfynydd in South Wales. Periods of rain impacted the British Isles early in the morning of 10 January, progressing from west to east. Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during the day, with a wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain. Within the area of wintry mix, the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland. Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours. Thunderstorms were observed despite the near-freezing temperature readings. Wind and waves associated with this storm were too much for the tanker MV Braer, which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand. The tanker broke up and her remaining cargo of 84,500 tons of light crude oil spilled into the ocean surrounding the islands. The rough conditions caused by this storm led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks. Record set This cyclone was slightly stronger than an intense low pressure area which moved near Greenland on 14‚Äì15 December 1986, which was the strongest extratropical cyclone known to occur across the northern Atlantic Ocean at that time. Only three prior extratropical storms across the north Atlantic, and two since, have attained central pressures below .

The series was broadcast by ITV, and was billed as the return of the Survival brand. It was followed by Wild Britain with Ray Mears. Survival consists of three, hour-long, programmes, focusing on Mears' tracking of the world's top predators. He follows the leopard in Namibia, the bear in British Columbia, and the wolf in Central Idaho. An underpinning theme is the threats faced by each species: in Idaho the crew arrives with only days to countdown before the wolf's status as a protected species is lifted, and local farmers indicate their intention to begin hunting them; in British Columbia the impact of global warming on the salmon population is felt by the bear; and in Namibia the uneasy co-existence between leopards and local farmers is highlighted. Episode 1: Leopards In the first episode of Survival, Ray Mears arrives at the 270 square-mile Erindi Game Reserve in Namibia, a territory he describes as ‚Äòone of nature‚Äôs richest environments‚Äô. The reserve is surrounded by farmland, and leopards that stray onto them risk being shot by farmers anxious to protect their livestock. He aims to track his favorite predator: the leopard, an elusive big cat which Mears believes is ‚Äòhardly understood.‚Äô He is joined by his duo of wildlife camera men ‚Äì Isaac Babcock and Shane Moore, and Natasha De Woronin, who runs the Global Leopard Project. De Woronin needs Mear's tracking skills to help find male leopards, which have so far eluded her. They intend to fit the leopards with radio collars to help build a map of their movements across the reserve. Episode 2: Bears In the second episode of Survival, Mears travels to the wilderness of British Columbia‚Äôs Pacific Coast region. He aims to track grizzly and black bears, and especially the rare Kermode or Spirit bear, notable by its pure white fur. It is thought that there are only 400 alive today. Mears touches down at the fishing outpost of Klemtu, and hires a boat to the remote Mussel Inlet. He finds tracks of grizzly bears taking part in the annual salmon run which is in full swing. Prints eventually lead him to a grizzly mother and a couple of two-year-old bear cubs. The crew encounters a massive grizzly male, at which point they carefully retreat. Leading the team on a final search, Mears find white hairs on a bear trail near a babbling stream, evidence of the rare Spirit bear. Episode 3: Wolves In the final episode, Mears and his wildlife crew turn their attention to tracking wolves in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. Wolves are secretive animals, which makes searching for them difficult. He has ten days to track them before they are taken off the state's endangered species list, after which point they can be hunted. From the town of Stanley, Mears hikes into the small valleys that drain into the Salmon River. He discovers the tracks of some elk, the principle prey for wolves, and soon finds the tracks of a wolf nearby. The following day the team get a sighting of a small group of wolves and eventually come across an entire pack of around a dozen, following the lead of a silver-backed alpha male. A young female dies during the night, at which point Mears becomes tearful. Worried that the rest of the pack might have suffered the same fate, Mears leads the team on an urgent search. Ultimately they make another sighting of the wolves preying on rodents. It is a relief for Mears and the whole team; providing an emotive finale to the series.

With a few exceptions, they cannot be isolated. However, a structure has been determined on a particularly stable nitrile ylide by X-ray crystallography. Another nitrile ylide has been captured under cryogenic conditions. As ylides, they possess a negative charge and a positive charge on adjacent atoms. As a 1,3-dipole, several resonance structures can be drawn (1a‚Äìd). The most appropriate resonance structure is dependent upon the substituent pattern (the identity of the R and R‚Ä≤ groups in 1 and 2). The 3-dimensional structure of the nitrilium ylide itself may also provide a clue as to the most appropriate resonance structure, with a linear R‚ÄìC‚â°N‚ÄìC unit supportive of the charge distribution indicated for resonance structures 1a & 1b and also consistent with the nomenclature nitrilium ylide. As resonance structures 1c and 1d become more important the nitrilium ylide distorts its geometry in favor of a different valence tautomer, 2. :1024px Nitrile ylides are isoelectronic with nitrile oxides.  Generation  Nitrile ylides can be obtained by the addition of electrophilic carbenes to nitriles, by the photochemical ring opening of azirines and by dehydrochlorination of imidoyl chlorides. The latter is the most reliable method.  Reaction  The synthetically most useful reaction of the nitrile ylides is the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to dipolarophiles: with electron-deficient alkenes, good yields of pyrrolines are obtained. Alkynes, carbonyl compounds, imines and azirines can also act as dipolarophile. Nitrile ylides react with weak acids like methanol by protonation finally leading to a methoxyimine.

She is best known for her journalistic coverage about Mark Hofmann and the \\"Mormon forgery murders.\\" Her subsequent book Salamander, coauthored with Allen Roberts, examined Hofmann's creation of an industry for forged documents, the 1985 bombing murders of two people, and the police investigation, arrest and conviction. The murder investigation eventually revealed Hofmann's documents, initially seen as undermining the early history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, were forgeries. Sillitoe‚Äôs published works also included fiction and poetry.  Biography  Sillitoe was one of eight children born to Robert E. and Phyllis Liddle Buhler. She was reared in Salt Lake City, Utah and graduated from the University of Utah. She married John Sillito (spelling difference intentional), in 1968 and they had three children. Sillitoe was a staff writer for the Deseret News and news feature editor for Utah Holiday magazine. She produced articles which also appeared in The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Utah Business, Sunstone, City Weekly and The Salt Lake City Observer. She was an important feminist voice, particularly among Mormon women. Much of her later work focused on multicultural issues. In 1986, she won an award from the Utah Navajo Development Council \\"for her interest and sensitivity in reporting problems facing the Utah Navajo People.\\" She won awards from the Utah chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists and the Associated Press. Sillitoe received three nominations for a Pulitzer Prize for her stories about life in Salt Lake County. Sillitoe co-produced a PBS-affiliated documentary, \\"Native and American\\" and taught classes in writing at the University of Utah, Salt Lake Community College and Weber State University. She most recently worked as public outreach coordinator of Weber State University‚Äôs Stewart Library. Sillitoe was born a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Her inquisitive nature and feminist beliefs pushed her faith in the LDS Church until she no longer believed. In the early 1990s, she requested that her name be removed from the member rolls and the LDS Church complied. After a long battle with chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), Sillitoe died on April 7, 2010, at the age of 61, of an aortic dissection.  Writings  Sillitoe wrote three important books on aspects of Utah history: \\"Banking on the Hemingways: Three Generations of Banking in Utah and Idaho\\"; \\"Salamander: The Story of the Mormon Forgery Murders\\" (co-authored with Allen Roberts); and \\"Friendly Fire: The ACLU in Utah.\\" In 1996 she wrote the official centennial history of Salt Lake County, published in a popular format as \\"Welcoming the World: A History of Salt Lake County.\\" Sillitoe published a collection of poetry \\"Crazy for Living,\\" a short story collection \\"Windows on the Sea\\", and two novels \\"Sideways to the Sun\\" and \\"Secrets Keep.\\" Her last novel \\"The Thieves Of Summer\\" was published in 2014 by Signature Books.

The Palace of San Telmo () is a historical edifice in Seville, southern Spain, formerly the Universidad de Mareantes (a university for navigators), now is the seat of the presidency of the Andalusian Autonomous Government. Construction of the building began in 1682 outside the walls of the city, on property belonging to the Tribunal of the Holy Office, the institution responsible for the Spanish Inquisition. It was originally constructed as the seat of the University of Navigators (Universidad de Mareantes), a school to educate orphaned children and train them as sailors. Description Palace of San Telmo. Main fa√ßade (b. 1754). The palace is one of the emblematic buildings of Sevillian Baroque architecture. It is built on a rectangular plan, with several interior courtyards, including a central courtyard, towers on the four corners, a chapel, and gardens. The exuberantly baroque chapel, accessed from one of the courtyards, is the work of architect Leonardo de Figueroa; among those involved in its decoration were sculptor Pedro Duque y Cornejo, stonecutter Miguel de Quintana, painter Domingo Mart√≠nez, and carpenter Juan Tom√°s D√≠az. Presiding over the chapel is an early 17th-century statue of Nuestra Se√±ora del Buen Aire (\\"Our Lady of Good Air\\"). Exterior Gallery of illustrious Sevillians, on the fa√ßade facing Calle Palos de la Frontera (b. 1895). The main fa√ßade of the palace is distinguished by the magnificent Churrigueresque entrance completed in 1754, the work of other members of the Figueroa family, specifically Mat√≠as and Antonio Mat√≠as, son and grandson of Leonardo de Figueroa, at a cost of 50,000 pesos. The entryway consists of several parts. The door is flanked by three columns on each side. Over the door is a balcony supported by Atlantes (supports sculpted in the form of a man); twelve allegorical female figures represent the nautical arts and sciences. Finally, there is a sculptural grouping with columns and a figure of Peter Gonz√°lez, Saint Telmo (or Elmo), patron saint of sailors, flanked by the patron saints of the city: Saint Ferdinand (Ferdinand III of Castile) and Saint Hermenegild. Main fa√ßade entrance seen bottom-up. Atop the fa√ßade facing Calle Palos de la Frontera, across from the Hotel Alfonso XIII, are sculptures of twelve illustrious Sevillians, sculpted in 1895 by Antonio Susillo. The twelve figures are: * Juan Mart√≠nez Monta√±√©s, sculptor. * Rodrigo Ponce de Le√≥n, Marquess of C√°diz and Captain General of the Reconquista of Granada. * Diego Rodr√≠guez de Silva y Vel√°zquez, painter. * Miguel Ma√±ara, Knight and philanthropist, founder of Seville's Hospital de la Caridad. * Lope de Rueda, writer. * Fernando de Herrera, poet. * Luis Dao√≠z, military officer, hero of the Spanish War of Independence (Peninsular War). * Benito Arias Montano, humanist. * Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, painter. * Fernando Af√°n de Ribera y Enr√≠quez, Duke of Alcal√°, humanist. * Bartolom√© de las Casas, monk, bishop of Chiapas, Mexico and protector of the Indians. Three of these were Sevillians \\"by adoption\\", born elsewhere, but who lived and died in Seville: Benito Arias Montano was born in Fregenal de la Sierra (province of Badajoz), Rodrigo Ponce de Le√≥n in C√°diz, and Juan Mart√≠nez Monta√±√©s in Alcal√° la Real (province of Ja√©n). The gardens included the Queen's sewing box (Costurero de la Reina), built in 1893 and now in the Parque de Mar√≠a Luisa. This unique building takes the form of a small hexagonal castle with turrets at the corners. It is the oldest building in Seville in the neomud√©jar style.  Rehabilitation  Work began in 1991 to convert the building for use as the official seat of the presidency of the Andalusian Autonomous Government. In 2005, a second phase of restoration took place. It focused on restoring the parts of the 18th and 19th centuries and reforming elements of low architectural value and poor quality of materials made in the 20th century by Basterra y Sagastiz√°bal. History Detail of the main facade upright On 10 March 1682 construction began on the building, dedicated to the University of Navigators (Universidad de Mareantes), an institution that later was called Colegio de Marina and then Colegio de Na√∫tica, a role in which it continued until 1847. Thereafter, the building had a number of uses. First, briefly, it was the headquarters of the Railway Society (Sociedad del Ferrocarril, dedicated to the development of Spain's then nascent railways) and site of the Literary University (Universidad Literaria), but was underutilized and these groups could not afford the upkeep. In 1849 it was bought by Antoine, Duke of Montpensier a son of King Louis Philippe of France, exiled from France after the revolutions of 1848, who converted it into their official residence. The dukedom were not well received in the Spanish Court because Duke claimed for his wife part of the inheritance of Ferdinand VII. Upon the death in 1897 of Infanta Luisa Fernanda, Duchess of Montpensier, the palace was willed to the Archdiocese of Seville; its gardens, which now constitute the Parque de Mar√≠a Luisa, a park site of the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929, were willed to the city of Seville. In 1901, while Marcelo Sp√≠nola was Archbishop of Seville, the palace was converted into a seminary. It remained so until 1989, when the arch- episcopate of Seville ceded the building to the Andalusian Autonomous Government to be the new seat of the presidency.

On 20 July 1944 he was deported to Buchenwald concentration camp, where the number 49489 was tattooed onto his left arm. His sentence was an unspecified time, to be not less than fifteen years.\\"Der Schwarze, der Buchenwald √ºberlebte\\" S√ºddeutsche Zeitung June 5, 2009. Retrieved April 13, 2010 Schramm was put in with the political prisoners, a decision he credits with saving his life. Forced to work in a stone quarry where the survival rate of prisoners was very low. Every day, ten to fifteen men were carried out, dead. He was moved to an easier job by the Communist kapo Willi Bleicher and another Communist prisoner, Otto Grosse, organized others to surround him during the daily roll call, when the prisoners were counted. Unhealthy ones and those who stood out risked being sent to an extermination camp or killed on the spot. Schramm once saw a prisoner, a young Jew from Leipzig named Wolfgang Kohn, get stomped to death by an SS guard, simply because he had moved during roll call. As the only Black prisoner, he already stood out and after weeks in the stone quarry, he was in a weakened state. By surrounding him and moving him to an easier job, he was protected.  Liberation  Schramm was one of the prisoners left at the camp, a better chance of surviving than those made to leave in the death marches. He was there when a thousand citizens from Weimar were forced to visit Buchenwald to see what had transpired there. He remembers thinking, \\"Now have a look what happened here with your acquiescence.\\" Footage of this event exists., black & white film clip of Weimar residents forced to visit Buchenwald concentration camp immediately after liberation. Retrieved April 17, 2010  After 1945  After the liberation of Buchenwald and the end of the Second World War, Schramm returned to his mother in Bad Langensalza. He then worked at the Wismut uranium mine in the Soviet occupation zone. From 1956 to 1964, he worked in Essen in a coal mine, but then chose to move to East Germany, three years after the construction of the Berlin Wall. There, he worked at the Barnimer Busgesellschaft (Barnim Bus Company) in Eberswalde, Brandenburg and resumed his education, becoming a certified mechanic and later, a Meister. He became a shop foreman and department head, went to work at a civil engineering combine, where he worked his way up to department head of the vehicle fleet at the Eberswalde civil engineering combine. With the help of another former Buchenwald prisoner, Hermann Axen, who had been one of a group of Communist prisoners who protected Schramm, he started his own business in 1985, \\"Schramms Reisen,\\" a taxi company now run by his son. Schramm, a widower, lived near family members in Eberswalde. He had four grown children, was a grandfather and great-grandfather. He was a Sch√ºtzenbruder, was involved with the local volunteer fire brigade and was a lay judge. He visited schools to talk about Buchenwald and he was on the prisoners' advisory board of the Buchenwald Memorial Foundation. He died in Erfurt on 18 April 2016 after a long illness.http://www.jenapolis.de/2016/04/20/carius-zum-tode- des-ehemaligen-buchenwald-haeftlings-gert-schramm/  See also  * Buchenwald Resistance * Nazism and race * Robert Siewert  Further reading  *  Film  * *  References  Category:Buchenwald concentration camp survivors Category:1928 births Category:2016 deaths Category:German people of African- American descent ","title":"Gert Schramm"},{"id":"26945591","text":"Plinkart is a mobile phone application designed to identify works of art, created by Mark Cummins and James Philbin.

This system exists because the glycosylases which normally target deaminated bases cannot target thymine (it being one of the regular four bases in DNA). The components of the system are MutS, which binds to the GT mismatch, the VSR endonuclease, which cuts the DNA, and MutL, which recruits the UvrD helicase. VSR (very short patch repair) endonucleases occur in a variety of bacteria. They work by cutting, or rather, making a nick in DNA if the base pair is mutated or damaged. Function Mutations in the base pairs of DNA can be harmful to the organism. In particular, C to T mutations occur quite often due to methylation of cytosine. Hence, the VSR endonucleases have a function to protect the cell from damage caused by mutated DNA. Mechanism VSR recognises a TG mismatched base pair, generated after spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines, and it creates a nick on a single strand by cleaving the phosphate backbone on the 5' side of the thymine. Then DNA Polymerase I removes the T and some nucleotides on the 3' strand and then resynthesises the patch. Additionally, GT mismatches can lead to C-to-T transition mutations if not repaired. VSR repairs the mismatches in favour of the G-containing strand. In Escherichia coli, this endonuclease nicks double-stranded DNA within the sequence CT(AT)GN or NT(AT)GG next to the thymidine residue, which is mismatched to 2'-deoxyguanosine. The incision is mismatch-dependent and strand specific. Structure The structure of VSR is similar to the core structure of restriction endonucleases, which have a 3-layer alpha/beta/alpha topology. VSR has three aromatic residues (Phe67, Trp68 and Trp86), which intercalate into the major groove, bending the DNA and separating the two strands. The N-terminal domain stabilizes the interaction between the protein and the cleaved product, thereby protecting the nick from DNA ligase until the arrival of DNA Polymerase I.

The area's geology encompasses the last 80 million years. The oldest rocks exposed here were formed during the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era, when the dinosaurs still roamed the earth and pterodactyls dominated the sky. The area forms part of the Salinian Block, a sliver of continental crust caught up in the transform boundary between the Pacific and North American Plates. Point Lobos is the common name for the landform and area, which include Point Lobos State Reserve on land; and two adjoining marine protected areas: Point Lobos State Marine Reserve (SMR) and Point Lobos State Marine Conservation Area.  Santa Lucia Granodiorite During the Cretaceous period the west coast of North America was the site of an active chain of volcanoes. Active subduction created magma chambers that fed the volcanoes. This magma cooled slowly at depths of 10‚Äì20 km below the earth's surface to form a granitic intrusion known as the Santa Lucia Granodiorite. Granodiorite is made of quartz, orthoclase, plagioclase, amphibole, and biotite mica. Radiometric data indicate an age of 79.5 million years for the granodiorite. Over the next 30 million years the Santa Lucia Granodiorite rose to the earth's surface and was eroded. The granodiorite provides the basement rock for the younger sedimentary deposits of Point Lobos. Carmelo Formation at Point Lobos. Carmelo Formation Around 55 million years ago, in the Paleocene Epoch of the Paleogene Period (Cenozoic Era), a submarine canyon cut down through the granodiorite basement rock and sediments comprising the Carmelo Formation were deposited. The Carmelo consists of pebble to cobble conglomerate, medium to coarse grained sandstone and mudstone. The included pebbles are mostly of volcanic origin. They were brought by rivers draining volcanic highlands. During transport their rough shape became rounded and polished. The sediments were deposited as submarine landslides and turbidity currents. Fossils include shells, burrows that were made up by worms, and mysterious seaweed-like trace fossils. The shells, pebbles, and other material were deposited, together with sand and mud, within the walls of submarine canyons and became lithified. The Carmelo Formation is the second major rock type at Point Lobos. The Carmelo is easily recognizable along the southern shore of Point Lobos.VOLCANO-HOME Sandstone rock formation at Point Lobos. Marine terraces About 18,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene Epoch of the Quaternary Period (Cenozoic Era), the level of the Pacific Ocean was considerably lower than it is now (because more water was in the polar ice- caps and continental glaciers). Deep submarine canyons were cut in the Monterey Bay area, as an extension of the Salinas River. During late Cenozoic Era, because of sustained transpression of the Pacific Plate onto the American Plate along the nearby San Andreas Fault Zone, there was continued uplift of the entire coastline of California, so that erosive action of marine waves cut these terraces in the Monterey Bay area. Those Pleistocene marine terraces are composed of clay, silt, sand and gravel with a basal unconformity of gravel on top of rock. The creation of uplifted marine terraces that started to appear during the Pleistocene Epoch continues throughout the (present) Holocene Epoch of the Quaternary Period due to transpression of the Pacific Plate onto the American Plate. During the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the marine terraces of the Monterey Bay were further uplifted. Both Monterey and Santa Cruz have classical uplifted wave-cut shorelines with multiple sets of uplifted and exposed marine terraces. Sand and gravel The fourth and the youngest type of rocks is sand and gravel. It is found along the beaches. Once again it has been created by the action of waves and rain that cause erosion of the others type of rocks. The age of this kind of rocks varies from ten thousand years ago up to the present day.

All NDL sanctioned amateur, college, and youth events abide exclusively by NDL rules. The rules are subject to modification at the sole discretion of the NDL to accommodate and respond to the ever evolving game of dodgeball. Court Official NDL court diagram The official dimensions for a regulation court are as follows: The court is divided into two by areas, with a by neutral zone located at center court separating the two sides, an attack line located parallel and from the center line, for a total court length of from endline to endline, and a total width of from sideline to sideline. Approximately to should be allotted for an out of bounds area, allowing officials to move freely along the sidelines. The Queue for each team is a by area, and should be located to from the sideline, leaving enough room for an official to move freely along the sideline. Every effort should be made to obtain the correct dimensions. However court size may be adjusted to best suit the available space. Equipment=Stinger Division Six regulation size rubber balls should be used: 4 blockers () and 2 stingers (). Prior to starting the game, the balls should be arranged along the center court line as follows: blocker, stinger, blocker, blocker, stinger, blocker. Big Ball Divisions Six regulation size rubber balls should be used: 6 blockers (). Prior to starting the game, the balls should be arranged along the center court line. No- Sting Divisions Six regulation size no-sting balls (typically foam) should be used: 6 blockers (). Prior to starting the game, the balls should be arranged along the center court line. Players=Teams Teams consist of six players with up to four substitutes. It is normally said that all players must be in uniform. Coed teams may consist of either gender, however at least two players of each gender must participate at the start of each game. Open teams may consist of either gender. Any ratio of men and women may participate, including all male and all female teams. Substitutions Substitutions must be made prior to the start of the game. No substitutions can be made during a game, except in cases of injury. Retrievers Retrievers are individuals designated to retrieve balls that go out of play. Teams are responsible for providing retrievers. The number of retrievers required will be determined by the tournament director. Teams may use players that are out as retrievers. Retrievers may not enter the court at any time. Retrievers may not wear jerseys of the same style as their team uniform. Retrievers are only allowed to field balls from their side of the court. Matches A regulation match consists of a predetermined odd number of games of a single game type. The number of games and/or the time allotted may be altered to best suit time and attendance. Game types=Elimination game A game played until all opponents on one side have been eliminated. The first team to eliminate all its opponents is declared the winner. Timed game A game played until a predetermined time limit expires or all opponents are eliminated on one side. If time expires, all remaining players are counted. The team with most players remaining wins the game. Scored game A scored game is played as either an elimination or timed game with points awarded not for the win, but for the number of players remaining \\"in\\" at the end of each game. Game play Play begins with all players positioned behind their team's endline. The Rush The Rush occurs at the beginning of each game or reset. Upon the official's signal, both teams rush to center court and attempt to retrieve as many balls as possible. A team may rush with as many or as few players as it wants, but at least one person from each team has to Rush. There is no limit to how many balls an individual player may retrieve. Players may not slide or dive head first into the neutral zone or they will be called out. Crossing over the neutral zone will result in an \\"out.\\" Players may not physically grab and pull another player across the neutral zone or prevent them from returning to their side of the court. Putting a ball in play The player and the ball must go completely behind the attack line. During the Rush, any ball retrieved from the neutral zone must be returned behind the attack line before it may be thrown at an opponent. A ball that hasn't crossed the attack line is considered a dead ball, any hits or catches are voided plays. There are several ways to put a ball into play following a Rush: * A player carries the ball across the attack line. * A player passes the ball to a teammate who is behind or carries it across the attack line. * A player rebounds the ball off the back wall of a closed court. Time Outs There are 2 Outs A player shall be deemed \\"out\\": * When a live ball hits any part of the player's body, clothing, or uniform. * If a player is hit by a live ball rebounding off another player or ball lying on the court. * If a defending player catches a live ball they have thrown. Players shall return from the Queue in the order they were put \\"out\\" (i.e. first \\"out,\\" first \\"in\\"). Blocking Players can defend themselves by blocking the ball in flight with another ball but must retain control over the ball they are blocking with. A player dropping or losing possession of the blocking ball is deemed \\"out.\\" Any blocked ball rebounding off another ball is considered live. Any player hit by the rebounding ball is deemed \\"out.\\" Pinching The act of squeezing the ball in order to alter the thrown or blocked ball is not allowed. Stalling The act of intentionally delaying the game. If a referee determines that a player or team is stalling, the referee will warn player or team. If the stalling continues, at the referee's discretion, player or team will lose possession of all balls on their side. If both teams are stalling a reset should occur. Out of Bounds Rule If any part of the player's body touches the endlines or far neutral zone line, the player shall be deemed \\"out\\". Momentum may carry a player out of bounds while making a catch. If control of the ball was established prior going out of bounds, this is NOT deemed an out. Neutral Zone Rule A player may safely step into the neutral zone but not across the centerline. Any player crossing over the centerline (located in between the two sections of the neutral zone) is deemed \\"out.\\" Sacrifice Fly An airborne attack, where an attacking player may legally cross the neutral zone to hit an opponent but the ball must leave the attacker's hand before any part of the attacker's body touches the opponent's territory. If successful, the player hit is out and Attacking player remains in. Headshots A headshot occurs when a player is hit directly in the head by a high thrown ball. A high thrown ball is a ball thrown above shoulder height of the person hit in the head. Shoulder height is the height of the shoulders of the player in an upright standing position. If a player is ducking or crouching and hit in the head this will NOT be deemed a headshot as the ball was NOT thrown above shoulder height. In tournament/events allowing headshots, any person hit on any portion of their body will be considered \\"out\\". In tournament/events NOT allowing headshots, a player hit in the head by a high thrown ball will be deemed \\"safe\\", and any thrower committing a headshot will be deemed \\"out.\\" A player raising their hands/arms to defend themselves from a headshot will not be called \\"out\\" if the ball hits their hands/arms above shoulder height in the act of defending themselves; and the thrower will be called \\"safe\\". A player unsuccessful in their attempt to catch a high thrown ball will be deemed \\"out\\". It is the official's judgment as to whether the player is defending themselves or attempting to catch the ball. A ball deflected by another ball, player, or object is no longer considered a high thrown ball. Should the ball strike a player in the head, that player shall be deemed \\"out\\", even if their own block deflected the ball. Uniforms Uniforms and protective equipment are considered part of the player. Any player hit on any part of their uniform or protective equipment will be considered \\"out\\". The NDL does not allow players to wear gloves, baseball caps, visors, or bandanas during play. Each team should wear uniforms as specified in the NDL uniform guidelines.

Cross modal plasticity is the adaptive reorganization of neurons to integrate the function of two or more sensory systems. Cross modal plasticity is a type of neuroplasticity and often occurs after sensory deprivation due to disease or brain damage. The reorganization of the neural network is greatest following long-term sensory deprivation, such as congenital blindness or pre-lingual deafness. In these instances, cross modal plasticity can strengthen other sensory systems to compensate for the lack of vision or hearing. This strengthening is due to new connections that are formed to brain cortices that no longer receive sensory input. Plasticity in the blind Even though the blind are no longer able to see, the visual cortex is still in active use, although it deals with information different from visual input. Studies found that the volume of white matter (myelinated nerve connections) was reduced in the optic tract, but not in the primary visual cortex itself. However, grey matter volume was reduced by up to 25% in the primary visual cortex. The atrophy of grey matter, the neuron bodies, is likely due to its association with the optic tract. Because the eyes no longer receive visual information, the disuse of the connected optic tract causes a loss of grey matter volume in the primary visual cortex. White matter is thought to atrophy in the same way, although the primary visual cortex is less affected. For example, blind individuals show enhanced perceptual and attentional sensitivity for identification of different auditory stimuli, including speech sounds. The spatial detection of sound can be interrupted in the early blind by inducing a virtual lesion in the visual cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation. The somatosensory cortex is also able to recruit the visual cortex to assist with tactile sensation. Cross modal plasticity reworks the network structure of the brain, leading to increased connections between the somatosensory and visual cortices.https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/21/9/2133/381559 Furthermore, the somatosensory cortex acts as a hub region of nerve connections in the brain for the early blind but not for the sighted. With this cross-modal networking the early blind are able to react to tactile stimuli with greater speed and accuracy, as they have more neural pathways to work with. One element of the visual system that the somatosensory cortex is able to recruit is the dorsal-visual stream. The dorsal stream is used by the sighted to identify spatial information visually, but the early blind use it during tactile sensation of 3D objects. However, both sighted and blind participants used the dorsal stream to process spatial information, suggesting that cross modal plasticity in the blind re-routed the dorsal visual stream to work with the sense of touch rather than changing the overall function of the stream. Experience dependence There is evidence that the degree of cross modal plasticity between the somatosensory and visual cortices is experience- dependent. In a study using tactile tongue devices to transmit spatial information, early blind individuals were able to show visual cortex activations after 1 week of training with the device. Although there were no cross modal connections at the start, the early blind were able to develop connections between the somatosensory and visual cortices while sighted controls were unable to. Early or congenitally blind individuals have stronger cross modal connections the earlier they began learning Braille. An earlier start allows for stronger connections to form as early blind children have to grow up using their sense of touch to read instead of using their sight. Perhaps due to these cross modal connections, sensory testing studies have shown that people who are born blind and read braille proficiently perceive through touch more rapidly than others. Furthermore, tactile spatial acuity is enhanced in blindness and this enhancement is experience-dependent. Plasticity in the deaf Cross modal plasticity can also occur in pre- lingual deaf individuals. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study found that deaf participants use the primary auditory cortex as well as the visual cortex when they observe sign language. Although the auditory cortex no longer receives input from the ears, the deaf can still use specific regions of the cortex to process visual stimuli. Primary sensory abilities like brightness discrimination, visual contrast sensitivity, temporal discrimination thresholds, temporal resolution, and discrimination thresholds for motion directions do not appear to change in the loss of a modality like hearing. However, higher-level processing tasks may undergo compensating changes. In the case of auditory deprivation, some of these compensations appear to affect visual periphery processing and movement detection in peripheral vision. Deaf individuals lack auditory input, so the auditory cortex is instead used to assist with visual and language processing. Auditory activations also appear to be attention-dependent in the deaf. However, the process of visual attention in the deaf is not significantly different from that of hearing subjects. Stronger activations of the auditory cortex during visual observation occur when deaf individuals pay attention to a visual cue, and the activations are weaker if the cue is not in the direct line of sight. One study found that deaf participants process peripheral visual stimuli more quickly than hearing subjects. Deafness appears to heighten spatial attention to the peripheral visual field, but not the central one. The brain thus seems to compensate for the auditory loss within its visual system by enhancing peripheral field attention resources; however, central visual resources may suffer. Improvements tend to be limited to areas in the brain dedicated to both auditory and visual stimuli, not simply rewriting audio-dedicated areas into visual areas. The visual enhancements seem to be especially focused in areas of the brain that normally process convergence with auditory input. This is specifically seen in studies showing changes in the posterior parietal cortex of deaf individuals, which is both one of the main centers for visual attention but also an area known for integrating information from various senses. Recent research indicates that in attention-based tasks such as object tracking and enumeration, deaf subjects perform no better than hearing subjects. Improvement in visual processing is still observed, even when a deaf subject is not paying attention to the direct stimulus. A study published in 2011 found that congenitally deaf subjects had significantly larger neuroretinal rim areas than hearing subjects, which suggests that deaf subjects may have a greater concentration of retinal ganglion cells. Sign language Deaf individuals often use sign language as their mode of communication. However, sign language alone does not appear to significantly change brain organization. In fact, neuroimaging and electrophysiology data studying functional changes in visual pathways, as well as animal studies of sensory deprivation, have shown that the enhancement in attention of peripheral visual processing found in deaf individuals is not found in hearing signers. The peripheral visual changes are seen in all forms of deaf individuals ‚Äì signers, oral communicators, etc. Comparative fMRIs of hearing speakers and hearing early signers, on the other hand, show comparable peripheral activation. The enhancement in attention of peripheral visual processing found in deaf individuals has not been found in hearing signers. It is therefore unlikely that signing causes the neurological differences in visual attention. Cochlear implants Another way to see cross modal plasticity in the deaf is when looking at the effects of installing cochlear implants. For those who became deaf pre-lingually, cross modal plasticity interfered with their ability to process language using a cochlear implant. For the pre-lingual deaf, the auditory cortex has been reshaped to deal with visual information, so it cannot deal as well with the new sensory input that the implant provides. However, for post-lingual deaf their experience with visual cues like lip reading can help them understand speech better along with the assistance of a cochlear implant. The post-lingual deaf do not have as much recruitment of the auditory cortex as the early deaf, so they perform better with cochlear implants. It was also found that the visual cortex was activated only when the sounds that were received had potential meaning. For instance, the visual cortex activated for words but not for vowels. This activation is further evidence that cross modal plasticity is attention dependent. Plasticity after olfactory deficit or whisker trimming Cross- modal plasticity can be mutually induced between two sensory modalities. For instance, the deprivation of olfactory function upregulate whisker tactile sensation, and on the other hand, the trimming of whiskers upregulates olfactory function. In terms of cellular mechanisms, the coordinated plasticity between cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons is associated with these upregulations of sensory behaviors.Upregulation of barrel GABAergic neurons is associated with cross-modal plasticity in olfactory deprivation> References Category:Neuroplasticity ","title":"Cross modal plasticity"},{"id":"26945776","text":"Coast Guardsman - Boatswain Mate Second Class (BM2) David M.

The boy and a friend were fishing off the point when he was swept out to sea by the high surf. His young companion tossed a log out to the boy and ran for help. When advised of the accident, Petty Officer LORANGE and three shipmates from U.S. Coast Guard Loran Monitor Station Saipan immediately proceeded to the scene. Upon arrival, the boy was observed approximately 70-yards offshore, holding on to the log in an area locally known as ‚ÄúShark Alley.‚Äù With complete disregard for his own safety, Petty Officer LORANGE dove off the 10 to 12-foot cliff and swam through the 15-foot breaking surf and 10-foot swells to the helpless boy. Reaching the bleeding victim, Petty Officer LORANGE quickly calmed him down and towed him to the base of the cliff. The other Coast Guardsmen then tossed him a life ring with a line attached. While being pulled to safety, Petty Officer LORANGE maintained his hold on the boy while using his feet to fend off the side of the cliff. With the boy safely ashore, Petty Officer LORANGE, a trained EMT, assisted in treating the boy for shock and lacerations while en route to the hospital.

It is the seventh crossing from the river's mouth at Newark Bay and is upstream from it. Also known as the Amtrak Dock Vertical Lift, it carries Amtrak, NJ Transit, and PATH trains. It is listed on the state and federal registers of historic places. History Looking west along the Passaic River The bridge was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) for its main line. The west span carries three tracks and opened in 1935 along with the west half of Newark Penn Station. The lift span is over bearings (clear channel ), the longest three-track lift span in the world when built. The east spans opened in 1937 when the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H&M;, later called PATH) shifted its rapid transit trains from the Centre Street Bridge to the newly built station. With the opening of the eastern span, the PRR closed Manhattan Transfer station in the Kearny Meadows, where previously steam and electrical trains were changed and passengers could transfer to trains to New York Penn Station on the PRR or to Hudson Terminal on the H&M.; Description The west span carries three tracks exclusively used by Amtrak and NJ Transit for Northeast Corridor intercity and commuter traffic between Newark and New York City. The east span carries two PATH tracks used by PATH's Newark-World Trade Center service and one NEC track shared by Amtrak and NJ Transit. Due partly to PATH's use of the Dock Bridge, it is legally a commuter railroad under the jurisdiction of the Federal Railroad Administration even though it has long operated as a rapid transit system.

While primarily known for his work in jazz as the leader of the Branford Marsalis Quartet, he also performs frequently as a soloist with classical ensembles and has led the group Buckshot LeFonque. From 1992 to 1995 he led The Tonight Show Band. Early life Marsalis was born in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana. He is the son of Dolores (n√©e Ferdinand), a jazz singer and substitute teacher, and Ellis Louis Marsalis, Jr., a pianist and music professor.Stated on Finding Your Roots, PBS, March 25, 2012 His brothers Jason Marsalis, Wynton Marsalis, and Delfeayo Marsalis are also jazz musicians.  Career = Musical beginnings: 1980‚Äì85  In mid-1980, while still a Berklee College of Music student, Marsalis toured Europe playing alto and baritone saxophone in a large ensemble led by drummer Art Blakey. Other big band experiences with Lionel Hampton and Clark Terry followed over the next year, and by the end of 1981 Marsalis, on alto saxophone, had joined his brother Wynton in Blakey's Jazz Messengers. Other performances with his brother, including a 1981 Japanese tour with Herbie Hancock, led to the formation of his brother Wynton's first quintet, where Marsalis shifted his emphasis to soprano and tenor saxophones. He continued to work with Wynton until 1985, a period that also saw the release of his own first recording, Scenes in the City, as well as guest appearances with other artists including Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie  Expanded output: 1985‚Äì95  Branford Marsalis at Monterey Jazz Festival 1992 In 1985, he joined Sting, singer and bassist of rock band the Police, he played at Live Aid on the 13th of July. on his first solo project, The Dream of the Blue Turtles, alongside jazz and session musicians Omar Hakim on drums, Darryl Jones on the bass and Kenny Kirkland on keyboards. He became a regular in Sting's line-up both in the studio and live up until the release of Brand New Day in 1999. In 1986, Marsalis formed the Branford Marsalis Quartet with pianist Kirkland, drummer Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts and bass player Robert Hurst. That year, they released their first album, Royal Garden Blues. That lineup of the quartet would go on to release four more albums, the last of which, I Heard You Twice the First Time (1992), won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Album, Individual or Group. In 1988, Marsalis co-starred in the Spike Lee film School Daze, also rendering several horn-blowing interludes for the music in the film. His witty comments have pegged him to many memorable one-liners in the film. In 1989, Marsalis played a 30 second cover of \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" over the opening logos of Lee's film Do the Right Thing. Between 1990 and 1994, Branford played with the Grateful Dead numerous times, and appeared on their 1990 live album Without a Net. In 1992, Marsalis became the leader of the Tonight Show Band on the newly-launched The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, after Jay Leno replaced Johnny Carson. Initially, Marsalis turned down the offer, but later reconsidered and accepted the position. He brought with him the three other members of the Branford Marsalis Quartet, who became the Tonight Show Band's pianist, drummer and bass player, respectively. In 1994, Marsalis formed the group Buckshot LeFonque (named after a pseudonym once used by Cannonball Adderley), a jazz group with elements of rock and hip-hop. That year, they released their first album, Buckshot LeFonque, which was mostly produced by DJ Premier. In 1994, Marsalis appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool. The album, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic in African American society, was named Album of the Year by Time. In 1995, Marsalis left The Tonight Show, having become unhappy in the role: he disliked that he was supposed to always show enthusiasm, even for jokes he thought were unfunny. He was succeeded as bandleader by guitarist Kevin Eubanks. In a well-publicized interview soon after leaving, Marsalis said, \\"The job of musical director I found out later was just to kiss the ass of the host, and I ain't no ass kisser.\\" He also complained that when he did not laugh or smile, some viewers' perception was, \\"Oh, he‚Äôs surly. He hates his boss.\\" When the interviewer asked if Marsalis did hate Leno, Marsalis responded, \\"Oh, I despised him.\\" He later stated that he did not hate Leno, and that this was a sarcastic response to what he considered \\"a ridiculous question\\".  Transition: 1995‚Äì2007  In 1997, bassist Eric Revis replaced Hurst in the Branford Marsalis Quartet. Kirkland died the following year, and was replaced by pianist Joey Calderazzo. The Branford Marsalis Quartet has since toured and recorded extensively. For two decades Marsalis was associated with Columbia, where he served as creative consultant and producer for jazz recordings between 1997 and 2001, including signing saxophonist David S. Ware for two albums. In 2002, Marsalis founded his own label, Marsalis Music. Its catalogue includes Claudia Acu√±a, Harry Connick Jr., Doug Wamble, Miguel Zen√≥n, in addition to albums by members of the Marsalis family. Marsalis has also become involved in college education, with appointments at Michigan State University (1996‚Äì2000), San Francisco State University (2000‚Äì2002), and North Carolina Central University (2005‚Äìpresent). After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Marsalis and Harry Connick, Jr., working with the local Habitat for Humanity, created Musicians Village in New Orleans, with the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music the centerpiece.  Classical and Broadway projects: 2008‚Äì10  Under the direction of conductor Gil Jardim, Branford Marsalis and members of the Philharmonia Brasileira toured the United States in the fall of 2008, performing works by Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, arranged for solo saxophone and orchestra. This project commemorated the 50th Anniversary of the revered Brazilian composer s death. Marsalis and the members of his quartet joined the North Carolina Symphony for American Spectrum, released in February 2009 by Sweden's BIS Records. The album showcases Marsalis and the orchestra performing a range of American music by Michael Daugherty, John Williams, Ned Rorem and Christopher Rouse, while being conducted by Grant Llewellyn. Marsalis wrote the music for the 2010 Broadway revival of the August Wilson play Fences. On July 14, 2010, Marsalis made his debut with the New York Philharmonic on Central Park's Great Lawn. Led by conductor Andrey Boreyko, Marsalis and the New York Philharmonic performed Glazunov's \\"Concerto for Alto Saxophone\\" and Schuloff's \\"Hot-Sonate for Alto Saxophone and Orchestra.\\" Boreyko, Marsalis and the Philharmonic performed the same program again in Vail, CO later that month and four more times at Avery Fisher Hall in New York, NY the following February.  2011‚Äìpresent  Branford Marsalis at a concert in Bielsko-Biala, Poland at the Lotos Jazz Festival 2019 In June 2011, after working together for over 10 years in a band setting, Branford Marsalis and Joey Calderazzo released their first duo album titled Songs of Mirth and Melancholy, on Branford's label, Marsalis Music. Their first public performance was at the 2011 TD Toronto Jazz Festival. In 2012, Branford Marsalis released Four MFs Playin' Tunes on deluxe 180-gram high definition vinyl, prior to Record Store Day 2012 on April 21, 2012. This is the first recording of the Branford Marsalis Quartet with drummer Justin Faulkner, who joined the band in 2009, and was the first vinyl release from Marsalis Music. The album was named Apple iTunes Best of 2012 Instrumental Jazz Album of the Year. Marsalis performed \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" on Wednesday, September 5, 2012 at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. In 2019 Marsalis released The Secret Between the Shadow and the Soul, which he recorded in Australia with his quartet. Marsalis, commenting on the longevity of his band and their approach said, ahead of the album's release: '‚ÄúStaying together allows us to play adventurous, sophisticated music and sound good. Lack of familiarity leads to defensive playing, playing not to make a mistake. I like playing sophisticated music, and I couldn‚Äôt create this music with people I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Awards and honors * The Branford Marsalis Quartet received a Grammy Award in 2001 for their album Contemporary Jazz. * In September 2006, Branford Marsalis was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

He is known as the Buchenwald child from the novel by Bruno Apitz, Naked Among Wolves. He survived the Buchenwald concentration camp at age four under protection from his father and other prisoners. Early years Stefan Jerzy Zweig was born in Krak√≥w. He lived with his parents, Helena and Dr. Zacharias Zweig and his sister, Sylwia Zweig in the Krak√≥w ghetto. The family was split up in August 1944. His mother and sister were murdered in Auschwitz.Bill Niven, The Buchenwald child: truth, fiction, and propaganda Camden House (2007), pp. 151-178. Retrieved April 15, 2010 Zweig and his father were brought to Buchenwald in 1944, when Zweig was just three years old. He was arrested with the notation, \\"Polit Pole Jude\\" (political Polish Jewish) and was given the prisoner number 67509.Ulrich Weinzierl, \\"Das Kind von Buchenwald\\" (\\"The Child from Buchenwald\\") Die Welt April 9, 2005. Retrieved August 4, 2009 Willi Bleicher and Robert Siewert, prisoner functionaries, took care of Zweig's welfare. When scheduled to be sent to Auschwitz just a few weeks after arriving, he was hidden in the typhus ward of the infirmary. Later, his name appeared on a transport list and was switched with that of Willi Blum, a 16-year-old Romani boy who was killed in his place. Through such interventions, Zweig was able to survive until Buchenwald was liberated. After liberation Because of an illness, Zweig stayed in Europe until 1949, living in Poland, Switzerland and France before moving to Israel with his father, where his father found work as a clerk in the Finance Ministry. Zweig graduated from school and completed his military service in the Israeli army. He then studied mathematics at the University of Tel Aviv. With help from former R√©sistance member and French Buchenwald survivor, Pierre Sudreau, he received a stipend to continue his studies in Lyon at the Institute for Applied Polytechnology in summer 1963. In 1958, a novel by Buchenwald survivor Bruno Apitz, Naked Among Wolves (Nackt unter W√∂lfen), was published in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and became a surprise bestseller. In 1963, it was turned into a film by Frank Beyer, with Armin M√ºller-Stahl in the main role. Two audience members at a Moscow screening recognized the story. Subsequently, journalists from the East Berlin newspaper, Berliner Zeitung Am Abend went looking for Zweig, finding him in Lyon, where he had just resumed his university studies.\\"Naked Among Wolves\\" Movie plot summary and commentary. Retrieved April 13, 2010 Zweig was offered a chance to study cinematography at the Filmhochschule in the Babelsberg suburb of Berlin and he moved to the GDR in February 1964. While there, he interned with Beyer. He married an East German teacher and often spoke to groups of school children. In 1972, he moved to Vienna with his wife and son. His father was to join them, but he died that year. Zweig later got a job as a cameraman at the √ñsterreichischer Rundfunk, where he worked for many years. In 2005, the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Buchenwald, Zweig published his own book, Tr√§nen allein gen√ºgen nicht (Tears alone are not enough), telling his own story and defending his rescuers from defamation as \\"Stalinists\\". Connection to Naked Among Wolves Apitz did not know Zweig at Buchenwald. He based the novel on his own experiences and on hearsay about Zweig. Some testimonies and parts of the novel match Zweig's original story. For example, Zweig's story was that his father had smuggled him into the camp; Apitz wrote that a Polish officer and prisoner of war initially smuggled the child into the concentration camp in a suitcase, and shortly thereafter, was sent to an extermination camp, where he was presumably killed. In his 2003 novel, Anders (Different), Hans Joachim Sch√§dlich wrote about distortions of facts in fiction, including Apitz' novel, implying that Zweig, as a four-year- old, also shared guilt for the death of Willy Blum. Zweig's father wrote an article about his son's experience for the Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem. Published in 1987, it was called, \\"Mein Vater, was machst du hier...? Zwischen Buchenwald und Auschwitz\\" (\\"My father, what are you doing here...? Between Buchenwald and Auschwitz\\").

The mansion was built on the corner of Court and High Street (now Martin Luther King Boulevard) in 1888 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 9, 1972. History The 40 room mansion was built in 1888 by Gottfried Krueger (1837‚Äì1926), founder of Newark's Gottfried Krueger Brewing Company and owner of several other breweries. The construction cost at the time was $250,000. The mansion was sold to the Valley of Newark Scottish Rite Freemasons in 1926 for $100,000. A 700-seat auditorium was added to the mansion to accommodate for various meetings. The mansion was purchased in 1958 by Louise Scott for $85,000. Scott operated a beauty school out of the first floor of the mansion while keeping the upper levels as her private residence. The mansion was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic places in 1972. Scott died in 1982 and ownership of the mansion passed to the city of Newark. In 1991, the New Jersey Historic Trust funded a bond for $625,812 to stabilize the exterior of the building. The city of Newark matched that amount, and over the years devoted more than $4 million to turning the home into a center focusing on the black contribution to Newark's development. The federal government contributed an additional $1.5 million., but after a decade of work, plans to turn the house into an African-American cultural center were frozen by the city's Municipal Council, which refused to allocate any more money for the project. Construction The mansion is a three-story brick Late Victorian style building with a five-story circular tower. A wrap around porch, steeply pitched roof, asymmetrical facade and arched front entryway are characteristic of the Queen Anne Style. The building is a balloon frame structure with a brick facade. The interior consists of lath and plaster walls with wallpaper covering and wood molding. The flooring is made of hardwood set into patterns. The pedimented windows are an Italianate influence here. Conversion to artisan housing and workspaces In late 2020, the city and the company Makerhoods broke ground on refurbishing the mansion into live/work spaces for local experienced \\"makers\\" in the food, beauty, craft and other small-scall artisan industries for $1800 a month by application only.https://www.nj.com/essex/2020/09/historic-mansion-neglected-for-decades- in-newark-slated-to-become-artisan- housing.htmlhttps://www.makerhoods.com/applyhttps://njbiz.com/newark- makerhoods-break-ground-reinvention-krueger-scott-mansion/ Gallery File:Krueger_Scott_Mansion.jpgCorner of Court Street and Dr. MLK Jr. Boulevard.

This represented approximately 16% of all the country's coffee export that year, totaling 3.2 million bags. The coffee was sold primarily the European Union, Japan, Australia and South Sudan. The company also markets directly to the major international coffee roasting companies. When Uganda's coffee crop was nearly decimated by the coffee wilt disease in the 1990s and early 2000s, Kyagalanyi played a major role in re-seeding with wilt-resistant varieties of Robusta coffee. At the company's facility in Nakanyonyi Village, Mukono District, Kyagalanyi established a nursery with these new varieties and supplied them to farmers at no cost. The company has its main processing plant in Kampala's Industrial Area and another processing factory in Mbale, that is dedicated to processing Arabica coffee, that is grown in the mountainous region around Mount Elgon.

Background Just prior to the American Civil War in the late 1850s, the cities of Tucson and Mesilla in southern New Mexico Territory petitioned the United States government to create a separate Territory of Arizona. The proposal was defeated after representatives from the Northern \\"free\\" states and the Southern \\"slave\\" states could not agree on how to divide New Mexico Territory. Southerners wanted an east-west division, whereas Northerners favored a north-south division of the territory. After the war began, the Confederacy established the Arizona Territory in February 1862 using the east-west boundary. Subsequently, the United States created Arizona Territory in 1863 using the current state boundary. Anglo-Arizonans had hoped the creation of a new territory would strengthen their communications with the east and allow for more military aid. Apaches had been fighting a bloody war in the region, leaving Tucson surrounded by occupied Apache land. Only Tucson's old presidio walls protected the population from harm. When Union troops left Arizona to fight in the South and the Butterfield Overland Mail stations were abandoned, the residents of the region were left with no military support for protection against the Apache. After the arrival of a Confederate force from Texas in mid-1861, the Confederates established small militia garrisons in Tucson, Mesilla, Pinos Altos and other towns in Confederate Arizona. Although these militiamen would fight the Apache successfully in several different engagements, more military strength was needed to hold on to the territory. In early 1862, just before the first Confederate capture of Albuquerque in New Mexico Territory, General Henry Hopkins Sibley ordered Captain Sherod Hunter of Tennessee to proceed to Tucson with a small company of Confederate Arizona Rangers from Dona Ana (New Mexico) and Texas cavalry. Jack Swilling was a member of the Tucson reinforcement; he would go on to found the future state capital of Phoenix in 1867.Jack Swilling The force consisted of about seventy-five men. Captain Hunter's orders were to establish a military alliance with the Pima (Akimel O'odham) and to watch for the advance of the California Volunteers. This Union force would begin its march from Fort Yuma, California, and eventually capture Mesilla and Franklin (El Paso), Texas. Colonel James Reily accompanied Captain Hunter when he left for Tucson. Colonel Reily commanded an escort of twenty men of the Pinos Altos Arizona Guards, another Confederate Arizona militia company. The Arizona Guards were composed primarily of men who left their homes around Tubac and Tucson following the Siege of Tubac in August 1861. About 100 Confederates arrived in Tucson on February 28, 1862, where they joined with the small Tucson militia, numbering about twenty-five men. Other than this force of approximately 100 cavalrymen, additional military support from the South never arrived. The formal flag-raising occurred on March 1, after which Colonel Reily and his escort went south to Sonora, Mexico for a mission of diplomacy. In early May, the garrison of Tucson fought two battles with the Apache while foraging for supplies in the Dragoon Mountains. The first engagement was a defeat for the rebels and the second was a victory. After the skirmish at Stanwix Station, the Battle of Picacho Peak, and the capture of a Union squad in the Pima villages, Colonel James Henry Carleton and his army of over 2,000 Californians occupied abandoned Fort Breckinridge to the northeast of Tucson. On May 14, the Californians began their march to Tucson from the fort. That same day, Sherrod Hunter ordered the evacuation of Tucson. He left ten of his militia behind under the command of Lieutenant James Henry Tevis. Their orders were to observe the Union approach. Capture On May 20, 1862, Captain Emil Fritz with his Company B, 1st California Cavalry Regiment, entered Tucson, not approaching from the west as the Confederates had expected, but from the north and east via the Ca√±ada del Oro. Captain Fritz with part of his company entered from the east side of the town, while Lieutenant Juan F. Guirado with the remainder of the company entered from the north. Lieutenant Tevis, who had been watching the western approach, was completely surprised by Lieutenant Guirado's sudden appearance from the Ca√±ada del Oro, and narrowly avoided capture by the Union forces. Lieutenant Tevis beat a hasty retreat to the south and then east along the old Overland Mail Route in the direction of Mesilla. The California Volunteers secured Tucson without firing a single shot and returned the Stars-and-Stripes to the city after a Confederate occupation that had lasted only 80 days. Aftermath When Captain Hunter arrived in Mesilla on May 27, his company, along with the Arizona Rangers and the Arizona Guards, were formed into Lieutenant Colonel Philemon Herbert's battalion of Arizona Cavalry. The Arizonans ceased being militia and officially became Confederate soldiers under General Henry Sibley. After the Battle of Glorieta Pass and the retreat of General Sibley's army, the Arizona Cavalry battalion was ordered to remain behind to hold on to Mesilla and the surrounding valley. Men under Sherod Hunter fought with New Mexican militia near Mesilla on June 1, 1862. The skirmish ended with no known casualties on either side and reports indicate a Union victory due to the loss of Confederate horses and equipment at the battle, the rebels retreated from Mesilla a few days later. When the Arizona Cavalry withdrew into Texas they were some of the last Confederate soldiers to leave Confederate Arizona. Though the Confederates, due to lack of man power, failed to hold Arizona, the Arizonans themselves achieved their main goal: the creation of a territory separate from that of New Mexico Territory. As mentioned previously, the United States established Arizona Territory with Tucson as the capital in 1863, using a north-south boundary. The towns of Mesilla, Pinos Altos and others were not included in the new Arizona Territory, instead they remained part of New Mexico Territory and are now within the present day state of New Mexico. The Confederate occupation of Arizona prompted a return of Union forces to the region in order to reassert Federal government control, thus providing Arizona the military support necessary for protection against Apaches. Indeed, the California Volunteers remained on guard in Arizona until relieved by the Regular Army of the United States in the spring of 1866, making them the last volunteer forces to be mustered out of Federal service in the American Civil War.

Its four designated population centres are Simcoe, Port Dover, Delhi, and Waterford. Map of Norfolk County from 1877, showing historical townships. The population of the County at the time of the 2016 Census was 64,044. Of that number, 13,922 live in the community of Simcoe. In the late 1900s, the county was merged with Haldimand County but the merged entity was dissolved in 2000 and this area became The Town of the County of Norfolk. Communities=A‚ÄìMAndy's Corners= Andy's Corners () is a small community that is between Wyecombe and Carholme in Norfolk County. Agriculture is the dominant industry and commerce consists of a variety store and a place to buy Volvo automobiles to the east of the hamlet. Most of the clients who buy automobiles from the local Volvo dealership are tobacco farmers and their families. Only Pepsi soft drinks are served at the general store and the population is less than 30 people. The nearest town with a shopping mall is Tillsonburg about 15‚Äì30 minutes to the northwest. Delhi is to the northeast. High school children here go to Valley Heights Secondary School while elementary school students go to Langton Public School. The town's only intersection offers a facilitated way to get to Lynedoch, Silver Hill, Pinegrove, and Delhi. =Atherton= Atherton () is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is in between Gilbertville and Simcoe. The population of Atherton is less than 100 people and there are no sidewalks in the hamlet. The tiny community can be found by exploring on Highway 3 as well as Lynedoch Road which is the other major road that goes into Atherton. The manufacturing plant is located north of Walsh, northeast of Pine Grove, and southeast of Delhi. The hamlet is a farming community with little or no commerce in the area. =Bill's Corners= Bill's Corners () is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is between Green's Corners and Hillcrest. Further to the east is the town of Simcoe, which is the closest town to Bill's Corners. The sole industry in the hamlet is agriculture; abortive attempts were made to have a garage for automobile repair during the 1990s and early 2000s. The hamlet has a population of fewer than 200 people. Walsh Public School provides education for grades JK-8, and Simcoe Composite School provides secondary education. Bill's Corners was one of the last communities in Norfolk County to receive broadband access. A group of local citizens tried to fight this service but failed when Norfolk County council allowed the infrastructure to be installed in Bill's Corners anyway. As of 2014, nobody has petitioned Norfolk County council to remove broadband Internet service from Bill's Corners. One famous previous resident was Dwayne Roloson, who played for six different teams before retiring from the National Hockey League. Roloson currently serves as a goaltending consultant within the Anaheim Ducks organization for the Norfolk Admirals (Norfolk, Virginia). =Blayney= Blayney is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is in between Pine Grove and Green's Corners. Established prior to 1920, it is considered to be one of Norfolk County's lost hamlets. It once hosted its own post office and general store before they were burnt down sometime after 1920. There is no commerce and the cultivation of tobacco is the main industry. The hamlet is formed on the crossroads of Yuell Road and Regional Road 1 (known locally as McDowell Road). On Yuell Road South, there is a house that is almost completely underground. To the northwest is Delhi and to the southeast is Walsh. The nearest gas station is in Pine Grove. Groceries, toiletries, and clothing are purchased from either Simcoe, Delhi, or Tillsonburg. Stores located near Blayney are Wal-Mart, Giant Tiger, Food Basics, Real Canadian Superstore and Sobeys. Rick Danko, a musician and founding member of The Band, has a historical plaque dedicated to him near his childhood home. He performed on a 4-string tenor banjo shortly after entering grade 1. As a child, Danko was hyperactive, but was diagnosed in an era before Ritalin became mainstream.

Although people live there and own real estate, the hamlet is legally described as agriculture land, not residential land to reduce property taxes. Approximately 70 people live in this town amongst the 140 houses. About 9 of the houses have been abandoned due to safety issues from the wind turbines.Consequences of building the wind turbines at Wind Turbine Syndrome.com People have lived in this community as far back as 1901 with some Canadian soldiers from the First World War having been raised in this community.Community information at ePodunk There are no sidewalks for safer pedestrian walking and wind turbines are seen very frequently within the vicinity of Clear Creek; being installed in November 2008.Clear Creek Wind Farm at Canadian Wind Energy Association Norfolk County has banned the placement of new wind turbines after becoming a \\"willing host\\" for them back in 2003. One of the council members were worried about Norfolk County becoming \\"industrialized\\" and \\"unnatural.\\" Many leaders in Norfolk County envision the county as being an agricultural hub for Southern Ontario even by the middle of the 22nd century. The nearest high school is Valley Heights Secondary School which is to the northeast. Students from here grab the same high school bus as the students from Houghton. =Courtland= Former St George Greek Catholic Church Courtland () is a village located in Norfolk County on Highway 3 between Delhi and Tillsonburg. This community was once known as Middleton; named after the more well-known community of Middleton in Nova Scotia. The first settler was Lot Tisdale who arrived in 1823. 917 people live here as of 2009.History information at Rural Routes A 30-hectare certified organic herb farm owned by Garry Proven operates in the area.Comfort Food at ProQuest By the year 2020, Courtland will experience cable television and Internet speeds that are roughly comparable to Delhi's Internet speeds thanks to an underground cable system that will hook up communities like Langton, Port Rowan, and St. Williams into the world of reliable broadband Internet.High- speed Internet coming to Courtland at Simcoe Reformer To the west of the town is a motorcycle shop and a gas station that was once owned by UPI Energy. North Street is the oldest street in the village which runs parallel with the railroad tracks. There are five churches in the village, the oldest being the Lutheran Church. Main Street is the street that has the most commerce and Highway Crescent offers a passageway from the highway for the local residents. In the eastern part of the village, a cul-de-sac community called Talbot Court is being constructed. Sidewalks only exist on the main streets. Otherwise, the walk through Courtland is simple provided that pedestrians pay extra caution to the traffic on the street. Flat terrain exists throughout the entire village; and the village spans approximately 5 kilometres. Recommended activities are hiking, running, and walking. The usage of ATVs, motorcycles, and bicycles are not recommended due to safety concerns. Unlike most communities in Norfolk County, Courtland is entirely accessible for wheelchair users.Courtland Urban Trail informatiion at Ontario Trails The full extent of the service industry in Courtland includes a variety store, an antique store, a \\"bread and pastries\\" type of bakery which has been operating in the community since 1939,Courtland Bakery celebrates 75 years at Simcoe Reformer a family restaurant and a flower shop. Courtland Vinyl Windows and Gopher Dunes are a couple of well-known businesses in the area. A golf course was once located here; it closed on October 16, 2003, due to factors caused by the early 2000s recession. Official tax policy changes made after the 2003 Ontario provincial election worsened the local poverty rate and made people less likely to enjoy golf as a recreational sport. There are also two schools in Courtland; one being a public school and other being a part of the Catholic school system. =Delhi= Delhi (pronounced DEL-High) is located off of the junction of Hwy 59 and 3 and is known as the Heart of Tobacco Country. The settlement was founded by Frederick Sovereign (or Sovereign) who built a cabin here in about 1812. At the time, the area was heavily treed and would become important in the lumber industry. The village was named Sovereign's Corners (or Sovereign's Corners) and later Fredericksburg until the post office opened as Delhi in 1856. Sovereign was a tavern keeper for over 30 years. He also manufactured plug tobacco, growing his own leaves, curing them, and pressing them. He donated the land for the Baptist church and served as deacon for \\"many, many years\\". The population in 1869 was 300 and the village had some manufacturing as well as a lumber mill thanks to the abundant water power. The post office was receiving mail daily. The railway arrived in the 1870s a definite benefit to locals who opened business such as the Delhi Canning Company, established in 1878; the company shipped canned local produce across Canada.http://delhimuseum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Walking-Tour-Early- Settlement.pdf The village initially had a log schoolhouse but a new school was built in 1892. By around 1900, the village had an opera house, two tanneries, a railroad station, an Orange Hall and a Mechanics' Institute as well as a flour mill, the Quance Mills or Sovereign-Quance Mills.http://www.ruralroutes.com/5765.html At the time, the primary crops in the area were still fruit and vegetables. Until 2001, Delhi was located within the Township of Delhi, a municipal government within the Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk. Prior to the amalgamation of Norfolk County, the population of the former Township of Delhi was 16,365 in the Canada 2001 Census Part of the agricultural heritage of Delhi included tobacco cultivation. The town has a tobacco museum to commemorate this part of its history. Local farms rely in part upon Jamaican and Mexican workers, who usually arrive around mid-to-late April and return to their homelands around early-to-mid November. North Creek was once the most important spawning point for the local fish species until it was dammed in 1965. Local fishermen in addition to avid enthusiasts from the region historically fished near the now highly regulated tributaries during the 1940s and 1950s. Today, Big Creek is the main attraction for fishers of all ages. As of 2016, the majority of Delhi's residents speak English as a first language and were born in Canada. Females outnumber males, and working-age people outnumber children and elderly people. Delhi will experience a surge in old age pensioners by the year 2026. Seventy people were born in the United States of America, while 250 were born in Europe. Ten residents were born in Africa, while 20 residents were born in Asia.Further information about the population structure (2016) at City Population Delhi's population is expected to grow to approximately 5,215 residents by 2056, although future wars and pandemics may affect this population growth. People are less likely to have children or emigrate to Canada if there are any major political/medical events happening in the world. =Dog's Nest= Dog's Nest is a community northeast of Port Dover along Highway 6. Have had the sign stolen 3 times and municipality at the time decided not to put the sign back up. There is now a committee not for profit \\"DogsNest 1851\\" formed April 2019 to bring back the sign. They sell t-shirts, hats and merch to raise funds. 100% volunteer driven and 100% proceeds go towards the sign and surrounding area needs. =Fishers Glen= Fishers Glen is a fishing community that is south of Simcoe and southwest of Port Ryerse. It is considered to be a part of Norfolk County.

It is located northwest of Valley Heights Secondary School. Agriculture is the predominant industry while commercial business ventures are non-existent. It is one of the westernmost communities in Norfolk County. This community has a sizeable population of German Mennonites and Mexican Mennonites. Only six wind turbines, carrying approximately 9 MW of electricity have been placed in the vicinity.Frogmore Wind Project at Canadian Wind Energy Association No more can be built in this area due to a county-wide ban on wind turbines passed in 2013. Even without the threat of wind turbines, this community is completely shielded from urban development threats due to its isolation from major communities like Simcoe, Delhi, and Tillsonburg. The popular tourist destination of Port Burwell is just a 30 minutes' drive to the southwest of this community. Another historic community, Sparta, along with the St. Thomas Raceway Park lies 45 minutes to the southwest from Frogmore. =Gilbertville= Gilbertville () is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is located between Pine Grove and Delhi. The local economy is founded on agriculture, which produces potatoes, onions, and asparagus, among other vegetables. Commerce in Gilbertville includes a tractor shop and an auto repair shop. There is a conservation park to the west of the hamlet. For administrative purposes and municipal elections, Gilbertville is considered to be the southernmost community in the third ward of Norfolk County. The founding fathers of Gilbertville all had the last name Gilbert. The hamlet was founded in the 19th century as a hitching stop between Simcoe and Delhi, along with nearby Atherton to the east. During the early 20th century, a military base in Gilbertville was used to house soldiers from the Royal Canadian Army during the First and Second World Wars. It is assumed to be used for civilian purposes since the defunct military base is considered to be private property. Prior to the 21st century, sulphur water was present in Gilbertville, causing a swamp-like stench. The problem eventually disappeared around 2002 due to advances in irrigation technology becoming more affordable to the region. A small creek is found in this hamlet; providing photo opportunities for photographers who are interested in nature scenery. There are no plans for expansion of any kind in Gilbertville. The population has remained relatively the same for more than 50 years. Property taxes are low. Any children who reside in Gilbertville attend Delhi Public School for their elementary education. Secondary education is provided by Delhi District Secondary School for students in the secular system while Holy Trinity Catholic High School in Simcoe provides the secondary school education for students in the Roman Catholic education system. =Glenshee= Glenshee () is a hamlet that is located west of Pinegrove in Norfolk County. The hamlet is mostly agricultural and residential. In addition to farms, there is also a machine shop that serves the local residents. The population is under 20 people and the nearest commerce is in Tillsonburg and Delhi. Glenshee also has an abandoned cemetery that is also known as the Bigcraft Family Cemetery; because it originally held the tombstones for the relatives of the Bigcraft family in addition to close family friends and their in-laws. At least 7 individuals are known to be buried there.Bigcraft Family Cemetery at Find a Grave School children here attend [Delhi District Secondary School or Valley Heights Secondary School] for their high school needs and either Delhi Public School or Walsh Public School for their elementary/junior high school needs. To the southwest is the village of Silver Hill where the nearest car mechanic is based. Terrestrial television and satellite television (either through Bell Satellite TV or Shaw Direct) are the only ways to acquire television service because there is no cable television service in Glenshee. =Green's Corners= Green's Corners is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is located west of Simcoe, north of Walsh, southeast of Delhi, and east of Pine Grove. The population of Green's Corners is less than 50 people. In addition to residential property, there is also agriculture and some commerce. There is a bakery, a bed and breakfast, an automobile garage, and a Christmas tree store. This hamlet was also the hometown of the late musician, Rick Danko of The Band, who enjoyed a remarkable career on and off the stage. A serious crime was committed in this hamlet at approximately 2 am on March 15, 2007. Jack Cousins was beaten up and his wife Carolyn Cousins (n√©e Wooley) was raped by a gang of masked thugs. Police were summoned on the scene complete with sniffer dogs. Talk around the local bakery blamed their son's criminal career with illegal drugs as the reason for this attack. They are a lower middle class couple with no money or valuables in the house. On March 20, 2007, the suspects were captured. They were from Brantford and all three suspects were young males. =Halfway House Corners= Halfway House Corners is a hamlet in Norfolk County. It is considered to be south of Simcoe and northwest of Port Dover. The Halfway House was an inn that sat on the southwest corner of the intersection. The name was given because it was located exactly half the distance between Port Dover and Simcoe. Ontario Highway 24 is the main road and commerce in this community includes a bait shop and a recording studio. =Hillcrest= Hillcrest () is a hamlet in Norfolk County that is in between Bill's Corners and the town of Simcoe. There is also a soccer field; which received a $15,000 stimulus package from the Simcoe Lions Club on April 7, 2013.Simcoe and District Youth Soccer Club Get a Financial Boost at Simcoe Reformer Adult amateur leagues typically do not use this field; with the exception of the Western Ontario Soccer League.Simcoe Thunder Soccer Schedule at Western Ontario Soccer League During the winter months (late November through early April), Hillcrest becomes a haven for snowmobile users. Religious needs for this community are provided either by the Simcoe United Church or the nearby Kingdom Hall for Jehovah's Witnesses (although non- members are welcome as pupils for weekly service). The hamlet and all land that is within to the south are considered to be prime land by local developers; they believe that land should be earmarked for the further expansion of Simcoe. Hillcrest may cease to exist as a separate community and become a \\"neighborhood\\" of Simcoe by the middle of the 21st century. With the recent growth in new housing activity, the area may need to overhaul its water and sewer systems to meet the needs of a rising and aging population of the next several decades. Lands not being used by tobacco farmers either get converted into prime commercial land, prime residential land or get their tobacco crops replaced with other products. A grand total of 991 new low- density houses will have to be built to accommodate the new people. The new buildings could be \\"layered\\" over top of the old buildings; turning houses into makeshift apartment buildings and small stores into multi-floor shopping plazas. Alternate plans may include absorbing Renton, Port Dover and/or Waterford. Municipal planners will have to take into consideration the needs of the Oakwood Cemetery to expand as the current aging population begins to die in massive numbers. =Houghton= Houghton is a former township in Norfolk County. Its township seat was Fairground, a small village today. It is located in the southwest of Norfolk, bordering on the former Norfolk townships of Middleton to the northeast, and North and South Walsingham to the east. Fairground is a small community in Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada where the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show took place in the early 19th century. Until that event was moved to Simcoe, this was the spot where fairgoers attended the attractions and farmers displayed their best produce. The community of Fairground borders on the municipality of Bayham in Elgin County to the west, and its southern border is the Lake Erie shoreline, with no natural harbours. Rising gas prices and pervasive poverty amongst residents prevent many young Houghton residents from going to the Norfolk County Fair near downtown Simcoe; creating a need for a more local fair that lasted since 1853.Small rural fair lives on at The Simcoe Reformer The township was part of Norfolk Township in Regional Municipality of Haldimand-Norfolk from 1974 to 2000. Agriculture dominates as the main industry and there is an elementary school called Houghton Public School in Fairground that serves children from kindergarten through eighth grade. Many families in the region had made Houghton their home since the late 1840s. =Jacksonburg= Jacksonburg () =Langton= Sacred Heart Church Langton () is a small town located in Norfolk County; formerly known as Boughner's Corner. The town can be accessed by travelling to the intersection just slightly to the west of Courtland and turning south on Ontario provincial Highway 59 if coming from Delhi, south if coming from Tillsonburg or if travelling eastbound on Ontario Provincial Highway 3, and straight ahead if travelling southbound using Ontario provincial Highway 59. Langton once had two banks but the CIBC bank closed in May 2016 due to increased online banking activity and the changing Canadian economy; placing the future of offline banking in this community in definite jeopardy.Langton loses bank ‚Äì and a piece of history at Simcoe Reformer Despite its small population, Langton was considered to be a banking hub for the tobacco farmers during the 20th century.BMO to close in Delhi, Langton at Tillsonburg News The Langton Baptist Churchyard is the local cemetery in the area. Having a significant amount of history to it, there are at least 600 individuals who are buried in the cemetery; including people with the last name Boughner because of its closeness to the community of Walsh. The oldest female buried at this cemetery is Rebecca Boughner (who died in 1863) while the oldest male buried in this cemetery is James N. Martin (who died in 1865).Langton Baptist Churchyard at Find a Grave There are at least 5 members of the Millennials generation (born between 1980 and 2005) who are buried at this cemetery.Millennials in Langton Baptist Cemetery Sidewalks exist only on the main street, otherwise, walking in this town is very simple. The entire town spans 5 kilometers in length. Langton enjoys scenery that is very rural and flat. Streets can be busy sometimes; especially during the weekdays. Possible activities include hiking, walking, running, and cycling.Langton Urban Trail at Ontario Trails They have been able to receive cable television service since approximately 2011. Since children of elementary school age who live in Andy's Corners attend Langton Public School or Sacred Heart School, Andy's Corners is considered to be a subdivision of Langton. Langton was home to the Langton Thunderbirds, a junior hockey team that played in the Southern Ontario Junior Hockey League. Langton has two schools: Langton Public School and Sacred Heart Catholic School. =La Salette= La Salette Historic Church La Salette is a hamlet that is north of Delhi in Norfolk County, Ontario, Canada. La Salette is southwest of Brantford in nearby Brant County and northwest of Simcoe. Agriculture is the main industry and commerce is extremely limited. Most of the houses in La Salette are over 100 years old and the population of La Salette is less than 100 people. =Long Point= Long Point is a sand spit and medium-sized hamlet on the north shore of Lake Erie, part of Norfolk County. It is about long and is about a kilometre across at its widest point. Lake Erie lies to the south of Long Point, and the waters to the north side comprise Long Point Bay. The bay is subdivided into the Inner Bay and Outer Bay by a line that runs between Turkey Point to the north and Pottahawk Point to the south. Some of the towns along the bay's north shore include Port Rowan, Turkey Point and Port Dover. Long Point is north and across the lake from Erie, Pennsylvania. Settlers from Europe began arriving in this area in 1790. After the American Revolution, many Loyalists began to settle here but after 1796, land was given to anyone who was capable of developing it. The first lighthouse was built in 1830. The recently renovated Old Cut Lighthouse. In the 19th century, a powerful storm cut an opening through the middle of Long Point. A lighthouse was built alongside the channel, which was the first of several on the point. The opening became known as \\"The Old Cut\\". The cut has since closed along the lakeshore, but boaters continue to use the northern portion to access the bay, homes and cottages. During the mid-19th century, some of the local residents saw an opportunity to make easy money by \\"blackbirding.\\" Blackbirders erected fake lighthouses during times of low visibility. Ships trying to enter the old cut would run aground. When the crew abandoned ship the blackbirders would loot the ship of cargo and other valuables. With law enforcement based in London, Ontario, these blackbirders would store their loot on the many hiding spots that Long Point offered. Abigail Becker on several occasions in the 19th century waded into stormy waters to save crew members of boats that had run aground. Long Point has caused many shipwrecks, with many of wrecks are right off the tip of the point. More than 400 ships have sunk in an area called \\"The Lake Erie Quadrangle\\". Sport hunting was important after the Long Point Company purchased the Point in 1866 to facilitate this pursuit. Long Point Provincial Park was created in May 1921; by 1929, it was connected to the mainland by a new causeway. =Lynedoch= Lynedoch () is a hamlet in Norfolk County which was named after Baron Lynedoch who served under Wellington during the Napoleonic Wars.

There is an airfield, some farms, and a single office building that is dedicated to an agriculture-related business in the hamlet where Nixon Public School used to be. Nixon is east of the town of Delhi, northwest of the town of Simcoe, and northeast of the hamlet of Pinegrove. Plans are currently underway for a microbrewery to open in the community; beers and wines that emulate those found in Belgium and the Netherlands will be manufactured here. Producing very little noise or steam pollution, the microbrewery will bolster the economy of Norfolk County. Trappist beers will be brewed on site for the purpose of getting the higher-class members of Norfolk County to spend money more locally.Microbrewery Coming to Nixon at The Simcoe Reformer The municipal government approved the rezoning of the surrounding land to \\"light industrial\\" for Norfolk County's third microbrewery to be possible according to the local by-laws.Third microbrewery coming to Norfolk County at Norfolk Farms This community is the westernmost community to receive water from the Lynn River; which flows directly into Lake Erie. Beers and wines produced in the Nixon microbrewery will use the Lynn River as a source of their water. =Normandale= Normandale () is a quaint fishing town in southwestern Norfolk County that is famous for its perch and black bass. This settlement was part of Charlotteville where Fort Norfolk was built in 1813 with accommodation for 300 troops. A large iron foundry, the Normandale Furnace and Ironworks was built here in 1817 and was expanded in 1822; it made farm implements, the well-known Van Norman stoves as well as kettles, pots, and pans but closed down in 1847 or 1850. Commerce is extremely limited now and agriculture plays a smaller role than in other parts of Norfolk County. Normandale has a historical cemetery located on Spooky Hollow Road which has at least 288 individuals buried there.Normandale Cemetery at Find a Grave =Pinegrove= Prior to the late 1970s, much of Pine Grove was agricultural land owned by the Adcock family. After the family patriarch died circa 1978, the land was distributed amongst his sons and the first housing boom in Pine Grove occurred. Three-quarters of present day Pine Grove were completed by the mid 1980s. In the 1980s, children needing special education attended Nixon Public School and North Public School. Both of these schools are defunct and are no longer operating as of 2007. Starting in 1991, they could attend Walsh Public School under their special education program. Sidewalks were never built in order to attract people to this hamlet with low property taxes. No further construction was done in Pine Grove until circa 2002. While the weak Canadian dollar and low interest rates brought in 3 new single-family homes to the recently formed cul-de-sac of Woodland Drive, expansion has been slowed down by the rising interest rates and a strengthening Canadian dollar - construction of a fourth single-family home only started circa October 2007. A defunct Baptist church and cemetery can be found in Pine Grove. Although the original grave markers remain and can be publicly viewed, the former church building is now a private residence. Entering the residence without an invitation will result in criminal trespassing charges and prosecution. The defunct cemetery is located in between the gas station and the car repair shop. The grave markers are remarkably old and date back to the 19th century. Shortly after Norfolk County became a single tier municipality, the location of the cemetery was given the distinctive green Norfolk County sign for historical sites and parks. The gas station was once owned by a local couple and has serviced the area for decades. They briefly brought in a miniature video arcade to the convenience store part prior to 1982. However, it was removed when the locals found it to be too noisy. After the husband died in the mid 1990s, his widow operated the store until her death sometime prior to the year 2004. The gas station was eventually sold to a couple from Toronto who eventually sold it to someone else years later. In addition to gasoline and food, the convenience store also provides lottery tickets and offers a large selection of products within a small space. On June 4, 2007, a series of blackouts affected Pine Grove that was caused by a transformer that was on fire. The first one was from approximately 11:00 A.M. to 11:30 A.M which forced the Norfolk County Fire Department to arrive to the scene without having to close Regional Road 1. Even though the fire was extinguished and the transformer was patched, the patch was only temporary as the fire eventually resumed almost 7 hours later at approximately 7:00 P.M. This caused another blackout that lasted until approximately 11:00 P.M.. This blackout however did not affect Green's Corners, Hillcrest, or Simcoe. Ontario Hydro crews worked on replacing the transformer without the Ontario Provincial Police having to close down Regional Road 1. The total blackout period for the day was approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes (270 minutes). =Port Dover= In 1670, French missionaries Fran√ßois Dollier de Casson and Ren√© Br√©hant de Galin√©e became the first Europeans to winter at what is now Port Dover. Earthen remains and a plaque marks the spot near the fork of the Lynn River (Patterson's Creek to many of the older Port Doverites) and Black Creek where they and seven Frenchmen (the first Europeans known to have ascended the Great Lakes to Sault Ste. Marie) built a hut and chapel. Just outside the community, a cross with the arms of France had been erected on 23 March 1670, claiming the area for King Louis XIV over the Lake Erie region. By 1794 the first settlers, a group of United Empire Loyalists, had established a hamlet known as Dover Mills (named for the English port of Dover) which was razed to the ground by the Americans in the War of 1812. During the war, in August 1812, Major General Isaac Brock gathered a force of about regulars and militia here. Using boats on the lake, they reached Amherstburg (also in Upper Canada) and then attacked and captured the American Hull's Army at Detroit. Subsequent reconstruction took place closer to the mouth of the Lynn River, where a harbour had been in use since the early 19th century. In 1835, merchant Israel Wood Powell registered a village plan for Port Dover. By 1842, the village was growing and had a population of almost 400. The harbor, lighthouse, and bridge across the river had been completed as had the road to Hamilton; there was a grammar school, a grist mill, a sawmill and a Presbyterian church in the course of construction. Improvement to the harbour during the next fifteen years made Port Dover a principal Lake Erie port. Shipyards, tanneries, and Andrew Thompson's woolen-mill contributed substantially to local economic growth. In 1877, Port Dover was a large village with 1,100 residents, most living on the west bank of the River Lynn. The village was served by the Port Dover & Lake Huron Railway and a more substantial harbor had been completed. Records indicate that businesses include a foundry, many stores, a newspaper, wagon and carriage makers, and a busy school house. Port Dover became an incorporated village in 1879. Fishing became a major industry in the 20th century and Port Dover also became a tourist destination. Port Dover's fishing industry at one time hosted the largest freshwater fishing fleet in the world that employed many of the town's citizens and continues to be important to the community. From 1906 to 1993, the town was home to Thomas A. Ivey and Sons, one of Canada's largest wholesale florists and rose-growers, and Port Dover's largest employer. In 1974, Port Dover was incorporated as Ward 2 of the former city of Nanticoke. Willie's Restaurant in Port Dover on Friday, August 13, 2004.

One of the most traditional businesses is The Arbor that sells cherry glows instead of soft drinks and hot dogs served on thick pieces of hot dogs buns in addition to French fries. The Port Dover Yacht Club has occupied land purchased from W.F. Kolbe and Co. at the fork of the Lynn River and Black Creek since September 1938. The P.D.Y.C. welcomes visitors every summer from around the Great Lakes region and beyond. Port Dover has celebrated Canada Day with a parade every year since July 1867. The day starts off with the annual Soap-box Derby, the Boat Parade at the harbour, a Calithumpian Parade down Main Street and a fireworks display after dark. Since 1981, there has been a tradition of motorcycle enthusiasts gathering in the town for Friday the 13th. Chris Simons and approximately 25 friends, through word of mouth, got together at the old Commercial Hotel. It was in November and it was Friday the 13th. They decided they should do it every Friday the 13th. On June 13, 2008, an estimated 150,000 bikers and spectators converged on Port Dover for Friday the 13th. =Port Rowan= Port Rowan () holds an annual Bayfest every Labour Day; this used to be known as \\"Tomato Fest\\" but was renamed a few years ago.

In 1845, Port Rowan was very small, with only 50 residents but had a store, tavern, post office and a collector of customs who worked with the shipping trade. Lumber became important between 1845 and 1850 so the population increased to 100 by 1845 and to 200 by 1850. By 1877, Port Rowan had about 1,000 residents, many living in beautiful homes overlooking the lake. It was a successful commercial and industrial centre for those who lived in the general area. Fishing had also started and would continue through the 1900s. The village had three churches, a public hall, a Masonic Hall and a Temperance Hall. A state of the art water treatment plant was built in 2011, which assures future growth capacity in the town along with its rapidly aging population. There are wind generators in the Port Rowan area; which stretch out to Clear Creek and the Elgin County line. This community is the westernmost and the southernmost to participate in the Southern Ontario's Green Energy Hub. Located just outside of town off Lakeshore Rd. is the famous Backus Mill, where every year there is a re-enactment of the War of 1812. This site was the location of a grain mill built by John Backhouse in the 1790s and was powered by water. The mill's mechanism was upgraded later in the 1800 and then in the early 1900s. =Port Ryerse= Port Ryerse () is a fishing hamlet in Norfolk County just slightly southwest of Port Dover where people from Southwestern Ontario rent cottages and fish for pleasure during the summer months (Victoria Day through mid-October). The hamlet was founded by Lieut-Colonel Samuel Ryerse, brother of Colonel Joseph Ryerson and uncle of Egerton Ryerson.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/41309837 Its harbor was important for shipping cargo from Norfolk County across the lake.

He built a grist mill at the mouth of Young's Creek and a settlement grew up around it. Ryerse remained involved with the military as Lieutenant of the County of Norfolk and was also the chairman of the Court of Quarter Sessions. The mill was burned by American troops in 1814 during the War of 1812. In later years, two new gristmills were built at the same location but both burned down (in 1860 and in 1890). A brick schoolhouse was built in 1871. The Memorial Anglican Church Cemetery is located in the hamlet; with at least 26 individuals or families buried here. The cemetery contains tombstones from the 19th century and carries traditional British surnames like Fletcher, Lawrence, Ryerse, Sells, and Stalker.

Most of the people here drive to Port Dover or Simcoe to purchase groceries and other goods, although there was a historic general store until September 2004, when it burned down. Handmade soap and bath shop and folk art shop still exist in the community. Port Ryerse is also the birthplace of John Edward Brownlee, who was the Premier of the province of Alberta during the roaring twenties and through the early years of the Great Depression.

Directed by Fritz Kiersch, the film's cast consists of Peter Horton, Linda Hamilton, John Franklin, Courtney Gains, Robby Kiger, Anne Marie McEvoy, Julie Maddalena, and R. G. Armstrong. Set in the fictitious rural town of Gatlin, Nebraska, the film tells the story of a malevolent entity referred to as \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\" which entices the town's children to ritually murder all the town's adults, and a couple driving across the country, to ensure a successful corn harvest. King wrote the original draft of the screenplay, which focused more on the characters of Burt and Vicky and depicted more history on the uprising of the children in Gatlin. This script was disregarded in favor of George Goldsmith's screenplay, which featured more violence and a more conventional narrative structure. Filming took place mainly in Iowa, but also in California. It spawned a franchise of films, and it has gained a cult following.  Plot  The film is set in the fictional town of Gatlin, Nebraska, an agricultural community surrounded by huge cornfields. In 1980, the town appears to be neglected except for the church, and residents choose Biblical names over more modern ones. When the corn crop fails one year, the townsfolk turn to prayer to ensure a successful harvest. However, 12-year-old Isaac Chroner takes all of the children in Gatlin into the cornfields and indoctrinates them into a religious cult based around a bloodthirsty deity called ‚ÄúHe Who Walks Behind the Rows‚Äù. Isaac and his subordinate, 18-year-old Malachi, lead the children in a revolution, murdering all of the adults (ages 19 and up, since 18-year- olds are seen as halfway between teenager and adult) in town as human sacrifices, poisoning and butchering them. Only Job and his sister Sarah, are not involved, as Sarah was sick and Job was not allowed to attend the meetings in the corn with the other children. It is revealed in the opening credits that Sarah has visions, which are portrayed through the credits via drawings. Three years later, on October 31, 1983, Vicky Baxter and her boyfriend Burt Stanton travel through rural Nebraska on their way to Seattle, where Burt will start working as a physician. Elsewhere, a young boy named Joseph tries to flee Gatlin, but is attacked in the corn; he stumbles out into the road and Burt accidentally runs him over with his car. However, Burt discovers that his throat was cut beforehand. Burt and Vicky place Joseph and his suitcase in their trunk and search for a phone to call for help. They find elderly mechanic Diehl, the last adult in Gatlin, but he refuses them service; he is in an agreement to supply the children with fuel in exchange for his life. But the merciless Malachi breaks the pact and murders him, against Isaac's wishes, when Diehl tries to steer the couple away from Gatlin. Vicky and Burt explore the abandoned town and find Sarah alone in a house; while Vicky stays with her, Burt searches the town. Malachi and his followers appear, capture Vicky, and take her to the cornfield, where they place her on a cross to be sacrificed. Burt enters the church, where a congregation of children led by a girl named Rachel are performing a cultural birthday ritual for Amos by drinking his blood from a pentagram-shaped cut on his body. Amos has turned 19, so is considered old enough for his \\"passing\\"‚Äîjoining their god in the cornfield. Burt scolds the children for participating in a blood ritual and an enraged Rachel stabs Burt then Malachi and the others chase him. Job rescues Burt and they hide in a fallout shelter with Sarah, where they learn Vicky was captured, and agree to help him rescue her. The zealous Isaac scolds Malachi for his treachery in killing Diehl, their only source of fuel. Malachi, tired of Isaac's preaching, takes over, ordering Isaac to be sacrificed instead of Vicky. Isaac warns Malachi that sacrificing him will break their pact with He Who Walks Behind the Rows and the children will be severely punished. That night, Burt sneaks into the cornfield to rescue Vicky. During Isaac's sacrifice, a supernatural light appears and devours the screaming Isaac. Burt emerges and fights Malachi. After pushing him to the ground, Burt convinces the children to abandon the cult and run for safety. But Isaac suddenly reappears, revived by He Who Walks Behind the Rows. He tells Malachi that the deity is angered over him being sacrificed. Informing Malachi that He Who Walks Behind the Rows wants his sacrifice too for his betrayal, Isaac seizes and kills the terrified Malachi by breaking his neck. A storm appears over the cornfield, and Burt and Vicky shelter the children in a barn. Burt reads a passage in the Bible Job gives him; Job also reveals that the police officer tried to set up the gasohol to stop He Who Walks Behind The Rows, but Malachi murdered him before he could finish. Vicky rereads the passage and realizes that the cornfield must be destroyed by fire in order to stop the false god. Burt sprays the cornfield with gasohol and tosses a Molotov cocktail into the field, setting it alight and destroying the demon along with Isaac. Vicky, Burt, Job, and Sarah return to the car to leave Gatlin, but find it disabled. Rachel attacks Burt, but Vicky knocks her out with the car door. He is worried about just leaving her there, but Vicky quips that they will send her a get- well card from Seattle, and they depart with the kids.

Hal Roach executives did not want to use King's script and George Goldsmith was hired to rewrite it. Goldsmith says King's script started with 35 pages of Burt and Vicky arguing in a car, so he decided to tell the story visually through the eyes of two new characters, children Job and Sarah. King was unhappy with the changes but Hal Roach went with Goldsmith. King and Goldsmith debated Goldsmith's approach during a phone conversation during which King argued that Goldsmith did not understand the horror genre and Goldsmith countered that King did not recognize that film is a visual, \\"external\\" experience unlike novels and short stories, which are \\"internal\\" and only visual in the reader's mind. Goldsmith credited King with being extremely gracious when asked about the film in media interviews, stating in diplomatic ways he felt the new approach to be lacking. Hal Roach eventually sold the project to New World Pictures who decided to go with Goldsmith's script, although they tried unsuccessfully to remove his name from the credits in favor of King's. After release of the highly successful film, Goldsmith revealed that much of the story was a metaphor for the revolution in Iran, with the takeover of the town by quasi-religious zealots acting for an evil \\"God\\" based on the Ayatollah Khomeini and his revolutionary guard taking over Iran. Burt and Vicky became analgous to the American hostages and Goldsmith was using a horror film to expose the dangers and evils of religious fundamentalism, something few critics recognized. reference refers to Blood Frenzy Release=Critical response On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Children of the Corn holds a 36% approval rating based on 25 critic reviews, with an average rating of 3.98/10. The consensus reads: \\"Children of the Corn's strong premise and beginning gets shucked away for a kiddie thriller that runs in circles.‚Äù\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun Times awarded the film 1/4 stars, writing, \\"By the end of Children of the Corn, the only thing moving behind the rows is the audience, fleeing to the exits.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \\"As such movies go, Children of the Corn is fairly entertaining, if you can stomach the gore and the sound of child actors trying to talk in something that might be called farmbelt biblical.\\" Ian Nathan from Empire Magazine gave the film 3/5 stars, commending the film's originality, but criticized the film's obvious budgetary constraints, poor effects, and \\"ludicrous monster movie denouement\\". TV Guide awarded the film 1/5 stars, calling it \\"lame\\" and criticized the film's \\"gratuitous visual style\\". Rolling Stone ranked the film at #7 in their list of \\"Top 30 Stephen King Movies\\", calling it \\"a lean, brutally tense slasher film\\".  Remake and prequel  In June 2008, it was confirmed that Donald P. Borchers would begin writing and directing a TV remake of the first film, which would premiere on the Syfy channel. Production began in August, filming in Davenport, Iowa; however, it was later moved to Lost Nation, Iowa. The cast included David Anders, Kandyse McClure, Preston Bailey, Daniel Newman and Alexa Nikolas. The movie aired on September 26, 2009, and the DVD was released on October 6, 2009, by Anchor Bay. The television remake closely follows the original storyline present in the short story, and not that of the original film. Another remake was confirmed in 2020, this time was directed by Kurt Wimmer and produced by Lucas Foster and was filmed in Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also reported that the new film is not a remake, but instead served as a prequel to the 1984 film.  In popular culture  An audio clip of the character Isaac yelling \\"Don't you sit there, seize him, punish him, cut him down! I command you!\\" is used at the end of the song \\"Scream for Silence\\" in Children of Bodom's 2013 album Halo of Blood. In the South Park episode \\"The Wacky Molestation Adventure\\", Cartman shouts the line \\"Outlander! Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives!\\" as a reference to the film.

The story is about a couple who end up in an abandoned Nebraska town that is inhabited by a cult of murderous children who worship a demon that lives in the nearby cornfields. The story has been adapted into several films, spawning a horror feature film franchise beginning in 1984. Plot Burt and Vicky, a couple trying to save their marriage, are driving to California for a vacation and to visit Vicky's brother. As they are driving through rural Nebraska and arguing, they accidentally run over a young boy who had his throat slit and was thrown into the road. They open his suitcase to find a crucifix made of twisted corn husks. They decide to report the incident to the police, place the body in their car's trunk, and go to the nearest town (a small, isolated community called Gatlin) to look for help. As they are driving, Burt tries to listen to the radio. He can only pick up on a station that has a child preacher delivering a fire and brimstone sermon. When they arrive in Gatlin, it appears to be deserted. They do not see any cars or people anywhere. After driving past a gas station and visiting a diner, they notice that several things (such as gas/menu prices and calendar dates) are very outdated. Vicky, who does not like the town, starts to get nervous and asks if they can leave. Burt decides to explore the church after seeing that its property has been maintained, as well as last Sunday's date on the sign. As they argue, Vicky threatens to drive off and leave him stranded. He steals her keys and leaves her locked in the car as she begins to panic. She begs him to come back, but he ignores her. Inside, Burt finds that someone has torn the lettering off the walls and created a strange mosaic of Jesus behind the altar, as well as ripping out the keys and stops of the pipe organ and stuffing its pipes with corn husks. At the altar, Burt finds a King James Bible (with several pages from the New Testament cut out), and a ledger where names have been recorded, along with birth and death dates. While reading the ledger, he notices that all names were changed from modern to Biblical ones, and that everyone listed as deceased died on their 19th birthday. Burt realizes that the children of Gatlin killed the town's adults and that members of their community are not allowed to live past their 19th birthday. After hearing the car's horn, Burt runs from the church to find the car surrounded by a gang of children and teenagers dressed in Amish-style clothing and armed with farm tools. They destroy the windows and windshield, slash the tires, and drag Vicky out. Burt tries to intervene, but a redheaded teen boy stabs him in the arm. Burt pulls the knife out and stabs the boy in the throat. The children step back in shock. Burt then realizes that Vicky is gone. When he asks where she is, one of the children holds up a knife and makes a slashing motion. The children chase Burt, but he manages to outrun them and ducks into the cornfield and hides while they search for him. He notices that there are no animals or weeds in the cornfield and that every stalk of corn is blemish- free. As the sun sets, Burt gets lost and wanders around until he finds a circle of empty ground in the middle of the cornfield and discovers Vicky's body. She has been tied to a cross with barbed wire and her eyes have been ripped out, her eye sockets filled with corn silk, and her mouth stuffed with corn husks. He also sees the crucified skeletons of Gatlin's minister and police chief; the latter is wearing a blue uniform. When Burt turns around to flee, he notices that every row in the cornfield has closed up, creating a wall that prevents him from escaping. He realizes that something is coming for him, but before he can do anything, he is killed by a giant, green, red-eyed monster that comes out of the cornfield. Soon after, a harvest moon appears in the sky. The next day, the children of Gatlin (all members of a pagan cult that worships \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\", a demonic entity that inhabits the cornfields surrounding the town) have a meeting in the circle. Isaac, their 9-year-old leader, tells them that He Who Walks Behind the Rows is displeased with their sacrifice because they failed to also kill Burt. The same thing happened with the \\"blue man\\" and the \\"false minister\\" many years ago. He Who Walks Behind the Rows punishes this failure by lowering the \\"age of favor\\" to 18. He also commands the children to \\"be fruitful and multiply\\". That night, Malachi (the killer of the boy who was run over) and all of the other 18-year-olds walk into the cornfield to sacrifice themselves to He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Ruth, a girl who is pregnant with Malachi's child, weeps as she waves goodbye to him. It is revealed that she secretly hates He Who Walks Behind the Rows and dreams of setting fire to the cornfield, but is afraid to actually do so because He Who Walks Behind the Rows can see everything, including the secrets inside human hearts. The story ends by saying that the corn surrounding Gatlin is pleased. Connections to other books Gatlin was mentioned in It. Hemingford Home, a neighboring town to Gatlin, was also the town where Mother Abagail lived and rounded up the good survivors of the super flu in The Stand, and was also the location of \\"The Last Rung on the Ladder\\" and \\"1922\\". Film series and adaptations The story was first adapted into a 1983 short film, Disciples of the Crow. A year later, the story was adapted into a larger-budget film re-adopting the original name, Children of the Corn, starring Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton. Several sequels and a remake followed. In September 2009, the Syfy channel premiered a television film version which is based on King's short story.

Design and construction The design of a new structure to replace the old ruined castle of Poppelsdorf commenced in 1715 at the request of the owner, Joseph Clemens, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, who engaged the French architect Robert de Cotte. Clemens wanted a maison de plaisance that would be near his remodeled Bonn Palace to the north. There was to be a canal between the two, following the example of the Palace of Versailles and the Trianon de Marbre.Neuman 1994, pp. 83‚Äì86. De Cotte himself never travelled to Bonn to inspect the site, and on 24 May 1715 Clemens wrote to him: \\"I received your project for my Maison de Poppelsdorf, which pleased me infinitely, and I know nothing more beautiful or better conceived, but we are now obliged to consider the site on which it must be built.\\"Quoted and translated in Neuman 1994, pp. 82‚Äì83. No drawing exists of the plan for De Cotte's first project, but letters and subsequent plans indicate that it was square with two axes of symmetry at right angles to one another. It consisted of four two-storey wings surrounding a circular inner court with an arcaded gallery on its circumference. Clemens considered the plan too ambitious and asked de Cotte's assistant in Bonn, Beno√Æt de Fortier, to revise the plan, reducing three of the wings to one storey, but leaving the garden wing with two. Clemens wrote to de Cotte: \\"I realized that it would be quite useless to erect so large a building on that site, which is but a cannon shot from town‚Ä¶. For the most part my retinue returns to the city at night, and I keep near me only those who are absolutely necessary to serve me.\\"Quoted and translated in Neuman 1994, p. 84. The extant plan shows a square entrance vestibule with 16 columns: four free-standing, and the remainder engaged with the walls. The vestibule leads to the circular gallery, on the opposite side of which is a doorway leading into the main domed salon on the garden front. To the left of the salon is the elector's apartment arranged as an enfilade of grande salle, chambre d'audience, chambre √† coucher (bedroom), and a cabinet. To the right of the salon is the salle √† manger (dining room). The chapel is located in the center of the right wing, while the right front quadrant houses the kitchens and the concierge, and the left front quadrant, the stables. Minor rooms, stairs, and a loo occupy the corners between circular gallery and the main rooms in the garden side, and the corresponding spaces on the entrance side provide courtyards for the kitchens and the stables. Models for this type of plan of a country house with an interior circular courtyard include the Villa Madama, Rome (begun c. 1516), and the Villa Farnese, Caprarola (begun 1559). Work came to a halt after Clemens' death in 1723, but his nephew and heir, Archbishop of Cologne Clemens August, undertook a second campaign of construction in 1745‚Äì1746. Subsequent history Under the Prussian rule, in 1818 the Palace and the nearby Park became part of the University of Bonn. In the same year the Park was converted to the Botanical Garden of Bonn, which today contains about 0.5 hectares of greenhouse area with eleven greenhouses and about 8.000 different plants. In 1944 the Palace was heavily damaged by an Allied air attack. It has been rebuilt in a much simpler appearance from 1955 on.

Humorist Will Rogers referred to it as the Powder Puff Derby, the name by which the race is most commonly known. Nineteen pilots took off from Santa Monica, California on August 18, 1929 (another left the next day). Marvel Crosson died, in a crash apparently caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, but fifteen made it to Cleveland, Ohio, nine days later.  The race = Background  During the first two decades of heavier-than-air flying, the few women fliers in the United States became acquainted with one another during air meets and air rodeos. The bonds among the top women pilots were strengthened in the first real race for female pilots‚Äîthe Women‚Äôs Air Derby during the 1929 National Air Races and Aeronautical Exposition. Air-race promoter Cliff Henderson was the founder of the first Women‚Äôs Air Derby, which he patterned after the men‚Äôs transcontinental air races. (Ironically, Henderson would ban women from competing in the 1934 Bendix Trophy and National Air Races after a crash which claimed the life of pilot Florence Klingensmith in 1933.) To qualify, pilots had to have at least 100 hours of solo flight, which included a minimum 25 hours of cross-country flying (these were the same rules that applied to men competing in the National Air Races). The twenty competitors, eighteen of whom were from the United States, were: *Florence \\"Pancho\\" Lowe Barnes *Marvel Crosson *Amelia Earhart *Ruth Elder *Claire Mae Fahy *Edith Foltz *Mary Haizlip *Jessie Miller, an Australian *Opal Kunz *Mary von Mach *Ruth Nichols *Blanche W. Noyes *Gladys O‚ÄôDonnell *Phoebe Omlie *Neva Paris *Margaret Perry *Thea Rasche, a German *Louise Thaden *Evelyn \\"Bobbi\\" Trout *Vera Dawn Walker One of the qualifications was that the aircraft would have to have horsepower \\"appropriate for a woman.\\" Opal Kunz's 300-horsepower Travel Air was deemed to be \\"too fast for a woman to fly\\" (even though she owned and flew it), so she had to find a less powerful aircraft to race.  Route  The pilots, fourteen in the heavy plane class (with engines from 510-875 cubic in.) and six in the lighter class (275-510 cubic in.), took off from Santa Monica, California. Stops en route to Cleveland included San Bernardino, California; Yuma, Arizona; Phoenix, Arizona; Douglas, Arizona; El Paso, Texas; Pecos, Texas; Midland, Texas; Abilene, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; St. Louis, Missouri; and Cincinnati, Ohio. At each stop, the pilots often overnighted for refueling, repairs, and to be treated to media attention and dinner banquets.The Powder Puff Derby ‚Äî Historic Wings Flight Stories. Retrieved March 27, 2019.  Airborne  To keep all competing aircraft safely separated as they climbed to altitude, they were lined up in rows at the start of the race and took off at one-minute intervals, the lighter aircraft first. National Aeronautic Association official Joe Nikrent was the official timekeeper. Earhart had an electrical problem and had to return to the airfield, but repairs were made quickly, and she resumed flying. Marvel Crosson crashed in the Gila River Valley and was killed, apparently the victim of carbon monoxide poisoning. There was a public outcry demanding the race be canceled, but the pilots got together and decided the most fitting tribute would be to finish the derby. Blanche Noyes had to put out a fire that erupted in mid-air over Pecos, but continued on. (In the 2010 documentary Breaking Through the Clouds: The First Women's National Air Derby, Noyes, a non-smoker, explained that she found a cigarette butt in her baggage compartment.) Margaret Perry caught typhoid fever. Pancho Barnes crashed into a car that drove onto the runway as she was trying to land, wrecking her airplane. Ruth Nichols also crashed. Claire Fahy's wing wires were eaten through, possibly sabotaged with acid; she withdrew from the race. An estimated 18,000 people gathered in Cleveland, Ohio, to greet the pilots at the end of the race. Louise Thaden finished the race first and won the heavy class in a time of 20 hours, 19 minutes and 4 seconds. Phoebe Omlie won the light class in 25 hours, 12 minutes and 47.5 seconds. Standings Heavy class: #Louise Thaden #Gladys O‚ÄôDonnell #Amelia Earhart #Blanche Noyes #Ruth Elder #Neva Paris #Mary Haizlip #Opal Kunz #Mary von Mach #Vera Dawn Walker Four women completed the race in the light class (order unclear, other than Omlie finishing first): *Phoebe Omlie *Edith Foltz *Jessie Keith-Miller *Thea Rasche Bobbi Trout finished the race, but was untimed. Depictions The race was the subject of the 1935 novel Women in the Wind: A Novel of the Women's National Air Derby by Francis Walton and the 1939 film adaptation, starring Kay Francis. The book The Powder Puff Derby of 1929: The First All Women's Transcontinental Air Race, written by Gene Nora Jessen, was published in 2002. The 2010 documentary Breaking through the Clouds: The First Women's National Air Derby covers the race from inception through conclusion, includes interviews with some surviving relatives of pilots, and offers short biographies of some of the women.

Green's Block is located in Woodbury, Gloucester County, New Jersey, United States. The building was built in 1880 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 25, 2001. Earthquake damage Following the 2011 Virginia earthquake the vacant building and attached structures, which were also vacant, were ruled structurally unsafe. The sidewalk in front of the building as well as the adjoining streets were fenced off by the City of Woodbury. Due to several liens placed on the building and against the owner, the decision on what to do with the building fell to the City. Estimates to demolish the building ranged as high as $950,000. Woodbury City reached out to developers to take control of the property. A deal was struck with the RPM Development Group to repair the building, turn the ground floor into retail space, and construct age restricted apartments on the upper floors.

Distribution and habitat These species are very common among the Japanese gastropod fauna on rocks and boulders in the intertidal zone of Japanese waters and adjacent islands. Description The shape of the thin shell is limpet-like or patelliform. It has a medium size and has a low to medium height. The base (the aperture) has an oval shape and is longer than wide. The color of the shell is greenish brown and characteristically bedecked with granules of fine radial riblets. . The interior is greenish blue and has a shining luster. The thin and broad interior shell margin exhibits a distinct color and texture from the adjoining area. The shell is constituted of five layers of different structure, while the genus Notoacmea has six layers. The gill is flaplike with a bipectinate ctenidium situated in the nuchal cavity and lacks secondary pallial gills. The radula has typically three pairs of lateral teeth and one pair of marginal teeth that is either lacks any function or is degenerated with growth or is lacking from the beginning. Species Until 1993 the species of these Japanese limpets were allocated in the genus Notoacmea. They were reassigned based on different anatomical characters and shell structure and their endemism to the Japonic zoogeographical province (Japanese waters and adjacent island chains). There wasn't just enough similarity with the New Zealand species from Notoacmea. Also the radula characters were different. Lindberg (in 1986) had pointed out that the genus Notoacmea was restricted to species from New Zealand and Australia and that the North American species belonged in Tectura. The eight Japanese species had been unsettled until this study. Some authors consider them color variations, others regard them as subspecies or as independent species. Species within the genus Nipponacmea include: * Nipponacmea concinna (Lischke, 1870) * Nipponacmea fuscoviridis (Teramachi, 1949) * Nipponacmea gloriosa (Habe, 1944) * Nipponacmea habei (Saski & Okutani, 1994) * Nipponacmea moskalevi Chernyshev & Chernova, 2002 * Nipponacmea nigrans (Kira, 1961) * Nipponacmea radula (Kira, 1961) * Nipponacmea schrenckii (Lischke, 1868) * Nipponacmea teramachii (Kira, 1961) * Nipponacmea vietnamensis Chernyshev, 2008 References Category:Lottiidae ","title":"Nipponacmea"},{"id":"26946452","text":"Niveotectura is a genus of sea snails, the true limpets, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Lottiidae.

He studied at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure where he wrote a doctoral thesis entitled Th√©orie de l'invention published in 1881. In his thesis, he argues that inventions are not the result of a rigorous scientific method but rather come as a deterministic consequence of a set of conditions in which the inventor lives. This theory was contested very soon after its publication in the 1882 edition of the Revue Internationale de l'Enseignement.Soci√©t√© de l'enseignement sup√©rieur (1882) Revue internationale de l'enseignement, Volume 3, G. Masson, ed. Also in 1882 his wife gave birth to √âtienne Souriau, who also became a philosopher in aesthetics. The French thesis was created simultaneously with a Latin thesis titled De motus perceptione. The Latin thesis emphasized the importance of vision in movement perception, hence the initial title De visione motus.Guyard MM. S., Havet L., Monod G., Paris G. (1882) Revue critique d'histoire et de litt√©rature, Volume 1, Ernest Leroux, ed. The thesis was a precursor for his later works on movement perception. He became a professor at the Facult√© des Lettres de Lille (now University of Lille) very soon after its foundation in 1887. In 1889, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of movement.Paul Souriau (1889) L'esth√©tique du mouvement, F√©lix Alcan, ed. The book described two levels of movement aesthetics: the mechanical beauty (the adaptation of the movement to fulfil its goal) and the movement expression (the meaning of the movement for an observer). By doing so Souriau distinguished movement from perception of movement, two concepts which later became the subjects of studies of motor cognition and psychophysics. Throughout his career, but more particularly during the first decade of the 20th century, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of arts while being a professor at the University of Nancy.Paul Souriau (1901) L'imagination de l'artiste, Librairie Hachette et Cie, ed.Paul Souriau (1904) La beaut√© rationnelle, F√©lix Alcan, ed.Paul Souriau (1906) La r√™verie esth√©tique: essai sur la psychologie du po√®te, F√©lix Alcan, ed.Paul Souriau (1909) La suggestion dans l'art, F√©lix Alcan, ed.

They would have one son, and divorce in 1929.The Women of Warner Brothers: The Lives and Careers of 15 Leading Ladies with Filmographies for Each (Performing Arts), pp. 95--96. In 1933, Barnekow would meet his old flying comrade Ernst Udet in New York. They unenthusiastically discussed joining the Nazi Party. Both expressed distaste for Adolf Hitler.Kay Francis: A Passionate Life and Career, p. 112. Barnekow worked in the New York office of General Motors for a while. He also claimed to be making diesel aircraft engines. Then, while negotiating with Trans World Airlines in Los Angeles, Barnekow again found romance.Kay Francis: A Passionate Life and Career, p. 105. Barnekow met actress Kay Francis in Summer 1937. She believed him a handsome sophisticated wealthy man; he claimed he was the heir to a mining fortune. She overlooked his heavy drinking and misogynistic attitudes. Because he sometimes departed on unexpected secretive trips, he was suspected of being a German spy. At one point, he initiated an unsuccessful slander suit in which he claimed Francis' hostess Countess Dorothy Di Frasso had called him such. When discussing the suit, he told newsmen he was an American citizen.Kay Francis: A Passionate Life and Career, pp. 105, 112. Nevertheless, he and Francis were romantically involved. While posing as a wealthy businessman, he borrowed $1,300 from Francis; she also paid off about $2,000 of his indebtedness. He made a business trip to Germany in November and December 1938. Upon his return to the U.S., Barnekow settled in San Francisco in May 1939. To shield him from being interned as an enemy alien when war broke out, Francis proposed marriage and retirement to Hawaii. It was over her protest that Barnekow returned to Germany in September 1939.Kay Francis: A Passionate Life and Career, pp. 108, 110, 112. World War II service Barnekow had served with, and become close friends with, Ernst Udet and Kurt-Bertram von D√∂ring during World War I. Barnekow applied to his old friends Udet and D√∂ring for employment. D√∂ring, who had been Barnekow's commanding officer in Jasta 4, had risen to Lieutenant General by the time World War II started; he added Barnekow to his staff. Assigned to intelligence gathering, he suffered a heart attack. Udet committed suicide on 17 November 1941; however, the Nazis lied and said he had died an accidental death. Barnekow refused to work for Udet's successor, Erhard Milch. Barnekow was disheartened by Udet's death and America's entry into the new World War. Although Barnekow's date of death is given as 8 December 1941, sources state he actually shot himself during a \\"hunting trip\\" some days later.Kay Francis: A Passionate Life and Career, p. 116.

The species is adapted to a marine environment and is a wood-rotting fungus, producing small, gasteroid basidiocarps (fruit bodies) on driftwood, submerged timber, mangrove wood, and similar substrates. The spores have long, hair-like projections and are widely dispersed in sea water, giving Nia vibrissa a cosmopolitan distribution. Taxonomy Nia vibrissa was originally described in 1959 from submerged wood off the coast of Florida. The Latin epithet \\"vibrissa\\" (meaning \\"bristly\\") refers to the hair-like appendages on the spores. It was initially thought to be a deuteromycete (an asexual or mould-like fungus), but was subsequently found to be the sexual state of a basidiomycete, one of the few such known from the marine environment. Since its fruit bodies are enclosed and its spores are passively released, Nia vibrissa was considered to be a gasteromycete and was placed in its own family within the Melanogastrales, a now obsolete order of terrestrial false truffles. DNA sequencing has since shown that the species is actually related to species of cyphelloid fungi and agarics within the Agaricales. Description Fruit bodies are more or less spherical, yellow-orange to orange-brown, 1‚Äì4 mm across. The remarkable spores are oval, 10-15 by 6.5-8.5 Œºm with 4-5 bristle-like appendages up to 40 Œºm long. Habitat and distribution The species is widely distributed in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. Nia vibrissa has been shown to be a wood-rotting species and was first obtained by leaving wooden \\"baits\\" in the sea, retrieving them after a period of time, and then examining them in the laboratory. Other records of the fungus have come from a similar methodology, but it has also been found widely on dead mangrove wood and on natural driftwood. Fruit bodies of the fungus were found on wood salvaged from the wreck of King Henry VIII's 16th-century warship, the Mary Rose.

However, just recently it has been revealed from microsatellite DNA analysis (a.k.a. Simple Sequence Repeats or SSRs), that the American wild grapevine parent of Black Spanish (a.k.a. Jacquez) is Vitis berlandieri and not Vitis aestivalis.Genetic diversity and parentage analysis of grape rootstocks. Riaz, S. et al., J Theor. Appl. Genet. 132(6):1847-1860 (2019). This hybridization is not known to have been purposeful, and may have occurred naturally, as was the case with many of the early American grape cultivars. Riaz et al. (2019) have now published the genetic profile of the Jacquez grapevine as follows (percentages): V. vinifera: 69% V. berlandieri: 21% V. rupestris: 7% V. riparia: 3%. Additional microsatellite DNA analyses conducted on various 'Jacquez cultivars' by Dr Jerry Rodrigueshttp://www.news24.com/MyNews24/the- black-spanish-grape-variety-grown-in-texas-usa-is-likely-a-seedling-of-the- original-jacquez-20160803 shows that at least two of the European accessions (grapevine collections) which are presently curated in Europe were originally derived from the oldest known Jacquez cultivar (the Madeira Jacquez). The original American hybrid grape parent had found its way to the Madeira Islands sometime in the 18th century (where it was called Jaqu√© or Jacquet) and thence to France. Lenoir is another such seedling similar to Black Spanish which was grown and used in wine by Nicholas Herbemonthttps://books.google.com/books?id=JXqY3vV7_fUC of Columbia, South Carolina. Many other historical names appeared throughout the early history of these Jacquez seedlings such as Jack, Blue French, Ohio, and El Paso, among others. For example, Herbemont tells us that he received Lenoir seeds from a man named Lenoir who cultivated it near Stateburg, South Carolina, in the vicinity of the Santee River sometime in the 18th century. Lenoir had made its way to Texas, where it even took on the names El Paso and Black Spanish. From its wild South Carolina parent (likely, V. rupestris), Lenoir (and also Black Spanish) carries natural resistance to the Phylloxera pest, as well as to the deadly Pierce's Disease, which is a common threat to Vitis vinifera vineyards in warm winter areas of the United States. It now appears that Black Spanish inherited its known tolerance to the deadly Pierce's Disease (PD) from its Vitis berlandieri parentage. Lenoir was also one of the American vines which the grape breeder Thomas Volney Munsonhttps://books.google.com/books?id=apklAAAAMAAJ experimented with in the late 19th century in Denison, Texas. Prior to its use by Munson, Lenoir was grown and used in wine by Nicholas Herbemont, although to a lesser extent than the similar, lighter-skinned variety \\"Warren\\" (\\"Brown French\\") which become known as Herbemont because of his promotion of that variety. Lenoir was introduced to Europe in the mid-19th century, where French vintners were intrigued by its similarity to European Vitis vinifera winegrapes, and gave it the names Jacquez (or Jacquet). It became an important direct producing grape in Europe during the phylloxera crisis, and later was used to some extent as a rootstock to protect the classic vinifera grapes from phylloxera. Ulysses P. Hedrick's famous \\"Grapes of New York\\"https://archive.org/details/cu31924080184165 in 1908 provides the seminal discussion of Lenoir and many of the early North American grapes. Modern use Today, Lenoir is gaining favor among vineyards and wineries in the Texas Hill Country, the Rio Grande Valley, and in North Texas where Pierce's Disease is a constant worry with vinifera grapes. A more disease-resistant, black- skinned, red-wine hybrid of Lenoir crossed with Herbemont called \\"Favorite\\" was bred by John Niederauer of Brenham, Texas, and introduced circa 1938 (Brooks & Olmo 3rd, 1997Link text ). As growers in Texas realize the risk and expense associated with growing vinifera grapes in an hostile environment, Lenoir and Favorite are gaining greater acceptance. Lenoir has been used for years in Texas port-style wines and as a blending varietal for its earthy aroma and dark color. Only now are more wineries starting to use it in single- variety dry wines. Its taste has been described as completely different from European varieties, yet without the Concord-like notes of other old-line American hybrid grape varieties bred as table grapes from the wild Vitis labrusca grape. Also, the taste of Lenoir wine is said to improve when the bottle is left uncorked or strongly aerated by decanting, which suggests that reducing compounds are common in wines from the variety. Like the Virginia Vitis aestivalis hybrid Norton, Lenoir is gaining favor among wine enthusiasts who are looking for new tastes and locally sourced American products.

A segment on the show featured Maurice and his toast work. In a conversation with Cain, Maurice talked about what initially inspired him to take up toast as an artistic medium, his method of work, and how he has been stimulated by Pacific motifs. Buttercup Bakeries, a division of Goodman Fielders Australian Ltd, commissioned Maurice to make a large toast billboard. He used 2989 slices of Wonder white bread, toasted, to create an image of the international female impersonator Dame Edna Everage. The portrait measured 7.35m x 5.8m and covered an extremely large billboard in central Melbourne, Australia.

Keith Gemmell (15 February 1948 - 24 July 2016) was a British musician. He played saxophone, clarinet, and flute, and was best known for being a member of art rock band Audience from 1969 to 1972 and from 2004 to 2016. He was also a musical arranger and composer, published digital sheet music, wrote articles for the UK publication Music Tech Magazine, and was the author of several books including the best-seller Cubase Tips & Tricks. Early life and career Keith Gemmell was born in Hackney, London. He started playing the recorder at the age of 13 and was later attracted to the clarinet on hearing Acker Bilk's \\"Stranger on the Shore\\". He has cited his early influences as the British trad jazz bands of the day, Acker Bilk, Kenny Ball and Chris Barber being the best known names. Upon hearing such bands as Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, Sounds Incorporated and The Mar-Keys he decided to take up the saxophone and began playing in local bands. Aged 17, he turned fully professional, joining Bognor Regis based band The Noblemen and between August 1965 and May 1966, toured Europe playing in clubs, US bases and the Piper Club in Rome. On returning to the UK he joined Hackney band, The Lloyd Alexander Blues Band, who later metamorphosed into Audience. Performing and recording career Formed in 1969, Audience had an unusual line up of tenor sax doubling clarinet and flute, electric acoustic guitar, drums and bass. They had no lead guitarist as such and with the aid of echo loops and wah-wah pedal Gemmell's reeds replaced this traditional rock band role. After Audience, in 1972, Gemmell joined forces with Mick Underwood, Geoff Sharkey, Paul Simmons and Mick Hodgkinson to form Sammy. Their one and only album was produced by Ian Gillan (Deep Purple). Upon the breakup of Sammy, Gemmell joined the Roy Young Band. He now found himself playing alongside his teenage hero, Eddie Thornton (former trumpet player with Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames). He became friendly with Eddie and together they played many reggae sessions, along with the legendary Jamaican trombonist, Rico Rodriguez. After a call from their management, Gemmell left the Roy Young Band for a three-year stint with West Country band, Stackridge, a popular live act in the early to mid 1970s. Like Audience, Stackridge were a unique band with an unusual line up and quirky but catchy songs. He played on their albums, Extravaganza, Pinafore Days (US only) and 1976's Mr. Mick. When Stackridge collapsed he left the world of rock bands behind him, studying clarinet with Prof. Richard Addison (principal clarinetist with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) for a year. Now living in London, Gemmell joined several big bands, played sessions, played in function bands, on the QE2, taught for ILEA and enjoyed a successful freelance career. He also did a great deal of copying (music preparation) for film composer, John Altman, which kindled his interest in writing and arranging music. Following the session work, Gemmell joined the Pasadena Roof Orchestra taking the 2nd. alto sax and clarinet chair. They toured extensively and he remained with them for 14 years, (1983 - 1997). In that time, he wrote many arrangements for the orchestra. Later life and work Upon leaving the PRO, Gemmell built a second freelance career, this time as a writer of both words (music technology) and music (composing and arranging). His first book, Get Creative with Cubase, was about recording with Cubase, firstly from a musician's perspective, secondly, from an engineer's perspective. Other music technology books followed and in 2003 he began contributing articles to Music Tech magazine. In 2004 Audience reformed, and continued to tour and record until 2013.

Furthermore, the creation of conditions for reconstruction and development in Bosnia and Herzegovina and for international assistance to be provided was stressed. There was also an agreement between all parties concerning arms control measures and stability. The resolution then discussed IFOR. Member States were willing to contribute to a multinational force in order to implement the peace agreement for approximately one year, which the Security Council consented to. It was authorised to have control over the airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the right to attack to defend itself. On the transfer of authority from UNPROFOR to IFOR, the authority to take measures imposed in resolutions 770 (1992), 781 (1992), 816 (1993), 836 (1993), 844 (1993) and 958 (1994) would be terminated, along with the provisions of Resolution 824 (1993) regarding safe areas would also be ended. The participating countries in IFOR were asked to report every month. The Council created the post of High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and appointed Carl Bildt to the position to monitor the implementation of the peace agreement. The mandate of UNPROFOR would end as soon as the transfer of authority to IFOR had taken place, which occurred on 20 December 1995; the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's arrangements for the withdrawal of UNPROFOR were approved and he was also asked to report when that withdrawal was complete. Resolution 1013 concluded with the Security Council recognising the unique, extraordinary and complex nature of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which prompted an extraordinary response.

It would initially involve identifying up to five coastal valleys from counties Donegal to Cork, building dams on their seaward side and flooding them with sea water. These would provide a hydro-power back- up for the wind farms. The proposal has been likened to the construction of the Ardnacrusha hydroelectric power scheme, which was Ireland's first large post-independence infrastructure project and required investment equivalent to 25% of the national budget at the time but met the majority of the state's electricity needs for 50 years. The project was first proposed by Igor Shvets, a physics professor at Trinity College Dublin during a 2008 talk entitled The Energy Options for Ireland. Following the talk local engineers, scientists and businesspeople including Orbiscom co-founder Graham O'Donnell formed a foundation to further study the idea. Typically, wind farms only produce 25 to 35 per cent of their maximum possible electricity output when measured over a long period. The proposed hydro-generating stations would come into play when wind speeds were either too low or too high to be useful. Each of the reservoirs would be able store up to 100 gigawatt-hours of hydro energy. Under the Spirit of Ireland proposals, a very typical natural valley water reservoir would have a dammed lake area when full of 4 square Km ‚Äì e.g. average 2 km x 2 km. Based on studied shapes, depths and height from the sea etc., two such reservoirs would deliver some 200 GWh of electrical energy. A third reservoir would increase this to 300 GWh. This is a considerable energy store and in fact there are many valleys studied which would give considerably larger storage. 30 potential locations have been considered by engineers involved in the project. The long-term strategy is to develop higher capacity electrical interconnectors with continental Europe which would allow export of excess generating capacity whilst allowing for the import of electricity in the event of sustained no wind conditions. This scenario would be expected to be very infrequent and during such times the reservoirs would be filled using imported electricity at off peak times which would command much lower prices. Locations for the pumped storage reservoirs have not yet been decided but are expected to be located in areas that are otherwise economically deprived which would help to fulfil the Irish goal of balanced regional development. In 2013, Statoil was approached as part of a ‚Ç¨1.5bn first round funding drive for the project, but declined to participate. The scheme has failed to find further investors and several of the engineers involved have halted design work on the project until investment can be found. Additional electrical interconnector projects like the Celtic Interconnector between Ireland and France are progressing with Irish government funding and European Investment Bank support, these high capacity interconnectors with the rest of the European supergrid may make the project more viable in the future.

Geography Pindan country is geographically restricted to Dampierland, including the Dampier Peninsula and its hinterland, the area around Broome and Roebuck Bay, and a coastal strip extending south-westwards from Roebuck Bay adjacent to Eighty Mile Beach. It is semiarid with a tropical monsoonal climate of hot, wet summers and mild, dry winters. The flat, or gently undulating, land lacks prominent landmarks and is easy to get lost in. The soils are usually red and sandy with a high clay content, low in nutrients, and susceptible both to drought and to waterlogging when wet.Broome: Soils.Soils of the Kimberley. Flora and fauna Botanically the pindan forms a transitional zone between the wetter monsoon forests of the north Kimberley and the Great Sandy Desert to the south-east, exhibiting a mix of monsoonal and arid species. Structurally it is a low and open woodland of scattered trees, dominated by wattles, with eucalypts and tall shrubs. The understorey contains grasses and herbs. During the long dry season from April to November the annual plants and grasses die off, the country looks parched, and regular wildfires leave stretches of bare and blackened soil, studded with dead shrubs. During the short wet season from December to March there is profuse flowering of the diverse pindan flora, with a wide variety of insects and other animals taking advantage of the seasonal abundance. On higher ground, pindan adopts a more open savanna structure while, on low-lying ground subject to waterlogging during the wet season, paperbarks begin to displace the other trees. Canopy height ranges from 3 m to 8 m; the trees are short and deep- rooted, often with the trunks bent or twisted. In his 1926 book ‚ÄúIn Savage Australia‚Äù Norwegian explorer Knut Dahl described the pindan as a ‚Äúcrippled forest‚Äù in response to the apparent uniformity and stunted appearance of the vegetation. Typical species of trees and tall shrubs in pindan vegetation are the wattles Acacia eriopoda, A. tumida, A. monticola, A. platycarpa, A. colei, and A. adoxa, and the eucalypts Corymbia greeniana, C. flavescens and C. zygophylla. Other plants include Grevillea wickhamii and G. refracta, Gyrocarpus americanus, Terminalia petiolaris, Lysiphyllum cunninghamii, Ventilago viminalis, Premna acuminata, Hakea microcarpa, Persoonia falcata, Atalaya hemiglauca, Gardenia pyriformis, Pavetta kimberleyana, Carissa lanceolata, Dodonaea hispidula, Ehretia saligna and Santalum lanceolatum.Kimberley tropical savanna.Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands. Many savanna animals, such as agile wallabies and red-winged parrots reach their southern limits in Western Australia in the strip of pindan that parallels the coast along Eighty Mile Beach.

This article deals exclusively with Aboriginal Canadians and Native Americans in the United States. Paleo- Indians=Paleo-Indian weapons technologies The Clovis spear point is found at nearly all locations in North America. It is defined by its relatively large size and fluted morphology that allows it to be hafted onto the end of a spear. It is of some debate if this was a handheld thrusting spear, or a throwing spear, or an atlatl. It could well have been used for all three, including knives, as the bifacial Clovis point is very well made and utilitarian. Typically the points are made from high quality silicates such as flint, or chert. Often these stone tools are found hundreds of miles from their source stone in caches of semi-complete blanks. It appears they would bury some good material they had brought with them when they traveled, and sometimes either forget where they buried it, or possibly found more high- quality materiel in the new location, and had no need to retrieve the caches. Hunting Tests have been done on the velocity of these large bifaces, and it has been clearly shown that they are capable of wounding and killing modern elephants. The occurrence of tool marks, and bifaces found at kill sites leaves no doubt that Clovis people did in fact kill and hunt mastodons, mammoths, camel, horses, and bison. But could this hunting have caused the mass extinction that came at the end of the Pleistocene, or was it the climate change that did it? A third theory is also emerging, that the colonists and possibly domesticated dogs brought disease with them that caused this extinction. But the few species that were hunted by humans that became extinct doesn‚Äôt account for the loss of so many species. The loss of some cornerstone species typically can result in an implosion of population and diversity similar to what we see during the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene. This was probably caused by some loss of major species of vegetation. \\"Clovis First\\" There is a largely accepted idea called Clovis First. This theory does not mean that Clovis showed up and had the fluted biface technology, but assumes that over about 1,000 years the original settlers developed the technology, and Clovis was the first successful material culture in North America that became widespread. As Waguespack states \\"Based on optimal foraging models, it is argued that selective predation on high ranked resources, specifically megafauna, is predicted in colonization settings where large game is abundant and human population densities are low.\\" Most people that subscribe to this school of thought tend to believe in the specialized large game hunter societies. This is disputed by some as it has low ethnographic evidence, but the environment was quite different at the time, and with the right technologies and techniques this highly mobile hunter that depended on large game could be reasonable. Distribution The distribution of projectile points, and their variation in morphology tend to move from a north to south gradient, following the model that humans came in from the north and traveled south. Currently what we would like to find in the archaeological record, and what we actually find are disjointed. Even with accurate dates, and faunal floral assemblages, the specific way that these elements interacted is elusive, and remains in the theoretical environment. However these ideas, and the studies that result from them are what has driven information in this field for the past half century. A third and less subscribed to theory is called the Solutrean hypothesis. Bruce Bradley and Dennis Stanford, have recently resurrected an idea from the 1880s, Charles Conrad Abbott 1881, that claimed that the early colonists came from European roots. Although the Solutrean bifaces look similar to the Clovis technology, lacking only the flute, they are separated in time by about 5,000 years. Solutrian industry lasted from 20,500 BCE, to 17,000 BCE, while Clovis is popularly held to be from 11,500 BCE. Even in the face of modern dating techniques, Bradley and Stanford have continued to lecture, and published papers pursuing this model. The theory is based on atlatl hunting strategies utilized in a maritime arctic type environment. Stanford and Bradley theorize that people hunting seals would be moving across the ice sheets in groups so they could cover the most breathing holes as prescribed by this technique. In his studies they found that the seals today from northern Europe and north eastern Canada all migrate to Greenland. The theory is that people using something very much like an atlatl to hunt seals and other large aquatic mammals could have followed the wrong group of seals back to North America, and then used this spear based bifacial technology to adapt to the new environment. This would mean that these Paleo-Indians probably had boat technology, and used this spear hunting technology from the ocean, and adapted it to large terrestrial game. The seemingly enormous time gap between Solutrian and Clovis is overcome by the rising sea levels, and peoples dependence on aquatic resources. This theory makes sense because without a good knowledge of the floral assemblages it would be difficult, if not risky to depend on plant resources for survival. Meat from hunting is reliably nontoxic. As reported by Dennis Stanford in recent lectures (2009), there have been mammoth bones dredged off the shores of Delaware in the Atlantic Ocean, and one of the bones actually has a projectile point in it that is possibly pre-Clovis, but morphologically it is lacking the flute, and nearly identical to the Solutrean biface. This model is contradicting to the genetic mapping based on mitochondrial DNA though, and has many people that disagree. The similarities of the bifacial technology can be explained by independent invention. The only empirically based evidence is that Clovis people hunted large game. They also killed other small game, but it is always found alongside large game at kill sites. The Clovis point can be found in every corner of the continental United States. This means that at some point either a highly mobile group of hunter-gatherers persisted across the continent, or that a technology was spread across the continent because it was so successful. These points are large enough to kill, and are found at multiple kill sites with megafauna that is now extinct. Studies have shown that even light hunting on large animals can cause extinction. But most data supports a climate change that caused the extinctions. Archaic-Indian Period=Production rate of weapons Many improvements in technology came about through the Archaic Indians' increase in social connection. This had many advantages in technology, economics and society. The more constant interaction between groups of Archaic Indians gave opportunity to trade many things with each other. Tools, weapons, strategies, techniques and ideas were all exchanged more frequently and with a wider range of people than the Paleo- Indians. Obviously, this universally improved the living condition of everyone involved and sped the advancement throughout the Early, Middle and Late Archaic age. This speed in technological advancement increased steadily beginning with a slow progression in the Early Archaic age, and ending much more quickly with the immense change from solitary hunting in the Late Archaic age. Projectile technology greatly drew hunters of almost all game together to exchange techniques and technology. This increased interaction not only provided opportunity to learn or teach practices, but to also band together and hunt as a team. This, along with technology and environmental opportunity, helped define the trend of the Archaic Indian's integration, practices and social interaction as opposed to solitary hunting. Use of natural resources One of the distinctions the Archaic Indians had from their predecessors were the characteristics of more complex weaponry. Expendable, smaller projectiles were favored over the larger melee weapons. There were many fuels for change outside of the obvious advantages over this type of weapon in use though; the environment being one, if not the only factor. The newer availability of resources in the post-glacial age not only changed the abundance of weapons, but also the type. Being less concerned with the availability of local weapon materials, the Archaic Indians favored cheap, fast and easy weapons. This meant, for most Archaic Indians, projectiles. Projectile weapons Projectile weapons have the great disadvantages of limiting their use and breaking often. But, as stated earlier, the abundance of local materials meant that a brand new dart or arrow could be made quickly and cheaply. This also produced an interesting trend in technology. The Clovis tipped spears of the Paleo-Indians required a remarkable amount of skill and familiarity with the material. Each spear head had a great deal more care and skill taken in its creation. The larger size and persistence to the user meant that the user also cared a great deal more about its quality. Many of the Clovis tips surviving today have remarkable characteristics that only a truly experienced individual could create. Many of the marks on the Clovis tips are done with a single blow. Being that these are from larger rocks and less expendable, it is safe to assume there was a relatively low failure rate concerning the probability of error. One would have to assume that a great deal of familiarity was present in the craftsmen about the physical characteristics of the local rocks. The smaller, flying weapons of the Archaic age meant less time and care was taken into the tips, and with this habit, there became less familiarity with the rocks. Also, the habitual migration and interaction with others meant trade happened more often. The complexity, and quality of the Clovis tips was relatively quickly replaced by the cheaper, inferior tips of the Archaic age. Although this style was obviously more efficient, it is interesting to see the devolution of material craftsmanship brought about from the change in climate and lessening concern for scarcity. Early Archaic The Early Archaic age \\"... widely is viewed as a time of human adaptation to Holocene, post glacial climatic conditions\\". Coming directly out of a colder, much more glacier dominated landscape, the strain on resources relaxed greatly. In the glacial northeast preceding the Early Archaic age, the inhabiting occupants' energy capture strategies were vastly different from those adapted from the warmer weather of the Archaic. Groups of inhabitants in this much colder and harsher climate adapted techniques and habits with the aim of conserving energy and maximizing utility. This meant that much smaller bands of people would remain together throughout the year, ensuring less of a strain on a particular area. The smaller demand that a small band of hunters in this cold climate imposed was much easier to cope with the scarcity of available resources. Less mouths to feed meant that kills could be made less often, and with more gain per member. In the newer, warmer climate of the Archaic age, groups could be larger without added strain on local resources. The increase in faunal growth in this warmer and wetter climate also gave new possibilities in the social interaction between separate groups and societies. Mobility became easier and safer, and was less of a necessity pushing outward for survival and more of a pull-factor, enticing the hungry and opportunistic Archaic Indians who, at this time, were much more social due to the lack of glacial scarcity. \\"In brief, Early Archaic settlement is thought to have been characterized by: (1) settlement systems emphasizing logistically based organizational strategies, incorporating variations in Binford and Binford's (1966) base camp/extraction-station dichotomy (e.g. Chapman 1985; Gardner 1977, 1983 Goodyear et al. 1979; House and Wogaman 1978; Morse 1971, 1977) or alternatively (2) frameworks emphasizing a high degree of residential mobility\\". Twentieth century hunting technologies=Material culture and hunting technologies of the Inuit To begin the understanding of more modern hunting technologies in modern civilizations, the origins of hunting techniques must be examined. Many of the Inuit tribes up in, and around Canada were, until the late 20th century, excellent examples of both modern and pre-modern hunting techniques. These indigenous peoples have lived off the Arctic coast and plains for thousands of years and have learned to adapt to their environment, but they also have modernized their methods as contemporary weapon technology has come into the global market. The use of the rifle has decreased the energy needed to hunt prey from further distances than previously allowed, with traditional methods. Depending on the type/size/caliber of the weapon typically determines what type of metal will be used. Also, the bigger the calibre of the gun, the easier it is to obtain bigger prey and increase the general diet. Before the use of the rifle, it would have taken more energy to hunt, stalk and kill a caribou, particularly while the herd was on the move. However, with the rifle, its increased accuracy and range, more meat is available to be distributed to the families in the tribe. Also, the skins from the animal can be turned into leather, rawhide, or use the furs to keep warm. However, rifles were not the only weapon used; there were other hunting technologies available, such as the winter harpoons and summer harpoons. Winter harpoons, such as the toggling harpoon, were made of wood, iron, and brass. The iron was used for the shaft while brass was typically used for hook. The handle of the harpoon was made of wood that is tightly attached to the iron shaft. These harpoons were fairly small and narrow for they were used primarily to stab seals from their breathing hole under the ice. Once the hunter has set up his hunting area, he would stand by the breathing hole until he knows there is a seal on the under- side.The Eskimo: Fight for Life (1970) Directed and photographed by Robert M. Young. Documentary film about the Netsilik Inuit produced by the Educational Development Center for CBS Television. The seal was then brought to the surface and transported back to the community where the women and children waited. There are many uses for seal such as food, blubber for fuel, hides for warmth, and bone to create more weapons. These thrusting spears were not the only type that was used, but there was also a summer version of the winter harpoon; the summer harpoon was composed of all natural materials such as wood and ivory from a walrus tusk. These harpoons were bigger and weighed much more for they were used to hunt larger animals such as bearded seals and walruses. Wood is once again used for the handle while the walrus tusk is used as the shaft because of its straightness. The brass hook was also replaced with ivory for it is heavier and sturdier. Inuit groups, modern globalization and development For hundreds and thousands of years, the many diverse Inuit communities in the Arctic and subarctic have survived on traditional forms of hunting. Until recently, with the expansion of the western ideas and ideologies, technology and cultural ideas have remained untouched, but new technologies have played a role in modern-day hunting techniques. As mentioned earlier, one of their hunting technologies is now the gun, which has dramatically improved hunting efficiencies. \\"Since when boating [guns] must be kept ready at hand in case a seal suddenly bobs up within range,\\". Before the introduction of this technology, hunters would instead have been armed with some sort of thrusting spear such as a harpoon in hopes of catching a meal. With the introduction of the gun, not only can there be more accuracy in killing the animal, but also quickness and readiness of response time. This group, being as primitive as they are (according to Western ideology), has come in the global economy, even if it is ever so slightly. With use of guns, they must have had purchased it from somewhere, for none of the Inuit groups makes guns. In exchange for money, the hunters will sell furs, seal meat, and skins; however, guns are not the only modernized technology that these groups have adapted too, but also snowmobiles which allow for easy transportation, along with faster distance traveling. The consumption of gasoline is also prevalent in society, and once again, gas is another commodity that they must purchase if they wish to continue modernized hunting practices. In 1971, when William B. Kemp was observing the Inuit on Baffin Island in Canada, he recorded that of gasoline was consumed. While snowmobiles may makeup the quickest transportation means for the Inuit, they still relied on dog sledding until the 1980s. Most of the food that was once fed to the sled dogs who pulled the sleighs was meat from seals, caribou, walruses, or whatever form of food was available at the time. But even dog food has been modernized, and 12.8 million kilo-calories were imported: one hundred and twenty-eight billion calories, which if converted to the human two thousand calorie diet, would be able to feed six hundred and forty thousand people. When put into perspective, with the temperature being as cold as it, more body heat has to be produced, and with the amount of running and the weight of sleds the dogs pull, that more energy consumption that is needed in order to maintain a state of homeostasis and good nutrition for each dog.

It was believed for a time in the 20th century that he might have been born in Antequera (province of M√°laga), because his family was from there and his older brother Marcos was born there, or alternatively that he could have been born in Orce (province of Granada), where his family lived for a time when Pedro was a childIn 1925, Gallego y Bur√≠n published the certificate of Rold√°n's marriage to Teresa de Jes√∫s Ortega y Villavicencio, who were married in the Church of Saint Nicholas (Iglesia de San Nicol√°s) in Granada 1 October 1642, receiving the sacrament the following 16 February. According to Gallego y Bur√≠n, Rold√°n was born in Antequera. In 1950, Heliodoro Sancho Corbacho published a marriage record initiated by descendants of Rold√°n, in which the artist himself asserts that he was born in Orce (his final place of residence), where he lived with his parents. At the age of fourteen, he moved to Granada where he apprenticed to Alonso de Mena. In 1642 he contracted marriage to Teresa de Jes√∫s Ortega y Villavicencio,Juan Jos√© Mart√≠n Gonz√°lez, La escultura barroca en Espa√±a, p. 169 who was probably the niece of his master Alonso de Mena. There, in 1644, they had their first daughter, named Mar√≠a. In 1646, Alonso de Mena died, leaving Bernardo de Mora as the head of the studio; Rold√°n left for Seville. at this time, Juan Mart√≠nez Monta√±√©s was at the end of his career, presenting an opeining for Rold√°n's work. In 1660 he began to teach classes in sculptural representation as a teacher at the Academy of Art founded by Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo. In his last years, he established a large studio where he collaborated with members of his family (his children and sons-in-law) and his students. The studio designed and constructed altarpieces, sculpted and polychromed, undertaking projects in places as far-flung as C√°diz, Jerez de la Frontera, C√≥rdoba and Ja√©n. He died in 1699, and was buried in the crypt of Saint Mark's Church (Iglesia de San Marcos) in Seville. Besides Murillo, he was also closely connected to Juan de Vald√©s Leal.

The community, Catawba, was once referred to as Catawba Ridge, but this name recently became unpopular. Only tribal elders from the Catawba Indian Reservation now refer to the community as Catawba Ridge. Geography Catawba is located in the Piedmont (Foothills) region of South Carolina. Within the town limits of Catawba, there are certain areas of the land that consists of red clay. Red clay is the result of poor farming practices, which eventually led to the erosion of topsoil in the area. Prior to the erosion of topsoil, the Piedmont Region was once known for great farming. History The Catawba Native Americans first populated the area along the Catawba River more than 6,000 years ago. Settlers began to colonize the Piedmont region in 1670. The Catawba Natives believed in brotherly love and peace, so they created a friendly environment and relationship with the settlers. Along with the settlers there came new beginnings, tools, and diseases. In 1759, there was a small pox epidemic that eventually brought the Native American tribe population to less than 1,000 people. Catawba Indian Reservation The Catawba Indian Reservation is a 600-acre piece of land purchased by the Catawba Peoples in 1850, located in the community of Catawba. This reservation is the only Indian reservation that is federally recognized in the state of South Carolina. As of 2011, there are 2,800 members of the reservation. The Reservation offers childcare, a housing program, clinics, transit services, a senior citizens program, and a Head Start program for all members of the Catawba Indian Nation. Anyone is welcome to visit the Catawba Indian Reservation, but before anyone enters the property, they must understand and abide by their rules.

In 1979, War considered changing its name to The Music Band, possibly regarding its old name as too aggressive for modern times. (They had formed in 1969 during the Vietnam War.) But by the time this album was released, they decided to keep the name War, and make \\"The Music Band\\" the title of a series of albums, of which this is the first. The album marked the group's first personnel changes since lead vocalist Eric Burdon's departure in 1971. B.B. Dickerson (bass) left during the sessions, but appears on some tracks, while others feature his replacement, Luther Rabb. Composer credits can be used to determine which bassist played on which tracks. Another new member was Alice Tweed Smith (credited as just Tweed Smith on this album), the group's first female vocalist, and also the first member not to be included in composition credits, which had always included the entire group previously. The cover art appears rather plain at first glance, but the printing method was somewhat elaborate. Instead of normal four-colour printing, it used cardboard painted solid red, with metallic silver print. (Black print also appears on the back.) Embossing was also used, especially on the back cover where ink-free embossing illustrates a tall marching bandleader's shako hat, the logo for the Music Band series. (The next album's innersleeve photo would show the band posing with a cardboard cut-out man wearing this hat, and the cartoon face that had appeared on the cover of Why Can't We Be Friends? in 1975.) The inner gatefold for this album has a full colour photo of the group (without either Dickerson or Rabb, but with new member Smith), and the album also came with a lyric and credits innersleeve. The track listing on the back cover shows songs in a different order from their actual appearance. An edited version of \\"Good, Good Feelin'\\" was released as a single (and thus the longer album version is subtitled \\"original un-cut disco mix\\"), backed with \\"Baby Face (She Said Do Do Do Do)\\" from the earlier Galaxy album (1977). \\"I'm the One Who Understands\\" was later re-recorded for the album, 13px (Peace Sign) (1994).

War had more personnel changes since the previous album in the series, earlier in 1979. Charles Miller (saxophone) left after recording one song, replaced by Pat Rizzo (ex Sly and the Family Stone) who is credited with playing \\"horns\\". The following year, Miller became the victim of an unsolved murder. Another new member was Ron Hammon on drums; the group now had three drummers, the others being Harold Brown and Papa Dee Allen (on congas). Alice Tweed Smith, who was credited as Tweed Smith on the previous album, is Alice Tweed Smyth on this one; she is included in the composer credits for the first time (with spelling of Smith), but only on one track. Songwriter credits can be used to determine who played on which tracks (producer Jerry Goldstein is often credited as well), although Smith may be singing background vocals on tracks for which she is not credited, Rizzo and Luther Rabb are not included in the credits for one song (and possibly doesn't play on it), and one track is a new version of an old song with its original songwriting credits. The song \\"I'll take care of you\\" is used in film Youngblood as an instrumental and isn't on the soundtrack. The cover was printed using elaborate methods as used on the previous album in the series: a background painted solid green (instead of using a four-colour printing press), with metallic gold print (plus black print on the back), and embossing. An innersleeve has colour photos of the group, two from the same photo shoot session, each with eight of nine group members: Papa Dee Allen is absent from one, and Alice Tweed Smith from the other.

It is a dark green paramagnetic solid that is soluble in organic solvents such as toluene. It reacts with water to give the blue-green diaquo complex Ni(acac)2(H2O)2. Structure and properties Anhydrous nickel(II) acetylacetonate exists as molecules of Ni3(acac)6. The three nickel atoms are approximately collinear and each pair of them is bridged by two Œº2 oxygen atoms. Each nickel atom has tetragonally distorted octahedral geometry, caused by the difference in the length of the Ni-O bonds between the bridging and non-bridging oxygens. Ni3(acac)6 molecules are almost centrosymmetric, despite the non-centrosymmetric point group of the cis-Ni(acac)2 \\"monomers,\\" which is uncommon. The trimeric structure allows all nickel centers to achieve an octahedral coordination. The trimer is only formed if intramolecular sharing of oxygen centers between pairs of nickel centers occurs. The anhydrous complex has interesting magnetic properties. Down to about 80 K it exhibits normal paramagnetism with an effective magnetic moment of 3.2 ŒºB, close to the spin-only moment expected of a d8 ion with two unpaired electrons. The effective moment rises to 4.1 ŒºB at 4.3 K, due to ferromagnetic exchange interactions involving all three nickel ions. When bound to bulkier analogues of acetylacetonate ligand, steric hindrance favors formation of the mononickel derivatives. This behavior is observed for the derivative of 3-methylacetylacetonate.1\\\\. A. D√∂hring, R. Goddard, P. W. Jolly, C. Kr√ºger, V. R.

As in the anhydrous form, the Ni(II) centres occupy octahedral coordination sites. The coordination sphere is provided by two bidentate acetylacetonate (acac) ligands and two aquo ligands. Ni(acac)2(H2O)2 exists as cis and trans isomers. The trans isomer is preferred over the cis isomer (which was only found when pyridine N-oxide was used as the solvent). In the trans isomer, the X group occupies the axial position, forming Ni-O bonds in ethanol solvents. These axial bonds are greater in length (2.1000√Ö) than the equatorial Ni-O bonds (2.0085 √Ö and 1.9961√Ö). Trans and cis isomers of [Ni(acac)2X2] where X is a coordinating molecule Synthesis Bis(2,4-pentanedionato)nickel(II) is prepared by treating nickel nitrate with acetylacetone in the presence of base.

Route description  Downtown Greeley The route begins at the junction with U.S. Route 85 Business (US 85 Bus.) east of downtown Greeley. Within the town, it is known as 8th Street. 8th Street itself beings at an intersection with 26th Avenue inside the town As it begins to exit metropolitan Greeley, the road passes over the Cache La Poudre River. From there, the highway heads east on 8th Street out of town. After that, it continues on for a while, past a junction with former SH 37 until it reaches Fern Avenue, where it abruptly turns into a county road, near the beginning of Greeley-Weld Airport and the Sand Creek.  History  The highway was constructed and opened in 1939. At that time, it extended from U.S. Highway 85 (then known as 11th Avenue in Greeley) east out of town and ended at State Highway 37 north of Kersey. At some point the location of U.S. Highway 85 was moved to 8th Avenue, so the highway then had its west end there, for a total length of 6.74 miles from U.S. Highway 85 to State Highway 37. The highway was paved by 1946. Even after the construction of the U.S. Highway 85 Bypass half a mile to the east, turning the former US 85 into US 85 Business, the highway continued to have its west end at U.S. Highway 85.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. Grasser joined the Bundesgrenzschutz (Federal Border Guards) in 1951, retiring in 1953. In the 1950s, Grasser was involved in organizing an illegal underground army set up by Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS veterans in the event of a Soviet invasion of West Germany. Grasser's role, as inspector general of the police and border police, was to provide this secret army with weapons from the police force in case of war. Grasser was connected to it through Albert Schnez, its leader, who had been Grasser's employer in the first post-war years.

It marked the end of a continuous string of albums by the group from 1970, and they would not record another album until a decade later. The band's lineup is not stated on the cover, but composer credits suggest they had been reduced from eight members (on the previous album) to five. The pop art cover references concerns about nuclear war in Los Angeles, the group's home. The Hollywood Sign appears in the upper right corner, and mushroom clouds are reflected in the woman's sunglasses. The back cover depicts office towers (identifiable as New York City buildings) being toppled by a nuclear explosion. Producer Jerry Goldstein also produced the album Nuclear Blues by Blood, Sweat and Tears a few years earlier, which had a cover depicting a post-nuclear urban street scene. One single from the album was issued: \\"Life (is So Strange)\\" backed with \\"W.W. III\\". Track listing All tracks composed by Jerry Goldstein, Papa Dee Allen, Lonnie Jordan, Howard E.

Its title is a graphic of the peace symbol. It is often referred to as Peace Sign, the title of the first track, though arguably it could also be called Peace, the antonym of the group's name. It was released as a CD and also as a double LP, the latter containing an extra track titled \\"Africa\\", and a shorter version of \\"Peace Sign\\". This was their first non- compilation album in over a decade, during which time the group had toured sporadically. Most living original members appeared on the album, B.B. Dickerson (bass) being the only exception; but Lee Oskar (harmonica) is not credited as a group member, and only makes a guest appearance on two songs. Another former member Pat Rizzo (saxophone) also makes a guest appearance on the same songs where Oskar appears. Some of the official members of this album's nine-person lineup made somewhat minimal contributions: Ron Hammon is only credited with providing \\"drum fills\\" on two songs, while Rae Valentine is mainly credited with \\"music programming\\". Only five group members contributed to more than half of the songs, and Lonnie Jordan (keyboards) is the only one who plays on every song (Valentine contributing music programming to all but one). The album carries a dedication to War's deceased members, Papa Dee Allen (congas) and Charles Miller (saxophone). This album's lineup toured to promote the album, then broke up in 1996 when most of the original members wished to gain independence from producer Jerry Goldstein, who owned the group's name, and created a new group called Lowrider Band. Goldstein then created a new version of War with Lonnie Jordan as the only remaining original member. A 12-inch single was released with four versions of \\"Peace Sign\\". Another track, \\"I'm the One (Who Understands)\\", is a re-recording of a song from The Music Band (1979). Jos√© Feliciano makes a guest appearance on \\"East L.A.\\".

It is located on the Western Line of Auckland's passenger rail network and consists of an island platform located in a trench near the intersection of Khyber Pass Road and Park Road. The station opened on 11 April 2010. Connectivity and layout The station serves as a direct interchange with a large number of bus routes, including the InnerLink and buses travelling along the Central Connector, and is located in close proximity to Auckland Hospital, Auckland Domain and the University of Auckland's Grafton and Newmarket campuses.Newmarket's Western Line - Kingdon St to Boston Rd (from the 'ProjectDart.org.nz' website of ONTRACK.

Both of the Park Road stairs connect directly to bus stops. There is also a lift on the western side of Park Road. The entrance on the southern side of Khyber Pass Road is adjacent to St Peter's College and students have direct access to the platform without having to cross any roads.Sean Millar, Railway Stations of Auckland's Western Line: Boston Road to Waitakere before the 2004 upgrade programme, 2nd edition, Sean Millar, Huia, 2007, p. 4; Mathew Dearnaley, \\"Enter the station here, here, here ... or here\\", New Zealand Herald, 9 April 2010, .

Future When the City Rail Link opens in late 2024, rail services at Grafton Station will change significantly. The Western Line will no longer serve the station, as it will be rerouted through the new tunnels between Mount Eden and Britomart. Instead, the Southern Line will be rerouted through Grafton on its way between Newmarket and the City Centre, and a new Crosstown Line will also serve the station as part of its route between Henderson and Otahuhu. History Grafton Station replaced Boston Road station, and is located approximately 300m north-east of the site of the former station. The station was re-sited at a cost of $3 million to make it closer to major destinations such as the hospital and to allow more direct interchange to bus routes than the previous site. The line through the station was electrified in 2014, and AM class EMUs replaced diesel powered trains on the Western Line in 2015.

Established on 15 September 1901, Eintracht eventually became part of the tradition of present-day club Nordring Berlin. In the first decade of the 1900s the club played in the M√§rkische Meisterschaft, one of two competing top flight Berlin leagues, between 1905‚Äì09. They earned only lower table results and were relegated after a 9th-place finish in 1909.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon- Sportverlag. . In 1911, they merged with Berliner Sportclub Borussia 02 to form Berliner SC Eintracht-Borussia 01. They were joined by SC Germania Wei√üensee the following year, and then by Berliner SC Fortuna in 1926. In 1933, they joined another former M√§rkische Meisterschaft club ‚Äì Berliner Fussball Club vom Jahre 1893 ‚Äì to create Berliner SC Eintracht-Borussia vom Jahre 1893. Throughout this period and through to the end of World War II the team played lower tier city football. Following the conflict, occupying Allied authorities disbanded organizations throughout the country, including sports and football clubs. Late in 1945, the club was reestablished as Sportgruppe Nordring. They briefly took on their pre-war name in 1948, before becoming Sportgemeinschaft Nordring in 1949. Nordring was part of lower-tier football in the separate football competition that emerged in Soviet-occupied East Germany and following the reunification of the country in 1990 took on the name SG Nordring 1949.

Like several other early bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, he is included in the traditional list of patriarchs of the Church of the East.  Sources  Brief accounts of Ma øna's episcopate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century),  øAmr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth- century). His life is also covered in the ninth-century Chronicle of Seert. In all these accounts he is anachronistically called 'catholicus', a term that was only applied to the primates of the Church of the East in the fifth century. The account of Ma øna's life given by Bar Hebraeus is worthless, as Bar Hebraeus confused him with the late-fifth-century metropolitan Ma øna of Fars, an associate of Bar Sawma of Nisibis and a fierce proponent of Nestorianism. Modern assessments of his reign can be found in Wigram's Introduction to the History of the Assyrian Church and David Wilmshurst's The Martyred Church.Wigram, Assyrian Church, 113‚Äì18; Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 21‚Äì22  Ma øna's episcopate  The following account of Ma øna's episcopate is given in the Chronicle of Seert: > The Christians needed to elect a successor to Yahballaha. Ma øna, > metropolitan of Fars, knew Persian and Syriac. He had studied at Edessa and > had translated several books from Syrian into Persian. Yazdgird knew him, as > he had been introduced to him with Yahballaha. The Christians asked > Mirshabur, the head of the militia, to persuade Yazdgird to appoint Ma øna, > and they offered him a sum of money to achieve this aim. Mirshabur helped > them. He asked for an audience with the king and told him, 'Ma øna is a > Persian, and capable of serving you. Let him be elected catholicus.' The > Christians, happy with this result, hoped to see the restoration of the > churches and the end of the persecution. But their hope, as the prophet > Isaiah says, was soon dashed. One day, when Ma øna presented himself before > Yazdgird, accompanied by several fathers, the king fixed them with glaring > eyes. They realised that he was still seeking a pretext for persecuting > them, which he found in the conduct of the priest Hosea which we described > earlier. Then the king said, 'Caesar is the absolute ruler of his kingdom, > and can do there whatever he pleases. I am also the master of my realm, and > will do here as I choose.‚Äô The king repeated these words twice. A priest of > Seleucia named Narsai then replied on behalf of the catholicus, and said to > the king, 'Sire, Caesar may insist that taxes and dues should be paid within > his realm, and he can also kill his enemies, but he has no power to force > his subjects to abandon their religion. There are a large number of Jews, > pagans and heretics in his empire, but he does not force them to change > their beliefs.' The king was angered by these words, and his counsellors > exclaimed that Narsa√Ø deserved to be put to death for speaking to the king > in such a tone. The catholicus then said, 'Narsa√Ø has merely answered the > king‚Äôs question, and has done nothing to deserve death.' But Yazdgird > ordered the priest to be beheaded if he did not deny Christianity, and also > ordered that the catholicus should be stripped of his robes of office and > exiled to Fars, and should no longer be called catholicus either in public > or in private. Hosea of Nisibis and Bata of Lashom tried to speak up for > him, but the king forbade them to speak and had them removed. The magi > worked diligently to try to reconvert the priest Narsa√Ø to their religion. > But he remained unshakeable in his faith, and was beheaded. The faithful > buried him in the great church of Seleucia. > Ma øna returned to Fars. Yazdgird, learning that he was administering his > diocese, could not tolerate this and ordered him to be thrown into prison. > He was imprisoned for a while, but certain chiefs delivered him. Then it was > forbidden for him to be called catholicus for the rest of his life and even > after his death. He died in Fars.

He came to prominence first as a member of the Student Union for Peace Action (SUPA) during the 1960s and then as a civil rights activist, community organizer, educator, and lawyer. Family Rocky Jones was born to Elmer and Willena Jones in Truro, Nova Scotia as one of 10 children. His grandfather, Jeremiah Jones, was a hero during the Battle of Vimy Ridge in World War I. Jones was a fifth-generation African Canadian and could trace his Canadian roots back to the Black Refugees of the early 19th century.Burnley 'Rocky' Jones and James W. St.G. Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones: Revolutionary: An Autobiography (Roseway Publishing / Fernwood Books: Halifax and Winnipeg, 2016), pp. 7, 18. He grew up in a close-knit working- class neighborhood with white and black families. He did not face overt racism until he was old enough to attend junior high school.Jones and Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones, pp. 19-30. After leaving school, he went into the Canadian army and then spent some time \\"on the road and in the streets\\" and held a number of jobs. In Toronto he came under the influence of local leaders in the black community, including Harry Gairey and Leonard Johnston. He was also influenced by Eugene Bonner, whom he recalled as \\"very political, very aware of Black issues and foreign issues. He was a real nationalist, a union man too.\\" He met Bonner through his daughter, Joan, who also encouraged Jones's political development and reading interests. Joan and Rocky married in 1961.Jones and Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones, pp. 31-54. They separated in the 1980s. Rocky married Sharon Jones in 1993. Civil Rights Movement In March 1965, Rocky and Joan and their daughter joined a demonstration organized by the Canadian group, Friends of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), outside the American Consulate in Toronto, Ontario. The protest was in support of the Selma to Montgomery, Alabama march for voting rights. Almost at once, the media began to refer to Jones as \\"Canada's Own Stokely Carmichael.\\"Jones and Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones, p. 58. He also joined the Student Union for Peace Action (SUPA), and together with Joan, moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia to engage in a community organizing effort known as the Nova Scotia Project. They formed Kwacha House, the first inner-city self-help program for youth in the culturally diverse, lower socio-economic area of the city's North End.Jones and Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones, pp. 64-88. In 1968, Jones was responsible for inviting Carmichael and members of the Black Panther Party to visit Halifax. This attracted police and media attention but also led shortly afterwards to the formation of a coalition of activist groups, including more conservative older organizations, as the Black United Front of Nova Scotia.Jones and Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones, pp. 115-134. Jones also helped establish the Afro-Canadian Liberation Movement and was sometimes referred to in the media at this time as \\"Rocky the Revolutionary.\\"Jones and Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones, pp. 134-140. As a student at Dalhousie University, in 1970 he helped establish the Transition Year Program (where he taught for 10 years). He organized the Black Historical and Educational Research Organization (HERO Project), a pioneering oral history project on Black culture.Jones and Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones, pp. 152-163. He also helped create the Dalhousie Law School Indigenous Blacks and Mi'kmaq Program.Jones and Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones, pp. 184-186. Prisoner rights A strong advocate of prisoner rights, Jones was involved in the establishment of the Black Inmates Association and the Native Brotherhood of Dorchester Penitentiary and Springhill Institution. Jones developed programs for women in the Kingston Prison for Women, Halifax County Correctional Centre and in the community. He developed a wilderness experience program for ex- inmates and oversaw two production companies also staffed by ex-inmates. Jones was the Executive Director of Real Opportunities for Prisoner Employment (ROPE), a self-help organization for ex-inmates. Politics Jones joined the New Democratic Party in Nova Scotia in 1965 and remained active as an organizer and supporter in the following decades. In 1980, he ran unsuccessfully in a Nova Scotia by-election for Halifax Needham. At that time, he was one of the few known Black Canadian politicians. In 1995, Jones was co- chair of the People's Summit, an alternative assembly that took place during the G7 meetings in Halifax.Jones and Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones, pp. 227-228. In 2009 he helped Lenore Zann win her successful campaign to be elected as NDP member of the legislative assembly for the Truro area.Jones and Walker, Burnley 'Rocky' Jones, p. 248. Legal career Jones received his law degree from Dalhousie University in 1992 and spent several years working with Dalhousie University Legal Aid before forming his own law firm, B.A. \\"Rocky\\" Jones & Associates. While at Dalhousie, he provided legal services and taught law students. Jones' firm concentrated on human rights cases, criminal, prisoner rights and labour law. Jones was particularly interested in human rights issues involving Black people and people of colour. He worked closely with the Aboriginal community on land claims, justice and educational issues and was a Canadian expert on environmental racism. In 1997 he successfully argued the groundbreaking case of R. v. R.D.S. before the Supreme Court of Canada. This case set a precedent for race related litigation and contextualized judging. Guelph University bestowed an Honorary Doctorate of Laws to Jones in 2004. Death Jones died of heart failure on July 29, 2013, at the age of 71. Legacy In August 2016, Fernwood Publishing released the autobiography Burnley ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù Jones Revolutionary. Written by James W. St. G. Walker and Rocky Jones, it includes an afterword by George Elliott Clarke. In September 2018, a petition was started by Angel, a Halifax resident, requesting Cornwallis Street in North End, Halifax be renamed to honour Rocky Jones. The petition was signed by over 1,700 people, and presented to Halifax City Council by the area's City Councillor.

CuriOdyssey is home to nearly 100 rescued animals, most native to California, that cannot survive in the wild. CuriOdyssey's custom-designed exhibits are a science playground where kids play with scientific phenomena, including physical forces, perceptions, and reflections, patterns in nature and backyard science. Located at 1651 Coyote Point Drive in San Mateo, California, it is part of the Coyote Point Recreation Area, which overlooks the San Francisco Bay. The museum was founded in 1954 as the San Mateo County Junior Museum, and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). CuriOdyssey connects kids to nature with daily public animal feedings and educational programs where visitors meet the museum's Animal Ambassadors. CuriOdyssey is a member of the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). CuriOdyssey also participates in the Museums for All program, offering free admission and reduced-cost membership to qualifying families.  History  CuriOdyssey was formerly Coyote Point Museum for Environmental Education, and Coyote Point Museum. Located at 1651 Coyote Point Drive in San Mateo, California, it is part of the Coyote Point Recreation Area, which overlooks the San Francisco Bay. The museum was founded in 1954 as the San Mateo County Junior Museum. The museum was founded in 1954 by the Junior League of San Francisco as the San Mateo County Junior Museum, and was housed in a Quonset hut on the point. It was renamed \\"Coyote Point Museum for Environmental Education\\" in 1974, and the main museum building opened in 1981. In 1991, the museum opened its wildlife exhibits to show live animals that represented the ecosystems of San Mateo County In July 2006, the museum made its $745,000 deficit public. In August, it announced the organization was considering two proposals to save the museum: one from \\"Campaign to Save Coyote Point Museum,\\" and the other from the \\"11th Hour Project,\\" which proposed to scrap the museum and build an education center for global warming. In 30 days, the Campaign to Save Coyote Point Museum raised $540,247 in pledges from 776 donors, with an additional pledge from the TomKat Foundation of $500,000 over four years. In September 2006, they officially took over management of the museum. Rachel Meyer, formerly executive director of the Palo Alto Junior Museum and Zoo and Chief Curator of Exhibits at the Exploratorium, was named the new executive director of CuriOdyssey (then Coyote Point Museum) on March 19, 2007. With Meyer's arrival, the organization re-oriented to focus on young children, offering them direct, life-charting experiences with science and nature. On January 15, 2011, Coyote Point Museum officially unveiled its new name, CuriOdyssey. CuriOdyssey installed two public art installations in 2013. The first, designed by Eric Maschwitz and mounted on the exterior of the building, consists of more than 200 pinwheels, illustrating the wind currents at Coyote Point. The second, created by Mark Brest van Kempen, consists of more than 100 weather vanes.  Exhibits  The museum delivers education programs, science exhibits, and wildlife viewing and interactions to give young visitors an introduction to the sciences and natural history of the San Francisco Bay Area. Through these experiences, children gain the tools they need to think critically and take on real-world challenges they face now and in the future. * Science Exhibits ‚Äì 50+ hands-on science exhibits designed specifically for young visitors invite children and families to explore and experiment with natural phenomena including gravity, light, perception, lift and more. * Wildlife Habitats and Animal Ambassadors ‚Äì 20 naturalistic habitats house nearly 100 non-releasable animals native to California, including two bobcats, a river otter, Virginia opossum, snakes, golden eagles, gray fox, turtles, owls, western toad, turkey vultures, raccoons and others. Visitors can wind through a tunnel that lets them see into dens and interior enclosures, and then walk back around the outside to see how the animals live in the wild. Weekend wildlife presentations introduce individuals to the 50 additional Animal Ambassadors that keepers present for young visitors to see and (sometimes) touch. These education animals include birds of prey, snakes, a blue-tongued skink and much else. * Aviary ‚Äì walk-through facility that houses over a dozen non-releasable, native California birds. * Gardens ‚Äì of primarily native plants including a hummingbird garden and butterfly habitat.  Event rentals  CuriOdyssey is available to rent for special events such as weddings, banquets, and conferences. The four-level Redwood Hall has views of the Bay, audio-visual capabilities and capacity for up to 300 guests. The outdoor gardens are also available for after-hours cocktail parties or intimate wedding ceremonies. Event guests can explore the exhibits, animal habitats or even feature an animal ambassador in their event. Education The museum offers a range of hands-on programs designed for school and group educators in the sciences, as well as programs for the general public that help visitors explore, discover, and interact with nature and natural phenomena. The CuriOdyssey Mobile Museum and Animal Ambassadors regularly visit public parks as well as schools and other sites by special arrangement.

He spent a year abroad in 1952‚Äì1953 at the University of Santo Tomas in the Philippines, researching East Asian systems of government.  Career  Between 1957 and 1960, Ferguson taught as an assistant professor of international affairs at Pitt, worked as an administrative assistant to the chancellor, served as assistant dean in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, and consulted for McKinsey and Company. Ferguson spent the 1960s as a civil servant in the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and Department of State. In 1961, Ferguson became the first Peace Corps director in Thailand. From 1962 to 1964 he served as associate Peace Corps director in Washington and special assistant to Sargent Shriver. Ferguson was the first director of Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) from 1964 to 1966. He served as United States Ambassador to Kenya from 1966 to 1969. He served a stormy eleven months as chancellor of Long Island University, from which position he resigned in 1970 after the university's trustees rejected his proposal to split LIU into four autonomous institutions. He then served as president of Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, from 1970 to 1973. Effective September 1, 1973, he became the ninth president of the University of Connecticut.  University of Connecticut  Ferguson had a difficult tenure as UConn president. He assumed the presidency just when the state government under Republican governor Thomas Meskill was demanding the university slash costs. The state's annual appropriation declined from $34.5 million in 1971‚Äì72 to $30.3 million in 1975‚Äì76, a cut of over 12 percent. Tuition increased from 1975 to 1978, rising from $2,800 per year for in-state students in 1975 to $3,400 in 1978. Faculty and staff unionized in the early 1970s amid declining compensation rates compared to other research universities. The University of Connecticut Professional Employees Association (UCPEA) for most staff and the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) for faculty were established at the university for the first time. Ferguson opposed ultimately unsuccessful efforts by Governor Ella Grasso to consolidate all of Connecticut's public institutions of higher education under a single board of regents, which would have limited UConn's autonomy. Ferguson grew the university's physical plant during his five years. As library materials and student enrollment had far outgrown capacity in the old Wilbur Cross Library, Ferguson lobbied strongly for a new library. In July 1975, UConn broke ground on a new 385,000-square-foot building that would become the Homer Babbidge Library, completed in 1978. Also under Ferguson, the UConn bookstore moved to a cooperative model in 1973 after the failed ownership of Follett. Ground was broken for a new School of Fine Arts building. The Psychology, Institute of Materials Science, and Physics buildings were completed. At the University of Connecticut Health Center, the John N. Dempsey Hospital opened its doors. Like President Homer D. Babbidge Jr. before him, Ferguson faced intensive student activism over social justice issues. When students protesting racism peacefully occupied the Wilbur Cross Library, Ferguson sent in state police to evict the protestors, four of whom reported injuries and one of whom spent days in the infirmary. The Connecticut Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP condemned Ferguson's heavy-handed response and demanded that charges against the protestors be dropped. Ferguson never attained Babbidge's popularity with students or faculty. During Ferguson's tenure, the university also faced a class-action lawsuit by female professors alleging gender discrimination. Ferguson resigned in April 1978 to pursue other opportunities.  Later career  Following his departure as UConn president in 1978, Ferguson served a five-year term as chief executive of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. In 1983, Ferguson, who had not applied for the job but came recommended by the directors, was named president of Lincoln Center. Disliking New York City and the primarily administrative duties of the position, he resigned after only nine months. He later served as president of the American University of Paris from 1992 to 1995. Starting in the 1990s, Ferguson authored several books, including Unconventional Wisdom: A Primer of Provocative Aphorisms (1999), Americana Against the Grain (1999), Tilting at Religion (2003), Sports in America (2004) and Traveling the Exotic (2005). Ferguson served as founder and president of Equity for Africa, an early provider of microloans to rural entrepreneurs. He also was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Pacific Council on International Policy, and other organizations.  Personal life  Ferguson married Patricia Lou Head of Falls Church, Virginia, in 1950. The couple had two sons, Bruce and Scott, and a daughter, Sherry.Glenn W.

Description (Original description) The shell is of medium size. The whorls in the protoconch are well rounded and smooth. The postnuclear whorls show a broad concave area immediately below the summit, across which the axial ribs do not extend. The rest are convex. The base of the shell is rather short. The columella is short and shows a feeble fasciole. The aperture is rather large, deeply channeled anteriorly and posteriorly, the posterior channel being immediately below the summit. The stromboid notch is conspicuously reflected. The columellar wall is reflected as a heavy callus. The parietal wall shows a heavy callus that forms a knob at the exterior angle. The sculpture consists of strong axial ribs that extend from the anterior limit of the concave area, where they are strongest over the base, growing feebler anteriorly. Fine incremental lines are also present on the ribs and in the intercostal spaces. The body of the whorls is marked by fine spiral lirations, while the columella has strong spiral cords.Bartsch, P.

General characteristics The shell is turriculated, with an elevated spire, longitudinal ribs, and usually revolving striae. The spiral sculpture of the shell is rather smooth or shows a wide spacing of incised lines. The body whorl is usually short. The columella has a posterior callus. The outer lip is thick, but not varicose, nor dentate within, flexuous, with a well-marked posterior anal sinus near (but not reaching) the suture, and an anterior constriction or sinuosity. The siphonal canal is short, curved and usually narrow. Some species show an interrupted pink banding.

Description (Original description) The shell is large. The whorls of the protoconch are well rounded and smooth. The whorls of the spire show strong, broad axial ribs that are retractively bent and reduced in the depressed groove below the summit and extend anteriorly to the fasciole on the base. The finer sculpture on the ribs and intercostal spaces consists of decidedly wavy incised spiral lines and fine incremental lines, which vary in strength. The combination of these two elements gives to the surface a peculiar effect, resembling the scales on some butterfly wings. This sculpture extends to the basal fasciole. The fasciole itself and the area immediately posterior to it, as well as the rest of the columella, are marked by spiral threads. The aperture is moderately long and broad and strongly channeled anteriorly. The basal sinus is deep and reflected at the edge with a strong parietal callus. The stromboid notch is shallow.Bartsch, P.

Universit√† di Bologna, Museo geologico Giovanni Capellini 1-89 Description The narrow, solid and turreted shell has a fusiform shape. The protoconch consists of 4 whorls, with a sinusigera apex. The shell is axially sculptured by numerous slender and continuous riblets. The aperture measures about a third of the length of the shell. The short siphonal canal is wide. The anal sinus is deep and broad, separated from the body whorl by a callosity. A brown band on the periphery is a usual feature.Hedley, Charles (1920), A revision of the Australian Turridae; Records of the Australian Museum, vol.

History Danhuber was first assigned to Kagohl 6 and later to SS 25. His next assignment, which was on 1 July 1917, was to fly a fighter for Jagdstaffel 26. He shot down an observation balloon near Vlamertinghe on 12 August 1917 to start his victory string. Five days later he shot down Canadian ace Harold Joslyn and the same day got a second win. On the 21 August, he won the third time and eventually became an ace on 27 September 1917. On 1 October 1917, he had another victory in which he killed Robert Slolely and eight days later he shot down William Rooper. He scored on each of the two next days, and again on 14 October 1917, to bring his count to ten. On the 18 October Danhuber took a bullet through his upper arm while being shot down, probably by Andre de Meulemeester, which removed Danhuber from action until 7 November on which date he returned to action in a different squadron, Jasta 79. Danhuber ended 1917 by taking command of the jasta in December. He crashed on 11 February 1918 and was severely wounded. He could resume his command on 9 October 1918 taking over the Jasta 79 b. Five days later, exactly one year since his last victory, he scored his final triumph by shutting down a new Sopwith Dolphin.

The episode premiered on the Fox network on May 18, 2010. It was directed by Joss Whedon and written by series creator Brad Falchuk. Neil Patrick Harris guest-stars as former glee club star Bryan Ryan. Working as a school board auditor, he threatens to cut the glee club out of the budget, bitter at never having attained his own show-business dreams. Rachel (Lea Michele) attempts to find her birth mother, and Artie (Kevin McHale) struggles with his desire to walk. The episode title is a reference to Aerosmith's song \\"Dream On\\", also performed during the episode. The episode features cover versions of seven songs, four of which were released as singles, available for digital download, and three of which are included on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 3 Showstoppers. \\"Dream On\\" was watched by 11.59 million American viewers and received generally positive reviews from critics. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune, Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle, Gerrick. D Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times and Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club all deemed it one of the best episodes of the season, while Aly Semigran of MTV, Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack and Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal praised the musical performances. Blair Baldwin of Zap2it in contrast felt that the songs were inconsistent, and while Harris' appearance was generally well received, Eric Goldman of IGN felt that his storyline was lacking in impact. Plot Bryan Ryan (Neil Patrick Harris), a former McKinley High glee club member, arrives as an auditor from the school board. He speaks to the glee club, asking everyone to write their biggest dream on a piece of paper. He then takes Artie's (Kevin McHale) paper and tosses it into the trash, making a point that their dreams will never come true. Having failed to realize his own dreams, he intends to cut the glee club. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) convinces him that it is not too late to pursue his dreams and sings \\"Piano Man\\" with him. They both audition for the role of Jean Valjean in the local production of Les Mis√©rables, singing \\"Dream On\\" as a duet. Bryan decides not to cut the glee club, and even presents them with new costumes and sheet music, but changes his mind when cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) announces that Will landed the lead role. Will gives up his role in Les Mis√©rables to Bryan in order to save the glee club. Rachel (Lea Michele) confides in Jesse (Jonathan Groff) of her lifelong dream to discover the identity of her mother. While they are searching through boxes of records from her basement, Jesse takes a cassette tape from his jacket and pretends that it came from the box. The tape is labeled as a message from mother to daughter. Rachel refuses to listen to the tape, stating that she is not ready. Jesse later meets with Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, who reveals that she is Rachel's biological mother, but a contractual agreement with Rachel's two fathers prevents her from meeting with her until she is 18. Jesse reveals that though he had \\"befriended\\" Rachel just to get more acting practice, he had actually started liking her. She implores Jesse to convince Rachel to listen to the tape. Back at Rachel's house, Jesse starts the tape playing as Rachel enters her bedroom, then leaves her to listen to it. On the tape, Shelby sings \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", leading to a duet with Rachel in a dream sequence, ending with Rachel back in her room in tears. Artie Abrams dancing with the song \\"The Safety Dance.\\" After Bryan's discouraging speech, Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) retrieves Artie's paper from the trash and learns that his biggest dream is to become a dancer. Tina would like to dance with Artie, but he falls off his crutches when he tries to stand up from his wheelchair. Tina comforts Artie by showing him some of the latest research in spinal cord injury treatments. While waiting for Tina to buy pretzels at the mall, Artie fantasizes about being able to stand up from his wheelchair and dances to \\"The Safety Dance\\" in a flash mob dream sequence. He later asks guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) for advice on how to cope with the possibility of walking again in light of the new research, but is disappointed when Emma tells him that such treatments may not become available for a long time. Tina continues to offer to dance with him but he declines, insisting that she choose another partner but agreeing to sing during the dance. Tina chooses Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.) as her dance partner as Artie leads the glee club into \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\". Production \\"Dream On\\" was filmed in March 2010. In October 2009, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported that 20th Century Fox, the studio behind Glee, had approached Joss Whedon about directing an episode during the show's first season. Series creator Ryan Murphy is a fan of Whedon's work, and praised the musical episode of his series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, commenting: \\"Joss directed one of the great musical episodes in the history of television on Buffy, so this is a great, if unexpected, fit. I'm thrilled he'll be loaning us his fantastic groundbreaking talent.\\" Whedon deemed Glee his favorite television show, but downplayed his influence over the episode. Asked by Ileane Rudolph of TV Guide whether the episode would feature songs from Buffy, or his 2008 musical Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, Whedon replied: \\"I would have to say a resonant 'no way.' The episode isn't about me. It's the next episode of Glee. Hopefully my hands will be invisible on the show.\\" Whedon felt that his job was to be anonymous: \\"to find the most compelling way to present a story without calling attention to himself.\\" He acknowledged his proclivity for killing off fans' favorite characters, jesting that he planned to murder Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba). Whedon feels the episode's title is pertinent to the storylines, explaining that the aim was to examine the desires at the core of the central characters, including Will's desire to perform, Rachel's desire to find her biological mother and Artie's desire to walk again. He stated: \\"I was really lucky because there's a real phonetic coherence of the episode that brought them all together on an emotional level. For me, it was just a question that they dovetailed and didn't feel random and you understood why these three stories were all in the same show.\\" Kristin Dos Santos of E! Online commented on Whedon's tendency to work repeatedly with the same actors, and hoped that Dr. Horrible star Neil Patrick Harris might appear in the episode. Four months later, in February 2010, Dos Santos reported that Harris had signed a contract to appear on Glee. Murphy created a role especially for the actor, who received clearance from CBS to appear on Fox for the episode. Ausiello reported that Harris would play Bryan Ryan, a former high school rival of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), now a member of the Lima school board, intent on revenge for never having fulfilled his own potential by cutting the school arts program. Morrison stated that Harris' character is two years older than Will, and \\"got all the girls and the good songs\\" during their high school days. Recurring characters who appear in \\"Dream On\\" are glee club members Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) and Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), astronomy teacher Brenda Castle (Molly Shannon, appearing alongside her Kath & Kim co-star, John Michael Higgins), and Vocal Adrenaline coach Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel). The episode features cover versions of seven songs. Will and Bryan duet on \\"Dream On\\" by Aerosmith, and \\"Piano Man\\" by Billy Joel. Bryan also sings \\"Daydream Believer\\" by The Monkees, and a Les Mis√©rables auditionee played by Wendy Worthington sings \\"Big Spender\\" from Sweet Charity. Artie performs \\"The Safety Dance\\" by Men Without Hats and \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\" by The Mamas & the Papas, and Shelby and Rachel sing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Mis√©rables. Each of the songs except \\"Piano Man\\", \\"Big Spender\\" and \\"Daydream Believer\\" were released as singles, available for digital download, and \\"Dream On\\", \\"The Safety Dance\\" and \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" are also included on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 3 ‚Äì Showstoppers. \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" charted at number 36 on the Irish Singles Chart. Reception=Ratings In its original broadcast, \\"Dream On\\" was watched by 11.59 million American viewers and attained a 4.8/12 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. In the United Kingdom, the episode was watched by 1.54 million viewers and was the most-watched show of the week on the non-terrestrial channels. In Canada, it was watched by 1.86 million viewers, making Glee the tenth most-viewed show of the week. In Australia, Glee drew its highest-ever overnight audience with 1.30 million viewers, and won its timeslot in all key demographics. Its consolidated ratings were adjusted up to 1.56 million, making \\"Dream On\\" the eleventh most-viewed program of the week. Critical response The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune deemed \\"Dream On\\" a \\"highly enjoyable\\", \\"emotionally satisfying\\" episode, and possibly her favorite since the pilot. Ryan praised Whedon's directing, writing that it is clear \\"Whedon really gets what this show is good at when it's working\\". Lee Ferguson of CBC also called \\"Dream On\\" one of his favorite episodes of the season, commenting that: \\"NPH easily outperformed some of the other recent celebs (including Molly Shannon and Olivia Newton-John) who've stopped by the show\\", and hoped that his character would return in the future. McHale's songs in \\"Dream On\\" attracted praise from critics. CNN's Lisa Respers France praised both the Artie and Rachel storylines, and wrote that: \\"Harris' Bryan Ryan character had it all: timing, great singing and a crazy chemistry with Jane Lynch's character, Sue Sylvester.\\" James Poniewozik of Time deemed the episode \\"exceptional in ways that went beyond guest appearances\\", noting: \\"it was not just good compared with recent episodes, but entertaining, arresting and moving in an unqualified sense.\\" Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle called \\"Dream On\\": \\"one of the best episodes in one of the greatest freshman seasons in recent history\\", while Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times similarly deemed the episode one of the best of \\"an already stellar freshman season\\", and Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode \\"A\\" and called it \\"one of the two or three best Glee episodes ever. Hell, it might be THE best.\\" Aly Semigran of MTV reviewed the episode's musical performances positively, calling \\"Piano Man\\" the series' \\"most realistic musical number\\" and writing that \\"nothing even came close to the amount of awesome\\" that was the \\"Dream On\\" duet. Semigran noted that McHale's songs \\"proved he was a force to be reckoned with\\", and called the \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" duet \\"goosebump-inducing\\", observing: \\"Pretty sure that's what musical theater lovers' dreams are made of.\\" Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called Michele and Menzel's number \\"one of the most touching duets in the show so far\\", stating: \\"the vulnerability they both convey is stunning in its simplicity and perfection.\\" Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack wrote that the \\"Piano Man\\" duet was so good he wished it had been released for download. He rated the songs performed \\"B+\\" through to \\"A\\" and called \\"Safety Dance\\" one of his favorite moments of the episode, deeming it a \\"joyous, huge performance‚Äîdefinitely one of the most elaborate numbers the show has done before.\\" Blair Baldwin of Zap2it wrote that while the \\"Dream On\\" performance began perfectly, Harris \\"killed the song\\" with an \\"ear-wrenching\\" lead-in to the chorus. Baldwin also highlighted synchronization problems with the \\"Safety Dance\\" choreography, and wrote that Shum's dancing to \\"Dream a Little Dream\\" was \\"terrible\\" and \\"sloppy\\". Baldwin did enjoy the \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" performance, and hoped for greater consistency in the future. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 7.7/10, writing that while he had expected the episode to be \\"freaking awesome\\", instead it was merely \\"okay\\". He felt that the musical numbers \\"failed to really resonate\\", and called Harris' character \\"amusing in theory\\" but ultimately \\"one-note\\" and lacking in impact, with a storyline that \\"fizzled out\\". In December 2012, TV Guide named the \\"Safety Dance\\" rendition one of Glee best performances. In August 2010, the 62nd Primetime Creative Emmys awarded Harris an Emmy (out of two total) in the 'Best Guest Actor in a Comedy Series' category for his \\"Dream On\\" appearance and performance.

It was built near the village of Deyvillers between 1883 and 1885, and was modernized beginning in 1907. It is an example of a S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system fortification. During World War II the fort surrendered to German forces and was then used by the Germans to fire on neighboring forts Longchamp and Dogneville. The fort is now occupied by an activity of the French Air Force associated with Base aerienne 133 Nancy-Ochey and is not accessible to the public. Located northeast of √âpinal, the Fort des Adelphes is part of a line of sixteen major fortifications around √âpinal designed to bar the advance of a German army into France.  Description  The fort is situated at an altitude of , overlooking the road to Saint-Di√© between the Fort de Razimont and the Deyvillers works. The fort is laid out as a walled pentagon, surrounded by a ditch. Construction extended from 1883 to 1885. The fort includes fortified barracks, storage facilities and magazines, and shelters for troops. The initial garrison comprised 235 men, and the construction cost of the original fort amounted to about 1.2 million francs. The principal armament consisted of five 155mm and three 120mm guns on the fort's ramparts. The Fort des Adelphes was almost immediately improved with a concrete covered barracks for 150 men in 1892-1894. Between 1900 and 1906 a number of spiral queues de cochon or pig-tail infantry shelters were constructed around the fort. From 1907 to 1914 the fort was extensively reinforced, including the replacement of the caponiers guarding the ditch with more effective counterscarps, while a second reinforced barracks was added, along with a casemate de Bourges covering the ground in the direction of the ouvrage de Deyvillers.Between 1907 and 1909, armored observation positions and a 75mm gun turret were added. A third observation cupola and a machine gun turret were added in 1909-1910. Finally, the fort was connected to the electrical grid in 1913. The fort's garrison was by this time 400 troops. Two 155mm gun turrets were planned for a battery located outside the walls of the fort, but work was stopped by the outbreak of war in 1914.  History  The fort fired its 75mm gun turret at a German airplane during the First World War, but failed to hit the airplane. The fort fired on German troops in June 1940 during the Battle of France, but the fort surrendered to the Germans on 20 June and was then used to fire on its neighbors. The fort was stripped of equipment and armament in 1943.  Status  The Fort des Adelphes was significantly altered in 1990 to support a French Air Force electronic warfare squadron 48/351. It continues in that role until 2014. From September 2018, it served as a training center for the 1st infantry regiment of √âpinal which inaugurated on September 2, 2020 a Commando Initiation Center.http://www.opex360.com/2020/10/02/le-1er- regiment-de-tirailleurs-inaugure-son-centre-dinitiation-commando-au-fort-des- adelphes/.

He was last in charge of Serie B club Livorno. Playing career A midfielder, Breda made his Serie A debut with Sampdoria and later played with several other teams ranging from the top flight to Serie C clubs, most notably spending two long stints at Salernitana, being also a key member of the team who played a Serie A season during his first period at the club. Coaching career Breda served as head youth coach for the Reggina Primavera from 2007 to 2010, Breda was promoted as head coach of Reggina on 8 February 2010 after the dismissal of Ivo Iaconi. Breda's first game as head coach of Reggina was on home turf against Mantova (3‚Äì1) on 13 February. He guided the team to safety after a troublesome start of season, but was not confirmed as head coach and left Reggina in June 2010. Later in July 2010 he was appointed as new boss of his former club Salernitana. He guided his club to third place in the regular season, then losing the promotion playoff finals to Verona in a 2‚Äì1 aggregate win for the Venetians. He then left Salernitana at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season in order to return at Reggina, replacing Gianluca Atzori at the helm of the Calabrians for the club's 2011‚Äì12 Serie B campaign. On 8 January 2012 he was stripped from his managerial duties allegedly due to poor results, but he was reinstantiated only on 15 April, three months later in place for Angelo Gregucci until the end of the season. In the summer 2012 he was appointed head coach of Vicenza for the team's Serie B campaign, only to be sacked later in January 2013 due to poor results. He returned into management on September 2013, succeeding to Gaetano Auteri at newly promoted Serie B outsiders Latina and guiding them to a surprise league run that led the club to end the season in third place, only to be defeated by Cesena in the Serie A promotion playoff finals. After missing on top flight promotion, Breda decided to leave Latina, only to return at the helm of the club later in October 2014 in place for Mario Beretta. However, his second stint at Latina turned out to be largely unsuccessful and ended with him being dismissed on 5 January 2015, leaving the club in 21st place. On 7 November 2018 he was named new head coach of last-placed Serie B club Livorno. On 9 December 2019, he was dismissed by Livorno following a string of poor results, including 7 losses in previous 10 games and 1 point in previous 4 games. On 3 February 2020, he was reappointed as head coach of Livorno. He was however sacked for a second time only one month later, on 8 March 2020.

Its name was changed to Buzzards Bay on August 1, 1879 by the Old Colony Railroad who had acquired the line in 1872 with a merger of the Cape Cod Railroad. The present station building was constructed by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1912. Prior to the opening of the Cape Cod Canal in 1916, Buzzards Bay was located on what was then the north bank of the Monument River at a junction of the main railroad line between Middleborough and Cape Cod and the branch to Woods Hole. The Woods Hole Branch crossed the river slightly west of what is now the Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge, while the Cape Cod main line continued along the north side of the river before crossing where the river narrowed at Bourne.Massachusetts State Atlas, 1891 The Monument River was converted into the Cape Cod Canal, which opened in 1916. The Cape Cod Main Line and junction were moved to the south side of the canal, which was later widened in the 1930s. Into the 1960s the New Haven Railroad operated daily passenger service to Boston and seasonal day and night Cape Codder service to New York City. Originally located near the tracks, the station building is now set back from the train line because of the removal of excess trackage. The station also houses year-round offices and a seasonal visitor's center for the Cape Cod Canal Region Chamber of Commerce. It was a stop for Amtrak's Cape Codder which ran from 1986 to 1996 (again, New York to the Cape), and for the Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad which ran from 1984 to 1988. In 1988, the state refurbished the station building and added an accessible platform in preparation for never-realized commuter rail service. CapeFLYER and proposed commuter service A CapeFLYER train at the 1999-built high level platform in 2013 Second high-level platform under construction in June 2014 Original plans for the reopening of the Middleborough/Lakeville Line in the 1990s called for service to Wareham or beyond; however, plans were scaled back and the line was only opened to Middleborough/Lakeville in 1997. In 2007, the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization released a report evaluating the possibility of commuter rail service to Buzzards Bay including several intermediate stops. However, other projects like the Greenbush Line received priority and the extension to Buzzards Bay was not constructed. In 2014, a new high-level platform was built closer to the bridge. This platform allows CapeFLYER trains (which, like other MBTA trains, place the first car at the mini-high platforms) to avoid blocking the Academy Drive crossing while stopped at the station. In November 2014, it was announced that an improved siding would be fully restored near the station, including a universal crossover before Cohasset Narrows. The relative success of the CapeFLYER has brought new attention to the possibility of extending the Middleborough/Lakeville Line. The possibility was seriously discussed before the end of its first summer season. In September 2013, the Wareham Chamber of Commerce announced that based on the success of the CapeFLYER, the Chamber supported commuter rail extension to Buzzards Bay. The Buzzards Bay town selectmen similarly supported the idea later that year, and a public forum was held in January 2014. Bourne‚Äôs Transportation Advisory Committee began studying the possibility in mid-2014, with the addition of work by MassDOT's Central Transportation Planning Staff (CTPS) in November 2014. A Local Impact Report released in April 2015 proposed an high-level platform and two parking alternatives: a 120-space modification of the existing lot, and a 400-to-600-space structure including a realignment of Academy Drive. The CTPS data estimated ridership at 875 daily riders if all Middleborough trains were extended to Buzzards Bay, or slightly fewer with a limited number of trains. Bourne voted to join the MBTA district in 2015 and began paying an assessment in mid 2016 (for FY 2017), although there was no guarantee that commuter rail service would be provided in the fiscally constrained environment. For FY 2017, Bourne paid $41,707 to the MBTA plus an existing $88,429 to the CCRTA for existing bus service. MassDOT began planning a possible commuter rail trial service in October 2015. In February 2016, state representatives and CCRTA administrator Thomas Cahir said that the state wished to begin trial service during FY 2017, possibly by the end of 2016. However, the proposal was rejected by the MBTA Fiscal Management and Control Board in April 2016. In 2019, town officials raised the possibility of leaving the MBTA because the agency had no plans to extend service to Bourne within the next two decades. Withdrawal was rejected by residents at a June 2020 town meeting.

The latest version is Version 9.0. IBM United States Software Announcement 216-264 The open standard interfaces supported by WAS are common across all platforms provided the version and release levels are aligned. However, the functional implementation below the open standard specification line differs between platforms. That allows the specific attributes of the platform to be exploited without jeopardizing the common programming interface at the specification level and above.  WAS z/OS Platform Exploitation  The WebSphere Application Server for z/OS V7 product has code to directly exploit the following attributes of the platform: * WLM‚Äîis used for transaction classification, workload routing, server expansion and relative resource allocation * SAF‚Äîproducts implemented behind the SAF interface (such as IBM's RACF) provide security definition and security enforcement for the product * Cross-memory communications‚Äîshared memory buffer exchanges is at the heart of the WebSphere Optimized Local Adapters * SMF‚ÄîWAS z/OS writes SMF 120 records, including the new 120 subtype 9 introduced in WAS z/OS V7 * RRS‚Äîused for global syncpoint coordination between WAS z/OS and other participants in two- phase commit global transactions * zAAP‚Äîspecialty processors are used for Java workload to enhance the financial profile of the product  Version 7.0 \\"z Differentiators\\" (\\"zDiff\\")  Version 7.0 of WebSphere Application Server for z/OS provides five functions that are informally known as the \\"zDiff\\" functions. They represent specific exploitation of the z/OS platform. Those functions are: * New SMF 120, Subtype 9 -- A new SMF record designed new with V7.0 that addressed many of the shortcomings of the earlier SMF records cut by WAS z/OS. It provides a unified data view of each request/response to the applications servers. * Optimized Local Adapters -- an externalization of a pre-existing cross-memory communication feature. This allows address spaces outside of the WAS z/OS application server the ability to participate in the same cross-memory exchange that exists within a WAS z/OS cell. The Optimized Local Adapters (\\"OLA\\" or \\"WOLA\\") are bi-directional, allowing the invocation of EJB assets from outside the application server, and the invocation of services in external facilities such as CICS, batch programs, or Unix Systems Services processes. * FRCA -- \\"Fast Response Caching Accelerator,\\" is a function of the Communication Server element of z/OS. It is a low-level caching mechanism of the TCP/IP stack. An API exists so higher-level functions may exploit the caching function. The IBM HTTP Server (Domino Go version) has for many years supported the use of the API. In Version 7 of WAS z/OS the application servers support the using of the API as well. The important distinction is that with WAS z/OS the FRCA caching is seen as an external caching provider to the WAS DynaCache facility. Application elements cached to DynaCache are then pushed to the lower caching mechanism of FRCA. All the update and invalidation characteristics of DynaCache are extended down to the lower FRCA cache as well. FRCA eliminates code path to process a request when the object requested is in FRCA cache. * Thread Hang Recovery -- A facility that attempts to interrupt Java threads in the servant region JVM when the request timer has expired. If interruption is not possible it provides a mechanism to delay the EC3 abend of the servant region, which is the way WAS z/OS refreshes a JVM. The new function provides several enhancements over prior versions of WAS z/OS: the ability to set a custom number of threads per servant JVM; the ability to set a threshold percent of threads that may be marked hung before processing an EC3 abend; and a new \\"excessive CPU\\" variable that will quiesce the WLM enclave of a thread that has exceeded a specified amount of CPU time. * DCS/XCF -- DCS stands for \\"Distributed Consistency Services\\" and is a feature common to WAS across all platforms. It is in essence a signaling mechanism used to keep key elements of the WAS cell aware of what functions and services are available and where they exist. XCF stands for Cross-Coupling Facility and is a function of the System z and z/OS Parallel Sysplex design. DCS/XCF is a function of WAS z/OS V7 that moves the DCS signaling off the default TCP/IP transport provider and to the XCF signaling facility.  Version 8.0 \\"z Differentiators\\"  WebSphere Application Server for z/OS V8 introduced the ability to configure application server behavior down to the request level, rather than server level. This function is built upon the existing WLM classification file used to assign WLM transaction classes to identified requests. V8 provided additional XML tags to assign server behavior to requests identified in the XML. The following XML tags apply to different behavior that may, with V8, apply to the identified individual requests: * dispatch_timeout -- provides a value, expressed in seconds, for the timeout that applies to the received request from the point the request is placed in the WLM queue to when the request completes. * queue_timeout_percent -- provides a timeout, expressed as a percent of the dispatch timeout, for how long a request may remain in the WLM queue before being timed out. * request_timeout -- provides a timeout, expressed in seconds, that applies to outbound IIOP requests to an EJB located on another server. * stalled_thread_dump_action -- provides the action WAS z/OS will take when a timeout has occurred and a thread is marked as stalled. Values include: svcdump, javacore, heapdump, traceback, javatdump and none. * cputimeused_limit -- provides the amount of CPU time, expressed in milliseconds, that a request thread may consume before having its WLM enclave quiesced. A quiesced enclave is considered below discretionary in terms of WLM priorities. * cputimeused_dump_action -- provides the action WAS z/OS will take when a CPU time used limit is exceeded. Values include: svcdump, javacore, heapdump, traceback, javatdump and none. * dpm_interval -- DPM stands for Dispatch Progress Monitor, a tool that processes a dump action every n seconds (the dpm_interval value). * dpm_dump_action -- provides the action WAS z/OS will take every dpm_interval. Values include: svcdump, javacore, heapdump, traceback, javatdump and none. * SMF_request_activity_enabled -- enables SMF recording for the identified request. * SMF_request_activity_timestamps -- enables SMF timestamp recording for the identified request. * SMF_request_activity_security -- enables SMF security detail recording for the identified request. * SMF_request_activity_CPU_detail -- SMF CPU detail for the identified request. * classification_only_trace -- when set, this will activate tracing at the detail level specified for the server, but will only execute tracing for the identified request. * message_tag -- provides a custom tag, up to 8 bytes in length, that is applied to all trace and log records for the identified request. * timeout_recovery -- provides two values to apply to an identified request that times out: servant, which means the normal EC3 abend processing occurs (subject to thread hang recovery procedures outlined above that became available in V7); and session, which closes the TCP and HTTP session and issues an error back to the client.  Version 8.5  WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5 was announced April 24, 2012.IBM United States Software Announcement 212-109 A component of V8.5 is the Liberty Profile runtime model, which is a composable web container server runtime with dynamic update capabilities. = Liberty Profile use of z/OS platform functions = Liberty Profile for z/OS has several extensions designed to take advantage of specific z/OS platform functions. These extensions are: * SAF -- z/OS Security Access Facility (SAF) may be used for user authentication as well as a keystore/truststore for digital certificates. * WLM -- z/OS Workload Manager (WLM) may be used to classify work into separate WLM enclaves. This provides the ability to separate requests within a Liberty Profile server into separate WLM reporting classes for the purposes of resource usage analysis and reporting. * JDBC Type 2 with RRS --- JDBC Type 2 on z/OS makes use of a cross-memory connector into IBM DB2. When JDBC Type 2 is used then IBM Resource Recovery Services (RRS) is used to serve as the global transaction synchpoint coordinator between participants in the transaction. * MODIFY -- The z/OS \`MODIFY\` command may be used to initiate and process SVC and transaction dumps for a named server  External links  * IBM InfoCenter: Main InfoCenter page for WAS z/OS References Category:Java enterprise platform Application Server Category:IBM mainframe operating systems ","title":"WebSphere Application Server for z/OS"},{"id":"26949079","text":"IBM WebSphere Optimized Local Adapters (OLA or WOLA) is a functional component of IBM's WebSphere Application Server for z/OS that provides an efficient cross-memory mechanism for calls both inbound to WAS z/OS and outbound from z/OS. Because it avoids the overhead of other communication mechanisms, it is capable of high volume exchange of messages. WOLA is an extension to the existing cross-memory exchange mechanism of WAS z/OS, with WOLA providing an external interface so z/OS address spaces outside the WAS z/OS server may participate in cross-memory exchanges. WOLA supports connectivity between a WAS z/OS server and one or more of the following: CICS, IMS, Batch, UNIX Systems Services and ALCS. WOLA was first made available in WAS z/OS Version 7, Fixpack 4 (7.0.0.4). Functional enhancements have appeared in subsequent fixpacks as documented in this article.  History  The WebSphere Optimized Local Adapters for WAS z/OS (WOLA or OLA for short) has its origins in a desire to provide an efficient inbound calling mechanism; that is, from outside the Java EE environment into it to exercise Java EE assets. This requirement was particularly pronounced on z/OS where traditional batch processing sought the use of a growing base of programming assets based on Java EE and EJB technology. Other inbound solutions existed, for example: *Messaging, such as Websphere MQ or other JMS providers. *RMI/IIOP *Web Services While each had its respective strengths; each also had its particular shortcomings: overhead and latency; difficulty in construction; or deficiencies in the security or transaction propagation model. This was the original design point for the Optimized Local Adapters. The architects of the solution extended the design to include bi-directional invocations: inbound to WAS z/OS from an external address space, and outbound from WAS to an external address space.  Technical Foundation  The architects of this solution chose to leverage an existing element of the WAS z/OS design called \\"local communications,\\" a cross-memory mechanism used by WebSphere Application Server for z/OS since the V4.x days that optimized IIOP traffic between application servers on the same LPAR. OLA is essentially an externalization of that existing cross-memory mechanism so that address spaces outside WAS z/OS may connect and exchange messages across a shared memory space. External address space programs access the OLA interface using a set of supplied APIs. Java programs running in WAS z/OS access the OLA interface through an implementation packaged as a standard JCA resource adapter.  Current Support  The currently supported external address spaces supported for WAS z/OS OLA are: * IBM CICS * Batch Jobs * UNIX System Services (USS) * Airline Control System (ALCS) * IMS (support started with maintenance 7.0.0.12) The programming languages supported in the external address spaces are: * C/C++ * COBOL * High Level Assembler * PL/I Java is the programming language used to access WAS z/OS OLA from inside the Java EE containers of WAS z/OS.  Function Update History  IBM WebSphere Optimized Adapters function support has been updated as new versions or fixpacks are released. The function was first made available in WAS z/OS Version 7 Release 0 Fixpack 4 level (7.0.0.4). Functional Updates, Part 1 Functional Updates, Part 3  7.0.0.4  WOLA was introduced with Fixpack 4 to the WAS z/OS Version 7 Release 0 product. Application of maintenance resulted in a new directory in the product file system that provided the WOLA modules, shared objects, JCA resource adapter and development class libraries. A shell script (olaInstall.sh) created the necessary UNIX symbolic links from the runtime environment to product install file system. The functional supported offered in the 7.0.0.4 release was: * Support for CICS, Batch, USS, and ALCS * One-phase commit for outbound WAS into CICS (2PC into CICS TS 4.1 provided with 7.0.0.12) * Two- phase commit for inbound CICS into WAS * Native APIs * JCA resource adapter  7.0.0.12  Fixpack 12 to WAS z/OS Version 7 Release 0 provided two updates to the WOLA support: * Support for WOLA and IMS * Two-phase commit transaction processing from WAS outbound to CICS TS 4.1  8.0.0.0  WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Version 8 Release 0 continued support for WebSphere Optimized Local Adapters. WOLA was shipped incorporated into the product, which meant running the olaInstall.sh was no longer required to create UNIX symbolic links to the product files. In addition the following function updates were provided: * Multi-segment large message support (greater than 32K in size) for work with IMS * Support for inbound transaction classification of WOLA calls separate from IIOP calls * Identification within the SMF 120.9 record for WOLA calls as WOLA rather than IIOP * Resource failure identification and alternative JNDI failover = Resource Failover and Failback = This function provides a means of detecting the loss of a data resource attached to a JCA connection factory and automatically failing over to a defined alternate JNDI. Detection of primary data resource recovery and failback is also an element of this functional design. The resource failover design is present in WebSphere Application Server Version 8 across all platforms for JDBC and JCA. WAS z/OS Version 8 provides support for WOLA resource failover as part of the general support for JCA resource failover. Invocation of the failover occurs when a configurable threshold number of getConnection() failures occur. After failover is invoked, all new getConnection() requests are routed to the alternate connection factory connection pool. Failback occurs when WAS z/OS determines the failed primary data resource has returned. New getConnection() requests are processed against the primary connection factory. A common usage pattern for this function is outbound to CICS where the target CICS region is a routing region. This failover function provides the ability to architect multiple routing regions so that the loss of any single routing region does not affect the overall availability of CICS overall. Several connection pool custom properties were added to support this resource failover and failback mechanism: * \`failureThreshold\` \\\\- the number of consecutive getConnection() failures that must occur before automatic failover is invoked * \`alternateResourceJNDIName\` \\\\- the JNDI name of the alternate connection factory to use if automatic failover is invoked * \`resourceAvailabilityTestRetryInterval\` \\\\- the interval in seconds WAS employs to test for return of primary resource Note: other connection pool custom properties exist for this function. Search on string \\"cdat_dsfailover\\" in the WAS z/OS InfoCenter for a complete listing.  8.0.0.1 / 8.5.0.0  Note: WAS z/OS 8.5.0.0 provides WOLA support functionally identical to 8.0.0.1 Fixpack 1 to WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Version 8 provided the following functional updates to WOLA: * 64-bit callable native APIs for C/C++ programs operating in 64-bit mode * SMF 120 subtype 10 records for WOLA outbound calls from WAS (SMF 120 subtype 9 captures inbound call information) * Work Distribution - the ability to round- robin outbound calls across multiple external registrations of the same name * Proxy support for remote access - this takes two forms: inbound and outbound = 64-bit Callable Native API Modules = Prior to 8.0.0.1 the native API modules were supplied in 31-bit callable format only. These modules had the four-character prefix BBOA* associated with each module name. With 8.0.0.1 both 31-bit and 64-bit callable API modules are provided. The 31-bit modules retain the four-character prefix BBOA* for each module name. The 64-bit modules carry the four-character prefix BBGA* for each module name. The number of APIs remains the same as before: 13 specific APIs. Usage is the same as before. InfoCenter Search: cdat_olaapis = SMF 120.10 for WOLA Outbound Calls = In WAS z/OS V7 the WOLA support for SMF was limited to inbound calls only. Inbound WOLA calls to target EJBs in the WAS z/OS container were identified as IIOP calls and captured by SMF as IIOP calls, indistinguishable from any other IIOP call. The normal WAS z/OS SMF 120 subtype 9 record (or 120.9 in shorthand notation) was used to capture the inbound call information. With WAS z/OS 8.0.0.0 the SMF 120.9 record and capture function was modified to identify inbound WOLA calls separate from inbound IIOP calls. With WAS z/OS 8.0.0.1 the SMF 120.10 record was created to capture information about outbound calls from WAS z/OS. The SMF 120.10 record has eight sections: * Platform neutral server information section * z/OS server information section * Outbound Request information section * WOLA Outbound Request type specific section * Outbound Request transaction context section * Outbound Request security context section * Outbound Request CICS context section * OTMA Outbound Request type specific section One record is created for each outbound request. InfoCenter Search: rtrb_SMFsubtype10 = Work Distribution = This functional update provides the ability to distribute outbound calls across multiple external address spaces registered into a given WAS z/OS server using the same registration name. A common usage pattern for this would multiple CICS regions with the same stateless target program service deployed. A new environment variable was created to indicate the type of work distribution desired. The following illustrates the usage of this function: File:OLA Work Distribution.jpg InfoCenter Search: cdat_olacustprop = Proxy Support: Inbound and Outbound = The cross-memory nature of WOLA communications implies the WAS z/OS server and the external address space must be on the same z/OS logical partition (LPAR). WAS z/OS 8.0.0.1 provides a proxy function to allow WOLA callers and WOLA targets to be located separately. This includes location on operating system instances other than z/OS. This function has two formats: proxy support for outbound calls, and proxy support for inbound calls.  Proxy Support for Outbound Calls  This provides a mechanism by which Java applications may use the supplied WOLA JCA resource adapter to access a target address space on remote z/OS. An example usage pattern would be development or test of a proposed an application. Access to the cross- memory WOLA connection on the target z/OS system is provided by a supplied WOLA proxy application installed in a WAS z/OS server enabled for WOLA. The following picture illustrates the topology: File:OLA Proxy Outbound Calls.jpg The network flow from the application to the WAS z/OS system is by way of IIOP. The WOLA connection factory is informed of this IIOP flow to the proxy by way of several new custom properties to the connection pool. The proxy application on WAS z/OS receives the call and forwards it over an actual cross-memory WOLA connection to the named target service. This topology has limitations compared to outbound WOLA calls on the same z/OS LPAR: global transactions requiring two-phase commit can not be propagated across the IIOP connection to the WOLA proxy, and the user identity on the WAS thread can not be asserted into the target service on z/OS.  Proxy Support for Inbound Calls  This provides a mechanism by which non-Java applications in an external address space may make inbound calls to a target WOLA-enabled EJB in a remote WAS instance, either on another z/OS LPAR or a distributed WAS platform. The same supplied WOLA proxy application installed in a local WAS z/OS instance is required to handle the initial cross-memory WOLA call and forward that to the named target EJB on the remote WAS instance. The following picture illustrates the topology: File:OLA Proxy Inbound Calls.jpg The target WOLA-enabled EJB is unaware the proxy is in use. The inbound flow arrives as an IIOP call just as it does if cross-memory WOLA on the same LPAR was used. The calling program must indicate the flow will use the proxy service. This is done with a parameter on BBOA1INV (or BBOA1SRQ) of 2 for the requesttype parameter. This tells the local proxy application to treat requested service, which is specified as the JNDI name of the target EJB, as a request to invoke the EJB using IIOP. This requires the local and remote WAS instances to have federated names spaces or operate as a single cell for the JNDI lookup to succeed.  8.0.0.3 and 8.0.0.4 / 8.5.0.1  In 8.0.0.3 (and 8.5.0.1) WOLA support included in IBM Integration Designer for BPEL Processes. In 8.0.0.4 (and 8.5.0.1) support updated to include RRS transaction context assertion from IMS dependent regions into WAS over WOLA: * Applications in IMS use set the \\"transaction supported\\" flag on register API * Target WAS environment has ola_rrs_context_propagate = 1 environment variable set and enabled * IMS Control Region needs to be running with RRS=Y  8.0.0.5 (and 8.5.0.2)  Fixpack 8.0.0.5 / 8.5.0.2 provided two functional enhancements: (1) RRS transaction context assertion from WAS into IMS over WOLA / OTMA, and (2) enhanced support for CICS channels and containers. For IMS transaction: * IMS Control Region needs to be running with RRS=Y * Target WAS environment has ola_rrs_context_propagate_otma = 1 environment variable set and enabled For enhanced support for CICS channels and containers, prior to 8.0.0.5 / 8.5.0.2 the CICS channels and containers support was limited to a single fixed-name channel for both request and response, and a single container of type BIT or CHAR. With 8.0.0.5 / 8.5.0.2: * Send and receive one or more containers from target CICS program * Channel name is set by you using setLinkTaskChanID() method * Channel type is set by you using setLinkTaskChanType() method * The names of the individual request containers are set by adding data to the MappedRecord, using the put() method. * The keys of the MappedRecord correspond to the CICS container names, and the corresponding value will be used to fill the container in CICS. * The response container names will be extracted from the channel after the CICS request is finished, and populated into a new MappedRecord, which is returned to the client.  Components  The Optimized Local Adapters may be categorized into the following components: * Interface Modules -- provide the programmatic access to the OLA interface and the OLA APIs * CICS Task Related User Exit, Link Task Server and control transaction -- provides a simplified mechanism for supporting outbound calls to program assets in CICS. * JCA Resource Adapter -- provides the interface between the Java environment and the external environment * Development Tooling Support -- provides the supporting classes for developing OLA-enabled applications * Samples -- a set of C/C++, COBOL and Java samples that illustrate the use of the programming model  Overview of CICS support  The Optimized Local Adapters are implemented in CICS as a Task Related User Exit (TRUE). This is what provides the essential connectivity from CICS cross memory to the WAS z/OS address space. In addition, a Link Server Task (BBO$) and a Link Invocation Task (BBO#) is supplied for calls from WAS to CICS. The BBO$/BBO# link server task shields programming specifics from CICS programs. The OLA call from WAS is handled by these supplied tasks, and the named CICS program is invoked with the standard EXEC CICS LINK call. The named CICS program remains unchanged and unaware the call came from WAS using OLA. The target program in CICS must be able to be invoked with a LINK call. Both COMMAREA and Channels/Containers is supported. Image:WOLA-Link-Server.jpg A BBOC transaction is also supplied to provide a set of control commands to do things such as manually start the TRUE (if not in PLTPI), stop the TRUE, start and stop the Link Server, as well as other control and management functions. The OLA programming interface module library data set must be concatenated to the CICS region's DFHRPL DD statement. The following picture summarizes the WOLA CICS support for transaction propagation and security assertion: Image:CICS-TX-Sec.jpg  Overview of IMS support  The Optimized Local Adapters are implemented as an external subsystem to IMS. Usage is supported for Message Processing Programs (MPP), Batch Message Processing programs (BMP), IMS Fast Path (IFP) and Batch DL/I applications. Calls from IMS into WAS use the External Subsystem Attach Facility (ESAF). This is the same interface as used by other subsystems such as DB2 or MQ. Calls from WAS into the IMS dependent region may be done using OTMA or directly (that is, program in IMS uses OLA APIs to \\"host a service\\" as described below). OTMA provides OLA transparency to the IMS applications at a cost of some overhead. Using the OLA APIs in the IMS application reduces the overhead which results in better performance and throughput. Image:WOLA-IMS-Overview.jpg The programming APIs for IMS are the same format and syntax as introduced originally. But they have been updated to be aware of IMS if running there and to use ESAF. Further, the ola.rar file that implements the JCA resource adapter for WAS must be the one shipped with Fixpack 7.0.0.12 or later to use with IMS. The method parameters have been updated for the IMS support and that update is made available to WAS by re-installing the ola.rar that comes with 7.0.0.12. The following picture summarizes the WOLA IMS support for transaction propagation and security assertion: Image:IMS-TX-Sec3.jpg  Programming Considerations = Inbound to WAS z/OS  The external address space accesses the OLA mechanism through the supplied interface modules and documented APIs. There are 13 APIs at the present time. They are categorized below. Java programs running in the WAS z/OS environment wishing to be the target of an invocation from outside must implement the OLA interface in a stateless session bean using the OLA class files supplied in the development tooling support.  Outbound from WAS z/OS  A Java program wishing to initiate an OLA call outbound may be implemented as either a servlet or EJB. The Java program codes to the supplied JCA resource adapter (ola.rar) using the class files supplied in the development tooling support. External address spaces that are the target of the outbound call must be in a state ready to accept the call. Two basic models exist: * If the external address space is CICS, then the user has the option to employ the supplied Link Server Task to act as the receiving agent on behalf of existing CICS program assets. The Link Server task (BBO$ by default) receives the call and issues an EXEC CICS LINK of the program named on interactionSpecImpl.setServiceName(). No changes to the existing CICS program are necessary provided it supports either COMMAREA or Channels/Containers. * If the external address is IMS, then the call may be made using the IMS OTMA interface (which implies no change to your IMS application), or directly using OLA (which implies using the OLA APIs in the IMS program to \\"host a service\\"). * If the external address space is something other than CICS or IMS, then the program needs to \\"host a service\\" using one of the supplied APIs. That puts the program in a state ready to receive a call from the Java program in WAS z/OS. When the call is received it may then process the request and supply a response back to the Java program in WAS z/OS  Synchronous and Asynchronous Operations  The APIs support both modes. Synchronous provides a simpler programming model because program control is not returned to the calling program until a response has been received. Asynchronous provides the architect with an opportunity to process other work without having to wait on a response coming back from a long running target process.  Modular Design  It is possible to design the OLA-specific programming artifacts to serve as \\"bridges\\" between the OLA interface and existing assets. That serves to minimize impact to existing programming assets and limits the degree of \\"platform lock in.\\" * Outbound to CICS‚Äîuse the provided Link Server implementation; no changes to your CICS programs at all. * Inbound to WAS‚Äîconstruct an EJB that takes the OLA call, then turns and calls the specified EJB. If the target EJB is in the same JVM then it can be highly efficient. If the target EJB is in the same cell on the same LPAR then the previously mentioned \\"local communications\\" function is used.  APIs  There are 13 APIs, categorized into the following categories: * General Setup and Teardown -- BBOA1REG (register) and BBOA1URG (unregister) * Inbound Basic -- BBOA1INV (invoke with automatic get response) * Inbound Advanced -- BBOA1CNG (get connection), BBOA1SRQ (send request), BBOA1RCL (get response length), BBOA1GET (get message data), BBOA1CNR (release connection) * Outbound Basic -- BBOA1SRV (host a service), BBOA1SRP (send response) * Outbound Advanced -- BBOA1RCA (receive on connection any), BBOA1RCS (receive on connection specific), BBOA1GET (get message data), BBOA1SRP (send response) and BBOA1SRX (send an exception) The InfoCenter has a full write-up of each along with parameter lists and return code (RC) and reason codes (RSN). Search on cdat_olaapis. = Illustrations of Common API Patterns = A common inbound API usage model would be: Simple In this case the BBOA1REG API is used to register into the WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Daemon group (the cell short name), and multiple invocations of BBOA1INV are used to invoke the target EJB. BBOA1INV is synchronous so program control is held until the EJB returns a response. This API is useful when the calling program knows the size of the response message in advance. If the response message size is unknown at the time of the call then the more primitive APIs (BBOA1SRQ (send request), BBOA1RCL (get response length), BBOA1GET (get message data)) would be more appropriate. When the calling program determines it has finished its work, it uses BBOA1URG to unregister from the Daemon group. If the target Java program has a longer response interval then an asynchronous model is likely better. The following picture illustrates how an asynchronous call would be done using what is known as the primitive API: BBOA1SRQ with the async=1 parameter set: Image:OLA_More_Advanced_Inbound_API.jpg As the picture illustrates, the asynchronous mode allows the non-Java program to get control and do other processing. That implies checking for a response at some future point. BBOA1RCL is used for that purpose. In this example BBOA1RCL is issued synchronously (parameter async=0). If a response is available BBOA1RCL will provide the length and program control returns to the program. If no response is available BBOA1RCL holds program control until one is available. BBOA1RCL with async=1 will return x'FFFFFFFF' if no response is available; program control is returned immediately. Other illustrations for outbound may be found in the WP101490 document found on the IBM Techdocs website. Note: Outbound from WAS to CICS would not require API coding. In that case the supplied BBO$/BBO# link server transactions would do that processing. Those link server transactions \\"host a service\\" using the internal constructs similar to the BBOA1SRV API. Outbound to a batch program would require the use of the APIs to \\"host a service.\\"  Transactionality  The Optimized Local Adapters support two-phase commit (2PC) processing from CICS inbound to WAS. With the advent of maintenance 7.0.0.12, the Optimized Local adapters also support two- phase commit outbound from WAS to CICS. Prior to 7.0.0.12 the transactional support from WAS to CICS was limited to \\"sync on return.\\" For IMS, support for transactional assertion inbound to WAS from IMS dependent regions was provided in fixpack 8.0.0.4 and 8.5.0.1. Transaction assertion outbound from WAS to IMS over WOLA/OTMA provided in fixpack 8.0.0.5. Transactional propagation is not supported inbound or outbound to batch, USS or Airlines Line Control.  Security  The Optimized Local Adapters are capable of asserting identity in the following circumstances: * WAS --> CICS : The identity on the WAS thread used to call the WOLA API can be used to assert identity into CICS. In order to do this, the WOLA CICS link server must be used and started with the SEC=Y parameter and the CICS region must be running with SEC=YES and the ID the link server task runs under must have SURROGAT SAF authority to start transactions on behalf of the propagated user ID. Refer to the IBM InfoCenter for more details on this. * WAS --> Batch, USS or ALCS : no attempt to assert identity is made. The target process runs under the identity used when it was started. * CICS --> WAS : CICS can assert its region ID or the application user ID * Batch, USS or ALCS : The external process will attempt to assert its identity into WAS z/OS.  Limitations  The WAS z/OS Optimized Local Adapters can be used only within a given LPAR. It is a cross-memory mechanism and can not go between LPARs or off the machine.

The building houses the Segal Theatre, the Academy of Performing Arts, CinemaSpace, Studio, and the Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre.  History =The Saidye Bronfman Centre In 1967, the children of Saidye Bronfman gave the theatre to the local community in recognition of their mother's long association with and patronage of the arts.http://www.cjnews.com/culture/books-and-authors/new-book-tells-saidye- became-segal The building that houses the theatre was designed in 1967 by Montreal architect Phyllis Lambert, a daughter of Saidye Bronfman.https://www.archdaily.com/803681/phyllis-lambert-90-exhibition- examining-impact-influence-opens-cca-montreal The Segal Centre for Performing Arts Following the winding-down of the Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Foundation, in 2007 the Saidye Bronfman Centre was renamed the Segal Centre for Performing Arts in acknowledgement of the financial support of Leanor and Alvin Segal in partnership with the Bronfman family. Uniting theatre, music, dance, cinema and arts education under one roof, its mission is to promote the creation, production and presentation of professional artistic work, support emerging artists and foster intercultural understanding through the arts. The Segal Theatre is now an English-language theatre. It has expanded to become a nationally recognized venue for the performing arts with a focus on creation, innovation, diversity, and cross-cultural collaborations. Driven by a belief in the power of the arts to strengthen and connect communities, the Segal's programming emphasizes original interpretations of popular classics and contemporary works, new Canadian musicals, and engaging productions with universal appeal. In 2008, the Segal Theatre co-produced the original musical Houdini with the Montreal Highlights Festival (dir. Bryna Wasserman). It was remounted later that year by the Montreal International Jazz Festival, the first play ever to be featured at the Festival. It was wildly successful with both French and English audiences as well as critics. Other highlights include Sam Shepard‚Äôs Buried Child (2009) which was co- produced with theNational Arts Centre (NAC) and directed byPeter Hinton, Artistic Director of English Theatre at the NAC. Old Wicked Songs (2010, dir. Bryna Wasserman) by Jon Marans was co-produced with Th√©√¢tre du Rideau Vert and played in French as Une musique inqui√©tante before the original cast and crew moved to the Segal to perform the production in English. The Segal Centre has become a major player in the development and production of new Canadian musicals. In June 2015, the Centre premiered Belles Soeurs: The Musical based on the play by Michel Tremblay with book and lyrics by Ren√© Richard Cyr, music by Daniel B√©langer, English adaptation of book and lyrics by Neil Bartram and Brian Hill, and directed by Ren√© Richard Cyr. A co-production with Copa de Oro, Belles Soeurs went on a national tour and won the Capital Critics Circle Award for Best Production after its stop at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. In June, 2015, the Segal Centre launched a world premiere of a musical adaptation of Mordecai Richler's novel, The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, starring Alberta-born Kenneth James Stewart as the infamous Duddy, who follows his grandfather's advice to own some land, regardless of the personal consequences.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/theatre-and- performance/adapting-duddy-kravitz/article24649544/ In October 2016, the Segal Centre premiered Prom Queen: The Musical based on the true story of Marc Hall, the Ontario teenager who took his Catholic School Board to court when it refused to let him attend prom with his boyfriend. Produced by Marcia Kash with book by Kent Staines, lyrics by Akiva Romer-Segal, music by Colleen Dauncey, musical direction by Mark Camilleri, choreography by Sean Cheesman, Prom Queen: The Musical won the Playwrights Guild of Canada‚Äôs Stage West Pechet Family Musical Award at the Tom Hendry Awards in 2016. The Segal Centre is also an artistic resource and hub for Montreal‚Äôs diverse theatre community of independent and emerging artists to create explore and grow. Its second stage, The Studio, has been a venue for SideMart Theatrical Grocery; the Power Jazz series; and the Segal‚Äôs popular Broadway Caf√© events, as well as guest programming. In addition, the Segal Centre for Performing Arts houses the Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre, celebrating almost sixty years of dramatizing the Jewish experience. The current Artistic Director is Lisa Rubin, who took up the position in 2014. Mandate The Segal Centre for Performing Arts is a not-for-profit theatre company dedicated to nurturing, producing and presenting world-class English-language theatre, and to showcasing professional artists from Montreal and around the world. Founded in 1967, the Segal Centre has expanded to become a nationally recognized venue for the performing arts, a training ground for emerging artists and a one-of-a-kind destination for the best of jazz concerts, dance, cinema and Jewish arts and culture.

The closest populated town is Halls Creek. The area was settled by European pastoralists in the 19th century but the community was established in 1901 when the state government built a ration depot at Turkey Creek. The Ngalangangpum School was established in town at the request of the community. Built in 1979, the school allowed students to stay in town rather than attend St Joseph's school in Wyndham and only come home over the holidays. The school was significantly upgraded in 1987, then again in 1990 so secondary schooling could occur in town, and again in 2001. Native title The traditional owners of the area are the Gija people. Governance The community is managed through its incorporated body, Warmun Community (Turkey Creek) Incorporated, which was incorporated under the Associations Incorporation Act, 1895-1969 (WA) in 1977. Mistake Creek massacre In March 1915, Michael Rhatigan, a telegraph linesman based at Turkey Creek, together with his two Aboriginal employees, Joe Wynne and Nipper, shot dead twelve Gija people at Mistake Creek in the East Kimberley. They initially rushed an Aboriginal camp killing six men, burning their remains. Six women were later rounded up and shot dead. A police squad was sent to track down and capture Rhatigan and his accomplices. Rhatigan and Nipper were arrested while Wynne was shot dead by police. A coroner's inquest held at Turkey Creek acquitted Rhatigan of any wrongdoing, while Nipper was ordered to face trial for the murder of eight people. Nipper was found not guilty and was released. He later worked at the police stables in Perth. According to local Aboriginal oral history, the massacre was in reprisal for the killing of Rhatigan's cow; the cow was later claimed to have been found alive after the massacre had already taken place. Members of the Gija people from the Warmun community have depicted the massacre in their artworks. Michael Rhatigan remained a telegraph linesman at Turkey Creek until his death in 1920. His son, John Rhatigan, became a long serving Labor Party politician in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly.

The route runs from an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80) and I-376 in Shenango Township to an intersection with U.S. Route 62 Business (US 62 Bus.) and PA 718 in Sharon. The road was designated as the northernmost part of PA 60 until 2009, when I-376 was extended from the Pittsburgh area to I-80 along PA 60. Route description PA 760 begins at an interchange with I-80 and I-376 in Shenango Township, heading to the west as a four-lane freeway. South of here, the road continues as I-376. A short distance after beginning, the route reaches the PA 18 interchange, at which point the freeway ends. From this point, PA 760 turns to the northwest and becomes two-lane undivided Broadway Avenue. The road enters Hermitage and passes a mix of woods and industrial establishments. The route turns more to the west as it comes into Wheatland and intersects PA 718 and the southern terminus of PA 418. At this intersection, PA 718 forms a concurrency with PA 760, and the two routes pass residential areas to the north and industrial areas to the south with a few businesses. The road enters Farrell and turns to the north, continuing to the west of developed neighborhoods and to the east of a Norfolk Southern railroad line as it passes more industry, including a large steel mill. PA 718/PA 760 crosses into Sharon, where the road becomes Dock Street and passes under US 62, with a connection provided by local streets. From here, the road continues into downtown Sharon and reaches a roundabout at Connelly Boulevard and an intersection with US 62 Business. At this junction, PA 760 ends and PA 718 makes a left turn to head west on US 62 Business. History What is now PA 760 was originally designated as solely PA 718 and as an unnumbered road east of the PA 418/PA 718 intersection though the portion south of the PA 18 intersection was part of PA 18 constructed as a bypass of West Middlesex. When the PA 60 freeway was completed up to I-80, the PA 60 designation was applied onto this stretch of road. After I-376 was extended up the PA 60 freeway to I-80 from the Pittsburgh area in November 2009, PA 60 was reduced to its current alignment in Allegheny County while the former PA 60 north of I-80 became PA 760.

It follows the story of a young boy named Tommy who is trying to figure out if Dwight's Origami Yoda is actually real or it's a hoax that Dwight created. It became the first in a series of popular Star Wars themed novels penned by Angleberger, which includes Darth Paper Strikes Back!, The Secret of the Fortune Wookiee, The Surprise Attack of Jabba the Puppett, Princess Labelmaker to the Rescue, and Emperor Pickletine Rides the Bus as well as an activity book titled ART2-D2's Guide to Folding and Doodling. There is also a rare art book with Han Foldo on it. The Strange Case of Origami Yoda was nominated for the Illinois State 2013 Rebecca Caudil Award. Plot Dwight is a sixth grader at McQuarrie Middle School who is considered quite weird. One day, Dwight folds an origami finger puppet of Yoda, a popular Star Wars figure. Through an imitation voice, Dwight offers advice to his classmates through Yoda. Some students at McQuarrie soon become convinced that Origami Yoda has a special connection to the Force , while others remain skeptical. A fellow sixth-grader named Tommy decides to write a case file to prove if Origami Yoda is real. He convinces a number of students to write about their experiences with Origami Yoda, while his friend Kellen illustrates the file. However, Harvey, who has always been cruel to Dwight and is skeptical about Origami Yoda's wisdom, attempts to disprove Origami Yoda's connection to the [Force]. Inspiration Angleberger has stated that partial inspiration for the book came from Origami artist Fumiaki Kawahata, whose origami Yoda has been seen on the Web. Inspiration also came from the unique style of writing associated with Star Wars. The name of McQuarrie Middle School is a reference to Star Wars artist Ralph McQuarrie, who seems to have heavily influenced Angleberger. Main characters The main characters in the book are Tommy, Dwight, Kellen, Yoda and Harvey. Darth Paper Created by Harvey Cunningham, an antagonist of book 2, Darth Paper Strikes Back. He teases Tommy and gets Dwight suspended. He is behind an unannounced grand scheme. Ultimately, he turns to the Light side and becomes Origami Anakin. Origami Yoda Dwight's finger puppet that he brings to McQuarrie Middle School. He is known for being able to predict the future using the \\"force\\". How to fold origami yoda: the instructions are in The Strange Case of Origami Yoda by Tom Angleberger. However, we don't ever get to know how to fold the actual origami yoda, just the simple one that Dwight created. Also there is an instruction for a five- fold origami Yoda in the next case file - Darth Paper Strikes Back, also by Tom Angleberger. Harvey Cunningham The main antagonist of the first two books, Harvey, is focused on a single goal ‚Äî to prove that Origami Yoda is not real. Harvey always complains and insults everyone. The creator of Darth Paper, he repeatedly boasts that his Darth Vader imitation is better than Dwight's Yoda imitation. He was Tommy and Kellen's best friend at the beginning of the first book but they turned against him, as they are fed up with him criticizing everyone. He writes a comment at the end of almost every story. In Book 3, Harvey turns to supporting Tommy, Kellen, and Dwight with some of his end comments, even to the point of adding his own contribution to the mini Dwight Case File. Principal Rabbski The principal of McQuarrie Middle School and the main antagonist of The Secret of the Fortune Wookiee and The Surprise Attack of Jabba the Puppett. She wants students to focus on the fundamentals to do well on the Standards of Learning Test. In the next book Princess Labelmaker changes her mind and changes sides. She is Polish American. Reception Barbara Schultz of Common Sense Media gave the book a rating of four out of five stars, and described it as \\"Funny, [and] charming. Kirkus Reviews praised the humor and described the book as, \\"A skewed amalgam of Wayside Stories and Wimpy Kid that is sure to please fans of both.\\" Elizabeth Kennedy of ThoughtCo described the book as clever, amusing, and unique. Elizabeth Bird of Fuse 8 Production called the book as Angleberger's best work, described it as a companion piece to the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, and praised how the book can be enjoyed by all genders, the Star Wars aspects of the story, the character Dwight's arc with how it discusses tolerance of people who may relate to a stereotypical geek, and the different references and allusions made throughout, but criticized the references made to American Idol. Sequels Five sequels have been released, as well as an activity book. Darth Paper Strikes Back! Published in 2011 The first sequel, Darth Paper Strikes Back (), takes place one year after the events of The Strange Case of Origami Yoda. The book includes instructions for a simpler version of Darth Paper (whose designer is known as Super-folder Ben), as well a 5-fold version of Origami Yoda \\"It is a dark time at Ralph McQuarrie middle school. After suffering several Origami Yoda-related humiliations, Harvey manages to get Dwight suspended from school for being a \\"troublemaker.\\" Origami Yoda pleads with Tommy and Kellen to save Dwight by making a new case file-one that will show that Dwight's presence benefits McQuarrie. With the help of their friends, Tommy and Kellen record cases such as \\"Origami Yoda and the Pre-eaten wiener,\\"\\"Origami Yoda and the Exploding Pizza Bagels,\\" and \\"Origami Yoda and Wonderland: The Musical.\\" But Harvey and his Darth Paper puppet have a secret plan that could make Dwight's suspension permanent...\\" An emergency Origami Yoda, along with a simple version of Darth Paper, is featured as a guest star and a how-to-fold. The Secret of the Fortune Wookiee Published in 2012 The third book In the series, The Secret of the Fortune Wookiee (), takes place immediately after Darth Paper Strikes Back! The summary from Amazon.com reads: With Dwight attending Tippett Academy this semester, the kids of McQuarrie are on their own, no Yoda to help them navigate the treacherous waters of school. Then Sara gets a gift from Dwight; a cootie catcher (fortune teller) in the form of Chewbacca. It's a Fortune Wookiee, and it seems to give just as good advice as Yoda, even if, in the hands of the girls, it seems too preoccupied with romance. In the meantime, Dwight is fitting in at Tippett a little too well, and it's up to his old friends at McQuarrie to remind their buddy that it's in his oddness that his greatness lies. The book includes instructions to make Chewbacca Fortune Wookiee and Han Foldo finger puppets. ART2-D2's Guide to Folding and Doodling The activity book () was published in 2013. It contains a narrative linking four main sections describing how to draw and create origami characters from the book series. It also includes origami paper for folding. It does not have any part in the series with the exception of the introduction of several new origami characters like C3PO, Art2D2, kirigami general grevious, Harvey's darth paper, and more! The Surprise Attack of Jabba the Puppett! Published in 2013 The fourth book in the Origami Yoda series, The Surprise Attack of Jabba the Puppett! (), takes place almost immediately after The Secret of The Fortune Wookiee. The summary on Amazon.com reads: Dark times have fallen on McQuarrie Middle School this semester. Dwight's back‚Äîand not a moment too soon‚Äîas Kellen, Sara and the gang face a new Menace: the FunTime Educational Program. FunTime is supposed to raise students' test scores; instead, it's driving everyone at McQuarrie crazy with its obnoxious Professor FunTime and his insidious singing calculator. When Principal Rabbski cancels the students' field trip‚Äîalong with art, music and Lego classes‚Äîto make room for FunTime, the students turn to Origami Yoda for help. But some crises are too big for Origami Yoda to handle alone: Form a Rebel Alliance the students must. With this latest Episode in the explosively popular Origami Yoda series, Tom Angleberger proves once again that he \\"has his finger puppet squarely on the erratic pulse of middle-school life\\". The book includes instructions for Ewok and Jabba the Puppett finger puppets. Princess Labelmaker to the Rescue The FunTime menace is still not defeated, so a mysterious character by the name of Princess Labelmaker gives the case file to Rabbski to explain that the FunTime menace is evil and to request for Rabsski's help. Later on, Princess Labelmaker is collected by Rabbski. At a meeting, Rabbski and the Alliance fight against the school board and save their electives, as well as their field trip to Washington. But who was Princess Labelmaker? The book contains instructions on how to fold Luke, Leia, and in some copies, Obi-Wan. Emperor Pickletine Rides the Bus This is the final concluding book of the series. The book contains instructions for Emperor Pickletine and Flying Vader.

It is a pale yellow solid. 4-Nitrochlorobenzene is a common intermediate in the production of a number of industrially useful compounds, including common antioxidants found in rubber. Other isomers with the formula ClC6H4NO2 include 2-nitrochlorobenzene and 3-nitrochlorobenzene. Preparation 4-Nitrochlorobenzene is prepared industrially by nitration of chlorobenzene: \\\\mathrm{ClC_6H_5 + HNO_3 \\\\rightarrow ClC_6H_4NO_2 + H_2O} This reaction affords both the 2- and the 4-nitro derivatives, in about a 1:2 ratio. These isomers are separated by distillation. 4-Nitrochlorobenzene was originally prepared by the nitration of 4-bromochlorobenzene by Holleman and coworkers.\\"The nitration of mixed dihalogen benzenes\\" Recueil des Travaux Chimiques des Pays-Bas et de la Belgique. Amsterdam, 1915; pp. 204-235. Applications 4-Nitrochlorobenzene is an intermediate in the preparation of a variety of derivatives. Nitration gives 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, and 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene. Reduction with iron metal gives 4-chloroaniline. The electron-withdrawing nature of the appended nitro-group makes the benzene ring especially susceptible to nucleophilic aromatic substitution, unlike related chlorobenzene. Thus, the strong nucleophiles hydroxide, methoxide, and amide displace chloride to give respectively 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitroanisole, 4-nitroaniline. Another major use of 4-nitrochlorobenzene is its condensation with aniline to produce 4-nitrodiphenylamine. Reductive alkylation of the nitro group affords secondary aryl amines, which are useful antioxidants for rubber. 4-Nitrochlorobenzene is the precursor to the anti-leprosy drug Dapsone (4-[(4-aminobenzene)sulfonyl]aniline). Safety The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health considers 4-nitrochlorobenzene as a potential occupational carcinogen that may be absorbed through the skin.CDC - Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): p-nitrochlorobenzene The Occupational Safety and Health Administration set a permissible exposure limit of 1 mg/m3, while the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists recommends an airborne exposure limit of 0.64 mg/m3, over a time-weighted average of eight hours.CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical HazardsNew Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services - Hazardous Substance Fact Sheet References Category:Chloroarenes Category:Nitrobenzenes ","title":"4-Nitrochlorobenzene"},{"id":"26949413","text":"1-(Diphenylmethyl)piperazine, also known as benzhydrylpiperazine, is a chemical compound and piperazine derivative.

Conference field trips include local and regional places of geographic and historical significance. An exhibit hall is staffed by government, industry, nonprofit, and academic organizations and offers the latest in books, journals, projects, curriculum, software, hardware, and more to support geography teaching. Each conference is highlighted by an annual keynote address. Past keynote speakers have included: From 1915 to the late 1970s the NCGE conference was held in a few select US cities. In 1979 the conference began rotating its location to a new North American city each year. Since 1979 the NCGE conference has been held in the following locations: Mexico City, Mexico (1979); Des Moines, IA (1980); Pittsburgh, PA (1981); San Diego, CA (1982); Ocho Rios, Jamaica (1983); Toronto, Ontario, Canada (1984); Breckenridge, CO (1985); Chicago, IL (1986); Springfield, MI (1987); Snowbird, UT (1988); Hershey, PA (1989); Williamsburg, VA (1990); St. Paul, MN (1991); Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (1992); Halifax, Nova Scotia (1993); Lexington, KY (1994); San Antonio, TX (1995); Santa Barbara, CA (1996); Orlando, FL (1997); Indianapolis, IN (1998); Boston, MA (1999); Chicago, IL (2000); Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (2001); Philadelphia, PA (2002); Salt Lake City, UT (2003); Kansas City, MO (2004); Birmingham, AL (2005); Lake Tahoe, NV (2006); Oklahoma City, OK (2007); Dearborn, MI (2008); San Juan, Puerto Rico (2009); Savannah, GA (2010); Portland, OR (2011); San Marcos, TX (2012); Denver, CO (2013); Memphis, TN (2014); Washington DC (2015); Tampa, FL (2016); Albuquerque, NM (2017); Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (2018).  Partnerships  The NCGE as an organization actively partners with other organizations, including the Association of American Geographers, The National Council for the Social Studies, and other organizations. Its members are active in the National Science Teachers Association, the North American Association for Environmental Education, the Geographical Association, and in other organizations. Many of its members are also active with the education program of the National Geographic Society and with the National Science Foundation. Some members are active in working with the U.S. Congress on bills and policy that strengthen geography education at all levels, most notably the \\"Teaching Geography Is Fundamental (TGIF)\\" Act.  Publications  The NCGE's weekly email newsletter is published each week. Its contents include geography education news, events, opportunities, and resources. The NCGE's journals include \\"Journal of Geography\\" and \\"The Geography Teacher.\\" The Journal has been published for nearly a century, beginning with a different name, while The Geography Teacher began in 2000. The Journal of Geography focuses on research in geography education. It is a scholarly, peer-reviewed journal designed for educators, offering the best in teaching and research advancements in geographic education. JOG publishes research on innovative approaches to teaching and learning, classroom tested lesson ideas, curriculum, book reviews, and more. The Geography Teacher's focus is on illustrating how geography can be taught in the classroom, through short articles, lesson plans, teaching tips, and news especially relevant for today‚Äôs primary, secondary, and pre-service teachers. Taylor and Francis is the publisher of these journals.  National Geography standards  NCGE partnered with the National Geographic Society, the Association of American Geographers, and the American Geographical Society during the 1990s to create the national standards for geography, entitled \\"Geography for Life\\" (1994). The content standards what students at specific educational levels should know and be expected to do by grades 4, 8, and 12. The National Standards in Geography are organized into 18 standards that encompass six elements. NCGE played a key role in revising and updating the national standards during the period 2008 to 2012, culminating in the publication of the updated geography standards in September 2012. Revised content captures the growth and importance of geospatial technologies and spatial thinking in geography over the last 18 years. Knowledge statements and performance statements are broken down by grade band (grades 4, 8 and 12).  Other projects  NCGE members created the Geography Map, a body of skills and exemplary activities, as part of the Partnership for 21st Century Skills. Members of the NCGE also work closely on joint publications, joint participation in conferences, and in research and curriculum development with other organizations, most notably the Geographical Association, the Association of American Geographers, the National Council for the Social Studies, and the North American Association for Environmental Education. The NCGE is also involved with an effort called the \\"Roadmap\\" project, funded by National Science Foundation to National Geographic, with a goal to create key documents that define what geographic literacy is and why it is important to education and society. NCGE holds a webinar series that is open to all and free to members. Topics include teaching with web-based Geographic Information Systems, teaching about the Erie Canal using digital maps, imagery, and geographic inquiry, place-based learning, field work techniques, methods of teaching Advanced Placement Human Geography (APHG), and more. These webinars are conducted by the experts in the respective topics and offer live training as well as the ability to watch the webinar recordings that have been archived.

It stars Eric Balfour, Scottie Thompson, Brittany Daniel, Crystal Reed, David Zayas, and Donald Faison as a group of Los Angeles residents who witness an alien invasion while in a condominium. The film was released on November 12, 2010, in the United States. Despite negative reviews from critics, Skyline was a box office success, grossing $68 million worldwide against its $10‚Äì20 million budget. The Strause brothers produced a sequel entitled Beyond Skyline, which was released in 2017. The third and last film in the trilogy, originally called Skylines and then Skylin3s, is scheduled to be released in 2020. Plot Jarrod and his wife Elaine arrived at Los Angeles, California for Jarrod's best friend Terry's birthday party. They celebrate with Terry's wife, Candice, and his assistant, Denise. During a private argument about whether or not they should move, Elaine reveals she is pregnant. The next morning, blue lights descend from the sky, hypnotizing anyone who looks at them. The light causes people to become zombie-like and immobilized; they are then collected by the light machines. Jarrod and Elaine's friend Ray is taken, but Jarrod is saved when Terry tackles him. He and Terry go to the condominium roof to investigate the lights but are attacked by one of hundreds of flying alien drones. As they attempt to open the rooftop door, Elaine quickly opens it from the other side, accidentally looks directly into the aliens' light and is hypnotized, but Jarrod and Terry are able to save her and close the door. Back in the condominium, Terry looks for his neighbor Walt so they can all leave in Walt's car. As Terry and Walt are hiding, Walt's dog runs towards the creature and Walt tries to stop it but he gets abducted. Jarrod believes the open water would be a safer place, since there are no machines over the sea. They encounter a bickering couple, Colin and Jen, also preparing to flee the building. As Terry's car exits the garage, it is flattened by a massive four-legged alien, killing Denise. Terry escapes, but is abducted as he flees. The trio retreat into the garage, where they encounter another alien lifeform in the shape of a large multi-tentacled squid that takes Colin. It corners the rest of the group before the building's concierge, Oliver, slams into it with an SUV and finds Colin alive. When they try to free him, the squid creature comes back to life, sucking out Colin's brain and regaining its energy. As they run back into the building, Jen is abducted. The four survivors remain hiding in the condominium. The next day, the United States Air Force launches an attack against the alien spaceship and flying alien drones using stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicles and conventional drone aircraft armed with air-to-air missiles (a \\"jet engine\\" powered MQ-9 Reaper). Only one stealth plane (an X-47B) pierces the carnage and fires a nuclear missile, hitting the mothership, before it is destroyed. The detonation blows the ship apart and kills the aliens, but Jarrod discovered the aliens have survived and the ship slowly begins to repair itself. After Jarrod tells Elaine that the alien light made him feel powerful, he is adamant that safety must be found outside. Oliver wants to stay inside and tries restraining him. Jarrod physically starts changing as he lifts Oliver off the floor and vows that he will protect his family. Helicopters arrive with soldiers as Jarrod and Elaine go to the roof hoping to catch a ride to safety. Oliver and Candice stay in the condominium, but are found when Candice accidentally exposes herself to the light and is abducted. Afterwards, Oliver attempts to kill a tanker alien by turning on a gas stove and igniting a lighter, causing the room to explode. The soldiers are thrown off the roof by the aliens and a squid alien attacks Jarrod and Elaine; the badly injured Jarrod kills it. Amid the aliens, they accept their fate, look into the blue light, and are sucked into the mother ship. A brief montage shows that cities such as London, Hong Kong and New York City, have all succumbed to the invasion and the aliens appear to have won. Inside the alien ship, Elaine wakes on a pile of human bodies. Tubes are sucking human brains into machines; probes go through the pile looking for what they can find. Elaine sees Jarrod in the pile but has to watch helplessly as his brain is removed. She is probed, but left alone since she is pregnant. Elaine is transported to another chamber where other pregnant women have been sent. Meanwhile, Jarrod's brain, glowing red instead of the usual aliens' blue, is inserted into a new alien body. Animating the alien body, Jarrod seems to retain control, and comes to the aid of Elaine and their unborn child. Elaine recognizes him when he caresses her belly and her head. He then turns around to confront advancing aliens, and in between the credits, a series of still images depict \\"Jarrod\\" protecting Elaine and their child from the aliens. Cast * Eric Balfour as Jarrod * Scottie Thompson as Elaine * Brittany Daniel as Candice * Crystal Reed as Denise * Neil Hopkins as Ray * David Zayas as Oliver * Donald Faison as Terry * Robin Gammell as Walt * Tanya Newbould as Jen * J. Paul Boehmer as Colin Production The project began filming in Marina Del Rey in February 2010 through March 31. Most of the action was shot in the high-rise condo in which Greg Strause lives. The physical production cost only $500,000. With all the visual effects the total budget was around $10‚Äì20 million. On November 11, 2010, producer Brett Ratner said on the Opie and Anthony Show that the film cost $10 million to make. The Brothers Strause insisted that they would film a sequel with their own money and try to find a distributor to release it. Legal action from Sony In August 2010 it was reported that Sony Pictures Entertainment was contemplating legal action against the Strause brothers, the directors of Skyline, and the owners of Hydraulx Filmz. Sony paid Hydraulx to generate visual effects work for Battle: Los Angeles. But Hydraulx never informed Sony the siblings were directing a rival alien invasion feature, similarly driven by special effects, scheduled for release four months prior to Sony's feature. A rep for the Strauses issued a statement: \\"Any claims of impropriety are completely baseless. This is a blatant attempt by Sony to force these independent filmmakers to move a release date that has long been set by Universal and Relativity and is outside the filmmakers' control\\". On March 17, 2011, Sony released a statement dismissing its arbitration against Hydraulx and the Strause Brothers, saying that after the discovery phase they were satisfied that none of the Battle: Los Angeles visual effects were used in Skyline. The Strause brothers stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad to put this behind us. We‚Äôve been honored to work on several wonderful SPE projects in the past and look forward to future collaborations.‚Äù Music Composer Matthew Margeson is a colleague of Brian Tyler, who served as one of the film's executive producers. Release The film was released on November 12, 2010 in North America and November 11 in Australia, and was distributed by Universal Pictures. Following the theatrical release, the movie was to run on Netflix. A trailer was released August 13 and attached to Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and Devil. The second trailer was released on September 29 and then attached to My Soul to Take on October 15. Another trailer was also attached to Paranormal Activity 2.

When it was released, it was panned by critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 16% based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 3.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"A middling sci-fi entry, Skyline offers proof that solid special effects alone cannot overcome a flat storyline filled with uninspired dialogue.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 26 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"D‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Writing in Variety, Joe Leydon panned the film: \\"Imagine a Kmart mash-up of Transformers and Independence Day and you're appropriately primed for Skyline, an underwhelming and derivative sci-fi thriller that's only marginally more impressive than a run-of-the-mill SyFy Channel telepic.\\" Michael Philips of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the \\"effects are pretty good, on a fairly limited budget. And that's about all you can say for Skyline.\\" Screen Rant's Ben Kendrick wrote that the film \\"comes across as a big-screen B-movie with a convoluted plot and too limited of a scope to make the audience feel the worldwide alien-apocalypse that‚Äôs supposedly unfolding in the film\\". In the New York Times, Mike Hale concluded, \\"it turns out that all the running and hiding and chopping (there‚Äôs an axe) was beside the point, which is the sort of thing that can make you angry if you care about the characters, but in this case is kind of a relief.\\" There were some positive reviews, including Matthew Sorrento's at Film Threat, who commented, \\"Skyline, if not always successful, refashions the modern alien invasion motif as the hopeless siege that it should be.\\" Kim Newman from Empire Magazine also endorsed the film, writing, \\"... delivers all the Saturday night whiz-bang and Sunday morning brain- ripping you could want.\\" Box office Skyline opened on November 12, 2010 and grossed $4,737,555 on its opening day from 2,880 theaters for a 1-day average of $1,645 per theater. It grossed a total of $11,692,415 over its opening weekend from 2,880 theaters for a 3-day average of $4,060 per theater, and ranking #4 for the weekend behind Megamind at #1, Unstoppable at #2, and Due Date at #3. , the film made $21,416,355 in the United States and $46,848,618 internationally for a worldwide total of $68,264,973.

He alone contributed some 206 poems, or a little less than 10% of the entire Sangam-era classical corpus by 473 ancient poets. Held in high regard by other poets of the Sangam era, as well as the post-Sangam era, he is variously dated to have lived between c. 50‚Äì125 CE, or 140‚Äì200 CE. He was a contemporary of Karikala Chola, Irunk≈çvƒìl and Vƒìl PƒÅri. He was the close friend, confidant and alleged favorite of Vƒìl PƒÅri, one of the Vƒìlir kings.Studies in Tamil Literature and History by Ramachandra Dikshitar, pages 55-59 He was the author of Inna Narpathu, a didactic work of the Sangam literature. Verse 5 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai is also attributed to him. Early life Kapilar was born in Thiruvadhavur in the Pandyan Kingdom. Initially a poet at the Pandyan court, he left Madurai at an early age to travel across various kingdoms. Kapilar heard about the generosity and virtue of Vƒìl PƒÅri, a powerful Vƒìlir King who ruled over ParambunƒÅdu and paid him a visit. He became a friend and confidant of PƒÅri and stayed with him until the latter's death, serving as the chief poet and minister at the PƒÅri's court. Kowmareeshwari suggests he was born about mid 1st-century CE, while Martha Ann Shelby states he most likely was born about 140 CE. Kapilar has sung on King Selva Kadungovaliyadhan, which appears as the seventh group of verses in the Pathitrupathu. The king honoured Kapilar with 100,000 gold coins and a country under his control. Kapilar remained close with other contemporary poets such as Avvaiyar I and Paranar. Siege of Parambu The three crowned Tamil kings Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas expanded their kingdoms ruthlessly and turned their attention towards independent Vƒìlir Kings thus turning them into subordinates or eliminating them to annexe their kingdoms. They laid siege to the heavily fortified country of Parambu, but Vƒìl PƒÅri refused to give in and the war dragged for years. Kabilar approached the kings and asked them to turn back describing his patron Pari as an unconquerable warrior (excerpt from Purananuru: song 109): After a long war, Vƒìl PƒÅri was killed by treachery.Great women of India, page 309 Purananuru, song (112) of PƒÅri's daughters on his death: Aftermath and death Kabilar rock on the Ponnaiyar River near Tirukoilur, Viluppuram district, Tamil Nadu, India. Kapilar become the guardian of PƒÅri's two daughters, Angavai and Sangavai, after Pari's death and the three of them left Parambu country. Kapilar unsuccessfully approached different Vƒìlir kings to find grooms. He would be let down each time as the other Vƒìlir kings would fear retribution from the three crowned kingdoms. The most notable of these encounters is when he sings to Irunk≈çvƒìl and the latter would insult Kabilar. He would finally leave the two princesses in the care of \\"Andhanars\\". Later, poet Avvaiyar takes care of them and marries them off successfully into the family of another Vƒìlir king Malaiyamaan Kaari. The death of his friend PƒÅri affected Kapilar and he later took his own life by vadakirrutal, one of the Tamil ways of committing suicide. He sat facing north and starved himself to death in Kabilar Kundru.The Four Hundred Songs of War and Wisdom: An Anthology of Poems from Classical Tamil, the Purananuru, Translations from the Asian classics By George L. Hart, Hank Heifetz Works and contribution Kabilar made huge contributions to Tamil literature of Sangam era. Kurincippattu is a poetic work in the Ten Idylls series of the Eighteen Greater Texts anthology in Tamil literature containing 261 lines of poems in the Achiriyappa meter written by Kabilar. An ancient note states that Kapilar wrote this to explain the beauty of Tamil poetry to a north Indian king names Brhadatta. Kurincippattu describes the kurinchi landscape of the mountainous terrain and mentions almost 100 different plant names. Kabilar also contributed to Pu·πüanƒÅ·πâ≈´·πüu in the Eight Anthologies series of sangam literature. Kapilar used unique metaphors that show the interior landscape using the objects seen in the 'Kurinchi' landscape. 'Veral veli' written by Kapilar is considered as one of the master pieces. Views on Valluvar and the Kural Kapilar is believed to have accompanied Valluvar in his journey to the Madurai College of scholars to present the latter‚Äôs work, the Tirukkural.

He was known for his stylistically unique approach to the genre which brought college students back to pink film theaters at this time, when Nikkatsu's Roman Porno series was beginning to lose its popularity among this audience. In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser give Girl Mistress three-and-a-half out of four stars. Without stating what award the film won, they note that it is an \\"award- winning motion picture\\". Director Takahashi had already made a name for himself in the pink film through his films at K≈çji Wakamatsu's production company, such as Raping the Sisters (1977) and Japanese Inquisition (1978), and films made at his own company, such as Attacking Girls and Scandal: Pleasure Trap (both 1979). However, according to the Weissers, Girl Mistress is the film which cemented his name in the history of pink cinema.

The initiative was launched in 2007 by president Rafael Correa which offered a perpetual suspension of oil extraction in part of the Yasuni National Park called Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) in return for payments of $3.6 billion from the international community (half of what Ecuador would have realized in revenue from exploiting the resources at 2007 prices). It envisioned the transition to a sustainable economy, using the funds to create jobs in such sectors as renewable energy while respecting the region's biodiversity and social equality. However by 2012 only $200 million had been pledged and by 2013 the plan had abandoned and drilling started in 2016.*Vogel, J.H. (2009). The economics of the Yasun√≠ Initiative: climate change as if thermodynamics mattered. London, Anthem Press The aim of the initiative was to conserve biodiversity, protect indigenous peoples living in voluntary isolation, and avoid the release of CO2 emissions. The Yasuni-ITT Trust Fund was officially launched on 3 August 2010. The reserve had around 846 million barrels or 20% of the country's proven oil reserve. After receiving pledges totalling $200 million by 2012, the Ecuadorian government announced that it would move forward with the Yasuni-ITT Initiative. However, in July 2013, Ecuador's president Rafael Correa's commission on the Yasuni-ITT Initiative's progress, the commission concluded that economic results were insufficient, leading Correa to scrap the plan on August 15, 2013. , campaign groups were still attempting to save Yasun√≠-ITT from oil activities but ultimately failed.  History  The Yasuni-ITT Initiative was launched by president Rafael Correa of Ecuador at the U.N. General Assembly in 2007. The Yasuni-ITT Initiative sought to prevent the drilling of oil in the Ishpingo- Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) oil field within the Yasuni National Park. The Yasuni National Park, located on the eastern edge of Ecuador, encompasses a section of Ecuador's Amazon Rainforest and is recognized as one of the most bio diverse regions in the world; as well as the home of several indigenous Amazonian tribes. An initial proposal to promote the sustainable development of the renewable resources of the National Parks in the Amazon rainforest of Ecuador, rather than extracting non-renewable oil resources, was published in 1994 by Luis Fierro.Comparative Valuation of Renewable Amenity Resources and Exhaustible Oil Resources: The Case of National Parks in the Ecuadorian Rainforest. Working Paper No. 4. Quito, Ecuador: Multiplica Consulting Firm, 1994 However, the Yasuni National Park is estimated to contain approximately 846 million barrels of crude oil, approximately 20% of the country's proven oil reserves. To prevent the environmental destruction caused as a result of oil exploitation, the government of Ecuador proposed a permanent ban on oil production inside the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini oil field in exchange for 50% of the value of the reserves, or $3.6 billion over 13 years to be raised from public and private contributions from the international community. By preventing the drilling of oil inside the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini oil field, the Yasuni-ITT Initiative sought to conserve the biodiversity of the region, protect the indigenous peoples currently living in voluntary isolation inside the Yasuni National Park, and avoid the emission of significant quantities of CO2 caused by oil production. To administer the funds donated to the Yasuni-ITT Initiative, the Yasuni-ITT Trust Fund was officially launched on 3 August 2010. The Yasuni-ITT Trust Fund was administered by the Multi- Partner Trust Fund of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The Yasuni-ITT Initiative was to be considered an unprecedented victory for the environmental community as the first large-scale carbon abatement project carried out by a developing country with cooperation from the international community. In August 2013, however, Ecuador's President Correa canceled the initiative.  Benefits of the initiative = Preserving biodiversity  Yasuni National Park is one of the most biologically diverse areas on earth. Scientists have discovered 655 species of trees in one hectare of land in the park, more than the total record of the US and Canada combined. It has been declared a world biosphere reserve by UNESCO. Some 4,000-plant species, 173 species of mammals and 610 bird species live inside the Park. \\"It contains more documented insect species than any other forest in the world, and is among the most diverse forests in the world for different species of birds, bats, amphibians, epiphytes, and lianas. Yasun√≠ is critical habitat to 23 globally threatened mammal species, including the Giant otter, the Amazonian manatee, Pink river dolphin, Giant anteater, and Amazonian tapir... Ten primate species live in the Yasun√≠, including the threatened White-bellied spider monkey.\\" Earth Economics has estimated that its environmental benefits would have a net present value of 9.89 billion dollars. It was also estimated that the environmental costs of oil production in the ITT would be at least US$1.25 billion in present terms. This latter estimate includes only the effects of deforestation, the loss of ecotourism potential and the non-timber- related services of the forest, and excludes a number of externalities of oil exploitation like spills, local pollution, and effects on public health.http://yasuni-itt.gob.ec/wp- content/uploads/initiative_change_history_sep.pdf Currently, there has been some drilling in the Yasuni area, which has caused deforestation, air, and water pollution. Oil roads into the forest have become a magnet for colonization and opened up the park to over-hunting and deforestation. There are hundreds of waste oil \\"lakes\\" in the forest.  Avoiding CO2 emissions  Leaving the oil underground avoids the emission of 410 million metric tons of CO2. Carbon dioxide in Ecuador has led to degradation and deforestation to the ecological system. Contribution from the international community can help to develop reforestation to avoid petroleum energy. Environmental impacts Media coverage and legal documentation are limited when it comes to oil spills in the Amazon. Petro Ecuador has been notorious at having more than 400 spills a year. The government needs to do due diligence, to make sure that oil companies change their management and especially their extraction practice to avoid oil spills. Social, cultural, and political impacts The main group of individuals that will become most affected is the indigenous groups. Many foreign oil and gas companies have bribed with narcotics and liquor. The Ecuadorian indigenous do not possess the means to fight off against the foreign oil companies.  The history of the protection of indigenous people in voluntary isolation  Historically the Waorani, a semi-nomadic group of hunter-gatherers, have lived in the Yasun√≠ National Park for centuries. However, after the introduction of Royal-Dutch-Shell workers in 1930 that lead missionaries to this land, the only remaining part of the Wanorani are the Tagaeri and the Taromenane. As oil mongers continued to come into their land as the years went on, the Waorani established the \\"Organization of Waorani Nationalities of Ecuador\\" (ONHAE) to expand their rights. The ONHAE requested that the government of Ecuador grant the Waorani legal title over their territory. They wanted control over their land so that they could bring the harmful oil exploitation in their land to a halt. However, the government saw the Waorani opposition to oil activities as harmful to the modernization of Ecuador. Oil companies used the justification that Ecuador's development was dependent on oil extraction to further their projects. However, as oil companies like Maxus continued to build roads to aid in their extraction efforts the Waorani claimed that the company was \\"destroying everything in their path: our culture, our territory, and our lives.\\" Their cry for help in the form of an \\"oil moratorium\\" gained the attention of NGOs concerned with the biodiversity of the rainforest, and it led to the Amazonia por la Vida (Amazon for Life), which brought environmental problems in the Amazon to the forefront of the media. This began the open discourse between the Waorani against oil activities in their land. Before oil exploitation began, however, the Ecuadorian government enacted the doctrine of terra nullius, a racist doctrine that provided legal justification for Europeans to annex territories that were inhabited by indigenous people. The terra nullius asserted legal and political rule over the indigenous and gave them no property or political rights. It claimed that they were \\"savages\\" who could not exercise political power over their land. Thus, the land was claimed by Europeans who exercised control over the indigenous populations and began oil extraction without consent or compensation to the local peoples. In the early 1960s, oil companies ignored local land rights, failed to mitigate pollution/damage to the Amazon, and allowed for the process of colonization of the Amazon to begin. All of these issues combined stripped indigenous people of large areas of their territory and endangered their cultural and economic way of life. In their opposition, local residents sought to participate fully in discussions with multi-national oil companies and national governments on the issue. While this discourse did not blossom fully in the 1960s, by the 1990s the political pressure that oil companies faced completely changed the way things were done. Oil companies and governments now had to pay attention to the social and environmental impacts of extraction and long-term interests of local communities. A middle ground between the Waorani way of life and governmental and oil company's interests were created. To create this middle ground the Waorani learned new languages, traveled to the United States, met with industry and government officials, created new indigenous federations and political practices, engaged with international science, and modified long- standing social and economic practices. Through these actions a discourse was created, leaving the old one-sided exploitation of the indigenous lands in the past. Although the Waorani still did not have complete control of their land and their destiny, the middle ground had given them some influence over their fate. The native people also seek employment in the oil industry, access to oil markets, and long-term investment in health centers, schools, and community development. However, they struggled to establish good conditions for new projects, such as monitoring environmental pollution, the establishment of clear land rights, and sharing of the profits from oil development. By ignoring the wants and needs of the native people, oil companies forced them to turn to political resistance as the only way to make themselves heard. In the 1970s native groups wanted to incorporate concern for damage of the Amazon into the planning and execution of development projects. They also sought local control over development projects as a way to incorporate sustainable practices in their land. These concerns were given little attention until the 1980s when the government began to recognize native land claims. Town-meetings held by the Waorani were run in a consensus style, and although this is a different practice compared to the rest of the world, national governments recognized these meetings as legitimate political proceedings.Sabin, P. (1998). Searching for a middle ground: Native communities and oil extraction in the northern and central Ecuadorian Amazon, 1967-1993. Environmental History, 3(2), 144-168. doi: JSTOR While there is still much that needs to be done in the way of sustainable oil extraction, the discourse between the local population in the Ecuadorian Amazon has increased dramatically giving them a voice and a say in what happens to their land. As their influence rose the Waorani were able to stop exploration in two leased oil blocks in Ecuador. They also pushed the government in 2007 to prohibit oil, gas, and logging activities in the \\"Zona Intangible\\", which was 7,580 km2 of Waorani land. The grounds for this movement included not only contaminations of the Waorani land in the Amazon, but also the diseases, that were decimating the Waorani population, brought in by persons from the developed world. In a lawsuit against Texaco, lawyers pointed to the actual loss of money by oil companies after oil exploitation to prove that sustainable practices on the front end would benefit the company and the land. In the 1980s the average income per barrel of oil was five dollars, while the cost of reparations for the land were more than six dollars per barrel. The six dollars only covered local damages, it did not account for climate change and costs of carbon dioxide production, which also required payment for. These figures prove that indigenous concerns for the land are not only beneficial to the land, but also cost-effective.Temper, L., Y√°nez, I., Sharife, K., Ojo, G., Martinez-Alier, J., CANA, Combes, M., Cornelissen, K., Lerkelund, H., Louw, M., Mart√≠nez, E., Minnaar, J., Molina, P., Murcia, D., Oriola, T., Osuoka, A., P√©rez, M.

EJOLT Report No. 6, 204 p. The story-line about respecting and preserving the land of the \\"last free people\\" is the corner-stone of the ever-changing discourse underlining the Yasun√≠-ITT project, and is used every time human rights activists claim that isolated groups are affected by new oil activities.\\"The riddle of leaving the oil in the soil‚ÄîEcuador's Yasun√≠-ITT project from a discourse perspective\\". Forest Policy and Economics 36: 27-36.  Critical reception and support  Leonardo DiCaprio and Edward Norton as well as Michael Charles Tobias and Jane Gray Morrison are among the many public figures supporting the Ecuadorian government on its historic proposal to conserve biodiversity, protect human rights, and avoid CO2 emissions. The General Secretary of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, also supports the Yasuni-ITT.  Closure =Abandonment of Yasun√≠-ITT Initiative by Ecuadorean government In July 2013, Correa formed a commission to evaluate the Yasuni-ITT Initiative's progress to date. The commission concluded that the economic results were not sufficient. On August 15, Correa scrapped the plan citing poor follow through from the international community. \\"The world has failed us\\", he said, calling the world's richest countries hypocrites who emit most of the world's greenhouse gases while expecting nations like his to sacrifice economic progress for the environment. Through an executive order, he liquidated the Yasuni-ITT trust fund formally ending the initiative. During the six-year history of the initiative, only $336 million had been pledged, Correa said, and of that, only $13.3 million had actually been delivered. On Wednesday September 7, 2016, the Ecuadorian government confirmed the start of drilling activity within the Yasuni-ITT block. Then vice president Jorge Glas led reporters around the drilling site managed by Petroecuador, the country's national oil company. As of July 2016, the whole of the block was estimated to hold around 1.7 billion barrels of oil.  Referendum campaigns  Despite President Correa's decision to close the Yasun√≠-ITT Initiative, environmental groups and conservationists are fighting to keep Yasun√≠-ITT oil-free by forcing a referendum on Correa's plans. This has arisen out of a national law that establishes the possibility of a national referendum taking place on a given subject if a campaign can canvass signatures in favor of such a referendum from 5% of the electorate. In Ecuador, this currently represents just under 600,000 people. In October 2013, shortly after the government approved of Correa's plans and gave the go-ahead to oil exploration in Yasun√≠-ITT, the anti-exploitation group YASunidos launched a campaign to collect enough signatures to trigger a referendum, with the proposed question: \\"Do you agree that the government of Ecuador should leave the crude of ITT, known as Block 43, below ground indefinitely?\\". They were given until early April 2014 to collect the necessary signatures, and as of mid-March they have collected more than 480,000, meaning they are on track to reach their target.http://eyeonlatinamerica.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/yasuni-threat- despite-progress/ Many analysts and commentators suggest that if a referendum were to take place, it may well be successful, as the Yasun√≠-ITT Initiative enjoyed very high levels of support before it was axed in August 2013, with as many as 80% in favor of the initiative and more than 66% opposed to the exploitation of the oil.http://eyeonlatinamerica.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/yasuni-itt- groundbreaking-initiative-hit-the-wall/ However, Correa remains a very popular president and commands a great amount of influence over public opinion, and he has been putting this to good effect in launching a publicity campaign attempting to convince Ecuadoreans of the supposed benefits of extracting the Yasun√≠-ITT oil. These include billions of dollars' worth in revenue which Correa promises will be used to invest in Ecuador's poorest areas, including Amazonian regions such as Yasun√≠. Furthermore, a rival group backing Correa's plans has launched its own campaign to collect the 600,000 signatures necessary to trigger a referendum in favor of the oil's extraction. If both the YASunidos campaign and this second one are successful in collecting enough signatures, forcing a referendum, and achieving a YES vote at the polls, there could follow a scenario of legal confusion over what should happen next.http://eyeonlatinamerica.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/ecuador-yasuni- campaign-progress-threat/ There have also been allegations of \\"foul play\\" by opponents of the YASunidos campaign, including plagiarism of their campaign pamphlets designed to confuse voters and stop YASunidos from collecting enough signatures, and an instance of abduction and assault by government officials against a YASunidos activist.

He was the royal alf√©rez, the king's armour-bearer (armiger regis) and commander of the royal armies, under Vermudo II (r. 984‚Äì999), and he continued to hold the position until his death. He became the tutor (1003) and ultimately father-in-law of Vermudo's successor, King Alfonso V. He maintained peaceful diplomatic relations with the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba until 1004, after which there was a state of war. Regency of Alfonso V Before 999, King Vermudo II placed his heir, Alfonso V, under the tutorship of his alf√©rez Menendo. Alfonso was only five at his father's death (September 999) and he spent the early years of his reign in the care of Menendo and his wife. The earliest act of Alfonso as king dates to 13 October 999, and it lists as confirmants first Count Menendo Gonz√°lez (\\"Menendus Gundisaluiz, comes\\") and then \\"Duke\\" Sancho Garc√≠a of Castile (\\"Santius, dux, Garsea prolis\\"). Menendo, too, appears in contemporary documents with the ducal title, as in \\"Lord Duke Menendo, son of Gonzalo\\" (\\"dux domnus Menendus proles Gundisalvi\\"). Alfonso V in the twelfth-century Libro de los Testamentos (fol. 53v). Until 1003, the young Alfonso always appears in his official acts with his mother, Elvira Garc√≠a, a sister of the count of Castile, beside him. Possibly she was exercising the regency under her brother's influence. In 1000, Menendo witnessed the king's confirmation of the testament of Hilal, called Salvatus, the Mozarabic abbot of San Cipriano de Valdesalce, after the queen-regent Elvira and before five bishops of the realm. A charter dated 23 December 1001 records the settlement of a dispute concerning the monastery of Celanova by Alfonso V and \\"his elder, the lord Menendo, son of Gonzalo\\" (\\"senatus sui domni Ermenagildi Gundisaluiz prolis\\"). Another charter dated 11 January 1002 records the donation of San Andr√©s de Congostro to the monastery of Celanova and was confirmed by Duke Menendo. After 1003, Elvira no longer appears in royal charters; she may have been removed in a palace coup by Menendo. In subscribing one royal act Menendo went so far as to call himself \\"he who under the authority of the aforementioned king ordains and guides all things\\" (\\"qui sub imperio iam dicti regis hec omnia ordinavit et docuit\\"). In 1004, Sancho challenged the regency of Menendo. Both counts petitioned the C√≥rdoban hajib Abd al-Malik to arbitrate the dispute. According to Ibn Khaldun, a hearing took place and Abd al-Malik's deputy, the judge (qadi) of the Mozarabic community of C√≥rdoba, Asbag bin Abd Allah bin Nabil, found in favour of Menendo. According to some sources this took place in C√≥rdoba with the two disputant counts in attendance, but according to others it took place in Le√≥n. A royal charter of 1007 gives the king's recognition to the power of Menendo in Galicia. In it he is called \\"the great count who holds all the land of Galicia\\" (comes magnus ... omnem terram Gallecie ... obtinebat). Relations with C√≥rdoba Menendo did not initially collaborate with C√≥rdoba, but after contingents were sent from C√≥rdoba to reinforce Coimbra and the frontier with Portugal, Menendo entered into a pact with Abd al-Malik. This included a clause calling for military collaboration in 1003. That year Leonese and Castilian troops assisted C√≥rdoba in an attack on Catalonia. This pact seems to have been broken in 1005, when a C√≥rdoban army marched on the Leonese kingdom with the intent of taking Zamora. The city was not captured, but a large territory was seized. For the remainder of Menendo's regency there was no peace with C√≥rdoba. A pyxis once owned by Menendo Gonz√°lez and now in the museum of the cathedral of Braga provides further evidence of his relations with C√≥rdoba. The ivory pyxis with chalice and silver paten,C√°lice de S. Geraldo at the Museum of the Cathedral of Braga. has an inscription on the rim of its lid which allows it to be dated to between 1004, when the hajib Abd al-Malik received the title he bears in the inscription, Sayf al-Dawla (\\"sword of the state\\"), and 1007, when he received the higher title of al- Muzaffar (\\"the victorious\\"). The pyxis was acquired by Menendo before his death, since an inscription to the bottom relates its donation to the church by him and his wife, Toda. The chalice and paten, which are contemporary, appear to be made to fit the pyxis and were possibly commissioned by Menendo. How he obtained the pyxis is unknown. He may have taken it as booty during a campaign against C√≥rdoba, or received it as a gift from the court of C√≥rdoba to the Leonese regent during diplomatic negotiations. The historian Seraf√≠n Moralejo suggests it may have been presented to Menendo by Asbagh the qadi as \\"a good-will gift ... a bitter one indeed and a warning, too, since the title of Sayf al-Dawla carved on its lid commemorated the raid the hajib had launched on Le√≥n one year earlier.\\" The iconography of the pyxis might indicate its function as a diplomatic gift. Violent death The last recorded act of Menendo was to confirm a charter of the monastery of San Pedro de Rocas in 1007. He was mentioned in a lawsuit settled in favour of Count Munio Fern√°ndez in early 1008, but as he did not confirm the result it is probable that he was away from court in Galicia. Eight months later, on 6 October 1008, he died a violent death in unclear circumstances. Ibn Khaldun, dating his death by the anno Hegirae, places it between 17 September 1007 and 4 September 1008, but the date provided by the Chronicon Lusitanum is more reliable. It records that \\"in the year 1046 of the Spanish era, on the day preceding the nones of October, Count Menendo was killed.\\" The wording of both Ibn Khaldun and the Chronicon suggests that Menendo died violently, probably assassinated. Count Munio has been suspected of arranging his assassination in order to usurp the regency. If so, he was foiled by the queen-mother, Elvira Garc√≠a, who proclaimed the fourteen-year-old Alfonso to be of age to assume the responsibilities of government. Around 1013, Alfonso married Elvira Men√©ndez, Gonzalo's daughter. She gave birth to a son, Vermudo III, who succeeded him on the throne, and a daughter, Sancha, who married Count Ferdinand of Castile and passed the Leonese throne on to him. Elvira Men√©ndez died on 2 December 1022. In 1014 Alfonso V confirmed all the possessions of the monastery of Guimar√£es, which had been founded by Menendo's grandmother, Mumadona D√≠az. Viking attack? Olaf Haraldsson. It has been suggested that Menendo was perhaps killed defending Portugal from a Viking raid. According to the later Icelandic saga Heimskringla, the Vikings under Olaf Haraldsson attacked Gunnvaldsborg, possibly to be identified as a descriptive toponym meaning \\"city of Gonz√°lez\\" (in Latin *Gundisalvus-burgus) and indicating Tui, which was within Menendo's dukedom and is independently known to have been destroyed by Vikings about this time. There is a Latin document of 1024 that bears the rubric Tudensis sedes post Normannorum vastationem Ecclesiae Divi Jacobi attributa: \\"the see of Tui was assigned to the church of Santiago after being laid waste by the Northmen\\". In the words of the Heimskringla: > He [Olaf] conquered the castle called Gunnvaldsborg‚Äîit was large and old‚Äîand > there he captured the earl who was in command there, called Geirfith. Then > he had a meeting with the townspeople and imposed a ransom on them for > freeing the earl‚Äîtwelve thousand gold shillings; and that sum was paid by > the townspeople as he had demanded. As says Sigvat: > :A thirteenth time the Thronders' > :thane did win a battle > :south in Seljupollarin > :sithen, with great carnage, > :when to ancient stronghold > :early at morn he marched, and > :gallant Earl Geirfith of > :Gunnvaldsborg made captive. All the details of this theory‚ÄîMenendo's death in battle, the identity of Gunnvaldsborg and the timing and place of Olaf's raid‚Äîare speculative and have been recently dismissed as unfounded. Family relations Menendo Gonz√°lez was probably the eldest son and successor of Gonzalo Men√©ndez and his wife Ilduara Pel√°ez. Menendo's wife is variously known in contemporary sources as Toda, Tota, Todadomna, Tutadomna, Tutadonna, etc. One twelfth-century source calls her Mayor. Menendo had at least six sons and three daughters: *Rodrigo Men√©ndez, a direct ancestor in the maternal line of Urraca Fr√≥ilaz, wife of Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba *Gonzalo Men√©ndez (attested 983‚Äì1008), is cited with the title of count during his father's lifetime *Pelayo Men√©ndez, served as armiger regis in 1012‚Äì14 *Ramiro Men√©ndez (attested 1005‚Äì15), served as armiger regis in 1015 *Egas Men√©ndez (attested 1007‚Äì14) *Munio Men√©ndez (attested 1007‚Äì14) *Elvira Men√©ndez, queen of Alfonso V *Ilduara Men√©ndez (attested 1025‚Äì58), married Nu√±o Al√≥itiz, a count in Portugal *Ildoncia (Eldonza) Men√©ndez (attested 1014)  Notes  References  Bibliography= Secondary sources  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Primary sources  * * * * Category:1008 deaths Category:Counts of Portugal Category:County of Portugal Category:10th-century rulers of Portugal Category:11th-century rulers of Portugal Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Menendo Gonz√°lez"},{"id":"26949764","text":"Chancellor and Patrick was a Melbourne based architecture firm, formed in 1953 and dissolved in 1981, is best known for their numerous houses from the mid 1950s to the mid 1960s, designed in their signature dynamic, expressive take on 'organic' architecture.

David Chancellor (born 7 September 1926) studied civil engineering from 1943 to 1945 at the Melbourne Technical College, served two years in the Navy, then went on to the School of Architecture at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1951. The two met at the firm Yuncken Freeman Brothers in late 1951, where they formed a close working relationship, submitting several competitions together. Chancellor set up his own firm in the distant beachside suburb of Frankston in 1952, and Patrick joined him formally in the middle of 1954, establishing the practice of Chancellor and Patrick. In 1958, they established a second office in South Yarra, continued to prosper, and built up a practice that eventually employed 30 staff. Chancellor and Patrick began with a variety of expressive houses, mostly holiday homes, on the Mornington Peninsula, where the firm began. They soon developed their own distinctive style; an amalgam of features of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie and Usonian houses, the houses of Californian architect Harwell Hamilton Harris, and their own innovations. They featured dynamic plans, emphasised by projecting intersecting wings or bays with expressed, overhanging gable or flat roofs, dramatic cantilevers, strong horizontals with occasional verticals, off-centre supports, expressed structure, butt-jointed corner windows, and integration with the landscape. Many can be found on the Peninsula, as well as many dotted around the 1950s and 60s suburbs and area of Melbourne, especially the Bayside suburbs. They are said to have designed (if not built) over 1000 houses in their career. Their houses of the late 1960s onwards were often larger, and evolved into brown brick, skillion roofed compositions, more ground hugging, and more in tune with the 'environmental' designs of their contemporaries. Throughout their career, they also designed many non-residential projects, including a number of churches, pre-school buildings and a hospital, as well as banks and other commercial work. Their largest projects were the all the halls of residence at Monash University, and Chisholm College at La Trobe University.

ES&A; Bank Building The former ES&A; Bank Building was built on the corner of Elizabeth and Franklin Street, Melbourne, in 1959‚Äì60 by Melbourne architects Chancellor and Patrick.Royal Australian Institute of Architects RSTA Register08 ‚Äì www.architecture.com.au/i-cms_file?page=4048/VicRegister08.pdf Originally intended to be a 12-storey office tower, only the base banking chamber section was built at the time. The most distinctive features of the building are the massive rock-faced random coursed Dromana granite pier/wall sections, dominating the side elevation, topped by a thin floating slab roof projecting over the recessed front elevation. The space between the stone piers on the Franklin Street elevation is filled with a patterned, vertical ribbed concrete screen. The building is considered to display influences from International modernism, and the organic sensibilities of Frank Lloyd Wright as well as the Griffins.Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Architecture Volume 1 A-F, R. Stephen Sennott p163 The extra floors were added in 2004, but as an apartment building with regular glass balconies, rather than the originally proposed solid masonry balconies projecting every second floor, and various changes to the original base section have infilled openings in the front facade, and undermined the floating qualities of the original roof. Freiberg House The Freiberg House was built in 1958‚Äì60 on a sloping site as a residence for the Freiberg family and is located at 26 Yarravale Road Kew, Victoria. Featured on the cover of Best Australian Houses (1961), edited by Neil Clerehan, the Freiberg house is a significant example of the work of Chancellor and Patrick. It features most of the hallmarks of their subsequent 1960s houses, such as projecting wings on a cruciform or pin-wheel plan, each with gable roofs, dramatic projecting cantilevered ends, overhanging eaves, expressed post-and-beam construction, off-center spaces under otherwise centered roofs, and a central solid spine, containing the entry and main stairs. It is also notable for having the first entirely native garden planned by Edna Walling, with whom Chancellor and Patrick was a long-time collaborator.

The first consulate of the Soviet Union in San Francisco opened in 1933. During the World War II U.S.-Soviet Alliance Jacob M. Lomakin was Consul General (1942-1944). He was active in the Lend-Lease program and at meetings for raising funds to aid the Red Army.https://sites.google.com/site/russianwarrelief These meetings were funded by numerous anti-fascist organizations, among them the International Committee of the Red Cross, American-Russian Institute and Russian War Relief. Together with progressive cultural figures, military and governmental officials of the United States, Lomakin advocated the opening of the Second Front.Christopher Hampton ‚ÄúTales of Hollywood‚ÄùVictor Arnautoff and the Politics of Art, Robert W.

The graves were installed on Mare Island in Vallejo, California. The city government protested the plan, saying that it goes against historical preservation.Jones, Carolyn. \\"Vallejo fights Russian Consulate over headstones\\" (). San Francisco Chronicle.

In December 2016, four Russian diplomats posted to the consulate, including a chef were declared persona non grata due to alleged espionage, in retaliation for Russian interference in the United States presidential election. On 31 August 2017, the State Department ordered the post closed by September 2, 2017.Achieving Parity in Diplomatic Missions U.S. Department of State, August 31, 2017. Before the consulate was closed, smoke was seen billowing out of the building, suggesting sensitive materials were being destroyed. Espionage Members of the United States intelligence community, including Kathleen Puckett, considered the Russian consulate a major hub of Russian espionage operations, tasked with gaining information about developments from Silicon Valley. In 1984, a United States government report indicated that there may have been approximately 50 Soviet spies operating out of the San Francisco Consulate, primarily targeting Silicon Valley. In 1987, Ivan N. Miroshkin of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reported that the consulate had been bugged. Russian diplomats based out of the consulate were reportedly mapping where underground nodes connected to the national fiber-optic communication network. A network of antenna and other electronic communication equipment is located on the roof of the consulate building, and is allegedly used to transmit information to submarines or trawlers located off the Pacific coast in international waters.

It is one of the largest homeless shelters in the city that offers services to people of all genders. The Shepherds of Good Hope welcomes people of all faiths and beliefs, and provides three main services: Support Services, Supportive Living and Shelter Services. Shepherds of Good Hope also operates a soup kitchen, and serves approximately 800 sandwiches and 600 whole meals daily to the people of Ottawa who need it most. History Established in 1983, the Shepherds of Good Hope started as an emergency men's and women's shelter and grocery program out of St Brigid's in Lower Town. In 1984, a men's shelter and clothing program opened in the Guigues School, and finally, on October 1, 1985, the soup kitchen, shelter and the Clothing & Grocery programs all moved to their current location, on 233 Murray St, also in Lower Town. The building had once been host to the St-Brigid's School. The first Christmas Hamper program was established a year later, in November 1986, and still continues today providing vital food to over 1000 families for Christmas. In 1988, three new programs were created ‚Äì Hope Outreach, Hope Community, and the Hope Centre. All three are targeted at providing housing, whether emergency or long term, for the clients of the Shepherds of Good Hope. In 1990, the Hope School, Hope Recovery, House of Lambs and Hope Discovery Supportive Housing were added to the resources available from the Shepherds of Good Hope (more on each below). However, two years later several programs were cut due to reorganization, including Hope School and House of Lambs. In December 1998, Sophie's hope was started as an effort to create an environment where women could feel safe and would always be accepted. Though not directly affiliated with the Shepherds of Good Hope, Sophie's Hope set up shop inside 233 Murray St. In 1999, the Hope Community and Hope Discovery joined together to create a ‚ÄúSupportive Housing‚Äù system of care, which is today one of the three main services offered through the Shepherds of Good Hope. Thirty two extra housing units were opened later in the year to accommodate people suffering from severe mental illnesses, and eighteen housing units for people who require minimal care. In May 2000, the Managed Alcohol Program was introduced, to much controversy, as the experimental program provided participants with controlled amounts of alcohol instead of promoting complete abstinence. In 2002 funding allowed the Shepherds of Good Hope to provide a housing worker for the ‚ÄúSupportive Housing‚Äù program in an attempt to help people to find and maintain housing. In 2003, the Shepherds of Good Hope celebrated its 20th anniversary, and opened up 10 new beds for the Managed Alcohol Program. In May 2004, the shelter purchased a building on St-Andrews with the Ministry of Health Funding which became a part of Supportive Living, allowing for 35 housing units to be built for clients who are diagnosed with a mental disorder, but independent enough to live on their own. A year later, Hope Community closed its doors. More recently, in 2009, after several years of searching for a place to relocate the Supportive Housing, the Shepherds of Good Hope purchased an old hotel to move its residents that could be living in Supportive Housing but are still in the shelters, in an effort to remove people from the drugs so readily available in Lower-town Ottawa.

These crucial members manage areas such as treasury, fundraising, accounting and church affiliation. The directors, the board and all other employees and volunteers work together to coordinate the management and maintenance of the Shepherds of Good Hope. Volunteers In addition to the board of management is the Team of Volunteers who critical to the success of the Shepherds of Good Hope. In 2018, 58,000 hours of work were contributed by over 450 volunteers for the Shepherds of Good Hope. Each individual is asked to provide one 4 hour shift per week for 6 months. Additionally, clients of the Shepherds of Good Hope put in over 7000 hours of volunteering around the shelter. This client-based service encourages clients to develop skills that could lead to future job skills. Volunteer tasks are performed around the premises and include working in the Clothing Room, Drop-In Centre, Soup Kitchen, shelters and residences, and Women Stabilization Program as well as helping to put together Christmas Hampers. Clients of the Shepherds of Good Hope are also encouraged to help out in the Soup Kitchen and shelter. Certain volunteers offer their services in their specialization to the Shepherds.

In 2008, 21,000 families in Ottawa benefited from the Grocery Program, for a total of approximately $440, 000 worth of groceries. The food provided in the baskets are reflective of community donations as well as seasonal availability for fruits and vegetables. =The Clothing Program= The Clothing Program provides clothing and footwear to the guests of the Shepherds of Good Hope as well as to low-income individuals. =The Evening Drop-In= The Evening Drop-In program provides a safe environment for anyone from 5:30- 9:30 pm. Soup and hot drinks are provided, and guests can participate in card games, bingo, tutorials, AA meetings, or simply enjoy the flat screen T.V. Or live musical entertainment. Shelter Program The Shepherds of Good Hope have several shelter programs, to maximize the help they can provide to people from all different walks of life. =Emergency Men's Shelter= The Emergency Men's Shelter is a 24-hour shelter equipped with 102 beds and provides food, showers, laundry services and medicine storage for its residents. =Emergency Women's Shelter= The Emergency Women's Shelter is a 24-hour emergency shelter for women or transgender individuals who are over the age of 18. It is equipped with 57 beds and provides 3 meals a day, shower, laundry and hygiene supplies, safer injection supplies and clean clothing. Additionally, Hope Outreach has on-site psychiatric nurses, medical help, and addiction assessment and support. Hope Outreach also hosts a pilot project targeting homeless people who are unable to access services for their severe health problems due to their lifestyle. This project is an Inner City Pilot Project, and has been hugely successful. Implemented in 2001, it was running at ‚Äú100% capacity within 6 weeks of opening‚Äù, and grew in number between 2001 and 2003. This project is also being hosted in other shelters in the Ottawa community. =Hope Recovery= Hope Recovery provides 21 beds, food, access to hygiene, laundry and medicine storage for women and men under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Hope Recovery accepts clients from other shelters, Police Services, Ottawa Detox and hospitals. Furthermore, clients residing at Hope Recovery are encouraged to seek help for their addictions. =Managed Alcohol Program= The Managed Alcohol Program is partnered with the Inner City Health Project. The idea of MAP is to reduce harm to the individual. By allowing for participants in the project to have 5 oz. of home brewed wine or 3 oz. of sherry every hour, the MAP believed that drinking in moderation would reduce binge drinking and the consumption of dangerous substances, such as mouthwash and paint thinners.Cosh, Colby \\"A Most Improbable Cure\\" Report / Newsmagazine (Alberta Edition), August 10, 2001, Vol. 28 Issue 19, p48 This program targets individuals who have failed other substance abuse treatment programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous, who promote total abstinence from drinking. Questionnaires were handed out to the MAP participants as well, to record and properly study their past alcohol use, daily activities and health. The program began with 12 subjects, but has increased to 22. Studies conducted at the University of Ottawa after an average of 16 months participation from subjects showed that the number of emergency department visits, police altercations and alcohol consumption all lowered for participants of the MAP. It was reported that overall hygiene and compliance with medical care also increased. Additionally, the average of drinks per day for a single subject dropped from 46 to 8. Supportive Housing The Shepherds of Good Hope run 4 Supportive Living housing units, targeted at helping clients become more independent, while still tending to their needs for support and supervision. =Hope Living Residence= Hope Living is a 35 unit residence for people diagnosed with severe mental disabilities. It is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Hope living is made possible through the help of the following partnering agencies: Royal Ottawa Health Care Group, the Sandy Hill Community Centre, the John Howard Society, C.M.H.A., and A.C.T.T.. Clients of the Hope Living residence are encouraged to develop life skills in order to reintegrate into the community. =St. Andrew's Residence= This 35 unit housing centre contains both single and double occupancy units for clients diagnosed with a mental illness but who are independent enough to have a more independent lifestyle. Staff is only employed on as-needed basis, and only interested residents partake in skill training. This centre boasts a true sense of community and has many active clubs for the residents. =Hope Living= Sophie's Hope is a women's shelter established by Francine Pelletier. Pelletier started this shelter as a homage to a woman she had been working with in the past, who was an IV drug user that had developed AIDS and was also pregnant. Pelletier came up with the idea of this shelter when she noticed that several establishments would not allow Sophie on their premises because of her active drug use. There was a need for a safe place where women could be allowed access regardless of their condition. Sophie's Hope is not an overnight shelter, but is open from 4 pm to midnight and provides a place for women to eat, enjoy entertainment, play a game of cards, or just enjoy conversation with fellow women. Many women benefit from this program, as the opening hours keep them off the streets and away from drugs and prostitution. Although the Shepherds of Good Hope are not exclusively affiliated with Sophie's Hope, they allowed for the women's shelter to open in the main Shepherds of Good Hope building, at 233 Murray St., in 1998. Sophie's Hope has been at its own independent location since 2000. =The Oaks= In 2009, the Shepherds of Good Hope purchased 2 buildings in the Carlington area of Ottawa, which they have turned into housing for their clients who qualify for Supportive Housing but are still living in the downtown shelters. Formerly the Cardinal Suites Motel, the new wellness centre has been named The Oaks, and strives to help its new residents with living in their own apartments, as well as promote wellness. Controversy has surrounded this project since news broke that 55 homeless people would be moving to Carlington. 250 people presented themselves to a Carlington meeting to protest the move, as they feared that the already existing prostitution problem would be made worse by what the homeless people could be bringing to the neighbourhood ‚Äì crime, drugs and alcohol. Despite this controversy, 55 people have moved into The Oaks, which has 24-hour staffing and surveillance, is a gated facility to control access to the grounds and minimize trouble that could occur.

Founded in 1998 and based in Jacksonville, Florida, the corps was the only World Class corps in the state of Florida until going inactive in 2012. History The corps considers its origin to be the year 1983, when three Jacksonville area high school students attempted to found a community drum and bugle corps. Approximately 200 youth showed up to a city park, and a couple of rehearsals took place. However, the three students realized they did not have the money or experience to run the corps. In 1998, two of the original students, Michael Butler and Danny Clark, attempted to start a corps in Jacksonville. This time, they were successful in securing financial support and sponsorships. They used donated uniforms and bugles and were allowed to perform during halftime for the Jacksonville Jaguars during the 1999 season. Although they did not expect to tour in 1999, the response to the new organization led the administration to have the corps take a two-week tour eventually into Madison, Wisconsin, and the corps finished the season 9th out of 12 corps in Division II. In the 2000 season, the corps shrunk itself and began competing in Division III, in order to ensure its longevity. The corps eventually climbed the Division III ranks, winning the Division III percussion world championship and finishing in 3rd place in 2004. In 2005, the corps moved up to Division II again and finished 4th in Division II/III finals. The corps won the Spirit of Disney award in 2007 while taking home 3rd place, and also placed 5th in the new Open Class in 2008. In 2009, the corps switched its uniforms from the old black and teal to a cream uniform with teal and gold. The corps finished 4th in Open Class that year. Before the 2010 season, Teal Sound was granted World Class membership, and as such became the first drum corps from Florida in Drum Corps International's top division since the Florida Wave, Magic of Orlando, and Suncoast Sound. That year, the corps finished 20th out of the 23 World Class corps, and in 2011 the corps finished 19th in World Class. Their 2012 show was entitled: \\"CircO: A Circus For A Modern World\\", and featured compositions by Robert W. Smith, among other composers. Unfortunately, their 2012 season ended early, ending on July 9th after a show in Centerville, Ohio. The corps experienced many financial woes in the beginning of the season, most notably a fallout with their bus company. On July 9th, Teal Sound posted on their Facebook Page that the corps would end their season early and start back to Florida the following day. The organization did not field a corps in the 2013 season. The corps no longer has an active Facebook page, or website. There has been no official announcement for if they would be fielding a corps in the future.

Career  After directing the short film Margotita (1984) Polaco made his feature film debut with Diapas√≥n (1986), a modern retelling of the Pygmalion myth. It was followed by En el nombre del hijo (1987), a film about a disturbed doll restorer and his possessive mother, for which he won a Golden Dolphin at the Festr√≥ia - Tr√≥ia International Film Festival in Setubal, Portugal, in 1988.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0688783/awards All of his early films star fetish actress Margot Moreyra as the character Margotita. In 1989 Polaco made his most famous and controversial film, Kindergarten, starring Graciela Borges, Arturo Puig and Luisa Vehil. The film sparked controversy due to its alleged mistreatment of child actors (the protagonist, an eleven-year-old, spends most of his screen-time naked), as well as a number of censored scenes: an adult woman and a child take a bath together, the same woman later on makes suggestive advances on the child, plus the inclusion of an unrelated, explicit oral sex scene. The movie was banned from theaters by the Justice one day short of release and a prolonged trial ensued over eight years, emotionally devastating Polaco and his fellow workers. The film remains unreleased in Argentina. It has gained notoriety as being the first film to be censored following the end of the military dictatorship in 1983. Polaco remained active nonetheless, filming Siempre es dif√≠cil volver a casa (1992), his first major studio production, and La dama regresa (1996), which served as a comeback vehicle for retired actress Isabel Sarli. Polaco retreated from directing for a period of time. 2001 saw his comeback, making the short film El milagro with famed ballet dancer Julio Bocca, contributing to the anthology film Historias de Argentina en vivo (amongst Adri√°n Caetano, Marcelo Pi√±eyro, Bruno Stagnaro and Vicentico) and directing another feature-length movie, Viaje por el cuerpo, for which he was nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Art Direction at the Argentinean Film Critics Association Awards, and won a Golden Apple at the New York LaCinemaFe.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0688783/awards After some time working on it, Polaco gave up on the project of a modern adaptation of Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha. In 2007 he made the short film A Berta Singerman. In 2009 he teamed once more with Isabel Sarli and made the feature film Arroz con leche. Polaco's Kindergarten was eventually released on the 2011 Mar del Plata Film Festival for the first time since its shooting over 20 years before. He died on 20 February 2014 at the age of 67, from Parkinson's disease complications.Muri√≥ el cineasta Jorge Polaco  Filmography  *1984 - Margotita *1986 - Diapas√≥n (Tuning Fork) *1987 - En el nombre del hijo (In the Name of the Son) *1989 - Kindergarten *1992 - Siempre es dif√≠cil volver a casa (It's Always Hard to Return Home) *1996 - La dama regresa (The Lady Returns) *2001 - El milagro (The Miracle) *2001 - Viaje por el cuerpo (Journey Across the Body) *2001 - Historias de Argentina en vivo (Live Stories from Argentina) *2007 - A Berta Singerman (For Berta Singerman) *2009 - Arroz con leche (Rice and Milk)  References  External links  * Category:1946 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Argentine film directors Category:Argentine screenwriters Category:Male screenwriters Category:Argentine male writers Category:Burials at La Chacarita Cemetery ","title":"Jorge Polaco"},{"id":"26950159","text":"Emanuele Gerada KC*HS (18 May 1920 ‚Äì 21 January 2011) was a Maltese prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, a Vatican diplomat and titular Archbishop of Nomentum. One Maltese obituary recalled him as \\"a generous, well-read and intelligent man.\\" Biography Gerada was born in Malta and ordained a priest on 1 August 1943 for the Archdiocese of Malta. He studied in Rome for a doctorate in canon law and joined the Vatican's diplomatic service, in which he served for most of his career. He was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Malta (then to Coadjutor Archbishop in 1968) and titular Bishop of Nomentum on 15 February 1967 and was consecrated on 18 June 1967. A former priest-secretary recalled at the time of his death that one of Gerada's achievements was an improvement in the relations between the Maltese Church and the Labour Party. Such had been the deterioration in the relationship that Catholic Labour supporters were denied burial in the consecrated section of cemeteries and voting Labour was declared a mortal sin. But Gerada negotiated an agreement acceptable to both sides. Gerada resumed his diplomatic career with the Holy See when he was appointed apostolic nuncio to El Salvador and Guatemala on 8 November 1973. In this post he was said to lobby for the appointment of Archbishop Oscar Romero but Gerada later objected when Romero cancelled many Sunday masses after the state-sponsored murder of Jesuit priest Fr Rutilio Grande in 1977. On 15 October 1980 he was appointed apostolic pro- nuncio to Pakistan and served until his appointment as Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland on 4 February 1989. His arrival in Ireland was greeted warmly coming after the rather austere and conservative Archbishop Gaetano Alibrandi. Gerada played a key role when the Vatican attempted to silence Bishop Brendan Comiskey because of his views on priestly celibacy. Later reports said a priest with suspicions about the deviant behaviour of Fr Brendan Smyth wrote to Archbishop Gerada. Gerada retired on 17 October 1995 and died on 21 January 2011.

History In the 19th century, Will of the People carried out a campaign of assassinations against high-ranking Russian leaders. In India, militants launched an assassination campaign against AD (L) and AD (B) members. In northern Ireland, an assassination campaign was directed against representatives of the British Army, the RUC, the Ulster Defence Regiment, and their respective reserves.Foley, Thomas P., Public Security and Individual Freedom: The Dilemma of Northern Ireland, 8 Yale J. World Pub. Ord. 284 (1981‚Äì1982) Operation Wrath of God was an assassination campaign. According to The Washington Post, among Syria's \\"most notable activities of the past few years have been the serial assassination of senior Lebanese politicians, including former prime minister Rafik Hariri\\". According to The New York Times, in 2007, Sunni Arab extremists began a systematic campaign to assassinate police chiefs, police officers, other Interior Ministry officials and tribal leaders throughout Iraq, staging at least 10 attacks in 48 hours. Assassination campaigns also occurred in the North Caucasus.http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx;_ttnews[tt_news]=3454 Assassination campaigns have taken place as well in Iran. Operation Condor was another assassination campaign. The Taliban has also been waging an assassination campaign against members of the Afghan central government. In 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush signed an intelligence finding that could have opened the door to an American targeted killing campaign. In The Impact of 9/11 and the New Legal Landscape: The Day That Changed Everything?, the point is made that \\"There is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing.... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination. Assassination ... constitutes an illegal killing.\\" Similarly, Amos Guiora, Professor of law at the University of Utah, writes: \\"Targeted killing is ... not an assassination\\", Steve David, Johns Hopkins Associate Dean & Professor of International Relations, writes: \\"there are strong reasons to believe that the Israeli policy of targeted killing is not the same as assassination\\", Syracuse Law Professor William Banks and GW Law Professor Peter Raven-Hansen write: \\"Targeted killing of terrorists is ... not unlawful and would not constitute assassination\\", Rory Miller writes: \\"Targeted killing ... is not 'assassination'\\", and Associate Professor Eric Patterson and Teresa Casale write: \\"Perhaps most important is the legal distinction between targeted killing and assassination\\".\\"Targeted Killing and Assassination: The U.S. Legal Framework\\", Banks, William C., Raven-Hansen, Peter, 37 U.

The exact position, curvature, etc. are in this case not essential; the sequence of windings around the two special points is. In mathematics, the Pochhammer contour, introduced by Jordan (1887), pp. 243‚Äì244 and , is a contour in the complex plane with two points removed, used for contour integration. If A and B are loops around the two points, both starting at some fixed point P, then the Pochhammer contour is the commutator ABA‚àí1B‚àí1, where the superscript ‚àí1 denotes a path taken in the opposite direction. With the two points taken as 0 and 1, the fixed basepoint P being on the real axis between them, an example is the path that starts at P, encircles the point 1 in the counter-clockwise direction and returns to P, then encircles 0 counter-clockwise and returns to P, after that circling 1 and then 0 clockwise, before coming back to P. The class of the contour is an actual commutator when it is considered in the fundamental group with basepoint P of the complement in the complex plane (or Riemann sphere) of the two points looped. When it comes to taking contour integrals, moving basepoint from P to another choice Q makes no difference to the result, since there will be cancellation of integrals from P to Q and back.  Homologous to zero but not homotopic to zero  Within the doubly punctured plane this curve is homologous to zero but not homotopic to zero. Its winding number about any point is 0 despite the fact that within the doubly punctured plane it cannot be shrunk to a single point. Pochhammer cycle is homologous to zero: it is the boundary of the green area minus the boundary of the red one. Applications The beta function is given by Euler's integral :\\\\displaystyle \\\\Beta(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)=\\\\int_0^1 t^{\\\\alpha-1}(1-t)^{\\\\beta-1} \\\\, dt provided that the real parts of Œ± and Œ≤ are positive, which may be converted into an integral over the Pochhammer contour C as :\\\\displaystyle (1-e^{2\\\\pi i\\\\alpha})(1-e^{2\\\\pi i\\\\beta})\\\\Beta(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta) =\\\\int_C t^{\\\\alpha-1}(1-t)^{\\\\beta-1} \\\\, dt. The contour integral converges for all values of Œ± and Œ≤ and so gives the analytic continuation of the beta function. A similar method can be applied to Euler's integral for the hypergeometric function to give its analytic continuation.  Puzzle  A popular puzzle asks how one can hang a picture on a wall by looping a string over two nails in such a way that if either one of the nails is removed, the picture falls. The Pochhammer contour is one answer. The picture may be attached at any point on the curve.  Borromean link  A Borromean link. The Pochhammer curve together with two suitably located additional simple closed curves makes a Borromean link, i.e. the three curves are linked, but if any one of the three ceases to exist then the other two are not linked.

Early career Born at Hamua, north of Eketahuna, in 1894, Hopkirk started his scientific career as a cadet in the laboratory of the Biology Department of Victoria University College and in 1912 became a laboratory assistant at the Wallaceville Animal Diagnostic and Research Laboratory. During World War I, Hopkirk served with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade in Palestine, reaching the rank of corporal. When he returned from the war, he moved to Australia and attended Melbourne Veterinary School, graduating with a BVSc with first class honours in 1923. He was later awarded the degree of DVSc by the University of Melbourne for his work on bovine mastitis and other animal diseases. From 1924 to 1945, Hopkirk served in the New Zealand Territorial Force, as an officer in the New Zealand Veterinary Corps. During World War II he was the assistant director of veterinary services for the Central Military District. In 1945 he was transferred to the Reserve of Officers, retiring in 1950. He rose to the rank of major. Hopkirk became director of the Wallaceville Animal Research Centre in 1923 and would remain in this role until 1945. The bacteriologist Sydney Josland worked under the direction of Hopkirk at the Centre during this period. Later career Upon his resignation from the Centre in 1945, Hopkirk worked internationally as a senior veterinarian in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. He was a leader of an FAO mission in Ethiopia and later served as veterinary officer for the New Zealand High Commission in London. On his return to New Zealand, from 1959 until 1961, Hopkirk held a temporary lectureship at Lincoln College. Hopkirk was president of the New Zealand Veterinary Association on three occasions and was honorary secretary for 12 years and a councillor. He was a foundation member of the New Zealand Society of Animal Production and in 1967 was elected Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Agricultural Science. In 1972, Hopkirk was elected an honorary member of the New Zealand Microbiological Society. In the 1966 New Year Honours, Hopkirk was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services in the field of veterinary science. He died at Havelock North in 1987.

The crisis began in the early 1980s and intensified after the Israeli economic stabilization program of 1985 during which the inflation stopped, and was characterized by the accumulating of large debts from the kibbutzim and in low return. The economic crisis in many of the kibbutzim was also accompanied by a social crisis and a demographic crisis. In 1989 and 1996 the Israeli government, the Israeli banks and the kibbutz movements agreed upon two debt arrangements to help resolve the economic crisis. The demographic crisis and the social crises were the major catalyst for the change processes many of the kibbutzim have experienced since the 1990s. Alongside the many kibbutzim who ended up experiencing an economic crisis, is a small group of kibbutzim the crisis skipped. These kibbutzim remained mostly loyal to the traditional values and way of life of the kibbutz and many of them have assisted tremendously in repaying the debt of the economically weak kibbutzim.  The historical background of the crisis  The kibbutz crisis during the 1980s was not the first financial crisis of the kibbutzim. It was preceded by many crises, which were followed by many debt settlements as well. The first debt settlement took place in 1924 and since then, debt settlements have been carried out about once every decade and a half.Daniel Gavron, The Kibbutz: Awakening from Utopia. In the 1950s, following a deep crisis in the kibbutz movement, a new department was established in the Ministry of Agriculture whose main purpose was to make a recovery program in the kibbutzim. This department developed in 1958 a concentrated credit plan, according to which each kibbutz was assigned to one of three banks. The three banks were Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi and the Agriculture Bank. As part of this settlement many of the debts of each kibbutz were deleted, while the other part of the debt was re-distributed, and these banks were responsible for giving the kibbutzim the credit for their development. During all those years, a recognition formed among the Israeli governments, the banks and the kibbutz movement, that the Israeli governments are supposed to guarantee the kibbutzim's debt, and that they would keep on making the payments for the kibbutzim's debt in one way or another. This realization crystallized during the period when the Israeli government completely controlled the capital market, and allocated credit to selected favored destinations - according to its own priorities. The role of banks in the system was technical: they were used as a mean for the government to transfer credit, without actually carrying out financial risk management as needed in a free market system. In addition to receiving credit from the banks, the kibbutzim also received additional credit from kibbutz movement funds and from regional and national shopping organizations. As part of this credit guarantees were made according to which each kibbutz had a guarantee to the debts of the kibbutz movement funds, and through this mechanism to all the kibbutzim's debt. These credit guarantees gave the financial systems in the kibbutzim and in the banks the false feeling that they would be capable of overcoming any financial crisis in the future.  The economical background of the crisis  During the discussion that evolved following the kibbutz crises, different explanations for the crises were raised. The banks, naturally, and a large part of the Israeli society saw the conduct of the kibbutzim as main reason for the crisis, while the kibbutzim tended, naturally, to impose a large part of the responsibility to the crisis on banks and the Israeli government. The main arguments raised against the kibbutzim addressed the following points: * Investments made without economic justification: due to the ease of credit gain, the kibbutzim invested large sums of money in industry and agriculture, often when the investment did not have an economic justification, and often without sufficient examination of the investment in terms of financial risk management. * Inefficiency in the allocation of personnel and capital: it was argued that the investments made in industry and agriculture were not done effectively due to the desire to reduce the use of wage workers (for ideological reasons), or due to lack of willingness of different kibbutz members to work in certain positions or in certain shifts. * Taking non-linked loans: due to the high inflation, which reached more than 400 percent a year, the financial instrument used for raising capital was non- linked loans, which often carried a positive yield. When the inflation stopped, the interest of these loans became devastating. The kibbutz, as any other financial businesses, were not capable of making profits in this rate (which as mentioned reached more than 400%), and this led to the increase of the debt due to the loans. * Making speculative investments in the stock market: unlike the kibbutz ideology, which put an emphasis on productive work and condemned making speculative profits, the kibbutzim participated, especially through the kibbutz movement funds, in the trading of stocks in the stock market, and incurred heavy losses during the bank shares collapse in 1983. Recent studies made by anthropologists in the kibbutzim, indicate how social factors led to these errors. The main social factor was the lack of leadership that resulted from the rotation norm that the leaders of the kibbutz movements encouraged to ensure their control in kibbutzim: conservative kibbutzim managers incapable of thinking critically and loyal to the kibbutz movement were promoted at the end of a short term, while managers who were critical thinkers and innovators were often not promoted or as a result left their kibbutz. Claims directed towards the banks included: * Reliance on the government to cover the kibbutzim debt: despite knowing that the credit given to the kibbutzim were nor enough securities, the banks continued to provide credit, based on the assumption that when it would be needed, the government would make sure that the debt would be covered. * Depriving debt calculation: the banks calculated the debt estimation not according to the law, which increased to huge proportions from the mid-1980s. This was done by making calculations that deprived the debt owners. According to the kibbutzim, the use of these methods with a high real interest percentage caused a significant increase of the debt. It was argued that the inflation halting plan the government implemented in July 1985 was too drastic, leading to a real interest of hundreds of percent, this situation especially affected the agricultural sector, which has a credit need due to the agriculture \\"production process\\" that lasts many months. In addition, many of the investments in agriculture yield profit only years later, for example plantations, cultivating cattle and sheep, as well as export-oriented industry encouraged by the government also required substantial credit.  The development of the crisis during the 1980s  In May 1977, the Likud party came to power, the first time in thirty years of Labor rule. The new prime minister Menachem Begin appointed Simha Erlich as the finance minister. Erlich introduced an economic reform, aimed to change the character of the Israeli economy and transforming its socialist ideology characteristics to a more capitalist characteristics. Following the economic measures taken, which were not accompanied by reduced government budgets, the inflation jumped from 34 percent in 1977 to 131 percent in 1980. Despite a later exchange of Ministers in the Ministry of Finance and despite economic programs were held designed to stop the inflation, the vital step of reducing government budgets was not carried out, and as a result the inflation continued to rise until it came to its peak in 1984 at about 374 percent. These years were years of glory for financial experts of the moment, who managed to balance raging inflation and the gradually strengthening dollar against the pound and the Shekel, and managed to produce profits from the volatility and the uncertainty in the capital markets. Although the Kibbutzim, which were identified with the Israeli Labor Party, lost their political gain and their ability to dramatically influence the decision-making political centers, when the Likud party came to power, many of them continued to act the same as they did during the rule of the Israeli Labor party, being confident that the government would provide them with a safety net if necessary, as it did in the past.  The debt settlements with the kibbutzim  The first debt settlements with the kibbutzim were preceded by attempts to establish plans to solve the different financial problems. At first it was plans were initiated by the kibbutz movement, and later on they were conducted in conjunction with the Israeli banks. All these plans failed eventually. At the end of 1989, after a year of discussions, the kibbutz movements, Israeli banks and the Ministry of Finance a settlement was achieved. The main principles of the settlement were: * The banks would delete the kibbutz debts of 2 billion NIS (at 1993 values). * An additional debt of 1.3 billion NIS would be deleted with government funding. * Raising of 1.7 billion NIS for repayment for the whole kibbutz debt to the banking system. * Long-term redeployment of 6.7 billion NIS of the debt, with an interest rate of 4.5% per year. * Cancellation of mutual Co-signing between the kibbutzim. * A reimbursement assessment was determined for each kibbutz based on each Kibbutz means of production. * Establishment of a governing body to monitor implementation of the settlement--defined as a trustee of all the three parties in the settlement. In practice, not all of the debt deletions, which were originally included in the settlement, were actually carried out. The debt interest also turned out to be much higher than stipulated in the settlement, and as a result, many of the kibbutzim failed to pay the debts and their debt only kept on growing. At the beginning of the 1990s new discussions began on an additional settlement. Ultimately it was decided that \\"the complementary settlement\\" will begin in 1994, but the agreement itself was signed only by 1996 . The main principles of the complementary settlement were: * The Kibbutzim were divided into two groups ‚ÄúReal estate Kibbutzim‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeripheral Kibbutzim‚Äù. * The debts of all the different kibbutzim was redefined so that it would be fully paid for within 20 years. The remaining debt for the rest of the kibbutzim was defined as a \\"bubble\\". * The ‚Äúbubble‚Äù debt of the ‚ÄúPeripheral Kibbutzim‚Äù was deleted. It was determined that the ‚Äúbubble‚Äù debt of the ‚ÄúReal estate Kibbutzim‚Äù would be deleted after the real estate of these kibbutzim would be transferred to the Israel Land Administration and they would receive a compensation for the grounds. * The Kibbutzim would transfer 25 percent of their holdings in Tnuva to the state. Since the signing of the complementary settlement and until the end of 2003, the majority of the kibbutzim joined the settlement (out of the 135 kibbutzim that were supposed to take part). The settlement caused much criticism within the Israeli society. Many claimed that the settlement proved the state had a priority for a particular sector in the Israeli society, while the state was discriminatory towards many Israeli businesses that collapsed during those years as a result of the government's actions. However, the settlement did not only serve the interest of the kibbutzim, but also of the other parties involved in the settlement ‚Äì the banks managed to improve their financial situation after receiving the government deposits. Furthermore, due to the settlement they were able to significantly increase the repayment of kibbutz debt compared to the repayment of kibbutz debt before the signing of the complementary settlement. Similar settlements were made with a variety of other institutions in Israel, such as factories, Business group and other local authorities.  The status of kibbutzim today  In the discussions prior to the debt arrangements with the kibbutzim, a considerable amount of the kibbutz movement leaders opposed the arrangements, claiming they would end the kibbutzim, because the repayment capacity defined was set too high and therefore would not enable new growth to the kibbutzim. To some extent, it can be said that they were right because in practice, despite the vast improvement in performances of the Kibbutz business in recent years, many of the kibbutzim that signed on the debt arrangement could not repay the extent of the debt agreed upon. In addition, during the 1990s many kibbutz members, especially those that previously had leading roles in the kibbutzim, decided to leave the kibbutz. They did this mainly because, in their view, under the debt arrangements, the kibbutz was a body without a possibility of growth, under which the members‚Äô standard of living would be frozen during all the years of the arrangements (up until 2013). The debt arrangements accelerated the brain drain of the kibbutzim, which made them non-creative and sped their transformations to economic entities that would adapt organizational solutions of a capitalist society that conflicted with their own principles, which eventually led to the dismantling of the majority of the kibbutzim. Some argue that the debt arrangements, which were accompanied by monitoring and supervising of the conduct of the kibbutzim by the banks, eventually led to better economic conduct in most of the kibbutzim, which allowed them to improve their business performance in recent years. Nevertheless, alongside the improved business performance, most of the collective and collaborative culture in the kibbutz disappeared and only a few kibbutzim remained collaborative yet also adapted capitalist arrangements through the years. Since the change was done due to an economic and demographic distress, and as a result of the brain drain and the despair from the collaborative past that seemingly led to the crisis, attempts to rebuild the kibbutzim as collaborative and democratic bodies stopped, and the prosperous capitalist Israeli economy became the role model for the Israeli kibbutzim. Monetary compensation mechanisms were introduced according to members' occupations, which immediately decreased the standard of living of most Kibbutz members to the standard of living of a non-professional worker or professional worker, and raised the standard of living of the Kibbutz managers, most of which grew up in the kibbutz and received their education at the expense of the Kibbutz. The salary of the kibbutz managers was now as high as the salary of a manager in the private sector, which was 5-10 times higher than the Kibbutz members who financed their studies. These managers were supposed to ensure a fair pension for the veteran kibbutz members, but most of them did not do justice with the veterans who built the kibbutz they managed, and pensions did not reach the minimum agreed on by the kibbutz movement. In January 2008, the kibbutz movement followed through its part of the debt arrangements and gave 25% of their holdings in Tnuva to the state (financial value of about $100 million). Meanwhile, new debt arrangements were made with several kibbutzim, based on funds those kibbutzim received from the sale that were allocated to payment of the delayed debt to the banking system and the Jewish Agency.

DGD pioneered important technical innovations in MUDs, particularly disk-based object storage, full world persistence, separation of concerns between driver and mudlib, runtime morphism, automatic garbage collection, lightweight objects and LPC-to-C compilation. History DGD's first public release was on August 12, 1993. The first publicly available MUD to use DGD was PaderMUD (later Xyllomer), in December 1993. The original primary development MUD for DGD was The Pattern, referencing The Chronicles of Amber (like Croes's pseudonym Dworkin, which refers to Dworkin Barimen). It was taken offline sometime before February 1997. During the 1994-1995 academic year, DGD was a core element in a master's thesis at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. As part of the thesis work, a deterministic mechanism for handling arrays and mappings passed between objects was devised. In December 1995, exclusive rights to commercial use of DGD were acquired by BeeHive Internet Technologies, Inc., which sold an exclusive license to ichat in January 1996. ichat used DGD to establish the first Yahoo! chatrooms. ichat then became Acuity Corporation, which sold a sublicense to Skotos in February 1999. Skotos used DGD to create a series of online games. Acuity Corporation was later acquired by Quintus Corporation. In March 2001, the exclusive license was terminated due to the bankruptcy of that company. In 2002, DGD was used for academic research into persistent distributed object systems. In August 2005, DGD's commercial use rights were assigned back to Dworkin B.V., Croes's company. On February 3, 2010, DGD 1.4 was released as open-source software. Features Unlike other LPMud drivers, DGD has many powerful features specific to it that make it stand out as a game driver. These feature include persistence, Dynamic Recompilation, and statedumps, which allows a fully persistent system‚Äîno reboots and no reset system. A never-ending game world could be created. Persistence DGD supports persistence as a driver feature in ways that many languages simply can't. Using Dynamic Recompilation, coders never have to save objects to disk, reboot or recompile the logic for the objects, and then reload the objects from disk. Because DGD is also disk-based it can be persistent by swapping much of its unused memory to disk. Persistence is powerful and allows for behavior not experienced in most games. Some possibilities include... Not destroying objects left on the ground Not ever destroying NPC's nor randomly creating them en masse with zone resets State is not lost on reboot, except for the connection state of the player. Statedumps Statedumps are dumps of the state, or memory, to the hard disk, similar to how a computer dumps its memory to hard disk when it goes into hibernation. The driver can start from a statedump and have the game be exactly in the same state it was before reboot, minus network connections. This is why it is possible to reboot and easily maintain persistence of the way things were before the reboot. It also allows for a concept called virtual uptime, where while the game is actually down but when it comes back up it is still the same as it was before. This virtual uptime means the game has never reset itself in any way and all changes are persistent between real downtime. Dynamic Recompilation The dynamic recompilation feature allows one to recompile the logic of a master object during runtime, automatically upgrading all instances to the new version. Inherited objects cannot be recompiled in this way, they must instead be destructed and then compiled again. This will leave inheriting objects referring to the old version of the object, so they must in their turn either be recompiled, if possible, or destructed and compiled again in order to refer to the new version. Because of the restriction against recompiling inherited objects, it makes sense to separate inheritable objects from others, which is also done by the DGD Kernel Library. The recompilation mechanism is essential for persistent but evolving systems. Combined with statedumps, a reboot would only be necessary to update the driver and would probably be a transparent change to admins and users alike. Disk-based Transparent Swapping The DGD driver transparently swaps all the objects in memory to disk based on parameters that can be tuned by the admin of the game. The disk-based nature of the game allows one to never have to write code to load or save objects to and from the disk by oneself. The most commonly used objects are generally kept in memory to negate any non-trivial swapping cost and things are put to disk automatically based on when they were last accessed. This is also a powerful feature because it doesn't make the coders of the game responsible for what is in memory, which can dominate a lot of development time for any game programmer.

Seigar, Alister W. Graham, Helmut Jerjen, July 2007, Volume 378, Issue 4, pp. 1575-1588, , , (accessed 15 April 2010) cDs form around 20% of BCGs. Growth cD galaxies are believed to grow via mergers of galaxies that spiral in to the center of a galaxy cluster, a theory first proposed by Herbert J. Rood in 1965. This \\"cannibalistic\\" mode of growth leads to the large diameter and luminosity of the cDs. The second-brightest galaxy in the cluster is usually under-luminous, a consequence of its having been \\"eaten\\". Remains of \\"eaten\\" galaxies sometimes appear as a diffuse halo of gas and dust, or tidal streams, or undigested off-center nuclei in the cD galaxy. The envelope or halo may also consist of the \\"intra-cluster light\\", originating from stars stripped away from their original galaxy, and it can be up to 3 million light years in diameter. It is estimated that the cD galaxy alone contributes 1-7%, depending on the cluster mass, of the total baryon mass within 12.5 virial radii.Section 8 of Dynamical friction Dynamical friction is believed to play an important role in the formation of cD galaxies at the centres of galaxy clusters. This process begins when the motion of a large galaxy in a cluster attracts smaller galaxies and dark matter into a wake behind it. This over-density follows behind the larger galaxy and exerts a constant gravitational force on it, causing it to slow down. As it loses kinetic energy, the large galaxy gradually spirals toward the centre of the cluster. Once there, the stars, gas, dust and dark matter of the large galaxy and its trailing galaxies will join with those of other galaxies who preceded them in the same fate. A giant or supergiant diffuse or elliptical galaxy will result from this accumulation. The centers of merged or merging galaxies can remain recognizable for long times, appearing as multiple \\"nuclei\\" of the cD galaxy. cD clusters Type-cD galaxies are also used to define clusters.

During the summer months, Kimchi is made fresh, from seasonal vegetables. For one month, starting from the tenth moon of the year, people prepare large quantities of kimchi, to provide nutrition throughout winter. Gimjang was listed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in December 2013. Customs Kimchi can be eaten as an accompaniment to almost any meal, and is an important part of Korean culture. Recipes date back to at least the 13th century, when it was made from vegetables, pickles and either salt or a mixture of alcohol and salt. Red pepper was added to the ingredients in the 17th century. Modern day kimchi is typically made from napa cabbage and white radish, although there are hundreds of variations; it may also contain turnip, leek, carrots, and garlic. In the cooler weather of November, there are many crops in the fields and market-places, and the Gimjang process begins. The labour-intensive task is shared by families, relatives and neighbours. Groups of Korean people gather to cut the vegetables, wash them, and add salt to cure the food and begin the fermentation process. The nature of kimchi means that it is challenging to store for long periods; if it is too cold, it will freeze, and if it is too warm, it will over ferment, and may turn sour. The traditional solution prior to effective modern refrigeration is to store kimchi in earthenware jars in the ground, buried up to the neck level of the jar to prevent the contents from freezing. As the temperature falls below 0 ¬∞C, fermentation is halted and the food is preserved; it begins again as the temperature increases in spring time. The strong odors of kimchi can taint other products in a refrigerator, and despite modern advances in refrigeration, the custom of gimjang continues to be passed down the generations. It is common in cities for people to store large jars of fermenting kimchi on balconies. It is also increasingly common to own and use secondary refrigerators designed specifically for storing kimchi. In an attempt to combat the increasing popularity of mass-produced kimchi, which is convenient for modern life, Seoul has created the world's only kimchi museum, where tourists and local people can sample different types of the fermented dish, and learn about the traditional gimjang process. Although consumption figures have fallen, Koreans still consume of Kimchi per head each year.

North Meridian Street (left) as seen from the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument observation deck. US 31 formerly ran along North Meridian Street for much of its length in the city of Indianapolis, before being re- routed to a segment of Interstate 465. Meridian Street serves as the axis separating east addresses from west addresses, and intersects Monument Circle and Washington Street in downtown. North of downtown, Meridian continues through several prominent city neighborhoods, such as the Midtown commercial district, the Old Northside, Herron-Morton, Butler‚ÄìTarkington, Meridian- Kessler, and Arden, as well as the towns of Meridian Hills and Williams Creek. Meridian Street also passes through several historic districts: the North Meridian Street Historic District, the Old Northside Historic District, the Shortridge‚ÄìMeridian Street Apartments Historic District, the Washington Street‚ÄìMonument Circle Historic District, and the Indianapolis Union Station- Wholesale District. In 1919, property owners on Meridian Street from Monument Circle to the Central Canal proposed converting the street into a boulevard and putting it under the jurisdiction of the parks board to preserve its residential character. However, the increased demand for commercial property for an expanding downtown led to the proposal being defeated as property owners in the southern portion of the proposed boulevard sold their property to business interests. Nevertheless, in the early 1920s the portion of the street from Fall Creek to the canal was transferred to the parks board and a setback for new construction was imposed. In conjunction with the original proposal, an unsuccessful attempt was made to change the name of the street to Lincoln Boulevard in order to honor Abraham Lincoln in the same way that Washington Street honored George Washington. North of 40th Street to 57th Street, Meridian Street is considered to be among the most prestigious residential streets in Indiana. Some of the most impressive residential architecture in the United States can be found here, in a variety of architectural styles. The current Governor's Mansion can be found here, as well as the house that served as Governor's Mansion prior to the current house. The North Meridian Street Historic District is among the most affluent urban neighborhoods in the U.S., with a mean household income of $102,599 in 2017.

The diocese is headed by Archbishop Michael Dahulich, the diocesan bishop, who assumed control of the diocese after his consecration to the episcopacy on May 8, 2010. History The formal establishment of the Diocese of New York and New Jersey occurred after the OCA was granted autocephaly in 1970. As the diocese was the see of the ruling hierarch of the mission, and later of the autocephalous church, it supported the national Church's administration. The administrative offices were located, first, in New York City at the Holy Protection Cathedral and later, since about 1967, in Syosset. Upon the establishment of the Diocese of Washington in 1981, the metropolitan and primatal see transferred to the new diocese, leaving New York as a local diocese. It was merged with the Diocese of Washington in 2005 as the Diocese of Washington and New York. It was restored as a separate diocese in 2009, with Metropolitan Jonah, who remained bishop of the Washington diocese, as Locum tenens. After the reinstatement of the diocese, meetings were held to prepare for the election of a new hierarch. Eventually, Fr. Michael Dahulich was chosen, who was then consecrated the following spring and who remains the current bishop of the diocese. The oldest church in use is the Sts. Peter and Paul Orthodox Church located at Buffalo, New York.

The street follows the route of the National Road for almost all of its length in the city of Indianapolis. For a time, its entire length was designated as U.S. Route 40 (US 40) before that highway was re-aligned with the southern segment of Interstate 465 (I-465); now only the segments of Washington Street between I-465 and the city limits on either side of the city are part of US 40\\\\. US 40 follows Washington Street outside of I-465. The street delineates north‚Äìsouth address numbering for the eastern two-thirds of the city; Rockville Road separates north and south from the western border of the city until it meets Washington Street in Wayne Township at Tibbs Avenue. Route description Washington Street begins in the west at the intersection with Raceway Road. As it heads east-northeast, it passes by the Indianapolis International Airport, which lies to south. Immediately thereafter, it has an interchange with I-465 on the west side of the city, where US 40 diverges. After merging with Rockville Road, Washington Street heads more directly east toward downtown Indianapolis. Approaching downtown it passes the Indiana Medical History Museum on the former site of Central State Hospital for the Insane; it then passes the headquarters of the Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation, which is in buildings that once housed the Duesenberg Automobile and Motors Company. On the west side of downtown, Washington Street passes by the Indianapolis Zoo and White River Gardens, crosses the White River, and traverses White River State Park, with the Indiana State Museum and Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art on the north side of the street and Victory Field on the south. Within downtown, the street carries only westbound traffic; eastbound traffic is routed a block south to Maryland Street where it passes by the Indiana Convention Center. Among the buildings directly on Washington Street within the central business district are (from west to east): the Indiana Statehouse; the Indiana Theatre, home of the Indiana Repertory Theatre; the headquarters of the Simon Property Group; the Circle Centre shopping mall; the Barnes and Thornburg Building (which until the 1960s was the tallest building in the city); and the City-County Building. Washington also runs under the Indianapolis Artsgarden, a suspended glass structure at the intersection with Illinois Street. Washington does not intersect Monument Circle (the city's town square); rather, the Circle is located on Market Street, one block north of the intersection of Washington with Meridian Street. On the eastern edge of downtown, Washington Street has an interchange with the I-65/I-70 \\"Inner Loop\\". As it continues east, it travels through or by the Cole-Noble and Rural-Sherman neighborhoods. In the Irvington Historic District, an early suburb of Indianapolis, Washington crosses Pleasant Run Creek with its associated parkway and trail. On the far east side of the city, US 40 again joins Washington Street at the interchange with I-465. The street travels south of the Washington Square Mall as it approaches Cumberland, Indiana, where it terminates at Carroll Road.

The Museum In the museum it‚Äôs possible to find collections of archaeology, of religious art and of ethnography. The director of the museum is Ghjuvan Claudiu Ottaviani. The museum takes place in the Fort of Matra (14th century) situated in the old part of Aleria at about two kilometers from the modern village. The collections in the museum of Aleria pertain to fifteen centuries of history of Corsica and the same Aleria, from the 10th century BCE to the 5th century CE. Quite a lot of the exposed objects are of a great archaeological importance, both for that it concerns the knowledge of Corsica, but also for that of the Mediterranean world. This importance derives from the archaeological site of Aleria, that was not only one of the ancient capitals of Corsica, but that has also been during its history, colony of the Greeks from Phocaea, then of the Carthaginians, then of the Romans and that it has finally been invaded and destroyed by the Vandals in the 5th century. Among the remarkable artifacts in the museum that can be mentioned there are a dish representing one of the elephants of Hannibal in march, two Greek cups for the libations (rhyton) having an extraordinary and rare zoomorphic shape reproducing a head of dog and that of a mule or an horse. Finally there are Greek, Roman and Etruscan ceramics and vases, arms of bronze, amphoras, coins and many objects of daily life. The Fort Of Matra The Fort of Matra is a monument classified as national monument from 1962. It was built by the Genoeses in the 14th century. It was headquarter of a squadron of cavalry, whose mission was to guard the territories of the district, the oriental coast and the zone of the coastal ponds. In fact, the military importance of the fort derived from its strategic position being situated on top of an impending hill. During the centuries the fort had become a deposit of weapons for the Genoeses and for this reason, in 1729, it was partially destroyed from the Corsican that were rebelling them. The fort, reconstructed subsequently, has welcomed the king Theodore I of Corsica during his short kingdom over Corsica. Subsequently it came in the hands of the powerful family Matra, that has had the control of the fort. Mariu Emmanuele Matra was the most known Matra family member in the struggle against Pasquale Paoli for the rule over Corsica. He died March 28 th 1757, but the fort remained within the ownership of his family. The following year to its classification as national monument, in 1963, a deposit of the picked archaeological material was installed in the fort collecting all the material coming from the district and above all what found during the excavations effected in the old Aleria, at only some hundred meters of distance from the fort. After 1979 the fort of Matra was purchased by the Haute-Corse department of France and this material became the basis of the new Museum.

Summary George Edward Meyer settled here in 1854. When he became postmaster in 1865, he named the community after himself.Information about the first settler at Rural Routes During World War II, a labour camp was approved for Glen Meyer, to house enemy merchant seamen held as prisoners of war who would work under guard at local farms. In 1974, radio station CKOT (now CJDL-FM) received permission to move its transmitter to Glen Meyer. In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Glen Meyer became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk. The term \\"Glen Meyer\\" refers to an Iroquoian aboriginal culture related to the Neutral Nation people. Glen Meyer's earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300‚Äì350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of their skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois in the year 1651. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas. Climate The winter of 1975 was the only unusually mild winter in the region from 1897 to 1977. From the late 1990s onwards, winters have become more mild due to changes in climate brought on by global warming. Glen Meyer traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone, even with the recent mild winters and warmer dry summers. As in all communities, towns and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Glen Meyer over the decades. The warmest summers that Glen Meyer has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Should the sea levels rise by , Glen Meyer would not be affected by flooding. However, it may be affected by droughts as a by-product of the dislocation of available fresh water and may be forced to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from the Eastern United States. Constructing the proper infrastructure to carry the water hundreds of miles away would take considerable manpower along with significant economic costs and an unprecedented level of cooperation from multiple federal, state/provincial, and municipal governments.

Retrieved: 2012-09-26. is a tidal estuary which runs through the middle of the Gaeltacht Kilcommon parish in Erris, County Mayo, Ireland. It is of historical importance in Irish legend, an important marine habitat, an E.U. Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and an EU Special Protected Area (Birds Directive). Its translated name in English, \\"Stream of the Long Hound\\", reflects its general shape. It enters the Atlantic Ocean through Broadhaven Bay, another Special Area of Conservation. The estuary measures approximately 8.4 square kilometres and consists of a north-westerly-orientated main channel fed by the Glenamoy and Muingnabo rivers. A second channel flows around the village of Rossport from the northwest and is fed by the Gweedaney stream. Both channels join into a fast flowing channel which widens out into an exposed bay at the mouth of the estuary.http://www.wfdfish.ie/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Sruwaddacon.pdf The lower portion of Sruwaddacon Bay has exceptionally strong currents.  Natural history  Most of the estuary is dominated by marine species with little depth in the upper and middle sections at low water and a significant intertidal area. It has few anthropogenic impacts with a mostly agricultural catchment and the small village of Rossport located at the centre of its two main channels. The outer area of the estuary is predominately sand and sand dunes where it flows into and out of Broadhaven Bay, the mid-estuary is mainly hard substrates of cobble and rock while the upper estuary has a mixture of sand and mud substrates. There are patchy areas of Fucus cover in the middle and lower areas of the estuary but the majority is unvegetated. Salinity values recorded at beach sites were high in the middle and lower estuary ‚Äì around 30 p.p.t. Salinity values close to freshwater were found at the confluence of the Glenamoy and Muingnabo rivers. This estuary and Broadhaven Bay into which it drains, is an important breeding ground for salmon, whales and dolphins and of importance to the local fishing and recreation industries. There are extensive areas of intertidal mudflats characterised by polychaete communities and bivalves. There are Atlantic salt flats which fringe on the blanket bog, particularly in the lower reaches of the bay. Species growing here include sea thrift, sea arrowgrass, sea plantain, common salt marsh grass, Juncus gerardii, Juncus maritimus and turf fucoids. The bay supports breeding terns of several varieties and black-headed gulls, including the red- breasted merganser and sand martin.  In popular culture  The 18th-century song Liam √ì Raghallaigh is based on the drowning of a young man on his wedding day in Sruwaddacon Bay when he and friends rowed across the bay to collect the priest for his wedding and their boat sank. The song, written in the first person as spoken by his bride and widow, Neil√≠ Nic Si√∫rt√°in, mourns the loss, and curses the craftsmen who made the boat with cheap wood; in translation, she sings: \\"Your eyes are with the eels, Your mouth is with the crabs, Your two bright, clear-bright hands Are under the sharp discipline of the salmon\\".http://old.tg4.ie/en/programmes/archive/mairtin-mac-donnchadha/liam-o- raghallaigh.html Archaeology The archaeological survey carried out in 2008 for Royal Dutch Shell by the Archaeological Diving Company in Sruwaddacon Bay took some sample cores from the bay. One of their cores close to Aghoose townland turned up hazelnut shells at a depth of 10.7 metres under the bay. These have been held for analysis to be dated by the archaeological team concerned.Corrib Gas (2009) EIS Appendix M ‚Äì Underwater Surveyhttps://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irishwoman-s-diary-on- m√°ire-n%C3%AD-cill%C3%ADn-maud-gonne-and-1916-1.2629883  Corrib gas project  The latest plans of the controversial Corrib gas project are to run a high pressure, raw, unodourised natural gas pipeline up the middle of this bay.

The club competed in the National Superior Basketball (, BSN). History The team was founded in 2005, when the now extinct Toritos de Cayey franchise was relocated as the Grises de Humacao. In 2010, Antonio \\"Tonin\\" Casillas, the team owner decided to give the franchise a makeover and changed the name to Caciques de Humacao. The main reason was to reflect a more positive image on a city which has always been known as the \\"gray\\" city. The change also shifted the public opinion on to the Taino heritage of the city and honors the great chieftain Jumacao who fought a rebellion against the Spanish over 500 years ago. In 2017, the team was relocated in the middle of the season to Isabela and became Gallitos de Isabela after the owner of the Caciques, Daniel Maes, was banned from the league. In 2018 owner Rafael Rivera moved his team \\"Brujos de Guayama\\" to the town and changed the name of the team to Caciques de Humacao, thus reviving the franchise.
