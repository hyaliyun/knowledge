He was inducted into the Austin Music Memorial in 2011, the Austin Chronicle’s Texas Music Hall of Fame in 2000, and was a five-time recipient of the Austin Best String Player Award.  Early life  Hood grew up in Spartanburg, South Carolina. His mother was a housewife and his father owned a lumberyard. Hood learned to play Dobro resonator guitar in his early teens, then he played electric guitar in local band Washington Subway.  Career = Early career  In his senior year of high school, Hood met Walter Hyatt. Their first collaboration was the Walter Hyatt Consort. When David Ball joined them, they formed Uncle Walt's Band. When they decided a fiddle player would be a good sound for their band, he learned to play the fiddle as an adult. Champ also had a vocal range of almost three octaves. After moving to Nashville, in 1972 they met Willis Alan Ramsey, who persuaded them to perform and record in Texas. After that, they moved back to Spartanburg to record their eponymous debut record. They disbanded in 1975 so they could form new bands. Hood and Hyatt returned to Nashville and performed in a band called the Contenders. In 1978, they reunited with Ball to re-form Uncle Walt's Band. They appeared on Austin City Limits in 1980, then broke up again in 1983 to pursue solo careers.  Late 1970s and onward  In the late 70s and early 80s, Hood regularly performed at EmmaJoe's at the Alamo Hotel with Butch Hancock, David Rodriguez, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and Ray Wylie Hubbard. Hood performed with Lyle Lovett, Kelly Willis, and Guy Clark on guitar and fiddle. He also performed with Blaze Foley, Mandy Mercier, Sarah Elizabeth Campbell, and with David Halley. For eleven years, in the late 80s and for most of the 90s, Hood performed with Jimmie Dale Gilmore's band in a weekly Wednesday night gig at Threadgill's. When Gilmore signed with a major label, Hood took over the Threadgill's Troubadours (Marvin Dykhuis, David Heath, and Ron Erwin) for a reincarnation of the Threadgill's Restaurant's Wednesday night Singin' and Supper Sessions. Hood played in singer Toni Price's band for more than nine years. Price's Tuesday night \\"Hippie Hour\\" early show at the Continental Club also featured guitarists \\"Scrappy\\" Jud Newcomb, Rich Brotherton, and Rick \\"Casper\\" Rawls.  Death and legacy  In spring of 2001, Hood was diagnosed with cancer. He was working on his first and only solo album when he died. Bon Haven was released posthumously on January 20, 2002. Toni Price recorded her album Born to be Blue in 2003, with each song intended as a tribute to Champ Hood, with whom she had been so close. Walter Hyatt died in 1996 in the ValuJet Flight 592 plane crash in the Everglades. After Uncle Walt's Band broke up the second time, David Ball went on to record successful country albums (beginning with Thinkin' Problem in 1994). Hood's son Warren Hood is a multi-instrumentalist, songwriter and singer who toured as a member of The Waybacks. He has also performed and/or recorded with Lyle Lovett, Joan Osborne, Emmylou Harris, Little Feat, Elvis Costello, the Bodeans, Susan Tedeschi, Gillian Welch, and Alejandro Escovedo. His own band – Emily Gimble keyboards, vocals), guitarist Willie Pipkin (guitar), Nate Rowe (bass), and Corey Keller (drums) – have recorded and toured extensively. Champ's nephew Marshall Hood plays lead guitar in the Americana band The Belleville Outfit, with Toni Price, and with his own band, the Bads.  Personal life  In 1982, Hood married Elizabeth Haynes. They had one son, Warren Hood. They divorced in 1985.

On 10 June 2013, the Xian MA60 twin turboprop operating the route crashed on the runway while landing at Kupang's El Tari Airport, injuring 25 occupants, five seriously. The aircraft was severely damaged in the impact and subsequently written off. Investigation by the National Transportation Safety Committee, assisted by Chinese Civil Aviation Administration of China, concluded that the flight crew's mismanagement of the engine controls lead to a loss of propeller thrust and lift shortly before touchdown, resulting in a hard landing far in excess of the airframe's structural limits. Accident Flight 6517 departed Bajawa Turulelo Soa Airport at 09.00 a.m local time carrying 46 passengers and 4 crews on board with an ETA of 9:40 a.m. The flight was uneventful until its landing. First Officer Au Young Vunpin was the pilot flying and Captain Aditya Pri Joewono was the Pilot Monitoring. At 09:22, the flight crews made first communication with El Tari Control Tower controller (El Tari Tower) and reported their position and maintaining 11,500 ft. The pilot received information that the runway in use was 07 and the weather information. Flight 6517 later descended approved their descent clearance of 5.000 ft. At 09.38 local time, the crew reported the aircraft was passing 10,500 ft and stated that the flight was on Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC). El Tari Airport then obtained visual contact with Flight 6517 and issued a landing clearance. At 09.51 a.m, the crew reported that their position was on final and the El Tari Tower re-issued the landing clearance. Flight 6517 then retracted its landing gear. On 10.15 a.m, Flight 6517 bounced for three times and slammed onto the tarmac. It broke into two sections. Both the left wing and the right wing were bent forward and both propellers were destroyed. Eyewitness recalled that there was a massive explosion when the crash occurred. It then skidded for several meters. After the aircraft stopped, the flight attendants assessed the situation and decided to evacuate the passengers through the rear main entrance door. A total of 25 people were injured in the crash. One pilot and four passengers who seated on row number three, seven and eight suffered serious injury. Several injured passengers suffered shock from the crash and was taken into El Tari's VVIP Lounge. Several people were admitted to the airport's military hospital, the Kupang Military Hospital, located on the west of the airport. Several of the injured were taken to the Prof. Dr. WZ Johannes Public Hospital. Military personnel immediately assisted the survivors and sterilized the crash site. Aircraft PK-MZO, the aircraft involved in the accident, seen here in 2012 The aircraft involved in the crash was a Xian MA60 registered in Indonesia as PK-MZO with a serial number of MSN 608. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127J. It had its first flight in 2010 with a total airframe hours of 4.486 and cycles of 4.133. The aircraft was delivered to Merpati Nusantara Airlines in 2010. Passengers and crews { class=\\"sortable wikitable floatright\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%\\"; - style=\\"background:#ccf;\\" !

One passenger was an American citizen, identified as Aloysius Deene. The co-pilot was a Malaysian. However, various media falsely reported the co-pilot nationality as South Korea. The pilot of the flight was identified as Aditya Pri Joewono and the co-pilot was identified as Au Young Vunpin. Captain Aditya joined the company on 1 November 1994. He had a total flying hours of 12.530 hours, in which 2.050 hours of them were on the Xian MA60. Captain Aditya was qualified as route instructor and has been performed approximately 218 instructing flight hours. First Officer Vunpin was new to the company and had just acquired a total flying hours of 58 hours. Merpati spokesman stated that First Officer Vunpin was still in training, having joined the company for only 3 months.First Officer Vunpin was on training program with approximately 141 hours, including 24 hours as observer. The operator had planned to checked First Officer Vunpin to be a qualified first officer on the next schedule but he requested another multi days schedule to be more confident prior to flight check. Aftermath Immediately after the crash, El Tari Airport was closed by the airport operators, as well as the local authorities, meaning that no flights could either depart or arrive at the airfield. The airport was closed for an extended time and would be reopened when the wreckage of the incident aircraft was removed. At least 7 flights were delayed, and several other flights were diverted. Every flight was cancelled that was scheduled between 10p.m. and 6a.m. The wreckage of the incident aircraft was hastily removed from the runway, allowing the airfield to reopen. Transportation Ministry stated that Merpati Nusantara Airlines would face a \\"special audit\\" in response to the crash. Only 8 Xian MA60 operated by Merpati were allowed to fly. As such, the ministry would checked the airworthiness of Merpati's Xian MA60 fleet. The Ministry would checked on the maintenance and spare parts. Merpati lost approximately Rp. 100 billion due to the crash, causing more economic problems in the airline. Investigation The Vice Minister of Transportation Ministry Bambang Susanto immediately ordered three main things in response to the crash, which were evacuation process of the survivors, immediate investigation by the National Transportation Safety Committee, and immediate clean-up at El Tari Airport. Most survivors stated that before the plane touched the runway, the aircraft \\"swayed and shook\\" for several times. Shortly afterwards the aircraft bounced and slammed onto the tarmac. Investigators then analysed the FDR and CVR. The FDR was downloaded in Surabaya on 13 June with good quality. Further analysis was conducted in Jakarta. Based on the FDR analysis of the flight's approach, the approach was not on profile as published for runway 07, while the approach angle greater than 2.9°. Investigators then noticed that the left power lever was in the range of BETA MODE while the aircraft altitude was approximately 112 ft and followed by the right power lever at 90 ft until hit the ground. The FDR also recorded a vertical acceleration of +5.99 G followed by -2.76 G and stopped recording 0.297 seconds after touchdown. The CVR was downloaded at NTSC facility on 12 June 2013 and contained 120 minutes of good quality recording. The audio files were examined found to contain the accident flight. The recording showed that First Officer Vunping intended to reduce the power to correct the speed. Then, sounds similar to changing of engine and propeller were heard in the recording. First Officer Vunpin then exclaimed \\"Oops\\", possibly realizing his mistake. The aircraft then impacted terrain. Noticed by the abnormal situation on the thrust lever, investigators then examined it. The power levers should have prevented to move from flight idle to ground idle during flight by the function of Electric Magnetic Lock Systems and Mechanical Power Lever Stop Slot. At the accident aircraft was found that the electric magnetic lock system (Power Lever lock) was on open position. With power lever lock on open position, the solenoid of the electric magnetic lock system disengage and allow the power lever moves to ground idle in flight whenever the mechanical power lever stop slots lifted. Based on simulator test conducted by the NTSC, if the engine entered this condition, the aircraft would lose lift and eventually descended rapidly. The movement of power lever to ground idle will result to the propeller pitch angle changes to low pitch angle which produces significant drag. The NTSC stated that because it happened on 112 ft, it was impossible to not crash. Interviews from Merpati officials revealed that the first two aircraft had several problems on the Power Lever Lock System, whereas the automatic power lever lock system sometimes failed to open after landing. In May 2008, the board of instructors had agreed to revise the Normal Checklist that the Power Lock system selects to “OPEN” before landing. However, further analysis revealed that there were no faults in the engines. Investigators then turned on the pilot who flew the plane, First Officer Vunpin. First Officer Vunpin have some experiences of delay on moving the power lever to Ground Idle during landing. On the accident flight, he aware to previous experienced and lifted the mechanical power lever stop slots during approach. He realized that he retarded the Power Lever backward at about 70 ft of aircraft altitude and unintentionally entered the Beta Range. Interviews with First Officer Vunpin revealed that he have some experiences of delay on moving the power lever to Ground Idle during landing. This experience became his belief (cognitive). First Officer Vunpin has been planned to do the flight check to be qualified First Officer, and he wanted to prove that he was qualified as a First Officer. Knowing that he had repeated the errors in the past flights, he tried to prove that he had overcome his errors. However, he unintentionally moved the power lever beyond flight idle (behavioral). The aircraft lost lift and subsequently crashed.

History  A postage stamp, featuring Maksym Rylsky The Institute takes its origin from a number of art and ethnographic centres that emerged during the 1920s. Thus, in 1921 the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences established the Ethnographic Commission (1921–1933), which played a leading role in preservation and development of ethnographic and folkloristic sciences in Ukraine. The Vovk Centre of Anthropology and Ethnology [also known as the Vovk Museum [or Cabinet] of Anthropology and Ethnology] (1921–1934), named after Fedir Vovk, oversaw the anthropological and ethnographic research studies of the entire territory of Ukraine. A separate research institution was entirely dedicated to studies of Ukrainian folk music: The Centre of Music Ethnography [also known as Cabinet] (1922–1935). In 1936 the Ukrainian Folklore Institute was established under the umbrella of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences. At that time it consisted of the Narrative Folklore Department, the Folk Music Department, and Archives. Its Lviv branch was established in 1939, with Filaret Kolessa as its first director. In 1964, the Institute was named after Maksym Rylsky, who was its long-standing director (1942–1964). The Institute was given its current name in 1994.Official Website of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine  Departments and centres  The Institute is a leading research institution in Ukraine of ethnographical, historical and cultural studies of the country.

His contributions were fundamental to the development and teaching of building science in the twentieth century. Biography Odone's mother was left a widow and she had to face economic difficulties which affected Odone’s childhood. Because of the economic problems Odone was forced to leave school in order to obtain a necessary income so he started to work. Although his interests for the lecture and the passion for the study didn't allow him to stop developing his culture. He started to be an working student, he worked during the day and studied at night. He frequented The “Universita Popolare” and after three years he graduated at Aldini-Valeriani technical institute. After graduation he started to work at Aldini-Valeriani as a teacher assistant of Physics and Electronics. During that period he enrolled himself to school of application of engineers at Celestini square. After two years of study he was forced to participate in war as artillery officer. He got his academic degree in 1921. In 1927 he obtained a licence to become a teacher. In 1928 professor Albenga was called to hold the chair of Building Bridges at the Polytechnic University of Turin and he proposed Odone as his substitute in Science of Construction and after three years in 1931 Odone won a contest and could teach Science of Structures in Bologna. He was awarded by the Alessandro Volta foundation of Italy Academy. Afterwards he was also awarded Vallauri foundation Odone Belluzzi enjoyed his success in life, right in the period when the university colleges of Engineering and the studies in Construction Science were reaching a high level and were competing among them to get preeminence. During the summer of 1954 he flew to Brazil to hold a tour of courses and conferences. Unfortunately he had health problems probably due to hot climate and got sick and weak. When he came back to Bologna, he had to undergo a surgery, followed by a period of rehabilitation. Even if he loved walking on Bologna's hills, his wealth problems forced him give up his passion and made him stay at home all the time. Despite his sickness, he wanted to teach at university, because he didn't want to disappoint his students. In may of 1956 he held his last lesson, all of his students filled the lecture hall and thanked him with a standing ovation. It's on 24 August of the same year that Odone Belluzzi, still with lucid mind, dies. Treatise of buildings science The work “Scienza delle Costruzioni” of the school Odone Belluzzi, is a relevant work which aims at teaching the subject Scienza delle Costruzioni in the university departments of architecture and engineering. Originally, it was divided into three volumes, now is composed of four. “Scienza delle Costruzioni” is an extraordinary piece of work, which has demanded few years, in which every word is evaluated with accurate precision and passion. The greatness of the author is visible, since he is skillfully able to communicate successfully the most difficult and complicated concepts starting from the easiest ones, gradually growing, evaluating new difficulties, explaining the text with comments and notes so to get concepts easier. The work is also exemplified through lots of exercises, usually with different methods, with the aim of showing prominent aspects and advantages. The student in this way is encouraged and stimulated in a subject which seems apparently difficult. Moreover, the student easily and spontaneously grasps, understands and examines the phenomenon. The work deals with every aspect of the subject starting from its basis, which are linked with statistics and analytic mechanics. In the first volume (1940–41) is developed a theory about elastic beam's strain, proving in a simple mode the respective formulas and theorem. That method allows the evolving of the linear beam's, continuum beam's, frame's and even structure's calculus. The second volume (1943–50) is about the elastic arch structure, the steel structure's implementation. The third volume (1961) is about the slab structure's, sheet structure's, vault structure's problem and is about the plastic material's performance. The fourth volume (1955) expound on balance's instability's problem and vibration's problem. The treatise was published from Zanichelli and was translated in several language. Odone Belluzzi guaranteed that the treatise will be effective for half an century, and so it was.

History The castle was probably built by the Della Gherardesca which became masters of the south-west of Sardinia after the partition of Giudicato of Cagliari that took place in 1258. However, according to another hypothesis, its construction would be dated to the 12th century, during the reign of William I of Cagliari. It's located on the border between the territory of Ugolino della Gherardesca (curatoria of Cixerri) and the heirs of Gherardo della Gherardesca (curatorie of Sulcis, Nora and Decimo). It was occupied for a short period, between 1290 and 1295 approximately, from Guelfo della Gherardesca, son of the late Count Ugolino, who was trying to conquer the land held by the other Della Gherardesca: Ranieri and Boniface. Following the wars between the giudicato of Arborea and the Kingdom of Sardinia, the castle assumed again a military function; the documents show that it was conquered and occupied temporarily by Brancaleone Doria, husband of Eleanor of Arborea. The castle, in later centuries, passed into the hands of various Aragonese feudal lords. Bibliography *Anna Paola Deiana - Il castello di Gioiosa Guardia: fonti e testimonianze archeologiche, Ed.

Front view of the Renaissance Villa Pandolfini  History and description  The villa was commissioned by Battista Pandolfini and built in the late 15th century (1485–1488) to a design attributed to Desiderio da Settignano. The Pandolfini family already owned the medieval tower that is currently in front of the main entrance to the villa. Under the ownership of Agnolo Pandolfini, a friend of Cosimo de' Medici, the tower hosted historical figures such as Leon Battista Alberti, Benedetto da Rovezzano, Pope Eugene IV, Renais D'Anjou, Francesco Sforza. The presence in the villa of Charles VIII of France is documented in 1495, just before he was about to enter Florence with his army. Villa Pandolfini remained substantially the same until the 17th century, when Filippo Pandolfini made some alterations: constructing a large terrace on the main facade towards the Via Livornese, and the chapel. The arrangement of the garden dates from 1633. The solidity of the structural works appears when the changes are compared with the plan of the villa designed by Giovanni Vasari The Young at the end of the 16th century, at any time prior to the restoration. Today, Villa Pandolfini has an interior design consistent with Italian 19th century taste. The living room overlooking the loggia has a frescoed ceiling with bucolic subjects typical of a neo-classicism Arcadian hunting scene. The Ducessois-Prat family, arrived in Italy after the French Revolution, took over from the Pandolfinis and the Samminiatelli family, and made further changes: 19th century restorations are visible in the garden, especially in the Rocaille pavilion. In the last decades, Villa Pandolfini returned to an Italian owner, the Brogi family, and it currently houses the \\"Azienda Agricola Marchesi Prat\\" and the Italian Academy of Cuisine Pandolfini, founded in the 1990s.

It is part of a series of lakes which developed in the Titicaca basin along with Lake Mataro and Lake Cabana, reaching an altitude of . Lake Ballivián itself is of late Quaternary age and may have influenced the spread and development of animals in the Altiplano. In the southern Altiplano, Lake Escara may be coeval with Lake Ballivián.  Context  The Altiplano in South America is a high plateau between the Eastern Cordillera and the Western Cordillera with an average altitude of and a surface area of . A number of evaporation landforms can be found in the Altiplano, including Salar de Uyuni and Salar de Coipasa. In the northern Altiplano lies Lake Titicaca. While the present-day Altiplano has an arid-semiarid climate, it was formerly occupied by large lakes that grew and dried out in many phases. Of these lakes, Lake Ballivián and Lake Minchin were among the first to be described. Lake Mataro and Lake Cabana were later described in 1984 as previous ancient lakes in the Titicaca basin prior to Lake Ballivián. The name Ballivián was coined in 1909, it refers to the Bolivian scholar Don Manuel Vicente Ballivian. Sometimes that name is used to simply refer to precursor lakes of Titicaca.  Lake  Lake Ballivián reached an altitude of . Another terrace at a height of may correspond to a lake level drop of Ballivián or to a prolonged standstill. An erosion surface at elevation and associated clays were formerly attributed to Lake Ballivián but today shorelines at that elevation are associated with Lake Cabana which predates glaciation. The water surface would have covered , about one and a half as large as present day Lake Titicaca, and extended farther south than the present-day Lake Titicaca while its eastern and western margins largely coincided with the present-day margins of Lake Titicaca. In some places, archipelagoes, gulfs and islands such as the present-day Copacabana Peninsula formed. It is documented from the Lake Titicaca basin, where it forms lacustrine abrasion surfaces and deposits of clay and sand at a height of above the lake level. The Azangaro Formation in Peru and Ulloma Formation in Bolivia are deposits of Lake Ballivián, as are clays around Lake Titicaca. Remains of the lake are found on the western and southern sides of the lake basin. An old theory envisaged that Lake Ballivián or some other precursor of Lake Titicaca originally was a northwestern prolongation of the Rio La Paz valley before gravelly deposits dammed it, or of a Pacific-draining valley which was blocked by volcanic activity. Lake Ballivián is of late Quaternary age, it may have formed between 600,000 - 500,000 years ago. Such a dating is supported by fossils found in sediments left by the lake. The existence of Lake Ballivián in the Titicaca basin may coincide with the existence of Lake Escara, and preceded the existence of Lake Minchin. The water levels of Escara were much lower than these of Ballivián, indicating that the Ulloma-Capalla sill did exist at that time. It is possible that waters from Lake Ballivián broke through at Calacoto into the Rio Mauri valley, rapidly cutting down a new valley and draining the lake. The formation of the Rio Desaguadero outlet may have stabilized future lake levels. A tectonic event shortly before the formation of the lake formed a trough which is now the location of Lake Titicaca. The interglacial Sorata-Choqueyapu I may be contemporaneous to Lake Ballivián, as would be the Saale glaciation in Europe and the Illinoian glaciation in North America. During the Lake Ballivián episode, pupfish colonized the southern and central Altiplano. The diversification of Heleobia and Hyalella crustaceans, Orestias fish as well as the speciation of Biomphalaria snails may have also been influenced by the development of Lake Ballivián. The sponge Balliviaspongia is named after Lake Ballivián.  References = Sources     External links * Results of an Expedition to the Central Andes, contains images of lake deposits.

In the US, \\"The Full House\\" was one of five episodes that were not aired as part of the original broadcast of Jeeves and Wooster on Masterpiece Theatre, though all episodes were made available on US home video releases. The episode \\"Honoria Glossop Turns Up\\" was aired as the second episode of the third series instead.  Background  Adapted from \\"Jeeves and the Hard- boiled Egg\\" (collected in Carry On, Jeeves) and \\"The Aunt and the Sluggard\\" (collected in Carry On, Jeeves).

One involves poet Rockmetteller \\"Rocky\\" Todd who wants a quiet life in his cabin in the Long Island woods. But his wealthy aunt, Isabel Rockmetteller, whom he is named after, wants him out clubbing every night and to send her a report of what is going on. Rocky is afraid of being cut out of her will if he does not do as she says. Jeeves goes clubbing in his place and Rocky writes reports based on Jeeves' experiences. However, he makes it sound so good that the aunt decides to come to for herself. Bertie is forced to lend Rocky his flat, since that is the address given to Aunt Isabel in Rocky's letters. Meanwhile, Edgar Gascoyne Bickersteth, 8th Duke of Chiswick, the luxury-hating father of Francis Bickersteth (\\"Bicky\\") believes, that his son is in Colorado learning farming if he wants to keep his allowance. Bicky is staying in New York and the Duke of Chiswick finds out. He arrives in New York and believes Bertie's apartment belongs to his son, and seeing that Bicky is apparently doing well, cuts his allowance off. Since Bicky needs funds to start a chicken farm, something he believes will make him independent of his allowance, this happens at an unfortunate time for him. Jeeves solves Rocky's dilemma by giving Aunt Isabel misleading directions to a show; she ends up at a temperance meeting which causes her to change her views, and she insists on Rocky leaving New York in order to live quietly in the countryside. As for Bicky's situation, Jeeves suggests charging a fee to let people shake the Duke's hand, which would give Bicky enough money for the chicken farm. His father would not approve of the scheme and has to be convinced that a large group of men who queue up to shake his hand are all friends of his son. The ruse is discovered, however, and the Duke tells Bicky he must come back to England with him, when Jeeves suggests that the story about the deceived Duke could be sold to the newspapers. As the Duke abhors reporters, he agrees to keep paying Bicky an allowance.

It came to his notice that there were devotees frequenting an Anthill at the present site of the temple. The Maharaja visited the anthill and prayed that if his uncle is cured of the eye disease, he would build a temple at the site for the Lord. Once the Maharaja reached Mysore, it was brought to his notice that his uncle was cured of the eye disease. The temple was constructed to thank the Lord as a votive offering. There is a sculpture of sage Mandavya in the Mantapam. As per one of the versions, Sage Mandavya had this temple built on being directed by the Lord.

The park is located on Guildford Road near Aldershot Cricket Club and the Lido and is owned and maintained by Rushmoor Borough Council.Aldershot Park on the Rushmoor Borough Council website History Aldershot Park Mansion in 1962 There is some evidence that the original manor in Aldershot Park dated to the early medieval period. This manor was acquired in the 16th century by Sir John White whose family were originally traders in wool. In 1599 his son Robert White died without male heirs and his estate was left to his two daughters - Ellen, the wife of Richard Tichborne, and Mary, the wife of Walter Tichborne, brother of Richard and so the manor passed to the Tichborne family.Aldershot Park History Notes The Tichbornes were the biggest landowners in Aldershot and the brothers Sir Richard and Sir Walter Tichborne were favourites of James I who was godfather to Walter’s son James, born in 1611, and the king travelled to Aldershot for the christening at nearby St Michael's church. James I returned to Aldershot in 1618, 1622 and 1623 when he stayed with the Tichbornes at their mansion in Aldershot Park built in the style of a castle with a moat and large garden. However, by the time of Charles I this was becoming run down. When Charles visited in August 1627 a Spanish Ambassador asked to have an urgent audience. To the embarrassment of the Tichbornes the king replied that the house at Aldershot was unfit for such a meeting and arranged it for the following week at Oatlands Palace, near Weybridge. During the Civil War the Tichbornes were Royalists and as a result suffered loss of property and status during the Commonwealth. Although they received some compensation after the restoration of Charles II the family was deep in debt so James Tichborne (great-grandson of Sir Walter) eventually was forced to sell Aldershot Park. In 1842 the estate was bought by Charles Barron who built Aldershot Park Mansion. He died in 1859. Later the estate was sold to John Back, on whose death it was purchased by Charles D'Oridant, the owner of the Pavilion Hotel at Folkestone. From him it passed by purchase to a Miss Kennedy.Aldershot Park - British History Online The land of Aldershot Place, as it was later named, was acquired by Aldershot Urban District Council in 1920 and part was used for the building of the Park estate of council housing, and part retained as the public park we have today.

The game is considered a spiritual successor to Bloodline Champions and is created by the same developers. An early access version of the game was released in September 2016, selling over 440,000 copies within three months, and was officially released on November 7, 2017. In May 2018, the developers announced the development of a new free-to-play game mode based on the battle royale genre planned to be released in the summer of the same year. In August 2018, the developers announced that the game mode would no longer be free and instead would be released as a standalone game planned to be released by the end of September of the same year. In July 2019, Stunlock Studios announced that active work on the title would stop. October of the same year saw the last content update; both Battlerite and Battlerite Royal were to stay in \\"maintenance mode\\" for the foreseeable future. Gameplay Battlerite consists of two teams, with two or three players each, battling against each other. Before the game begins, each player chooses a unique playable character called a Champion with unique offensive, defensive, and movement abilities. Defeating every player on the enemy team wins the round for your team, and winning three rounds wins your team the game. Rounds have a timer of around two minutes, and when the timer runs out a Sudden Death boundary appears which gradually forces players into a small area in the center of the map. Games may be played on one of several maps, each favoring different strategies. Unlike traditional MOBA games, the goal of the game is not to destroy towers or other base structures. Additionally, players do not kill neutral units to gain resources, and therefore players cannot buy items or other resources in the game to augment their character's stats or abilities. This leads to an action- focused gameplay with in short matches compared to the longer strategy-focused games common in the genre. Reception Battlerite received mainly favorable reviews from critics; on aggregate review website Metacritic the game attains an overall score of 85 out of 100. PC Gamer gave the game a score of 89%, praising the game's pace, free-to-play model, and simplicity compared to other games in its genre. Similarly, IGN Ian Nowakowski gave Battlerite a score of 8.2/10. While criticizing the randomized progression rewards as \\"lackluster,\\" Nowakowski concludes \\"Battlerite strikes true where it counts, and that’s in the arena. The teamfighting hits hard at the core of what makes competitive gaming so engaging hour after hour.\\" Battlerite quickly rose in popularity upon launch. Two weeks after the game launched on Steam's Early Access, Stunlock Studios claimed they had already amassed 200,000 players, despite the fact that at the time the game was pay-to-play. As of right now, Battlerite has a small player base. According to SteamCharts, in 2017 player count peaked in November with 44,850 players in that month; as of 2018 the average monthly peak has decreased to less than 4,000. PC Gamer included Battlerite in its list of the best free games on the Steam platform.

It is practiced in many parts of the world as both an occupation and a sport. Commercial blade shearers shear on average 140 sheep in an 8-hour working day, but some will shear over 200 sheep in a day. History  Shearing the rams by Tom Roberts depicting blade shearing in AustraliaShearing is said to be one of the oldest occupations, as people needed fiber to make garments. Originally sheep and other animals were shorn using sharp glass or metal taking tufts of fiber at a time to harvest the fiber but slowly man adapted scissor-like blades to make the job easier. Machine shearing was invented in the early 1880s and slowly took over as the main form of shearing, but there is still a place for blade shearing in certain environments and also as a sport. Equipment 233x233px Blade shears with parts labeled Blade shears are similar to scissors, although most have the hinge at the back of the shears rather than the center but some still have the hinge in the center e.g. Jakoti shears. Conventional blade shears can come with a single bow, double bows or inverse bows. Double bow shears are by far the most common as they are the most versatile. Single bow shears and inverse bowed shears offer more resistance and are mostly only used for tough shearing sheep. They come in varying lengths from about 10 cm(4 inches) to 18.5 cm(7.25 inches). Most blade shears can be used straight from the factory but they usually give a rough cut and most people would not be able to shear for very long before wearing out their hand. Most blade shearers will either spend time 'doing up' their shears or buy already done up shears from other shearers. The process of doing up shears can take a couple of hours and consists of five main parts # Pulling back: this is bending the blades back, usually with a special device called a \\"pull back\\", so that the shearer can take more wool with each 'blow'. # Grinding: This puts a hollow grind on the blade to making sharpening faster and easier. Most shearers will also grind the points sharper so the blades enter the wool more easily. # Cutting out: this is the process of cutting notches and spikes on the blades for a knocker, thumb rest, and cockspur. # Putting the driver on. # Setting: this involves bending and shaping the blades so they line up and cut against each other in an optimal way for ease of shearing. Specialized equipment such as pull-backs and pendulums for grinders are used for some of the processes above which come at an expense which is one of the reasons many people buy shears from other shearers. Another reason people buy done-up shears is due to a lack of knowledge about doing-up shears, as many shearers in countries, like England, would only use a couple of pairs of shears in their life so would not spend the time learning how to do up shears for this. Once the shears are done up the shearers will still maintain the edge regularly. In most commercial shearing, shearers will usually sharpen every one or two sheep to keep the edge honed in order to make shearing easier. Shearers will usually use a sharpening stone or laminated diamond stone to keep the edge on their shears. As the stoning bevel gets too thick shearers will grind back their shears to speed up the sharpening process. Occupational= New Zealand  In New Zealand, there are still approximately 40 commercial blade shearers who work between July and October each year. Between these shearers, 400,000 sheep are shorn each year in New Zealand, mostly in Otago and the Canterbury high country. Blade shearers in New Zealand usually travel to sheds in groups of 5 or 6 shearers and usually live on the station during shearing. Often they will stay on the station for up to a week shearing around 1000 sheep per day. Most of the sheep that are blade shorn in New Zealand are fine wooled Merino. left The main reason sheep are still blade shorn in New Zealand is due to the harsh climate at the time of shearing. Blade shearing leaves a thicker cover of wool on the sheep after shearing giving it more protection from storms and also the wool grows back faster after blade shearing than machine shearing.  South Africa  Around 17 million of the 29 million sheep in South Africa are still blade shorn today. Because shearers' wages are comparatively very low, equipment costs matter more--and a blade shearer's equipment costs around R2,000 compared to a shearing machine at around R15,000.  Australia  Most of the blade shearing in Australia is on stud farms, ewes and rams in order to leave more wool on the sheep or a more natural finish. Some farmers will also trim or shape their sheep using blade shears for showing at competitions.  The United Kingdom  In The United Kingdom there is still a small number of sheep blade shorn each year. Most of the sheep shorn are in Scotland or in rougher parts of the country where sheep have either been mustered late or they do not have the resources for machine shearing. Many people still also use blade shears for trimming or dagging their sheep. There are a lot of people in the UK who know how to blade shear but most would shear only a few sheep per year.  South America  There is still some blade shearing in South America for Alpaca, Llama and sheep. Blade shearing is used for sheep in parts of Patagonia where the weather can be very harsh and so the extra cover of wool left by blade shears is preferable. Sport left In blade shearing competitions, the competitors are not only judged on how fast they can shear but also how tidily they shear. International blade shearing rules stipulate that the sheep must have an even finish of 5-15mm of wool and shearers will be penalised for any skin cuts or any wool that is too short or too long. Shearers are also judged as they shear for any time they cut the wool twice, this is called a second cut. Shearers can also be penalized for rough handling of the sheep or allowing the sheep to escape their control during shearing. Blade shearing as a sport has been through some ups and downs since the 1980s but in the last 2 or three years, it has increased in popularity. In the last 30 years many blade shearing competitions have been discontinued but now, with a resurgence of interest, the number of blade shearing competitions seems to be increasing. There were only 3 blade shearing competitions in Australia 25 years ago but that number has recently increased to at least 14 this year. In the UK this year a show was created specifically for blade shearing and to promote the blade shearing circuit in the UK. This month (October 2016) the Boort show held a blade shearing competition with $3000 for first place, the largest prize for a blade shearing event in the world. Blade shearers competing at The Waimate spring shearsThe next big blade shearing competition is the world shearing championships in Scotland, June 2022. Blade shearers from at least 13 countries will be competing including Australia, South Africa, Japan, USA, France, Germany, Ireland, England and more. For the last 20 years, South Africa and Lesotho have dominated the world blade shearing championships. The most recent world champion is Allan Oldfield from New Zealand who won the title at Le Dorat in France in July 2019. Styles Most commercial blade shearers in New Zealand and South Africa use a similar style of shearing to the traditional Bowen method used in machine shearing. The main differences are that in blade shearing the shearer takes less wool on the first leg of the sheep and they shear around the body of the sheep more than along the sheep. In Australia Blade shearers usually shear around the sheep even more to leave a smoother finish. They even shear around the backbone instead of along it. This method is especially useful for when you are trying to leave a longer staple of wool on or on very skinny sheep with a high shoulder. In several countries, they will tie up the sheep for shearing, this means that it is much easier to hold the sheep during shearing and means it cannot escape. This method is ok for less experienced shearers but is much slower so isn't suited for large mobs. There is a competition for this style of shearing at the Royal Welsh show each year  References  Category:Sheep shearing ","title":"Blade shearing"},{"id":"52065627","text":"Augustin Fliche (19 November 1884, Montpellier – 19 November 1951) was a 20th- century French historian who mainly dealt with the history of the Church in the Middle Ages.

In 1941, he was elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. He was opposed to both the educational theories of Marc Bloch and Bloch personally, probably, suggests Eugen Weber, due to Fliche's innate antisemitism and the fact that Bloch had once given one of Fliche's pieces a poor review.

Unranked and 4–7 Pitt, a 28½ point underdog, pulled the upset over archrival WVU who, coming into the game, was ranked second in the BCS and AP Poll and first in the Coaches' Poll. By upsetting West Virginia in the Mountaineers' regular season and home finale, the Panthers knocked WVU out of what had been assured to be their first appearance in a BCS National Championship Game and a shot at their first ever National Championship. The game was one of the most important Backyard Brawls in the series history, one of the biggest upsets in both Pittsburgh and West Virginia history, one of the biggest upsets of the season, and was voted as the \\"Game of the Year\\" by ESPNU. Game summary The Mountaineers could never get their high-powered offense going against the Panthers and were hurt by fumbles, missed field goals, and an injury to star quarterback Pat White, who missed most of the game after dislocating his thumb in the second quarter. Trailing by one possession late in the fourth quarter, West Virginia twice had the ball in Pitt territory. White had just returned but both times failed to convert on fourth down plays. The final Pitt possession saw the underdogs run the ball out of the back of the end zone for an intentional safety as time expired. West Virginia's kicker Pat McAfee missed two field goals in the game and Pitt's kicker Conor Lee missed one. ScoringSecond quarter= *WVU – Jarrett Brown 6 Yd Run (Pat McAfee kick) WVU 7–0 *PITT – Conor Lee 48 Yd field goal WVU 7–3 =Third quarter= *PITT – Pat Bostick 1 Yd Run (Conor Lee kick) PITT 10–7 =Fourth quarter= *PITT – Conor Lee 18 Yd field goal PITT 13–7 *WVU – Ball Through End Zone PITT 13–9 Aftermath The outcome of the game was met with stunned silence from Mountaineer fans while a large number of Pittsburgh fans in attendance were cheering in similar shock. At Pitt's campus in Pittsburgh, large numbers of students began forming in different locations of the Oakland neighborhood. In addition to the crowds a sofa chair was burned in front of the university's Cathedral of Learning, mocking the WVU tradition of burning couches after big wins. When interviewed in 2017 for an SB Nation 10-year retrospective on the 2007 college football season as a whole, Owen Schmitt, fullback for the 2007 WVU team, apparently still had problems coming to grips with the result, telling the reporter, \\"And then you get to the f***ing last game of the season and blow it against the s***tiest f***ing team in the f***ing world.\\" Several football recruits that were visiting West Virginia for the game ended up cheering with the Panthers on their sideline by the end of the game. Several of them later decided to play for Pitt over West Virginia. The game was briefly seen as a turning point in Coach Dave Wannstedt's early tenure at Pitt, during which he had struggled and seemingly stagnated. However, Wannstedt was later fired following the 2010 regular season. The trickle-down effect of West Virginia being knocked out of the BCS Championship has been speculated to have had a major impact on the bowl placement of many teams and the filling of various head-coaching positions. Most prominently affected was LSU, who slid into WVU's slot and ended up winning the BCS Championship. The game turned out to have a profound impact on the future of Michigan, which was in the midst of a search to replace retiring coach Lloyd Carr. Two weeks after the loss, Michigan hired Mountaineers coach Rich Rodriguez as Carr's successor. Had West Virginia beaten Pitt, Rodriguez likely would not have left West Virginia and passed up the chance to play for a BCS National Championship, and Michigan would have had to look elsewhere for its coach. The game was named as the \\"Game of the Year\\" by ESPNU and other publications. It was also the first time the Panthers defeated a 2nd-ranked opponent since their 24–20 win over Georgia in the 1982 Sugar Bowl. West Virginia's season ended on a positive note, however, as it was elected to play in the Fiesta Bowl against the Oklahoma Sooners. The Mountaineers avenged their devastating loss to Pitt with a convincing 48–28 win over the 3rd-ranked Sooners. The teams met again the next season in Pittsburgh, as was usual as the rivalry was an annual one at the time, and the Mountaineers came into Pittsburgh hungry for revenge. However, Pittsburgh won 19-15, and the teams ended with identical 9-4 records. In 2009, the teams met in Morgantown for the first time since the upset. This time, West Virginia won 19-16. They met 2 more times in 2010 and 2011, and the Mountaineers won each of them. With the Panther's departure to the ACC in 2012, and the Mountaineers departure to the Big 12 that same year, the series was in doubt, and they haven't met since 2011. In 2015, the two schools agreed to play a 4-game series from 2022-25. The Mountaineers' loss assured that the 2007 college football season would finish with no teams undefeated, making it the first time since 2003 that such a thing had occurred. Along with #1 Missouri's loss in the Big 12 Championship Game to Oklahoma, West Virginia's loss to Pitt represented the second straight week that both the #1 and #2 teams lost. It was the first time it had happened in consecutive weekends. As a result, Ohio State, who was idle the last 2 weeks, and LSU, who won the SEC Championship Game over Tennessee, were selected to play in the BCS National Championship Game, with the Tigers winning 38-24.

Stolbrand (May 13, 1821 – February 3, 1894), was a sergeant in the Swedish artillery who emigrated to the United States, becoming a brigadier general in the Union Army during the Civil War, and a politician in South Carolina after the war. Early life Stolbrand was born as one of nine illegitimate children of Adolf Fredrik Tornérhjelm, a nobleman and manor owner, with his mistress Christina Möller, a chambermaid at the manor. At the age of 18, in 1839, Stolbrand enlisted in the Royal Wendish Artillery, at the same time changing his family name from Möller, to Ståhlbrand. In 1850 he resigned from the Swedish army, and emigrated to the United States with his wife and a three-year-old son.Olsson & Wikén 1995, p. 435-436.Scheutz 2004, p. 75. Stolbrand first settled in New York City in 1852 and then eventually made his way to Chicago with his family, earning his livelihood as a land surveyor, and clerk in the Cook County Recorder's Office. He participated actively in the city's political and social life, being one of the founders of the Svea Society, a middle class Swedish-American secular association, serving as its president for several years.Meijer & al. 1904–1926, vol. 27, p. 553.Olson 1917, p. 105, 175.Beijbom 1971, p. 281. Civil War At the beginning of the Civil War, Stolbrand raised a volunteer artillery company, but it was not accepted into service, as Illinois' quota already had been filled. However, when a new call for troops came, he raised another artillery company that, later in 1861, became Battery G, 2nd Illinois Light Artillery, with himself as captain. After about a month's service, Stolbrand was promoted to major.Olson 1917, p. 105.Heitman 1903, vol. 1, p. 928.Barnickel 1998, p. 60. He served in the Army of the Tennessee, as Chief of Artillery, Third Division, XVII Corps, and as Chief of Artillery, XVII Corps, in both instances under John A. Logan as commander of the division and the corps.Welcher 1998, vol. 1, p. 1007; vol. 2, pp. 257, 304, 873, 875, 881, 892, 902. Stolbrand became a prisoner of war in September 1864, incarcerated in Columbia, South Carolina, but exchanged within a monthOlson 1917, p. 106. In 1865, he was promoted to brigadier general, becoming commander of Second Brigade, Fourth Division, XVII Army Corps.Welcher 1998, vol. 2, pp. 312-313. Colonel Hans Mattson tells us in his memoirs, that it was General Sherman himself who arranged with President Lincoln to have Stolbrand promoted, since he otherwise would have resigned.Mattson 1890, p. 111. South Carolina After the war, Stolbrand settled in Beaufort, South Carolina where he had a plantation. He became active in Republican politics; was secretary of the state constitutional convention of 1868, a delegate to the Republican National Convention, and a presidential elector the same year. Stolbrand was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1868, but resigned in 1869, when he were appointed superintendent of the state penitentiary, an office he held until 1873. He was later accused by the anti-Reconstruction elements in the legislature, of embezzlement while in office. In 1876 he became superintendent of construction of the customs house in Charleston, an office he held until the building was finished the following year. In 1880 Stolbrand was appointed federal storekeeper and gauger, and also ran and lost against D. Wyatt Aiken in the congressional elections of that year. During President Harrison's administration he was superintendent of federal buildings in Charleston.Reynolds 1905, pp. 79, 102, 107, 489.Olson 1917, p. 108.Mancini 1996, p. 204. Personal life Stolbrand married Maria Sophia Petersson, the daughter of a sergeant-major in the same regiment as his. The couple had three children in Sweden, but two died before their departure for America. In their adopted country, they had another four children; three daughters and a son. The son eventually served six years as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army. In 1894, Stolbrand contracted influenza which resulted in a collapsed lung; he died as a result.Welsh 1996, p. 322.

First Indian Space Sci-fi Film is Kalai Arasi (1963) MGR Movie. Plot The DSD team which has Mahendran (Jayaprakash) at its helm find that an asteroid will hit earth in seven days. Lives of four crore people in and around Chennai are at stake. The only way to destroy the asteroid would be with a heavy missile. But seeing as how there’s less time, there’s only one way to obtain the missile, through illegal means. The team goes ahead with this secret mission with only the Prime Minister, Home Minister and Defence Minister in on it. The biggest challenge now is to take it to space, which will only be possible by expert thieves. An escape artist Vasu (Jayam Ravi) and his friends Venkat (Ramesh Thilak) and Appu (Arjunan) are roped in. Joining them are DSD members Swathi (Nivetha Pethuraj) and Raguram (Vincent Asokan). After training, they board the spacecraft Dhruva 1. Before launch, Vasu hears a mysterious voice on the voice channel in his communication device. The voice tells him that Ravi, Vasu's son, has been kidnapped by him. In order to release him, Vasu must do whatever the voice tells him to. Dhruva 1 has a successful launch. En Route to the space station, the voice tells Vasu to cut some wires, which would cause a fuel leak. He feigns unconsciousness before proceeding to cut the wires. Venkat questions why he is doing it, to which he reveals Ravi's kidnapping. This causes Dhruva 1 to spiral out of control and crash land on the moon. The crew steps out to do repairs to the ship, where they find the wires cut. The ship is repaired, but the ship has little fuel. Vasu suggests refueling from the spacestation they are headed to, that way they would have an excuse to enter the station. They agree to that plan and request permission to refuel from the space station to which the crew on board the spacestation approve. Dhruva 1 then leaves the moon, bound for the spacestation. However, images of Vasu cutting the wires, are discovered by Lt. Gen. T. Rithika (Rethika Srinivas) and brought to Mahendran's attention. Mahendran does not pursue the matter further. Meanwhile, Dhruva 1 successfully docks at the spacestation, but the crew are arrested by the crew members, under Captain Li Wei (Aaron Aziz). It is revealed that the crew of the station, know the true intentions behind Dhruva 1's mission. They intend to hold them off, so that the astroid will hit the bay of Bengal, destroying India, whilst profiting their country, by the major rebuilding projects needed. While in the spacestation, Venkat and Appu hack the space station, causing a power outage, while Vasu obtains Captain Li Wei's fingerprint and iris in order to enter the chamber with the missile. Vasu manages to make the missile disappear without the alarm system triggering. Captain Li Wei realises this, and interrogates them, assaulting the crew physically. Vasu says that the missile is in Dhruva 1, but when some of the crew follow Vasu, he kills them on the ship. He conveys a message through Swathi that the missile is pointed at the capital of the country owning the missile, and that he will launch the missile at the city if the crew of Dhruva 1 is not released. Dhruva 1's crew are released and proceed to the ship, while Vasu goes in the chamber holding the missile, where it is revealed that the missile was there the whole time. He steals the missile and exits the ship through space, but hits a piece of the station, puncturing his spacesuit. This causes the oxygen tank to leak. But, he successfully manages to get the missile to Dhruva 1. The ship departs from the spacestation, and Vasu is revived. Meanwhile, Dhruva 2 arrives to refuel Dhruva 1. It is now known why the wires had to be cut, in order for Dhruva 2 to be mobilised. While the mysterious voice instructs Vasu to hand over the missile to the crew of Dhruva 2, Rithika hears this from Mahendran's communication device. She goes to his office, where Mahendran kills her, revealing that he is the mysterious voice and that he wants to sell the missile on the black market. Meanwhile, Dhruva 1 successfully refuels and heads to the astroid to fire the missile, where the crew realised that the missile is missing. Meanwhile, Ravi is released. Mahendran shows the images of Vasu sabotaging the ship and says that Vasu was the cause of this. The crew then realized that they've failed, and that India will be destroyed. However, they then reveal that the missile is still on board the spacecraft, and is ready to be fired. It is revealed,that Vasu had notified Swathi and Raguram about the mysterious voice, and that he gave a decoy of the missile to Dhruva 2. The systems on the ship were hacked to reflect the astroid passing a safety line when it had not. The missile is fired, and the astroid is split into half, avoiding the earth. However Dhruva 1 is hit by debris, and is about to explode. The crew evacuate the ship in time and reach earth. On earth, Ravi reveals the truth about Mahendran as Ravi had grabbed a gold chain belonging to him. Days later, Mahendran presents medals to the Dhruva 1 crew, where Vasu reveals that the whole crew knows about Mahendran. He then proceeds to kill himself backstage while Vasu, Appu and Venkat walk away. Cast * Jayam Ravi as M.

The primary goal is the design and construction of a 4m-class optical telescope and other smaller observing facilities to respond to a growing demand. INO is executed at the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), one of the leading research institutes in fundamental sciences.  Background  The current research and training capabilities in observational astronomy in Iran is unable to meet the growing demand due to a rapid growth in higher education over the past two decades. While almost every big university in Iran has an astronomy department or group, the existing observational facilities consist of a number of small telescopes in various university campus observatories generally used for undergraduate and graduate training. A medium-size optical telescope is thought to be a step to facilitate research in astronomy and observational cosmology. The geographic location of Iran, 32N 53E, relatively dry climate, and high altitude mountains, offer suitable locations for optical telescopes to carry out surveys and time critical observations. At the present, the flagship of the INO observing facilities is a 3.4m optical telescope under construction, known as INO340. Iranian scientists see the project as a platform to catch up with the science and technological developments in the field of astronomy and cosmology.  Site selection  The site selection activities began in 2000 before the formal approval of the project in 2004. Over 30 sites have been visited and seeing observations were conducted in some of them. Later 4 sites were chosen for simultaneous seeing monitoring for 2 yearsSite selection for the 3.4 m optical telescope of the Iranian National Observatory. With two sites in hand after the conclusion of the site selection (2000–2007) INO made seeing measurements to be able to compare the two sites, Dinava ~3000m and Gargash ~3610m. In 2011, INO announced Mount Gargash as the site for this project. The site became road accessible in 2016.http://ino.org.ir/en/?p=226.  Telescope design  Optics The telescope is a Ritchey–Chrétien f/11 which provides unvignetted 20 arcmin field of view at the main Cassegrain focus. In addition, 3 broken side foci are also provided, each with a field of view of 8 arcmin. The main mirror (M1) is a single segment fast f/1.5 mirror with a diameter of 3.4m, which makes INO340 one of the most compact telescopes for its size. M1 is a meniscus shape 18cm thick made of a Zerudor ceramic with a 700mm central hole. The M1 is polished to 1nm roughness. It is supported by 60 actuators which are actively controlled to hold the mirror shape at the correct shape. The 600mm secondary mirror reflects the light from the primary mirror and is also controlled by a hexapod. The mirror is made of a Zerodur ceramic and has a hyperbolic surface geometry. The structure The telescope mount is altitude over azimuth (alt-az) which allows the telescope to be compact and provides direct load paths from the telescope down through the structure to the pier and foundations. The drive motors used to move the telescope in azimuth and elevation will be servo motors with position feedback will be provided by linear tape encoders. Telescope Control System (TCS) The TCS is responsible for controlling a number of subsystems, such as the mount control system (MCS) which is responsible for pointing and tracking the targets and the mirrors control system or active control systems (ACS). MCS receives commands from the user interface. Telescope enclosure and the dome The telescope enclosure is a cylindrical structure composed of a concrete ring of 16m in diameter at centre of which a 6m dimeter telescope pier is located. On top of the concrete building there is a rotating cylindrical structure of approx 200 tons with a 5m shutter to facilitate the exposure of the primary mirror to the light from the dark night objects and 5 windows to allow air flow inside the dome. The dome and a lower floor are chilled during the day to reduce the mirror seeing.  Observational facilities  INO site monitoring The INO site monitoring facility become operational in Nov 2014. The facility is located at about 500 m to the south of the main Gargash peak where the 3.4 m Telescope is under construction. The facility consists of three elements. First, an automatic DIMM seeing monitor placed at a height of 6m above the surface of the mountain, remotely operated from Tehran. Secondly the facility has a standard weather station at 9m above the ground. and finally, it is equipped with an all-sky camera. The control system is designed in-house. Live site data is available here. INO Lens Array The INO Lens Array (INOLA) is a multi-lens array constructed by the INO Technology Development Division (TDD) team to study ultra-low surface brightness systems at visible wavelengths. The array is particularly designed to reveal faint structures by greatly reducing scattered light and internal reflections within its optics. Some of the scientific goals envisioned for the INOLA include observing faint galaxies, stellar halos and substructures, tidal debris around galaxies, comets and minor bodies in the solar system, light echos, intra-cluster light, variable stars and exoplanetary transits. INOLA became operational in 2018 and is now open for proposals. To obtain more information about the facility visit here.  Science with INO  A vast amount of scientific issues in observational astronomy and cosmology can be addressed using a medium class telescope such as INO 3.4m telescope. At the same time, as it is designed for a wavelength interval limited to between 325 and 2500 nm, INO340 is an excellent tool for collaborative programs joining other, major, similar size and/or larger telescopes as well as with space- based telescopes optimized to work at similar or different, not least very different, wavelength ranges. The study of galaxies and our current understanding of the formation and evolution of the large and small scale structures are, to a large extent, based on the observations carried out by mid-size telescopes. Even at the era of large and very large telescopes, such observations are still pursued thanks to advances in the instrumentation. While there are new frontiers to be explored by very large and extremely large telescopes, there are still enormous details which require further explorations. For economic and flexibility reasons there are still demands for 2‐4m class telescopes. These telescopes can complement other observing facilities to address some of the most fundamental questions related to galaxies such as the evolution of the cosmic web of galaxies, metal production and distribution within and between galaxies, the formation of the present-day Hubble sequence and also understanding our own galaxy. For the community of astronomers in Iran, extra-galactic astronomy and observational cosmology are new undertakings mostly because of the absence of suitable observing facilities in the past and thus INO340 will focus on this line of developing research. Taking advantage of the location, INO340 is designed to respond to time-critical astronomical events. Large programs and surveys are also pursued in instrumentation planning. The INO run a training program in collaboration with the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING)Isaac Newton Telescope. One of the science programs produced the first 3D map of the Local Bubble Local Bubble.3D map of Local Bubble using DIBs  See also  * Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences References External links  * Iranian National Observatory (INO) Homepage * Institute for Research in Fundamental Science (IPM) Homepage Category:Astronomical observatories in Iran ","title":"Iranian National Observatory"},{"id":"52065695","text":"Oscar Martinez Salan (born 21 August 1996) is a Spanish male badminton player.

Inspiration and development In 1970, Morgan had a marriage crisis after about six years, when she became dissatisfied with herself and her husband. The failure of the marriage was possible. She realized for herself that she could not change her husband, which is why she had to change herself. Contrary to her own original desires, she found the solution to her problems in absolute allegiance to her husband, which also included sexual surrender. In the same year, she founded Total Woman, Inc., a company that was concerned with marketing this idea. From then on, she gave seminars for Christian-oriented married women about how they should conduct themselves in deference towards their husbands. The seminars consisted of four two-hour sessions for $15. After several years, she had trained more than 100 instructors, who gave further courses in 28 states and Canada. By 1975, there were over 15,000 graduates, including the singer Anita Bryant, the wives of Jack Nicklaus and Joe Frazier, and 12 wives of players from the Miami Dolphins football team. Morgan wrote her four basic ideas—ignoring the mistakes of the husband and focusing on his virtues, admiring him physically, appreciating him, and adapting to the idea that the husband was the king and his wife was the queen—down in a book, The Total Woman. It was published in December 1973 by the small publishing house Fleming H. Revell Company, a subsidiary of the evangelically-oriented Baker Publishing Group. The first printing was 5,000 copies. The book sold over 500,000 copies within the first year, making it the best-selling non-fiction book in the USA in 1974. The paperback rights were sold for over $600,000.

History  The Sultanate of Oman recognized Bangladesh in 1974. Bangladesh established her diplomatic mission in Oman in March 1983. Since then the two countries have been maintaining cordial relations. Oman was one of the first Arab countries to extend support to Bangladesh's membership at the UN and other international organizations. Bangladesh upgraded its mission in Oman in 1996 at the level of Ambassador. The Sultanate of Oman established its full-fledged embassy in Dhaka in 2012. Bangladesh has a resident embassy in Oman. Bangladeshi employees fall under the Kafala system, which bounds them to their employers and according to Human Rights Watch it leaves them vulnerable to abuse. In 2013, some 1,34,028 Bangladeshi workers entered into Oman with different categories of work permits and the Mission remains vigilant in facilitating the process. In 2014, 1,05,748 Bangladeshis came to Oman on different categories of visas. Approximately US$700 million has been remitted by Bangladeshi expatriates living in Oman during the FY July 2013-June 2014. Diplomatic Visits * Dipu Moni, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh paid an official visit to Oman from 25–26 April 2012. She met with Omani Foreign Minister H.E. Mr. Yousuf Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah, Inspector General of Police and Customs, Mr. Hassan bin Mohseen Al Sheraiqi, Minister of Commerce & Industry H.E. Engineer Ali bin Masood Al Sunaidi, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Dr. Fuad bin Jafer Al Sagwani and Minister of Oil and Gas Dr. Mohammed Bin Hamad bin Saif Al Rumhi. The first ever bilateral official visit by any Foreign Minister from either side infused much needed momentum in our bilateral relations.

The name of the brigade was chosen to commemorate the twelve Battles of the Isonzo during World War I.  Activation  In 1975 the Italian Army undertook a major reorganization of its forces: the regimental level was abolished and battalions came under direct command of multi-arms brigades. As tensions with Yugoslavia over the city if Trieste were allayed by the Treaty of Osimo and because of a reduction of military service from 15 to 12 months for army and air force and from 24 to 18 months for the navy, forced the army to reduce its forces by nearly 45,000 troops, it was decided that the units of the Infantry Division \\"Mantova\\" would contract to a single brigade. Therefore most units of the Mantova were disbanded and on 21 October 1975 the remaining units of the division were used to raise the Mechanized Brigade \\"Isonzo\\" in Cividale del Friuli. The brigade's command was created by reorganizing and renaming the command of the 76th Infantry Regiment \\"Napoli\\" in Cividale del Friuli.

The game was developed by Evil Mojo, an internal studio of Hi-Rez and was released on May 8, 2018 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, followed by a Nintendo Switch version released on June 12, 2018. Setting Paladins takes place in a sci-fi fantasy world. There are elements of both fantasy and science fiction, including medieval-looking soldiers who use ranged weapons such as shotguns and assault rifles instead of swords. In the world of Paladins, there is a conflict between two factions; the Magistrate and the Paladins. Champions were recruited in order to minimize casualties of regular foot soldiers. The champions would be considered \\"special forces\\" as they are more efficient at combat than a regular soldier. Not all champions are committed, however. There were a few who did not pick sides during the war, rather they would contract with both, rendering them mercenaries. The rest of these special forces were committed to a faction, either the Magistrate or the Paladins/Resistance. There are also minor factions in the game as well, the \\"Abyss\\", the \\"Thousand Hands\\" and the \\"Pyre\\". Gameplay Paladins provides various characters, called Champions, for the players to choose during their gaming sessions. Each of these Champions falls into one of the following categories: Front Line, Damage, Support, and Flank. Being a team-based shooter, players must rely on strategy, character knowledge, coordination, and teamwork in order to attain victory. Players may use VGS, along with text and voice chat to communicate. A good team will have a balanced choice of classes that will support each other during the game. Game modes There are different gameplay modes for Paladins: *Siege: The 'main' Paladins game mode, two teams of 5 race against each other to capture the map's central capture point and, if successful, push a payload that spawns from it to the enemy base. Each successful push or capture grants one point. Preventing the enemy team from pushing the payload also grants one point. Additionally, the team that captures the point will get a bonus of 300 credits. The first team to score four points wins the game. A team cannot score their fourth point on defense, however, meaning that the team must capture a point or push the payload to win. *Onslaught: Teams battle over a large combat area in an attempt to take point control and earn points. Along with holding an uncontested presence on the control point, slaying enemy players also scores points for the team, akin to a team deathmatch. *Team Deathmatch: A classic game mode in most first-person shooter games, where two teams fight against each other to score kills. The first team to score 40 kills wins the game. *Ranked: The same game mode as Siege, however when players are choosing a champion, each team can pick two champions to ban, which makes them unavailable for either team. Also, each team can see the opponent's champions that are picked and selected, and once a champion is picked by any player on a team, the other team cannot use that same champion. Paladins Strike Paladins Strike is the mobile version of the game, launched in May 2018.https://segmentnext.com/2018/05/15/paladins-strike-guide/ Reception The PC version of Paladins received generally favorable reviews, while the Nintendo Switch version received mixed or average reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. In response to accusations that the game is an Overwatch clone, Hi-Rez COO Todd Harris said that \\"Overwatch was not the inspiration for Paladins\\", and \\"the game that deserves the most credit is Team Fortress 2\\".

Career Rallis received a B.A. in 1964 from Harvard University, a Ph.D. in 1968 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and spent 1968–1970 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. After two years at Stony Brook, two years at Universite de Strasbourg, and several visiting positions, he joined the faculty at Ohio State University in 1977 and stayed there for the rest of his career. Work Beginning in the 1970s, Rallis and Gérard Schiffmann wrote a series of papers on the Weil representation. This led to Rallis's work with Kudla in which they developed a far-reaching generalization of the Siegel–Weil formula: the regularized Siegel–Weil formula and the first term identity.W.T. Gan, Y. Qiu, and S. Takeda (2014)\\"The Regularized Siegel–Weil Formula (The Second Term Identity) and the Rallis Inner Product Formula,\\" Inventiones Math. 198, 739–831 These results have prompted other mathematicians to extend Siegel–Weil to other cases.J.

Rallis then adapted the classical idea of doubling a quadratic space to create the \\"Piatetski–Shapiro and Rallis Doubling Method\\" for constructing integral representations of L-functions, and thus they obtained the first general result on L-functions for all classical groups.J.

Whereas it had previously been assumed that all the L-functions constructed by the Rankin–Selberg integral method were a subset of those constructed by the Langlands–Shahidi method, the 1992 paper by Rallis with Piatetski-Shapiro and Schiffmann on the Rankin–Selberg integrals for the group G_2 showed this was not the case and opened the way for determining many new examples of L-functions represented by Rankin–Selberg integrals.D.

Rallis with David Soudry and David Ginzburg wrote a series of papers culminating in their book \\"The descent map from automorphic representations of GL(n) to classical groups\\". Their automorphic descent method constructs an explicit inverse map to the (standard) Langlands functorial lift and has had major applications to the analysis of functoriality.J. Cogdell, H.

He showed high-class form as a two-year- old in 2008, winning his first three races including the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot and then finishing second in a strong renewal of the Phoenix Stakes. In 2009 he was well-beaten on his seasonal debut before defeating a top-class international field in the Golden Jubilee Stakes at odds of 20/1. He failed to reproduce anything approaching his Ascot form in four subsequent starts and was retired from racing at the end of the year. He has had little success as a breeding stallion. Background Art Connoisseur is a bay horse with a small white star bred in Ireland by Denis McDonnell. He was the best horse sired by Lucky Story. a top-class racehorse who won the Richmond Stakes and the Champagne Stakes as well as finishing second in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Art Connoisseur's dam Withorwithouyou showed modest ability as a racehorse, winning one minor race at Warwick Racecourse in twelve starts. She was a granddaughter of Morning Has Broken, the female-line ancestor of Balanchine and West Wind (Prix de Diane). In October, the yearling was consigned by Parkway Farm to the Tattersalls sales and was bought for 55,000 guineas by the bloodstock agents Kern, Lillingston Associates. Art Connoisseur entered the ownership of Richard Green and was sent into training with Michael Bell at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career=2008: two-year-old season Art Connoisseur was ridden in all of his races as a two-year-old by Jamie Spencer. On his racecourse debut he started 100/30 second favourite for a five furlong maiden race at Leicester Racecourse on 3 April. After racing in second place he took the lead approaching the final furlong and went clear of his five rivals to win by three and a quarter lengths. Two weeks later the colt started 11/10 favourite for a minor race over the same distance at Newmarket Racecourse. He took the lead a furlong out and won by two and a quarter lengths from Servoca and ten others, although, as on his debut, he hung to the right in the closing stages. On 17 June Art Connoisseur was moved up in class and distance for the Group Two Coventry Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot. The Mick Channon-trained Orizaba ahead of Himalya with Art Connoisseur the 8/1 third choice in an eighteen-runner field. After being restrained towards the rear of the field he made rapid progress in the last quarter mile and took the lead inside the final furlong. Despite hanging right yet again he was \\"soon in full control\\" and won by two and a quarter lengths and a short head from Intense Focus and Lord Shanakill (later to win the Prix Jean Prat). In July he was sent to Ireland for the Group One Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh and started favourite against four Irish-trained runners. He stayed on from the rear of the field but sustained his first defeat as he was beaten into second place by Mastercraftsman with Bushranger (later to win the Prix Morny and the Middle Park Stakes) in third. In August the colt started second favourite for the rescheduled Gimcrack Stakes which was run at Newbury Racecourse after the York meeting was abandoned. He tracked the leaders before fading in the last quarter mile and finished eighth of the twelve runners behind Shaweel. He sustained a minor crack to his cannon bone in the race and missed the rest of the season. 2009: three-year-old season On his three- year-old debut, Art Connoisseur was assigned top weight of 131 pounds in the European Free Handicap over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 15 April. Ridden by Spencer he pulled hard in the early stages but after struggling to obtain a clear run he was eased down in the closing stages and finished seventh behind Ouqba. In May Art Connoisseur's training was interrupted by a minor leg injury. His exercise over the next month involved two weeks of swimming followed by two weeks of canters before returning to full training in June. Tom Queally took over from the suspended Jamie Spencer when Art Connoisseur was matched against older horses for the first time and started a 20/1 outsider for the Group One Golden Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot on 20 June. The race attracted a strong international challenge including the favourite J J the Jet Plane (Al Quoz Sprint) from South Africa, Sacred Kingdom from Hong Kong, Cannonball from the United States, Ialysos from Greece, Bushranger from Ireland and the former American sprinter Diabolical (Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap), now representing Godolphin. The British challengers included Kingsgate Native, King's Apostle (Diadem Stakes) and Regal Parade (Ayr Gold Cup). Queally restrained his mount as J J the Jet Plane set the pace before giving way to the outsider Lesson In Humility two furlongs out. Art Connoisseur was switched left to race up the stands-side rail, overtook Lesson In Humility a furlong from the finish and held off the late challenge of Cannonball to win by a length. After the race Michael Bell said \\"It's such a thrill because we turned down telephone numbers for him and now it looks the right decision. I was slightly regretting it over the winter.\\" Queally commented \\"It's great to be on board and the horse did it very well. I just gave him time, got a split and it was do or die then up the rails. He idles in his work and only does as much as he has to, but I gave him a couple of cracks and he knuckled down great\\". The rest of Art Connoisseur's racing career was a complete disappointment: in four races he failed to finish in the first ten and never finished within nine lengths of the winner. He finished twelfth of thirteen behind Fleeting Spirit in the July Cup, fifteenth behind Borderlescott in the Nunthorpe Stakes (when his saddle slipped) and twelfth behind Regal Parade in the Haydock Sprint Cup. On his final appearance, he finished eleventh of the fourteen runners behind Sayif in the Diadem Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 27 September. Stud career Art Connoisseur was retired from racing at the end of his three-year-old season and became a breeding stallion at the Irish National Stud with an initial stud fee of €7,000. In December 2014 the eight-year-old stallion was auctioned at Tattersalls and bought for 40,000 guineas by Oliver St Lawrence Bloodstock. He has several minor winners but no top-class performers: the best of his offspring has probably been Suzi's Connoisseur, who won a Listed race in Germany.

It contains an area of almost untouched Amazon rainforest inhabited by communities that rely on manioc farming, small-scale animal husbandry, fishing, hunting and gathering. Location The Baixo Juruá Extractive Reserve is divided between the municipalities of Uarini (38.33%) and Juruá (61.67%) in Amazonas. It has an area of . The reserve is about from Manaus by boat. The reserve is mostly in the interfluvial region between the Juruá and the Uarini rivers. It is bounded by the Juruá on the west, the Andirá River to the south, the Copacá River, a tributary of the Uarini, on the east and the Arapapá stream, a tributary of the Juruá, to the north. The Juruá and Uarini rivers flow north from the reserve, passing on either side of the Kumaru do Lago Ualá Indigenous Territory, to join the Solimões River. The south of the reserve adjoins the Tefé National Forest. History The Baixo Juruá Extractive Reserve was created by federal decree on 1 August 2001 with the objectives of ensuring sustainable use and conservation of renewable natural resources, protecting the livelihood and culture of the local extractive population. It is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). It became part of the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, established in 2002. The reserve is managed by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. The deliberative council was created on 4 November 2008. The participative management plan was approved on 16 November 2009. As of 2016 the reserve was supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Environment Altitudes range from above sea level. Average daily temperatures range from with an average of . Annual rainfall is . Soils are generally poor apart from areas that receive deposits of nutrients from the mineral-rich Juruá River flood waters. The reserve is almost completely covered by dense tropical forest, with only about 0.6% cleared for fields by the residents. Forests coverage includes flooded and terra firma alluvial Amazon rainforest ecosystems. The rich forest remains largely untouched. There are abundant fish. Economy The reserve is home to several communities, some very isolated and traditional with strong elements of the local indigenous people, and some more influenced by the external world. Most of the communities are on the banks of the Juruá or the banks of streams or lakes. The staple food is manioc flour, enhanced by hunting wild animals and gathering fruits, roots and leaves of the forest plants. Many communities also keep chickens, ducks, pigs and cattle. There is perceived ongoing degradation to some environments due to overfishing of some species and excessive capture of turtles and other wildlife. IBAMA/Tefé is unable to provide enough competent professionals to handle these issues in the large and inaccessible reserve.

The Azores–Gibraltar Transform Fault is in the top right corner. The Fifteen- Twenty or 15°20' Fracture Zone (FTFZ), also known as the Cabo Verde Fracture Zone, is a fracture zone located on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) in the central Atlantic Ocean between 14–16°N. It is the current location of the migrating triple junction marking the boundaries between the North American, South American, and Nubian plates. The FTFZ is roughly parallel to the North and South America—Africa spreading direction and has a broad axial valley produced over the last ten million years by the northward-migrating triple junction. Offsetting the MAR by some 175 km, the FTFZ is located on one of the slowest portions of the MAR where the full spreading rate is 25 km/Myr. Geological setting North and south of the FTFZ the axis of the MAR is near-perpendicular to the spreading direction and the spreading rate is 2.6 mm/yr. The axial valley south of the FTFZ is composed of short axial volcanic ridges separated by 8–18 km-long en echelon deeps, while north of the FTFZ the axial ridges are much longer and more linear. North and south of the FTFZ the ocean floor is relatively smooth with long abyssal hills, probably detachment faults, aligned near-parallel to the ridge axis. In contrast, close to the FTFZ the terrain is more rugged and adorned with short, oblique fault scarps. Associated with the transition between these two types of terrains (at about 15°50'N and 14°30'N respectively) are V-shaped, south-propagating structures. These transitional structures disappear away from the ridge. Within the rugged terrain serpentinized peridotite and gabbro are capped with a thin layer of extrusive basalt. In the smooth areas the lithosphere is more magmatic in composition. The FTFZ is flanked by two negative gravity anomalies associated with the accretion of igneous crust. The anomaly south of the FTFZ is twice as large as the northern one. There are also geochemical variations across the fracture zone. On the southern side basalts are enriched MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) but on the northern side basalts change from enriched to depleted away from the FTFZ. Peridotites collected from south of the FTFZ have an uncommon composition ascribed to a H2O-rich or hot mantle source. Megamullions Corrugated surfaces known as megamullions or oceanic core complexes measure 25 km along-axis and 10–15 km across. When found along other mid-ocean ridges such structures occur at the inside corners of ridge discontinuities, but at the FTFZ they occur on both sides of the ridge away from any non-transform discontinuities. These structures and ultramafic rocks outcropping on either side of the MAR (in contrast to other parts of the ridge) indicate considerably reduced magma supply near the FTFZ. Paradoxically, geochemical analyses of basalts near the FTFZ instead suggest an enriched mantle source and the presence of a mantle hotspot. Two models can explain these contradictions. A westward ridge jump could relocate an older megamullion on the original western flank to the opposite flank after which a new megamullion start to form on the new western flank. Near the FTFZ this would place the older megamullion in an outside corner while the younger develop in an inside corner. Alternatively, an eastward ridge jump or migration could turn a west- dipping detachment fault into an east-dipping fault, which would also result in an older abandoned and a younger active megamullion. Which is the case is currently not known. Superimposed on the larger corrugated surfaces are two systems of smaller scale corrugations: one on a 1–3 km-scale, roughly 200 m high, and another finer about 100–500 m wide. The latter occur up to 1 km from the ridge and is covered by elevated ridges running parallel to the spreading direction, about 10 m wide, hundreds of metres long, and 10 m tall. These in turn are covered with cm-scale striations running in the same direction. Triple junction The North American–South American–African triple junction is associated with the initial opening of the Atlantic Ocean and has had a complex tectonic history. It probably migrated from near 10°N to its current location near the FTFZ between 72.5 and 35.5 Ma. Both its location and that of the North America–South-American–Caribbean triple junction are debated, however. The initiation and evolution of triple junctions is often associated with mantle plumes, but, if this is the case near the FTFZ, the limited supply of magma suggest an embryonic plume or a local, anomalous mantle composition. The relative movement between the North American and South American plates is very small, but the resulting deformation could possibly explain both off-axis seismicity and the odd mantle composition.

It is a fictional account of a real night, 25 February 1964. It pinpoints a pivotal moment in the lives of four, still nascent, black American icons whose potential, thoughts and actions play out in the 90 minute, one-act play. The scenario presents an audacious challenge - to cast 22 year old, newly crowned world boxing champion Cassius Clay as he transforms into Muhammad Ali, controversial Nation of Islam leader / mentor Malcolm X, influential singer-songwriter and record producer Sam Cooke and star NFL footballer Jim Brown. The men, friends in real life, celebrate Clay's surprise title win over Sonny Liston in a Miami hotel room, watched over by Nation of Islam security. World Premiere Kemp Powers won the Ted Schmitt Award for outstanding world premiere of a new play for One Night in Miami.LADCC Awards Turn Critical CTG The production took place in Los Angeles at Rogue Machine Theatre in June 2013, where Powers was a resident playwright.'One Night in Miami' with Malcolm X, Ali Brown, and Cooke It also won three LA Drama Critics Circle Awards, four NAACP Theatre Awards (best playwright, best director, best ensemble cast, best producer) and LA Weekly Theater Awards for playwriting and direction.https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-la- drama-critics-hand- out-2013-awards-20140318-story.htmlhttp://thetemblors.org/bio-powers.html The trailer for the world premiere at Rogue Machine Theatre includes cast, director Carl Cofield and playwright Kemp Powers. Powers explains how he wished to show the friends as men sharing very real, complex concerns, allowing a glimpse beyond their now mythic status. Cofield considers that the play offers a catalyst for audiences to go away and learn more about the truth of Jim Brown, Sam Cooke, Malcolm X and Cassius Clay. Reception The Hollywood Reporter described One Night in Miami as 'a well-drafted and intricate sketch, with an uncommon feeling for shading. It gives fine actors good material to play in a congenially theatrical mode' Variety commented, 'It's easy to see why investors are eyeing this crackerjack world premiere. Any playwright can stick celebrity facsimiles together in a room; it takes real talent not only to render those portraits believable but also to invest the encounter with dramatic weight' The LA Times wrote that 'the pull of history and considerable topicality sells One Night in Miami at Rogue Machine. Although this well -appointed dramedy about what might have gone down in the Hampton House hotel the night that Cassius Clay became world heavyweight champion slightly overdoes the 20/20 hindsight, that doesn’t stop it from grabbing our imaginations'LA Times /2013/jun/11one-night-in-miami-rogue- machine Cast and creatives * Director: Carl Cofield * Cast: Kevin Daniels, Jason Delane, Matt Jones, Ty Jones, Jason E.

The Donmar Warehouse website described the setting and background: \\"The world would come to know him as Muhammad Ali, but on 25 February 1964, 22-year old Cassius Clay was celebrating his world heavyweight title - not by hitting the town, but in a hotel room with his three closest friends: activist Malcolm X, singer Sam Cooke and American football star Jim Brown. To the outside world, they were American icons. But in that hotel room, here were four men who understood each other and their moment in history in a way that no one else could. With the Civil Rights movement stirring outside, and the melody of ‘A Change is Gonna Come’ hanging in the air, these men would emerge from that room ready to define a new world'. Reception The response to the European premiere praised both the outstanding individual performances and the committed ensemble playinghttp://www.victoriasadler.com/review-one-night-in-miami-donmar- warehouse-powerful-and-moving/ The Financial Times wrote about the play's depiction of a pivotal moment in black American history. The Evening Standard considered why it was more than just an Ali play. The play provokes and entertains as it depicts great humour and the complexities of the men's private selves behind their public personas. The London production in 2016 followed debates about black representation and 'race relations, black empowerment, and the twisted nature of celebrity' raised by the 2013 premiere in America The director, Kwame Kwei-Armah and the actors in the London run have described the process and demands involved in creating performances which aim to credibly define the characters, friendship and lives of four black, controversial icons at a critical point in their lives and as a part of American history. Sope Dirisu, who played Cassius Clay, said \\"people often sugar-coat Ali's life and find it convenient to forget the struggles of the time he lived through\\". All actors agreed when interviewed by the BBC that the play shouldn't be seen as a political tract. Dirisu also said Powers told the cast his play should feel like watching best friends in a room, \\"even in previews we've felt the audience picking up on that - I feel I'm on stage with my brothers. The energy is amazing.\\" David Ajala, who played Jim Brown, the NFL star, remembered something Powers said that really struck him, \\"Kemp said this was the play he would love to have seen as a 16-year-old - the black Avengers...a group of guys fighting for different causes but also for a common cause. And they're held in high regard and are iconic people. The simplicity of that and the excitement of it has really resonated with me: in that room we're all superheroes in our own way, in each other's company.\\"\\" François Battiste, the only American actor in the European premiere, who played Malcolm X, said, \\"you don't have the ability to tell these stories unless you are actively pursuing the new writers. There are a whole lot of writers out there who need to be heard.\\" Arinze Kene, whose portrayal effectively included singing Sam Cooke songs, commented on increasing diversity, \\"the fact that the situation is getting better shows not how great things are now, but only that they used to be even worse. We've got a long way to go.\\" Boxing commentators, expressed admiration for the credible language of the play, pointing out in regard to Clay/Ali that the production \\"succeeds in portraying a thoroughly believable Ali. Actor Sope Dirisu bounds around the room with Ali’s restless swagger. Writing lines for a man who came up with countless memorable quotes would be a tough ask for any playwright. Copy lines he used in other contexts and it risks sounding forced; come up with completely fresh ones and it risks sounding weak compared to the original. Kemp Powers pulls it off, capturing both the cockiness and the wit: \\"They had Joe Louis on one side of the ring, Rocky Marciano on the other. Halfway through the sixth, I saw them looking at each other, like they was asking themselves \\"why couldn’t we do that when we was young?\\" The Donmar Warehouse production which opened on 6 October 2016, is the first dramatic portrayal of the boxer Muhammad Ali since he died aged 74 in June 2016. Ali’s family gave their blessing to the production.

He built a number of offshore lighthouses and was responsible for the design of the Fastnet Rock lighthouse. Early life His father was Nicholas Douglass who in 1839 was engaged by Trinity House as a constructive engineer, rising in the course of time to be its superintending engineer. His two sons, James and Nicholas would accompany their father to his place of work from an early age. William, born in London, was apprenticed to the engineering firm of Robert Stephenson & Co, Newcastle upon Tyne, and studied under George's son Robert. In 1847 Mr Nicholas Douglass was selected by his employers, Trinity House, to erect the first lighthouse on the Bishop Rock. The first attempt, designed by the engineer-in-chief, James Walker, decided on a comprised accommodation and a light on top of iron legs, but it was swept away in a storm in 1850. In the second attempt, James Walker changed to building a stone structure, starting in 1851. James Douglass had been his fathers assistant but desired to join a firm on the Tyne to gain additional experience, so in 1852, William was appointed in his stead and the lighthouse was completed in 1858 without loss of life. Engineering Les Hanois Lighthouse In October 1859 William was appointed as resident engineer on a new project, Les Hanois Lighthouse on rocks off the south-west coast of Guernsey. The tower design by James Walker encompassed the basic design shape created by Robert Stevenson with amendments to incorporate suggestions by his father, Nicholas Douglass to make the stones lock together using, dovetail joints on the horizontal and vertical; the first time this method had been tried. It was noted that William commanded the \\"unbounded confidence\\" of his working parties, his \\"courage and resources being equal to every emergency\\". William proved to be an inspiring and inspired choice as the resident engineer. A grand stone laying ceremony took place on 14 August 1860 before a large crowd on local boats. The light was turned on in November 1862 with the tower commissioned in August 1863. The cost amounting to £25,296. Wolf Rock Lighthouse James Douglass, the brother of William was at that time engaged in building the Wolf Rock Lighthouse when James Walker died and James was appointed as the new engineer- in-chief to the Trinity House. William was called in to continue the work off the Isles of Scilly. Continuing his system of being the first to land, the last to leave and ensuring safety lines were fastened to each man William, who was a strong swimmer, worked on the lighthouse, on one occasion risking his life to steer a boat in storm seas close to the partly built lighthouse so that supplies could be delivered to the men stranded on the rock. Completed on 19 July 1869, the light was first lit in January 1870. George Robert Stephenson (a future President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and a member of the firm of Robert Stephenson & Co.) commented: \\"I have passed the Wolf Rock many times under great trepidation. I know of no site or position for a lighthouse which required more skill, or involved more difficulties and dangers, than was the case with the Wolf Rock structure.\\" Great Basses Reef lighthouse The next project was the Great Basses Reef Lighthouse, designed by brother James, William was appointed executive engineer and set sail to Ceylon to work on the lighthouse, arriving in December 1869. Two steam ships, each capable of carrying 120 tonnes of stone and equipped with lifting gear for the 2–3 ton stones arrived and the first stone, which had been quarried in Scotland, was laid in December 1870. By late 1872 the masonry was complete and the light installed in March 1873. The cost amounted to £63,000 of which £40,000 had been expended to no result before Trinity House was involved. William was praised for his courage and ability. A similar tower was requested for the Little Basses Reef Lighthouse, and using the same ships, crews and workers a second tower was constructed by William which became operational in 1878. Having completed twenty-six years service with Trinity House, in 1878 William left to become the engineer-in-chief to the Commissioners of Irish Lights where he took over work in progress, introducing new technology to improved fog systems, the oil burners and built gas burning lamps, rebuilding a number of lighthouses; the largest project being the new Fastnet Rock lighthouse from 1896 which William designed, using the skills he had first learned with Les Hanois Lighthouse.F. Pelly, \\"William Douglass – Designer of Fastnet Lighthouse\\" in Beam: Journal of the Irish Lighthouse Service. Vol. 33 (2004–05). He spent time on the rock supervising the first stones, but his heath deteriorated and in 1900 he resigned with the tower still incomplete. Personal life At Penzance, in 1868, William Douglass married Jane, daughter of Henry Hodge, of St Levan. Two sons and two daughters survived, the two sons both joined the army, one served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, the other the Royal Engineers. On retirement William settled in Penzance where he would live for a further twenty-two years. In 1914, concerned about the submarine menace, he designed a method to bomb submarines, which he sent to the Admiralty. He died on 10 March 1923.

It ended in April with modest gains for shoemakers, including pay increases and owner recognition of some labor unions. Approximately 20,000 workers went on strike across New England which made it the largest mass walkout in American history prior to the Civil War.The Boot and Shoe Workers' Union, Historical Encyclopedia of American Labor, 2004. Background The Panic of 1857 resulted in the temporary loss of jobs for many shoemakers. Workers were also angry at the increasing mechanization of the shoemaking process. When companies began hiring again, the cost of shoes went up and wages declined significantly. Hours were long (16 hours of work per day) and wages were low; men were earning only $3 a week and women just $1. In early 1860, the Mechanics Association was formed and it demanded higher wages. The company owners refused to meet with committees of the association and workers decided to strike. Strike The beginning date of the strike was intentionally chosen to coincide with the birthday of former U.S. President George Washington. Within a week, the strike had spread to 25 other New England towns, including towns in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and even New York. 20,000 more shoemakers refused to work while 20,000 others openly supported the shoemakers with marches, parades and opposition to the police. Women played a crucial role in the strike, including the leading of a 6,000 person process through a late winter blizzard in Lynn on March 8 with signs reading \\"American Ladies Will Not Be Slaves: Give Us a Fair Compensation and We Will Labour Cheerfully\\". The strike occurred during the 1860 presidential election and Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln voiced his support for the workers, saying \\"I am glad to see that a system of labor prevails in New England Under which laborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to labor whether you pay them or not. I like a system which lets a man quit when he wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere.\\" At the time, it was one of the largest workers' protest in United States history. The strike, which had widespread community support, mostly ended on April 10 when 30 employers signed agreements to raise wages. The strike is considered a partial win for workers, as their newly recognized unions were recognized and most workmen received wage increases. A key leader of the strike was Alonzo G. Draper, who later became a Civil War General in the Union Army and died in 1865.

The failure of the revolt saw the reformers, including Nagy and Vasárhelyi, take refuge at the Yugoslav embassy. After leaving the embassy under a guarantee of safety, they were arrested and initially deported to Romania. In the trials that followed, Vasárhelyi was sentenced to five years in prison while Nagy was hanged. Vasárhelyi was released in 1960 and performed freelance work as a translator until 1972. The government of János Kádár began taking a softer approach and Vasárhelyi found work at the Hungarian Academy of Science’s Institute of Literary Studies and as a script editor. He completed a book in 1974, The Lord and the Crown. In 1983, he obtained a fellowship at Columbia University as a guess professor of media history. There he struck up a friendship with George Soros. He eventually became the Soros Foundation’s representative in Hungary and helped set up educational exchanges. After the fall of the Communist regime, Vasárhelyi helped establish the Alliance of Free Democrats. At the first free elections, he won a seat in the National Assembly with the party and served from 1990 to 1994. Vasárhelyi died on July 31, 2001 in Budapest.

Amro, who was then in his last year of an engineering degree, decided to take action against the closures. With the participation of other students of the university, Amro organized actions of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience for half a year. These actions included protests and demonstrations, moving into classrooms, sit-ins, and having lessons in the presence of Israeli soldiers. The campaigning was a success and the university was reopened in June.Occupied Campus: The Israeli Military Closure of Hebron University Right to Education Campaign.

He took inspiration from known human rights defenders, such as Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela. He stated in a piece for The Guardian: > \\"I became convinced that their non-violent method was the best strategy for > community resistance.

Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564 (1976), was a United States Supreme Court case that determined that it is not necessary to provide full Miranda warnings to a person called to testify before a grand jury; and that false statements given during that testimony may not be suppressed in a subsequent prosecution for perjury..  Background  In 1973, Roy Mandujano negotiated with an undercover narcotics officer to purchase an ounce of heroin for six hundred fifty dollars. The transaction was never completed. Mandujano was then called before the grand jury, where he testified regarding his familiarity of the heroin industry in San Antonio, Texas. He was not given Miranda warnings before testifying. After his testimony, Mandujano was arrested for 1) attempted distribution of heroin and 2) perjury, but the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas suppressed the grand jury statements on the grounds that Mandujano was entitled to Miranda warnings before his testimony. Thus, the perjury charge was thrown out; however, Mandujano was convicted of the distribution charge. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the decision to throw out the perjury charges on June 28, 1974.  Supreme Court Decision  The decisions by the District Court and Appellate Court to throw out the perjury charges were reversed and remanded by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court determined that the grand jury is an integral part of the United States constitutional heritage which was brought with the common law. Furthermore, the grand jury serves as a barrier to reckless or unfounded charges. Miranda warnings are aimed at the evils seen by the Court as endemic to police interrogation of a person in custody. The Court considers it unlikely that a grand jury will abuse powers as police sometimes do. Therefore, it is not necessary to provide full Miranda warnings to a person called to testify before the grand jury. Furthermore, false statements given during that testimony may not be suppressed in a subsequent prosecution for perjury. However, the Court did not decide whether a suspect questioned before a grand jury had a right to be warned of their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The defendant in this case received such a warning.Mandujano, 425 U.S. at 592, n. 7.  Fifth Circuit guidance on defining \\"attempt\\"  On August 19, 1974, the Fifth Circuit Court of appeals affirmed Mandujano's conviction of attempted distribution of heroin. This case is worth noting for how the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit summarized approaches to defining what constitutes an \\"attempt\\" to commit a crime.Defining Attempts: Mandujano's Error, Duke University, Michael R. Fishman, Criminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , Attempt has two elements, intent, and some conduct toward completion of the crime).

Ali's visits to China resulted in a revival of boxing in China, and influenced the development of the sport in China. First visit (1979) Ali's first visit to China was in December, 1979. At this time, boxing was banned in China; the ban being imposed in 1959 after a death in the ring caused concerns about safety. During this visit, Ali met Deng Xiaoping, and informed Deng of his desire to revive boxing in China. \\"As long as people like it, we will develop it...Boxing can also be a bridge which enhances mutual understanding and friendship between Chinese and American people,\\" was Deng's reply to Ali. The visit was also important in the diplomatic sphere. Ali had gone to China as the first foreign athlete to visit the country at the invitation of the Chinese Olympic Committee and the China Sports Federation; he was also acting as an envoy of President Jimmy Carter in this visit with the mission of persuading China to participate in the 1984 Olympics. Pictures of Ali shaking hands with Deng gave a signal of China's willingness to engage with the world. Second visit (1985) Ali's second visit to China was in 1985. In an interview he gave during this visit, Ali defended boxing's relative safety comparing it favorably with sports like car racing and skiing which he argued were more unsafe. This argument is believed to have resonated with the Chinese, and paved the way for a revival of boxing in China. During this visit, Ali agreed to have boxing sessions with promising boxers. One of these fights was with a 20 year old light weight Wang Wei before 500 students at Peking Sports Institute. However, this was not a serious fight; Ali kept dancing away from his opponent, moved his right fist in exaggerated circles, and then pretended that he had been knocked out. Wang Wei described the fight as the \\"greatest day of his life.\\" A photograph of this visit, taken in a Shanghai gym, depicts a \\"rail-thin\\" boxer, Xiong Wei, reaching up to jab Ali; and Ali, in dark trousers and a white dress shirt, covering his face with his gloves. In a June 2016 interview, Xiong Wei's son Xiong Xin, a prominent Chinese boxer, said: In an article published in China Youth News, Ali wrote: \\"Now that you are open to the world, never lose your culture, because others will try to give you their culture.\\" Third visit (1993) Ali's third visit to China was in 1993, and it was during this visit that an international boxing match was held in Beijing for the first time. Ali visited Shanghai during this visit and interacted with students. Influence In 1987, China held its first national boxing championships, and the following month the China Boxing Association became an official member of the International Amateur Boxing Association, following which China started appearing on the boxing stage internationally. Ali has been credited for this development. At Ali's death, Zou Shiming, wrote on Weibo that he had intended to meet Ali after winning a professional bout, \\"[b]ut now, I can only pray he is at peace in heaven, and free from illness and pain.\\" In an interview, Zou mentioned that he was deeply grieved to hear the news of Ali's death, since Ali had been a source of great inspiration to him. According to the BBC, Chinese media has highlighted Ali's refusal to be drafted, and his activism related to civil rights.

Centered on the junction of Main and River Streets are a cluster of mainly brick buildings, built between 1880 and 1920, with several industrial properties just across the Missisquoi River to the south, whose waters provided the power for the industries that fueled the town's growth. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The northern Vermont town of Richford developed in the late 1790s around a series of falls on the upper Missisquoi River, where its early settlers built sawmills and gristmills. In the 1850s it developed as a regional commercial and industrial center, spurred by tariff reductions for trade with neighboring Quebec, which brought a market for area goods and an influx of French-speaking immigrants. The mills were located primarily on the south side of the falls, powered by a water diverted into a raceway east of the area, and the town's commercial center grew on the north side of the falls. The area declined economically after World War I, and has remained at a reduced level of economic activity since. with The historic district encompasses both commercial and industrial buildings arranged on either side of the Missisquoi River, which Main Street crosses on a 1928 pony truss bridge, built after the previous crossing was washed away in 1927. From the junction of Main and River Streets, brick commercial buildings extend east and west on the south side of River Street, and on the north side west of the junction. These were almost all built between 1880 and 1920, and are in typical commercial variants of Italianate and Queen Anne styling. South of the river, on the west side of Main Street, stand two industrial buildings, built in 1908 out of concrete blocks by the Sweat-Comings Company, and the adjacent fire station, built by town but also out of concrete blocks.

Modelled on the Cadet Corps in England, now organised as the Army Cadet Force and the Combined Cadet Force, it was organised separately under Acts of the Parliament of Bermuda. It wasn’t one of three Cadet Corps that historically operated in the British territory, with the others being the Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps (with the Girls Nautical Training Corps) and the Air Training Corps, of which only the Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps remains. After more than a century of existence, the Bermuda Cadet Corps was disbanded in 2013 and replaced by the resurrected Junior Leaders programme of the Royal Bermuda Regiment. History Cadet Corps (Saltus Grammar School), ca. 1901 Bermuda Cadet Corps in Second World War In 1901, Saltus Grammar School in Pembroke, raised a Cadet Corps, which was attached to the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC). On the 12 April 1901, the General Commanding the Bermuda Garrison received notification that the Governor and military Commander-in-Chief had appointed Captain R.W. Appleby of the BVRC to be a Captain with the Cadet Corps (dated 11 February).Extracts From Brigade Orders, The Royal Gazette. 16 April 1901 The Cadet Corps (Saltus Grammar School) often trained alongside the BVRC, as on the 24 May 1902, when the cadets assembled at Fort Hamilton before marching to the Army Service Corps Wharf at East Broadway, from whence they were driven to Warwick Camp to watch the riflery training of the BVRC. On the 24 May 1907, the Cadet Corps was delivered, along with the Headquarters and \\"C\\" Companies of the BVRC, to St. George's to join the other two companies of the BVRC for their annual camp. The Cadet Corps was perceived by the Government as a valuable method by which to boost recruitment into the BVRC, which was struggling to maintain its mandated strength. It was thought that, following their early exposure to military service, many Cadets would choose to enlist into the BVRC upon finishing their schooling. In 1907, the Cadet Corps was expanded with War Office approval to eight other schools in Bermuda, including civilian schools such as Whitney Institute, as well as the military garrison schools, and the Royal Naval Dockyard school. The expanded Cadet Corps remained attached to the BVRC, and its Cadets wore the BVRC cap badge. At the time, all of the schools included barred black students, and the Cadet Corps (like the BVRC) was consequently made up of whites only. There was a second part-time military unit in Bermuda, the Bermuda Militia Artillery, which recruited primarily coloured soldiers, although its officers were all white until 1953. The Cadet Corps was re-organised under the Bermuda Cadet Corps Act 1944. The BVRC was disbanded (along with the BMA) in 1946, with most personnel transferred to the Reserve. A skeleton staff remained to maintain facilities and equipment until both units were built back up with new recruitment in 1951, at which time the BVRC was re-titled the Bermuda Rifles. Although a common Bermuda Local Forces Headquarters was created to oversee both units (not to be confused with the overall Command Headquarters which controlled both the regular and part-time army units in Bermuda), they remained separate and blacks were still restricted to the BMA, even after the last coastal artillery was withdrawn from use in 1953 and the BMA converted to the infantry role. By this time (created during the Second World War), there was a Cadet Corps at Berkley Institute the highest-rated school for blacks in Bermuda. This was not considered part of the Bermuda Cadet Corps, however. During the 1950s, it was decided the Bermuda Cadet Corps should have its own band. Through the influence of officers of Scottish heritage, some of whom had served in Scottish regiments during the Second World War, this was created as a Scottish bagpipe and drum band, wearing Highland dress, although the remainder of the Bermuda Cadet Corps dressed as English and Welsh regiments do. In 1965, the BMA and the Bermuda Rifles were amalgamated to form the Bermuda Regiment (since 2015, the Royal Bermuda Regiment). The Bermuda Cadet Corps was re-organised at the same time. Racial segregation of the public school system also ended during the 1960s, and the Bermuda Cadet Corps, now wearing its own badge, subsequently operated through all of the colony's public and Government-aided secondary schools. The Cadet Pipe Band was left out of this re-organisation, and its members chose to continue it as a private organisation, continuing to wear the Bermuda Rifles cap badge. In the 1990s, by when its membership was entirely made-up of adults, it merged with another pipe band composed primarily of Bermuda Police Service constables and Bermuda Fire Service personnel. The Bermuda Pipe Band continues to take part in military parades along with the band of the Royal Bermuda Regiment. Disbandment The Bermuda Regiment operated its own Junior Leaders programme for many years, the members of which wore the Bermuda Regiment cap badge, and was based with the rest of the regiment at Warwick Camp. The Junior Leaders programme was absorbed into the Bermuda Cadet Corps in the mid-1990s as the Bermuda Regiment found it an unnecessary duplication to support two youth organisations. However, in 2012, due to financial constraints, the Bermuda Cadet Corps was disbanded and replaced by the resurrected Bermuda Regiment Junior Leaders.The Royal Gazette: Cadet Corp to be replaced as budget savings are made.

As a teenager, she wrote Abzurdah, an autobiography that detailed her problems with anorexia and bulimia. The book was a success, and got a film adaption in 2015 starring María Eugenia Suárez. Biography Cielo Latini was born on 14 June 1984, in La Plata, Argentina. She started and dropped her study of journalism at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina. She fell in love with Alejandro, who was 10 years older than her. She developed anorexia and bulimia in her attempts to improve her physical image, and started a web page, \\"Me como a mí\\", encouraging other girls to embrace those disorders. She tried to commit suicide when Alejandro left her, but she was saved. She started rehabilitation, and eventually started dating again. She came up with the idea of writing about her eating disorders and her relationship with Alejandro, writing her autobiography, Abzurdah, at the age of 20. The book was a huge success and she was interviewed on radio and TV, including Almorzando con Mirtha Legrand. During those interviews she met the journalist Rolando Graña and they fell in love, despite having a 25-year age gap. They had two daughters and later separated. Latini wrote a second book, Chubasco, based on the story of a friend. This book was also a success, and she received proposals to make film adaptions of it. She sold the rights for a film adaption of Abzurdah in 2006, after the release and success of the book. The film was not made, and the rights returned to her five years later. She sold them again, and then the book was adapted into an eponymous film in 2015, starring María Eugenia Suárez as Latini. The film was made a decade after the release of the book, and Latini was not involved with the production. She first saw it in a private show.

History The castle of Dobrá Voda was presumably built in the last third of the 13th century by Comes Aba from the Hlohovec branch of the Aba clan, when royal power declined in the Kingdom of Hungary. According to a legend though, the castle was constructed by the lover of a local girl who cured the king with water from the local spring. In 1316 Matthew III Csák occupied the Dobrá Voda castle just like other castles in the region. In 1394 the castle was part of the royal donation to duke Stibor of Stiboricz. A group of unsatisfied magnates and prelates wanted to get rid of King Sigismund in 1403. As the castellan of the castle joined the rebellion, the royal army was forced to reconquer the castle. After 1436 Dobrá Voda castle became property of the Ország family. In the first third of the 16th century the lord of the castle, László Ország, died. His widow remarried with the head of the Nógrád, István Losonci who acquired the ownership rights of the castle through this marriage. In the autumn of 1567 the Ország family died out with the passing of László's son, Kristóf Ország. King Maximilian pawned the Dobrá Voda castle to the Croat nobleman Ján Choron of Deveč. Another Croat nobleman, Krsto Ungnad, showed interest in obtaining the Dobrá Voda castle. As the husband of István Losonci's daughter Anna, who inherited the filial rights after her father's death, he applied his option to the castle. In 1583 he bought the castle with all the corresponding properties for 70 guldens from King Rudolph. Through his daughter Anna Mária, married to the anti-Ottoman wars hero Tamás Erdődy, the castle became in the hands of the Erdődy family. By the end of the 17th century the Erdődy family already possessed and inhabited many manor houses in various towns. This caused the Dobrá Voda castle to be abandoned. At the beginning of the 18th century the war events during Rákóczi's War of Independence destroyed the castle. After being hit by a lightning , the castle burned down in 1762. Only a prison for nobility remained in the castle for a certain time. Architecture The upper-castle consists of two prismatic towers with an oblong palace between them. Only the northern wall of the palace survived up to today. Next to the eastern tower is a small yard with a cistern with a well-preserved sink. A courtyard extends to the east of the upper-castle. A presumably Gothic chapel sits at the eastern end of this courtyard. Another possible function of the structure is that it was part of the palace, which formed with its courtyard a fortified residence independent of the original castle. The upper- castle was widened in the west with a forecastle. A cannon bastion further improved its defence. The entrance in front of the gate was fortified with a simple barbican. Because of the constant threat of Ottoman attacks an extensive lower-castle with auxiliary buildings secured with cannon bastions was constructed. The access road to the upper-castle ran through four gates connected by serpentines with straight stretches so that it could always be defended form a higher situated spot.

At the age of 33 years Sutton married Helen Annie Fox (1852-1932) who was born in Sheffield and ran the family cutlery store in Victoria.https://anglersparadise.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/everything-but-the- fish-at-foxs/ They did not have children.  Education  Sutton attended public schools in Kincardine and Walkerton followed by a year at Trinity College School, Port Hope, Ontario (1873-1874). He then went to Sibley College of Mechanical Arts, Cornell (1874-1876)] but dropped out after completing two years to take a short business course at Hamilton Business College before attending the Columbia School of Mines (1876-1877). In 1895 he took a special course in chemistry, mineralogy, petrography and geology, at the Michigan School of Mines, following which he became assistant teacher helping various professors in metallurgy, assaying, biology, zoology, palaeontology, mineralogy, crystallography, petrology, lithology and geology. Alongside his teaching he completed his degree with a 54-page thesis entitled Geology of Penokee-Gogebic Iron Bearing District in 1898 and was awarded an E.M. (Mining Engineer) degree.Robertson, William Fleet, 1916, Memorial to William John Sutton, Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, Volume 27.  Timberman  At the age of 18 years he set up an assaying business in Victoria, Vancouver Island but was forced to close it due to lack of interest and joined his father's lumber business. His father was the first to obtain a timber licence from the government for 7,070 acres of land at Cowichan Lake. He built a sawmill at Snug Creek, Mahoney's Bay (now Genoa Bay).Sawywell, John F.T. 1967 Kaatza, The Cowichan Lake District Centennial Committee, Sidney, British Columbia, Canada. William John, known to his family as Will, ran his father's lumber business for ten years whilst his father was sheriff of Bruce County, Ontario.  Political ambitions  Sutton stood in two elections for the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. His first attempt was in 1887 after the death of Premier William Smithe when he stood for Cowichan but was narrowly beaten by Henry Fry.The Colonist, 29 April 1887 The second attempt was in 1894 when he stood for Cowichan and Alberni but was again narrowly defeated by Major J.M. Mutter.The Colonist, 2 May 1894  Government assayer  After tragedy struck the Sutton family when his cousin Alfred was accidentally shot, the sawmill was closed down and Will was appointed Government Assayer (1887-1889). A report he submitted to the Minister of Mines in 1888 includes a list of 35 examples of economic minerals found in the Province. An article in The Colonist describes his work as Government Assayer.The Colonist, 17 August 1889 Will was forced to resign to sort out his father's lumber business but under his management the assay office \\"had been converted to a model of its kind.\\" Shortly after leaving his post he facilitated the sale of the family lumber business.  Phrenology and grave robbing  William John and his brother James Edward, were both keen phrenologists and had given several lectures in Victoria on the topic. In connection with phrenology they both began robbing the graves of First Nation people on Vancouver Island to sell the skulls to the American phrenology market. On hearing about their collection of 75 skulls Franz Boas, the 'father of American anthropology' bought the collection. Boas employed the Sutton brothers to collect more. Altogether the Sutton brothers provided Boas with about 200 skulls and skeletons. Boas used the skulls from the Northwest Coast to challenge the scientific idea of a 'pure race.' Franz Boas then sold the remains to Rudolph Virchow's Pathological Museum in Berlin and the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago.Cole, Douglas, 1985, Captured Heritage, The Scramble for North West Artifacts, UBC Press.  Sutton Lumber and Trading Company  The Sutton Lumber and Trading Company Limited was incorporated in 1893 with $100,000 and William, William John and James Edward Sutton were the first trustees. They acquired 2,500 acres of timber land in the Clayoqout District and West Coast of Vancouver Island, some of which were Crown granted and some held under timber leases from the Crown. William John and James Edward were amongst the first white settlers in Ucluelet where they built the first general store and sawmill. The company was eventually sold to W. H. and A. F. McEwan of Seattle, the principals in the Seattle Cedar Lumber Manufacturing Company. Sutton continued to own and manage the Ucluelet Mercantile Company Sawmill until his death.  Geologist for James Dunsmuir  On his return to Victoria in 1900 Sutton took up the post of geologist for the coal and rail baron James Dunsmuir. In this position he worked for both the Wellington Colliery Company and the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway as well as being James Dunsmuir's personal geologist and in this role he travelled around British Columbia and further afield looking for opportunities to expand the Dunsmuir empire. Sutton surveyed and geologically mapped much of Vancouver Island as the Wellington Colliery Company owned the coal rights under a large portion of the Island.Robertson, ibid. As part of the Canadian Geological Survey, Sutton surveyed the central part of the eastern coast of Vancouver Island in July 1909. He remained with the Company when they were taken over by Canadian Pacific Railway until his death in 1914, from a heart attack, whilst running a survey line for a road being constructed in Ucluelet.  Treasure Island  Sutton gave several public lectures on the natural wealth of Vancouver Island, including delivering a paper,The Geology and Mining of Vancouver Island, to the Geological Society in Manchester in 1903. He became a leader in the movement to promote the Island to the rest of the world and was instrumental in the establishment of the Vancouver Island Development League being elected to first vice-president of the Victoria branch of the League in 1911 and 1912.  Forest preservation  William John Sutton was one of the first to advocate preservation of the forests in British Columbia. He gave evidence to several government commissions (1905, 1909) and in 1910 published, as a member of the Natural History Society, a booklet, Our Timber and its Conservation,Sutton, William J., 1910, Our timber wealth and its conservation, Issue 3 of Bulletin of Natural History Society of British Columbia.Internet Archive in which he described 18 commercial species of forest trees. He argued that timber resources in British Columbia were comparatively limited and was critical of current government practice in regard to land leases and taxes. He recommended the government establish a forestry commission identifying key areas for research. He used his booklet to submit evidence to the Fulton Royal Commission on Timber and Forestry and some of his recommendations were accepted by the government. He gave further evidence to an Assessment and Taxation Commission in 1911 as well as to the Forestry and Conservation Convention in Vancouver in January 1914.Brownstein, David, 2006, Sunday Walks and Seed Traps: The Many Natural Histories of British Columbia Forest Conservation, 1890-1925, A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The University of British Columbia.  Strathcona Park  As a member of the British Columbia Board of Trade, the Natural History Society and the Vancouver Island Development League, Sutton played an important role in helping to facilitate the establishment of Strathcona Provincial Park.Young, Paula, 1905-16, Creating a \\"Natural Asset\\": British Columbia's First Park, Strathcona, BC Studies.  Respected scientist  In his final years Sutton became a powerful person in British Columbia. He was Chairman of the Western Branch of the Canadian Mining Institute and Vice-President of the Canadian Mining Institute (1914); as well as being a Fellow of the Royal Geological Society of London. He sat on the Board of Trade, and had been president of the Natural History Society (1912). He campaigned for a well-equipped seismological station at Victoria (a new Meteorological Station was built at Gonzales Height, Victoria in 1916)The Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Vol XLIX, No 4, July–August 1955, Whole Number 415, p. 141. and was also a founding member of the Royal Astronomical Society in Victoria, being a member of the Executive Committee and instrumental in forming the Centre in Victoria.  Pacific Museum of Earth, Vancouver  Sutton is credited with identifying 35 notable occurrences of minerals in Canada, see A List of Canadian Mineral Occurrences, Robert A.A. Johnson, 1915. His unique collection of minerals and fossils was one of the founding collections of the Geology Museum of the University of British Columbia at the Beaty Biodiversity Museum and is on show at the Pacific Museum of Earth, Vancouver.  Name lives on  William John Sutton's influence on Vancouver Island is visible in the places named after him, such as Sutton Pass,Report of the Minister of Mines, 1926. Sutton Boulders, Lost Shoe CreekThe Colonist, 15 February 1903. and Sutton Rock;Scott, Andrew, 2009, The Encyclopedia of Raincoast Placenames, Harbour Publishing. as well as the Sutton Limestones.The Colonist, 13 January 1915.  Photograph album  His wife, Helen Annie, outlived Sutton by 18 years; she compiled an album of some of his photographs which her sister presented to the archive at the Royal British Columbia Museum in 1933. There are 57 photographs including geological features, First Nation villages, Cowichan Lake and river; and several 'ghost' towns on mainland British Columbia.  Family legend  William John Sutton was well known in his lifetime, but has since been forgotten. He comes from a line of legendary Suttons. His father William Sutton built the first grist mill in Kincardine, Ontario and became the first sheriff of Bruce County only to be sacked after 25 years.Robertson, Norman, 1906, The History of the County of Bruce, Bruce County Historical Society. It has been suggested his grandfather, Richard Sutton, was a role model for Emily Brontë's Heathcliff.Lyon, K, 1985, The Dentdale Brontë Trail; Heywood, Christopher, 1987, Yorkshire Slavery in Wuthering Heights, Review of English Studies, volume 37 issue 150; Heywood, Christopher, Spring 1987, THE SEDBERGH CONNECTION Hartley Coleridge and The Bronte Novels, Sedbergh Historian; Heywood, Christopher, 2001, editor, Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte, Broadview Editions.

The Act creates a statutory basis for the rule against trying a person twice for the same crime (known as double jeopardy). The Act also creates three narrow exceptions to this rule. Following the acquittal of Angus Sinclair for the World's End Murders in 2007, on 20 November 2007 the then Cabinet Secretary for Justice Kenny MacAskill MSP instructed the Scottish Law Commission to consider the law relating to several issues arising from the trial and make recommendations for reform. One of these issues was \\"the principle of double jeopardy, and whether there should be exceptions to it\\" In December 2009 the Scottish Law Commission published its report on the principle of double jeopardy. The commission recommended that the principle be retained in Scottish Law and also \\"The general rule against double jeopardy should be reformed and restated in statute\\". The commission further recommended that exceptions to the rule be created in three circumstances: * Where the acquittal is tainted by offences against the course of justice such as (but not limited to) bribery, perverting the course of justice and subornation of perjury. The commission concluded that perjury in itself should not be suitable grounds to order a retrial. * Where the previously acquitted has made a credible admission of guilt. * Where new evidence which was not and could not with ordinary diligence have been available at the trial has been found. The commission recommended that this only be permitted where the new evidence \\"substantially strengthens the case against the accused\\" and that if a reasonable jury had heard the evidence at the trial that this would have made it highly likely that the accused be convicted. The commission addressed the issue of retrospectivity, recommending that any exceptions to the rule of double jeopardy only apply to cases heard after any legislation created to create the exceptions is passed. This recommendation was not followed by the Scottish Government and the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Bill introduced on 7 October 2010 included provisions to apply the proposed legislation retrospectively. Almost all of the other recommendations made by the Commission made it into the bill.

It was created in 1925 on the occasion of the 60th birthday of Jac. P. Thijsse, naturalist and nature conservationist. It is the oldest wildlife garden in the Netherlands, and one of the oldest of Europe, and in the world. In Thijsse's Hof about 800 species of native plants can be found in South Kennemerland, the region in which Bloemendaal is situated. Most of the plants are grown in natural vegetations. The garden is also a home for many birds. Its full name is Thijsse's Hof; planten- en vogeltuin in het Bloemendaalsche Bosch (Garden of Thijsse : garden for plants and birds in the Bloemendaal Wood).Most of the information in the first version of this page is taken from :nl:Thijsse's Hof on the Dutch Wikipedia, where (Dutch) sources are given (acquired 2016-10-22) and from an (English language) information leaflet, acquired in 2016 in Thijsse's Hof.  History  Statue of Jac.P.Thijsse, the founder of the Hof In 1925 the garden was offered to Jac. P. Thijsse as a present for his 60th birthday. Friends of Thijsse wanted to honor Thijsse by creating a little garden, close to his house, where the plants and animals of the dune area could be displayed in a natural environment. It was known that this was already a long time wish of Thijsse. The garden was designed by the landscape architect Leonard Springer. In 1920 the Bloemendaal Wood had become the property of the municipality of Bloemendaal. A small terrain in the wood, behind the pancake house on the Mollaan, was oak coppice, where potatoes were grown. This terrain of about 2 ha. was given to a foundation in the making, that would run the new wildlife garden. Works were started on 2 January 1925. Thijsse himself was involved in the activities to create the garden. The design, created by Springer, is still largely intact. The garden was designed in a way, that in spring the herbs had plenty of light. Later in the year the shrubs start growing, and still later the bigger trees. Thijsse became the first president of the foundation “Planten- en vogeltuin in het Bloemendaalsche Bosch”. The foundation was founded on 17 July 1925. At 25 July – his birthday – Thijsse received the special key to the special entrance that was created for him, close to his house. The garden was officially opened on 26 September. On that day it rained a lot. The planting of the garden was done by Kees Sipkes, who ran a nursery for native plants near Haarlem. Thijsse himself wanted to name the garden after Frederik van Eeden (sr., the botanist). But his friends thought the name “Garden of E(e)den” not really appropriate, so “Thijsse's Hof” was chosen. Thijsse wrote a lot about his garden in journals and magazines. He wrote two books on Thijsse's Hof: * * 1940: Een jaar in Thijsse's Hof: lente-zomer- herfst-winter (A year in Thijsse's Hof: spring-summer-autumn-winter). (2nd impression 1940; 3rd impression 1942; 4th: 1943; 5th. 1946). The book was published as part 2 of the Heemschutserie, by Allert de Lange, Amsterdam.WorldCat entry for Thijsse 1940 * 1942: Een tweede jaar in Thijsse's Hof. (A second year in Thijsse's Hof). Amsterdam : Allert de Lange.WorldCat entry for Thijsse 1942 (abusively spelled as “Thysse's hof”)  Vegetation types  The most important vegetation types of the dunes of South Kennemerland are present in Thijsse's Hof. ; The dune woodland In the dune woodland the common oak Quercus robur is dominating. This vegetation type has a lot of other trees and shrubs as well, like European beech Fagus sylvatica, bird cherry Prunus padus, hawthorn, hazel and yew. The floor level of the woodland has many flowering plants. Snowdrop and spring snowflake flowering in winter and early spring. Wood anemone, bird-in-a-bush, primrose, bluebell, leopard's-bane and ramsons flowering in April and May. The woodland is rich in birds like chaffinch, chiffchaff, blackbird, song thrush and tits. ; The dune scrub The dune scrub is the vegetation type with shrubs dominating. On the calcareous soils of the dunes the spindle tree, hawthorn, sea buckthorn, buckthorn and barberry are growing. When the shrubs have berries in autumn, they attract various birds. ; The coppice The coppice is a low woodland, with trees that are regularly coppiced ; The pond The pond lies in the centre of Thijsse's Hof, and plays an important role, from the point of view of garden architecture, as well as from the point of view of the ecological value. It attracts many bird species and insects, like dragonflies. In the water several plants are growing, like spiked water milfoil, mare's tail and fringed water lily. ; The dune slack The dune slack lies between the pond and the dry dune grassland. The vegetation is dependent on the vicinity of ground water. Southern marsh orchid, meadowsweet and yellow loosestrife are among the plant species that grow here. ; The dry dune grassland Between the dune slack and the dune slack is a gradual transition. The dry grassland is abundantly flowering in May and June with species like field scabious, common knapweed and salad burnet.

The house was given its present shape by Joseph Cota, a worker for the Central Vermont Railroad. Cota needed more space for his large family, and also updated it with modest elements of then-fashionable Queen Anne styling. It was divided into a two-family in the early 1900s, and the property had as many as four units, some of which were located in auxiliary buildings to the rear (since removed).

The rising of the prices decreased the quality of life. Therefore, many Peruvians opted for this unique form of helping each other or helping themselves, selling a food that helped to meet the needs that they could have.

Orthodontics In 1946, he investigated the morphology of tissue changes and presented his thesis in 1951 called \\"The initial tissue reaction incident to orthodontic tooth movement as related to the influence of function\\". He worked on dogs on his experiment. His research was key in distinguishing the tissue response difference between animals and humans. His research was important in introducing possibly detrimental effects of orthodontics on tooth movement.

In the 1950s, he fathered the 5BX (Five Basic Exercises) fitness program developed for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). The Tett Centre for Creativity and Learning in Kingston, Ontario is named after him. Early Life and Wartime Service John Tett, a great-grandson of Benjamin Tett, was born in Kingston, Ontario. His father Arthur, a banker, had enlisted in the Canadian army, but died in England when his son was still an infant. John grew up in Toronto, and became a competitive swimmer and diver; by 1936-37 he was the assistant coach of swimming/diving at the University of Toronto. In July, 1940 he enlisted in the RCAF and subsequently became a pilot officer. In April, 1941 he was posted to No. 103 Squadron RAF in England. Roughly two months later, following a raid on Hamburg, his bomber crash-landed in the North Sea. According to the official Mentioned in Despatches \\"During the subsequent thirteen hours in which the crew drifted in the dinghy, Pilot Officer Tett offered a source of encouragement to all.\\" For this, and for bravery during other missions over Germany, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on June 22, 1943. After being repatriated to Canada and helping with RCAF recruitment until the war ended, he was released from service in May, 1945. Postwar Life and Legacy Following the war, \\"Johnny\\" Tett was appointed Director of Recreation, Adult Education and Citizenship with the Ontario Department of Education. He then rejoined the RCAF in 1952, as a Special Education Officer with the rank of Wing Commander. His mandate was to establish a directorate and trade for the development of physical fitness, sports and recreation. In 1956 he hired researcher Bill Orban and directed him to devise a program which emphasized the developments of a high level of fitness, but would consume only a relatively small amount of the RCAF personnel's time. Orban's insight was that short bouts of vigorous exercise could be just as effective as longer bouts of moderate exercise for improving fitness. He came up with five basic exercises, four to improve flexibility and strength and one to boost aerobic fitness; none required any equipment at all. The result was the internationally renowned 5BX Program. J. K. Tett retired from the RCAF in May, 1965. He became the first full-time Director of Parks and Recreation for the municipality of Kingston. In 1971, he urged the city to purchase a former brewery and distillery built by James Morton (Canadian businessman) in the 1820s, a lakeside site which he envisioned as a community arts complex. Sadly, John K. Tett died before he saw his vision come to fruition. He was reported missing in late August 1974, after his canoe overturned during a storm on Devil Lake, in Frontenac Provincial Park north of Kingston; his body was recovered two weeks later and was buried in the Tett Family cemetery in the village of Newboro, Rideau Lakes township. Kingston's limestone heritage building became known unofficially as \\"the Tett\\", and decades later, a development partnership between the city and Queen's University led to its rebirth as the Tett Centre for Creativity and Learning.

It is not to be confused with the Westhoughton Greyhound Track, which was another track in nearby Westhoughton. Origins and opening The stadium was built in an area of Bolton known as Burnden, very close to Burnden Park. The site was the former location of the Great Lever Colliery. The stadium opened on Saturday 10 December 1927 and was named Raikes Park after the nearby Raikes Hall and Farm. A stand was constructed on the west side of the stadium. Terraces and kennels were built alongside Raikes Lane to the south with further terracing constructed on the east side. Initially, racing at the track was independent: that is, unaffiliated to a governing body. Greyhound racing In 1932 the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS) was formed as a rival to the National Greyhound Racing Club, including Bolton as one of its founding members. The new organisation was established to assist the interest of promoters of mainly northern tracks. When the BGTCS was disbanded, Bolton reverted to being independent. After World War II, a neighbouring chimney being demolished by steeplejacks fell and landed on the greyhound tracks kennels causing significant damage. Fred Dibnah witnessed the event watching from the allotments south of Raikes Lane; motivated by the event he became a steeplejack. In 1958, the track switched once again to NGRC racing for a short period before reverting to independent status soon after for a third time. In the 1960s, the track had a 440-yard circumference with distances of 313, 535, 745 & 980 yards, and raced on Wednesday & Saturday nights at 7.45pm. It was considered the leading independent track and introduced an independent Derby over 535 yards which was one of the biggest events in the independent calendar. Track bookmaker Herbert Westwell was chosen to open the new £10,000 extension in 1969 as reward for his long service at the track. In 1977, the track's fifty year anniversary was celebrated by the Bolton Greyhound Racing Co. Ltd at a special meeting; 'The Jinx' won the first race (a handicap). In the 1980s Monday nights were added to the schedule during summer months and the track was converted to all-sand with an inside hare. Facilities included sixty kennels and three bars and a main stand. Speedway speedway ran for two years in 1928 and 1929 and there is also evidence of stock car racing. Final years and closure In 1987 the track was sold to developers, but this decision was overturned in 1990. Under the supervision of Racing Manager Peter O’Dowd, one last attempt at NGRC racing was made in May 1995, but racing only lasted until 23 December 1996. The stadium was closed and demolished and the site today is land between car dealerships.

History The original church of St Peris was to the south-east of Llanberis and as the town expanded a new church was required. The foundation stone was laid on 3 January 1884 by Captain N.P. Stewart of Bryntirion. The building was funded by the Assheton Smith family, which owned the rights to the slate quarried at nearby Dinorwig. It was designed by Arthur Baker of 14 Warwick Gardens, Kensington, London, a pupil of Sir George Gilbert Scott. The medieval font from St Peris was transferred here. The walls were built of local stone, with dressings of red stone from the quarries of Guest and Son, Runcorn. The construction cost was £5,455 (). The building was dedicated on 24 June 1885. Harold Hughes enlarged the church in 1914 with the addition of the Lady Chapel, on the church’s north side, and the completion of the nave.

Life Born in the City of London on 28 April 1773, he was the fifth surviving son of John Wilkinson (1732-1779), a wealthy businessman, and his wife Sibella Berdoe (1737-1807), daughter of his father's business partner John Berdoe. It is possible he was named after Jacob Wilkinson, a friend and maybe business associate of his father. Living all his adult life outside Bath, Somerset, he became a keen collector of fossil remains of extinct creatures found in the area. In 1801 he acquired a huge mammoth tusk 2.4 metres (8 feet) long, together with other remains from the same site. These he presented to the Geological Society of London, who in 1807 made him one of their first honorary members. In 1805, he found the skeleton of an ichthyosaur at Weston, Bath. By 1811 he was reported to have perhaps the finest private collection of fossil bones in England, which he was glad to show to visitors. As well as his scientific pursuits, when Britain was threatened by French invasion in 1803 he joined the Bath Forum Volunteer Infantry, in which he was commissioned as a Captain. In 1840 he gave land for founding a school, which was still flourishing in 2016 as St Stephen's Primary School.

Beall) was a businesswoman, philanthropist, and world traveler from Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. Although her philanthropic ventures were numerous and spanned her lifetime, Givin's most discernible contribution was her funding of the Amelia S. Givin Free Library in her hometown of Mount Holly Springs, Pennsylvania.  Early life and family  Givin grew up with her family near Mount Holly Springs, Pennsylvania, where her father, Robert Givin, and her uncle owned a paper mill. However, in 1865, when Amelia was about age 20, the Givin's house burned down and they moved to Carlisle, PA. Robert Givin was a respected and prosperous businessman and banker, acting as president of both the Mount Holly Paper Mill and the Farmers' Bank in Carlisle. Besides Amelia, Robert and his wife Sara (Gibson) Givin bore four sons, David, James, Samuel, and Robert. When her father died in 1879, thirty-three-year-old Amelia took over his role in running the family mill business. Less than a decade later in 1887, Amelia's mother died and Amelia inherited from her father's large fortune.  Community involvement  Besides meeting the needs of her business, Givin spent much of her time traveling and participating in social pursuits. She and her family were often mentioned in the Carlisle's local newspaper, and Amelia and her mother were both members of Carlisle's Second Presbyterian Church. After Carlisle's Cumberland County Chapter was organized in 1895, Givin became a member of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution. In her later years, Givin frequented the library she had helped to form. In addition to, and as part of, her social activities, Givin dedicated a significant portion of her life and funds to charitable pursuits. In particular, Givin supported the Carlisle Hospital, the Female Benevolent Society of Carlilse, as well as the Second Presbyterian Church of which she was a member. She included in her will $30,000 for the maintenance of Carlisle Hospital. Givin also left provisions for her household employees and many family members and friends after her death.  Amelia S. Givin Free Library  When Givin was in her late forties, she provided funding for building a free public library in Mount Holly Springs. For members of late 19th-century charitable women's organizations, libraries, in particular, were seen as important institutions for bringing edification to needful communities. To bring improvement to populations with little access to books, free public libraries, often traveling libraries or other informal libraries, such as those located in women's clubhouses, abounded between 1870 and 1930 through the work of civic-minded women. The library of Ms. Givin was far from informal, however. Begun in 1889 and dedicated on January 2, 1890, it had the modern conveniences of electric lights and hot water heating, as well as a fashionable Romanesque Revival structure and ornate interior design. The library took close to $500,000 to build and Givin also provided an endowment.  Marriage  On June 2, 1892, a few years after the library opened, the 46-year-old Givin married Walter Beall of Cumberland, Maryland. To start off their honeymoon, they rode a special car on the Cumberland Valley Railroad on the first leg of their trip to Europe together. They never had any children. Walter died in 1905 and Amelia close to ten years later at age 69. They were both buried at Ashland Cemetery in Carlisle.

History The facade of the Convent of Santo António oriented to the Garden of São Lázaro Exterior facade of the convent/public library Entrance to the cloister of the convent In 1747, a hospice was founded in the city of Porto to the invocation of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Our Lady of the Conception), by the Minor Reformed Friars of St. Francis, or Capuchos of the Province of Conceiçaõ. Two years later, a chapel was constructed by Dionísio Verney in the field of São Lázaro, that was later acquired by the religious friars for the hospice. Between 1779 and 1780, Queen D. Maria I conceded to the Franciscans authorization to found a Regular Hospice in the city of Porto. On 26 November 1780, António José Mendes Guimarães sold the \\"public chapel with mystical houses with it\\" and other lands and houses in the field of São Lázaro, to the Franciscans. The community of Franciscans of the Province of Conceição transferred from the houses of Rua de Santa Catarina to the building in São Lázaro on 30 November 1780. On 26 May 1781. there was a petition by the municipal council to occupy the land of São Lázaro to continue the services of a religious hospice. In 1783, the convent of Santo António was founded in São Lázaro, by the religious minor reformed friars of St. Francis. The convent building was not yet concluded (although the fountain in the cloister dates to this period) when in 1789 Father Agostinho Rebelo da Costa indicated the building was would be the largest convent in the city. In two years time the hospice became a convent and capital house. In April 1809, the convent began to operate as a hospital for French troops during the Peninsular War and then on 20 May designated for Portuguese troops. In July 1831, the convent was abandoned by the last religious friar and occupied by English troops supporting the Liberal monarchy. On 9 July 1833, the Real Biblioteca do Porto (Royal Library of Porto) was established by decree of King D. Pedro, which was initially lodged in the Hospício de Santo António do Vale da Piedade, Cordoaria and the Episcopal Palace of Porto. In 1834, the religious orders were extinguished, even as the convent had not been concluded. Temporarily, the Museu Nacional dos Reis (National Museum of the Kings) stored their collections in the dependencies of the former-convent, with access coming from the cloister. The creation of the Escola de Belas Artes do Porto (Porto School of Fine Arts), by Passos Manuel, resulted in the use of the convent's terrace for their activities, and the institutions move in 1836. Provisionally, in September 1836, the Royal Library was open in the Episcopal Palace. The former-convent of Santo António was donated to the Municipal Council of Porto on 30 July 1839, resulting in the move of the Royal Library. On 4 April 1842, the Royal Library was definitively installed in the former hospital. Between 1929 and 1932, Hispano-Moorish azulejos from the Convent of Santa Clara, in Vila do Conde were moved to the public library. In addition to the diverse basis for the library's collection (manuscripts, special editions, etc.) the public library became a depository for many azulejo tiles from religious convents, which were collected in the entrance to the cloister. Among the panels saved were those from the second-half of 18th century, from the Convent of São Bartolomeu of Coimbra, another two from the refectory from the monastery of São Bento da Vitória,Quaresma (1995) the Convent of Santa Clara and the Monastery of São Bento de Avé-Maria.Santos (1979), p.109 Architecture A view of the fountain constructed in 1783 The arches of the cloister The building is located in an urban area, inserted in an area of 18th century buildings in front of the public garden of São Lázaro. The remnants of the Franciscan convent are conserved in the dependencies and cloister that connect various bodies of the structure, even as the convent's church was demolished. The convent dependencies and cloister function as elements to connect various bodies, volumes covered in tiled roofs. The facades are plastered and painted white, with cornerstones in granite. The principal facade, oriented to the west, include two-storeys separated by granite friese, mezzanine and tile, that encircles by staggered granite base and topped by cornice, overlaid with frieze and protruding eaves. The first register includes 17 guilhotine-style windows with arched lintel, framed in granite centered by principal door with granite arch. The second floor has 8 rectangular windows, dual-door and flag, that includes framing surmounted by frieze and cornice, protected by ironwork. Over the windows are smaller two-leaf windows, framed with granite. Along the mansard roof are 7 windows, covered in tile. The lateral left facade is divided into three pains with the left decorated with friezes and triangular frontispiece, crowned by plinth and marked with square frame. The central section has two windows, followed by two windows similar to the principal facade. In the lateral right section there are two windows on the ground, three windows on the second register and three simple, windows on the third.

Reiter) is a professor and associate chair of anthropology at New York University, specializing in gender and health; the politics of reproduction; science, technology, and genetics; and disability in the United States and Europe. She has contributed over 80 published works to the field of anthropology, independently, as a co-author, editor, and foreword-writing, including Robbie Davis-Floyd and Carolyn Sargent's Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge. Her 1999 book,Testing Women, Testing the Fetus: the Social Impact of Amniocentesis in America, received multiple awards upon release and has been praised for providing \\"invaluable insights into the first generation of women who had to decide whether or not to terminate their pregnancies on the basis of amniocentesis result\\". She co- authored many articles with Faye Ginsburg, including Enabling Disability: Rewriting Kinship, Reimagining Citizenship, a topic the pair has continued to research.  Education and career  Rapp received her PhD from the University of Michigan in 1973 after completing her Bachelor's (with honors) and master's degrees from 1964-1969, each in Anthropology. After obtaining her PhD, Rapp continued her academic career at the New School For Social Research from 1973-1998, where she chaired the Anthropology department and founded and chaired the Graduate Program in Gender Studies and Feminist Theory. She published Testing Women, Testing the Women in 1999 after fifteen years of field work during her time there. In 2001, Rapp became a professor of Anthropology at New York University, acquiring the role of Associate Chair of the Department in 2010. She served on the Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association from 2012-2015. Rapp has spoken at multiple universities and conferences around the United States and Europe, including the University of Texas at Austin, University of Kentucky, and the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics. Rapp has also acted as mentor and advisor to feminist anthropologists Khiara Bridges and Elise Andaya. Rapp believes \\"there is 'a widening chasm' between the medical-scientific utopian dreams of human perfectibility and the public's understanding of human diversity and impairment\\". Her work in both genetics and reproduction has resulted in extensive research into multiple reproductive technologies, including amniocentesis and non-invasive prenatal diagnosis tests. Rapp stresses the \\"highly stratified and gendered benefits and burdens\\" these types of technologies carry and the audience they are marketed to. Rapp has extended this work to examine how human disability intersects with prejudice, diversity, and \\"discrimination based on racial-ethnic, class, national, religious, and gendered backgrounds\\". Her current project is projected to concern the relationships between neuroscience, disability, neurodiversity, familial structures, and activism.  Work with Faye Ginsburg  Rapp's work with long-time coauthor Faye Ginsburg focuses on disability, reproduction, science, and social structures. Their most recent work, \\"'Not Dead Yet': Changing Disability Imaginaries in the 21st Century\\" examines the continuation of eugenic thinking and how it intersects with disability and public consciousness. The pair have also explored \\"disability consciousness and cultural innovation in special education\\". Rapp and Ginsburg's previous work, Conceiving the New World Order: The Global Politics of Reproduction brought together multiple articles with the purpose of placing reproduction at the center of social theory. In that collection, Ginsburg and Rapp recall Shellee Colen's idea of \\"stratified reproduction\\", which they define as: \\"The power relations by which some categories of people are empowered to nurture and reproduce, while others are disempowered.\\" Karen-Sue Taussig identifies the importance of reproduction in anthropology and points out the highly gendered nature of this discipline: in the collection, 28 of the pieces are by females with 2 male co-authors. Carolyn Sargent has praised the collection for \\"effectively [tracing] the intersections between global dynamics and local cultural logic and social relations.\\" Similarly, anthropologist Robbie Davis- Floyd claimed that the work \\"marks the maturation of the anthropology of reproduction\\" and identified it as one of the most important works in the field of reproductive anthropology at the time. The work has also been identified as highlighting the intersections between reproduction, kinship, the body, and sexuality.  Influence and critical reception  Towards an Anthropology of Women (1975), which Rapp edited under the name Rayna Reiter, brings together articles that examine the historical structures that influence gender and inequity across cultures, but does so without trying to prove the universality of womanhood, according to June Nash. Nash views the collection as simultaneously promoting the study and understanding of both women and anthropology. In 1999, Rapp published Testing Women, Testing the Fetus: the Social Impact of Amniocentesis in America, which Adele Clark describes as \\"[making] significant and enduring contributions to...sociology and science and technology, medical sociology and anthropology, research methods, women's studies, feminist theory, clinical genetics, medicine, [and] nursing.\\" The book examines the effects of the routinization of fetal diagnosis and analyzes its cultural and social significance in a U.S. context, positing that pregnant women's experience with amniocentesis is deeply influenced by gender, race, and class.

Paskoje belongs to the branch which produced three chancellors in the Ragusan government, and one notable poet. The other branch was involved in trade. Their coat of arms with a sun and three stars can be found in the Church of the Holy Mother of Mercy and in front of the house of M. Jakšić. Paskoje's father was Pripčo Dobreljević (1400–1466). Paskoje had sons Trajan, Niko and Luka, all of whom became scribes. Trajan and Niko were both Serbian scribes, in the period of 1527–36 and 1536–66, respectively.

Primojević requested a guarantee from the Ragusan government to not allow other printing houses to be opened in Ragusa for the next 15 years.

One year later Luka requested for extension of this period for another eight months, which was also accepted. Still, for some reason, he failed to establish printing press.

Zdenka Buben (1895 – 1988) was an American public health social worker that pioneered the development of many professional standards. Early life Buben was born in Paris, France in 1895. Her mother did not like France, and thus her father suggested that they move. When Zdenka was two, Buben's father's friend arranged for Buben's father to transfer his work to New York, where the Buben family lived until 1908. In 1908, they moved to San Franscisco, where Buben finished high school. She went on to attend the University of California at Berkeley, where she originally majored in music.\\"Miss Zdenka Buben\\" Pacific Coast Musical Review (April 3, 1920): 8. She switched her major to Hygiene, a department where people were trained as somewhat nurse and somewhat social work trainees. and went on to graduate and become a Health Visitor for the city of Alameda. Afterwards, her title changed, and she became a public health nurse in Los Angeles. Career Buben joined the Council of Social Agencies in its Health Division. She eventually helped work toward establishing a school of social work in Los Angeles, and also established a Bureau of Social Work in the Los Angeles County health department. At the time, many private medical doctors were against publicly funded medical care, and the Health Department also feuded with doctors about who should exactly receive care. Despite being the chief medical social worker in her department, Buben actually did not have a degree in social work until she decided to do so in the 1940s. She went on to attend the University of Chicago and obtained her Master's degree in Social Work. Afterward, she returned to Los Angeles and returned to her old position as the Director of Public Health Social Work, and maintained that position until her retirement in October 1961. Throughout her career, she advocated for the development of professional standards. Some of her lasting legacy of practices are the development of a sliding scale of fees for indigent persons who wished to receive medical care; the development of numerous social work training schools; and connecting many social agencies, the Health Department, and medical providers with one another. Buben also was a proponent of preventative care for diseases that are preventable, particularly tuberculosis and smallpox. She also lobbied for standards for social work and better licensure practices. In recognition of her significant contribution to social work, Buben was inducted to the California Social Work Hall of Distinction.

Life and work Magnus' memoirs, published after his death, were notable for igniting a long- running feud between two of the most distinguished expatriate English authors, D.H.

Just before his suicide (to avoid arrest for debt), Magnus had made Douglas his literary executor, but the memoirs in their original form were unpublishable. They duly appeared, in edited form, with a long introduction by Lawrence, whose name helped to sell the work.

History=Early years Perkins grew up in Fairborn, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton. During his earliest years, his family lived on Titus Avenue in Dayton's Northridge neighborhood, a few houses from Guided By Voices frontman Robert Pollard. Perkins has stated that his proximity and early exposure to Guided By Voices was influential, noting that Pollard's lo-fi production technique and uninhibited vocal approach gave him the confidence to \\"make weird sounds\\" with his voice. Perkins was also influenced at a young age by The Beatles, particularly the album Magical Mystery Tour, as well as singers Van Morrison, Roy Orbison, and Patsy Cline. In 2002, Perkins began experimenting with a Tascam Portastudio 4-track cassette recorder and amassed a catalog of original songs. He later referred to this formative material as \\"garbage,\\" citing the negative influence of Top 40 radio on his writing. 2007-2013 In 2007, Perkins' early psychedelic material was discovered by MGMT, who later offered him a touring support slot at the time of their debut release, Oracular Spectacular, on Columbia Records. However, Perkins declined due to anxiety. Later that year, he produced a full- length record under the pseudonym of The Esther Caulfield Orchestra. This album, called Good Morning, Whiskey Breakfast, included contributions from Joseph Sebaali and Andrew Gabbard of Buffalo Killers and was described as a \\"potent cocktail of thrilling, 60s-inspired psychedelia.\\" Good Morning, Whiskey Breakfast was made available through Perkins' website as a free download, with only 25 hand-made copies of the album on CD made available for purchase. During this time, Perkins worked as a roadie for Buffalo Killers on their tours in support of The Black Crowes, and he has referred to this experience as his \\"formal introduction to the music industry.\\" In 2011, all three members of Buffalo Killers acted as Perkins' backing band for a period of time before he retired his Esther Caulfield Orchestra moniker in order to form his new group, called Goodbye. For this new project, Perkins recruited the members of West, a group fronted by Kelley Deal of The Breeders. After Deal put the group on hiatus in anticipation of The Breeders' 2012 reunion tour, drummer Ian Kaplan, guitarist Nick Eddy, and bassist Chris Green began rehearsing and performing with Perkins as Goodbye. Goodbye produced a full- length record, entitled Cheerio!, however Perkins reportedly spent over 5 years revising the album before ultimately deciding that it would not be released. Present After the death of Chris Green in 2014, Perkins disbanded Goodbye and began working on new solo material at his home in Dayton's Belmont neighborhood. These new songs would form the basis for Perkins' first official release. SofaBurn Records approached Perkins with a recording contract in 2015 after Zach Gabbard presented the company with a collection of material by The Esther Caulfield Orchestra and Goodbye. In January 2016, Perkins recorded the drum tracks for the forthcoming SofaBurn release at Gabbard's analog studio, Howler Hills Farm. The remainder of the album's instrumentation was completed by Perkins at his home studio. Perkins' debut release was announced after the song \\"Humboldt County Green\\" premiered in High Times in July 2016. The album, called M Ross Perkins, was released by SofaBurn on October 14, 2016. Initial critical reception of the record was enthusiastic, with Record Collector calling it \\"a truly great album\\" and others drawing notable stylistic comparisons to solo artists such as Harry Nilsson and Emitt Rhodes. After touring in support of the debut record, Perkins produced a follow-up EP entitled What Did You Do For Summer Break. SofaBurn released the album in streaming format on August 31, 2018. Critics noted a shift to \\"a more sophisticated and precise,\\" pop-oriented writing style throughout the EP. Brooklyn music critic Jack Rabid, publisher of The Big Takeover, described the album as \\"dreamy\\" and dubbed Perkins the \\"Brian Wilson to Pollard's Pete Townshend.\\" While promoting the EP, Perkins performed the song \\"Amazing Grace (Grandma's Dead)\\" on the Jerry Springer Podcast, with Springer and producer Jene Galvin calling it the best song ever performed on the show. In 2019, Perkins announced the release of \\"Gabbard & Perkins,\\" a full length collaboration album with Andrew Gabbard of Buffalo Killers. Perkins is sponsored by Höfner Guitars and plays a rare 1967 Höfner model 4578 signed by Sérgio Dias of Os Mutantes.

Buch), and also known as the indicator group book or identification group book was a secret distribution list in booklet form, which listed trigraphs in random order. The Kenngruppenbuch was introduced in May 1937, and used by the Kriegsmarine (German War Navy) during World War II as part of the Naval Enigma message encipherment procedure, to ensure secret and confidential communication between Karl Dönitz, Commander of Submarines (BdU) in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean operating German submarines. The Kenngruppenbuch was used in the generation of the Enigma message Key that was transmitted within the message Indicator. The Kenngruppenbuch was used from 5 October 1941, for the Enigma Model M3, and from 1 February 1942 exclusively for the Enigma M4. It must not be confused with the Kenngruppenheft which was used with the Short Signal Book (German: Kurzsignalbuch). History The Kenngruppenbuch was a large document with the first edition coming into force in 1938, that mostly remained unchanged when a second edition was released in 1941. The Zuteilungsliste, however, was continually updated. After 1 May 1937, the Kriegsmarine had stopped using an Indicating system with a repetition of message key within the indicator, a serious security flaw, which was still being used by the Luftwaffe (German Airforce) and Heer (German Army) at the beginning of 1940, making the Naval Enigma more secure. The introduction of the K Book was designed to avert this serious security flaw. On 9 May 1941, when a version of the K Book was recovered from U-boat U-110, Joan Clarke, and her compatriots at Hut 8, the section at Bletchley Park tasked with solving German naval (Kriegsmarine) Enigma messages, noticed that German telegraphists were not acting in a random way, which they were supposed to when making up the message Indicator. Rather than selecting a random trigram out of the K Book, the telegraphist had a tendency to choose a trigram from either the top of the column list, or near the bottom and grouped in the middle. It was a problem that the Kriegsmarine later corrected with the introduction of new rules, later in 1941. Design Early copy of the Zuteilungsliste. Notice how additional Naval Enigma ciphers have been added at a later date. The Kenngruppenbuch consisted of two main parts. The first half consisted of the Column List (German:Spaltenliste) which consisted of all 17,576 of trigrams (Kenngruppen), divided into 733 numbered columns of 24 trigrams displayed in random order. The second half consists of the group list (German:Gruppenlist) where the trigrams are sorted in alphabetical order. After each trigram are 2 numbers, the first giving the number of the column in the Spaltenliste in which the trigram occurs, the second giving the position of the trigram in the column. The table pointer, or table selection chart (German:Tauschtafelplan) told the operator which column of a given table was used to select the required trigrams. By means of the Assignation list (German:Zuteilungsliste) told the radio man which table he should use for a particular cipher net. Large keys would be given several blocks of columns, small keys as few as 10. Copy of heavily revised Tauschtafelplan Naval Enigma Operation Naval Enigma used an Indicator to define a key mechanism, with the key being transmitted along with the ciphertext. The starting position for the rotors was transmitted just before the ciphertext, usually after having been enciphered by Naval Enigma. The exact method used was termed the indicator procedure. A properly self-reciprocal bipartite digraphic encryption algorithm was used for the super-encipherment of the indicators (German:Spruchschlüssel) with basic wheel settings The Enigma Cipher Keys called Heimische Gewässer (English Codename: Dolphin), (Plaice), Triton (Shark), Niobe (Narwhal) and Sucker all used the Kenngruppenbuch and bigram tables to build up the Indicator. The Indicator was built up as follows: Two Trigrams were chosen at random. The first trigraph was taken from the Key Identification Group table (German:Schlüsselkenngruppe), from the Kenngruppenbuch as determined in the Zuteilungsliste. The second trigraph was taken from the encryption indicator group or Process characteristic groups table (German:Verfahrenkenngrupp),also taken from the Kenngruppenbuch and also determined in the Zuteilungsliste.

It was also a short lived greyhound racing track from 1928–1934. Origins The stadium is believed to have opened on the site of an old farmers field around 1890 when Bournemouth F.C. moved into the ground. The club continued to be the sole users of the ground off Namu Road until 1928 when a greyhound company took ownership of the site. History=Football The ground was also known as the Victoria Park Sports Ground in later years but has remained the home of Bournemouth Football Club throughout. Greyhound racing The first meeting took place on Saturday 23 June 1928 following an earlier failed venture by the same company at nearby Ensbury Park Racecourse. There was six race card but both hurdle races were declared void due to greyhounds fighting which was a common occurrence in the early days of oval racing. The press blamed the problems on a large bird because it was reported as flying in front of the faces of the greyhounds upsetting them. The first ever winner was Miss F Milburn’s Cabaret over 525 yards in a time of 38.30 at odds of 7–4 on. The attendance was described as large and one of the stewards was Lord Robert Edward Innes-Kerr, husband of the famous actress of the time Jose Collins who christened the dummy hare. This first meeting was held under National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) rules but it was also stated that nine previous meetings had been held by the company. These meetings mentioned however are believed to relate to the nine held previously at Ensbury Park based on the fact that the company and Racing Manager Reg Hermon were the same. The company went bankrupt before 1932 when the Southern Greyhound Racing Promotions Ltd purchased the stadium and spent £5,000 transforming the facilities. The new company also owned Banister Court Stadium which opened in 1928 so previous experience of running a track was an advantage. The Director of Racing was T Bradbury-Pratt and the chairman was Ronald Prideaux (one of the original Southampton directors). Eight thousand people witnessed the reopening on Monday 1 Aug 1932; the racing behind the new mechanical hare (patented by Bournemouth’s own Mr Mitchell) was a success and the kennel sweepstake over 400 yards was won by Mount Fergus, despite finishing second in his earlier heat on the same night. The racing schedule was set for every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday with no bookmakers allowed on course, all bets were tote only. The stadium closed to greyhound racing on 29 September 1934 for unknown reasons but the council purchased the stadium for £4,500 in 1944 leasing it back to the football club.

Early life Born in 1887 in Killeagh in County Cork to Richard Foley and Margaret Long. Her parents were Irish speakers. When she was 15 Foley was sent to school in Dublin where she joined the Keating Branch of the Gaelic League. Her siblings were already members including Nora, Cait and Micheal. The family in Dublin was running the Foley Typewriter Trading Company. In 1915 she joined the Cumann na mBan, Central Branch. Foley was involved in all the usual activities of the organisation from learning First Aid and carrying messages to carrying guns where needed. She particularly worked as a go between from Seán Mac Diarmada to her brother who worked in Birmingham in munitions. She was also involved in the return of Liam Mellows from England where he had been deported. During Holy week Foley was sent to Cork with a written dispatches for Tomas McCurtain and a solicitor Mr Healy. Foley usually refused to know what was in the dispatches so she could better react when questioned by the British. On one of the trips to Cork she was searched and detained by the police but the failed to discover the dispatches she carried. She was followed to church but evaded the detectives and managed to get her charge to McCurtain's brother. Séamus O'Connor asked Foley, with others, to transport guns stored in Arran road, Drumcondra, Dublin which needed to be moved. Kitty O'Doherty carried out the action once a number of women and men showed up to assist on the way to the location. Foley and Effie Taafe were then sent off leaving others to finally move the guns. On another occasion Foley was asked to transport sums of money for Séamus O'Connor. Revolution Once the Easter Rising began and Foley had returned to the city she worked delivering messages from the General Post Office (GPO) around the city to the various leaders and then was sent to create a first aid station. Dr Touhy arrived with the first injured volunteer. Foley was arrested on the day Tom Clarke was executed and sent to Kilmainham gaol, after processing in Ship street barracks and then Richmond Barracks, with many other women. The women spent several months in Mountjoy Prison. Foley was sent to HM Prison Lewes with four other women. She and Marie Perolz were released earlier than the rest of the women after the issue was raised in Parliament. It turned out that Foley was being charged in connection with the arms landing in Kerry. One her return to Ireland Foley began to arrange care packages for the men still held in prison. While in Kilmainham, Perolz attributed her survival to Foley as she had become very depressed listening to the executions of the leaders. During the time she was in prison, Foley's sister continued to run the typewriting business though the offices were wrecked during the rising. Their landlord refused to take rent until Foley and her brother were released. While she was in prison in the UK she was visited by Alfie Byrne MP. The five women in Lewes prison were Marie Perolz, Helena Molony, Nell Ryan, Winifred Carney and Foley. After the prisoners were released there was very little activity until the Conscription Crisis of 1918. Foley was a member of the Phibsboro Committee of the anti-conscription organisation. That reinvigorated the sense of nationalism in Ireland. Foley was present at the opening of the Dail on 21 January 1919. She continued to run the family business and provided it, her car, and the offices to the volunteers whenever needed. Her business was repeatedly attacked during the Black and Tan period. She and her husband often hid people on the run while they were living in Dublin. They were present in Croke Park during the events of Bloody Sunday (1920). As a result of the raid on the family home and the arrest of her husband, Foley was instrumental in arranging an informant, John Reynolds, within the British troops. Foley married Joseph J. Martin in June 1918. In 1925, with her husband, she moved to London. Martin died in 1963 and Foley died in 1970.

Description Zarraga studied in the Academia de San Carlos and at the age of eighteen travelled to Europe. In the Old Continent he had the possibility to get in touch with the Avant-garde group of painters that by the time were leaving in Paris. Once in the French capital, he participated in the foundation of the School of Paris together with artists such as Amedeo Modigliani and Maurice Utrillo. Even if he experimented a variety of styles, he was always faithful to his own pattern. In the first decades of the twenty century, his works were characterized by an academic cut which he later abandoned for other artistic pursuits. In this canvas dated 1922, it is possible to see how it is difficult to define his style and to collocate it inside a specific artistic movement. The brushstroke employed for the sea waves, as well as the particular relation between elements, evoke the Avant- garde influence. At the bottom right of the painting there is the signature and a dedicatory to Réne Delange [Zarraga aux Delange en toute affection (For Delange with affection)], who was an art critic that wrote the preface Dialogue over the Water [Dialogue sur l'eau] with Félix Fénéon for the Parisian exhibition Ángel Zárraga in 1921.

The original chapel consisted of a single room, with a stony façade and Gothic-style arched windows and door. The building had deteriorated significantly by the 1940s, becoming unsafe for use. By the early 21st Century only a corner of the original has remained standing.\\"Preservation Priorities\\" Cobb Landmarks. http://www.cobblandmarks.com/preservation- priorities.html The Nesbitt/Union Chapel played a significant role in the religious, social, and agricultural history of Cobb County, in addition to its association with several of the County's prominent, early families. Currently, the Chapel ruins are barely visible from the road, obscured by trees and heavy underbrush. The ruins of the Nesbitt Union Chapel, constructed of rammed earth in the Gothic Revival style, are architecturally significant for the unusual material and a style uncommon in religious architecture in rural Georgia.Stanton, Phoebe. The Gothic Revival and American Church Architecture: An Episode in Taste, 1840-1856. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997). As a center of worship, the Chapel is both unusual and significant in its inclusion of all denominations.Hill, Samuel. Religion in the Southern States: A Historical Study. (Macon: Mercer University Press, 1983) Its location three miles distant from Marietta seems trivial today, though undertaking that journey along dirt roads in a horse-drawn buggy would have been arduous even under ideal conditions. The Chapel allowed local families to worship close to home, regardless of their religious affiliation. Several Marietta congregations adopted the Chapel as a mission, rotating services for Baptist, Methodist, Episcopal, and Presbyterian parishioners. The inter- denominational nature of the Chapel reflected its group of Trustees, which included Episcopalians (Irwin and Starnes), Presbyterians (Nesbitt), and Baptists (Ward).Trope, Betsy. \\"Friends of Nesbitt Union Chapel Historic Narrative Project.\\" (Marietta, Georgia, 2016)  Land history  The earliest reference to the property—2nd Section, 17th District, Land Lot 7—is in the 1832 Gold Lottery of Georgia, when it was deeded to William Alexander. A warranty deed recorded September 7, 1882, documents a transaction between Marietta Savings Bank and R.L., possibly Rebecca Lanier, Nesbitt (Cobb County Deed Book G, p. 203). The property was deeded by Robert T. and Rebecca Nesbitt to a group of five trustees in December 1886 (Cobb County Deed Book J, p. 24). Those trustees were James G. Hughes, Robert C. Irwin, Robert T. Nesbitt, Hugh N. Starnes, and John R. Ward.Trope, Betsy. \\"Friends of Nesbitt Union Chapel Historic Narrative Project.\\" (Marietta, Georgia, 2016)  Legal history  The property legally remained in this trusteeship, as long as it was used for the purposes stated in the 1886 deed. Though the structure fell into disrepair, the trustees and local residents continued to meet and worship on the property, in an effort to hold to the original, legal document. Around 1972, the property appears in a Sheriff's Tax Deed. The tax exemption on the property had apparently been removed and taxes were reported as owed. It remains unclear how a local landowner gained control of the parcel, but property taxes were paid on the land until 2004.Trope, Betsy. \\"Friends of Nesbitt Union Chapel Historic Narrative Project.\\" (Marietta, Georgia, 2016)  Chapel site returned to the public  Some local residents still gathered and worshipped on the site until the official formation of the Friends of Nesbitt Union Chapel (FUNC), a non-profit task force of the Cobb Land Trust, in 2002. At that time, small events and services were held on the site with the intention of honoring the provisos of the 1886 deed. The FNUC undertook a lengthy legal fight with the Clarkes to regain control of the property, spurred on by the demolition in 2004 of most of the remaining structure. In 2010, Cobb Superior Court named the Cobb County Commissioners as trustees of the property, which continues to be used for educational and worship purposes, primarily by the members of the FNUC. The organization hopes to expand these functions in the future, following a rehabilitation of the site by Cobb County.Cobb Land Trust, \\"Friends of Nesbitt Union Chapel\\" http://www.frogsncats.com/clt/html/nesbitt.htm 1886 chapel building  A wood-framed, pointed-arch door with marble lintel provided entrance to the building in the center of the north façade, facing Powder Springs Road. A lancet-arch vent with wooden louvers was centered above the door. The doorway was covered by a wooden porch, with shingled, shed roof, supported by slender wood posts and brackets. The stoop, approached by two steps, consisted of stone topped with wood planks. The wood steeple was centrally positioned along the ridgeline. Its shingled roof flared out at the corners and was supported by rounded arches on all four sides. The base of the steeple was clad in board and batten siding. The steeple contained a cast iron cupola bell manufactured by Thomas Kane and Company, of Chicago, Illinois. The bell remained in situ until the mid-twentieth century. Four lancet-arch windows lined the east and west facades of the Chapel. The double-hung windows had marble sills and louvered, wooden shutters. On the south façade, two double-hung, lancet-arch windows flanked a semicircular apse protruding from the building. The interior walls of the Chapel were covered with white plaster and the floor with wood planks. At the north end, a carved pulpit stood on a wood dais accessed by two steps at each end. A wood stove probably occupied the northeast corner of the building, based on the presence of a stovepipe in several photographs. Wood pews occupied the sanctuary and were donated to St. James Episcopal Church in Marietta following the deterioration of the Chapel. Receipts and numerous personal accounts indicate that there was an organ in the sanctuary, purchased from the Estey Organ Company in downtown Atlanta, on May 12, 1881 (Fig. 12). Estey, based in Brattleboro, Vermont, was the primary manufacturer of reed organs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Reed organs were more portable than later pipe models, and therefore better suited to small churches like Nesbitt/Union. No other extant structures remain on the property, though personal accounts and oral histories mention a school on the property. In A Woman's Place: 52 Women of Cobb County, Georgia, 1850-1981, Mary Anne Irwin refers to \\"the two to three rooms of the Old Union Chapel School,\\" where she taught for over thirty years. It remains unclear whether the school was located in a separate building or classes were held in the Chapel. Another structure notably absent from the property is the privy, though personal accounts indicate it stood in the southeast corner of the property.Trope, Betsy. \\"Friends of Nesbitt Union Chapel Historic Narrative Project.\\" (Marietta, Georgia, 2016).  Developmental history  Marietta and the surrounding area were settled and thriving well before the founding of Atlanta. Chartered by the state in 1834, the town was named for Mary Cobb, the wife of United States Senator Thomas W. Cobb, for whom the county was named. As was the case with so many early Georgia communities, the railroad was the catalyst for growth and development in Marietta. The Western & Atlantic line connected Marthasville—known today as Atlanta—with Marietta in 1845. Situated at over 1000 feet above sea level and blessed with abundant natural springs, Marietta provided a cool respite from the oppressive summer weather. Hotels, boarding houses, and restaurants sprang up near the railroad to accommodate seasonal visitors. The town quickly became a popular getaway location for wealthy planters from south and coastal Georgia.Temple, Sarah. The First Hundred Years: A Short History of Cobb County, in Georgia. (Atlanta: Foote & Davies, 1966).  The Nesbitt family  Some of these summer visitors chose to relocate permanently to Marietta, including Robert Taylor Nesbitt, a descendant of one of Georgia's most distinguished families. Nesbitt's mother, Martha Deloney Berrien Nesbitt Duncan (1820-1896), hailed from Savannah, where her father, Richard Berrien, was a prominent physician. He died in an 1820 yellow fever epidemic when Martha was still an infant. Though she never knew her father, she was well acquainted with her uncle, John McPherson Berrien. John Berrien was a United States Senator, renowned orator and jurist, and the namesake of Berrien County in south Georgia. Several accounts describe Martha as sharing her uncle's gifts for elocution and civic engagement.Temple, Sarah. The First Hundred Years: A Short History of Cobb County, in Georgia. (Atlanta: Foote & Davies, 1966). Martha was related to another of the state's most prominent families through marriage. Her stepfather, General Robert Taylor, was one of Georgia's wealthiest planters, owning estates in Savannah and Morgan County, totaling over 17,000 acres at the time of his death. He built his summer home in Athens, a Greek Revival mansion known as the Taylor-Grady House, now designated as a National Historic Landmark. Martha married her first husband, Hugh O'Keefe Nesbitt, in this home in 1839. Like Martha Berrien's father, Hugh Nesbitt was a physician, though he gave up his practice to manage her considerable plantation holdings in Early County. The couple purchased a home from Judge David Irwin in Marietta in 1852, though Hugh Nesbitt died shortly thereafter. Martha remarried in 1861, to Dr. William Duncan of Savannah. Following his death in 1879, she split her time between the home of her granddaughter in Griffin and her son's Marietta estate, Farm Hill, where she became an influential figure in local social and civic circles.Temple, Sarah. The First Hundred Years: A Short History of Cobb County, in Georgia. (Atlanta: Foote & Davies, 1966) Robert Taylor Nesbitt (1840-1913) assisted in the management of his family's plantations from an early age, taking on greater responsibility after his father died when he was fifteen. Following his service in the Confederate Army, Colonel Nesbitt married his fiancée, Rebecca Lanier Saffold (1845-1937) in Madison, in 1865. He continued to manage the family holdings in South Georgia until the lingering effects of a bout with diphtheria and the rigors of his military service took their toll. Records indicate that Nesbitt acquired his Marietta property, called Farm Hill, on December 30, 1881, settling there permanently for the benefit of his health. Robert Nesbitt served in the State Senate and as the State Commissioner of Agriculture from 1890 to 1900. He wrote a monthly column, \\"Mr. Nesbitt's Monthly Talk,\\" in the Marietta Journal, focusing on different crops and agricultural issues. Nesbitt died in 1912, and was buried in the Episcopal Cemetery following a service in the Union Chapel. Rebecca, the daughter of Mary Harris Saffold and William Oliver Saffold, was born in Madison. After donating the land and Chapel to the trustees, Mrs. Nesbitt played the organ in the Chapel. She served as the first president of the Kennesaw Chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy. She is also buried in the Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta. As early as 1852, the Nesbitt's were acquainted with another leading Marietta family, the Irwins, who sold them their first property in the area. Judge David Irwin (1807-1885) was a self- taught lawyer, admitted to the state bar at twenty-one before opening a practice in Madison. Irwin moved to Marietta in 1835, eventually accumulating a sizable estate in the area. In addition to serving in the State Senate, Irwin was the first judge elected to the newly created Blue Ridge Judicial Circuit. Despite his lack of formal legal education, Irwin made a significant, lasting impact on Georgia's judicial system, as one of three commissioners appointed to prepare a code of laws for the state. Along with Judges Richard H. Clark and Thomas R.R. Cobb, Irwin produced a comprehensive set of statutes for the state, published in 1861.Temple, Sarah. The First Hundred Years: A Short History of Cobb County, in Georgia.(Atlanta: Foote & Davies, 1966).  The original Union Chapel deed  These two illustrious Cobb County families came together in 1886, with the formal establishment of the Union Chapel. A deed recorded on December 20, 1886, documents the transfer of a one acre parcel and building from Robert T. and Rebecca Nesbitt to a group of five trustees: John R. Ward, James G. Hughes, Robert C. Irwin, Robert T. Nesbitt, and Hugh N. Starnes. According to the deed, the Chapel was to \\"be used as a place of worship for all Christian denominations, for skools [sic] and agricultural societies and for no other purposes.\\" A chapel with an active membership clearly existed on the site prior to 1886, since the deed itself includes transfer of \\"the building known as Union Chappel [sic].\\"Trope, Betsy. \\"Friends of Nesbitt Union Chapel Historic Narrative Project.\\" (Marietta, Georgia, 2016)  The first trustees of Union Chapel  The Chapel trustees were certainly pillars of the community, though little is known about James G. Hughes and John R. Ward. While no birth or death date is recorded for Hughes, a grave in the Roswell Methodist Cemetery roughly corresponding to the correct period bears the same name. His profession and relation to the other trustees remain unknown. John Ward, the son of Thomas Jefferson Ward and Mary Jane Sorrells, was born in 1831 and served as County Surveyor for many years before his death in 1900. He was married but had no children and was buried at Midway Presbyterian Church Cemetery. Robert Cessne Irwin (1843-1921) was the son of Judge David Irwin and Sarah Baldwin Royston. He served with the Cobb Mountaineers during the Civil War, rising to the rank of Captain. In 1867, he married Mary Wills Lane of Washington, Georgia and they had six children together. Shortly after the War, Irwin was appointed Solicitor General of Cobb County, a position he held until 1891. For the last thirty years of his life, he served as clerk of the State Insurance Department. His funeral service was held at Union Chapel, before interment in the City Cemetery. Hugh O'Keefe Nesbitt Starnes (1856-1926) was born in Augusta, Georgia, to Ebenezer Nesbitt Starnes and Mary Ann White. He graduated from the University of Georgia in 1875 with a degree in agriculture. In 1880, he married Lucie Berrien McIntosh, a niece of Robert Taylor Nesbitt. After a brief stint as an attorney in Savannah, Starnes relocated to Marietta in 1882 and went to work in the business office of the Atlanta Constitution. He went on to serve as Assistant State School Commissioner and horticulturist at the State Experiment Station in Griffin. In 1898, he joined the faculty of the College of Agriculture at his alma mater. Hugh and Lucie Starnes had four children; both were buried in the Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta.Trope, Betsy. \\"Friends of Nesbitt Union Chapel Historic Narrative Project.\\" (Marietta, Georgia, 2016)emple, Sarah. The First Hundred Years: A Short History of Cobb County, in Georgia. (Atlanta: Foote & Davies, 1966)  Earlier wooden structure destroyed by fire  Anecdotal evidence and oral histories suggest that the original chapel was a wooden structure destroyed by fire. This supposition is supported by several announcements in the Marietta Journal in July and August 1886, marking a fundraising effort for the rebuilding of the chapel. An October 1886 article in The Southern Cultivator and Dixie Farmer provides additional details, stating: \\"strange to say, at the beginning of this year, the chapel was once more destroyed by fire.\\" The author goes on to celebrate the energetic fundraising of the women in the congregation for the rebuilding effort. In addition, George W. Childs, publisher of the Philadelphia Public Ledger, donated \\"a most beautiful large Bible\\" for use in the Chapel. If the burned structure referred to in The Southern Cultivator was a chapel, it is likely that the Union Chapel existed in some form on the site well before its official endowment in 1886. Several additional facts lead to a conclusion that the 1886 deed merely formalized and gave legal standing to the existing functions of the Chapel and the roles of its leaders. The Chapel trustees are mentioned, though not named, in multiple articles predating the signing of the deed in December 1886. While no records confirm the identity of the earlier trustees, those named in the 1886 deed and members of their families were clearly previously involved with the Chapel. Two fundraising events for the rebuilding of the Chapel were held at the home of Hugh N. Starnes in 1886. Starnes' wife and Rebecca Nesbitt served on the organizing committee for the events, hosted by \\"the ladies of Union Chapel.\\"Trope, Betsy. \\"Friends of Nesbitt Union Chapel Historic Narrative Project.\\" (Marietta, Georgia, 2016)  Union Chapel and the surrounding community  Notices in the local newspapers and church records indicate that the Chapel hosted services regularly, conducted by pastors from around the country. Weddings, funerals, and christenings were also held in the Chapel. Revivals, ice cream socials, and community gatherings took place on the grounds through the first decades of the twentieth century. Some of the significant trustees and members of the congregation during this period were descendants of the Chapel founders.Trope, Betsy. \\"Friends of Nesbitt Union Chapel Historic Narrative Project.\\" (Marietta, Georgia, 2016). Mary Anne Irwin (1875- 1963), daughter of Thomas Beverly Irwin and Lilla Atkinson, was Judge David Irwin's granddaughter and niece of original trustee, Robert C. Irwin. Though she inherited a sizable plantation from her mother, Mary Anne's calling lay in education. She sharecropped the Atkinson farm, moved to her father's homeplace on Powder Springs Road, and taught school at Union Chapel for more than thirty years. Miss Irwin also wrote a social column, focused on events in the Union Chapel community, for the Marietta Journal, beginning in 1894. In her later years, she became known as the \\"Guardian\\" of the Union Chapel, for her efforts to repair the deteriorating structure and continue its use. An April 1954 article in the Cobb County Times recounted how Miss Irwin salvaged the Chapel bell and her pleas for help from the community to restore the building. Mary Anne Irwin never married and was buried in the cemetery at St. James Episcopal Church in Marietta. Robert Beverly Irwin, Sr. (1908-1987), was the son of Mary Anne's brother David Atkinson Irwin and Mildred Bishop Goodman. Born in Falls Church, Virginia, Mr. Irwin moved to Georgia as a child, where he spent summers with his family in Marietta. He practiced law in Atlanta for fifty-two years and served as the attorney for the Chapel trustees for many years, vigorously trying to clarify the ownership of the property prior to his death in 1987. He is buried in the Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta.Malone, Henry Thompson. The Episcopal Church in Georgia: 1733-1957. (Atlanta: Episcopal Diocese, 1960).  Agriculture  The Chapel was already a center of agricultural learning and fellowship by the time the deed specified its use for agricultural societies in late 1886. A notice in the Marietta Journal on May 21, 1885, refers to \\"the grounds of the Phoenix Club, at Union Chapel.\\" The history of the Phoenix Club, in which Hugh N. Starnes served as Secretary, is outlined in the October 1886 issue of The Southern Cultivator and Dixie Farmer. Written by \\"A. Phoenix,\\" the article states that the club was founded by a group of Marietta farmers in August 1883, in a meeting at Union Chapel. Furthermore, the club drew its name from \\"the fact that the chapel was erected over the ashes of an antebellum structure.\\" Herrington, Philip. \\"Agricultural and Architectural Reform in the Antebellum South: Fruitland at Augusta, Georgia.\\" Journal of Southern History 78, no. 4 (Nov. 2012), 855-86. Organizations like the Phoenix Club played an important role in rural communities during the mid-late Nineteenth Century, as part of a national agricultural reform movement. The first agricultural society in America was established in Philadelphia in 1785, encouraging adoption of new planting and husbandry methods developed in Europe. In 1811, the first American agricultural fair was staged in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, offering prize money for the winning animals and crops. Shortly thereafter, in 1819, the first specialist journal, The American Farmer was created in Baltimore, promoting innovation, experimentation, and new technologies. These events were all manifestations of the impact of the Enlightenment on agriculture in the United States. Beginning in Britain and Europe in the Eighteenth Century, the Enlightenment emphasized scientific examination and discourse and the spread of scientific ideas through societies and publications. This movement had a significant impact on the practice of agriculture and, consequently, its role in society. Large-scale farming was the mainstay of the economy in the southern United States, including Georgia. The intensive planting of cotton, in particular, on many plantations, to the exclusion of any other crops, resulted in a devastating decline in soil quality. As Georgia planters sought solutions to their dropping productivity, they turned to science and the national agricultural community. The first agricultural society in Georgia was founded in Hancock County in 1837 and the Augusta-based Southern Cultivator journal began circulation in 1843. The agricultural reform movement in the South and more broadly, across the nation, depended on a network of farmers, scientists, and publishers, disseminating information through journals, local meetings, and fairs. Agriculture clearly underpinned the lives of many of the founders of the Nesbitt/Union Chapel. Martha Berrien Nesbitt Duncan owned enormous acreage in south and middle Georgia, both through her own family and that of her stepfather, General Robert Taylor. Her first husband Hugh O'Keefe Nesbitt, abandoned his medical practice in order to manage her plantations, a job their son, Robert Taylor Nesbitt, an original Chapel trustee, would assume following his father's death. Robert Nesbitt would eventually be elected State Commissioner of Agriculture and author a monthly column on farming issues in the Marietta Journal. Another original trustee, Hugh O'Keefe Nesbitt Starnes, boasted even more impressive credentials in the field of agriculture, graduating with a degree in the subject from the University of Georgia. He was appointed horticulturist at the Griffin Experiment Station in 1892, joined the faculty in the College of Agriculture at his alma mater in 1898, and authored numerous articles and monographs on agricultural subjects. Starnes, in particular, embodied the spirit of the agricultural societies and reforms in the late Nineteenth Century and the evolution of agricultural science in Georgia. The formal study of agriculture was relatively new in Georgia at the time, having been introduced to the University curriculum in 1872, when the school was designated a federal land-grant institution. Hugh Starnes would thus have been in one of the first full classes to study agriculture at the University. In 1887, the University established the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences and, the following year, the Georgia Experiment Station in Griffin, a research facility studying soil erosion and fertilizers. Hugh Starnes would be closely associated with both institutions and the education of future Georgia farmers. In The Southern Cultivator, \\"A. Phoenix\\" notes that in 1886, there were twelve agricultural clubs in Cobb County, prompting the creation of a journal, The Phenix Agriculturalist. According to the article, the Nesbitt/Union Chapel was where \\"the most intelligent farmers of Cobb county assembled.\\" The proviso in the Nesbitt/Union Chapel deed to include agricultural societies clearly indicates the importance of agricultural education and innovation to the original Trustees.Herrington, Philip. \\"Agricultural and Architectural Reform in the Antebellum South: Fruitland at Augusta, Georgia.\\" Journal of Southern History 78, no. 4 (Nov. 2012), 855-86.

Richard Cowley Later, in 1874, a Charter of Incorporation was granted to the City of Peterborough, prompting the Council to form a Watch Committee along with the Peterborough City Police. Until 1947, the constabulary only officially used one helmet plate design, a day and a night plate, see photographs. In 1934, when flat caps were issued for officers assigned to motor patrols, the constabulary had some early badges chromed to save on purchase costs of new badges. However, it is thought that only three chromed badges were produced. The day badge (photographed), is one such chromed badge. It is also known that when Liberty badges were in short supply due to breakages, wear and tear, then identical Northamptonshire badges were used as these were in plentiful supply. At that time Peterborough and the Soke were still within the county of Northamptonshire. Compare Badges In 1914, the Constabulary had its own Special Constables but very little is known about this; only a badge exists, and it is only by the design of the badge that dating can be made.

BAHD1 is involved in heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression.  Discovery  BAHD1 was first cloned from a human brain cDNA library and the coding sequence was named KIAA0945. Bierne and colleagues further discovered the function of BAHD1 in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression.  Function  BAHD1 acts as a co-repressor by interacting with a set of proteins that promote chromatin compaction and regulate transcription. Tandem-affinity purification of the BAHD1-associated protein complex in human HEK293 cells identified MIER proteins (MIER1, MIER2, MIER3), histone deacetylase HDAC1 and HDAC2, histone H3K9 methyltransferase EHMT2, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1 alpha, HP1 beta, HP1 gamma), MBD1, TRIM28 and CDYL as partners of BAHD1. Overexpression of BAHD1 in HEK293 cells induces large-scale chromatin condensation and DNA methylation on autosomes. The C-terminal BAH domain of BAHD1 acts as a reader for the epigenetic mark H3K27me3. Ectopically expressed BAHD1 colocalizes with the heterochromatic inactive X chromosome (Xi).  Animal studies  Ablation of the Bahd1 gene in the mouse alters placental development and results in hypocholesterolemia, hypoglycemia and decreased body fat. Bahd1-haplodeficiency in mice decreases the efficiency of infection with the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.  Clinical significance  During infection of human epithelial cells with the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, BAHD1 represses interferon-stimulated genes. At specific stages of infection, a Listeria nucleomodulin, LntA, acts as an inhibitor of BAHD1 and activates interferon-stimulated genes.

History Killing Floor was formed in San Francisco by John Belew and Christian Void, with Void on both vocal and keyboard/sampler duties. The band is named after the sonic torture chamber in William Gibson's cyberpunk short-story Johnny Mnemonic. Their music was characterized by heavy use of samples and electronics over dance beats. Guitarist Marc Phillips joined the band in 1991, followed by percussionist James Basore and bassist Karl Tellefsen in early 1994. They caught the interest of the electro-industrial label Re-Constriction and were signed in mid-1994. The band issued their debut Killing Floor on March 14, 1995. The band was praised for its original balance of guitar and club music oriented material, which critics claimed made Killing Floor standout in comparison to other industrial acts at the time. Their second album Divide by Zero was released on September 23, 1997. The band recorded in a more collaborative way because they had more free time to express themselves in studio. Divide by Zero was a change in artistic direction for Killing Floor and saw the band integrating stronger elements of punk and electronic into their music, which drew them comparison to grunge. The band released their final release, the single Come Together, in 1998. The band ceased activities shortly thereafter.

Cataño was the son of Jesús Cataño Flores, a photographer from Tepic who drew as a hobby, and Flora Wilhelmy del Real, the daughter of a German sailor who had settled in Sinaloa. Cataño demonstrated a fondness and talent for painting at an early age. He moved as a young man to Mexico City, where he produced vignettes, covers, and caricatures. He studied visual arts at the Academy of San Carlos. With his almost Victorian upbringing, he cut a gentlemanly figure and was known as a great conversationalist, a connoisseur of art history, a poet, and a lover of Mexican colonial architecture. He married the well-known writer and activist Margarita Michelena, who bore him two children: Andrea and Jesús. In his early years at Galas de México, Cataño designed the label for Corona beer, which is still in use. For his paintings, he did preliminary research and worked from photographs that he took himself in Mexican villages: he portrayed ideal models of men and women with a romantic beauty very much in the popular taste. The introduction to Museo Soumaya's Mexican Calendars catalogue defines the colorful aesthetics of Mexican calendar art as a \\"singular combination of creativity and commercial efficacy\\". And furthermore states that: \\"Both affective and effective, the final product was multiplied in works that have persisted in the collective imagination of several generations of Mexicans, helping to define their notions of national identity, beauty, folklore, cinema, leisure, religion, esthetic taste, fashion, tourist resorts, and childhood.\\" The Galas de México calendars that were a mainstay in countless Mexican homes for decades positioned Cataño as one of the greatest artists in the genre of pin-up girls for calendars. Although the printing establishment founded by Santiago Galas had a studio where the house artists could work, Cataño enjoyed the privilege of working at home, where he created his ideally beautiful figures, often modeled after magazine photographs. It was his use of color that especially marked his vast production.

She was the granddaughter of King Andriantsoly of the Boina Kingdom, and acceded in 1881 to the throne of the Bemihisatra group of the Sakalava following the death of her mother, Safy Mozongo. She controlled a relatively small territory on the north-western coast of Madagascar consisting of the island of Nosy Be and a stretch of the mainland coast opposite. During the early years of her reign she faced the challenge posed by the ambitions of the mainland's dominant power, the Merina Kingdom. Binao allied with France when it intervened in Malagasy politics in the first of the Franco-Hova Wars between 1883–85. The war ended with France taking de facto control of Madagascar's foreign policy and recognising the Merina as the dominant native power on the island, a development that was a considerable disappointment to Binao. In 1894–95 France pursued its second Madagascar expedition against the Merina, which ended with the French taking full control of the island and establishing the Malagasy Protectorate. The Merina monarch, Ranavalona III, was exiled to the French colonies of Réunion and later Algeria. Binao supported the French intervention and opposed the Menalamba rebellion against the French two years later. She was confirmed by the French as ruler or gouverneur principal of Nosy Be, which had effectively been converted into an internal protectorate within colonial Madagascar under the French politique des races (a form of divide and rule). Relations with the French deteriorated dramatically in 1918 when a serious dispute arose over the legitimacy of levying corvée labour under the traditional practice of fanompoana, in which Sakalava subjects paid their respects to their deceased ancestors and reconfirmed their loyalty to the monarch. Binao had been required to obtain French permission for work on the royal tombs but she had sought to evade it by sending a request which was timed to reach the colonial authorities after the work had already begun. The plan failed and resulted in reprisals against subjects who participated in the fanompoana and against Binao herself, who was evicted from her doany (royal palace) and made to pass it on to her half-brother Amada. She was forced to live instead in the town of Hellville (now Andoany), inflicting a humiliating blow against the monarchy. Amada succeeded her as king on her death and reigned until 1963.

Description Central panel The Last Supper is the theme of the central panel of the altarpiece, commissioned from Bouts by the Leuven Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament in 1464. All of the orthogonals in this composition display an understanding of linear perspective.J.M. Collier, Linear perspective in Flemish painting and the Art of Petrus Christus and Dirk Bouts, Diss. University of Michigan 1975, Ann Arbor 1977 The lines lead to a single vanishing point in the center of the mantelpiece above Christ's head, though outside the room, the small side room has its own vanishing point, and neither it nor the vanishing point of the main room falls on the horizon of the landscape seen through the windows. Dieric Bouts was not a native of Leuven. He moved there from Haarlem and his Last Supper was the first Flemish panel painting of its kind. In this central panel, Bouts has introduced the idea of a group portrait around a table, a theme known to council members in Haarlem. Christ is depicted larger than life in the role of a priest performing the consecration of the Eucharistic host from the Catholic Mass. The men around him are shown a half-size smaller, and probably are accurate portraits of prominent members of the confraternity. Bouts was not the only artist traveling between Haarlem and Leuven. While he was working on this triptych, the church was still being built and the architect Antoon I Keldermans was the same man hired by the Haarlem parish. File:20091017 leuven stpierre01.JPGSt. Peter's in Leuven seen from the southwest File:Cornelis Gerritsz Decker - Bavokerk van de Oude Groenmarkt - FHM OS-66-332.JPGSt. Bavo's in Haarlem seen from the southwest Bouts main contribution to Flemish painting was his introduction of everyday details in the main panel such as the houses on the other side of the market square that can be seen through the windows, and the servants dressed in modern clothing beyond the central scene around the table. Although once identified as the artist himself and his two sons, these servants are most likely more portraits of the confraternity's members responsible for commissioning the altarpiece. This painting was copied by Aelbrecht Bouts, who disregarded the architectural elements through the windows, because by that time the church and the town square had changed. Leuven had built a new town hall, for which Dieric also made a large panel as an allegory of justice. File:Aelbrecht Bouts - Last Supper.jpgLast Supper by Aelbrecht History The work was documented by Leuven archivist Edward van Even in 1870 and lent to his friend James Weale for his 1902 Exhibition of Flemish Primitives in Bruges.Van Even, Edward, (1) Louvain monumental, 1860, and (2) Louvain dans le passé et le présent,1895 p. 328 The Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament has four additional panels, two on each side. Because these were taken to the museums in Berlin and Munich in the 19th century, the reconstruction of the original altarpiece has been difficult.(Dutch with French summary) R.

The Nazis seized The Last Supper in 1942. Panels from the painting had been sold legitimately to German museums in the 1800s, and Germany was forced to return all the panels as part of the required reparations of the Versailles Treaty after World War I.

She was one of the leading figures in the development of concrete art and non-figurative art in Uruguay. She was a co-founder the Grupo de Arte No Figurativo.  Early life  Freire was born in Montevideo, Uruguay.  Career  From 1938 to 1943, Freire studied painting and sculpture at the Círculo de Bellas Artes, Universidad del Trabajo del Uruguay in Montevideo under José Cuneo Perinetti, Guillermo Laborde, and Severino Pose, and then at the Consejo de Educación Técnico Profesional under Antonio Pose. She began to explore modern artistic languages by studying African masks and precolumbian art. In 1946, she began exploring abstraction, using flat forms and also making mobile sculptures in unconventional materials. When she met José Pedro Costigliolo in 1952, they were both exploring similar artistic styles. The couple married, shared studio space and traveled together. They were cofounders of the Grupo de Arte No Figurativo. In 1953, she visited the 2nd São Paulo Art Biennial, where she came into contact with other contemporary artists of the time. She learned of the work of European painters Piet Mondrian, Theo Van Doesburg, and Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart among others, which led to the consolidation of her abstract language. In 1957, Freire and Costigliolo were awarded the \\"Gallinal\\" prize which allowed them to travel to Europe where they studied at the Stedelijk Museum and at the Louvre Museum with Bernard Dorival and André Varagnac. In 1966 she returned to Europe to continue her studies. From 1962 to 1973, Freire was the art critic for the newspaper \\"Acción\\" and taught drawing and cultural history at the Architecture School in Colonia del Sacramento, where she met the artists Rhod Rothfuss and Gyula Kosice, key artists of the Madí Movement. Freire was also in touch with the group of abstract artists around Aldo Pellegrini in Argentina and felt great affinity with concrete and neoconcrete artists in Brazil, like Amílcar de Castro, Lygia Pape, Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica, but her work developed its own characteristic style. Freire tended to work in series, taking colors, rhythms and forms as their own subjects. From 1958 to 1960, Freire developed the series “Sudamérica” (South America), in which she used polygons in a reductive palette. In following years she experimented with a more expressive palette and symbols, which resulted in the series \\"Capricorn\\" and \\"Córdoba\\". In the series \\"Vibrante\\" (Vibrant), developed from 1975 to 1985, the emphasis was on light and color. In the early 1990s she started on a series \\"El oro de los tigres\\" (The Gold of Tigers) in which dark structures were placed on yellow backgrounds. By the late 1990s, the geometry of her work was characterized by the sensuality of color. From 1954 to 1992, Freire had 17 solo exhibitions in Montevideo, Buenos Aires, São Paulo, Río de Janeiro, Barcelona, Bruselas and Washington. She took part in many group exhibition and international biennales. In 1966 she represented Uruguay in the 33rd Venice Biennale. As of 2000 she made a number of large-scale public sculptures. The lifelong partnership with Costigliolo was such that their work tends to be considered almost as a unit. Costigliolo's death in 1985 was a great loss to her. Freire's career was among the longest of any Uruguayan artist and she is a central reference for geometric art in the Río de la Plata region.

After the necessary permission was granted the plant was put into operation on 15 September 1902,Technical on line library about 20 years later than the first commercial electricity production in the World. Technical details The first plant was a low output dynamo which was driven by a watermill on Berdan River. Its output was only 2 Kw.Uğur Pişmanlık: e-book Tarsus ve barajları Soon the primitive water mill was replaced by a turbine from İtalo Sulssera. The output increased and some of the more important streets were electrically lighted. But even then, only a few houses could use electricity. Moreover there were no switches and the dynamo operation was halted during the nights. There was no electricity meter and the consumers were making their payments on the number of electric bulbs they used. Aftermath During the First World War, a second plant was established and after the war, the municipality sold the plant to a private firm. According to a research by Professor Hamit Serbest, after many handovers the plant building was used as a fertilizer factory.

It has been around on Windows-based mobile devices since camera hardware was included on those devices and was introduced on Windows PCs with Windows 8, providing users for the first time a first-party built-in camera that could interact with webcam hardware. It is similar in structure and features to the iOS and Android Camera apps. Photo capture Camera can capture standard photos, videos, and \\"living images\\", which are similar to animated GIF images. It supports 16:9, 4:3, and 3:2 aspect ratios and offers square, rule of thirds, golden ratio, and crosshairs alignment frames, which are disabled by default. Video capture selections can be taken with detail levels of 640 × 360 pixels/30 frames per second, 1280 × 720 pixels/30 frames per second, or 1920 × 1080 pixels/30 frames per second. Flicker reduction and video stabilization can also be enabled. Photos and videos are saved by default to the Saved Images folder of the Pictures library in File Explorer, but users can change the storage location. Camera's captures include location information if the user provides the app permission to use it. Additional settings included in the app include time delay, zooming, focus control, sensitivity control, white balance control, shutter speed control, brightness control, and a toggle for switching between different cameras. For instance, most Windows phones and tablets have both front- and rear-facing cameras, so Camera's switch button toggles between the two options.. Introduction Camera was introduced to Windows Mobile in 2000 and Windows PCs in late 2012. Prior to its introduction, there was no built-in tool for using built-in PC cameras or connected external webcams, although some manufacturers included third-party camera software on devices they sold. On Lumia Windows 10 Mobile devices, it is the only camera as Microsoft discontinued support for the custom Lumia Camera apps. Issues Because Camera only uses the hardware camera, not a screen capture utility, its functionality is hardware-dependent. While all current Windows phones have at least one camera, not all desktop Windows computers have one. Camera does not have some of the features of the iOS app, such as slow-motion videos, a 1:1 photo ratio, and filters. However, all of these effects can still be added to already-created photos and videos by editing them in Photos. Camera does have a panorama capture feature similar to iOS’, but only on phones. Microsoft launched a free camera app named Pix exclusively for iOS devices, despite already having its own mobile platform and Camera app. Pix has a different set of features than either Windows Camera or iOS Camera.

They wanted to introduce tampons to the German market, but the cardboard used for the applicator in the American tampon product Tampax, which at the time dominated the market, was unavailable in post-war Germany. Hahn and Mittag approached Karl Julius Anselmino, director of the Landesfrauenklinik women's hospital in Wuppertal for advice on its design and development. He told them that the job required a woman and recommended the young gynecologist Judith Esser. Esser's finished design went into production in Wuppertal in March 1950.

He was one of the central members of Novemberists, a group of Finnish expressionists. Collin was born in Helsinki in educated, Swedish-speaking family. His father was a civil servant. Becoming an artist was not obvious for Collin. He studied law, but did not want to become a civil servant in Finland as A Grand Duchy ruled by Russia. He worked as a journalist, and tried to study architecture, but the mathematics classes were too challenging for him. Then he changed his studies to study art, first in Helsinki later in Paris. He made four elongated trips in continental Europe, and on his fourth visit to Paris he enrolled in Académie Ranson where he was taught by Paul Sérusier. Sérusier drew his attention to composition, and for a while even the use of colour in Collin's work shows influence of Sérusier. The paintings of life in archipelago painted in bright colours were Collin's final breakthrough as an artist. Collin became a member of group of artists led by Tyko Sallinen. The group took later the name November Group. In middle of 1910-decade the group started to use more ascetic palettes, and the colour scale of Collin was the most minimal of them all. He only used a few dark shades. After 1921, Collin gradually abandoned his gray and brown palette by adding more bright colours. When he became older, his style became more realistic. Collin is known for his paintings of people. Many of these illustrate literature, such as the Aleksis Kivi novel Seitsemän veljestä or the Miguel de Cervantes novel Don Quixote. He portrayed factory workers and farmhands as faceless representatives of their social class. Collin was given an honorary title of professor in 1953.

History Facade of Santa Maria in Via Facade of Santa Maria in Via The church was designed at the site of former small oratory, acquired by the Cardinal Angelo Giori between 1639 and 1642. In 1643, the Cardinal acquired a venerated 13th- century image of the Madonna and Child attributed to the Master of Camerino. The Cardinal commissioned Andrea Sacchi to design the church, consecrated in 1654. The layout is elliptical with four lateral semicircular chapels. The chapel of the crucifix and a baptistery occupy the anterior chapels, while towards the apses is the oratory of the confraternity and the sacristy, opening to the aedicule with the icons of the Virgin. The icon was restored in 1973. The icon has writing in gothic letters stating “Virgo parit Christum velut angelus intimat ipsum”.One translation: the Virgin gives birth to Christ as the angel shares. The original brick ceiling collapsed during an earthquake in 1799, and was replaced by trussed roof. The interior is decorated with faux polychrome marble (scagliola)and completed only in 1896 by dall'Adami of Rome and the Ferranti of Tolentino. The church was damaged again by the 1997 earthquake and reopened for worship in September 2006. The nave ceiling was frescoed by Giuseppe Rinaldi, known as lo Spazza, and depicts the Life and Mysteries of Mary. The presbytery was painted by Orazio Orazi, depicting the icon of the Madonna and Child of the Master of Camerino putatively arriving from Smyrna (Izmir) and its coronation. In the chapel to the right, was once the tomb of Cardinal Giori, it now houses the crucifix with which in 1750, St Paolo della Croce, founder of the Passionists, blessed the people of Camerino, while promulgating his eremitic monastic mission. The paper mache crucifix was derived from a Chapel in the Strada di Beldiletto. St John the Baptist by Valentin de Boulogne Cardinal Giori originally aimed to endow each of the four chapels with three master paintings. Ultimately, many of the paintings are copies of Baroque masterworks. In the first chapel on right, the paintings depict Saints Francis of Sales and Paola by Andrea Sacchi. The Second chapel has a copy of the altarpiece of St Michael Archangel by Guido Reni.The original Reni painting is in the church of Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini in Rome, with another copy in St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.

Both its brushstroke and geometric figures allows us to ascribe this canvas to the Cubism. This oil painting depicts a young lady looking at a cherry pie in an intimate scene. The dominant tones cover the scale of red. The lady is watching the cake with her eyes closed in a proper position. The Artist The artist was part of the Group without a group [grupo sin grupo], as the art critic Teresa del Conde used to place him. This expression was coined by the writer Xavier Villarutia and it is due to the fact that it was very difficult to define the artistic movement Zárraga belonged to. What is true and can be said of his entire production is that he refused to create art with a politic or social theme. Between the different styles he practiced, the Cubism was one of the most interesting. He had a prefect knowledge of the art movement as he had the possibility to study and appreciate it during his stay in Paris. The artist Pablo Picasso referred to him with this words: I had a Mexican friend who I loved very much. An intelligent, fine and knowledgeable man. He was even a painter [...] Ángel Zárraga. A gentleman. When Ángel Zárraga died in 1946, the writer Salvador Novo wrote in his column Novedades [News]: He was characterized by a European prestige, even greater when he came back[...] He made no concessions to the art tendencies he found when he came back to his country. The painter returned to Mexico in 1941 sent to the inhabitants of Durango, his original city, a message: My friends, people from Durango, this faith of mine, this hope of mine, are the only gift I bring to you, because my works on canvas and walls are despicable things and therefore perishable. What is immortal, are the faith and the hope in my Indian Mexico, Spanish and catholic, and in my Indian Durango, Basque and catholic.

Both versions are dated c. 1425, and are in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin and Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid. The Madrid panel was in a Belgian private collection and not widely known about until 1957. The panels were first exhibited alongside each other at the National Gallery, London, in 1961. The panels are considered of equal quality and by the same hand, i.e. one is not a workshop copy of the other. However, the existence of two near identical paintings from such an early and renowned master has excited art historians as to their commission, dating, and providence. The portraits are renowned for their close and realistic observation of the subject's features. They lack any attempt at flattery or idealisation, instead the sitter is depicted as he probably was; overweight, with a long, straight nose and pronounced nostrils and a \\"fleshy, unbecoming gaze\\".Connolly, 56 However the portrait cannot be viewed as satire, mocking or judgmental. The man has an alert appearance and intelligent, reasoned eyes, and the close cropping against a light coloured background seems deliberate, probably intended to convey the weight of his personal presence and charisma. The sitter's identification as Robert de Masmines (c. 1387–1430/1), a Burgundian knight and governor of the County of Hainaut, was suggested by Georges Hulin de Loo, based on the man's similarity to a named portrait attributed to Jacques Leboucz from the 16th-century Recueil d'Arras manuscript. However, this theory is neither conclusive nor widely accepted. ReferencesSources * Connolly, Anthony. Painting Portraits. Crowood, 2012. * Kemperdick, Stephan. The Early Portraits.

Olga doesn't give him any free time and he is tired of it. The last drop comes when Olga's father voluntarily ends his life. Jan realizes that the life of his father in law was controlled the same way as Jan's is. Jan knows that he will end up the same way. Jan pretends that he suffers from Alzheimer's disease and is put in Psychiatric hospital which is headed by his friend who gives him freedom. Only Jan's son Jakub and son in law Erik know the truth. Erik is married to Jan's daughter Olinka who is pushed by her mother and grandmother to control Erik's life the same way as Olga controls Jan's life. Pepík on the other hand is happily married to Alena who is quite opposite to other women in family and gives Pepík his free space. Their only problem is that Pepík can't have children. Erik and Jakub are secretly meeting Jan at weekends to enjoy some time together. This makes the women suspicious and Olinka enables an app in Erik's mobile phone which sends coordinates to her. This leads to the revelation of the truth and Jan returns home. Erik is angry at Olinka and leaves home. Olinka then realizes the wrongs of her mother and grandmother when she hears Jan telling that his wife ruined 40 years of his life and when she sees Pepík and Alena happy. Jan decides to divorce Olga and leaves home. Olinka decides to help him and provides him a houseboat that belonged to Olga's father so that Jan has a roof over his head. This helps her to repair the relationship with Erik. Olga is then seen bitterly giving lecture about divorced men being unable to be happy while divorced women are being able to enjoy life. The closure shows the contrast of her lecture with reality as Jan is shown at last being happy and enjoying his time with Erik and Olinka as they toast in honor of Jan's father in law.

Built in 1927, it is a particularly rare example of Art Deco architecture in Portland, the only one known by the noted Maine architects John Calvin Stevens and John Howard Stevens. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history The former Schlotterbeck and Foss building is located on the north side of Portland's downtown area, at the southeast corner of Preble and Kennebec Streets. The building is a five-story masonry structure, with a concrete frame and an exterior of buff brick with cast stone. The ground floor is finished in cast stone, while the upper floors are primarily brick with stone trim. The central three bays project slightly, and the main entrance at its base is sheltered by a metal canopy supported by chains. The building corners also project in the manner of pilasters, and have decorative Art Deco details in the top level. Its facade is topped by a low parapet with stepped caps at the corners.Hanson, Scott (2016). NRHP nomination for Schlotterbeck and Foss Building; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission. Arthur Schlotterbeck, a German immigrant, established a pharmacy in Portland in 1866. In 1887 he was joined by Charles Foss, a Maine native, and the two embarked on the production of patent medicines, which were primarily marketed as remedies for a variety of female health issues. In 1892 they branched out into the production of flavored extracts for cooking. This build was designed for them by John Calvin Stevens and his son John Howard Stevens, and was completed in 1927. It is a rare surviving industrial design by the elder Stevens, and is the only known Art Deco design by the team. Its interior, designed for the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of the company's products, is also rare as a significantly unaltered example of period factory architecture, both inside and out.

Under his leadership, the All Souls Church became a center of social activism, with a racially balanced congregation.  Early life and education  Eaton was born in Washington, D.C. After graduating from Dunbar High School, he earned a bachelor's degree in 1954 from Howard University. He earned his S.T.B. and M. Div. degrees at the Boston University School of Theology. Eaton served as a Second Lieutenant with the newly integrated Fourth Infantry Division in Germany in 1954. He was ordained a Methodist minister in 1957. In 1961, Eaton returned to Washington, D.C. as the Methodist chaplain for Howard University, where he later served as registrar.  All Souls Church  In 1969, Eaton became the minister of All Souls Church, which then had a primarily white congregation, although the neighborhood was becoming predominantly black. Eaton was not only the first black minister at All Souls but of any large UU church. Eaton was a close advisor to Washington mayor Marion Barry, one of the church's congregants. One of Eaton's first sermons, a May 1970 critique of Nixon legislation that would allow police to invade homes without knocking, stoked widespread controversy. The sermon, entitled \\"Take the Blindfold Off the Lady: The D.C. Crime Bill,\\" included the line: \\"If this legislation is passed, I suggest to you and instruct myself . . . [that] any time persons break into your house unannounced, shoot them!\\" He went on: \\"In order to understand true morality, one must understand that oppression must be stopped at all cost.\\"  Non-church activities  Eaton was a long-time at- large member of the District of Columbia State Board of Education, serving from 1981 until his death.

His fame led to his inclusion in Leonard Wilson's 1916 book series \\"Makers of America: Biographies of Leading Men of Thought and Action\\".  Beginnings  Babington was born August 25, 1869 in Lincoln County, North Carolina to Elisha Babington and Margaret Isabelle Haynes. Elisha Babington was a foundryman and builder, in fact, Babington was born at a site called Reinhardt's furnace, a vestige of the charcoal-powered iron industry that flourished in North Carolina's Southern Piedmont and was being replaced by cotton mills and the railroads as the 19th century expired. One source connects his father's line to an old foundry and bell-casting enterprise in New Jersey after an unknown Babington immigrated from England. His mother's genealogy contains North Carolina planters and one Revolutionary Veteran Robertson Goodwin permitting Babington entry into the Sons of the American Revolution while his maternal uncle was the sheriff of Lincoln County.  Career  He was educated in Charlotte, North Carolina at Macon High School before moving to Winston Graded School and Boys Male Academy in Winston, NC and Salem, NC, respectively. Aged 17, he began work as a railroad agent and a telegraphic operator. Over the course of thirteen years in the industry he received several promotions. A keen follower of new inventions, he started working with telephones in 1895 and built the first independent lines in his region of North Carolina. These included a line between the Depot of the Seaboard Air Line Railway, the Post Office, and his own home in Mount Holly, North Carolina. Mt. Holly's first telephone exchange, which he built, started with twenty subscribers and linked the cotton mills, the railroad, the post office, the drug store, etc. Babington would later invest in industries like cotton and the railroads. In May 1899, he resigned as a railroad agent and telegraphic operator to move to Gastonia, North Carolina and begin a telephone business. Starting this time with sixty four subscribers, he expanded his new network into over seven counties and over the border into South Carolina. Babington-Love Interests, his trademark, eventually absorbed the first telephone system of Gaston County built by Henry M. McAden in McAdenville, North Carolina. Shifting away from the engineering aspect which he self- described as tolling \\"cost[ing] blood sweat\\", he became the Assistant Treasurer, General Manager, and Director of the Piedmont Telephone and Telegraph Company and as time passed, Vice President and Director of the Armstrong Cotton Mills Company, Director of the Gaston Loan and Trust Company, and Director of the First National Bank. A popular figure, he was also elected Alderman of Gastonia. After a few years, Piedmont Telephone and Telegraph Company was acquired by Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company where he continued to work until June 1933. Commiserate with being a leading citizen, Babington bought the second automobile in Gastonia in 1904, a Locomobile Steamer, costing $675 which he frequently toured around the town as pictured in one newspaper clipping in front of the Falls House, where crowds used to await trains. The Falls House of Gastonia would later become the site of Babington's Armington Hotel erected in 1914 and opening August 31, 1915 for $75,000 This building, which was named by combining Babington and his principal partner's last name, Armstrong, was subsequently destroyed in 1959 and today the lot is a railway overpass. Characteristically, every room was to have telephone service. Until then, a far more altruistic project was on his mind, a North Carolina Orthopaedic Hospital.  Philanthropy  Babington read in 1909 about an orphanage that didn't have the financial means to accept a crippled child in its institution. His reaction was immediate: \\"\\"I made a vow then and there never to rest until North Carolina had some place to foster and care for her other unfortunate and destitute children. I dreamed about it that night; the vision would not pass\\". The project, presented to the Commercial Travelers Club of Charlotte and chartered on April 9, 1914, was ambitious because it would constitute the first orthopedic hospital south of Philadelphia and local subsidies were rare at the time. He wanted the healthcare to be free, for the latest surgical techniques to be employed, and for the hospital to be a home for crippled children. After Babington studied orthopedics and lobbied the State for most of a decade, the North Carolina General Assembly appropriated $25,000 in 1917 for the construction of the school provided a portion of the funds could be matched locally. A woman named Lena Rivers was crucial in convincing the Assembly before the vote. Babington brought the local fundraiser to fruition bringing in $10,000 from Gastonia and $5,000 from Charlotte businessmen and opened the North Carolina Orthopaedic Hospital (NCOH) on July 1, 1921 on 26 acres between the two urban zones. The State pledged additional funds ($7,500 per year) for upkeep, Gastonia provided free water and electricity, and local business planned holiday celebrations for the patients. One notable surgeon was Oscar L. Miller and a year after Babington died, a notable visitor was Franklin D. Roosevelt when the institution had 160 beds, all filled. Coincidentally, the hospital heroically responded to the polio epidemic of the 1940s. Early on, NCOH accepted black children and in 1966, the institution was integrated. It was only in 1979, when crippling diseases were rarer, that the services were absorbed by other hospitals, within Duke University, and Wake Forest University. A few years after opening the hospital, Babington probably exhausted, left for a tour of the world in 1923.  Family life  Babington married the same year his father died, at only 18 years of age on February 22, 1888, Buena Vista Biggerstaff with whom he had children Robert Kenneth, Raymond and John (died in infancy), and Mildred. Widowed by Buena Vista in 1897, he married again, this time to Hattie A. McLurd, and fathered Merle (died in infancy), Mary Love, Robin Benjamin (R.B. Jr.), Isabel Macauley, Harriet Maupin, and Ruth. Kenneth studied electrical engineering and would become a frequent business partner of his father's and later his biographer while R.B. Jr. was called to the insurance business with his uncle Mr. E. G. McLurd. Babington's interest for children is manifested in his 1909 calling to create a school for handicapped children. He also provided the first free park for children in Gastonia. His mother, Margaret Isabelle died in Charlotte in June 1916 after a lifetime of community involvement that manifestly influenced her son. Finally, many member of his family were masons and while he became affiliated with all the Masonic bodies, including Blue Lodge, his grandmother Catherine Sweet Babington (died 1886), had been the only female mason in America, inducted into the Blue Lodge because she had spied on their meetings. Babington died on November 28, 1935 from an illness at age 66 and was buried on his hospital's grounds.  Further reading  *Angus M.

The iconic, red sandstone, based course was designed by two architects, Dr. Michael Hurdzan and Dana Fry, and officially opened July 15, 1999. Dundarave has hosted golf legends Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson during the 2006 Making the Connection - Legends of Golf event. The Dunadrave Golf Course shares the practice grounds and clubhouse with its sister course Brudenell River Golf Course.  History  Dundarave Golf Course official opened on July 15, 1999 after being delayed for about a month. The delay in opening of the course was a result of the dry weather which caused the grass to grow in slower than expected. The course was designed by two different award-winning architects, Dr. Michael Hurdzan and Dana Fry. It was designed as an expansion to the Brudenell River Resort and is intertwined throughout its sister course Brudenell River Golf Course. In 2007, the provincial government began looking to sell the Dundarave Golf course, along with the other three courses it owns. The reasoning behind the decision was the large expenditure of taxpayer money on course maintenance, losses from the four courses totaled $858,900 in the 2014-2015 golf season. Tourism Minister Robert Henderson was quoted saying \\"Obviously, when you’re on the floor of the estimates [committee] … and you’re saying you invested in this stuff, sometimes comments get made that maybe that would have been better spent on an X-ray machine or books,\\" in relation to the government's decision to sell the courses. As of the 2015 golf season no sale had been completed and the course is still maintained by the provincial government.  Course  The course is an eighteen-hole championship golf course that is located on the Brudenell River. Dundarave golf course is among the top courses on Prince Edwards Island, it is rated the 37th best golf course in Canada and has been rated 4 1/2 stars by SCORE Golf. It was designed to exhibit the uniqueness of Prince Edward Island's red sandstone and has a particular bunker pattern containing 120 different red sand bunkers. The fairways on this course tend to be wide, while the holes snake through the woods and along the Brudenell River.  Events = Making the Connection - Legends of Golf  In 2006 Dundarave golf course hosted the Making the Connection - Legends of Golf, an event created by IMG Canada and Tourism PEI in conjunction with The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada to raise awareness of high cholesterol and the risk of heart disease and stroke. The event took place on June 19-20th and featured a playoff between legends of golf Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, along with a long drive exhibition by Jason Zuback. The event was broadcast both nationally and internationally while be commentated by PGA colour commentator David Feherty and PEI golfer Lorie Kane.  2016 P.E.I. Amateur Golf Championship  From July 15 to July 17 Dundarave golf course hosted the 2016 P.E.I. Amateur Golf Championship.

It is 2 m wide and 1.4 m tall. Although it was previously thought that it was an oil painting on canvas, tests revealed that the artist used acrylics. In comparison with the mural, on this version the artist suppressed the horse, leaving both the guerrero águila (Eagle Warrior) and the Spanish conquistador kneeling face to face, embracing and killing each other.  Interpretation  The title is a metaphor for how the conquest was perceived: the artist shows two cultures embracing and merging, while the two traditions collide and destroy each other.

History The castle was first mentioned in 1273. Although the origins of the Ostrý Kameň castle are not clear, it is believed that it was built in the 13th century. The goal of building this royal border fort on the western border of the Hungarian Kingdom was the protection of the important trade route connecting Buda with Prague in the Middle Ages, the so-called Czech Road. This trading route passed the barrier that the Little Carpathians posed via the depression of the valley Bukovská Brázda situated directly below the castle. Originally a royal property, the castle was passed into private property in 1366 when it came in the hands of Hungarian feudal families. In 1394 Stibor of Stiboricz became the owner of te Ostrý Kameň castle. After his noble family died out the castle was in the hands of different successive owners. At the turn of the 15th and 16th century the castle became the hereditary property of the brothers Imrich and Martin Czobor. At that time the castle served no longer as a guarding fort but rather as the economic and defensive center of a much larger estate. In the spring of 1539 Imrich's son, Gašpar Czobor, died and left behind a wife with five children and a substantial debt to the Bakič and Révay magnates families. A feud over the ownership of the castle started between the three families, which was complicated by marriages between the different families and investments by the Bakič family in the renovation and completion of the castle. The trial to settle the feud was only ended in 1554 after the direct intervention of emperor Charles V. Four years later the three families divided the estate between themselves: half of Ostrý Kameň stayed with the Czobor family, the other half was given to the Bakič and Révay families. The Ostrý Kameň estate was ultimately split at the end of the 18th century due to more marriages, feuds and other transactions. In the end it became property of the Pálffy family who transferred the seat of the estate to Moravský Svätý Ján. As no one was interested in the restoration of the castle which was already damaged during the Rákóczi's War of Independence, the castle slowly started to fall into decay. It was also the time when Buková and surroundings suffered from passing armies on the trade road as well as local robbers. Robbery flourished especially in the first half of the 18th century with one of the legendary robbers being Hrajnoha. Architecture The original castle was actually a small fortress situated in the northern part of the castle area. It was located in the topmost spot of the rock ridge and was protected by steep precipices from which it obtained its later name Sharp Stone. An oblong building joined together with a prismatic tower with an entrance gate formed the original fortress. Gradually a forecastle with auxiliary buildings and a water cistern were added to the castle. At the turn of the 15th to the 16th century the safety of the castle was increased by building a bulky fortress in the foreground, on the rock behind the moat. With the increasing risk of Ottoman raids the Ostrý Kameň castle was expanded with a second forecastle with a circular corner bastion. In the second half of the 16th century additional forecastles were added. Today only some fragments of walls of three bastions are left although there were also auxiliary buildings, residential buildings, storerooms, a bakery and a forge erected on the castle grounds. Flora The castle area and the rocks surrounding it are an important area for the occurrence of relict flora.

It was released in April 2017, and is based on the Dark Souls video game series by FromSoftware and Bandai Namco Entertainment. A successful crowdfunding campaign raised over to fund the development of the project. Gameplay Dark Souls – The Board Game is a miniature-based exploration board game that can be played cooperatively with up to four players. Players assume the game role of characters based on classes from the Dark Souls video game series and fight monsters and seek treasure. The game uses miniatures to represent players, mini-bosses and bosses. The miniatures are modelled after player characters and enemies of the video games Dark Souls (2011), Dark Souls II (2014), and Dark Souls III (2016). The miniatures move on a node-based game board. Combat is card-based; bosses have a set of \\"AI\\" cards that determine their movement and attacks. A unique aspect of gameplay is that your health and stamina share the same bar, limiting your ability to move and attack when you have taken damage. Stamina regenerates at 2 points per turn, whereas damage requires healing at the bonfire checkpoints, or use of healing items. To create different experiences each playthrough, players lay down random tiles and then draw encounter cards for each tile; encounter cards determine the enemies, terrain items and traps that spawn on that tile. Once players reach a boss, they choose a number of AI cards and shuffle them, then set aside a further \\"Heat Up\\" card. Players reveal the boss' AI cards in order without reshuffling until the boss drops below a certain amount of its total health points. The \\"Heat Up\\" card is then shuffled into the AI deck, giving the boss a new stronger card and changing the order in which it will attack for the remainder of the fight. Development Dark Souls is an action role-playing video game series developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Dark Souls – The Board Game is an officially licensed board game based on the series. It was created by UK-based company Steamforged Games. In 2015, designer and co-founder of Steamforged, Mat Hart, had been prototyping dungeon crawler tabletop games. He disliked the reliance on luck and repetitive nature of these games, so he sought to address these issues. Hart met with a friend, who was employed at Bandai Namco as a video game producer. Bandai Namco itself was eager to find a board game design that could translate the Dark Souls series into a new format. Before pitching their ideas to Bandai Namco, Hart and his team analysed the series to identify key aspects and find out which elements could make the transition to a board game format. Hart felt that the project he was currently prototyping shared some of the same design philosophies embedded in the Dark Souls series. The success of Steamforged's medieval fantasy football tabletop game, Guild Ball, contributed to them acquiring the Dark Souls license from Bandai Namco. The designers at Steamforged began rebuilding Hart's prototype as Dark Souls product. The biggest design challenge that Steamforged faced was trying to incorporate the high level of difficulty that the Dark Souls series is known for while maintaining an enjoyable board game experience. The design team was given full access to resources of the series so that they could replicate the tone and aesthetics. Initially, they found it difficult to decide what content should be included in their board game adaptation; they wanted to bring iconic bosses and enemies from all three games in the series. Designer Rich Loxam believed that the use of miniatures would appeal to players by helping to immerse them in the fictional universe. On 19 April 2016, Steamforged launched a crowdfunding campaign on the website Kickstarter, seeking £50,000 to create the game.

Duhart's work was profoundly influenced by Le Corbusier's and Walter Gropius' theories, with whom he collaborated in several projects.  Biography = Youth  Emilio Duhart's family immigrated from the French province of Labort, in the French Basque Country, to southern Chile. He lived in France during his infancy and basic education. He started a relationship with Raquel Echeverría, who would later become his wife; they had four children and several grandchildren.  Professional career  In 1935, Duhart started his Architecture studies at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (PCUC), and graduated in 1941. In the same year he started working on rural populations in Chillán, affected by the 1939 earthquake. In 1942 he moved to the United States, where he studied Architecture at Harvard University. In 1943 he graduated under the supervision of architects Walter Gropius and John M. Gauss. He later served as Gropius' assistant and as Konrad Waschmann's assistant at General Panel Corporation Prefabricated Housing. During this stay at Harvard, Duhart became acquainted with the Modern Architecture movement that would become a cornerstone in his career.  Career in Chile  Duhart returned to Chile at some point in the 40s, he worked along Sergio Larraín García-Moreno-- founder of the Chilean Museum of Precolumbian Art,-- in several architectural projects: housing, industrial buildings and urban planning, among others. Besides his work as an architect, Duhart also worked in academia and union matters. In 1946 he was elected counselor at the National College of Architects in Chile, and in 1951 he returned to the PCUC to work as a teacher where he would later become director of the Urbanism, Housing and Planning department. In 1952 Duhart received a scholarship at the Institut d'Urbanisme in the Sorbonne University, and during his stay he worked with Le Corbusier in several architectural projects at the Indian cities of Ahmedabad and Chandigarh. Duhart also studied at the Centre Technique du Bâtiment, in Paris.

The coup was launched against the government of President Fradique de Menezes, and was led by Major Fernando Pereira. The coup leaders claimed that they had acted to overthrow the government to help stop poverty in the region. Background The island nation experienced political instability previously. Just months before the 2003 coup attempt, President Menezes dissolved Parliament over disagreements related to issues of presidential power. The situation was resolved after negotiations between both sides which produced an agreement to carry out reforms by 2006. Coup details President Menezes was out of the country, on a private trip to Nigeria when the coup began on July 16. The coup was led by members of the Christian Democratic Front, (a political party without seats in Parliament). It had included many volunteers in the South African 32 Buffalo Battalion. The coup started with soldiers taking control of strategic sites and arresting Prime Minister Maria das Neves and the Oil Minister, the Prime Minister having suffered a heart attack from the gunfight in his home. Although the coup had affected São Tomé, it had not affected the island of Príncipe. In a press conference, Pereira claimed the poor living conditions of those in the military drove him to rebel. Aftermath Negotiations between the government and the coup leaders began on the second day of the coup. The rebels accepted to relinquish control provided that they received amnesty from the government and that an election be held and a new government take office. South African diplomats were involved in the negotiations with the 32 Buffalo Battalion involved in the coup.

It is among his most popular compositions. The composition is written for six musicians playing a number of percussion instruments. Background Chávez was approached in the 1930s by the avant-garde composer John Cage, who asked whether Chávez could compose a piece for the percussion ensemble that was touring with Cage. The 12-minute piece was completed in 1942, in time for Cage's West Coast tour. However, the ensemble was unable to perform the piece, due to the challenging sustained drum rolls in the opening measures. The Toccata was eventually premiered in 1948 by the Orquesta Sinfónica de México, the orchestra which Chávez founded and conducted. Eduardo Hernández Moncada, however, had already conducted a premiere on October 31, 1947, with members of the orchestra of the National Conservatory.Roberto García Morillo, Carlos Chávez: Vida y obra, Tierra Firme (México: Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1960): 117. . In 1952 Xavier Francis choreographed the Toccata for the Academia de la Danza Mexicana, under the title Tóxcatl. Scenery and costumes were by Miguel Covarrubias, and the principal dancers were Xavier Francis, Raquel Gutiérrez, and Elena Noriega. The title refers to one of the eighteen fixed festivals of the Aztec calendar, celebrated in the fifth month of each year in honor of Tezcatlipoca (the \\"smoking mirror\\" or \\"mirror of fire\\").Roberto García Morillo, Carlos Chávez: Vida y obra, Tierra Firme (México: Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1960): 119. . Structure The Toccata is composed for 2 snare drums, Indian drums (1 small and 1 or 2 larger ones), 2 tenor drums, bass drum, claves, maraca, 2 suspended cymbals, large and small gongs, 2 tubular chimes, glockenspiel, xylophone, and 3 timpani, distributed among six players. It is in three movements, played without a break. The Toccata was one of the first major pieces written for percussion ensemble alone, becoming a cornerstone in rhythmic music. Originally, a toccata was a fast, virtuosic composition. However, Chávez applied the word \\"toccata\\" in its original sense, using its root meaning of toccare, or \\"to touch\\", which he used to display the various touches an artist can give a performance, rather the different lyrical shades. For the U.S premiere, during which the composer himself conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Chávez wrote in the program notes that \\"The Toccata was written as an experiment in orthodox percussion instruments – those used regularly in symphony orchestras, that is, avoiding the exotic and the picturesque. Therefore it relies on its purely musical expression and formalistic structure.\\" The first and last movements of the three-movement work are both in sonata form, during which the composer explores long, sustained rolls, and syncopated patterns. There is a passage in which the players are instructed to muffle the drums by covering the heads with a cloth or chamois. The slow middle movement emphasizes the timbres and tones of the metallic, normally atonal percussion instruments. During the movement, the glockenspiel and xylophone also play fragmented melodious strands, bringing out the composer's Mexican roots. This offers a moment of relaxed interlude before the violent final movement. The piece has been described as rhythmically ebullient, and as a brilliant study of rhythm and color, \\"creating an original climate of intense attractiveness and achieving great diversity of accents, sounds, and nuances.\\"  Cultural references  * Toccata for Percussion Instruments was used as music accompaniment for the experimental film See Saw Seams (1965) by Stan Vanderbeek. * In 1983, Jiří Kylián choreographed a ballet, Stamping Ground, to Chávez's Toccata.

Programming  The Babycastles arcade was designed to give independent game developers a public place to show their projects, and to establish such games as a social culture for New York City. The arcade was originally co-located with the music venue Silent Barn in Queens. On most nights each week, the Babycastles basement arcade of indie and amateur video games opened during music shows upstairs. The space was open for those who paid for entrance to the upstairs show. The arcade's several games and their curators rotated on a monthly basis and were set in scavenged, do-it-yourself arcade cabinets. The New York Times likened it to \\"a 1970s rec room reimagined by hackers\\". In its current Manhattan space, it remains closer in configuration to a DIY punk space than an art gallery. The venue has hosted a recurring video game tournament called Hot Ronny's Rumble. Other events and exhibitions include the 2014 book release for Julian Assange's When Google Met WikiLeaks and the 2016 \\"Yo Fight My Mans\\", curated by Ashok Kondabolu and including five weeks of art installations, live DJs, panel discussions, and a custom fighting video game.  History  Kunal Gupta and Syed Salahuddin started the Babycastles collective in 2009 in the basement of Silent Barn, a Ridgewood, Queens, cooperative performance space where Gupta lived. Following a robbery in mid-2011 and closure by zoning violations, a search began for a new space, which they opened in May 2013 in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Babycastles opened in Chelsea, Manhattan, on 14th Street in 2014. The owner of its building specifically sought to rent it to artists.

Following the release of her 1989 album Ain't Gonna Cry, Newton had concentrated largely on concert performing until the release of The Trouble With Angels in 1998. However, that album was made up largely of new renditions of songs she had recorded in the past. Thus American Girl marked her first recording of original material in twelve years. Overview Juice Newton began her recording career in 1975 but did not achieve major stardom until the release of her 1981 album Juice. The album was a crossover success and yielded three hit singles, \\"Angel of the Morning\\", \\"Queen of Hearts\\", and \\"The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)\\". The last of these peaked at number one on the Billboard Country Chart. She followed Juice with Quiet Lies (1982), an album that brought her more hits, including \\"Love's Been a Little Bit Hard on Me\\" and \\"Break It to Me Gently\\", of which the latter earned her the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. Newton's 1985 album Old Flame was her country breakthrough, spawning three number one hits \\"You Make Me Want to Make You Mine\\", \\"Hurt\\", and the duet with Eddie Rabbitt \\"Both to Each Other (Friends & Lovers)\\" and also three additional Top Ten hits: \\"Old Flame\\", \\"Cheap Love\\", and \\"What Can I Do with My Heart\\". After two more albums (Emotion and Ain't Gonna Cry) Newton concentrated more on concert performing. Newton's albums Juice, Quiet Lies, Dirty Looks, and Old Flame had all been produced by Richard Landis. In 1997 Newton reunited with him for The Trouble With Angels, an album made up largely of new renditions of her earlier recordings. American Girl was released by Renaissance Records on October 12, 1999 and was made up of twelve songs recorded over a period of eight years (May 23, 1991 - July 29, 1999). In discussing the album and her career Newton stated: :I took quite a risk pulling back my career to concentrate on my family, but I've done some other things, book narration, and learned quite a bit about that. I've written some stories and with dot.com I may just put those out myself. Might as well. We have a great web page. [Doing this album was] quite an adventure. There's quite a variety of music on it. But I've always been that kind of artist, and there are pluses and minuses to that. But that's what I do. Of the album's twelve songs, \\"Red Blooded American Girl\\" and the title track were reused from The Trouble With Angels. The rest were previously unreleased and new recordings. The only single released was \\"They Never Made It To Memphis\\". The album featured a big band swing-style number, \\"Nightime Without You\\", that Newton wrote. Among the remaining tracks were cover versions of Nanci Griffith's \\"Listen to the Radio\\", Everly Brothers' \\"Love Hurts\\", Queen's \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", and Buck Owens' \\"There Goes My Love\\". Also included was Tom Petty's \\"Keepin' Me Alive\\", which had not been released prior to Newton's version.

The club was formed in 1880, and play their home games at The Paulin Ground in Winchmore Hill. The club competes in the Middlesex County Cricket League (MCCL), notably winning the Premier League in 2012. Club History The club was founded in the autumn of 1880 as Winchmore Hill Village Cricket Club by John Moore, who was Head Gardener to the Busk family at Ford's Grove. 'Village' was dropped from the name in 1912, when the current club title was adopted. The pavilion dates back to 1922 and is a former Officer's Mess from a wartime army camp in Wimbledon. The cost of the pavilion, £1,750, was borne mostly from donations and loans by the President and members. In the 1950s, the West Indies batsman, Allan Rae, played for Winchmore Hill CC whilst completing a Law degree in England. During this time he also scored centuries for the West Indies at Lord's and The Oval. In July 1949, a tour match organised by Rae between the West Indies and Winchmore Hill was played at The Paulin Ground, featuring players such as Learie Constantine and Everton Weekes. In 2012, Winchmore Hill CC secured their maiden Premier League title in the penultimate game of the season against Ealing Cricket Club. In 2013, Winchmore Hill CC became part of Winchmore Hill Sports Club in recognition of the multi sport nature of the club.\\"About WHSC\\" Other sports played at The Paulin Ground include football, tennis, hockey and table tennis. Following the club's maiden Middlesex Premier League title, a period of poor performance followed and the 1st XI was relegated in both the 2013 and 2014 seasons to the Middlesex County Cricket League (MCCL) Division 3. In 2017, Winchmore Hill CC were champions of MCCL Division 3 and promoted to MCCL Division 2 where they have played for the last two seasons. In 2020, Winchmore Hill CC secured the Middlesex County Cricket League cup, beating North London CC in the final. [\\"Winchmore Hill vs. North London\\" The club boasts 3 cricket pitches with electronic scoreboards, high quality nets and a multi-use games area (MUGA).

She was in WASP Class of 44-W-3 as part of the 318th Army Air Forces Flying Training Detachment. She became a pilot shortly after her husband lost his life while flying, despite the fact that she had a new baby, and was the only recent widow and mother to have served as a WASP.  Early life  Chambers was born in Los Angeles, California, to Samuel Cramsey and Gertrude Cramsey (née Hulse). She grew up in Hollywood, California.  Career  Prior to World War II Chambers worked for the Walt Disney Company and Universal Pictures, where she did post-production work that involved inking outlines for cartoon celluloid cells in preparation for painting during the picture process stage of film production. Chambers was married to Robert William Chambers, a United States Army pilot who had previously worked at Lockheed in the engineering department. Later, during her service as a WASP, Chambers would be sent on a mission to tour a Lockheed plant. In 1942 during the war, Robert was killed in an aircraft crash. After his death, Chambers and her baby moved in with her parents and she got a job as a telephone operator at Southern California Telephone Company. Chambers applied to be a WASP. She said: \\"Just the day before [my husband's] accident Bob had heard about the WASPs and he wanted me to fly ... in fact, he wanted to teach me, but it didn't work out that way. I love flying as he did, and I hope to be able to replace a man to do the job that Bob wanted to do.\\" She entered training on October 4, 1943, and graduated on April 15, 1944. Chambers trained at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas, and then was sent to Turner Field in Albany, Georgia. She then attended the Army Air Force Tactical School in Orlando, Florida. Chambers was stationed at Greenwood Army Air Field in Greenwood, Mississippi. At Greenwood, Chambers accrued over 420 hours of flight time up until December 20, 1944. As a pilot she flew North American AT-6 advanced trainers, PT-17 biplane primary trainers, Beechcraft AT-10 twin- engineer trainers, and the BT-25. Chambers' service ended when the WASP program was disbanded at the end of 1944. After the war, Chambers worked at American Airlines at LaGuardia Airport in New York City until 1946. She eventually lost touch with the WASP community, a close-knit group who often held reunions and get-togethers.  Honors  On November 2, 1977, President Jimmy Carter passed Public Law 95-202, which gave those that served in the WASP program military veteran status. They were previously considered civilians. In July 2009, President Barack Obama signed a bill that gave the WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal.  Personal life  In 1941, Chambers married Robert William Chambers, a United States Army pilot. Their son, Robert Michael \\"Mike\\" Chambers, who was born in 1942, was in the 1943 movie Heaven Can Wait, playing Don Ameche's character as a baby. In 1947, she married Robert Edward Black, a lumberman. She died in 1961.

For more than two years, Mohammed used the blog to report conditions and events in the Iraqi city of Mosul during the occupation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). During this time, Mosul Eye was an anonymous blog. Mosul was liberated on July 10, 2017, after a battle that lasted for 9 months and 4 days. The blog is frequently cited as one of the few reliable sources documenting life under ISIL rule and has been called a critical source of information for journalists and scholars. Though anonymous, the blogger and his content were judged to be authentic by experts. On 7 December 2017, the blogger revealed his identity as Omar Mohammed. In other venues, Mohammed wrote under the pseudonyms Mouris Milton and Ibn al-Athir al-Mawsilli.  History  Mosul Eye began on Facebook shortly after the ISIL invasion with the goal of keeping the world updated on what was happening in the city. The content is typically written in English and often Arabic, and is mirrored to WordPress.com and Twitter in case the blogger loses access to the Facebook page or it is censored.  Content  Mohammed wrote extensively about ISIL's control of Mosul. One of his first posts contained this report: He described not only the destruction of ancient buildings and burning of library books, but frequent executions and torture by ISIL militants, including beheadings, amputations, public floggings, the stoning of women and murder of homosexuals. In September 2015, Mosul Eye reported details on 455 executions, including the location, ethnicity and religion of the victims. The blogger also publishes information on ISIL members, including photographs of ten ISIL fighters, calling them \\"primary suspects\\" and \\"wanted for committing war crimes against the people of Mosul.\\" The blogger also reports on coalition airstrikes against ISIL targets in the city. In addition to ISIL activities, he reported episodes of resistance against the regime in Mosul. Mosul Eye quotes residents and discusses their attitudes toward the militant group, writing in February 2015, \\"Nowadays, people talk openly in the market about [ISIL] and its cruelty.\\" The blog has also posted details about ISIL's struggles, such as the fighters going three months without a salary, and that there were foreign fighters as young as 13 years old among their ranks. According to a profile done by Al- Fanar Media, Mosul Eye \\"takes a scientific approach to information, trying to gather, categorize and verify data. It also offers sociological and economic analysis, as when it explains how the Islamic State has drawn many of its members and support from a downtrodden rural tribe based outside Mosul; or how corruption, sectarianism and the American policy of de-Baathification, hollowed out the Iraqi army, leaving it incapable of standing up to the Islamic State.\\"  Battle of Mosul  Mosul Eye had posted several updates on the preparations inside the city for the battle to liberate the city that began in October 2016, including ISIL activity and positions, and fears of a looming food crisis. On 2 November, the day after Iraqi Special Operations Forces finally entered the city, he tweeted urgently to coalition forces to warn them that a block of apartments was still occupied by civilians and had not been commandeered by ISIL, as was the rumor, and should not be targeted with airstrikes. The blog also contains the author's personal thoughts on the future of the city as well as fears of being killed. As CNN noted, \\"Sometimes, Mosul Eye has been rather matter-of-fact, but in recent days, as a bloody battle looms between Iraqi forces advancing on the city and the militant ISIS combatants, the writings have turned decidedly melancholy. A few hours ago, Mosul Eye listened to violinist Itzhak Perlman play a concerto on his Stradivarius. Music, banned by ISIS, helps keeps him alive, he said.\\" On 5 November, after Iraqi forces had begun fighting in the city, the blogger wrote of his despair at the scenes of death around him, including seeing children playing with corpses of dead ISIL fighters. He wrote that one of his close friends was decapitated by ISIL, \\"Who will I lose next? What else will I see? I have seen and lived more than enough .. I have seen chopped heads, amputated arms, I have seen people thrown from the top of buildings, thrown over stones .. I have seen their souls trying to hold on to their bodies, but their bodies are so torn apart to hold their spirits. I saw those spirits wondering on the allies of this city!\\" He also wrote that they had begun installing bombs around residential buildings. \\"ISIL is trapping the houses around us with bombs. We live on ticking bombs around us! If airstrikes and gunfire don’t kill us, those car bombs will soon do the job!\\" He also commented on the ISIL militants wandering among the civilians: \\"The faces of ISIL are no longer scare me; nothing scary about their faces. I see fear in their eyes, I hear their voices shouting through their chests, and I feel tgem [sic] say to their selves 'what the hell did we got our selves into?' ... At the same time, I see them like dead bodies walking on the ground.\\"  Blogger's identity  During the occupation, the blogger identified himself only as an \\"independent historian\\"; other journalists identified him as male. He said he considers himself a historian above all and that he is not a journalist. He began blogging after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, but his previous blog has not been identified. He said he has used various aliases and identities to gather information and has received repeated online death threats from ISIL. In an interview with The New Yorker, he said he feigns to be a devout Muslim who is enthusiastic about sharia law to gain the trust of extremists. He described ISIL militants as \\"a group of bonkers [individuals], who could be guided in any direction.\\" According to Al-Fanar, the blogger appeared to be highly educated, making him an additional target of ISIL, which is suspicious of both religious and secular academics. The blogger later named himself as Omar Mohammed.

Rose was born in 1911 in Philadelphia, the son of Issac Louis Rose and Minnie Mutterpearl Rose. Raised in West Philadelphia, he attended Overbrook High School before graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University Law School. In 1940, he married Rosalie Abrams, with whom he would have two children. After law school, he worked as an assistant examiner at the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission before starting a private law practice with an office in the Market Street Bank Building in Center City Philadelphia. He also worked as a part- time boxing promoter. Rose quickly got involved in local politics as a Democrat, becoming leader of the 24th ward. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as one of three members from the 18th district, along with fellow Democrats Marshall L. Shepard and John J. Finnerty. (House members at that time were chosen from multimember districts.) In 1942, despite Republican gains statewide, Rose and Finnerty were reelected along with Democrat Dennis W. Hoggard. Two years later, the voters elected all three representatives to another term. In 1946, the Republicans swept the city and much of the state including Rose's district as he and his co-members went down to defeat. Two years later the Democrats regained some of their losses, including electing Rose, Hoggard, and Edward J. Conway from the 18th district, but Republicans still controlled the House. All three were reelected in 1950, despite Republican gains elsewhere in the state. In 1951, Rose was elected to Philadelphia City Council from West Philadelphia's 4th district, part of a Democratic wave that swept the Republicans from power for the first time in 67 years. He was appointed head of the Law and Government Committee. In 1954, he joined with other reformers to successfully oppose the efforts fellow Democrats James Hugh Joseph Tate and Michael J. Towey to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter. The following year, he was reelected with an increased majority of 68%. After his reelection, he was elected majority leader. Rose changed course and joined with Tate in proposing similar amendments to the charter in 1956. The proposals made it on to the April ballot but were defeated by the voters. Rose suffered a heart attack in April 1959, but recovered enough to win reelection that year. His ailment persisted, however, and he died on January 31, 1960, at the age of 48. Rose was buried at Roosevelt Memorial Park in Trevose, Pennsylvania.

Tannenbaum in 2004 Steven R. Tannenbaum was born and grew up in the Rockaways of Queens, New York City. He attended the Hebrew Institute of Long Island through 9th grade, then moved to Hewlett, Long Island where he graduated from Woodmere H.S. in 1954. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1954-1962, earning a B.S. in Food Technology in 1958 and a PhD. in Food Science in 1962. He was then appointed to Assistant Professor in 1964 in the Department of Food Science and Technology leading up to Full Professor in 1974. Throughout his career he was mentored by Samuel A. Goldblith up until his death in 2001. In 1973 Tannenbaum did a sabbatical at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he decided to switch his career into cancer research at the suggestion of Gerald Wogan. He has held appointments at MIT including Director of the Division of Toxicology (1996-1998) which he cofounded along with Douglas Lauffenburger, of the Division, and then Department of Biological Engineering, the first new academic Department in the MIT School of Engineering in over a generation, and Co-Director from 1998 to July 2003. In 2003-2004 he was the Director of Research of the Cambridge University-MIT Institute. Research Interests Tannenbaum’s areas of research include mechanisms of biochemical activation of chemicals to electrophilic forms that bind to DNA and proteins; application of biomarkers to the prediction of the severity of inflammatory disease; the role of endogenous nitric oxide in inflammation, cytotoxicity, and DNA damage; and development of new tools for drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology. Current research focuses on the causes of IBD, prognostic biomarkers for Dengue fever, human microphysiological systems for drug safety and PK/PD, and the role of nitric oxide in brain pathology, including Alzheimer’s Disease and ASD. Notable Contributions The Tannenbaum laboratory has made important contributions to the etiology of cancer from both environmental and endogenous factors. Most important was the first discovery of the mammalian synthesis of nitrogen oxides, and its linkage to inflammation and injury. This led to a collaboration with Michael Marletta, whose discovery of the enzymatic source of nitric oxide revealed the source of one of the most important signaling molecules in biology. Other notable discoveries include biomarkers of exposure to chemical carcinogens, and predictive biomarkers of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever. His laboratory also collaborated with Linda Griffith in the development of the LiverChip, a microphysiological, immunocompetent, flow-through human liver bioreactor. Honors and awards Dr. Tannenbaum has won a number of awards including being an Elected Member of the National Academy of Medicine in 1996, Chemistry in Cancer Award of the American Association for Cancer Research in 2008, Fellow of the American Chemical Society in 2011, and Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2006.

He was portrayed in the Tony Award winning Broadway musical Grey Gardens in 2006. His life has been documented in the 2011 film The Marble Faun of Grey Gardens. Personal background Torre was born to Italian-American parents in Kensington, Brooklyn, the son of a sanitation worker and a school custodian. He claims that Joe Torre is a distant cousin. In 1974 Torre graduated from Sachem High School. He ran away from home when he was sixteen; mainly to escape a father he described as “very tough, even abusive”. He found his way to East Hampton (village), New York where his uncle was building a house. Torre said his uncle helped him in many ways: “… to construct his house, he used old cobblestones that had been dug up from Brooklyn streets that were being repaved. Cleaning them and learning how to use them to erect walls – all of that was part of my first encounter with stone.” According to an interview, while working as a gardener and maintenance man for the J. Paul Getty’s estate in 1972, (Torre was set up in a room above the garage), he saw a woman in sunglasses and a headscarf walk along the narrow path that led to the entrance of a next door property. The woman was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the former American First Lady and widow of President John F. Kennedy, and who was now married to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. The nearby property and house belonged to Mrs. Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale, aunt and first cousin to Mrs. Onassis. Torre approached the house one day and introduced himself to Edith “Little Edie” Beale and asked if she needed any work done. “Little Edie” introduced him to her mother “Big Edie” who lectured him about the benefits of a balanced diet and then proceeded to offer him a boiled potato salad and a chicken. Shortly thereafter he became their personal handyman, doing odd jobs around the house. It was during this time that filmmakers Albert and David Maysles filmed the documentary Grey Gardens. After leaving East Hampton, Torre went to Maine to build a cabin. He then went to work as an assistant to the ventriloquist Wayland Flowers. Later, through Aristotle Onassis, he acquired a job tending a two-and-a-half-acre palace garden in Saudi Arabia, Riyadh. After returning to the States, Torre ran an art-moving company called AAA All-Boro Trucking in New York City and then drove a cab for 20 years. On the side, he carved in stone. In 2005, a woman got into Torre’s taxi cab in New York City carrying a video camera and tripod. He asked her if she had ever seen the film Grey Gardens. When she replied that she had, Torre said: “Well, I’m the Marble Faun.” The woman told him, “Albert Maysles has been looking for you for years. You've got to call his studio.” Not long after the encounter in the taxi, Torre learned not only that he had become a cult icon figure but that he was about to be portrayed onstage in a musical based on the film at Playwrights Horizons in New York City. Shortly after making contact, Torre and Maysles (David had died in 1987) reconnected and conversed for hours, with the documentarian filming the entire time. Maysles recalled, \\"Seeing Jerry again brought me right back to the time when we were all in the same little bedroom together and he was eating corn cooked by Mrs. Beale.\\" In 2008, playwright David Lally premiered his play ‘’Little Edie & The Marble Faun’’ at The Metropolitan Playhouse's Annual Author Fest; and in 2011, filmmakers Steve Pellizza and Jason Hay released the documentary The Marble Faun of Grey Gardens, which follows Torre’s life after Grey Gardens to his job in Saudi Arabia, his days when he worked as a cab driver, to the present day as a professional sculptor. Today he lives with his partner of many years Ted O'ryan Sheppard (He is the Visual Director of Christofle Silver). They both work on many art projects together. Torre released his memoir entitled The Marble Faun of Grey Gardens: A Memoir of the Beales, the Maysles Brothers, and Jacqueline Kennedy with film historian and author Tony Maietta in February 2018. Grey Gardens In the summer of 1974, while working for the J. Paul Getty estate in East Hampton, New York, Torre rode his bike a different way than usual one day and approached a house where the hedges in front were so overgrown that the only parts visible were the two peaks of the gabled roof. He decided to explore what he thought was abandoned property. Looking into the foyer, he could see cobwebs strewn from the walls to the chandelier. It was like a “scene out of a book.\\" A lady came right to the door, opened it and said: “Oh, the Marble Faun is here,” a reference to a Nathaniel Hawthorne story about a Greek sculpture. Torre had no idea what she meant, but was enthralled. The lady was Edith Bouvier Beale, cousin to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and daughter of Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale, the aunt of Onassis. The house was the Bouvier mansion Grey Gardens and Torre became the Beales’ handyman; doing odd jobs around the house. That same summer, the Beales were filmed by brothers David and Albert Maysles as the subject of the 1975 documentary Grey Gardens. The film became a cult sensation, and 31 years later, a Tony Award winning Broadway musical. Torre was played by actor Matthew Cavenaugh. The other subjects included in the film were Jack Helmuth and Lois Wright. Due to Torre’s particular known affection for Mrs. Beale, the songwriting team for the musical Grey Gardens (Scott Frankel and Doug Wright) wrote a special song called “Jerry Likes My Corn” which tenderly describes the relationship they shared. Torre claimed that the Beales “showed [him] a life where [he] could be [himself], explore, take chances.” In 2009, HBO released the film Grey Gardens starring Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange about the lives of “Big” and “Little” Edie. According to director Michael Sucsy, Torre is not depicted in the film (although at one point on the film's commentary track, Sucsy can be heard exclaiming of a non-speaking character, “That’s Jerry! That’s our Marble Faun”). Today, Torre travels the country, attending film festivals and productions of Grey Gardens and making special guest appearances as “The Marble Faun”. Torre was interviewed for NBC Nightly News which aired a special report covering the sale of Grey Gardens with Anne Thompson on February 23, 2017. Sculptor In 1964, Torre went to the New York World’s Fair. While holding his mother’s hand in the Vatican Pavilion, he saw the \\"Virgin Mary with Christ\\" (Michelangelo’s “Pietà”) and said he “had [his] calling that day. He recalled: “I was amazed something so tender could be carved from something so difficult.” According to gallery owner Jackie Klempay, while spending time in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Torre had a horse named “Confetti” who became the subject of the art for his exhibited pieces. He began carving stone in his partner's apartment stairwell on 23rd Street in New York City in 1987. In 2006, Torre was asked about his future plans. He responded: “I want to attend The Arts Students League, here in NY, to be taught the ins and outs of stone-carving.” Torre is presently a Queens-based artist, primarily working in stone and earthenware. His debut exhibition was in 2014 at the Jackie Klempay Gallery in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York. He has since exhibited artwork at Center 548 in Chelsea, Manhattan, Canada Gallery, and the Andrew Edlin Gallery, among others.

Language The Yinikurtira spoke a dialect of Thalanyji. Country The Yinikurtira's traditional lands enclosed about around the North West Cape peninsula area down to Exmouth Gulf and the Whaleback Hills, and from the cape southwest to Point Cloates. People Norman Tindale classified the Yinikutira as a distinct tribe, on the basis of his informants who insisted that traditionally they had been distinct and separate from the eastern Thalanyji. Peter Austin sees them as a dialect subdivision of the Thalanyji- speaking people. While they were observed by early explorers deploying rafts to venture out into the sea for hunting, their primary source of food came from a network of fish traps which they maintained in tidal estuaries. History The area was described by William Dampier, in 1699, and American whalers are known to have hunted sperm and then humpback whales off the Ningaloo coast as early as the 1790s, and it is thought probably they landed to seek meat and refresh their water supplies. Yinikutira people gave assistance and then hospitality to two Dalmatian Italians from the Austro- Hungarian Stefano who after the Stefano was shipwrecked on the Ningaloo Reef in 1875. The two, Michele Bacich (17) and Giovanni Iurich (20), later, on repatriation to Ragusa, provided an account of their experiences in a manuscript (Naufraghi dello Stefano) written up by a Jesuit priest, Father Stefano Scurla, which also contains a word-list of the language they learnt, a Ngarluma creole, during their three month sojourn with the Yinikutira. The Yinikutira's staple diet was based on fish, turtle and dugong. They lived in the mangroves and would venture out to sea on logs. In that same year, 1876, the first pastoral lease was taken up in the area when Minilya Station was established over the Exmouth Peninsula in its entirely. After subdivisions, Thomas Carter established the Yardie Creek Station over 54,600 hectares. At some point in this time, the Yinikutira disappeared from history. It has been speculated that, after the Colonial Secretary's Office forbade the use of convict labour above the 26th parallel, the local workforce among pearlers and pastoralists began to recruit indigenous tribes. The provisions of the subsequent Master and Servant Act (1867) meant that in this area, as applied, natives who absconded from contracted service ended up doing hard labour in Roebourne prison. The available evidence suggests that the local tribes such as the Yinikutira were decimated by the practice of blackbirding and introduced diseases. No indigenous people of the present day claim descent from the Yunikutira. The Yardie Creek Station was eventually re-acquired in 1959 by the Western Australian Government to become part of the Cape Range National Park. Burial customs The Yinikutira practiced a distinctive form of burial not shared by other Thalanyji-speaking peoples. Alternative names * Inikurdira, Jinigudera, Jinigura, Jiniguri. * Jarungura.

It is filed by nonprofits to get exemption status.  Eligibility  The following organizations are eligible to file Form 1023 under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code: * Religious or charitable organizations * Scientific organizations and organizations that test for public safety * Literary or educational organizations * National or international amateur sports competitors * Organizations created to prevent cruelty to children or animals However, the IRS allows certain groups to be automatically exempt from filing Form 1023, yet still eligible to be classified as a 501(c)(3) organization: * Churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches * Organizations that are not private foundations and that have gross receipts that normally are not more than $5,000 Furthermore, to qualify for tax-exempt status, the organization must be: * Organized as a corporation, LLC, trust, or unincorporated association with organization documents limiting the organization's reach permanently to the purpose it's filing the form for. * Operated to further the purposes laid out in its organization documents, and: ** Refrain from participating in political campaigns or promoting legislative activity ** Ensure that its assets and earnings don't unjustly benefit board members, officers, or other key members of the organization ** Refrain from promoting private or non-tax-exempt purposes more than insubstantially ** Not engage in illegal activities or violate fundamental public policy Tax-exempt organizations may file Form 5768 to influence legislative activity.  Filing requirements  Form 1023 requires the following information about an applying charity: * Date of organization's creation and what country it was created under * Organizational structure * Organizing documents (e.g. articles of incorporation, trust agreement, articles of association) * Description of organization's past, present, and future activities * Compensation of the organization's officers, directors, trustees, employees, and independent contractors * Other members and individuals receiving benefits * Organization's history, including whether the organization is the successor of another * Specific activities as outlined in the form, including any fundraisers * Financial data for the past four years Applications cost $400 if the charity has earned less than $10,000 annually for the past four years, and $600 if over that amount.  Form 1023-EZ  Form 1023-EZ is a streamlined version of Form 1023; it was introduced in 2014 because the original Form 1023 can take over nine hours to complete, and many organizations were waiting over a year for review. About 52% of all organizations filed Form 1023-EZ, with an average turnaround time of 9 days. Of the organizations submitted, 95% of them were approved for charity status.  Requirements  Organizations applying for tax-exempt status through Form 1023-EZ can apply online at Pay.gov if they meet the following requirements: * Gross receipts in each of the past three years and projected next three years are below $50,000 * Total assets are less than $250,000 * The organization was created under United States law and its mailing address is within the United States * The organization is not a successor to, or controlled by, an entity suspended as a terrorist organization as defined by section 501(p) * Are organized as a corporation, unincorporated association, or trust * Not a successor of a for-profit entity * Not a revoked or previously revoked organization * Not a church (or other place of worship), church association, school, college, university, hospital, medical research organization, HMO, ACO or organization participating in ACO activities, organized and operated exclusively for public safety testing, * Are not applying for an exemption as a cooperative hospital service organization, cooperative service organization of operating educational organizations or qualified charitable risk pool * Are not requesting application as a supporting organization or private operating foundation * Do not offer credit counseling as the main service, invest more than 5% of assets in non-public trading, or offer carbon credits or carbon offsets * Do not maintain or intend to maintain one or more donor-advised funds Organizations that do not fall under these requirements may still file the original Form 1023.  History  Form 1023-EZ was created when the National Taxpayer Advocate suggested simplifying the form in 2011, and the IRS eventually followed that advice in 2013. The form was finally introduced in July 2014. While the majority of charities will file through Form 1023-EZ, the move to simplify it wasn't without its criticisms. As Form 1023-EZ doesn't require a list of charity activities or supporting documentation, those activities will go unknown to the IRS, and there is no protection against uncharitable organizations filing the form for tax exemption status. In the 2015 Annual Report, the IRS reported an audit on Form 1023-EZ revealing that 2 in 5 charities that filed Form 1023-EZ would not qualify for charity status if they had gone through the full Form 1023. Furthermore, in 2016, the application fee for Form 1023-EZ had been reduced from $400 to $275.

Early work After a first apprenticeship by his father John, he further developed his skills with Thomas Powell, to whom he was apprenticed June 17, 1795.Dictionary of Violin Makers by Cecie Stainer (2001, Hardcover, reprint) He started to work for the renowned William Forster (III) in 1802, and as soon as 1804 he became independent and established his workshop 16 Princes Street. Many of the most famous makers of his time worked for him, as for an example James Brown and later some of the best bow makers, including Thomas Tubbs, James Dodd and Edward Dodd. William Forster (IV) also made instruments for him starting in 1810, as did John Crowther later. Independent workshop In 1813 Kennedy opened his own workshop in 16, Nassau Street and three years later, in 1816, he opened a larger shop at 364 Oxford Street. He remained in the same shop till June 1849. After the second half of the century, Thomas Kennedy continued to work from various addresses: 4 Cummings Place, 4 King’s Road, and 164 Pentonville Road. He and his workers were supplying instruments to the firm of Goulding, D’Almaine & Co. Sometimes their brand is to be found beneath the back button. Work quality Kennedy was a prolific maker, working in various grades, from unpurfled instruments with thin dark and cracked varnish to distinguished and superbly finished instruments with a fine transparent spirit varnish.The Brompton's Book of Violin and Bow Makers, John Dilworth, London 2012 He was well known to experiment and built some of his instruments with the bass-bar and the table carved out of a single slab of wood, in opposition to his prime work where the bar was glued on the inside of the table, like the Italian masters did.Willibald Leo Lütgendorff (de), Die Geigen und Lautenmacher vom Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart, Frankfurt am Main, 1922 (In German) Today, very few instruments still bear the original design however, as most were restored or upgraded. His cellos are best known, and are often prized as soloists instruments. The model is usually made on a distinctive shortened Nicola Amati model with long middle bouts. The heads are usually carved in the style of Nicola Amati, however with more deeply curved chins, but earlier models also have a typical Jacob Stainer head, in the style of his teacher William Forster. He produced an estimated 50 high quality double-basses and a few chamber-basses too, based on a smaller model. Most of his work is signed in pencil on the inner surface of the table, and occasionally in ink above the endpin on the lower ribs. The bows produced in his workshop had originally open ivory frogs.

Arising from the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and nationalist campaigns of the mid- to late twentieth century elsewhere, the increasing numbers of Christians in sub-Saharan Africa has led to an increased interest in Christian responses to the region's continuing issues of poverty, violence, and war. According to the Cameroonian theologian and sociologist Jean-Marc Éla, African Christianity \\"has to be formulated from the struggles of our people, from their joys, from their pains, from their hopes and from their frustrations today.\\" African theology is heavily influenced by liberation theology, global black theology, and postcolonial theology.  Hermeneutics  Much of African political theology owes to distinctively African readings of the Bible. African theologians interpret the Bible through the lens the African experience, oppression and poverty being frequent themes. Itumeleng Mosala argues that the Bible itself must be understood as having arisen from the ideology of its compilers and that an uncritical acceptance of the Bible as the word of God leads to a notion that it has no ideology itself. Mosala says that this idea is wrong and that the Bible's compilation makes it inherently ideological, reflecting that of its compilers, and that the ideology it presents is harmful to colonized peoples. Mosala, like several others, also includes Marxist elements in his reading of the Bible. The Tswana theologian Musa Dube employs a \\"decolonizing feminist biblical practice\\" she calls \\"Rahab's reading prism.\\" Named for the prostitute who protected Israelite spies who came to investigate Jericho before it was besieged by the Israelite army. Dube says her prism highlights \\"the historical fact of colonizing and decolonizing communities inhabiting the feminist space of liberation practice.\\" She argues for a new reading of the Bible by colonized peoples in order to create new narratives that speak of equity and freedom. For her, the interests of the decolonizing project are a part of the feminist agenda. For some, the biblical text may be disregarded in favour of perceived direction from the Holy Spirit.  Themes  Arising out of the distinctive African hermeneutic, several themes are common among African theologians as concerns for a Christian response in the public sphere.  Christology  Jesse N. K. Mugambi and Laurenti Magesa have written that \\"theology is not Christian at all when it does not offer Jesus Christ of Nazareth as the answer to the human quest\\", including politics. For many African theologians, Jesus is seen as a liberating figure, including liberation from inequality, oppression, and poverty in opposition to what Jean-Marc Éla identifies as a \\"Babylonian captivity\\" of Christianity to Greco-Latin philosophies and Christologies that do not relate to the African experience. Among these are the image of an \\"imperial\\" Christ used to justify oppression and a \\"slave- trader\\" Christ used to promote faith in a distant salvation rather than earthly liberation. Éla's use of the terms \\"imperial\\" and \\"slave-holder\\" in reference to Jesus are not literal but serve to show the effects of traditional readings which serve to keep subjugated peoples from attempting to free themselves out of a belief that a distant salvation will come.  Equality  Having been subjected and treated as less than human, African theologians seek to validate their humanity on par with that of others. For example, Ananias Mpunzi writes that \\"we have the task both of affirming the humanity of others and helping them to affirm it for themselves.\\"  Church and state  Though religious leaders like South Africa's Desmond Tutu play important roles in several African states as public commentators on moral issues, only Zambia has declared itself to be officially a Christian nation. The Ugandan Catholic priest Emmanuel Katongole has written that the Christian gospel is deeply political and that the most urgent task for Christianity is to make politics work better, become more democratic and transparent, thus promoting stability and encouraging development. Éla calls on the church to be the link between revelation and history, or to push for political change, shaping the world of today rather than waiting for an otherworldly salvation.  Reconciliation  After decades of colonial rule and mismanagement by postcolonial governments, many Africans became embittered. According to Emmanuel Katongole, Christianity must engage with that past in order to move forward. Opinions on how that is to be done vary. Katongole sees the way forward in overcoming tribal divisions, forgiveness, and working together, something he sees Christianity uniquely capable of doing. Willa Boesek, on the other hand, writing shortly after the end of South African apartheid encouraged a righteous anger that could lead to change but differentiated it from hate-filled rage. He admonished victims to control their anger, urging them to not indict all white people for the oppression. At the same time, he urged white South African churches to help their members overcome their fear of blacks and to not expect immediate reconciliation. Bitterness, anger, and aggression were natural consequences of the situation in South Africa, he believed, \\"a kind of unnatural 'Christian' patience and reasonableness vis-à- vis this history is not Christian at all, but a distorted ethos of submissiveness forced upon oppressed people\\". Others, like Desmond Tutu in his Ubuntu theology, press for a peaceful reconciliation.  Land, resources, and poverty  Under colonialism, Africa's land and resources were expropriated by white settlers and colonial agents, leaving the indigenous inhabitants with little of the continent's wealth. The issue of land restoration and redistribution are common topics for African theologians in the postcolonial era. An oft-repeated refrain from the missionary enterprise is that white people came to Africa with the Bible and the people had the land. The white missionaries taught the people to pray and when they opened their eyes, the Africans had the Bible and the whites had the land. Boesak encouraged white churches in South Africa to examine their role in the historical appropriation of black land. Itumeleng Mosala addresses land and poverty in his reading of the Book of Micah, emphasizing the sin of Israel in neglecting the poor.  Criticisms  As a contextual theology, African political theology lacks universality. It has been criticized it for being provisional, tentative, halting, and imprecise. M. Shawn Copeland points out an insufficiently rigorous analysis of imperialism, capitalism, and democracy. She identifies gaps in the discussions within African theology, specifically noting that a lack of theological critique in Zimbabwe and Nigeria \\"mock the rhetoric of black theology as public theology and further distort the church's ministerial praxis.\\"  References = Notes  Bibliography  : : : : : : : : : Category:Christian theology and politics Category:Christianity in Africa Category:World Christianity Sub-Saharan Africa ","title":"Political theology in sub-Saharan Africa"},{"id":"52069129","text":"Self-portrait (date unknown) Petre Iorgulescu-Yor (24 December 1890, Râmnicu Sărat – 29 April 1939, Bucharest) was a Romanian Expressionist painter of Jewish and Greek ancestry. Biography His father was a landowner who held several local political offices. After attending the Matei Basarab High School in Bucharest, he graduated from the Law Faculty in Iași in 1914. During World War I, he went against his family's wishes and gave up a promising legal career to become an artist. He and his father were never reconciled. After the war, in 1919, he sold most of his belongings and went to Paris, where he enrolled at the Académie Julian; studying with Othon Friesz and Maurice Denis. He also came under the influence of Les Nabis. His début was at the Salon in 1920 and it received good reviews from the press. In 1927, he and his friend, Vasile Popescu, spent their time painting in villages on the banks of the Siret. From 1928 to 1939, he was a regular exhibitor at the Official Bucharest Salon. Although he painted numerous still-lifes, landscapes with villages remained his speciality. He was particularly fond of Sighișoara and other small towns in Transylvania. He also spent time in the Bulgarian seaside resort of Balchik and occasionally went to Brittany. In 1929, he won a gold medal at the Barcelona International Exposition. From 1933 to 1934, he was custodian at the new Municipal Art Gallery in Bucharest. For several years, he taught at a private art school. He always led a disorganized, Bohemian lifestyle. His last years were marked by intense physical and mental suffering from unspecified conditions. In 1939, he stayed briefly at a sanatorium in Cluj and committed suicide by shooting himself later that year at his family's residence in Bucharest.

It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 7, 2017, by Gravitas Ventures. Controversy over the documentary has led to some protests and cancellations of its screenings.

Content The Red Pill shifts from Jaye's investigation of what she initially believed to be a hate movement to more sympathetic coverage of the movement. The shift is shown in the film through Jaye's questions about her own views on gender, power, and privilege. The Red Pill also discusses issues facing men and boys. It includes interviews with men's rights activists and those supportive of the movement, such as Paul Elam, founder of A Voice for Men; Harry Crouch, president of the National Coalition for Men; Warren Farrell, author of The Myth of Male Power; and Erin Pizzey, who started the first domestic violence shelter in the modern world. It also includes interviews with feminists critical of the movement, such as Ms. magazine executive editor Katherine Spillar, and sociologist Michael Kimmel. It also contains excerpts from Jaye's video diary. Some of the issues discussed as facing men and boys are male suicide rates, workplace fatalities and high-risk jobs, military conscription, lack of services for male victims of domestic violence and rape, higher rates of violent victimization, issues concerning divorce and child custody, disparity in criminal sentencing, disproportionately less funding and research on men's health issues, educational inequality, societal tolerance of misandry, male genital mutilation, men's lack of reproductive rights, life expectancy, false rape allegations, paternity fraud and homelessness. Funding According to director Cassie Jaye she initially struggled to find financiers for a film about the men's rights movement. In an October 2015 interview with Breitbart News she said \\"we weren't finding executive producers who wanted to take a balanced approach, we found people who wanted to make a feminist film.\\" Jaye instead started making the film using her own money as well as money from friends and family. She also started a campaign on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, which she called a last resort. The Kickstarter page, which described the project as a fair and balanced look at the men's rights movement, was strongly criticized by some feminists. The campaign raised $211,260, exceeding its goal of $97,000. Alan Scherstuhl's review for The Village Voice suggested that many of those providing funding for the film may have themselves been men's rights activists (MRAs), thereby creating a conflict of interest. Jaye has said that the suggestion the film was funded by MRAs is \\"a common lie that keeps spreading\\". Jaye stated that \\"our five highest backers ... are neither MRA nor feminist. I would say three out of five of them didn't even know about the men's rights movement, but wanted to defend free speech,\\" and that the film's backers and producers would have no influence or control of the film. Release The Red Pill had its world premiere on October 7, 2016 at Cinema Village in New York City. It played there for a week before opening in Los Angeles on October 14, 2016. One-time screenings were also scheduled at various locations in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. In March 2017 the film was made available online. Screening cancellations The Australian premiere at the Palace Kino cinema in Melbourne cancelled their planned November 6 screening after a petition circulated that called the film \\"misogynistic propaganda\\". The Change.org petition was declared victorious with 2,370 signatures. A counter- petition to reverse the decision gained close to 5,000 supporters in the following days, characterizing the original petition as an \\"effort to close down free speech in Australia\\" by those who wish to prevent \\"a screening of a movie that discusses issues that they fear might interfere with their agenda.\\" Organizer David Williams was critical of the original petition, stating that nobody who signed the petition would have seen the film. The Mayfair Theatre, in Ottawa, cancelled a private screening of the film. Lee Demarbre, co-owner and programmer of the theater, said long-time patrons and a sponsor threatened to stop doing business with the venue if the film screening went ahead. The screening was organized by the Canadian Association for Equality (CAFE). Justin Trottier, co-founder of CAFE, said that the screening was an attempt to find common ground instead of polarizing the debate. Julie Lalonde, who runs Hollaback! Ottawa, was one of several people who made complaints to the theater. She said the idea of freedom of expression was being abused, and that \\"no one has the right to have their film shown.\\" A screening had been planned by the Wildrose on Campus club at the University of Calgary, an organization for student supporters of the Wildrose Party of Alberta, but was cancelled after an email about the screening was sent out by the club with the subject line \\"Feminism is Cancer\\" and beginning \\"You and I both know that feminism is cancer. To create a dialogue on campus, we have decided to take action.\\" The club later posted an apology to Twitter and cancelled the screening. In response to the controversy, Jaye said she would never equate feminism with cancer but \\"would be curious why do they think that.\\" After initially agreeing to finance a student screening, Sydney University's student union defunded the event, claiming the film promotes violence against women. In a public post on its website, the union said \\"We believe there is the distinct possibility that the planned screening of this documentary would be discriminatory against women, and has the capacity to intimidate and physically threaten women on campus\\". The screening was moved back a week and had to be financed privately by the clubs that had initially organized it. Reception=Critical response Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes has given the documentary a 29% rating based on 7 critic reviews, with an average rating of 4/10.\\"The Red Pill (2016)\\", Rottentomatoes.com. Katie Walsh of Los Angeles Times said the documentary \\"lacks a coherent argument\\" because it \\"is built on a fundamental misunderstanding\\" of key terms. Walsh said the terms could have been better defined \\"to comprehend the ways in which patriarchal systems control resources to exploit both women and men\\". She recognized that \\"there are many dire and urgent troubles men face that should be addressed\\" but concluded of the documentary, \\"[It] only exacerbates that divide with its uncritical, lopsided presentation and inability to craft a compelling argument regarding a topic this controversial.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"Cassie Jaye's The Red Pill is clumsy and frustrating in many ways. But it demonstrates enough sincerity and openness to challenging ideas — letting representatives of this problematic movement make their case clearly and convincingly — that one wishes it were able to look at multiple sides of this debate at the same time.\\" DeFore summarized the film as \\"an admirable attempt at evenhandedness whose journalistic and aesthetic failings dilute its arguments\\". Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice, critical of the men's rights movement, considered the film's production quality weak due to being Kickstarter-funded and highlighted that it was campaigned for by A Voice for Men and Reddit's men's rights forums. Scherstuhl considered the documentary to be \\"amateurish\\" with weak visuals. He said, \\"What the film and the movement fail to demonstrate is any kind of systemic cause. Instead, the author of men’s troubles here is always that vague bugaboo feminism, which we’re told is designed to silence its opponents.\\" Cathy Young of Heat Street gave the film a positive review, saying it raised important issues that often go undiscussed and made \\"well-deserved\\" criticisms of feminism. She criticized the film for failing to devote attention to \\"the dark side of the men's movement\\", and stated that the film would have benefited from onscreen discussion of the subjects in which MRAs are on \\"far shakier ground\\". Corrine Barraclough, of the Australian tabloid newspaper The Daily Telegraph, said \\"the message of The Red Pill is compassion\\" and the film made her \\"wonder why feminists tried so hard to silence this crucial conversation.\\" Awards The Red Pill won three awards at the 2017 Idyllwild International Festival of Cinema: \\"Best of Festival\\", \\"Excellence in Directing Documentary\\", and \\"Excellence in Producing a Documentary\\". Cassie Jaye also won the \\"Women in Film Award\\" at the Hollywood Digifest Festival for her work on the film.

Truman, did not appear on the ballot. The state Supreme Court ruled that any statute requiring party presidential electors to vote for that party's national nominee was void.Key, V.O. junior; Southern Politics in State and Nation; p. 340 A \\"Loyalist\\" group did petition governor \\"Big Jim\\" Folsom to allow Truman electors, but Senator John Sparkman, fearing popular defeat at the hands of the Dixiecrats and a hostile state legislature, decided against placing Truman electors on the ballot.Barnard, William D.; Dixiecrats and Democrats: Alabama Politics, p. 123 In other Southern states where he was on the ballot, Thurmond was forced to run under the label of the States' Rights Democratic Party. Thurmond overwhelmingly won Alabama by a margin of 60.71 percent, or 130,513 votes, against his closest opponent, Republican New York governor Thomas E. Dewey. Two third-party candidates, Henry A. Wallace of the Progressive Party and Claude A. Watson of the Prohibition Party, appeared on the ballot in Alabama, though neither had any impact on the election.  Analysis  Southern Democrats walked out at the party's national convention in Philadelphia because of Truman's endorsement of civil rights for African Americans. This segregationist faction met on July 17, 1948, in Birmingham, nominating South Carolina governor Strom Thurmond as its nominee for president. Mississippi governor Fielding L. Wright was nominated for vice president. Thurmond won 66 of Alabama's 67 counties, with the sole holdout being in the northern part of the state where Winston County gave Dewey over sixty percent of the vote.

After gaining its independence from Indonesia in 2002, there was little discord between the East Timor press and the government. However, after 2005, the East Timor government was more active in attempting to suppress anti-government sentiment in several of the country's newspapers, leading the rights group Freedom House to downgrade its press status from \\"Free\\" to \\"Partly Free\\" in its 2006 report.  Background  In 2005, Reporters Without Borders said East Timor had one of the most liberal press environments in Asia. However that same year, parliament gave the executive authority to enact a new penal law that criminalized defamation and dramatically increased penalties for defaming government officials. The move was the first in a series of steps by the government against news outlets and journalists that wrote about issues such as corruption and widespread hunger. The effort would later include criminal indictments against some of the country's most prominent journalists. These indictments, and East Timor's legal restrictions on the press, have widely criticized by press freedom groups around the world.Timor Post headquarters in Dili One early sign of the changing environment was the government's 2005 treatment of the daily newspaper Suara Timor Lorosae for its coverage of a famine in the country. In response, the government evicted the newspaper from its offices, halted government advertising in the newspaper, banned officials from speaking with Suara Timor Lorosae reporters, and ordered government agencies to boycott the publication. In 2007, the newspaper's offices were attacked during a period of political tension, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In 2009 and 2015, high-ranking officials in the government brought criminal defamation charges against investigative journalists who reported on corruption. A 2014 media law passed by parliament was widely criticized by journalists in East Timor and press freedom groups when members of the government began using criminal defamation laws to prosecute journalists who reported on corruption.  2013 Media Code Proposal  In October 2013, a group of approximately 150 East Timorese journalists gathered in Dili, the country's capital. The assembled journalists voted on a proposal about journalistic self-regulation within the country. Included in this proposal was a 10-point code of ethics that addressed issues of freedom of expression, confidentiality of sources, and accuracy in reporting. The code was also put in place to curb the common practice of government officials paying journalists to report on them and their policies in a favorable manner.  2014 Media Code Amendment  On May 6, 2014, the East Timor Parliament amended the 2013 Media Code and drafted new certification requirements for journalists in the country. The new law would make journalists go through a training process with a press organization that has been certified by the official government Press Council. This training process would take from six to 18 months.  New provisions  Article 9 in the document states: “1) Everyone has the freedom to express and disseminate their ideas through the media. 2) No one shall be disquieted for their political, philosophical, religious or other opinions.” Some have cited provisions in Article 17 that seem to contradict the statements in Article 9. This article excludes civil servants, advertisers, political leaders or office-holders from practicing journalism “concurrently” with their occupation. In Chapter 8 of the document, details of the new Press Council are outlined. The article states the council will be made up of five people who have the power to “Exercise disciplinary authority over journalists,” and “Grant, renew, suspend and revoke the professional credentials of journalists.” = Criticism = After the new law was passed by parliament, it was sharply criticized by various press freedom groups. Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on the government to “eliminate the Media Act’s Requirement of an official Press Council and its requisite listing of journalists in favor of media self-regulation.” Some members of the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) called the law \\"draconian\\", and sent a petition to the East Timor Government, urging them to strike down the law. Because of the 2014 law, East Timor dropped 26 places to 103rd place out of 180 countries on the Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index. It was the second- sharpest drop on the list behind Andorra, which fell 27 places. = Appeal = In response to widespread criticism of the law, in July 2014, East Timor President Taur Matan Ruak, who had not yet signed the bill, sent the proposal to East Timor's Court of Appeal to determine its constitutionality. In August 2014,The Court of Appeal found several aspects of the media law to be unconstitutional and was sent back to East Timor's parliament. As of October 2016, no more significant action has been taken by East Timor's Government to amend the bill.  Indicted journalists = Jose Belo  In 2008, East Timor Minister of Justice Lucia Lobato accused Jose Belo, publisher of investigative newspaper Tempo Semanal of defamation. At the time, many of the press laws in East Timor were inherited from Indonesian military rule. In a number of articles in Tempo Semanal, Belo accused Lobato of corruption and using her power to get friends and family members into high-paying government positions. In response, Lobato brought a defamation charge against Belo using an Indonesian-era law that made defamation a criminal offense. Lobato was criticized by many members of the East Timor press, as she and other members of the East Timor government were in the process of drafting a new law that downgraded defamation to a civil, rather than criminal offense. Under the old law, Belo faced a possible prison sentence of seven years. Belo said “It’s very sad for my country that they keep using foreign invader’s laws to prosecute me. We should have our own laws.” After the East Timor Government pressed charges against Belo, several press freedom groups criticized the East Timor Government for limiting press freedoms. Some of these groups include East Timor and Indonesia Action Network (ETAN), Pacific Media Watch (PMW), and the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism (ACIJ) who sent a letter to East Timor's President José Ramos-Horta urging him to drop the charges against Belo. = Court decision = Ultimately, outside support for Belo helped his case. In June 2009, Ramos-Horta passed a law that removed defamation as a criminal offense. Soon after, charges against Belo and the Tempo Semanal were dismissed.  Raimundos Oki  On November 10, 2015, freelance reporter Raimundos Oki wrote an article for the Timor Post in which he accused East Timor Prime Minister Rui Maria de Araújo of possible “bid rigging” in a government computer contract. In this case, Oki contends that Araujo had a history of this practice, and according to internal government documents, he gave preferential treatment to a particular technological firm—Packet Sistemindonesia Teknotama (PT). = Defamation charges = After the story's release, the government claimed Oki had released the story with a “factual error” by misspelling the name of technology firm, PT. On November 17, 2015, The Timor Post issued a correction with the accurate spelling of PT and printed a written response from the prime minister's office, defending itself against the accusations. In January 2016, the East Timor Government charged Oki with criminal defamation charges. Oki faces a maximum sentence of three years in jail if convicted. = Outside support = As in the case of Jose Belo, many press freedom groups have voiced their support for Oki. The IFJ, CPJ, and Freedom House are just a few who have reached out to the East Timor Government. In a letter sent to Prime Minister de Araujo in April 2016, they urged him to drop charges against Oki and his former editor, Lourenco Martins. In a response letter to the group, Araujo said: “I will not trade press freedom and freedom of expression with ‘press irresponsibility’ and ‘irresponsible expression of freedom.”  References  East Timor Category:Human rights in East Timor ","title":"Freedom of the press in East Timor"},{"id":"52069235","text":"Tara Maree Cheyne (pronounced Chain) (born 30 December 1986) is an elected Member for the Ginninderra electorate in the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly as of 26 October 2016.

He subsequently moved into journalism, writing for The Weekly News and the Dundee Courier for almost 25 years. He is best known for his Fractured Europe series, which has received multiple award nominations, with the third novel, Europe in Winter, winning the BSFA Award for Best Novel. Early writing career By the age of 21, Hutchinson had published four volumes of stories: Thumbprints (1978), Fools' Gold (1979), Torn Air (1980) and The Paradise Equation (1981), all under the name David Hutchinson. Writing as Dave Hutchinson, in 2004 he published As the Crow Flies, his fifth collection of short fiction, and combined elements of horror, science fiction and fantasy. His first novel, The Villages (2001), blends elements of fantasy, science fiction and the supernatural. It was followed by a novella, The Push (2009, NewCon Press), a science fiction story set in space, describing the inception of faster-than-light travel and speculating on the possible consequences of humans settling on planets populated by alien beings. It was shortlisted for the 2010 BSFA award for short fiction. Hutchinson has also edited two anthologies and co-edited a third. His short story \\"The Incredible Exploding Man\\" was included in the first Solaris Rising anthology and appeared in the 29th Year’s Best Science Fiction collection.

The novel featured in a number of annual best-of-the-year round-ups, including those of The Guardian, The Huffington Post and Locus magazine. The LA Review of Books described Europe In Autumn as \\"one of the most sophisticated science fiction novels of the decade\\".

The second book was included in the 2015 Locus Recommended Reading List. A third novel in the series, Europe in Winter, was published in November 2016, with the first book's protagonist returning. Hutchinson completed the series with Europe At Dawn in 2018, but has indicated there may be a further novella at some point in the future. Achievements In 2010 Hutchinson’s novella The Push was nominated for the BSFA Short Fiction Award.

They were known to the Italians as shifta.  Organisation  The Patriot movement was mostly based in the rural Shewa, Gondar and Gojam regions, though it drew support from all over occupied Ethiopia. Several hundred Eritreans also participated. Small cells operated in Addis Ababa and other towns, known as Wust Arbagna (Insider Patriots). The Black Lions took part in the movement. In 1937/1938, there were an estimated 25,000 active Patriots in Ethiopia. The average band of resistance fighters was estimated in 1938 to have included 400 to 500 members, depending on the agricultural season.  Christians  The Patriots had the near-total support of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. The majority of participants were Christian highlanders. Ethiopian Muslims were less involved in the Italo- Ethiopian conflict and sometimes considered the Christians as much their enemies as the Italians. Relations between the two religious groups were tenuous throughout Italian occupation and in one instance Muslim Oromo attacked and killed retreating Patriots in Wollo Province.  Women  A number of women participated in the Patriot movement, many of whom had been raped by Italian soldiers. Ethiopian women fought in combat against the Italians and took on support roles, made possible through organised women's groups. The Ethiopian Women's Voluntary Association, established in 1937, coordinated its members' work against the Italians, many of whom fought alongside the Patriots. Another organisation, the Ethiopian Women's Patriotic Union, directly aided regular Patriot forces. As co-conspirators with the Insider Patriots, members provided the resistance with food, medicine, clothing, arms and ammunition and intelligence. During Ethiopia's liberation, many women from the union took up arms. Others acted as lookouts, cleaned weapons on the battlefield or managed first aid stations.  History = Italian invasion  A couple months into the Second Italo-Ethiopian War on 9 December 1935, Ethiopian Minister of War Mulugeta Yeggazu ordered all chiefs in the north to undertake \\"patriotic resistance against the Italians for taking away the independence of Ethiopia\\". The Patriot movement only emerged in the spring of 1936 after the Battle of Maychew in the Tigray Region as scattered troops of the Army of the Ethiopian Empire resorted to guerrilla tactics against occupying forces. Local civilians joined in and operated independently near their homes. Early activities included stealing war materials, rolling boulders off cliffs at passing convoys, kidnapping messengers, cutting telephone lines, setting fire to administrative offices and fuel and ammunition dumps and killing collaborators. As disruption increased, the Italians were forced to deploy more troops to Tigray, away from the campaign further south. The Italians began referring to the Patriots as shifta, which roughly translates from Amharic to English as \\"bandit\\"; the word also has a connotation of \\"one who rebels against an unjust authority\\" and many freedom fighters reclaimed the label and took pride in its usage. On 4 May, Patriots led by Haile Mariam Mammo ambushed an Italian column in Chacha, near Debre Berhan and killed approximately 170 Askari and took four Italians prisoner, who were later released. Addis Ababa fell to the advancing Italians on 5 May 1936 and the Ethiopians withdrew to nearby areas to regroup; Abebe Aregai went to Ankober, Balcha Safo to Gurage, Zewdu Asfaw to Mulo, Blatta Takale Wolde Hawariat to Limmu and the Kassa brothers (Aberra, Wondosson, and Asfawossen) to Selale. Haile Mariam conducted hit-and-run attacks around the capital. Emperor Haile Selassie fled the country with 117 chests of gold ingots which were used to fund his court in exile and the Patriots' activities. Patriots during the guerrilla period. In the center is future Ethiopian general Jagema Kello. The emperor left 10,000 troops under the command of Aberra Kassa with orders to continue resistance. On 21 June, Kassa held a meeting with Bishop Abune Petros and several other Patriot leaders at Debre Libanos, about north of Addis Ababa. Plans were made to storm parts of the occupied capital but a lack of transport and radio equipment made it impossible to mount a coordinated attack. The deposed government in Gore was never able to provide any meaningful leadership to the Patriots or remaining military formations but sporadic resistance was undertaken by independent groups around the capital. On the night 26 June, members of the Black Lions organisation destroyed three Italian aircraft in Nekemte and murdered twelve Italian officials, including Air Marshal . The Italians had been hoping to gain support in the region by sending the party to talk with the local populace. The viceroy of the newly created Italian East Africa colony, Rodolfo Graziani, ordered the town to be bombed in retaliation for the killing of Magliocco (his deputy). Negative reactions from the locals forced Patriots to depart; Desta Damtew, the commander of the southern Patriots, withdrew his troops to Arbegona. Surrounded by Italian forces, they retreated to Butajira, where they were eventually defeated. A total of 4,000 Patriots are estimated to have been killed in the battles, of whom 1,600, including Damtew, were executed.  Occupation in Ethiopia  After the fall of Addis Ababa, Ethiopian resistance was increasingly confined to the mountains and it appeared to most observers that the populace was ready to accept occupation and co-operate with Italian authorities; Selassie was concerned that his compatriots would adjust to Italian rule. But Viceroy Graziani's harsh measures against the Patriots and the general repression that occurred during his tenure eroded support for conciliation. Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta was appointed by Mussolini to replace Graziani as Viceroy of Italian East Africa. He was more open-minded than his predecessor and well-suited to encourage the co-operation of the Ethiopian public, but by the time he assumed his responsibilities on 29 December 1937, Ethiopian opinion had soured on the notion of Italian domination. Though most of the original Ethiopian Army had been destroyed, a new resistance network was established in Amhara by aristocrats that had escaped persecution in Addis Ababa and Orthodox clergymen who were disturbed by the Italian overtures to the Muslim population. A rebellion was initiated in September 1937 in the Lasta region and in a few days was threatening the surprised Italian administration in Begemder and Gojjam. Well-armed Patriots seized numerous outlying residences and destroyed several entire Askari detachments. A number of Italian officers were also killed. Following the insurgency the Italian press ceased to report on combat operations in Ethiopia. In June 1938 Italian forces encircled Ankober and the surrounding highlands in an attempt to pacify resistance in the region. Haile Mariam was the only Patriot leader who decided to try and effect a break-out and with 500 men he assaulted the Italians in a futile attempt to breach their cordon. He was mortally wounded on 6 June during a major clash at Gorfo, Bulga district. On 2 December 1940, a Patriot force under Admique Besha raided the Italian garrison at Addis Alem. Seventy-eight Italian soldiers were killed and over 2,000 rifles were captured, along with several grenades and artillery pieces.

It is on permanent display at the Museo Soumaya.Fundación Carlos Slim in Plaza Carso, Mexico City, Mexico.  History  Still Life (1954) belongs to Tamayo’s most prolific period. It exemplifies the handling of color that is characteristic of his work. The rich tradition of still life painting in Mexico was not only continued, but also developed into a more modern form, culminating in the characteristic watermelon paintings produced by Rufino Tamayo in the course of his entire career. Still lifes and studies of fruits and foodstuffs have served many generations of artists as a basis for studying composition and the interrelation of volumes, textures, colors, light, and shadow. In the twentieth-century Mexico, Tamayo, like Paul Cézanne in fin-de-siècle Paris, brought this genre to one of its most complex and beautiful expressions. Both painters eschewed experimentation and sought the combination of different objects, or rather of their forms: apples, for Cézanne; watermelons, for Tamayo. For both artists, the forms were more important than the systematic study of the fruits themselves. Tamayo painted two mural for Sanborns to decorate the building acquired by the company in 1954, located on the Calle José María Lafragua at the corner of Paseo de la Reforma in central Mexico City. Still Life was intended to decorate the elegant restaurant room of the Sanborns chain, where the spectacular color contrasts of the mural could be enjoyed by diners. For thirty-two years, the watermelons stayed in the same place, until in 1986, at the invitation of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA), the mural was included in an exhibition organized as a national homage to Tamayo for seventy years of artistic creation. It was removed by the staff of the Centro Nacional de Conservación y Registro del Patrimonio Artístico Mueble of the INBA. When it was cleaned, the thick layer of grease attracted the attention of the restorers. The waiters at the restaurant explained that, when they used to clean the tables, they often gave the mural a wipe as well, in case it had gotten splattered. Unexpectedly, the layer of grease had protected the original colors. When it was cleaned, the brilliance of the original colors led Tamayo himself to confirm: “Yes, those are my colors.”  Description  The mural was painted on seven sheets of hardboard attached to the wall by means of a wooden frame. It was executed with pigments, the most modern material, suited to the technical and esthetic aims Tamayo wished to achieve. The painting depicts an angled table piled with red, round fruits, two bottles on a tray, and twelve slices of watermelon. In the foreground, the tops of the backs of two wrought-iron chairs can be seen, evoking the presence of the couple invited to enjoy the wine and fruit which, opulent and radiant, awaits the banquet. The fruits and objects, arranged in no order, are scattered over the table which, by its placement, recall the tables painted in Tamayo’s cubist period. The tapering angles toward the back lend a sensation of instability to the fruits resting on the table. These strike a point of balance, however, with the light emanating from a source outside of the composition, at the upper left corner. The position of the table, the outside light source, and the singular semicircular shape of the work, intended to be seen from below by seated diners, were all conceived originally by Tamayo as part of the mural composition. The sober and elegant coloring is limited to four tones: red, blue, green, and black. The ranges within these colors are carried, however, to their maximum potential, though it is the red of the apples and watermelons that predominate. The discreet greyish and whitish blue of the tray and bottles underlines the force of the red and white and helps to set off the gamut of reds and pinks of the slices of watermelon and the luminous red of the apples, which range from a vivid brilliance to a darker, blackish tone. The time when Tamayo was producing the greater part of his work coincided with a series of important social and cultural changes in Mexico, often reflected in mural paintings. Unlike the great masters of muralism, however, Tamayo sought to recover his Mexican roots without championing ideological stances or political movements. In short, his work expresses a universal vision. Other exhibitions This piece was exhibited at the Museo Reina Sofía in the solo exposition Rufino Tamayo Pinturas in 1988.

It is located just outside the old city walls, and is best known for housing for during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the Clarissan nun, Saint Camilla Battista da Varano. History The monastery was originally built by 1384, named Santa Maria Nova, and assigned to Olivetan monks, but in 1483, the Lord of Camerino, Giulio Cesare da Varano refurbished the monastery and assigned it to Clarissan nuns, which his illegitimate daughter, Camilla Battista, had joined. In 1484, along with eight other nuns from the Monastery of Urbino, Camilla Battista returned to Camerino, to occupy this monastery. She would serve as abbess for several years. However, her father fell afoul of the papacy, and the army of Pope Alexander VI, captured the town and executed her father and three half- brothers. She fled first to Fermo, but then to Atri in the then Kingdom of Naples. Here he learned the sad news of the massacre of his father and three brothers. It was able to return to Camerino only in 1503, after the death of Alexander VI, and the restoration of the properties confiscated from the Varano. Camilla Battista was to return briefly to Camerino, but in 1522 was sent to reorganize the Monastery of San Severino Marche. The structures in Camerino were nearly razed by the earthquake of 1799, and the nuns were expelled in 1810 by the Napoleonic occupation. They were able to return a decade later. They were again dispossessed in 1866, until regaining ownership in 1896. During the First World War, the monastery was used as a military hospital and the nuns moved to the Monastery of San Salvatore. Presently the a handful of nuns, derived from the Clarissan Monastery of San Severino Marche, are still associated with the monastery. The monastery suffered damage from the earthquake of 1977, and is still undergoing restorations.

It originates in the historical province of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro in north-eastern Portugal, and is a rare breed confined mostly to this area. History The origin of this breed conjoins the history of all the Iberian mastiffs, and its evolution is linked to the transhumance route on the Iberian Peninsula. In ancient times, this molossus dog was found in the high regions of Portugal, in particular in Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. The breed is used to improve pastoralism by developing it as a livestock guardian dog, particularly against Iberian wolf attacks, that are always prolific in the area. The breed has evolved over time with improved genetics through selective breeding for the conditions of pastoral farming. It is thought by some that the breed is related to the Tibetan Mastiff, but no proof of this exists. It is related to the Rafeiro do Alentejo, the southern Portuguese cattle dog, which \\"for many centuries\\" would follow the cattle herd in their migrations within the country. As those migrations were curtailed, the two breeds diverged. The breed also shares \\"some similarities with the short-haired Estrela Mountain Dog\\". In the mountains of Portugal, which are characterized by steep fields of pastures and difficult road access, this breed has adapted to the conditions of the region (i.e., may be classified as a landrace), and to the types of cattle, sheep, and goats that have traditionally grazed in these areas. Until the second half of the twentieth century, the region was primarily pastoral. This changed when the government of Portugal encouraged land clearance so that grain could be grown. However, many of those areas have returned to their previous use as pasture. This breed continues to guard extensive sheep flocks in the region, and more than 95% of the dogs are so employed. As of 1995, the breed was exclusive to Portugal, with no known exports to other countries, and was rarely seen outside of the northern Iberian peninsula. The breed has been imported to the US state of Oregon, as participants in an experiment to document the introduction and effect of \\"bigger\\" and \\"bolder\\" breeds than so-called \\"white dogs\\", i.e. the Great Pyrenees, Akbash and Maremma Sheepdog as a deterrent to predation by wolves. This occurred in large part because of the reintroduction of wolves to northeast Oregon. Since their return in 2008 through 2014, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife documented \\"86 fatal wolf attacks on livestock.\\" A similar experiment with cattle herds was conducted by the USDA in Montana.  Description = Coat and color  The breed has a short to medium coat with a dense undercoat, well adapted to the warm dry climate of the region. Generally the coat is white, with large patches of black, yellow, fawn, brindle or 'wolf grey'. It can also be of solid colour of fawn, yellow, wolf grey or brindle.  Size  This is the largest of the Portuguese breeds. It is a powerful, muscular and large breed with a broad muzzle and large head. Males range from , and weigh between . Females range from , weighing in between . They have moderately loose-fitting jowls and a single dewlap. Temperament They are first and foremost working livestock guardian dogs, and their development and temperament should be understood and appreciated in that context. This breed has a calm and reserved reaction to threats, and is notably curious and intelligent. An important attribute is its ability to work as a mixed pack with intact males and females; of course, younger males have to socialize to \\"temper their dominance\\" and adapt to working within the pack. They have a natural predisposition toward digging under fences and \\"expanding their territory,\\" which needs to be monitored and controlled. They are high energy fit, active, vigorous defenders of the flock, and well adapted to fending off wild boar, foxes, and wolves, which are the prevalent predators in the area. Feral dogs are another opponent. They are an \\"excellent night guardian.\\" \\"This dog is an athlete of all terrain able to make many miles along rugged landscapes, protecting both day and night his herd of possible threats. The largest of these is the Iberian Wolf, an endangered species that with the help of dogs of this breed can be preserved.\\" Representatives were selected and imported to the United States for a United States Department of Agriculture study on use of dogs to mitigate wolf predation in the western United States. They need large spaces and by nature like to roam free. They are ill-suited to being chained or apartment living. To cope with the heat, they like to burrow and make dens. They are a good companion dog. Females are generally more tractable and better companion dogs than males. Like most livestock guardian dogs, they bond with the flock; they are independent thinkers; and they must be trained to respond to their master's voice. Early training and socialization is essential. The breed association counsels: \\"... like all shepherds, the Transmontano Cattle Dog is a dominant dog and a 'single owner' [dog]. And because he is quite jealous and possessive, it is important to emphasize the importance of education and socialization....\\" They are possessive of toys and food, and owner control is essential. They are highly trainable and responsive to positive dog training techniques. They do not respond well to punishment, and have 'a long memory.' They are high energy dogs that require a lot of space. In the right environment they are very effective to protect an estate and flock. They are well adapted to protecting flocks (and perhaps herds) from wolves; their use is also seriously being considered for the western United States. Breed recognition In 2020, the FCI provisionally recognized the breed.Cão de Gado Transmontano. Federation Cynologique Internationale. Searched Mar, 15th 2020. There is also a small breed association, and the government of Portugal maintains a breed registry and facilitates placement of Cão de Gado Transmontano for flock protection from wolves through its agency Parque Natural de Montesinho. Grupo Lobo supports placement of these dogs to protect flocks from wolves; thereby helping to preserve the wolves (a protected species in Portugal) from human conflict. Wolf hybridization Hybridization with wolves is extremely rare.{{efn\\"Our analysis of a total of 204 wolves and 196 dogs using a set of 42 autosomal microsatellites revealed the existence of two well-defined clusters (Figs 3 and 4),implying that in Iberia the two entities are well- differentiated and that, despite a long coexistence, intro-gressive hybridization has apparently not been an important factor shaping both gene pools.\\" This includes the Transmontano.

As well as Still Life, it was originally produced for the perfumes and pharmacy section of the Sanborns store on Lafragua Street in Mexico City. Since 2011 it has been conserved in the lobby of the Museo Soumaya.  Description  Tamayo executed the work in 1954, employing the same technique used for the other murals in the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts), The Birth of Our Nationality and Mexico of Today. The mural contains abstract elements associated with the cosmos and with Mesoamerican architecture, with chromatic contrasts of red and black The work reflects Tamayo’s interest in space during the 1950s, as well as a growing involvement with Mexican history. It bears comparison with other Tamayo works such as Man Contemplating the Firmament and The Astronomer. During an inaugural visit to the mural, Tamayo told the poet Carlos Pellicer that the original title was to be “Day and Night over the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon,” to which Pellicer replied that it seemed the poet was Tamayo. On the occasion of the celebrations of seventy years of artistic production by Tamayo, the mural was taken from its original setting and exhibited in the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City before travelling to Madrid, Moscow, and Oslo. It was then removed from the Sanborns on Lafragua, on the recommendation of art critic Raquel Tibol. It was restored to its original brilliance and moved to the Museo Soumaya at Plaza Loreto in 1994 and then to Plaza Carso in 2011.

It has smooth, greyish or brownish bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, pale creamy yellow flowers and urn-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus peninsularis is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, greyish to brownish bark that is shed in ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, dull green, elliptical to egg-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are long and wide, have a ribbed, urn-shaped floral cup and a beaked to horn-shaped operculum. Flowering has been recorded in December and the flowers are pale creamy yellow. The fruit is a woody, urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves sometimes enclosed in the fruit, sometimes protruding strongly. Taxonomy Eucalyptus peninsularis was first formally described in 1997 by Dean Nicolle in his book, Eucalypts of South Australia. The type material was collected north-west of Cummins on the road to Mount Hope in 1972. The specific epithet (peninsularis) is from the Latin word peninsula, meaning \\"a narrow body of land\\", referring to the distribution on the Eyre Peninsula. Distribution and habitat Cummins mallee is restricted to south-central parts of the Eyre Peninsula, especially near the Cummins and Yeelanna areas where it grows in open mallee or woodland. Conservation status Eucalyptus peninsularis occurs in a mallee community complex, often with E. dumosa or E. calycogona. That complex has been rated as \\"poorly conserved in South Australia\\". Only small parts of that ecosystem have been conserved, including in Hambidge Wilderness Protection Area, the Verran Tanks Conservation Park and the Wharminda Conservation Park.

It is the third and final novel in the Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard trilogy, preceded by The Hammer of Thor. It was released on October 3, 2017 by Disney-Hyperion, an imprint of Disney Book Group. The novel is narrated in the first-person view by Magnus Chase, 16-year-old demigod and homeless orphan. He and his crew sail to the farthest borders of Jotunheim and Niflheim in pursuit of Asgard's greatest threat.  Plot summary Magnus Chase receives an ocean survival jumping lesson from Percy Jackson, a Greek demigod who is his cousin Annabeth Chase's boyfriend. The latter advises him, mentioning the possessiveness of sea gods over their weapons. Alex Fierro and Magnus travel to the Chase Mansion, where they recover notes, guarded by a wolf, scribbled by Randolph at different points of time. Alex feels that these notes hold the key to defeat their parent). After reaching Valhalla, Magnus summons a ship gifted by his father Frey. Mallory Keen, Halfborn Gunderson, Thomas Jefferson Jr., Samirah al-Abbas and Alex accompany Magnus, while they plan to pick up Blitzen and Hearthstone along the way. The crew's talk is heard by the Nine Billow Maidens, who take them to the court of Aegir, where they discover Hearth and Blitz are held prisoner and that Aegir was once humiliated by Loki himself in a flyting. Aegir's eldest daughter realizes Magnus' identity though very funnily, from his previous encounter with her mother Ran.Upon being threatened, Magnus swears by his troth to defeat Loki in a flyting contest and to avenge Aegir's humiliation, and the Sea God (Aegir) tells them to escape while he isn't looking and the crew is nevertheless attacked by Aegir's nine daughters. They escape with the help of Magnus' grandfather Njord who appears even though he is unwelcome but respected. Njord instructs them and tells Magnus that the only way to defeat Loki is by drinking Kvasir's mead. The crew continue on their journey, with Blitz and Hearth travelling separately to retrieve Bolverk's whetstone. As the crew heads to York, the backstories of the members are revealed. Mallory died disarming a bomb in Ireland; Halfborn died near Jorvik; TJ died after forcefully accepting a hopeless challenge (meaning he has to accept all challenges posed to him, whether he fails or succeeds), a trait inherited from his father Tyr. Samirah fasts during the Ramadan season. The crew arrives at Old York, where they duel (a tveirvigi) with the giant Hrungnir for the location of Kvasir's Mead. They get the information that they need: that the Kvasir Mead is in Jorvik (or Norway ,in the human world). Magnus later has a word battle on board Naglfar (ship made of nails) in which he wins not by insulting Loki but making his teamwork evident and his words make Loki shrink due to his evident faults and says that even among the midst of thousands, he is alone, as even his loyal wife Sigyn disappears from his side. Magnus wins due to which Loki reduces to the size of a nut and is imprisoned in a walnut given earlier by Frigg; Mallory's mother and the queen of Asgard, when she came to meet her in the train in Norway. Magnus and their friends travel back to Valhalla to meet their godly parents who congratulate them for defeating Loki and delaying the Ragnarok for which he is rewarded with a boon from Lord Odin. Magnus asks Odin to lend him his lawyers so that he could convert his mansion to an orphanage and home for the homeless. He later calls Annabeth and tells her his adventure and notices her, sobbing. Due to the death of Jason Grace.  Characters  * Magnus Chase (Beantown) - 16-year-old son of Frey who dies in the first few chapters but becomes an einherjar. He is Annabeth Chase's cousin, but last saw her when he was very young. He has healing and regeneration powers, resistance to extreme temperatures, and other magical abilities. As a human, he was asthmatic and weak, but gains extreme strength and endurance after his death. * Samirah Al- Abbas (Sam) - The Valkyrie who brought Magnus to Hotel Valhalla. A daughter of Loki, she emigrated from Iraq with her family and is descended from a medieval Arab traveler and historian who wrote an important account about living among the Vikings. She is stripped of her powers as a Valkyrie as a result of her choice to make Magnus an einherjar, but is reinstated by Odin himself. She is a practicing Muslim. She is a shapeshifter and carries an ax and a green hijab, which doubles as a camouflage cloak. She is engaged to Amir Fadlan, who works in a falafel shop. * Hearthstone (Hearth) - A friend of Magnus. He is an alf (elf). He is deaf-mute, but speaks Alf Sign Language and can read lips. He had an abusive childhood, with parents who disliked him because of his disabilities. In exchange for working for Mimir, he received the ability to work rune magic. * Blitzen (Blitz) - Another friend of Magnus, a svartalf (dwarf). He is the son of Freya. He and Hearth watched over Magnus while he was living in the streets. Blitz's father was killed by Fenris when he was a child, after an attempt to replace the Fenris Wolf's bindings. Blitz is unskilled at crafting (unusual for dwarves) but is a master fashion advisor. He, like Hearth, once worked for Mimir. * Mallory Audrey Keen (Mack) - Mallory Keen was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland to Frigg and an unnamed man. Mallory had a poor relationship with her father due to his alcoholism. On 21 July 1972, which later became known as Bloody Friday, Loki disguised himself as one of Mallory's friends and tricked her into installing a car bomb on a school bus, claiming that soldiers were onboard instead of children. Her mother, Frigg, knowing Mallory would die, appeared to her disguised as an old hag and convinced her to disarm the bomb, giving her two knives. The car bomb blew up, killing Mallory, but since she died a heroic death with a weapon in her hand, she was taken to Valhalla. * Halfborn Gunderson - A berserker extraordinaire, Gunderson left his hometown Flam to gain riches and glory and promised his mother he will be back to make their lives better. However, he never saw her again as she died in a mysterious fire. Halfborn Gunderson now fights as a Norse mercenary amongst his Enheirjar friends. * Alex Fierro - Alex's family is influential, which first attracted Loki's attention, causing him to seduce Alex's father in the form of a \\"voluptuous red-head\\". Nine months later, Loki left him with a child. The family didn't take the news well, especially after Loki permanently \\"opened their eyes\\" and made them aware of the Nine Worlds and the Norse gods. Alex spent her/his life being resented for her/his Norse heritage and for her/his gender fluidity, which was thought to be Loki's fault. Only her/his grandfather accepted her/him for who she/he was, and taught her/him how to make pottery. About two years before becoming an einherji, Alex became homeless and began to wander the streets of Boston. At some point in life, he/she lived in a youth shelter on Winter Street in Boston, at roughly the same time when Magnus was there. He/She remembers hating the place. * Thomas Jefferson Jr. - The son of Tyr, who died in a battle fighting during the Civil War. He also lives in Valhalla on the same floor as Magnus and all his friends.

He is the chairman of the Basic Law Institute, Hong Kong member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and vice-chairman of the Liberal Party. Biography Hoo was born in 1950 in Hong Kong and was educated at the St. Paul's College. He later studied law at London School of Economics and was called to the Bar in England in 1973 and in Hong Kong in 1975. He became Queen's Counsel in 1990. He was a member of the 400-member Selection Committee which was responsible for electing the first Chief Executive in 1996. The Selection Committee was replaced by the Election Committee in which Hoo has been a member through the Legal subsector until he was defeated in 2006. He returned to the Election Committee through Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) subsector in 2011, in which he has been a Hong Kong delegate of the national advisory body. He was made Justice of the Peace in 2002 and was awarded Silver Bauhinia Star (SBS) in 2004. Hoo had been the leading pro-Beijing voice in the legal sector. In 2010, he criticised the Civic Party and the League of Social Democrats launching the \\"Five Constituencies Referendum\\" movement to trigger a de facto referendum by resigning members of the Legislative Council from each constituency. He said the move challenged the Chinese sovereignty and urged the government to amend law to fill the loophole. In 2014 in response to the Occupy Central plan put forwarded by the pro-democrats to occupy the financial district in Hong Kong to pressure to the government to implement universal suffrage, Hoo said that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should act on the basis of the national security law with the vacuum left by the absence of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23. He joined the pro-business Liberal Party in 2015 during the time the party leader James Tien was stripped of his seat in the CPPCC after Tien urged Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying to consider stepping down at the height of the 2014 Hong Kong protests. He became the vice-chairman of the party in October 2016. In April 2016, Alan Hoo called on the Hong Kong government to immediately arrest members of newly-formed political parties, Demosisto and Hong Kong National Party (HKNP) of committing treason and sedition, over their advocacy on the Hong Kong independence. In May 2017, Hoo shocked the public when he said all Hong Kong underground spaces belong to China. The remarks came when he argued for the Chinese officers' right to enforce mainland laws beneath the ground level in the cross-border terminus of the Guangzhou- Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link Hong Kong Section. Hoo cited the 1997 decree by the PRC State Council which stipulated Hong Kong’s border details in which Hoo argued that the city’s autonomy only covered the land and sea \\"surfaces\\". Local legal professionals dismissed Hoo's remarks as \\"absurd\\" and legally erroneous. Personal life He married Flora Cheong-Leen, a fashion designer and daughter of politician Hilton Cheong-Leen in 1992, but the marriage lasted only three months. He remarried Yu Wai-man in 1999 and had two children. The couple divorced in 2008. He remarried Liz Kong Hei-man in 2012 and had a daughter together. In 2013, Hoo's mother Linda Chuan Yun-chuu called a press conference alleging that her only son had barred her from their Pok Fu Lam home and a home she owned in Shanghai. She also claimed that Hoo had refused to take her phone calls for six months or to return HK$11 million in cash. Hoo denied the accusations and stressed that he loved his mother very much.

No probate or estate records exist for Thomas, but he is known to have had a son Thomas Batte Jr. that died in 1691 in Henrico County and daughters Ann, Martha and Mary.  Land records  Thomas Batts and Abraham Wood (sponsor of the Batts-Fallam expedition in 1671 and Needham- Arthur expedition in 1673) were adjoining land owners as evidenced by a July 10, 1680 land grant to Maj. General Abraham Wood for 1,304 acres in Charles City County, Bristol Parish, for land on \\"the southside of the run of Appomattox River…& near the Indian town creek…opposite the lands of Mr. Thomas Batts.\\"Virginia Land Grants. Thomas Batte appears in a number of Henrico County records with William Byrd I, a well-connected fur trader and competitor of Abraham Wood. \\"Thomas Battes\\" appears with William Byrd as early as 1673 when he witnesses a transaction between William Byrd and Thomas Harris. On April 8, 1674, \\"Thomas Batts\\" patented a tract of 1,862 acres \\"on the North side of Appamattox River adjoining his own land above ye falls of ye Appamattuck Indian Towne to ye Old Towne Creek.\\"Peter Jones and Richard Jones genealogies [database on-line]. Provo, UT: The Generations Network, Inc., 2005. Original data: Fothergill, Augusta B. A portion of this patent was later sold when 100 acres were sold by Thomas Batte Sr. of Appamattuck in Henrico County, Gent. and his wife Mary to Gabriel Arther, planter, on September 13, 1684. On December 1, 1686, \\"Gabriell Arther\\" sold this same 100 acre parcel to Hon. William Byrd, Esq. On this same date, Thomas Batte Sr. and Thomas Batte Jr. sold approximately 1,100 acres (deed is ambiguous on this) of Thomas Batts' 1674 patent to William Byrd, Esq.  Exploration = Batts and Fallam expedition  On September 1, 1671, Thomas Batts (Thomas Batte), Thomas Wood, and Robert Fallam (Robert Hallom) set out from Appomattox Town (located near present-day Petersburg, Virginia), \\"accompanied with Perecute, a great man of the Apomatock Indians, and Jack Nesan, formerly servant to Ma.-Gen. Wood [Major General Abraham Wood], with five horses.\\" They were acting under a commission granted to Abraham Wood \\"for finding out the ebbing and flowing of the water behind the mountains, in order to the discovery of the South Sea\\" and authorized by the Virginia House of Burgesses. The Batts and Fallam group is credited with discovering Woods River, now called the New River.'America and West Indies: October 1671', Calendar of State Papers Colonial, America and West Indies, Volume 7: 1669-1674 (1889), pp. 263-271.

The Batts-Fallam Journel records that on September 17, 1671, \\"the Indians being impatient of longer stay, they proclaimed King Chas. the Second, and marked four trees, the first, C. R., for his Majesty, the second, W. B. William Berkeley, for the Governor, the third, A. W., for Maj.-Gen. Abraham Wood, and the last, T. B., R. F., for themselves, and P. for Perecute, who said he would be an Englishman, and on another tree are letters for the rest\\". The expedition returned to Fort Henry on Oct. 1. = The History and Present State of Virginia, in Four Parts = The History and Present State of Virginia, in Four Parts published in 1705 and written by Robert Beverly (coincidentally, son-in-law of William Byrd I, stated elsewhere herein) states that William Berkeley \\"was also resolv'd to make new Discoveries abroad amongst the Indians\\" and \\"For this End he employ'd a small Company of about Fourteen English, and as many Indians, under the Command of Captain Henry Batt, to go upon such an Adventure.\\" and \\"they set out together from Appamattox\\". He states that the \\"Indians which Capt. Batt had with him, made a Halt, and would positively proceed no further. They said, that not far off from that Place, lived a Nation of Indians, that made Salt, and sold it to their Neighbours. That this was a great and powerful People, which never suffer'd any Strangers to return, that had once discover'd their Towns. Capt. Batt used all the Arguments he could to get them forward, but in vain. And so, to please those timorous Indians, the Hopes of this Discovery were frustrated, and the Detachment was forced to return.\\" The publication references Capt. Batt numerous times, but only refers to Captain Henry Batt once. It is not known if the reference to Henry Batt was a misprint or a reference to an expedition other than the Thomas Batts and Robert Fallom expedition. = French and Indian War = In 1763, in negotiations following the French and Indian War, the Batts and Fallam exploration was used in treaty negotiations to bolster England’s claim to the Ohio Valley.  Needham and Arthur expedition  After the 1671 Batts and Fallam expedition, a subsequent expedition also sponsored by Abraham Wood was made by James Needham and Gabriel Arthur. The historical account of the expedition is contained in a letter from Abraham Wood to John Richards August 22, 1674.The expedition references \\"discoveries to the South or West sea in two years, which he was made sensible of by the hands of Thos. Batt (Thomas Batts) and Robert Fallam\\" and consisted of the two Englishmen and eight Indians sent out about 10 April 1673 to make discoveries across the mountains.\\"Carolina.

Arthur Gabriel went on to explore lands as far south as the western coast of Florida on the Gulf of Mexico. On the return trip he traveled west to the Mississippi River went upriver to the Ohio and up the Ohio to the mouth of Big Sandy River in Kentucky. He visited numerous Shawnee villages along the lower Ohio River, and is credited with being the first whiteman to visit Kentucky, and may have been the first person to navigate the Ohio River. He returned to Fort Henry on June 18, 1674.

At the age of 17 Koch began study at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes, but was dissatisfied with her experience there, and left after a brief time. On the suggestion of her parents, she went on to learn bookbinding, and worked at several bookshops in the immigrant milieu. Interested in both painting and sculpture, she subsequently studied privately with the artists Yolanda Mohalyi, Elisabeth Nobiling, Samson Flexor, and, beginning in 1947, Bruno Giorgi.\\"Eleonore Koch\\".

Beginning in 1949, she resided in Paris, and continued her studies under painter Árpád Szenes and sculptor Robert Coutin. Career Upon returning to São Paulo, in 1952, Koch worked as a set designer for the fledgling television station Tupi, and also found work at the University of São Paulo, as an assistant to the scientists Mário Schenberg and César Lattes. Through her acquaintance with the psychoanalyst, art collector and critic Theon Spanudis, she met the prominent modernist painter Alfredo Volpi, and from 1953 to 1956 pursued her art studies under him, shifting her focus during this period from sculpture to painting. Volpi greatly influenced her work, and she eventually came to be regarded as his only disciple. After her submissions to the São Paulo International Biennial (Bienal Internacional de São Paulo) had been repeatedly rejected in the course of the 1950s. from 1959 to 1967 she had work accepted into four successive biennials. In 1966 her career took a significant turn when, during a temporary stay in London, her work was accepted for an exhibition at the Mercury Gallery, and also drew the attention of the wealthy collector Alistair McAlpine, who became her sponsor for some years. As a result, Koch moved to London in 1968, and lived there for the following two decades. During this period she continued to develop and exhibit her art. Around 1976 she took a position as a Portuguese translator for Scotland Yard, and continued to work for the police for the next 13 years, enjoying the job for the many different stories it exposed her to. In 1989, at the age of 63, Koch finally returned to Brazil, a life change that led to her reconnecting to landscapes and colors in her art. Although until later years she remained little known to the general public, she achieved some recognition in artists' circles.von zur Mühlen, Patrik (2005). \\"Brazil, German Exile in.\\" In: Thomas Adam (Ed.), Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History.

History The church was built from 1233 to 1491 at the site of a prior church dedicated to San Tommaso di Canterbury (Thomas Becket). The Dominicans had come to Fermo after San Domenico di Guzman visited the town in 1214. The church has undergone numerous reconstructions. The present brick façade has a rose window and a single portal built in late-Romanesque-Gothic-style in 1455. The inner arch of the portal is rounded with a floral motif, while the outer border peaks in an acute angle. The niche in the pediment of the portal has a small statue of St Dominic. The façade remains unfinished. To the right, is a smaller door leading to an oratory dedicated to the Madonna of the Rosary. The bell-tower has gothic mullioned windows, restored in 1733. The interior has a single nave refurbished in 1846-1848 by the architect Luigi Fontana. The chapel of the Holy Sacrament once held the painting of the Last Supper by Nicola Antonio Monti. The main altar was consecrated in 1422 and made with travertine. The wooden choir stalls were carved in 1448 by Giovanni da Montelparo. The organ shutters have carved wooden baroque decorations from 1695, and gilded in the next century.

At the University of Washington, Peter Noble, Alex Pozhitkov and their colleagues recently (2016) confirmed that up to 2 days (48 hours) after the death of mice or zebrafish, many genes still function in their body.Williams, Anna (2016) “Hundreds of genes seen sparking to life two days after death (The discovery that many genes are still working up to 48 hours after death has implications for organ transplants, forensics and our very definition of death)”; New Scientist, 21 juin 2016, commentant un article intitulé “Genes get active after death” dont la référence est BioRxiv, DOI: 10.1101/058305; DOI: 10.1101/058370 changes in the quantities of mRNA in the body prove that hundreds of genes with very different functions awoke just after death 548 genes have thus awakened after the death of zebrafish and 515 in the laboratory mice. Among the genes which thus awake, there are genes involved in the development of the organism, including genes that are normally activated only in utero or in ovo (in the egg) during fetal development.  Applications  This information could possibly in the future lead to: * Construct a definition both more accurate and nuanced phenomenon of \\"death\\"; * More precise time of death by the forensic (or a biologist or veterinarian in an EcoHealth investigation who needs information on hours or causes of poisoning, without the case of a zoonosis for example.

This gene revival also means remaining in the cells for up to 48 hours after the death of these animals enough energy for activating the cellular machinery. At least part of these genes appear to be genes involved in physiological healing, healing or \\"auto-resuscitation\\". * Understand cancer. It was found that among the genes reactivated soon after death, some of the genes involved in the process of cancerous (reactivated with a peak of activity reaches about 24 hours after death) ; detailed understanding of this phenomenon could shed light on the phenomenon of carcinogenesis and maybe bring some new elements to better combat. * Improving the quality of organ transplants.

One hypothesis (yet to be verified) is that the cancer genes activated in the liver of the donor may also play a role. * Whether there is the same in humans, because previous studies have already shown that in people dead by trauma, heart attack or suffocation, various genes including those involved in cardiac muscle contraction and wound healing, were active more than 12 hours after death.González-Herrera, L., Valenzuela, A., Marchal, J.

Early life  Bart was born Avram Sholom (Sol) Strauser in Sambor, Poland (now Sambir, Ukraine). His family owned a bakery, and as a very young child, he would stand on a stool and sing to the customers. By the time he immigrated with his family to America in 1930 at age 11, he had already become a cantor and continued singing at religious services at various synagogues in Greater New York area.  Career  At age 17 he wanted to become a contestant on the renowned Major Bowes Amateur Hour radio show, the American Idol of its day and one of the most popular programs broadcast in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s. When he could not get an appointment, he and his high school friend Sid Bernstein went to the offices, found a piano, and accompanied himself to an aria from Pagliacci. Major Bowes walked in and was so taken with his voice that he completely changed the following Sunday's scheduled program to put him on. He won the contest and with it the opportunity to travel around the country with the Major Bowes’ touring group, thus supporting his family during the Depression. From there he went on to appear in nightclubs, cabarets, and theaters throughout the United States, including the Copacabana in Miami Beach, the Latin Quarter in New York, the Last Frontier in Las Vegas and New York's famed Palace Theater. Having been rejected from the Army for medical reasons, he contributed to the war effort by helping to sell War Bonds and singing for the troops. Bart recorded for RCA and Columbia among others, including a rendition of \\"We’re in Love, We’re in Love\\" with the Ray Charles Chorus, and later under his own label, Janson Records. He was a member of ASCAP (The American Society of Composers, Authors And Publishers) starting with his own composition, \\"Ecstasy\\" that he penned at age 20. Through the 1940s and ‘50s he was a regular on Yiddish radio shows, including the American-Jewish Hour, Yiddish Melodies in Swing'' and The American-Jewish Caravan of Stars on WHN and WMGM radio, along with the likes of the Barry Sisters, Molly Picon and Mickey Katz, with famed composer Abe Ellstein at the baton. His \\"Jan Bart Show\\" on WEVD radio in New York ran for 18 years and his \\"Jan Bart Show’ on WATV-TV for six. His many television appearances included the Milton Berle Show and the National Muscular Dystrophy Telethon with Jerry Lewis. He starred in the Yiddish film \\"Catskill Honeymoon\\" in 1950. When Israel became a state in 1948, Bart truly found his calling. He gave up his nightclub career to devote his whole life to the establishment and preservation of the State of Israel by working tirelessly for Israel bonds throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. In the early days selling Israel bonds meant riding along the boardwalk in the back of an open station wagon, pleading into a megaphone the lessons of the war, that the existence of the State of Israel was central to the survival of the Jewish people. In the early 1950s, while appearing in Miami Beach, he was asked to sing at the very first organized Israel Bond meeting. As gifted as he was a singer, he was an even better fundraiser, melding stories with his songs. His humor portrayed the new experiences of Jewish émigrés and stories from the mamaloshen. As Israel bond rallies developed into the organized, pre-sold events they are today, he always doubled and tripled the expected return. By his death at age 52 in 1971, he had raised more money for Israel Bonds than any other entertainer, having appeared at more than 2,200 performances over 20 years. Throughout his life he continued to use his cantorial skills, conducting High Holiday services at the Riverside Plaza Hotel each fall and returning to the \\"Borscht Belt\\" (the Catskill Mountains of New York), where, like so many Jewish entertainers, he had gotten his start, to conduct Passover services at Green's, Brown's, Young's Gap, and the Windsor hotels. Through the 1950s and 60's he made several recording albums, including Yinglish, old Yiddish melodies sung in English, and Fiddler on the Roof in Yiddish (see discography), for which he wrote the Yiddish lyrics. He published his biography with Barney Rubin, I Lost a Thousand Pounds (Oceanic Publications). He was a popular entertainer at weddings and bar mitzvahs, and there wasn't a family simcha that he and his wife, Lillian, didn't sing for. He officiated as cantor at just about every family wedding. He wrote individual anniversary songs for each occasion and sang \\"When did she get to be a beauty?\\" for every wedding and \\"When did he grow to be so tall?\\" for every bar mitzvah.  Stamp collector  Bart was a renowned Israeli and Judaica stamp collector and authority, writing several columns and articles for stamp newspapers and journals and judging international stamp competitions. He was the founder of the Judaica Historical Philatelic Society, which was created out of his own meticulous collection of Jews on Stamps.  Personal life  In 1941 Bart married singer Lillian Robbins, an operatic contralto, who performed as a soloist at Radio City Music Hall. Their children are Judy Bart Kancigor (1943- ) food writer and author of \\"Cooking Jewish (Workman Publications) and Gary Bart (1946- ), Weight Watchers founder in Orange and San Diego Counties and film producer (\\"In the Name of the People\\" and 'Invincible\\"). Lillian died in 2010 at age 93.  Death  Bart died at age 52 in 1971 from complications of diabetes. He is interred at Mt. Ararat Cemetery in Farmingdale, NY.

Yoskowitz and Liz Alpern, and published by Flatiron Books in 2016. It is primarily a cookbook which attempts to modernize Ashkenazic Jewish cuisine. The book contains 98 recipes. Background The Gefilte Manifesto draws its namesake from the mission statement of The Gefilteria, the business owned and operated by the authors. The word 'gefilte' is Yiddish for 'stuffed', and references gefilte fish, an Ashkenazi delicacy which is unpopular among American Jews. The book, and the recipes and discussions it contains, are expressly a rejection of mass-produced Jewish food, and the stigma which has come with it. Yoskowitz, who wrote his college thesis on the kosher food industry, has even called the kosher aisle at grocery stores \\"the place where Jewish food goes to die\\", and in The Gefilte Manifesto, he and Alpern attempt to make Jewish Cuisine accessible to home cooks without sacrificing convenience. The publishing of The Gefilte Manifesto coincides and contributes to what The New York Times called a \\"Golden Age\\" of American Jewish food, and in an interview with Joel Rose on National Public Radio, Yoskowitz stated that his and Alpern's mission was to \\"revitalize [Ashkenazi Jewish] cuisine\\". Reception The Gefilte Manifesto has been featured in numerous publications and media outlets, including The New Yorker, The Atlantic, National Public Radio, Forward, and +972. USA Today named The Gefilte Manifesto one of the top 16 food and beverage books of 2016. The Jewish Book Council named it a finalist for the National Jewish Book Award in Contemporary Jewish Life and Practice. Reviews have been positive. In J. The Jewish News of Northern California, Howard Freedman said of the book: \\"The emphasis is not on reproducing the foods of the shtetl. Rather, the thrust is on developing an appreciation of the foods and of the spirit of those who cooked them\\". Paula Forbes wrote in Epicurious: \\"There are... modern updates on classic flavors... So whether you're looking to preserve your own Jewish traditions or are simply a fan of borscht, this is the book for you\\". Bari Weiss, of The Wall Street Journal, said on NY1's The Book Reader: \\"Alpern and Yoskowitz recover and reinvent Eastern European Jewish classics and add a bunch of recipes that likely would have baffled their great-grandparents\\". Publishers Weekly, however, writes: \\"Some readers will be disappointed that Alpern and Yoskowitz, purveyors of a pop-up dining service called the Gefilteria, provide exactly three gefilte fish recipes\\", though it goes on to say: \\"The authors have actually dug deeper than the title implies, providing a comprehensive and joyful survey of Eastern European Jewish cuisine\\".

The genome sequence of the type species, O. rivulosa, was reported in 2016. Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed in 2012 by mycologists Otto Miettinen and Mario Rajchenberg. The three species are members of the Cinereomyces clade, a grouping of phylogenetically related fungi distinct from the core polyporoid clade. O. rivulosa was introduced to science by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1869 as Polyporus rivulosus. The type species, O. valdiviana, was originally described as a variety of Ceriporiopsis rivulosa by Rajchenberg in 1995. The genus was formally transferred to the new family Gelatoporiaceae in 2017. The generic name Obba alludes to the similarity of the bottle-shaped cystidioles characteristic of the genus to the household containers for liquids used in Rome. Description Obba species have crust-like fruit bodies that are white (when young) or cream to ochre (when dry). They range in length from a few millimetres up to long, and are about 3 mm thick. Obba has a monomitic hyphal system, containing only generative hyphae, and these hyphae have clamp connections. Habitat and distribution Obba causes a white rot in the trunks of both gymnosperms and angiosperms. Obba species have been recorded in subtropical and boreal zones. O. valdiviana occurs in southern Argentina and Chile, and has been recorded a couple of times from Australia. O. rivulosa is found in the Caribbean, Europe, North America, and South America. O. thailandica was described from Thailand in 2017. It was found growing on charred pine wood.

At 26, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. While still at the India Office, and having moved to Fulham with his mother and sister some years earlier, he took up the part-time post of editor at the local paper, The Fulham Chronicle, which launched in 1888. His thousand page illustrated, Fulham Old and New, was well supported and was published by subscription by the Leadenhall Press in 1900. In 1901, Féret not only left The Chronicle, but moved to Margate probably for better quality air and became an antique dealer. He never married, but adopted a young girl from an orphanage.

He won many international competitions and festivals.  Early life  He was born into the family of a dynastic priest. On his sixth attempt, he enrolled at the State College of Circus and Variety Arts in Moscow. The young candidate was supported by a well-known clown-mime Leonid Yengibarov, a member of the selection committee.Чтобы помнили. Борис Амарантов — Взлёт и падение  Career  In 1962 Boris graduated from the State College with the performance Ke-la-la (backing track Chella llà), which was staged by Sergei Kashtelyan.

The number was based on the combination and contrast of two pieces of music of the song \\"Top, Тop, Stomping the Вaby\\" by Tamara Miansarova and composition in rockabilly style called \\"I Want You to Be My Baby\\", performed by American singer Lillian Briggs.«Голубой огонёк» (1964) Борис Амарантов «Ке-ля-ля», «Берегите мир», реж. Сергей Каштелян (видео) Soon Amarantov created his own theater of pantomime where the performance Miracles in Нis Вag was created, staged by Grigory Chukhray, Mark Donskoy and Amarantov. The play was a success. Later Amarantov became a victim of the machinations of the Soviet bureaucratic machine: as a result of intrigues on the part of senior officials of the Ministry of Culture of the RSFSR, his theater closed repeatedly, and after its reestablishment, Amarantov himself was fired from it. After losing this job, he worked as a night watchman. In July 1975, he wrote a letter to the Supreme Soviet Presidium of a statement renouncing his Soviet citizenship and the requirement to give him the right to exit from the USSR to the West. He was refused in this request, was threatened and harassed. In August 1977, he emigrated from the USSR and arrived in the United States in November. Contrary to his hopes, Amaranth's hopes of a career as an actor in the USA did not materialize. He moved to France, where he attended the school of mime Marcel Marceau and successfully worked in Marceau's troupe, and also successfully toured many countries of the world. He lived mainly in France. Death After returning to the USSR, at the beginning of perestroika and hoping to re- direct, Boris Amarantov died under mysterious circumstances on March 3, 1987.

Its original title was Xochipilli- Macuilxóchitl, which is the double name of an Aztec god in two of his aspects, meaning \\"Flower Prince\\" and \\"Five Flower\\" (; ). History In connection with an exhibition titled Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art, held in May 1940 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the president of MoMA, Nelson Rockefeller, commissioned Chávez to assemble a programme of music for daily presentation, under the title Panorama of Mexican Music. In addition to arrangements of popular Mexican music from the recent past, Chávez composed Xochipilli-Macuilxóchitl to showcase pre-Columbian Aztec instruments. This score was completed on 12 May 1940 . Chávez conducted the premiere at the opening performance of the Museum of Modern Art exhibit four days later, on 16 May 1940 . In 1964 Chávez revised the score for publication. At this time he shortened the title to Xochipilli, and added the (English) subtitle, \\"An Imagined Aztec Music\\" . Instrumentation Aztec teponaztli (foreground) and huéhuetl (background) Aztec conch-shell trumpet Xochipilli is scored for ten players: piccolo, flute, E clarinet, trombone, and six percussionists playing a variety of instruments, many of Aztec origin: teponaztli, huéhuetl, omichicahuaztli. The piccolo and flute deputize for Aztec flutes of bone or clay, the E clarinet represents the clay ocarina, and the trombone is used as a substitute for the Aztec conch-shell trumpet . Programme In Aztec mythology, Xochipilli is the god associated with flowers, music, and dance, as is also Macuilxóchitl. \\"Their difference is esoteric. Macuilxochitl is the imperceptible god, an entity beyond the scope of human thought, a timeless being dwelling in the cosmos. Xochipilli is the embodiment of the same spirit on Earth, perceived in the visible, tangible, and edible world\\" . Analysis Xochipilli falls into three main sections, b. 1–83, 84–134, and 135–269, in an ABA' pattern. The two outer sections are in fast tempos (Allegro animato, = 100, and Vivo, = 104), surrounding a slow central section (Lento, = 58).

Many of his editorials were quoted nationwide in Reader's Digest, The New York Times, etc. and occasionally referred among professional journalists as \\"Dwellisms\\". He served as the president of the Washington State Publishers' Association in 1957–58, received multiple awards in journalism, and repeatedly represented Washington state in National Editorial Association.  Personal life  Three generations of Dwelleys: Charles Lemuel, Charles Muth (\\"Chuck\\"), and Art. Dwelley was born in Mount Vernon, Washington, on March 8, 1908, into the family of Charles Lemuel Dwelley (1878–1964) and Mary Elizabeth Muth Dwelley (1877–1954). He was often referred to as \\"Chuck\\" to distinguish him from his father. The family had two other children, Chuck's older sister Dorothy (born in 1905) and Chuck's younger brother William (born in 1916). Dwelley's father, Charles Lemuel, was the fourth child of Joseph F. Dwelley, one of the first settlers of Skagit County who arrived in Washington from Kittery, Maine, in 1870. Shortly after Chuck's birth, in 1910, the family moved to Anacortes, Washington, where Chuck's father worked at a pulp mill until his retirement. Chuck graduated from Anacortes High School in 1925. Dwelley was married three times. He married his first wife, Helen Lyle Grubb of Anacortes (born in 1910), on June 13, 1927. Following Dwelley's employment opportunities, the couple first moved to Sedro-Woolley, then in 1929, to Concrete, Washington, to work for The Concrete Herald. Their only child, Arthur \\"Art\\" Gilbert Dwelley was born on February 6, 1930. The couple lived on the top floor of the building where they published the newspaper most of their life until they divorced in the summer of 1961. Helen moved to Mount Vernon in July 1961 where she died in 1969. Dwelley remarried on January 1, 1962. His second wife, Alice May Hurn was born in Three Lakes, Washington, in 1913. A widow with four children, before moving to Concrete with Dwelley, she was a treasurer in the Shepherd of the Hills Lutheran Church near Three Lakes in Snohomish County, Washington. Alice died on May 6, 1967, at the age 54. On March 16, 1968 Dwelley remarried again. His third wife, Helen Lenore Pemberton (born on December 14, 1910) held a journalism degree from Washington State University. She worked at an internal publication with General Dynamics Corporation and left her job to live with Dwelley in Concrete. In the early 1990s, the couple moved to Tenino, Washington, to live with Dwelley's son, Art. Charles Dwelley died on September 30, 1993. He was buried in Pleasant Ridge Cemetery at La Conner, Washington. Helen moved to California, where she lived until she died on November 18, 2011, at almost 101 years old. She was buried next to Dwelley's grave in La Conner. All three of Dwelley's wives assisted him in writing for The Concrete Herald, and his son Art followed his father's trade. He also was a community activist; he edited and published another local newspaper, Tenino Independent, and later became a local historian until his death on October 10, 2000.  Career in journalism  Dwelley started his career as a journalist working for the Anacortes Citizen newspaper in Anacortes, Washington, where he lived since his early childhood. After his marriage, he moved to Sedro-Woolley to work for Courier Times. In 1929, his boss Frank Evans, the editor of Courier Times, sent Dwelley to Concrete, Washington, in an effort to save a failing local newspaper, The Concrete Herald which Evans just purchased.  The Concrete Herald  Evans and Dwelley assumed the ownership of the newspaper and its debts, reincorporating it in 1930. Shortly afterwards, the depression struck. The financial situation around the newspaper remained dire throughout the 1930s. In one incident, Dwelley invited his readers to pay for the newspaper issue that he couldn't publish due to medical reasons in order to help pay for his medical bill. Living with his wife and a new-born son in the same building where he operated Linotype machines, young Dwelley worked hard and managed to make the newspaper work, eventually paying out all the debts and buying out Evans' share. He is credited with \\"rescuing the failing Concrete Herald,\\" Many of his peers, including a fellow editor and a politician, Sim Wilson, noted Dwelley's accomplishment of maintaining a profitable newspaper in a small town. From 1930 to 1943, the population of Concrete slightly declined, but the number of Herald's subscriptions rose by 67%. = World War II interruption = On March 27, 1944, Dwelley learned that his younger brother William was killed in the European theater of war and voluntarily enlisted in the Navy. He received boot training at Farragut, Idaho, then graduated with honors from the Torpedo School at Naval Base San Diego as Torpedoman Third Class in December 1944. Dwelley was assigned to the Seventh Fleet and stationed in the Admiralty Islands. As it became apparent that the Navy has a surplus of torpedomen, in April 1945, he was assigned to Manila, Philippines, as a shore patrol officer. Dwelley returned to Seattle on a liberty ship on December 10, 1945, and was discharged at Bremerton, Washington, on December 16, after serving 21 months. During this time, Dwelley's wife, Helen Lyle, edited a truncated version of Concrete Herald from April 1944 to November 1944, but then couldn't keep up. From November 2, 1944, to May 31, 1945, the newspaper was completely suspended. = Libel controversy = In 1956, The Concrete Herald and Dwelley personally were sued for libel by Jacob Koops, a police judge of the city of Lyman, Washington, in connection to Dwelley's editorial comments published in July 1955 on the conduct of Koop's office. At that time, a Washington State Supreme Court decision imposed serious limitations on criticism in newspaper columns. The proceedings lasted almost three years, but the court eventually acquitted Dwelley and his paper, which Dwelley celebrated with an 80-point bold headline \\"WE WON\\", outmatching the headlines proclaiming the end of World War II. = Concrete Herald at its zenith = Since 1949, Dwelley's editorials editorials were cited on the radio throughout the country, reprinted in nationwide publications such as Reader's Digest and The New York Times, praised for its \\"wry sense of humor\\" and referred among professional journalists as \\"Dwellisms\\". Dwelley believed that editorials are an integral part of a local newspaper, and that editors should express their personal opinions to make local newspapers interesting and worthy. He also advocated in favor of short editorials as more effective means to deliver the point to the audience. In 1951, over 75% of Herald's subscribers were local residents of Concrete, but throughout the 1950s, The Concrete Herald subscription base was rising to include all upper Skagit Valley from Lyman in the west all the way to Newhalem in the northeast. In 1956, Herald was believed to be \\"one of the finest edited newspapers in the state.\\" By 1957, the circulation of Herald has exceeded the population of Concrete. Dwelley's editorials won first place awards of the Washington State Press Club two years in a row, in 1949 and in 1950. In 1952, he was at the center of attention again and labeled \\"Ladies' man\\" by his colleagues when Ladies' Home Journal picked Dwelley among four best editorial writers in United States. In the same year, Dwelley won the second place award from the Washington State Press Club for distinguished reporting. In 1951, Dwelley published a special 44-page edition of Concrete Herald commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the paper, for which he received first-place award from National Newspaper Association. From 1953 until 1957, Dwelley and his wife Helen themselves became judges of the Washington State Press Club contests. In 1958, when he was off the panel of judges Dwelley won another first place award for excellence in community service. The latest award the Dwelley received with Concrete Herald was the first place in Newspaper leadership contest in April 1970. = The sale of Concrete Herald and its aftermath = The Concrete Herald building on Main street in Concrete, WA occupied by local stores. It still carries the embellishments and the distinctive green color that Dwelley applied in the 1950s. In September 1970, just passed 40 years of editing the newspaper, Dwelley retired, selling The Concrete Herald to Robert and June Fader. Dwelley corresponded with the paper's new editors, praising occasional \\"scathing\\" editorials. In 1989, however, Herald's readers were \\"shocked\\" when the paper was sold to an opportunistic businessman with no experience in publishing, John Falavolito. In two years, The Concrete Herald failed and ceased publication. Eighteen years later, in 2009, a local resident of Concrete, Jason Miller, revived the newspaper in both paper and electronic formats. The successful resurrection of the paper version in the digital age came as a surprise for the publishing industry and reportedly \\"rejuvenated\\" local community.  Activity in journalist organizations  After Dwelley's editorials received national attention in 1949, he was given the floor to share his thoughts on newspaper editorials with the members of the Washington Newspaper Publishers' Association. In 1950, he was elected the secretary of the Association. On November 17, 1950, at the University of Washington, Dwelley was initiated in Sigma Delta Chi. Dwelley served on the Advisory Committee for the Washington Newspaper Publishers' Association in 1952–53 and on the Finance Committee in 1954–55. He was elected to serve as the vice- president of the Association in 1956–57, and, finally, its president in 1957–58. Dwelley represented Washington State in the National Editorial Association in the Freedom of Information Committee in 1953–54 and in Editorial Page Committee in 1956–57.  Retirement  After the Herald's sale in 1972, Dwelley's family moved to La Conner, Washington, where he continued writing and editing. For years, Dwelley kept writing a column \\"The Bridge Tender\\" for a local newspaper, Channel Town Press and published and edited a few history books, including a history of Concrete (And they called the town Concrete) and Skagit Memories. He was also elected an honorary lifetime member of Washington Newspaper Publishers' Association, occasionally attending its gatherings.  Activism  In addition to editing and publishing The Concrete Herald, Dwelley was actively engaged in the local community. Since 1929, for 40 years, Dwelley had been fighting the dust pollution of Superior Portland Cement Company which operated a large cement plant in Concrete. Led by Dwelley, the community group from Concrete has successfully involved senator Lowell Peterson, conducted a dust emission study that proved a pollution level more than ten times over acceptable levels, and eventually pushed for creation of Northwest Air Pollution Authority. Five days after the first meeting of the State Air Pollution Control Board, the plant operator made a decision to close down the plant completely. Dwelley also fought for the development of local infrastructure, and from 1948 he led the campaign that resulted in the construction of the North Cascades Highway. He was elected president of the North Cross-State Highway Association in 1959 when the construction project was underway. Through his editorials, Dwelley successfully campaigned for the construction of the first bridge across Skagit River in the upper valley. In August 2006, a plaque honoring Dwelley's efforts was mounted on this bridge. For several years, Dwelley also presided over the Concrete Chamber of Commerce. In 1960, Dwelley received Lions Clubs International award for his community services to Concrete.

The police have used Project Servator tactics in London, on the national rail network and at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, V Festival and shopping centres. Project Servator is an inclusive collaborative community strategy that relies on local people and businesses to be the eyes and ears for the police. It encourages residents and staff to be vigilant and to be the eyes and ears for the police and to ensure safety and security. The police have used information campaigns to support these deployments. These exercises are based on highly visible police patrols designed to identify and deter potential criminal activity, ranging from pickpocketing or theft to more serious crimes, including terrorism. Project Servator deployments are characterized by the use a range of policing assets - dogs, mounted branch, firearms, plain clothes – in an unpredictable way. Research indicates that visible policing makes the public feel more reassured and Project Servator arrest figures show it has been effective in identifying criminals. Overview In February 2014, in response to the public perception of increased levels of crime and the threat of international terrorism the City of London Police launched a new public policing initiative called 'Servator' or 'Project Servator.''Project Servator' is an inclusive collaborative community strategy that aims to protect local areas and build upon the safety and security plans already in place to ensure safety and security. It is based on a partnership approach, where the police engage local communities and businesses, encouraging vigilance among residents and staff working in that area. Police seek to work closely with as many parts of the community as possible and briefings often include; local pubs and retailers, bus, rail or taxi firms and their drivers and homeless hostels. Project Servator's approach is the highly visible and unpredictable deployments of police assets. These may be the deployment of specially trained officers – uniformed and plain- clothes, dogs, horses coupled with the heightened use of CCTV. It involves increasing existing levels of community engagement, to encourage people to be vigilant and to report anything suspicious. It has included media engagement, poster advertisements in transport hubs or in roadside and telephone boxes, as well as leaflets placed in shops and cafes. In each case, the police force concerned, provides the public with telephone numbers to call if they see anything suspicious. As the public feel more reassured by a visible policing on the streets, the aim of Servator is to make the police footprint very visible and very obvious. The police do so by a deployment of policing assets that are unpredictable in time, location and in asset used. One day dogs and handlers may be patrolling, the next the mounted branch may be visible, the next there may be a batch of six or seven officers patrolling an area, another day, there will be no one. There could be officers patrolling with private security teams, there could be officers working alongside CCTV teams with officers on the ground in the area being surveyed. Project Servator may involve using undercover officers trained in behavioural analysis to spot people who might be scoping out sites for a potential terrorist attack. Officers' expertise is in noticing the subtle, sometimes unconscious ways in which people behave differently when they are stressed or anxious. Background City of London Police Van The planning, research and development behind Project Servator comes from three years of work with the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) \\\\- as part of its role to reduce the vulnerability of the national infrastructure to terrorism and other threats and to help protect public places – and the City of London Police who developed an initial Servator pilot scheme. Cranfield University helped provide the research to evaluate the impact of Servator as part of its role to reduce the vulnerability of the national infrastructure to terrorism and other threats and to help protect public places. The most significant threat comes from international terrorism with its ambitions to mount high impact attacks combining mass casualties with substantial disruption to vital services such as energy, transport and communications. Cranfield University's Professor Paul Baines said: \\"In psychology, reciprocity is a powerful mechanism. Most of us can relate to the idea that if we receive something from someone, we feel almost a need to 'return the favour', and are likely to do so.\\" Heightened public awareness of a potential threat is perceived as a 'favour' as it is protecting the public from danger. So the \\"UK police forces…use the notion of a favour/fear appeal to offer benefit to citizens and thereby encourage them to report suspicious activity.\\" Project Servator's growing prominence in the public mind seeks to enable police to better \\"tactically engage with the public, 'by recruiting' them, and by encouraging them to be vigilant and more eager to report suspicious behaviour.\\" Professor Baines has spoken about the importance of \\"reassurance communications\\" by the police as an important aspect of encouraging the public to report suspicious activity. Cranfield University recently provided an assessment of Project Servator and concludes that police reassurance communications (RComms), branded as Servator, inform, reassure and recruit the general public (and potentially deter criminals/terrorists). The communications are designed as a social marketing campaign that uses a partnership approach with the local community. [] Impact The City of London Police attribute the success of Servator to a more scientific approach to behaviour detection. Officers are trained to notice the subtle, sometimes unconscious ways in which people behave differently when they are stressed or anxious and do so in the course of conducting hostile reconnaissance. People displaying signs of nervousness are approached, or stopped, and questioned and if the officers become even more suspicious, they can then use their 'stop and search' powers. The \\"conversion rate\\", or the proportion of people searched who then go on to be arrested when this technique is used, jumped from 20 to 68 per cent during the two years it was used by City of London Police. Between February 2014 and June 2016, City of London Police officers on Servator deployments carried out a total of 738 searches. Of these, 442 searches proved positive, resulting in 403 arrests and 171 vehicle seizures, with drug offences being the most common. Use of tactics within London Since the launch of Project Servator in February 2014, the City of London Police have been deploying the tactic across the Square Mile, as the City of London is known. Project Servator was launched on the streets of London in November 2016 by the Metropolitan Police as a way of deterring anyone planning to commit any form of crime from shoplifting to terrorist attack planning. This deterrence is in the form of unpredictable, irregular deployment of plainclothes officers, the use of dogs, boat units and other forms of territorial police support. Scotland Yard stressed the move was not in response to a specific threat, however, in 2017, following a bomb on the District Line train at Parsons Green, there had been a government promise to enhance police presence in areas across London. An additional objective of these deployments by trained officers is the desire to encourage people to become extra eyes and ears for the police. The police want to persuade them to readily report any suspicious behaviour that they may see. One such example came in August 2017, when the Met Police Task Force, working with British Transport Police, made a major swoop at Stratford station and seized a long bread knife, a hammer and an imitation gun. The photographs of the weapons taken off those detained were shared on social media and the story was covered by both the national press and on Twitter. Publicity of the arrests and the sharing of the weapon images on social media was expected to reinforce public confidence and increase the likelihood of people calling in intelligence on suspicious behaviour which Project Servator teams can then act upon. Project Servator has also played an important role in building public trust and support during 2016 and 2017 as several terrorist attacks hit London. In late 2016, officers were patrolling London boroughs looking for signs of suspicious activity as part of Project Servator deployments and police in London were doing so again as part of Operation Temperer, which began shortly after the Manchester Arena terrorist attack in May 2017. Additionally, Project Servator means a greater police presence is in place at transport hubs in east London with London City Airport seeing Project Servator deployments in and around the airport. Police Boat Use of tactics outside of London Since the international terrorism threat level was raised to severe in 2014, Project Servator tactics have been used on several occasions: the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, V Festival, Intu Lakeside and One New Change also at transport hubs nationally, and around critical national infrastructure as well as around military sites such as Sellafield Aldermaston and HMNB Portsmouth, Naval Base by the Ministry of Defence Police Terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 and Brussels in 2016, have led to forces in other urban areas, such as the Metropolitan Police Service and Greater Manchester Police, to examine the potential of Servator as a police scheme to heighten public awareness and strengthen public security. On 7 November 2016, Project Servator launched at London Stansted Airport with Essex Police aiming to set up highly-visible, yet unpredictable, police deployments designed to disrupt and deter criminal activity in and around the airport. Servator was planned to be used to improve security at some of Britain's biggest train stations and high-profile buildings. Surveillance City of London Police The police have used information campaigns to support the deployments. An example of Professor Paul Baines’ psychological approach of reassurance communications, is one of the poster headlines that reads \\"We love rush hour, it gives us 300,000 extra pairs of eyes\\". Discussing this poster, the magazine of the creative industry, the Drum writes \\"It employs public information and deterrence communications techniques. The core emotive colours of red, white and black provoke an emotional response and distinguish the posters – even in busy environments. And the strapline 'Together, we've got it covered' makes the overall message inclusive while also sending a warning to criminals or malicious individuals.\\" The Mayor of London echoed the same \\"eyes and ears\\" message. Sadiq Khan said \\"Nothing is more important to me than keeping Londoners safe. As a father of two daughters, I worry about my family going about our city just as I worry about all Londoners.\\" This was said as part of his press statement when he attended a Servator deployment at Liverpool Street linked to his terror preparedness review. The introduction of anti-terrorism police patrol units was announced by Scotland Yard on 28 November 2016. Mounted Police Increase in March 2016 In March 2016 it was announced that an extra £1.6 million a year would be raised by City firms for anti-terror measures to protect the capital's financial centre. The funds were to support more armed police, collaboration with businesses, community groups and other organisations on protective security and the further development of Project Servator. Essex In the summer of 2017, Project Servator was launched at Lakeside shopping centre and Stansted Airport and was intended to operate across the county. Supt. Adrian Coombs, Essex Police commander at Stansted Airport: \\"One of the key element of Project Servator is unpredictability, so don’t be surprised if you see a visible police presence pop up at various times and locations across the whole airport using different resources.\\" Essex Police has adopted a range of tactics to support its Servator deployments throughout the county. The tactics include things that the public can observe:high visibility police, drones and firearms officers who engage with the public, dogs, CCTV and helicopters as well as things they can't observe, such as plain-clothes officers. Essex Police works with partners, stakeholders and other forces at Lakeside and the airport to keep those areas safe and to prevent all types of crime, from the high level organised crime down to shoplifting. At Stansted Airport, a full-time team is deployed - both in the terminal – airside and landside - and in and around the perimeter. So one moment the Essex Police may be seen at a Plane Spotters gathering at Stansted Airport, then they could pop up policing inside the Stansted Terminal building itself. November 2017 saw the launch of Project Servator deployments in and around Colchester. Essex Police in Colchester is working with security staff, retailers and Colchester Council's zone teams. The Essex Police said this is about reassurance, community involvement and keeping people safe in a garrison town with a military presence, the objective being to deter both potential criminal and terrorist activity throughout the town. Security on UK Rail Network North Yorkshire The North Yorkshire Police announced implementation of Project Servator policing methods in April 2017. The launch had been in the planning since 2016 with the decision to launch in April being based on Project Servator's successful adoption by Police Scotland at the 2014 Commonwealth Games and a more recent pilot project by the local North Yorkshire Police. Project Servator in North Yorkshire is aimed at protecting crowded places, key locations and events from criminal and terrorist activity. It was launched in York to be then rolled out across the county. The tactics involve the use of visible and covert police officers, firearms, Automatic number-plate recognition, air support, mounted officers and CCTV cameras. On 16 May 2017, North Yorkshire Police extended Project Servator deployments to patrolling key areas of Catterick, home to Europe's largest military base, when uniformed and undercover officers took to the streets of Catterick to mark the project's launch. On 23 August 2017, to mark the first anniversary since launch North Yorkshire Police have produced a video showing the work of Project Servator. The force explained the purpose of the video is to assist 'those who are not aware of Project Servator' and it 'introduces businesses and the local community to the concept of Project Servator and explains the important role businesses and the community have to play in making this project a success.'  Scotland  Police Scotland used Project Servator in the lead up to and during the course of the Edinburgh International and Fringe Festival 2017. Project Servator was also used at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Scotland, where organizers described Project Servator as a '10,000-strong army of police, military and security personnel to protect fans and athletes during Games.'  Sellafield  Since 2016, Project Servator has been used at Sellafield Ltd to protect the facility and the surrounding areas. Like Servator in urban areas, it uses a combination of visible and non-visible tactics in an unpredictable way to deter criminal threats. The police tactics being used are overt, covert and firearms officers, dogs and vehicles which are complemented with Sellafield Limited's operational security and community vigilance in and around the site. CNC Officers have also given presentations about Servator to local schools and colleges and community groups.  Ministry of Defence  Project Servator is also used by the Ministry of Defence Police (the MDP). Following trials at the Atomic Weapons Establishment and Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMDB) Portsmouth the new policing initiative has been introduced. Portsmouth Dockyard AWE Chief Inspector Charlie Franks - speaking at the Senior Leader's Conference - described Project Servator as 'Effects- Based Policing' and said it was being adopted as MDP's Operational Policing Model. The model appears to be working with the Ministry of Defence Police reporting a positive knock-on effect in reducing criminality in the wider community outside the wire at Aldermaston. Additionally, the model has been adopted at HMNB Portsmouth where officers work closely with the local community to gain information and explain the purpose of Servator deployments. In 2017, the model was adopted within the Clyde group (Faslane and Coulport) in Scotland. Officers involved in Servator deployments have set up patrols, for limited periods, within the naval base. They have done so at the various points of entry to the establishment being guarded. They have also pushed out into the wider community including railway stations, ferry ports and shopping centres. The purpose of these deployments is to make the environment perpetually hostile to would-be criminals and keep the community safe. Sir Ben Ainslie joined a Project Servator deployment at the naval base and said \\"Nice to bump into these two coppers doing a great job keeping Britain safe.\\" #Projectservator@HMNBPortsmouth Police forces working together In 2017 officers from the City of London Police carried out examinations of vehicles and passengers at a check point on the northern side of the bridge where eight people were killed and 48 injured in the London Bridge attack on 3 June 2017. This operation was part of Project Servator which had been stepped up in response to the spate of terror attacks since the Westminster Bridge attack in March. The operation concentrated on offering a hostile surveillance and security presence on bridges over the River Thames in the capital, due to the risk of repeat attacks, while the terror threat across the country was severe. A week earlier, the City of London Police and Ministry of Defence Police carried out a similar check point operation at Tower Bridge, when a suspected illegal immigrant was arrested. In a similar fashion North Yorkshire Police has undertaken joint deployments with the York Minster Police and the Royal Military Police. The Ministry of Defence Police officers were joined by colleagues from Hampshire Police at Her Majesty's Naval Base Portsmouth.

Completed in 1894, it is still standing.  History  At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, the area around Maiden Lane and John Street became home to a number of early skyscrapers built speculatively to house businesses attracted to the booming financial district, which was expanding north. Maiden Lane was already established as the center of the city's jewelry district as early as 1795, and the area near Broadway was a busy shopping district. In 1892, Manhattan real-estate developers Abraham Boehm and Lewis Coon announced that they had acquired the property at 14 Maiden Lane and intended to demolish the existing structure, replacing it with a ten-story tower specifically intended for the diamond trade. At the time, the planned building would be among the tallest in the city, as elevators and new building techniques permitted ever higher construction and the city's rapid growth created an insatiable real-estate market. Design and construction Boehm and Coon hired prolific New York City architect Gilbert A. Schellenger to design the building for the specific requirements of diamond merchants and jewelers. The building was of fireproof construction, with a cast-iron and steel frame, and hollow-brick floor arches. The frame and floors were made unusually strong in order to accommodate the heavy safes required by the trade, large windows provided ample daylight, augmented by gas and electric lights, and the facade was ornately decorated. Constrained by the narrow lot, Schellenger emphasized the building's slenderness with three slim brick colonnettes flanking the large bay windows on the building's face. The tall, narrow building towered over the older, neighboring structures. Cast-iron and steel construction were both relatively new techniques, and construction of the Diamond Exchange suffered a major setback in October 1893 when a powerful windstorm caused the incomplete cage to shift about from plumb. The problem was eventually traced back to oversized holes in splices on the cast-iron columns. Each new story added to the cage permitted additional movement, and the force of the wind was sufficient to cause the whole structure to tilt. To resolve the problem, the builders were forced to install \\"knee braces\\" at the ceiling line of each story, converting the original unbraced cage to a braced design. In 1904 the same flaw led to the collapse of the eleven-story Darlington Hotel, also in New York, which killed 25 construction workers. Construction was completed in 1894 and the building was occupied by jewelers and diamond dealers. The ground floor, decorated in polished granite, was leased to retail tenants; in 1915 it became home to Tessaro's, a dealer in rare books. One year after it was completed, the developers sold the building for $375,000 (it had cost approximately $275,000 to build). While many early skyscrapers have been demolished or dwarfed by modern neighbors, the Diamond Exchange, , still stands above the adjacent buildings. In 1920, the buildings to the east were destroyed in a fire which killed several people. The buildings to the west were demolished in 2015 to make way for a planned hotel.

Cloyne was also the \\"see city\\" of the Anglican (Church of Ireland) Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross. The tower is a symbol for the town of Cloyne. History The monastic settlement at Cloyne dates to about 560 AD, when Saint Colman mac Lenene (who died in 604) founded the original monastery. The round tower itself dates to around the 10th century, and is approximately 30m high and 16.25m around when measured about 1.5m above the ground. The stone in the tower is dark purple sandstone. As with some other round towers, a lightning strike caused some damage to the top of the tower. The strike was in 1749. There is also the ruin of a Norman watchtower on a hill overlooking the town. The town has a cathedral from its time as a religious centre, as well as a more recent church. The Church of Ireland Cathedral dates to 1250 A.D. The local Catholic church, St. Colmans, was built in 1815. The round tower was used to hang the Cathedral bell in the 19th century.
