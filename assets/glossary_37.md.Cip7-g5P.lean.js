It lies along the border between the U.S. states of Minnesota and South Dakota. A low continental divide separates the land at the southern shore of Lake Traverse from Big Stone Lake, the headwaters of the south- flowing Little Minnesota River, which is part of the Mississippi River System. Both lakes lie within a mile of the town of Browns Valley, Minnesota with Wheaton, Minnesota (at the north end of Lake Traverse); and Ortonville, Minnesota (at the south end of Big Stone Lake). Lake Traverse is an Anglicization of Lac Traverse, a French name meaning \\"across the lake\\". Prehistorically, the south end of Lake Traverse was the southern outlet of glacial Lake Agassiz across the Traverse Gap into Glacial River Warren; that river carved the valley now occupied by the present-day Minnesota River. Lake Traverse is drained at its north end by the northward-flowing Bois de Sioux River, a tributary of the Red River of the North. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam at the outflow regulates the lake's level. The Mustinka River flows into the lake just above the dam.

The film is a comedy, falling into the peculiar Hong Kong genre of Mahjong films, and was released during the Lunar New Year of 2002. Plot Andy is an extremely compulsive Mahjong player. Thrown out of the house by his mother and ignored by his more academically gifted and successful younger brother, Louis, he had a hard time running away from debt collectors. One day he met a woman named Gigi after a run-in with some of the debt collectors' men. Gigi started out as a thief, but because she fell for him and gave him immense luck, Andy gained great success with his extreme good luck in mahjong games and became very rich. However, he refused to marry Gigi because she, though a nice woman when with him, was a sore loser who threw temper tantrums when on the verge of losing mahjong games. She could not understand that he couldn't stand the way she behaved. As Andy said, her behaviour could be revealed by just playing a game of mahjong where when she lost: She would throw the tables. He promised her that he would marry her if she could play a game of mahjong without such a bad temper. She couldn't and so he couldn't marry her though he loved her. In the meantime, Andy found his mother who was now suffering from Alzheimer's disease. His brother faced bankruptcy and moved in with Andy, who lived in a bungalow. Not wanting to lose out in finding a job, Louis who had excellent luck in mahjong but zero skill, was conned out of all his money and even his clothes by a skilled, devious mahjong player, Sean (portrayed by Lau Ching-wan). A kind-hearted simpleton, a woman on the con team, (Cherrie) fell for him and decided to mend her ways. Gigi, who was very disappointed with Andy's refusal to marry her, went with the bad crowd, in the form of the mahjong con men led by Sean. Andy who was cursed by Gigi lost his winning streak and instead found a living as a taxi driver; he moved into public housing. Being ever optimistic, he did not complain. However, not wanting Gigi to fall into the con men's trap, he played a game of mahjong with Sean and lost terribly. Gigi was touched by his actions and went back to him, promising she will return a better woman. Before she left, she gave Andy a blessing and, from there on, Andy's winning streak came back. Louis, who had created a mahjong computer game with his new girlfriend (Cherrie), received word that there would be a mahjong tournament sponsored by his game. The ever optimistic Andy decided to join the contest which saw him competing against Sean. Before the tournament began, he discovered that Gigi had returned to her old job as a flight attendant and gave him good fortune items from around the world. During the tournament, Andy was able to secure a seat in the final match which included Sean, Sean's father, and a henchman. Andy easily won the match but was confronted by Sean to have a rematch. Andy agreed and the two squared off. Before the match could end, Andy gave the prize to Sean. Sean, surprised, looked at Andy's hand, which was a major breakthrough set. Sean realized all his mistakes and decided to learn from Andy. Andy regained all his money and started a mahjong school by the sea. He eventually married Gigi.

Although he had received a good education, he served throughout the early part of the French Revolutionary Wars without rising above the rank of private. In 1797, however, the attention of Talleyrand, then minister of foreign affairs, was called to his exceptional abilities by General Huet, and he was attached to the diplomatic service. After serving in the legations in Switzerland and the Cisalpine Republic, he was appointed in 1799 attach to the French legation at Berlin, of which three years later he became charg√© d'affaires. As minister-plenipotentiary at Cassel, between the years 1804 and 1806, he took a prominent share in the formation of the confederation of the Rhine; and after the battle of Jena he returned to Prussia as administrator of the public domains and finances. He filled a similar function in Austria after the battle of Wagram. At the end of 1810 he became French resident at Warsaw and was for a couple of years supreme in the affairs of the grand duchy. The preparation of a constitution for Poland, on which he was engaged, was, however, interrupted by the events of 1812. Bignon, after a short imprisonment at the hands of the allies, returned to France in time to witness the downfall of Napoleon. During the Hundred Days he once more entered Napoleon's service, and, after the battle of Waterloo, as minister of foreign affairs under the executive commission, it was he who signed the Convention of St. Cloud of the 3rd of July 1815, by which Paris was handed over to the allies. Bignon did not re-enter public life until 1817, when he was elected to the chamber of deputies, in which he sat until 1830, consistent in his opposition to the reactionary policy of successive governments. His great reputation and his diplomatic experience gave a special weight to the attacks which he published on the policy of the continental allies, two of his works attracting special attention, Du congr√®s de Troppau ou Examen des pr√©tentions des monarchies absolues √† l‚Äô√©gard de la monarchie constitutionnelle de Naples (Paris, 1821), and Les Cabinets et les peuples depuis 1815 jusqu‚Äô√† la fin de 1822 (Paris, 1822). The July Revolution, which brought his party into power, only led to a very temporary resumption of office by Bignon. He was for a few weeks minister of foreign affairs in the first government of Louis Philippe, and again for a few weeks minister of public instruction. But the idea of making him responsible for the foreign policy of France could not be realized owing to the necessity under which Louis Philippe lay of courting the goodwill of the powers, whom Bignon had offended by his outspoken writings.

This history, while suffering the limitations of all contemporaneous narratives, contains much that does not exist elsewhere, and is one of the best-known sources for the later histories of Napoleon's reign.

The company, particularly known for its high-quality bone china, having produced tableware and ornamental items since approximately 1750. It was known as 'Derby Porcelain' until 1773, when it became 'Crown Derby', the 'Royal' being added in 1890. The factory closed down in the past under Royal Doulton ownership, but production was revived under the renewed ownership of Hugh Gibson and Pearson family.  History  = William Duesbury I and II = Three figures dated 1758 - now in Detroit Institute of Arts In 1745 Andr√© Planch√©, a Huguenot immigrant from Saxony, settled in Derby, where between 1747 and 1755 he made soft-paste porcelain vases and figurines. At the beginning of 1756 he formed a business partnership with William Duesbury (1725‚Äì1786), a porcelain painter formerly at Chelsea porcelain factory and Longton Hall, and the banker John Heath.The original agreement survives in the Victoria and Albert Museum. This was the foundation of the Derby company, although production at the works at Cockpit Hill, just outside the town, had begun before then, as evidenced by a creamware jug dated 1750, also in the possession of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Planch√© disappeared from the scene almost at once, and the business was developed by Duesbury and Heath, and later Duesbury alone. A talented entrepreneur, Duesbury developed a new body which contained glass frit, soapstone and calcined bone. This enabled the factory to begin producing high-quality tableware. He quickly established Derby as a leading manufacturer of dinner services and figurines by employing the best talents available for modelling and painting. Figure painting was done by Richard Askew, particularly skilled at painting cupids, and James Banford. Zachariah Boreman and John Brewer painted landscapes, still lifes, and pastorals. Intricate floral patterns were designed and painted by William Billingsley. In 1770, Duesbury further increased the already high reputation of Derby by his acquisition of the famous Chelsea porcelain factory in London. From this point the Derby paste included bone ash.Honey, 150 He operated the Chelsea factory on its original site until 1784 (the products of this period are known as 'Chelsea-Derby'), when he demolished the buildings and transferred the assets, including the stock, patterns and moulds, and many of the workmen, to Derby. Again, in 1776, he acquired the remainder of the formerly prestigious Bow porcelain factory, of which he also transferred the portable elements to Derby. In 1773, Duesbury's hard work was rewarded by King George III, who after visiting the Derby works granted him permission to incorporate the royal crown into the Derby backstamp, after which the company was known as 'Crown Derby'. In 1786, William Duesbury died, leaving the company to his son, William Duesbury II (1763‚Äì1796), also a talented director, who besides keeping the reputation of the company at its height, developed a number of new glazes and body types. = Michael Kean = William Duesbury II did not live to fulfil his promise: he died in 1797 at the age of 34 and the company was taken over by his business partner, an Irishman named Michael Kean, who later married Duesbury's widow. He seems not to have enjoyed good relations with the highly skilled workforce, and many eminent artists left. Others however produced good work under his management, including Moses Webster, a flower painter who replaced Billingsley, Richard Dodson (who specialised in birds), George Robertson (land- and seascapes) and Cuthbert Lawton (hunting scenes). The best-known artist of this time was William Pegg, a Quaker, famed for his striking and idiosyncratic flower painting. He started in 1797 but his religious beliefs led him to the conclusion that painting was sinful and he left in 1800. He returned in 1813, but left again in 1820. Despite much good work, the Kean period was disruptive and the company suffered financially. William Duesbury III, born in 1790, son of William Duesbury II, took over the factory when he came of age, and Kean having sold his interest to his father-in-law, William Duesbury's grandfather, named Sheffield, the concern continued under the name of Duesbury & Sheffield. = Robert Bloor = Crown Derby Imari plate, 19th century Biscuit tin in the shape of a stacked pile of Derby porcelain plates. Made by Hudson Scott & Sons for Huntley & Palmers, 1906 In 1815, the factory was leased to the firm's salesman and clerk, Robert Bloor, and the Duesburys played no further part in it. Bloor borrowed heavily to be able to make the payments demanded but proved himself to be a highly able businessman in his ways of recouping losses and putting the business back on a sound financial footing. He also possessed a thorough appreciation of the aesthetic side of the business, and under him the company produced works that were richly coloured and elegantly styled, including brightly coloured Japanese Imari patterns, generally featuring intricate geometric patterns layered with various floral designs. These designs proved extremely and lastingly popular, and Derby continued to thrive. In 1845, however, Bloor died, and after three years under Thomas Clarke, the Cockpit Works were sold and the factory closed in 1848. = King Street = A group of former employees set up a factory in King Street in Derby, and continued to use the moulds, patterns and trademarks of the former business, although not the name, so keeping alive the Derby traditions of fine craftsmanship. No mechanical processes were used, and no two pieces produced were exactly the same. Among the items preserved was the original potter's wheel of the Duesburys, still owned by the present Royal Derby Company. = Osmaston Road = In 1877, an impressive new factory was built by new owners of the Crown Derby name in Osmaston Road, Derby, thus beginning the modern period of Derby porcelain. Crown Derby's patterns became immensely popular during the late Victorian era, as their romantic and lavish designs exactly met the popular taste of the period. = Royal Crown Derby = In 1890, Queen Victoria appointed Crown Derby to be \\"Manufacturers of porcelain to Her Majesty\\" and by royal warrant granted them the title \\"The Royal Crown Derby Porcelain Company\\". In 1935 Royal Crown Derby acquired the King Street factory, thus reuniting the two strands of the business. = Allied Potteries = In 1964, the company was acquired by S. Pearson and Son and became part of the Allied English Potteries Group, later to be joined by Royal Doulton. In 2000, Hugh Gibson, a former director of Royal Doulton and a member of the Pearson family, led a buy-out, making Royal Crown Derby once again an independent and privately owned concern, which at present (2006) employs about 300 people at the Osmaston Road works. Present product lines include paperweights, introduced in 1981 and immensely popular. Royal Crown Derby also continue to produce patterns in the Imari style, distinguished for its rich colours and intricate gilding, including the dinnerware ranges Old Imari, Traditional Imari, Red Aves, Blue Mikado and Derby Posies (designed by Thomas Amos Reed, Art Director until he retired in 1926), and Olde Avesbury. In 2013, Hugh Gibson retired and sold the company to Steelite International of Stoke-on-Trent. The Derby factory and visitor centre remain open. According to the Royal Crown Derby website, Steelite \\"remains firmly committed to the highest quality UK manufacture and sets its sights on launching into a new market with a new brand ‚ÄòRoyal Crown Derby Entertains‚Äô providing fine bone china tableware to major hotels restaurants and hospitality venues throughout the world.\\" In 2016, the company was bought by Kevin Oakes, formerly chief executive of both Crown Derby and Steelite.

Major types of tankship include the oil tanker, the chemical tanker, and gas carrier. Tankers also carry commodities such as vegetable oils, molasses and wine. In the United States Navy and Military Sealift Command, a tanker used to refuel other ships is called an oiler (or replenishment oiler if it can also supply dry stores) but many other navies use the terms tanker and replenishment tanker.  Description  Tankers can range in size of capacity from several hundred tons, which includes vessels for servicing small harbours and coastal settlements, to several hundred thousand tons, for long-range haulage. Besides ocean- or seagoing tankers there are also specialized inland-waterway tankers which operate on rivers and canals with an average cargo capacity up to some thousand tons. A wide range of products are carried by tankers, including: * Hydrocarbon products such as oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and liquefied natural gas (LNG) * Chemicals, such as ammonia, chlorine, and styrene monomer * Fresh water * Wine * Molasses * Citrus juice Thomas W. Lawson (1902), converted in 1906 into the world's first sailing tanker. Tankers are a relatively new concept, dating from the later years of the 19th century. Before this, technology had simply not supported the idea of carrying bulk liquids. The market was also not geared towards transporting or selling cargo in bulk, therefore most ships carried a wide range of different products in different holds and traded outside fixed routes. Liquids were usually loaded in casks‚Äîhence the term \\"tonnage\\", which refers to the volume of the holds in terms of how many tuns or casks of wine could be carried. Even potable water, vital for the survival of the crew, was stowed in casks. Carrying bulk liquids in earlier ships posed several problems: *The holds: on timber ships the holds were not sufficiently water, oil or air-tight to prevent a liquid cargo from spoiling or leaking. The development of iron and steel hulls solved this problem. *Loading and discharging: Bulk liquids must be pumped - the development of efficient pumps and piping systems was vital to the development of the tanker. Steam engines were developed as prime-movers for early pumping systems. Dedicated cargo handling facilities were now required ashore too - as was a market for receiving a product in that quantity. Casks could be unloaded using ordinary cranes, and the awkward nature of the casks meant that the volume of liquid was always relatively small - therefore keeping the market more stable. *Free surface effect: a large body of liquid carried aboard a ship will affect the ship's stability, particularly when the liquid is flowing around the hold or tank in response to the ship's movements. The effect was negligible in casks, but could cause capsizing if the tank extended the width of the ship; a problem solved by extensive subdivision of the tanks. Tankers were first used by the oil industry to transfer refined fuel in bulk from refineries to customers. This would then be stored in large tanks ashore, and subdivided for delivery to individual locations. The use of tankers caught on because other liquids were also cheaper to transport in bulk, store in dedicated terminals, then subdivide. Even the Guinness brewery used tankers to transport the stout across the Irish Sea. A US Navy T2 tanker in 1943 Different products require different handling and transport, with specialised variants such as \\"chemical tankers\\", \\"oil tankers\\", and \\"LNG carriers\\" developed to handle dangerous chemicals, oil and oil-derived products, and liquefied natural gas respectively. These broad variants may be further differentiated with respect to ability to carry only a single product or simultaneously transport mixed cargoes such as several different chemicals or refined petroleum products. Among oil tankers, supertankers are designed for transporting oil around the Horn of Africa from the Middle East. The supertanker Seawise Giant, scrapped in 2010, was in length and wide. Supertankers are one of the three preferred methods for transporting large quantities of oil, along with pipeline transport and rail. Despite being highly regulated, tankers have been involved in environmental disasters resulting from oil spills. Amoco Cadiz, , Erika, Exxon Valdez, Prestige and were examples of coastal accidents. Design considerations Many modern tankers are designed for a specific cargo and a specific route. Draft is typically limited by the depth of water in loading and unloading harbors; and may be limited by the depth of straits along the preferred shipping route. Cargoes with high vapor pressure at ambient temperatures may require pressurized tanks or vapor recovery systems. Tank heaters may be required to maintain heavy crude oil, residual fuel, asphalt, wax, or molasses in a fluid state for offloading. Tanker capacity Tankers used for liquid fuels are classified according to their capacity. The small coastal tanker Pegasus on the River Weser The Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) in 2008, after her capture by Somali pirates In 1954, Shell Oil developed the average freight rate assessment (AFRA) system, which classifies tankers of different sizes. To make it an independent instrument, Shell consulted the London Tanker Brokers‚Äô Panel (LTBP). At first, they divided the groups as General Purpose for tankers under ; Medium Range for ships between 25,000 and and Large Range for the then- enormous ships that were larger than . The ships became larger during the 1970s, and the list was extended, where the tons are long tons: *10,000‚Äì: Small tanker *25,000‚Äì34,999 DWT: Intermediate tanker *35,000‚Äì44,999 DWT: Medium Range 1 (MR1) *45,000‚Äì: Medium Range 2 (MR2) *55,000‚Äì: Large Range 1 (LR1 *80,000‚Äì: Large Range 2 (LR2) *160,000‚Äì: Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) *320,000‚Äì: Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC) ; Very Large Crude Carrier size range At nearly 380 vessels in the size range to , these are by far the most popular size range among the larger VLCCs. Only seven vessels are larger than this, and approximately 90 between and . File:Distribution of supertanker sizes.png Fleets of the world ; Flag states As of 2005, the United States Maritime Administration's statistics count 4,024 tankers of or greater worldwide. 2,582 of these are double-hulled. Panama is the leading flag state of tankers, with 592 registered ships. Five other flag states have more than two hundred registered tankers: Liberia (520), The Marshall Islands (323), Greece (233), Singapore (274) and The Bahamas (215). These flag states are also the top six in terms of fleet size in terms of deadweight tonnage. ; Largest fleets Greece, Japan, and the United States are the top three owners of tankers (including those owned but registered to other nations), with 733, 394, and 311 vessels respectively. These three nations account for 1,438 vessels or over 36% of the world's fleet. ; Builders Asian companies dominate the construction of tankers. Of the world's 4,024 tankers, 2,822 (over 70%) were built in South Korea, Japan and China.

It stars Malcolm McDowell as Flashman. Additionally, Oliver Reed appeared in the role of Otto von Bismarck, Alan Bates as Rudi von Sternberg, and Florinda Bolkan played Lola Montez. Fraser wrote the screenplay and the film was directed by Richard Lester. Though it received good reviews for its performances and action scenes, Royal Flash had only a limited release in cinemas.  Plot summary  The film begins with Flashman making a patriotic speech to the boys of Rugby School framed by a giant Union Flag, in a scene which appears to be a parody of the opening sequence in the 1970 film Patton. There is a brief flashback to the events of the original Flashman, with the head of the Rugby School (Michael Hordern) recounting Flashman's exploits in Afghanistan. The film then follows the plot of the book, which itself largely derives from The Prisoner of Zenda. Flashman is forced by Otto von Bismarck to impersonate a Danish prince, who is about to marry a German princess (Britt Ekland). Bismarck exacts this retribution partly in revenge for his humiliation at the hands of Flashman in London; Flashman stole Bismarck's mistress Lola Montez, then manoeuvred him into boxing against a professional boxer, John Gully (played by Henry Cooper), at a house party. Bismarck does not wish the Princess to marry a Dane, since this may tilt the balance on the Schleswig-Holstein Question and interfere with his plans for a united Germany.

At one stage Richard Lester was to direct, but the necessary financing could not be secured. However, Lester enjoyed the novel and then hired George MacDonald Fraser to adapt The Three Musketeers for two successful films in the early 1970s. This enabled Lester to obtain finance for a Flashman film. Royal Flash was the second Flashman novel, and had been published in 1970. The New York Times said \\"Mr MacDonald Fraser has considerable narrative skill... most ingeniously plotted and often hilariously funny.\\"\\"Royal Flash\\" by Ricard Boston. New York Times 18 Oct 1970: BR3. Diabolique argued the second novel was chosen for filming as opposed to the first because it would be less expensive, and the basic storyline had been successfully used before. The film was one of the first produced by executive David Picker following his resignation from being head of United Artists in 1973.\\"Warner's to Distribute Films of David Picker\\" Los Angeles Times 21 Nov 1974: h23. In 1969 John Alderton had been cast as Flashman and he has a small role in Royal Flash. But the lead in was played by Malcolm McDowell. The film was shot partly on location in Bavaria.\\"Movie fan's guide: Photogenic Bavaria\\" Jim; Higgins, Shirley. Chicago Tribune 12 Oct 1975: c11. It introduced actors Bob Peck, and Christopher Cazenove. The film was cut from 118 minutes to 102 minutes prior to release. Among the scenes lost were flashbacks to Flashman's life at school, and the entire role of Roy Kinnear. Reception The Observer said the film \\"leaves one breathless not so much with enchantment as with boredom\\".\\"Cut-price Errol Flynn\\" Milne, Tom. The Observer 13 July 1975: 21. The Wall Street Journal said it was \\"disappointing\\".\\"Victorian England Is Skewered Again\\" by Joy Gould Boyum. Wall Street Journal 6 Oct 1975: 12. Lester said the film was \\"generally ignored and considered to be a substandard version of The Three Musketeers. It was perhaps a poor choice of mine to pursue because it was a period film, a comic romp with some serious overtones and a lot of swordplay and it did come after Musketeers which was a well loved piece of subject matter.\\" Lester also felt \\"that equivocal anti hero wasn't easy to take. They wanted a real hero, a hero that was a bounder as well as a hero. And Malcolm McDowell was absolutely 100% bounder - the sleaze was coming through to the film.\\" Diabolique magazine argued the film suffered from miscasting in key roles, lack of voice over and for perhaps not being the best introduction to Harry Flashman for cinema audiences. Despite the film's disappointing reception, Lester said it was one of the few films he made that he liked watching again. In 1981 Fraser's daughter Caro Fraser said \\"I was with him [her father] the last time he saw the film - and he was so embarrassed by it that he spent the whole time with his head in his hands.\\"Flash point!

Geography It is situated 6 kilometres east of the central business district of Dartmouth and takes its name from Cole Harbour, a natural harbour fronting the Atlantic Ocean. Cole Harbour is adjacent to and immediately east of the former city boundary of Dartmouth; prior to municipal amalgamation and the creation of the Halifax Regional Municipality in 1995, Cole Harbour was an unincorporated village within the Municipality of the County of Halifax. Because of amalgamation in the Halifax region, Canada Post recognizes most of Cole Harbour's residents as living in neighboring Dartmouth. Transportation The centre of Cole Harbour is at the intersection of Forest Hills Parkway and Route 207 (Cole Harbour Road). A small business district is situated along Route 207 with several residential subdivisions such as Forest Hills and Colby Village located north and south of this road. The Forest Hills Parkway links the community to Highway 107, while Cole Harbour Road becomes Portland Street further to the west in Dartmouth and links to Highway 111. Extensive residential and commercial development took place during the 1970s and 1980s following completion of Highway 111 and the widening of Cole Harbour Road. In the early 1900s, this section of roadway 207, east of Portland Estates Blvd. to the junction of 328, or Ross road was referred to as the \\"BreakHeart Hills\\" which runs through the community of Cole Harbour to Upper Lawrencetown. There are several Metro Transit bus routes connecting Cole Harbour with Dartmouth and Halifax, including MetroLink bus rapid transit service. Until the mid-1980s, CN Rail operated a rail line from Dartmouth to Upper Musquodoboit with part of the route crossing the southern edge of the community. The abandoned rail corridor was converted to a rail trail named the Salt Marsh Trail and is part of the Trans Canada Trail.

V. Pandit. It stars Chandrachur Singh, Om Puri, Tabu and Jimmy Sheirgill in the lead roles. The film portrays the circumstances surrounding the rise of the Sikh insurgency in Punjab in the 1980s and traces the transformation of a youth from a boy next door to an angry person bent on wreaking vengeance, upon receiving gross injustice from the political system and sidelined being labelled as terrorist, to make it easy to kill him without any state accountability. The title is used as a metaphor that conveys that the youth of any nation are matchsticks that could ignite due to deficiencies in the political and policing systems. Maachis was a critical and commercial success. Gulzar's direction and the music of Vishal Bhardwaj were strong points. To this day, many songs from the film, particularly \\"Chappa Chappa Charkha Chale\\" and \\"Chhod Aaye Hum Vo Galiyaan\\" can be heard playing on FM radio or TV channels. Bhardwaj went on to become a director and has directed movies such as Maqbool as well as the highly lauded Omkara. \\"Chhod Aaye Hum\\" was the first Hindi film song sung by the now famous Indian singer KK. Maachis is a film about what atrocities can drive an ordinary human to do. It looks back at the Punjab problem and tries to figure out some of the root causes.  Plot  The story is set in mid-to-late 1980s in the Indian state of Punjab which had been wrecked by a violent insurgency in the aftermath of Operation Blue Star, the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and the subsequent 1984 Anti-Sikh riots. The story is relayed by a series of flashbacks. Jaswant Singh Randhawa (Raj Zutshi) and his sister Veerendar \\"Veeran\\" (Tabu) live with their elderly mother Biji in a small village in Punjab. Kripal Singh (Chandrachur Singh) is Jaswant's childhood friend and Veeran's fianc√©. He lives close by, with his grandfather. Their peaceful lives are interrupted by the police led by Assistant Commissioner of Police Khurana and Inspector Vohra, searching for Jimmy (Jimmy Sheirgill), who allegedly had attempted to murder Kedar Nath, a member of the Indian Parliament. Jaswant mockingly leads the police to his dog named Jimmy. Angered by his insolence, Khurana and Vohra take Jaswant for questioning; he fails to return for days. Kripal struggles to locate Jaswant, visiting police stations in the area, while taking care of Jaswant's family. When Jaswant finally returns after 15 days, he has been badly beaten up by police, which enrages Kripal. Unable to obtain help by any legal means to fight police brutality, Kripal sets off to locate his cousin Jeetay, who had ties with militant groups. Unable to locate Jeetay, Kripal instead encounters a man named Sanathan (Om Puri), whom he observes planting a time-bomb on a bus. Running into him again at a dhabha, Kripal asks a wary Sanathan to listen to his woes. Sanathan agrees to let Kripal travel with him on his truck being driven by the \\"Commander\\" (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) and carrying sacks of home-made bombs and two militants. Upon arriving at their hideout, Kripal explains his predicament and finds out that Jeetay was killed by the Commander himself for being a police informer. Fully aware of Kripal's background, family and his predicament, the Commander rebukes Kripal for coming to them as if they were professional killers. He tells him to kill Khurana himself and the group would protect him. Kripal slowly earns the respect of the rest of the group and Sanathan, who explains that he is not fighting for a nationalist or religious cause, but for his basic civil rights and self-respect. Sanathan says that he is fighting against a system that victimises innocents and de-values ordinary people. It is later learned that Sanathan is a survivor of the communal violence that occurred with the Partition of India in 1947, wherein he lost most of his family in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Sanathan claims that it is the ruling class that is trying to divide society by religion for political gain. Kripal trains with the group and plots the killing of Khurana. After a year, he assassinates Khurana in a busy marketplace. Before going into hiding, he visits Jaswant and Veeran one final time, both of whom are horrified at his deed. When Kripal returns to their hideout, he finds it empty. After a while of staying in hiding, he is contacted by a member of the group and is taken by the Commander to the group's new hiding place in Himachal Pradesh. The Commander informs Kripal that he is known to the police, who had taken Jaswant in for questioning again. Kripal slowly begins to realise that there is no return to a normal life and finds solace in the company the unit, which is now preparing for a new mission and awaiting the arrival of a missile firing specialist. When thinking of applying for a local job, Kripal is warned by Sanathan that he is now a big-time terrorist in the eyes of the media and a means of promotion for police officers. One of the group members, Kuldip, narrowly escapes a confrontation with the police while trying to illegally transporting some explosives, sustaining injuries. Terrified by the experience, he pleads to Sanathan to let him go home, promising to emigrate to Canada. Sanathan reluctantly agrees. While the rest of the unit believes Kuldip is heading home, a bomb planted in his backpack explodes and kills him on his way home. Meanwhile, Kripal learns that one of his comrades, Jaimal Singh, is none other than the Jimmy the police had been looking for. Soon afterwards, the missile shooter arrives and Sanathan introduces Veerendar. Kripal is shocked to find that Veerendar is his fianc√©e, Veeran. After they finally speak together alone, Kripal is horrified to learn that Jaswant, taken in for questioning after Khurana's murder, was beaten viciously and driven to commit suicide in the jail. His mother died soon after learning of this tragedy, leaving Veeran alone. After receiving daily visits from Inspector Vohra, Veeran decided to follow in Kripal's footsteps and try to reunite with him. Kripal and Veeran begin to grow close again. Veeran is a welcome addition to the household, bringing the simple joys of normal life to the band of outlaws and developing a close friendship with the others, especially Sanathan and Wazir. The mission is revealed to be a plot to assassinate MP Kedar Nath, who had survived Jimmy's assassination attempt, as he arrived for a visit to a local Sikh shrine. During their stay together, Kripal and Veeran decide to get married quietly. Veeran quietly steals the cyanide pill from Kripal that each of the group members has and is supposed to use if ever caught by police. While visiting the Sikh shrine to begin reconnaissance, Kripal spots Inspector Vohra, who has been put in charge of security for Kedar Nath's visit. Kripal tracks Vohra to the house where he is staying but, while attempting to kill him, is caught by Vohra and arrested by police. Meanwhile, one of the group members spots Kripal entering Vohra's residence. Arguing that if Kripal had been loyal, he would have taken the cyanide pill to kill himself, Sanathan concludes that Kripal was a police informer. Sanathan also accuses Veeran of helping Kripal and orders her into house-arrest. On the day of the mission, Sanathan orders the group to move and tells Wazir, who is guarding Veeran, to kill her. However, Veeran breaks free and kills Wazir. In the meantime, Jaimal and Sanathan execute the plot. Jimmy is killed while stopping Kedar Nath's motorcade on a bridge while Sanathan fires the missile to blow up Kedar Nath's car. On the run, Sanathan finds himself being tracked closely, not by the police, but by Veeran. Veeran kills Sanathan and escapes. The film concludes with Veeran, who has not been exposed as a member of the group, visiting Kripal in prison. Here she gives Kripal his cyanide pill and later takes her own.

The group performs both nationally and internationally, at private venues, colleges, and high schools alike. Over the years, the group has arranged numerous contemporary and modern pieces, and now has more than 200 recorded covers of popular music. They generally do not use any instruments in their recordings, and instead carefully select different pitches to simulate the tones needed for each song. This often means recreating sounds such as the high-pitched tone of the fiddle in \\"The Devil Went Down To Georgia\\" or the bass and snare of the drum set in \\"All Along The Watchtower.\\" Several former members of the Dissipated Eight have gone on to gain national prominence, including international opera performer William Burden, television and film actor Jake Weber, and author/editor Peter Knobler. Origin Formed in the Fall of 1951, the original group consisted of seven singers, including Pete Baldwin (Tenor I), Ellis Baker and Les Streeter (Tenor II), Bob Johnson and Pete Gray (Baritone), and John Ackerman and Ed Opler (Bass). By February, the seven were practicing regularly in Painter and Hepburn Halls. However, it was not until March 15, 1952 that the D8 performed its debut concert at the Ides of March Dance. Later that spring, the group performed at a radio broadcasting where the WRMC announcer, Bob Arel, noting the double quartet (which had no name at the time) was short by one, jokingly introduced the group as \\"The Dissipated Eight.\\" The following year, the group added four new members Mint Dole (Tenor I), John Hammond and Jack Harrington (Baritone), and Seward Highley (Bass) to replace the graduating seniors Bob Johnson, Pete Gray, and Ed Opler.

McKillip and the second book of the Riddle Master trilogy. It was published in 1977.  Plot summary  The focus shifts from the previous protagonist of Morgon of Hed to Raederle of An. Raederle, the titular heir of sea and fire, was promised by her father to the man who won a riddle game with a ghost. In the previous book, this was revealed to be Morgon. As the book opens, Morgon has been missing for a year; with Morgon presumed dead, his power over the land of Hed has passed on to his heir. Raederle sets out for Erlenstar Mountain, which Morgon was trying to reach when he disappeared. Along the way, she is assisted by Lyra, the Morgul of Herun's heir, and by Morgon's sister. The first half of the book describes their journey north. Along the way, Raederle grows to understand her own significant powers as a descendant of both shapechangers and witches. Her hidden ancestry makes her related to Morgon's enemies. Midway through the story, Reaerle discovers that Morgon is alive, while shapechangers and Ghisteslwchlohm, an ancient and traitorous wizard, pursue him. Sensing a powerful force pursuing her, Raederle uses her abilities to confound it, thinking she is protecting Morgon; but discovers that the force she thought was Ghisteslwchlohm is Morgon himself, who had stolen much of Ghisteslwchlohm's power during his long captivity, while the helpless man he pursued was Deth, who had betrayed him. Confronted with this, and realizing how he appears, Morgon forsakes his revenge and allows Deth to escape.

NACA ACR No. 5120, An Experimental Investigation of NACA Submerged- Duct Entrances. NACA, November 13, 1945. Abstract, Full report. also sometimes called a NACA scoop or NACA inlet, is a common form of low-drag air inlet design, originally developed by the U.S. National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the precursor to NASA, in 1945. Design Prior submerged inlet experiments showed poor pressure recovery due to the slow- moving boundary layer entering the inlet. This design is believed to work because the combination of the gentle ramp angle and the curvature profile of the walls creates counter-rotating vortices which deflect the boundary layer away from the inlet and draws in the faster moving air, while avoiding the form drag and flow separation that can occur with protruding scoop designs. Aircraft applications Three intakes on an engine cowling When properly implemented, a NACA duct allows air to flow into an internal duct, often for cooling purposes, with a minimal disturbance to the flow. The design was originally called a submerged inlet, since it consists of a shallow ramp with curved walls recessed into the exposed surface of a streamlined body, such as an aircraft. This type of flush inlet generally cannot achieve the larger ram pressures and flow volumes of an external design, and so is rarely used for the jet engine intake application for which it was originally designed, such as the North American YF-93 and Short SB.4 Sherpa. It is, however, common for piston engine and ventilation intakes. Automobile applications Ducts on the Ferrari F40 It is especially favored in racing car design. (Practical guidance on designing and building NACA ducts for motor-racing applications) Sports cars featuring prominent NACA ducts include the Ferrari F40, the Lamborghini Countach, the 1996-2002 Dodge Viper, the 1971-1973 Ford Mustang, the 1973 Pontiac GTO, the Porsche 911 GT2, the 1979 Porsche 924 Turbo, and the Nissan S130.

It has a total length of more than consisting of a central assembly building and two wings (eastern and western) housing government departments and a library. The name in German and Romansh both mean \\"federal house\\", whereas the French and Italian names both translate to \\"Federal Palace\\". The Latin word curia originates from Ancient Rome and originally meant an assembly, and later used for where the Roman Senate met, both meanings being relevant to the Federal Palace. History The building was designed by the architect Hans Wilhelm Auer and constructed between 1894 and 1902 by 173 Swiss firms and 33 Swiss artists. Its inauguration took place on 1 April 1902. The total cost, at the time, was 7,198,000 Swiss Francs. Domed Hall The central assembly building is dominated by a domed hall in the layout of a Swiss cross. It separates the two chambers of the National Council (south) and the Council of States (north). The dome itself has an external height of that was exceptional at the time, but chosen to balance the total length of the three buildings. The mosaic in the center represents the federal coat of arms along with the Latin motto Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno (One for all, and all for one), surrounded by the coat of arms of the 22 cantons that existed in 1902. The coat of arms of the Canton of Jura, created in 1979, was later placed outside of the mosaic. The hall is dominated by the sculpture The Three Confederates (Die drei Eidgenossen) created by James Andr√© Vibert and referring to the legendary oath to fight for Switzerland (R√ºtlischwur). North Fa√ßade North Fa√ßade The central entry facing the Federal Square (Bundesplatz) and opening up to a domed hall carries the inscription Curia Conf≈ìderationis Helvetic√¶ (Swiss Federal Assembly) underneath a pediment. The roof edge is topped by Auguste de Niederh√§usern-Rodo's allegorical sculpture of Helvetia representing independence (center), with the executive on her left, and the legislature on her right. This arrangement was inspired by the Pallas Athena Fountain of the Austrian Parliament. The pediment is flanked by two griffins by Anselmo Laurenti symbolizing courage, wisdom, and strength. The female allegories in the second floor niches by James Andr√© Vibert represent freedom (left) and peace (right). Two commemorative plaques above refer to the years 1291 (Federal Charter and the legendary R√ºtlischwur) and 1848 (first Federal Constitution transforms Switzerland into a federal state).

Life Duisberg was born in Barmen, Germany. From 1879 to 1882, he studied at the Georg August University of G√∂ttingen and Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, receiving his doctorate. After military service in Munich, which he combined with research in the laboratory of Adolf von Baeyer, he was hired in 1883 at the Farbenwerke (dye company) of Friedr. Bayer & Co., which later became Bayer AG. In his career, he became confidential clerk (authorised signatory) and head of research. In 1900, he became the CEO of Bayer. Inspired by Standard Oil on a US tour, Bayer became part of IG Farben, a conglomerate of German chemical industries. Duisberg was head of the supervisory board for IG Farben. He died in Leverkusen.

Farben AG, Carl Bosch and Carl Duisberg (in front sitting), Edmund ter Meer (third person from right with newspaper) During World War I, the German army faced a great threat from an ammunition shortage. Indeed, the nitrates that were crucial for the production of gunpowder could not be imported any more because of the blockade by the British Navy. As a result, the German chemical firms (BASF and Bayer among others) were pushed to successfully synthesise nitrates. However, because of the war, shortage in manpower arose, and Duisberg advised Max Bauer on a new solution. In November 1916, Duisberg advised the Kaiser's troops to begin deporting 60 000 people from occupied Belgium; they were put in trains for transport to German mines and factories. Complaints from influential neutral countries, especially the United States, put an end to it. Also, in 1916, General Wilhelm Groener was appointed by General Ludendorff to reduce inflation. He proposed that increases in costs could be absorbed by the chemical community. When Duisberg heard the proposition, he successfully influenced the German government for Groener's removal. In the 1920s, the dye industry leaders, led by Carl Duisberg of Bayer and Carl Bosch of BASF, successfully pushed for the merger of the dye makers into a single company. In 1925, the companies merged into the Interessengemeinschaft Farbenindustrie AG or IG Farben. The huge corporation, which soon included related industries such as explosives and fibers, was the biggest enterprise in all of Europe and the fourth largest in the world, behind General Motors, United States Steel and Standard Oil of New Jersey. Duisberg forced the use of chemical weapons during World War I.Kordula K√ºhlem (Hrsg): Carl Duisberg (1861-1935): Briefe eines Industriellen. Band 68 von Deutsche Geschichtsquellen des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts, Oldenbourg Verlag, 2012, One of Duisberg's major achievements was to move Bayer into pharmaceuticals. He supported Gerhard Domagk's eventually successful efforts to discover the first broadly effective antibiotic, Prontisil. Carl Duisberg Society The Carl Duisberg Society (Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft) was founded in 1949 and was helping development aid with education programmes for people, especially from developing countries. From 1949 until its merger with the German Society for international Development (Deutschen Stiftung f√ºr internationale Entwicklung) in 2002 to form the InWEnt (Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung gGmbH) 300000 people took part in the programs of the society.

Career  = Minor Leagues = Mike Jacobs graduated from Hilltop High School in Chula Vista and spent one season at Grossmont College in El Cajon, California before being selected by the New York Mets in the 38th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball Draft. Originally signed as a catcher, Jacobs batted .333 with four home runs and 30 runs batted in his first professional season with the Gulf Coast League Mets. He quickly blossomed into a solid power-hitting prospect and, in , after a successful year with the Double-A Binghamton Mets, won an award. In May , while playing for the Triple-A Norfolk Tides, Jacobs suffered an arm injury and underwent surgery for a torn labrum, which ended his season prematurely. Because of his injury and mediocre defensive skills behind the plate, when Jacobs returned to Binghamton in , he spent much of the season learning to play first base. He batted .321 with 25 home runs and 93 RBIs while learning his new position and going on to win the MVP award. On December 18, 2010, Jacobs was signed by the Colorado Rockies and played for the affiliate triple-A team in Colorado Springs, Colorado. While there, Jacobs was suspended for fifty games after testing positive for HGH. Jacobs was released from the Colorado Rockies on August 18, 2011. = New York Mets = Jacobs made his major league debut with the Mets on August 21, , hitting a three-run pinch-hit home run against Esteban Loaiza of the Washington Nationals in his first ever Major League at-bat. Jacobs rather instantly assumed the position of everyday first baseman and continued to hit, tallying four home runs through three games, during the Mets' 4-game drubbing of the Arizona Diamondbacks. During this stretch the Mets were able to pull within a half- game of the National League Wild Card lead, but faded quickly, dropping two straight games at home to the Philadelphia Phillies and promptly fading out of the race.

In 2006 with the Marlins, Jacobs played in 136 games while hitting .262 with 20 HR and 77 RBIs. In 2007, he only played in 114 games, but still improved on his batting average hitting .265 that season including 17 HR and 54 RBIs. In 2008 Jacobs saw increased playing time and had a break out season in power with 32 HR and 93 RBI but his batting average slipped to .247. = Kansas City Royals = After the season, Jacobs was traded to the Kansas City Royals for pitcher Leo N√∫√±ez.KC acquires power-hitting Jacobs While initially thought to split time at first base with Billy Butler, he was mostly the team's DH due to inconsistent play on the field.

He held a BS degree in Accounting from Roosevelt University, 1967. Air America Radio Drobny began to pursue the start of a liberal radio network sometime in late 2002 or early 2003. He and his wife, Anita, sold the forerunner of Air America Radio to a group headed by Evan Montvel Cohen. Drobny and his wife, Anita, had conceived the idea of starting a progressive talk radio network to compete with conservative talk radio. Drobny credits President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in helping Air America Radio get started. Drobny claims Gore introduced him to Al Franken, helping AAR secure Franken as talent. In mid-2003, the Drobnys met Cohen through a meeting arranged by David Goodfriend, a former Clinton aide and Beloit College classmate of Cohen.

It is used mainly by young Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians, Singaporeans and South Africans of British descent coming to the UK to work and as a base to explore Europe.  Requirements  The main requirements are: :* to have a grandparent born in the United Kingdom, Channel Islands or Isle of Man at any time; or a grandparent born in what is now the Republic of Ireland on or before March 31, 1922. :* to be a citizen of a Commonwealth country (it does not matter how citizenship was acquired), applying from outside the UK. Zimbabwe remains a Commonwealth country for immigration purposes. :* to be aged 17 or over :* ability, and intention, to undertake employment :* ability to support oneself (and one's dependents) in the United Kingdom without recourse to public funds. As a result of the Immigration Act 2014, the applicant may also be required to pay a healthcare surcharge as part of the process.  Terms of visa  The visa is granted for five years in the 'limited leave to enter' category. After this, the holder can apply for an extension (limited leave to remain) or for indefinite leave to remain (ILR). For ILR, the holder must show that he or she has been living continuously in the UK and is currently in continuing employment or has worked throughout the five years. The Home Office's guidance makes clear that if the applicant is working at the time of the ILR application, the applicant needs to show only that his or her current employment will continue. If not working at the time of the ILR application, the applicant will need to show that he or she has been continually working or looking for work throughout the five-year period. This visa does not prevent the holder from undertaking study; however, to stay within the terms of the status the holder should also be working.  British citizenship  After acquiring indefinite leave to remain, it is possible to apply for British citizenship by naturalisation after meeting normal residence requirements. See British nationality law. * The increase in the period of time under UK ancestry to five years before ILR can be applied for effectively means that applicants (who are usually not married to British citizens) must wait six years for British citizenship. This is because naturalisation as a British citizen for a person not married to a British citizen requires that ILR or its equivalent be held for twelve months. * Children born in the United Kingdom to persons with UK ancestry (since 1983) are not British citizens by birth. However, the child can be registered a British citizen once the parent obtains ILR if the child is still under 18 (it is not necessary to wait for the parent to become British).  Irish-born grandparent  A grandparent born in Northern Ireland at any time, or what is now the Republic of Ireland prior to 1 April 1922, gives rise to an entitlement to a right to admission under UK ancestry. However, there may also be an entitlement to register as an Irish citizen by descent which grants de facto permanent residency in the UK immediately. This may be possible as an alternative to, or in addition to, a UK Ancestry visa.  2008 abolition proposal  On 26 October 2005, The Times published an article outlining possible plans by the British Home Office to abolish admission under UK ancestry in favour of a points-based migration system. The issue had apparently been raised in the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. The possibility of abolition alarmed many people with British-born grandparents living in Commonwealth countries. Scotland's First Minister, Jack McConnell, expressed his concern over the possible abolition of the UK Ancestry visa. Mr. McConnell had recently been in Canada to encourage Canadians of Scottish heritage to move to Scotland. Canada has over four million citizens that are of Scottish descent. Part of the reason for this campaign was the concern over declining population and birth-rate in Scotland. His campaign received a great deal of interest in Canada. In March 2006, the announcement of a new points-based system made it clear that the ancestry route to the UK was outside its scope. The abolition of this route was once again brought up by the Home Office in February 2008 in a green paper. After receiving substantial feedback during consultation, the proposal was revised in July 2008 to preserve the clearance, but to provide that people taking that route to go through a probationary citizenship stage before applying for British citizenship or permanent residence.

Today, the Southern Tutchone language is more often being called, \\"D√§n'ke\\" which means 'our way' or, \\"D√§n k'e kw√§nje\\" which means 'our way of speaking' in the Athabaskan language. This territory stretches over the south-west Yukon, and is controversial in what is overlap with different indigenous groups of people in Yukon. The Tutchone language was separated into two groups by McClellan in which she called them Southern and Northern Tutchone. The languages themselves are close, but are different in subtle dialects.  Demographics  In the early 1950s there were close to 20,000 Southern Tutchone speaking individuals.McClellan, C. (1987). Yukon Indian languages. Chapter 6. In Part of the land, part of the water: A history of the Yukon Indians. (pp. 105-115). Vancouver/Toronto: Douglas & McIntyre. This has since plummeted to less than a few hundred speakers. As of 2004 the number of individuals who spoke Southern Tutchone as their first language was 404, and the total number of individuals who had some knowledge of the language was 645.  Revitalization efforts  The Southern Tutchone language is an endangered language with fewer than 100 speakers. There have been revitalization efforts in place to help combat the dwindling numbers. This includes signage throughout the Yukon highlighting the language. Other revitalization efforts includes an adult immersion program focused on increasing the number of speakers in the Champagne and Aishihik traditional territory. In 2015 the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations launched the first Da Ku N√§n Ts'tth√®t (Our House is Waking Up the Land) dance festival which focused on Southern Tutchone language and culture. This was hosted at the cultural centre named Da Ku, meaning \\"our house\\" in Southern Tutchone. Efforts for revitalization have also included school programs throughout the territory, as well as a language nest in Haines Junction, Yukon. The Yukon Native Language Centre has played a key role in many revitalization efforts as they have developed Indigenous teacher education programs, as well as curriculum materials.  Landclaims  In other places in the Southern Tutchone region there are four First Nations governments that have settled their land claims in the Southern Tutchone cultural area these include: *Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (Haines Junction) *Ta'an Kwach'an Councill (Lake Laberge) *Kluane First Nation (Burwash Landing) *Kwanlin D√ºn First Nations (Whitehorse)  See also  * Jim Boss  References  Sources *MacClellan, C.

Typical applications include image processing, analyzing 3D surfaces, solving partial differential equations, reducing non- visual problems to geometric maps, modelling biological vision and other sensory-motor organs. CNN architecture Due to their number and variety of architectures, it is difficult to give a precise definition for a CNN processor. From an architecture standpoint, CNN processors are a system of finite, fixed-number, fixed-location, fixed-topology, locally interconnected, multiple-input, single-output, nonlinear processing units. The nonlinear processing units are often referred to as neurons or cells. Mathematically, each cell can be modeled as a dissipative, nonlinear dynamical system where information is encoded via its initial state, inputs and variables used to define its behavior. Dynamics are usually continuous, as in the case of Continuous-Time CNN (CT-CNN) processors, but can be discrete, as in the case of Discrete-Time CNN (DT-CNN) processors. Each cell has one output, by which it communicates its state with both other cells and external devices. Output is typically real-valued, but can be complex or even quaternion, i.e. a Multi- Valued CNN (MV-CNN). n most CNN processors, processing units are identical, but there are applications that require non-identical units, which are called Non-Uniform Processor CNN (NUP-CNN) processors, and consist of different types of cells. In the original Chua-Yang CNN (CY-CNN) processor, the state of the cell was a weighted sum of the inputs and the output was a piecewise linear function. However, like the original perceptron-based neural networks, the functions it could perform were limited: specifically, it was incapable of modeling non-linear functions, such as XOR. More complex functions are realizable via Non-Linear CNN (NL-CNN) processors. Cells are defined in a normed space, commonly a two-dimensional Euclidean geometry, like a grid. The cells are not limited to two-dimensional spaces however; they can be defined in an arbitrary number of dimensions and can be square, triangle, hexagonal, or any other spatially invariant arrangement. Topologically, cells can be arranged on an infinite plane or on a toroidal space. Cell interconnect is local, meaning that all connections between cells are within a specified radius (with distance measured topologically). Connections can also be time- delayed to allow for processing in the temporal domain. Most CNN architectures have cells with the same relative interconnects, but there are applications that require a spatially variant topology, i.e. Multiple-Neighborhood-Size CNN (MNS-CNN) processors. Also, Multiple-Layer CNN (ML-CNN) processors, where all cells on the same layer are identical, can be used to extend the capability of CNN processors. The definition of a system is a collection of independent, interacting entities forming an integrated whole, whose behavior is distinct and qualitatively greater than its entities. Although connections are local, information exchange can happen globally through diffusion. In this sense, CNN processors are systems because their dynamics are derived from the interaction between the processing units and not within processing units. As a result, they exhibit emergent and collective behavior. Mathematically, the relationship between a cell and its neighbors, located within an area of influence, can be defined by a coupling law, and this is what primarily determines the behavior of the processor. When the coupling laws are modeled by fuzzy logic, it is a fuzzy CNN . When these laws are modeled by computational verb logic, it becomes a computational verb CNN (verb CNN) . Both fuzzy and verb CNNs are useful for modelling social networks when the local couplings are achieved by linguistic terms. Literature review The idea of CNN processors was introduced by Leon Chua and Lin Yang‚Äôs two-part, 1988 article, \\"Cellular Neural Networks: Theory\\" and \\"Cellular Neural Networks: Applications\\" in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems. In these articles, Chua and Yang outline the underlying mathematics behind CNN processors. They use this mathematical model to demonstrate, for a specific CNN implementation, that if the inputs are static, the processing units will converge, and can be used to perform useful calculations. They then suggest one of the first applications of CNN processors: image processing and pattern recognition (which is still the largest application to date). Leon Chua is still active in CNN research and publishes many of his articles in the International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, of which he is an editor. Both IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems and the International Journal of Bifurcation also contain a variety of useful articles on CNN processors authored by other knowledgeable researchers. The former tends to focus on new CNN architectures and the latter more on the dynamical aspects of CNN processors. Another key article, Tamas Roska and Leon Chua‚Äôs 1993 article \\"The CNN Universal Machine: An Analogic Array Computer\\", introduced the first algorithmically programmable analog CNN processor to the engineering research community. The multi-national effort was funded by the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and researched by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the University of California. This article proved that CNN processors were producible and provided researchers a physical platform to test their CNN theories. After this article, companies started to invest into larger, more capable processors, based on the same basic architecture as the CNN Universal Processor. Tamas Roska is another key contributor to CNNs. His name is often associated with biologically inspired information processing platforms and algorithms, and he has published numerous key articles and has been involved with companies and research institutions developing CNN technology. There are several overviews of CNN processors in published literature. One of the better references is a paper, \\"Cellular Neural Networks: A Review\\" written for Neural Nets WIRN Vietri 1993, by Valerio Cimagalli and Marco Balsi. The paper provides definitions, CNN types, dynamics, implementations, and applications in a relatively small, readable document. There is also a book, \\"Cellular Neural Networks and Visual Computing Foundations and Applications\\", written by Leon Chua and Tamas Roska, which provides examples and exercises to help illustrates points in a manner uncommon for papers and journal articles. The book covers many different aspects of CNN processors and can serve as a textbook for a Masters or Ph.D. course. The two references are considered invaluable since they manage to organize the vast amount of CNN literature into a coherent framework. The best place for CNN literature is from the proceedings of \\"The International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications\\". The proceedings are available online, via IEEE Xplore, for conferences held in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2006. There is also a workshop being held on July 14‚Äì16 in Santiago de Composetela, Spain. Topics include theory, design, applications, algorithms, physical implementations and programming/training methods. For an understanding of the analog semiconductor based CNN technology, AnaLogic Computers has their product line, in addition to the published articles available on their homepage and their publication list. They also have information on other CNN technologies such as optical computing. Many of the commonly used functions have already been implemented using CNN processors. A good reference point for some of these can be found in image processing libraries for CNN based visual computers such as Analogic‚Äôs CNN-based systems. Related processing architectures CNN processors could be thought of as a hybrid between ANN and CA (Continuous Automata). The processing units of CNN and NN are similar. In both cases, the processor units are multi-input, dynamical systems, and the behavior of the overall systems is driven primarily through the weights of the processing unit‚Äôs linear interconnect. The main discriminator is that in CNN processors, connections are made locally, whereas in ANN, connections are global. For example, neurons in one layer are fully connected to another layer in a feed-forward NN and all the neurons are fully interconnected in Hopfield networks. In ANNs, the weights of interconnections contain information on the processing system‚Äôs previous state or feedback, but in CNN processors, the weights are used to determine the dynamics of the system. Furthermore, due to the high inter-connectivity of ANNs, they tend not exploit locality in either the data set or the processing and as a result, they usually are highly redundant systems that allow for robust, fault- tolerant behavior without catastrophic errors. A cross between an ANN and a CNN processor is a Ratio Memory CNN (RMCNN). In RMCNN processors, the cell interconnect is local and topologically invariant, but the weights are used to store previous states and not to control dynamics. The weights of the cells are modified during some learning state creating long-term memory. The topology and dynamics of CNN processors closely resembles that of CA. Like most CNN processors, CA consists of a fixed-number of identical processors that are spatially discrete and topologically uniform. The difference is that most CNN processors are continuous-valued whereas CA have discrete-values. Furthermore, the CNN processor's cell behavior is defined via some non-linear function whereas CA processor cells are defined by some state machine. However, there are some exceptions. Continuous Valued Cellular Automata or Continuous Automata are CA with continuous resolution. Depending on how a given Continuous Automata is specified, it can also be a CNN. There are also Continuous Spatial Automata, which consist of an infinite number of spatially continuous, continuous-valued automata. There is considerable work being performed in this field since continuous spaces are easier to mathematically model than discrete spaces, thus allowing a more quantitative approach as opposed to an empirical approach taken by some researchers of cellular automata. Continuous Spatial Automata processors can be physically realized though an unconventional information processing platform such as a chemical computer. Furthermore, it is conceivable that large CNN processors (in terms of the resolution of the input and output) can be modeled as a Continuous Spatial Automata. Model of computation The dynamical behaviors of CNN processors can be expressed mathematically as a series of ordinary differential equations, where each equation represents the state of an individual processing unit. The behavior of the entire CNN processor is defined by its initial conditions, the inputs, the cell interconnect (topology and weights), and the cells themselves. One possible use of CNN processors is to generate and respond to signals of specific dynamical properties. For example, CNN processors have been used to generate multi-scroll chaos, synchronize with chaotic systems, and exhibit multi-level hysteresis. CNN processors are designed specifically to solve local, low-level, processor intensive problems expressed as a function of space and time. For example, CNN processors can be used to implement high-pass and low-pass filters and morphological operators. They can also be used to approximate a wide range of Partial differential equations (PDE) such as heat dissipation and wave propagation. CNN processors can be used as Reaction-Diffusion (RD) processors. RD processors are spatially invariant, topologically invariant, analog, parallel processors characterized by reactions, where two agents can combine to create a third agent, and diffusion, the spreading of agents. RD processors are typically implemented through chemicals in a Petri dish (processor), light (input), and a camera (output) however RD processors can also be implemented through a multi-layer CNN processor. D processors can be used to create Voronoi diagrams and perform skeletonisation. The main difference between the chemical implementation and the CNN implementation is that CNN implementations are considerably faster than their chemical counterparts and chemical processors are spatially continuous whereas the CNN processors are spatially discrete. The most researched RD processor, Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) processors, has already been simulated using a four-layer CNN processors and has been implemented in a semiconductor. Like CA, computations can be performed through the generation and propagation of signals that either grow or change over time. Computations can occur within a signal or can occur through the interaction between signals. One type of processing, which uses signals and is gaining momentum is wave processing, which involves the generation, expanding, and eventual collision of waves. Wave processing can be used to measure distances and find optimal paths. Computations can also occur through particles, gliders, solutions, and filterons localized structures that maintain their shape and velocity. Given how these structures interact/collide with each other and with static signals, they can be used to store information as states and implement different Boolean functions. Computations can also occur between complex, potentially growing or evolving localized behavior through worms, ladders, and pixel-snakes. In addition to storing states and performing Boolean functions, these structures can interact, create, and destroy static structures. Although CNN processors are primarily intended for analog calculations, certain types of CNN processors can implement any Boolean function, allowing simulating CA. Since some CA are Universal Turing machines (UTM), capable of simulating any algorithm can be performed on processors based on the von Neumann architecture, that makes this type of CNN processors, universal CNN, a UTM. One CNN architecture consists of an additional layer, similar to the ANN solution to the problem stated by Marvin Minsky years ago. CNN processors have resulted in the simplest realization of Conway‚Äôs Game of Life and Wolfram‚Äôs Rule 110, the simplest known universal Turing Machine. This unique, dynamical representation of an old systems, allows researchers to apply techniques and hardware developed for CNN to better understand important CA. Furthermore, the continuous state space of CNN processors, with slight modifications that have no equivalent in Cellular Automata, creates emergent behavior never seen before. Any information processing platform that allows the construction of arbitrary Boolean functions is called universal, and as result, this class CNN processors are commonly referred to as universal CNN processors. The original CNN processors can only perform linearly separable Boolean functions. This is essentially the same problem Marvin Minsky introduced with respect to the perceptions of the first neural networks In either case, by translating functions from digital logic or look-up table domains into the CNN domain, some functions can be considerably simplified. For example, the nine-bit, odd parity generation logic, which is typically implemented by eight nested exclusive-or gates, can also be represented by a sum function and four nested absolute value functions. Not only is there a reduction in the function complexity, but the CNN implementation parameters can be represented in the continuous, real-number domain. There are two methods by which to select a CNN processor along with a template or weights. The first is by synthesis, which involves determine the coefficients offline. This can be done by leveraging off previous work, i.e. libraries, papers, and articles, or by mathematically deriving co that best suits the problem. The other is through training the processor. Researchers have used back- propagation and genetic algorithms to learn and perform functions. Back- propagation algorithms tend to be faster, but genetic algorithms are useful because they provide a mechanism to find a solution in a discontinuous, noisy search space. Technology An information processing platform remains nothing more than an intellectual exercise unless it can be implemented in hardware and integrated into a system. Although processors based on billiard balls can be interesting, unless their implementation provides advantages for a system, the only purpose they serve is as a teaching device. CNN processors have been implemented using current technology and there are plans to implement CNN processors into future technologies. They include the necessary interfaces for programming and interfacing, and have been implemented in a variety of systems. What follows is a cursory examination of the different types of CNN processors available today, their advantages and disadvantages, and the future roadmap for CNN processors. CNN processors have been implemented and are currently available as semiconductors and there are plans to migrate CNN processors to emerging technologies in the future. Semiconductor-based CNN processors can be segmented into analog CNN processors, digital CNN processors, and CNN processors emulated using digital processors. Analog CNN processors were the first to be developed. Analog computers were fairly common during the 1950 and 1960s, but they gradually were replaced by digital computers the 1970s. Analog processors were considerably faster in certain applications such as optimizing differential equations and modeling nonlinearities, but the reason why analog computing lost favor was the lack of precision and the difficulty to configure an analog computer to solve a complex equation. Analog CNN processors share some of the same advantages as their predecessors, specifically speed. The first analog CNN processors were able to perform real-time ultra-high frame-rate (>10,000 frame/s) processing unachievable by digital processors. The analog implementation of CNN processors requires less area and consumes less power than their digital counterparts. Although the accuracy of analog CNN processors does not compare to their digital counterparts, for many applications, noise and process variances are small enough not to perceptually affect the image quality. The first algorithmically programmable, analog CNN processor was created in 1993. It was named the CNN Universal Processor because its internal controller allowed multiple templates to be performed on the same data set, thus simulating multiple layers and allowing for universal computation. Included in the design was a single layer 8x8 CCN, interfaces, analog memory, switching logic, and software. The processor was developed in order to determine CNN processor producibility and utility. The CNN concept proved promising and by 2000, there were at least six organizations designing algorithmically programmable, analog CNN processors. This is when AnaFocus, a mixed-signal semiconductor company that emerged from research at The University of Seville, introduced their ACE prototype CNN processor product line. Their first ACE processor contained 20x20 B/W processor units; their next ACE processor provided 48x48 grayscale processor units, and their latest ACE processor contains 128x128 grayscale processor units. Over time, not only did the number of processing elements increase, but their speed improved, the number of functions they can perform increased, and a seamless detector interface was integrated into the silicon (yielding considerably improved interface). The ability to embed the detector interface into the CNN processor allows for real-time interaction between the sensing and processing. AnaFocus has a multilayer CASE prototype CNN processors line. The latest CASE processor is a three layer 32x32 CNN processor. Their work in CNN processors is currently culminating in their soon-to-be-released, commercially available Eye-RIS product line that consists of all the processors, co-processors, software development kits, and support needed to program and integrate an analog processor into a system. AnaFocus is working with AnaLogic Computers, to include their CNN processors into visual systems. Founded in 2000, by many of the same researchers behind the first algorithmically programmable CNN Universal Processor, AnaLogic Computers mission is to commercialize high- speed, biologically inspired systems based on CNN processors. In 2003, AnaLogic Computers developed a PCI-X visual processor board that included the ACE 4K processor, with a Texas Instrument DIP module and a high-speed frame- grabber. This allowed CNN processing to be easily included in a desktop computer, considerably improving the usability and capability of CNN analog processors. In 2006, AnaLogic Computers developed their Bi-I Ultra High Speed Smart Camera product line, which includes the ACE 4K processor in their high- end models. The product that their development team is now pursuing is the Bionic Eyeglass. The Bionic Eyeglass is a dual-camera, wearable platform, based on the Bi-I Ultra High Speed Smart Camera, designed to provide assistance to blind people. Some of the functions that the Bionic Eyeglass system will perform is route number recognition and color processing. Some researchers are developed their own custom analog CNN processors. For example, an analog CNN processor was developed from a research team from University degli Studi di Catania, in order to generate gaits for a hexapod robot. Researchers from National Chiao Tung University designed a RM-CNN processor to learn more about pattern learning & recognition and researchers from the National Lien-Ho Institute of Technology developed a Min-Max CNN (MMCNN) processor to learn more about CNN dynamics. Given the diversity of CNN processors and the momentum that CNN research has gained, it is plausible that such analog CNN development efforts will be fairly common in the near future. Despite their speed and low power consumption, there are some significant drawbacks to analog CNN processors. First, analog CNN processors can potentially create erroneous results due to environment and process variation. In most applications, these errors are not noticeable, but there are situations where minor deviations can result in catastrophic system failures. For example, in chaotic communication, process variation will change the trajectory of a given system in phase space, resulting in a loss of synchronicity/stability. Due to the severity of the problem, there is considerable research being performed to ameliorate the problem. Some researchers are optimizing templates to accommodate greater variation. Other researchers are improving the semiconductor process to more closely match theoretical CNN performance. Other researchers are investigating different, potentially more robust CNN architectures. Lastly, researchers are developing methods to tune templates to target a specific chip and operating conditions. In other words, the templates are being optimized to match the information processing platform. Not only does process variation limit what can be done with current analog CNN processors, it is also a barrier for creating more complex processing units. Unless this process variation is resolved, ideas such as nested processing units, non-linear inputs, etc. cannot be implemented in a real-time analog CNN processor. Also, the semiconductor \\"real estate\\" for processing units limits the size of CNN processors. Currently the largest AnaVision CNN-based vision processor consists of a 4K detector, which is significantly less than the megapixel detectors found in affordable, consumer cameras. Unfortunately, feature size reductions, as predicted by Moore‚Äôs Law, will only result in minor improvements. For this reason, alternate technologies such as Resonant Tunneling Diodes and Neuron-Bipolar Junction Transistors are being explored. Also, the architecture of CNN processors is being reevaluated. For example, Star-CNN processors, where one analog multiplier is time-shared between multiple processor units, have been proposed and are expected to result in processor unit reduction size of eighty percent. Although not nearly as fast and energy efficient, digital CNN processors do not share the problems of process variation and feature size of their analog counterparts. This allows digital CNN processors to include nested processor units, non-linearities, etc. In addition, digital CNN are more flexible, cost less and are easier to integrate. The most common implementation of digital CNN processors uses an FPGA. Eutecus, founded in 2002 and operating in Berkeley, provides intellectual property that can be synthesized into an Altera FPGA. Their digital 320x280, FPGA-based CNN processors run at 30 frame/s and there are plans to make a fast digital ASIC. Eustecus is a strategic partner of AnaLogic computers, and their FPGA designs can be found in several of AnaLogic‚Äôs products. Eutecus is also developing software libraries to perform tasks including but not limited to video analytics for the video security market, feature classification, multi-target tracking, signal and image processing and flow processing. Many of these routines are derived using CNN-like processing. For those wanting to perform CNN simulations for prototyping, low-speed applications, or research, there are several options. First, there are precise CNN emulation software packages like SCNN 2000. If the speed is prohibitive, there are mathematical techniques, such as Jacobi‚Äôs Iterative Method or Forward-Backward Recursions that can be used to derive the steady state solution of a CNN processor. Said techniques can be performed by any mathematics tool, e.g. Matlab. Lastly, digital CNN processors can be emulated on highly parallel, application-specific processors, such as graphics processors. Implementing neural networks using graphics processors is an area of exploration for the research community. Researchers are also perusing alternate technologies for CNN processors. Although current CNN processors circumvent some of the problems associated with their digital counterparts, they do share some of the same long-term problems common to all semiconductor-based processors. These include, but are not limited to, speed, reliability, power-consumption, etc. AnaLogic Computers, is developing optical CNN processors, which combine optics, lasers, and biological and holographic memories. What initially was technology exploration resulted in a 500x500 CNN processor able to perform 300 giga- operations per second. Another promising technology for CNN processors is nanotechnology. One nanotechnology concept being investigated is using single electron tunneling junctions, which can be made into single-electron or high- current transistors, to create McCulloch-Pitts CNN processing units. In summary, CNN processors have been implemented and provide value to their users. They have been able to effectively leverage the advantages and address some of the disadvantages associated with their underling technology, i.e. semiconductors. Researchers are also transitioning CNN processors into emerging technologies. Therefore, if the CNN architecture is suited for a specific information processing system, there are processors available for purchase (as there will be for the foreseeable future). Applications The philosophy, interests, and methodologies of CNN researchers are varied. Due to the potential of the CNN architecture, this platform has attracted people from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines. Some are exploring practical implementations of CNN processors, others are using CNN processors to model physical phenomena, and there are even researchers exploring theoretical mathematical, computational, and philosophical ideas through CNN processors. Some applications are engineering related, where some known, understood behavior of CNN processors is exploited to perform a specific task, and some are scientific, where CNN processors are used to explore new and different phenomenon. CNN processors are versatile platforms that are being used for a variety of applications. CNN processors were designed to perform image processing; specifically, the original application of CNN processors was to perform real-time ultra-high frame-rate (>10,000 frame/s) processing unachievable by digital processors needed for applications like particle detection in jet engine fluids and spark-plug detection. Currently, CNN processors can achieve up to 50,000 frames per second, and for certain applications such as missile tracking, flash detection, and spark-plug diagnostics these microprocessors have outperformed a conventional supercomputer. CNN processors lend themselves to local, low-level, processor intensive operations and have been used in feature extraction, level and gain adjustments, color constancy detection, contrast enhancement, deconvolution, image compression, motion estimation, image encoding, image decoding, image segmentation, orientation preference maps, pattern learning/recognition, multi-target tracking, image stabilization, resolution enhancement, image deformations and mapping, image inpainting, optical flow, contouring, moving object detection, axis of symmetry detection, and image fusion. Due to their processing capabilities and flexibility, CNN processors have been used & prototyped for novel field applications such as flame analysis for monitoring combustion at a waste incinerator, mine-detection using infrared imagery, calorimeter cluster peak for high energy physics, anomaly detection in potential field maps for geophysics, laser dot detection, metal inspection for detecting manufacturing defects, and seismic horizon picking. They have also been used to perform biometric functions such as fingerprint recognition, vein feature extraction, face tracking, and generating visual stimuli via emergent patterns to gauge perceptual resonances. CNN processors have been used for medical and biological research in performing automated nucleated cell counting for detecting hyperplasia, segment images into anatomically and pathologically meaningful regions, measure and quantify cardiac function, measure the timing of neurons, and detect brain abnormalities that would lead to seizures. One potential future application of CNN microprocessors is to combine them with DNA microarrays to allow for a near-real time DNA analysis of hundreds of thousands of different DNA sequences. Currently, the major bottleneck of DNA microarray analysis is the amount of time needed to process data in the form of images, and using a CNN microprocessor, researchers have reduced the amount of time needed to perform this calculation to 7ms. CNN processors have also been used to generate and analyze patterns and textures. One motivation was to use CNN processors to understand pattern generation in natural systems. They were used to generate Turing patterns in order to understand the situations in which they form, the different types of patterns which can emerge, and the presence of defects or asymmetries. Also, CNN processors were used to approximate pattern generation systems that create stationary fronts, spatio-temporal patterns oscillating in time, hysteresis, memory, and heterogeneity. Furthermore, pattern generation was used to aid high-performance image generation and compression via real-time generation of stochastic and coarse-grained biological patterns, texture boundary detection, and pattern and texture recognition and classification. Control and Actuator Systems There is an ongoing effort to incorporate CNN processors into sensory-computing-actuating machines as part of the emerging field of Cellular Machines. The basic premise is to create an integrated system that uses CNN processors for the sensory signal-processing and potentially the decision- making and control. The reason is that CNN processors can provide a low power, small size, and eventually low-cost computing and actuating system suited for Cellular Machines. These Cellular Machines will eventually create a Sensor- Actuator Network (SAN), a type of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) which can be used for military intelligence gathering, surveillance of inhospitable environments, maintenance of large areas, planetary exploration, etc. CNN processors have been proven versatile enough for some control functions. They have been used to optimize function via a genetic algorithm, to measure distances, to perform optimal path-finding in a complex, dynamic environment, and theoretically can be used to learn and associate complex stimuli. They have also been used to create antonymous gaits and low-level motors for robotic nematodes, spiders, and lamprey gaits using a Central Pattern Generator (CPG). They were able to function using only feedback from the environment, allowing for a robust, flexible, biologically inspired robot motor system. CNN-based systems were able to operate in different environments and still function if some of the processing units are disabled. The variety of dynamical behavior seen in CNN processors make them intriguing for communication systems. Chaotic communications using CNN processors is being researched due to their potential low power consumption, robustness and spread spectrum features. The premise behind chaotic communication is to use a chaotic signal for the carrier wave and to use chaotic phase synchronization to reconstruct the original message. CNN processors can be used on both the transmitter and receiver end to encode and decode a given message. They can also be used for data encryption and decryption, source authentication through watermarking, detecting of complex patterns in spectrogram images (sound processing), and transient spectral signals detection. CNN processors are neuromorphic processors, meaning that they emulate certain aspects of biological neural networks. The original CNN processors were based on mammalian retinas, which consist of a layer of photodetectors connected to several layers of locally coupled neurons. This makes CNN processors part of an interdisciplinary research area whose goal is to design systems that leverage knowledge and ideas from neuroscience and contribute back via real- world validation of theories. CNN processors have implemented a real-time system that replicates mammalian retinas, validating that the original CNN architecture chosen modeled the correct aspects of the biological neural networks used to perform the task in mammalian life. However, CNN processors are not limited to verifying biological neural networks associated with vision processing; they have been used to simulate dynamic activity seen in mammalian neural networks found in the olfactory bulb and locust antennal lobe, responsible for pre-processing sensory information to detect differences in repeating patterns. CNN processors are being used to understand systems that can be modeled using simple, coupled units, such as living cells, biological networks, physiological systems, and ecosystems. The CNN architecture captures some of the dynamics often seen in nature and is simple enough to analyze and conduct experiments. They are also being used for stochastic simulation techniques, which allow scientists to explore spin problems, population dynamics, lattice-based gas models, percolation, and other phenomena. Other simulation applications include heat transfer, mechanical vibrating systems, protein production, Josephson Transmission Line (JTL) problems, seismic wave propagation, and geothermal structures. Instances of 3D (Three Dimensional) CNN have been used to prove known complex shapes are emergent phenomena in complex systems, establishing a link between art, dynamical systems and VLSI technology. CNN processors have been used to research a variety of mathematical concepts, such as researching non-equilibrium systems, constructing non-linear systems of arbitrary complexity using a collection of simple, well-understood dynamic systems, studying emergent chaotic dynamics, generating chaotic signals, and in general discovering new dynamic behavior. They are often used in researching systemics, a trandisiplinary, scientific field that studies natural systems. The goal of systemics researchers is to develop a conceptual and mathematical framework necessary to analyze, model, and understand systems, including, but not limited to, atomic, mechanical, molecular, chemical, biological, ecological, social and economic systems. Topics explored are emergence, collective behavior, local activity and its impact on global behavior, and quantifying the complexity of an approximately spatial and topologically invariant system . Although another measure of complexity may not arouse enthusiasm (Seth Lloyd, a professor from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has identified 32 different definitions of complexity), it can potentially be mathematically advantageous when analyzing systems such as economic and social systems.

Tabu received a 2000 Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actress for this movie. Suhasini Mulay won National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1999 for this movie. Synopsis The story opens with the kidnapping of Panna Barve (Tabu), the daughter of Chief Minister Malti Barve (Suhasini Mulay). The responsible gang's demand is that one of their members be released from police custody. While in captivity, Panna reminisces about her childhood, where she had to struggle to grow up with a power hungry and inconsiderate mother and a simple, quiet, and spineless father (Shivaji Satam). Panna's mother had also been carrying on a rather open affair with party co-member Sawantrao Gadre (Mohan Agashe). Flashback over and Panna soon meets the man behind her kidnapping Aditya (Sunil Shetty) who Panna knows from before. Via second flashback, we learn that Panna and \\"Adi\\" were lovers once upon a time. Their closeness stemmed from the fact that he also was struggling with a corrupt parent in the form of businessman father, P.N. Patel (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). Panna and Adi both find solace in a poor basti with the company of Adi's old teacher Joshi Master and in the philosophy of poet Bhau (Nana Patekar), much to the dismay of the couple's respective parents. Bhau even goes to the extent of becoming Malti's most vociferous opponent. Due to a sudden car accident, however, Adi is presumed dead and Panna loses Adi's out-of-wedlock baby before it can be born. Thus ends the second flashback. Getting back to the kidnapping, Adi and Panna reunite after quite some time. They talk to each other and piece together the events that have occurred since their separation. Just then, the missing gang member is sent back to Adi. It is none other than Bhau, who is returned to the gang with his brain destroyed by electric shock. News also comes that Joshi Master is killed in jail and it is portrayed as a suicide. Panna and Adi then decide what the best form of poetic justice will be for their parents. They both sneak into an election campaign of Malti Bave and P.N. Patel, and explode bombs attached to them, thus destroying everything. The film ends with Panna 's father working as headmaster in a school. Gulzar suggests that although we have already ruined the world for Generation X, we should focus our efforts into the protection and education of our school children. If we shield them from this corruption, they will become the leaders of tomorrow, and they will run the country the way it should be.

He was a backup infielder for most of his Major League Baseball (MLB) career. He, along with Darryl Strawberry, and Ricky Led√©e are the only Major League Baseball players to have played for all four (former and current) New York teams‚Äîthe New York Yankees, the New York Mets, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the San Francisco Giants. With the Yankees, he won the 2000 World Series against the Mets. Early career =Los Angeles Dodgers (1989‚Äì1990)= Vizca√≠no made his debut with the Dodgers as a late- season call-up in 1989, where he played five games at shortstop for them to conclude the season. In 1990, he was again called up late, playing in 37 games and where he hit a respectable .275. Despite his play, he was traded to the Chicago Cubs on December 14, 1990. =Chicago Cubs (1991‚Äì1993)= In Chicago, Vizca√≠no saw his playing time increase, appearing in no less than 86 games in any given season, including a career-high 151 games in 1992. In 1993, he played a significant role, having 551 at-bats and being 9th in the National League with 131 singles as well as second in the NL with 9 sacrifice flies. =New York Mets (1994‚Äì1996)= The Cubs traded Vizca√≠no to the New York Mets on March 30, 1994, for Anthony Young and minor-leaguer Ottis Smith.https://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-31/sports/sp-40471_1_anthony-young In 1994, Vizca√≠no, now a starter for the first time in his career, collected 105 hits before the strike shortened the season. When play resumed in 1995, Vizca√≠no responded with his best season to that point, collecting 146 hits, including a career-high 21 doubles and 56 runs batted in, although his strikeouts increased slightly to 76. He finished fifth in the National League in hits that year. In 1996, Vizca√≠no played in 96 games for the Mets, hitting .303 (a career-high) with 32 runs batted in. On July 29, 1996, Vizca√≠no was traded to the Cleveland Indians along with Jeff Kent for Carlos Baerga and Alvaro Espinoza. =Cleveland Indians (1996)= In Cleveland, Vizca√≠no appeared in 48 games to complete the 1996 season, and made his first career trip to the postseason. In the 1996 American League Division Series against the Baltimore Orioles, Vizca√≠no collected four hits (including two doubles) and one run batted in. Despite these contributions, the Indians were defeated by the Orioles. On November 13, 1996, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants along with Matt Williams and a player to be named later (Joe Roa) and Trent Hubbard along with Jeff Kent and Juli√°n Tav√°rez. =San Francisco Giants (1997)= With the Giants, he appeared in 151 games hitting .266 with a career-high 50 runs batted in, along with a career-high 87 strikeouts while again returning to the postseason and finished tenth in the National League in hits. In the postseason, Vizca√≠no collected two hits and one run while striking out five times as the Giants were defeated by the Florida Marlins. On October 29, 1997, he was granted free agency. =Return to the Dodgers (1998‚Äì2000)= On December 8, 1997, Vizca√≠no re-signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He appeared in a career-low 67 games in 1998 hitting .262 with 29 runs batted in. In 1999, Vizca√≠no played in 94 games collecting 29 runs batted in. Vizca√≠no began the 2000 season with the Dodgers, hitting a dismal .204 over 40 games (collecting only 19 hits). On June 20, he was traded to the New York Yankees with cash for Jim Leyritz. =New York Yankees (2000)= Vizca√≠no appeared in 73 games for the Yankees, hitting .276 with 10 runs batted in, earning a spot on the Yankees postseason roster. In the American League Division Series, he scored one run as a pinch-runner. In the American League Championship Series, he played in four games collecting two hits, three runs, and 2 runs batted in (along with two stolen bases) as the Yankees defeated the Seattle Mariners. Vizca√≠no played in four of the five games in the 2000 World Series against the New York Mets. He is most known for his dramatic hit on October 21, 2000, in Game 1. In the bottom of the 12th inning of the then longest game in World Series history, Vizca√≠no hit the game-winning RBI single. He earned a World Series ring when the Yankees defeated the Mets in five games. On November 1, he was granted free agency. =Houston Astros (2001‚Äì2005)= Vizca√≠no signed with the Astros on November 20. In 2001, he hit .277 with 71 hits and 14 runs batted in. He appeared in three games in the 2001 National League Division Series, he was 1 for 6 as Houston was defeated by the Atlanta Braves. In 2002, he hit .303 with five home runs and 37 runs batted in 125 games. In 2003, Vizca√≠no appeared in only 91 games, where he collected 26 runs batted in. In 2004, Vizca√≠no rebounded, hitting .274 and playing in 138 games at shortstop while Adam Everett was out with a broken wrist. In the 2005 National League Division Series, Vizca√≠no went 0-for-5 in two games. Despite his lack of productivity, the Astros defeated the Braves in 5 games. In the 2005 National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Vizca√≠no did not fare better, again going hitless. In the 2005 World Series, Vizca√≠no collected one hit, one walk, and two runs batted in. In Game 2 of the 2005 World Series, he came close to repeating his 2000 World Series walk-off moment when he hit a two-run single with two outs in the ninth inning to tie the game. Following his game tying hit for the Houston Astros, Vizca√≠no stayed in the game at shortstop for the bottom of the ninth, and on the way out to his position, he realized he had forgotten his cap and had to return to the dugout to get it. After the game Vizca√≠no commented \\"It was crazy, I ran out there without [a cap], and when I realized it, I felt funny. More camera time for me, I guess.\\" The Astros went on to lose when Scott Podsednik homered in the bottom of the inning and overshadowed Vizca√≠no's heroics. In Game 3 of that year's Series, Vizca√≠no played the entire game, which broke the record for the longest game in World Series history on October 25, 2005. =Return to the Giants (2006)= Vizca√≠no with the San Francisco Giants in 2006 Vizca√≠no was not offered arbitration following the 2005 season from Houston. Instead, he signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco Giants, who designated pitcher Brian Burres for assignment to make room for him on the roster. On August 14, Vizca√≠no was designated for assignment by the Giants after hitting just .210 over 64 games. =St. Louis Cardinals (2006)= On August 23, 2006, Vizca√≠no was signed to a contract by the Cardinals and spent the rest of the 2006 season as a replacement for injured shortstop David Eckstein. Post-playing career Vizca√≠no currently works in the front office of the Los Angeles Dodgers as a Special Assistant of Baseball Operations, a position he has held since the beginning of the 2008 season. Personal life Vizca√≠no's son, Jos√© Jr., played college baseball for Santa Clara University and was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 7th round of the 2015 MLB Draft.https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=vizcai002jos References External links Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Albuquerque Dukes players Category:Bakersfield Dodgers players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Gulf Coast Dodgers players Category:Houston Astros players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers scouts Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:New Orleans Zephyrs players Category:New York Mets players Category:New York Yankees players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:San Francisco Giants players ","title":"Jos√© Vizca√≠no"},{"id":"2506544","text":"Map of traditional territory of the Northern Tutchone The Northern Tutchone are a First Nations people of the Athabaskan-speaking ethnolinguistic group living mainly in the central Yukon in Canada.

He is best known for his role as the antagonist Shakaal in Shaan (1980),. Starting off with the Delhi-based theatre group 'Yatrik' in the 1960s, he moved to films with Sai Paranjpye's Jadu Ka Shankh in 1974. He worked in several parallel cinema films before working in the mainstream Hindi film industry. He appeared in Mahesh Bhatt's classic Arth (1982), Ek Chadar Maili Si (1986), Waaris (1988), and in all three parts of Deepa Mehta's Elements trilogy: Fire (1996), Earth (1998), and Water (2005). After nearly two decades he was seen on the theatre stage at the Padatik Theatre in Kolkata in the production of Atmakatha, directed by Vinay Sharma. Personal life Kharbanda is married to Maheshwari, a woman who was previously married to the Maharaja of Kotah. Born the daughter of Maharaja Ram Singh II of Pratapgarh, Rajasthan, Maheshwari married Kharbanda in 1965. Career After his studies he and a few of his college friends formed a theatre group called \\"Abhiyaan\\", and then joined Delhi-based \\"Yatrik\\", a bilingual theatre repertory founded by director Joy Michael in 1964; he became its first paid artiste, though after a few years Yatrik collapsed as the director was lecturing in US universities. That is when he moved to Kolkata in 1972 and started working with the theatre group \\"Padatik\\" which did Hindi theatre, under director Shyamanand Jalan. Here he worked for a while before moving on to Mumbai and films. He first got noticed in Nishaant (1974) by Shyam Benegal, with whom he went on to work in several more films including Manthan (1976), Bhumika: The Role (1977), Junoon (1978), and Kalyug (1980). Soon he was a regular with parallel cinema directors, like in Godhuli (1977) with B. V. Karanth. Playing the bald villain Shakaal in Shaan (1980) directed by Ramesh Sippy, he saw his transition into Bollywood mainstream. Kharbanda went on to appear in Shakti (1982), Ghayal (1990), Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (1992), Gupt (1997), Border (1997), Yes Boss (1997) and Refugee (2000). However, he continued appearing in art films such as Chakra (1981), with Smita Patil and Naseeruddin Shah, Arth (1982), with Shabana Azmi, Andhi Gali (1984), the first Hindi film of Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Ek Chadar Maili Si (1986), with Hema Malini, Utsav (1984), by Girish Karnad, Mandi (1983), Trikal (1985), Susman (1987), by Shyam Benegal, Naseem (1995), by Saeed Akhtar Mirza and Monsoon Wedding (2001) directed by Mira Nair. He portrayed Reema Lagoo's husband and Raj Babbar's brother in Shashi Kapoor's Filmwalas Productions' Kalyug. He has also appeared in period pieces such as Jodha Akbar and Lagaan. His most recent films are Aloo Chaat and Team: The Force. He has acted in a number of Punjabi films. He portrayed the hero in the legendary film Chan Pardesi (1980) and starred in the Punjabi comedy Mahaul Theek Hai (1999). He has acted in six of Deepa Mehta's movies and all her trilogy films: Earth, Fire and Water. He did a German film in 2009. He has acted in TV serials, such as Shanno Ki Shaadi and Mahi Ve. He has been seen on the stage in plays such as Teen Farishtay, Hatya ek akaar ki, Baki Itihaas, Ek Shunya Bajirao, Guinea Pig, Girdhade, Sakharam Binder and, recently, Atmakatha.

Nicknamed O Bruxo de Arteixo (\\"The Wizard of Arteixo\\"), Iglesias' professional career, which spanned more than four decades, was closely associated to Deportivo as both a player and manager. Playing career Born in Arteixo, Province of A Coru√±a, Iglesias started his career with local side Deportivo de La Coru√±a. He made his La Liga debut on 28 October 1951 in a 1‚Äì6 away loss against FC Barcelona, and scored the following weekend against RCD Espa√±ol (3‚Äì1 home win). Iglesias netted seven goals in three separate seasons for the Galicians, adding a career-best eight in 1956‚Äì57, which nonetheless ended in relegation. In six of the following eight years he also played in the top division, representing Sevilla FC, Granada CF and Real Oviedo; he amassed competition totals of 238 games and 50 goals, and retired at 35 after a spell in the lower leagues with Albacete Balompi√©. Coaching career Iglesias started coaching one year after retiring, his first appointment being at Deportivo's reserves, which he accumulated with assistant duties in the main squad. Midway through the 1970‚Äì71 campaign he was named the first team's manager, leading them to a top-flight promotion and being relegated in 1973. In 1973‚Äì74, Iglesias repeated the feat with another Segunda Divisi√≥n side, H√©rcules CF, then remained at the club's helm for a further three years, always managing to comfortably stay afloat ‚Äì this included a fifth place in 1975 and a sixth in 1976; in the 1977‚Äì78 season another promotion to the top level befell, this time as champions with Real Zaragoza. Iglesias worked in the top tier in two of the next three seasons, leading Burgos CF to the 13th position in 1978‚Äì79 and leaving AD Almer√≠a midway through the 1980‚Äì81 campaign, due to several internal disputes. In 1982 he returned to Deportivo, with the club in the second level. In 1987‚Äì88, Iglesias was one of three coaches as Depor nearly suffered relegation to Segunda Divisi√≥n B, being saved by a last-minute goal against Racing de Santander. He was again reinstated as first-team manager, finally attaining promotion to the first division in 1991 after ranking second. Iglesias replaced sacked Marco Antonio Boronat at the club's helm late in 1991‚Äì92, as Deportivo had to play a relegation playoff against Real Betis, eventually winning 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. In the following seasons, however, Super Depor came to fruition, with several team players winning individual accolades and being called to the Spain national team as the side finished three consecutive campaigns in the top three; during this timeframe, he was named Manager of the Year three times, twice by Don Bal√≥n and once by El Pa√≠s. Iglesias retired from football after 1994‚Äì95. Midway through the following campaign, however, he accepted an offer from Real Madrid to replace fired Jorge Valdano, with the Merengues finally ranking sixth and being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League by eventual winners Juventus FC. In 2005, Iglesias was appointed manager of the Galicia autonomous football team, working alongside Fernando V√°zquez. In the previous decade, he also worked as a sports commentator. In 2016, Iglesias was bestowed with the highest recognition of Deportivo, a special insignia, and was declared \\"Blue and White Legend\\". The event took place at halftime of the last game of the 2015‚Äì16 season, at the Estadio Riazor.

A descant is a form of medieval music in which one singer sang a fixed melody, and others accompanied with improvisations. The word in this sense comes from the term ' (descant \\"above the book\\"), and is a form of Gregorian chant in which only the melody is notated but an improvised polyphony is understood. The ' had specific rules governing the improvisation of the additional voices. Later on, the term came to mean the treble or soprano singer in any group of voices, or the higher pitched line in a song. Eventually, by the Renaissance, descant referred generally to counterpoint. Nowadays the counterpoint meaning is the most common. Descant can also refer to the highest pitched of a group of instruments, particularly the descant viol or recorder. Similarly, it can also be applied to the soprano clef. In modern usage, especially in the context of church music, descant can also refer to a high, florid melody sung by a few sopranos as a decoration for a hymn. In hymns Hymn tune descants are counter-melodies, generally at a higher pitch than the main melody. Although the English Hymnal of 1906 did not include descants, this influential hymnal, whose music editor was Ralph Vaughan Williams, served as a source of tunes for which the earliest known hymn tune descants were published. These were in collections compiled by Athelstan Riley, who wrote \\"The effect is thrilling; it gives the curious impression of an ethereal choir joining in the worship below; and those who hear it for the first time often turn and look up at the roof!\\". An example of a descant from this collection (for the British national anthem) goes as follows: << << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/2 \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"muted trumpet\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\\\relative c'' { g2 b e  d2. e4  fis2  g b, e  d2. fis,4 g2  c2 c4( b) a2  b1. d,2 g b  d2. a4 b2  e c a  a2. b4 d2  b d e  f2. e4 d2  c d4( e) fis2  g1. \\\\bar\\".\\" } } ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\relative c << { g2 g a  fis2. g4 a2  b b c  b2. a4 g2  a g fis  g1. d'2 d d  d2. c4 b2  c c c  c2. b4 a2  b c4 b a g  b2. c4 d2  \\\\tuplet 3/2 { e4 d c } b2 a  g1. } \\\\ { d2 e e  d2. e4 fis2  g g a  g2. fis4 e2  e d d  d1. b'2 g b  a1 g2  e a a  a2. g4 fis2  g fis4 g e e  g2. g4 g2  g g fis  d1. } >> } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\relative c' << { b2 b c  a2. d4 c2  d e e  d e4 c b2  c a a  b1. d2 d d  d1 d2  c2 e e  d1 d2  d c4 d c b  f'2. e4 d2  e d c  b1. } \\\\ { g2 e c  d c4 b a2  g e' a,  b c4 d e2  c d1  g1. g2 b g  fis e4 fis g2  a g fis  g fis4 g d2  g, a4 b c e  d e d c b2  c4 a b c d2  1\\\\. } >> } >> >> \\\\layout { indent = #0 } \\\\midi { \\\\tempo 2 = 80 } Among composers of descants during 1915 to 1934 were Alan Gray, Geoffrey Shaw, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Several of their descants appear in what is possibly the earliest hymnal to include descants, Songs of Praise (London: Oxford University Press, 1925, enlarged, 1931, reprinted 1971). During the last quarter of the twentieth century, new editions of hymnals increased the number of included descants. For example, the influential Hymnal 1940 (Episcopal) contains no descants, whereas its successor, The Hymnal 1982, contains 32. Among other currently used hymnals, The Worshiping Church contains 29 descants; The Presbyterian Hymnal, 19; The New Century Hymnal, 10; Chalice Hymnal, 21. The Vocal Descant Edition for Worship, Third Edition (GIA Publications, 1994) offers 254 descants by composers such as Hal Hopson, David Hurd, Robert Powell, Richard Proulx, and Carl Schalk. In the United Kingdom and elsewhere, the Carols for Choirs collection, which features descants by David Willcocks and others to well known Christmas tunes such as \\"O come, all ye faithful\\" has contributed to the enduring popularity of the genre.

The manga was serialized in the monthly manga magazine Dengeki Comic Gao! by MediaWorks from 1996 to 2001. The anime, produced by Bandai Visual and Studio Deen, aired between 2 April 1997 and 25 June 1997.  Themes  This series explores some themes of folk religion such as possession, exorcism, shamanism, yurei, and yokai. In the final episode, some more existential themes are explored.  Characters  =Main cast= ; * : The son of a Christian minister and president of Sait≈ç High School's Holy Student Council. He has curly blonde hair and as the series progresses, he grows it long and keeps it in a ponytail. Though he has no spiritual powers aside of seeing ghosts, Haruto is entrusted with the seven badges of the school spirits and summons them as necessary. He hates his job and dealing with ghosts, but his attempts to resign or transfer schools are constantly sabotaged by the Chairman. His dream is to spend one day attending classes, though his fellow student council members enjoy slacking off. With the exception of Episode 6, every episode ends with him saying \\"Oh my God!\\" : In the manga, while Haruto still thinks he doesn't really fit in the Council in his own words, he's noticeably more mature, reliable and level-headed than his anime incarnation, and gets along somewhat better with the spirits. ; * : The son (grandson in the manga) of a Buddhist monk. His body is seen as ideal for ghosts and he is constantly possessed by the ghosts of people, animals, and demons; his friend and fellow Council member Mutsuki has to exorcise him several times a day. He is incredibly amorous of females, particularly the Toilet Hanako of the school and all the other Toilet Hanakos. In the manga, this obsession is a family trait shared by his grandfather Taro Ryudo, owner of the shrine where Kazumi lives. ; * : The tomboyish, strongwilled daughter of the proprietors of a Shinto shrine, and a miko (shrine priestess) in her own right. Redhaired, pretty, and rather curvy, she is a master of exorcism. She has an aggressive shotacon tendence, an attraction to young boys, and Nino is often a target of this. Unusually enough for an anime series, while Mutsuki is not the main character or the de facto leader of the Holy Student Council, she is the strongest of the primary human characters and often acts like more like a leader than Haruto himself. She can use her prayer stick as a weapon, and frequently expels spirits out of Kazumi using her \\"Asahina Special\\" exorcism attack. Shingo Oumi (Manga-Only) : Shingo makes his first appearance in Volume 2 of the manga series during the introduction of the Blue Hanten, but he soon becomes a recurring main character as of Volume 3. Shingo is a much more easy- going, laid back, fellow of the group that usually lightens the mood with a more friendly style of teasing. While he does attend a different High School, he has become good friends with Haruto and the other members of the Holy student council through an adventure dealing with his younger brother and a Teke Teke imposter. As such, he is often found helping out and tagging along on all of the adventures and mysteries that follow soon after. Shingo uses Tarot cards to predict the future and uses a large knowledge of folklore and other background information to help the others. =School spirits= ; * : A boy spirit found in a statue of Ninomiya Sontoku (a common statue seen at many Japanese schools). He is very intelligent and he (for example) takes rule books as comedy books. Mutsuki adores him and he is the frequent target of her shotacon antics. His badge color is yellow. ; * : A male spirit who wears a red cape and a white eye mask. His charms are said to be irresistible to women, though he has no power over Asahina because she prefers younger boys. His visual similarities to Sailor Moon's Tuxedo Kamen is made more explicit in an episode mid-way through the series when he is enlisted to distract a trio of ghosts calling themselves the Sailors XO and is even briefly depicted wearing a top hat, which he complains about. He also has a sister named Blue Hanten. He wears a mask over his eyes because his beauty is so overwhelming that everyone regardless of gender or preference falls in love with him, causing headaches and fevers as the effects wear off. His badge color is red. ; * : A male giant spirit, seen almost exclusively from the knees down. He is known as the \\"Dancing Giant\\" and is the \\"master\\" of the school's gym. He wears olive trousers and brown dress shoes. His badge color is purple. ; and * Voiced by: Hisayoshi Izaki (Suzuki) and Yutaka Shimaka (Haruo) : These two spirits show up as a team, since they are the bones and the internal organs of an anatomical model of a human being. They are generally completely incompetent and make the situations they are summoned to help far worse. Their badge color is dark green, though in Episode 5, the duo state that the badge color is iridescent and can be seen as any color. ; * : A girl spirit of the mirror. She appears very rarely in the series, but is the quietest and most normal of the ghosts. Her badge color is orange. In the manga she has several mirror-related powers, using them to teleport people through different ones and showing others what's reflected in different glasses. ; * : A scantily- clad teenaged female spirit who dwells in a disused men's toilet in the high school. Toilet Hanako is one of the most popular school spirits having been voted No. 1 for 562 weeks on the spirit world's \\"School Spirits' Top Ten\\" voting program. Kazumi is obsessed with her. She once was the golden student of the school, not only beautiful but very athletic, smart and charismatic. Her badge color is pink. ; * : The chairman of the school, named Sait≈ç Tatsugoro, is also a spirit, who can be summoned along with the others. He instructs the three members of the Holy Student Council to gather the badges for him, thus starting the series. He collects haunted artifacts from all over the world, thus continually increasing the number of ghosts that inhabit the halls. His badge color is dark blue. (Manga-only) : He's the ghost who takes care of the music room; he's a living portrait of Ludwig van Beethoven who weeps tears of blood. He seems to have a good share of knowledge about ghosts themselves, though not rivaling the Chairman's. In the manga, he's the one who has the dark green badge and not Suzuki and Sato.

In origin, it is a style of organum that either includes a plainchant tenor part (usually on a melisma in the chant) or is used without a plainchant basis in conductus, in either case with a \\"note against note\\" upper voice, moving in contrary motion. It is not a musical form, but rather a technique. The term continued to be used down to modern times with changing senses, at first for polyphony in general, then to differentiate a subcategory of polyphony (either in contrast to organum, or for improvised as distinct from written polyphony). By extension it became the name of a part that is added above the tenor, and later as the name of the highest part in a polyphonic setting (the equivalent of \\"cantus\\", \\"superius\\", and \\"soprano\\"). Finally, it was adopted as the name of the highest register of instruments such as recorders, cornets, viols, and organ stops.Rudolf Flotzinger, \\"Discant [descant, descaunt(e), deschant, deschaunt(e), dyscant; verb: discanten]\\", ¬ßI.

English Discant\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). Because English discant technique has commonly been associated with such a succession of first- inversion triads, it has inevitably become confused with fauxbourdon, with which it has \\"no connection whatsoever\\".Sylvia W. Kenney, \\"'English Discant' and Discant in England\\", Musical Quarterly 45, no. 1 (January 1959): pp. 26‚Äì48. Citation on pp. 26 and 41. This misinterpretation was first brought forward in 1936 by Manfred F. Bukofzer,Geschichte des englischen Diskants und des Fauxbourdons nach den theoretischen Quellen, mit zahlreichen Notenbeispielen (Strasbourg: Heitz); Reprint edition, in Sammlung musikwissenschaftlicher Abhandlungen 21 (Baden-Baden: V.

Jahrhunderts, Schriftenreihe des Musikwissenschaftliches Seminars der Universit√§t M√ºnchen 3 (Munich: Musikwissenschaftliches Seminar der Universit√§t M√ºnchen). and then by Sylvia Kenney\\"'English Discant' and Discant in England\\", Musical Quarterly 45, no. 1 (January 1959): pp. 26‚Äì48. and Ernest H. Sanders.\\"Cantilena and Discant in 14th-Century England\\". Musica Disciplina, 19 (1965):7‚Äì52. A second hypothesis, that an unwritten tradition of this kind of parallel discant existed in England before 1500, \\"is supported neither by factual evidence nor by probability\\". Characteristics This style was dominant in early 12th century Aquitanian polyphony, and can be identified by the following characteristics: # Both the tenor and upper parts move at about the same rate, using the equalitas punctorum (an approximately equal rate of movement in all the voices) with between one and three notes in the upper part to every note in the tenor part. At the end of a phrase however, in discant style, the upper part may have more notes, thus producing a more melismatic passage at a cadence. # Throughout the discant passages, the two parts interchange between consonant intervals: octaves, fifths. # Discant style is characterised by the use of rhythmic modes throughout each part. In earlier types of organum, rhythm was either not notated as in organum purum, or notated in only the upper voice part, however Notre Dame composers devised a way of notating rhythm using ligatures and six different types of rhythmic modes. Examples of this can be found in some of L√©onin‚Äôs late 12th-century settings. These settings are often punctuated with passages in discant style, where both the tenor and upper voice move in modal rhythms, often the tenor part in mode 5 (two long notes) and the upper part in mode 1 (a long then short note). Therefore it is easier to imagine how discant style would have sounded, and we can make a guess as to how to recreate the settings. It is suggested by scholars such as Grout, that L√©onin used this non-melismatic style in order to mirror the grandeur of Notre Dame Cathedral itself. Current research suggests that the word 'discantus' was formed with the intention of providing a separate term for a newly developed type of polyphony. If true, then it is ironic that the newer term, \\"discantus\\", ended up being applied to the older note-against-note style, while the older word \\"organum\\" was transferred to the more innovative style of florid-against-sustained-note polyphony. This may have been partly because the 12th century was an era that believed in progress, so that the more familiar \\"organum\\" was kept for the style then considered to be the most up-to-date.Rudolf Flotzinger, \\"Organum, ¬ß6: ‚ÄòOrganum‚Äô and ‚ÄòDiscant‚Äô: New Terminology\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). Discant in three or four voices The development of modal rhythms enabled the progression from two part discant style to three and four part discant style. This is because, only voices, confined to a set rhythm can be combined effectively to make a set phrase. This was mainly related to P√©rotin, around 1200. The parts in these three and four past settings were not necessarily related to each other. Evidence suggests that the parts were either related to the tenor part, or composed independently. Either way, this formed the first ‚Äòcomposition‚Äô, and provided a foundation for development, and a new style, conductus was developed from the three and four part discant ideas.

Glisson in command. Service history After charter, Mount Vernon convoyed two steamers and two sailing ships to the Gulf of Mexico in May. While in the gulf, she took brigantine East, suspected of communicating with Confederate- held shore territory, and towed damaged Parkersburg from Pensacola, Florida to Key West. Ordered to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, 3 July, Mount Vernon gave refuge to Unionists preparing to travel north. From 17 July, Mount Vernon patrolled in and off the Rappahannock River, capturing sloop Wild Pigeon in an attempted escape at night 20 July. On 1 September she sailed for Mobjack Bay to relieve , and in November proceeded to Beaufort, North Carolina. She engaged British schooner Phantom off Cape Lookout 2 December, and on the 31st sent an armed party to aid in firing a ship being used by the Confederates as a beacon. In continued blockade and patrol service off North Carolina, Mount Vernon took British schooners British Queen on 1 March 1862 and Mary Jane on 24 March 1863. With and , Mount Vernon chased Confederate schooner Kate ashore near Fort Casswell 2 April, and later in the month captured St. George. After joining in the attack on Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point 2 May, Mount Vernon returned to blockade duty, playing a key role in the Navy's efforts to block the flow of materials from overseas and from one point to another in the Confederacy. She took Constitution 23 May, forced an unknown schooner to ground and set herself on fire 26 June, then in July took up close blockade of New Inlet and Little River Inlet. With Cambridge, in December Mount Vernon chased another schooner ashore, a feat duplicated on 12 June 1863. Mount Vernon, , and together cut out a blockade runner on 1 August near New Inlet. Arriving Newport News, Virginia early in 1864, Mount Vernon remained there until May 1864. She was in the group of Union ships attacked by North Carolina off the mouth of Cape Fear River in May, and she searched for Florida in July. She joined in the abortive attack on Fort Fisher 23 and 24 December, and renewed the attack in mid-January 1865.

It is usually made from two or more large sticks attached by a short chain; one stick is held and swung, causing the other (the swipple) to strike a pile of grain, loosening the husks. The precise dimensions and shape of flails were determined by generations of farmers to suit the particular grain they were harvesting. For example, flails used by farmers in Quebec to process wheat were generally made from two pieces of wood, the handle being about long by in diameter, and the second stick being about long by about in diameter, with a slight taper towards the end. Flails for other grains, such as rice or spelt, would have had different dimensions. French peasants threshing with flails around 1270. Flails have generally fallen into disuse in many nations because of the availability of technologies such as combine harvesters that require much less manual labour. But in many places, such as Minnesota, wild rice can only be harvested legally using manual means, specifically through the use of a canoe and a flail that is made of smooth, round wood no more than 30 inches long.  Non-agricultural uses  As with most agricultural tools, flails were often used as weapons by farmers who may have lacked better weapons. The flail is proposed as one of the origins of the two-piece baton known in the Okinawan kobud≈ç weapon system as the nunchaku. The first recorded use of a flail as a weapon was at the siege of Damietta in 1218 during the 5th crusade, as depicted in the chronicle by Matthew Paris ; tradition has it the man was the Frisian Hayo of Wolvega who bashed the standard bearer of the muslim defenders with it and captured the flag. Flails were also used as weapons by farmers under the leadership of Jan ≈Ωi≈æka during the Hussite Wars in Bohemia. In ancient Egypt the flail was a symbol associated with the monarch, symbolizing his ability to provide for the people (see Crook and flail).http://www.penn.museum/documents/education/pennmuseum_egypt_previsit_combined.pdf See also * Gohei * ≈ånusa References  External links   Antique Farm Tools * Agriculture in Victorian Times * Picture of one kind of rice flail Category:Egyptian artefact types Category:Threshing tools Category:Mechanical hand tools ","title":"Flail"},{"id":"2506593","text":"Adam Fox (1883‚Äì1977), Canon, was the Dean of Divinity at Magdalen College, Oxford.

Chandler is also known as a chess writer and occasional organiser of chess tournaments. He is also the only NZ chess grandmaster. Career Murray Chandler, Rio 1979 Chandler won the New Zealand chess championship in 1975‚Äì76, and qualified as an International Master in 1977 by winning the first Asian Junior Chess Championship in Baguio. His first international chess appearance was in 1974 when he turned out for the New Zealand team in the first Asian Team Chess Championship in Penang, Malaysia. Later, he represented New Zealand at the Chess Olympiads of 1976, 1978 and 1980 but then switched allegiance to England. He played for England at the Chess Olympiads of 1982, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990 and 1992, as part of a highly successful team that defeated the Soviets in some crucial encounters. He maintained an Elo rating around the 2600 level between 1987 and 1992, and qualified for the grandmaster title in 1983. Amongst Chandler's best results have been Commonwealth Champion (twice ‚Äì jointly in 1984 and outright in 1987British Chess Magazine, October 1987, page 448), first place at Brighton 1981, first place in the Blackpool Zonal of 1990, tie for first place, Lloyds Bank Masters 1979, tie for first place, Hastings Premier 1986/7, and tied for second place (behind Anatoly Karpov), London 1984. He also played for the Rest of World team versus the Soviet Union in 1984 and tied first at the British Chess Championship of 1986, but lost the play-off match for the title.

One win was in the World Under-16 Championship in 1976, and the other in a simultaneous display in 1985. Chandler was editor of British Chess Magazine from 1991 to 1999. In the late 1990s he also set up Gambit Publications, a publisher of high quality chess books that has received good reviews from all quarters. Fellow Gambit directors were England teammate John Nunn and FIDE Master-cum-author, Graham Burgess. The company now has a large back-catalogue containing contributions from all three directors and from a host of other respected chess writers. Books like Modern Chess Strategy by John L. Watson have been highly acclaimed and Chandler's own How To Beat Your Dad At Chess is a very large seller. He also produced VHS and DVD material for Bad Bishop Ltd., a company related to Gambit, including a repertoire against the Nc6 Sicilian, based on the early Bb5 lines. He returned to New Zealand in 2006, winning his second New Zealand Chess Championship that year and a third champion's title in 2008. He has now reverted his player registration to the New Zealand Federation, making him eligible once more to play for his country of birth. In 2013, he purchased the old Saint Paul's church in Auckland, converting it into a chess coaching centre.Simon Maude, Grandmaster opens chess centre, North Shore Times, 15 April, 2014 Chandler in 2018, after his investiture as a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit by the governor-general, Dame Patsy ReddyIn the 2017 New Year Honours Chandler was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to chess.

This species can grow to a length of up to and a weight of , although there are unconfirmed reports of individuals up to and , perhaps caused by confusion with the mangar (Luciobarbus esocinus). The shabout supports important fisheries, but has declined because of habitat loss (mostly due to dams, water extraction, drought and pollution) and overfishing. Habitat and behavior The shabout inhabits rivers from upstream tributaries to river mouths. However, it is rather adaptable and can also be found in more stagnant waters like marshes and reservoirs, although this strong swimmer prefers slow to moderately flowing waters and it has relatively high oxygen requirements. Adults prefer relatively cool waters (optimum ), and migrate upstream in the summer when the lower reaches of rivers become warm, but smaller individuals stay in the lower parts year-round. Nevertheless, the species has a wide temperature tolerance with wild individuals living in rivers that range at least from , and individuals kept in aquaculture at between . This is a freshwater fish, but it does tolerate slightly brackish waters in estuaries; however, their growth significantly decreases under such conditions. Shabout breed in the spring and summer. They breed in upstream parts of rivers, generally in places with relatively cool and fast-flowing waters, a depth of no more than and a gravel bottom. A female reaches maturity when at least three years old and can lay up to 235,764 eggs, placed among gravel or plants. The species is mostly herbivorous, feeding on a wide range of plant material from algae and macrophytes to fruits and grain. They also feed at lower levels on invertebrates and small fish, with one study suggesting that individuals become more predatory as they reach a large size. Fishing It is a commercially fished species. The shabout has recently been in the news when it was proposed that this \\"shabut\\" was identical to the fish called in the Talmud shibuta (◊©◊ô◊ë◊ï◊ò◊ê). The latter's brain is famous for being touted as the kosher equivalent, taste-wise, of the otherwise forbidden and even taboo pork meat (cf. Chullin 109b). However, names of species are notorious for changing over time and between related languages, a fact, incidentally, the Talmud itself attests. The fact that Arabibarbus grypus is called in Modern Hebrew Shibuta is no proof that it is the same fish as the Talmudic one, as Modern Hebrew has a strong tendency to assimilate local Arabic names for such realia. The shabout is an important target species for commercial fisheries which has been heavily overfished in some parts of its range for many years. In addition, it dams have blocked its migration routes and its habitat has been further degraded by water abstraction and pollution. In Iraq the population had declined by 90% between the 1960s and the 2000s, although data from other parts of its range is not available. The fish is also being considered for aquaculture. Many species of carp are farmed as a protein source already.

They were written by Sir Dystic of CULT OF THE DEAD COW (cDc) and released March 21, 2001 at the @lantacon convention in Atlanta, Georgia. More than seven years after its release, Microsoft released a patch that fixed the hole exploited by SMBRelay.\\"Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-068.\\" Microsoft Security Bulletin, November 11, 2008.

This fix only fixes the vulnerability when the SMB is reflected back to the client. If it is forwarded to another host, the vulnerability can be still exploited.\\".\\" NTLM is Dead - 20 DefCon\\".\\" Security Bugs in Protocols are Really Bad!  SMBRelay  SMBrelay receives a connection on UDP port 139 and relays the packets between the client and server of the connecting Windows machine to the originating computer's port 139. It modifies these packets when necessary. After connecting and authenticating, the target's client is disconnected and SMBRelay binds to port 139 on a new IP address. This relay address can then be connected to directly using \\"net use \\\\192.1.1.1\\" and then used by all of the networking functions built into Windows. The program relays all of the SMB traffic, excluding negotiation and authentication. As long as the target host remains connected, the user can disconnect from and reconnect to this virtual IP. SMBRelay collects the NTLM password hashes and writes them to hashes.txt in a format usable by L0phtCrack for cracking at a later time. As port 139 is a privileged port and requires administrator access for use, SMBRelay must run as an administrator access account. However, since port 139 is needed for NetBIOS sessions, it is difficult to block. According to Sir Dystic, \\"The problem is that from a marketing standpoint, Microsoft wants their products to have as much backward compatibility as possible; but by continuing to use protocols that have known issues, they continue to leave their customers at risk to exploitation... These are, yet again, known issues that have existed since day one of this protocol. This is not a bug but a fundamental design flaw. To assume that nobody has used this method to exploit people is silly; it took me less than two weeks to write SMBRelay.\\" Greene, Thomas C. \\"Exploit devastates WinNT/2K security.\\" The Register online edition, April 19, 2001. Retrieved August 20, 2005.  SMBRelay2  SMBRelay2 works at the NetBIOS level across any protocol to which NetBIOS is bound (such as NBF or NBT). It differs from SMBrelay in that it uses NetBIOS names rather than IP addresses. SMBRelay2 also supports man-in-the-middling to a third host. However, it only supports listening on one name at a time.

It was published by Konami in Japan in March 1981, and manufactured and distributed by Stern in North America on June 22, 1981. It is the prequel to 1981's Scramble arcade game. The game was a commercial success, selling 12,337 arcade cabinets in the United States in four months, by October 2, 1981, becoming Stern's third best- selling arcade classic after Berzerk and Scramble. Scramble sold 15,136 cabinets in the U.S. in five months earlier that year, adding up to 27,473 U.S. cabinet sales for both. Super Cobra was widely ported by Parker Brothers, and there are Adventure Vision and standalone versions from Entex. Gameplay The player controls a helicopter through tight caverns, and the slightest misstep will result in the loss of a life. However, unlike Scramble, the game can be continued where the player left off by adding more credits (machine may usually offer this option; some others don't, but player loses all points upon continuing). The joystick accelerates, decelerates, moves up, and moves down. The helicopter uses a laser and bomb to destroy defenders, tanks, and UFOs while infiltrating 10 Super Cobra defense systems. The ship has a limited fuel supply, which is depleted over time. More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game. The game is divided into ten sections, plus a finale, each with a different style of terrain and different obstacles. Players navigate through ten levels and a base, where they must safely make it through the level and remove the booty. The levels are described as follows, # Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets. # Chopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain. # Smart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire. # Single Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear, but do not fire. # Chopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against falling mines. # Rapidly firing, roving tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire. # Maneuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or 3 times with laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of chopper which explodes when hit five times with laser. Rockets appear but do not fire. # Chopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFOs. Tanks and rockets appear, but do not fire. # Chopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings. # Firing rockets in a building maze. # Base: Player must maneuver the chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away. If the mission is successful, an extra copter is given (plus one when 10,000 points are scored). There is no intermission between each section; the game simply scrolls into the new terrain. If the player destroys the booty on the final level, they must start back at the beginning of the level. If the booty is safely carried away, the player starts back at the beginning of the first level and the cycle repeats. On the second time through the levels, the tanks fire much more aggressively and fuel is consumed much faster. On the third and subsequent times through the levels, fuel is consumed still faster. The faster rate of fuel consumption on the second and subsequent cycles may make it difficult to complete those cycles without losing at least one chopper due to running out of fuel, although this is compensated somewhat by awarding an extra chopper each time a cycle is completed and the booty is carried away. Ports The game was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Intellivision, Odyssey¬≤, and Atari 8-bit family by Parker Brothers. It was released also for Sord M5, MSX, Entex Adventure Vision and Casio PV-1000. Entex also made a standalone tabletop version of the game. Reception Arcade Express in November 1982 gave the Adventure Vision port a score of 9 out of 10. They concluded that it \\"takes real skill to master, and represents the state-of-the-art of scrolling shoot-outs\\". The Atari 2600 version was awarded a Certificate of Merit in the category of \\"Best Action Videogame\\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards for 1983. They compared it to Vanguard and said it \\"provides the same brand of relentless, multi-scenario action.\\" Legacy Super Cobra appeared alongside Scramble on the retro compilation Konami Arcade Classics, released for the Sony PlayStation in 1999.

He was closely associated with the avant-garde of his time and brought modernist aesthetics to bear on his theory of dance. Escudero was one of the few theorists of his time to comment on the choreography and presentation of the male flamenco dance and his 'Decalogue' or ten rules for the male dancer are still respected today. As well as being the leading flamenco dancer of his era, he was a talented painter in the style, and his studies of flamenco are frequently exhibited. His work was admired by the Spanish modernist painter Joan Mir√≥. Escudero also appeared in the films Castille On Fire (1960) and With the East Wind (1966). His first official performance was in 1920 at the Olympia Theatre in Paris. He reached his maturity as a dancer between 1926 and 1936, during which time he toured extensively in Europe and the Americas. His most famous production was El amor brujo Escudero's style brought a new dignity and respect to the male flamenco dance, which had sometimes (though wrongly) been regarded as exaggerated and lacking in artistry. Escudero's writing on the subject of flamenco dance and choreography was influential in forming the tastes of his own generation and the next, and he both worked with and influenced the legendary Antonio Gades. His style was based on a strong and expressive masculinity and clear and precise footwork and braceos (arm movements). Escudero's ten principles were as follows: # Dance in a masculine style. # Sobriety. # Turn the wrist with the fingers closed. # Limited movement of the hips. # Dance in a calm manner, without vanity. # Harmony of feet, arms and head. # Be beautiful, flexible and honest. # Develop an individual style and emphasis. # Dance in traditional costume. # Keep a range of sounds in the mind, don't put nails in the boots, dance on a simple stage and don't use accessories. His published writing includes: * Mi baile (My Dance) (1947); * Pintura que baila (A Dancing Painter) (1950); * Dec√°logo del buen bailar√≠n (Ten Rules for a Male Dancer)(1951).

The seller extends to the buyer a junior mortgage which wraps around and exists in addition to any superior mortgages already secured by the property. Under a wrap, a seller accepts a secured promissory note from the buyer for the amount due on the underlying mortgage plus an amount up to the remaining purchase money balance. The new purchaser makes monthly payments to the seller, who is then responsible for making the payments to the underlying mortgagee(s). Should the new purchaser default on those payments, the seller then has the right of foreclosure to recapture the subject property. Because wraps are a form of seller financing, they have the effect of lowering the barriers to ownership of real property; they also can expedite the process of purchasing a home. An example: :The seller, who has the original mortgage sells his home with the existing first mortgage in place and a second mortgage which he \\"carries back\\" from the buyer. The mortgage he takes from the buyer is for the amount of the first mortgage plus a negotiated amount less than or up to the sales price, minus any down payment and closing costs. The monthly payments are made by the buyer to the seller, who then continues to pay the first mortgage with the proceeds. When the buyer either sells or refinances the property, all mortgages are paid off in full, with the seller entitled to the difference in the payoff of the wrap and any underlying loan payoffs. Typically, the seller also charges a spread. For example, a seller may have a mortgage at 6% and sell the property at a rate of 8% on a wraparound mortgage. He then would be making a 2% spread on the payments each month (roughly). The difference in principal amounts and amortization schedules will affect the actual spread made). As title is actually transferred from seller to buyer, wraparound mortgage transactions may give the bank or other mortgagees the right to call the superior notes due, based on the due-on-sale clause of the underlying mortgage(s), if such a clause is present. It is appropriate to note that the bank or other mortgagees may elect to continue to receive interest payments even in the case where they become aware of the transfer of ownership. If the mortgage remains current (and especially if the new buyer brings a formerly-defaulted mortgage current again) the original lender has no real incentive to elect acceleration of the note since they remain in a secure position.

He is considered a leading authority in Haredi Jewish society.http://acheinu.co.il/?CategoryID=487&ArticleID;=6061http://artscroll.com/Books/9781422618684.htmlhttp://blog.aishhaolam.com/2016/11/recommendations- by-the-gadol-hador-rav-chaim-kanievsky-to-merit-children/  Biography  A visitor seeking Kanievsky's advice HaRav Chaim Kanievsky was born January 8, 1928, in Pinsk, Second Polish Republic, to Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, known as the \\"Steipler Gaon\\", and Rebbitzen Miriam Karelitz (Pesha Miriam: Pesha was added), sister of Rabbi Avraham Yeshayahu Karelitz, known as the \\"Chazon Ish\\". He married Batsheva Elyashiv, daughter of Rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv. In his youth he was known as a brilliant child prodigy who could remember torah with a photographic memory and could elucidate complicated rabbinic teachings despite his young age. During the Israeli War of Independence, Rabbi Kanievsky, then a student at the Lomza Yeshiva, was mobilized into the Israel Defense Forces. He was assigned to stand guard on a large hill near Jaffa. Kanievsky's wife died in 2011. Currently, he lives in Bnei Brak, and receives thousands of visits every year from Jews seeking religious and Halachik advice. He is the official rabbi and spiritual guide for the non-profit organization Belev Echad, which was founded in Israel on 2011 and is dedicated to assist sick and disabled children and adults. Since the passing of Rabbi Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman in December 2017, HaRav Kanievsky, along with Ponevezh Yeshiva head Rabbi Gershon Edelstein, is widely considered to be one of the leaders of the Israeli Haredi community.  Statements and rulings  In 2012, Kanievsky ruled that it is forbidden to possess or use a smartphone without individual permission from a halakhic authority, and that owners are not allowed to sell their phones, but should instead burn them. In 2015, he instructed United Hatzalah paramedics that in the event of a terrorist attack, they should not treat the terrorists before the victims, even if the terrorist is more seriously injured, and they may even leave the terrorist to die. In 2016, Kanievsky declared that medicinal cannabis was kosher for Passover as long the possession of the cannibis is not in violation of the law of the land. In 2017, Kanievsky ruled that reporting instances of sexual child abuse to the police is consistent with Jewish law. Kanievsky has made several statements that indicate he feels the coming of the Messiah is possibly imminent. In 2011, he interpreted Arab Spring uprisings as evidence that the Messiah might be near. In 2015, following the 2014 Jerusalem synagogue attack, he repeatedly referred to the imminent arrival of the Messiah and urged diaspora Jews to make aliyah (immigrate to Israel), reportedly resulting in the arrival of a substantial number of French Jews. In February 2020, shortly before the Israeli legislative elections, it was reported by one rabbi that Kanievsky had stated that the coming of the messiah was possibly imminent. =Covid-19= During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Kanievsky originally ordered his hundreds of thousands of followers to defy the Israeli Health Ministry's order to close all schools by keeping ultra- Orthodox schools open and claiming that the best ways to defeat the virus are to avoid lashon hara (gossiping about one's peers), strengthen humility and place the needs of others before their own. As a result of the ruling, he was visited on March 15 by senior police officials in an unsuccessful bid to convince him of the importance of following the orders of medical professionals with regards to the outbreak. On March 29, after the ultra- Orthodox community was hit hardest by the virus with Bnei Brak having the highest percentage of coronavirus cases in Israel relative to its population, Kanievsky ruled that one who does not follow the Israeli Health Ministry's guidelines on COVID-19 is in the position of one who pursues another with intent to murder.https://forward.com/yiddish/442711/world-renowned-rabbi- chaim-kanievsky-issues-rulings-about-coronavirus He also ruled that telephones may be answered on Shabbat to get COVID-19 test results, and that minyanim must not meet at all during the pandemic, a stricter requirement than the Health Ministry's rules which allow congregations to meet outdoors as long as participants are at least two meters (6 feet) distant from each other.https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-prominent-rabbi-orders-to- pray-alone-to-stem-coronavirus-spread-in-haredi-community-1.8722409  Published works  Kanievsky is the author of many works of Jewish law, such as Derech Emunoh (\\"The Path of Faith\\"), on agricultural laws, Derech Chochmoh (\\"The Path of Wisdom\\"), on the laws of the Jewish temple rites, and Shoneh Halachos (a systematic presentation of the popular work Mishnah Berurah).

It remains Nelson's most acclaimed album and features a lineup of notable musicians: Freddie Hubbard, Eric Dolphy (his second-to-last appearance on a Nelson album following a series of collaborations recorded for Prestige), Bill Evans (his only appearance with Nelson), Paul Chambers and Roy Haynes. Baritone saxophonist George Barrow does not take solos but remains a key feature in the subtle voicings of Nelson's arrangements.Oliver E. Nelson: Liner notes from Impulse! A-5, March 1961 The album is often noted for its unique ensemble arrangements and is frequently identified as a progenitor of Nelson's move towards arranging later in his career. Music Among the pieces on the album, \\"Stolen Moments\\" is the best known and has become a jazz standard: a sixteen- bar piece in an eight-six-two pattern, even though the solos are in a conventional 12-bar minor-key blues structure in C minor. \\"Hoe-Down\\" is built on a forty-four-bar structure (with thirty-two-bar solos based on rhythm changes). \\"Cascades\\" modifies the traditional 32-bar AABA form by using a 16-bar minor blues for the A section, stretching the form to a total of 56 bars. The B-side of the album contains three tracks that hew closer to the 12-bar form: \\"Yearnin'\\", \\"Butch and Butch\\" and \\"Teenie's Blues\\" (which opens with two 12-bar choruses of bass solo by Chambers). Nelson's later album, More Blues and the Abstract Truth (1964), features an entirely different (and larger) group of musicians and bears little resemblance to this record.

It is based in Barrow-in-Furness. The Mail was founded as the North-Western Daily Mail in 1898, becoming the North-Western Evening Mail in 1941 and the North- West Evening Mail in 1987. Although its title suggests a larger area, it in fact only covers news in the South Lakes and Furness. Typically, this is Barrow, Dalton-in-Furness, Ulverston, Grange-Over-Sands, Windermere, Millom, and some of the more notable stories from Kendal and Copeland. It is in a tabloid style, and has three separate editions (Barrow, Ulverston and Millom), though the only difference is the story on the front page. Before changes to printing arrangements it had four - Barrow Early, Barrow Late Final, Ulverston and South Lakes, and Millom: although the only difference was on the front page and page six; the remainder of the paper was the same throughout. Articles typically range between important local news items (such as major council decisions, local business news, etc.), to more personal stories about residents of the area. The Mail is printed and published by Furness Newspapers Ltd., a subsidiary of Carlisle-based media company CN Group Ltd. The current circulation is around 7,500 copies a day (down from 14,500), within South Cumbria (a region with a total population of almost 250,000). Market penetration is at its highest in its core area of Barrow and Dalton, at almost 10 per cent of households and at its lowest in Ambleside.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1967 to 1985, and was Speaker of the legislature from 1977 to 1981. Stokes was a member of the New Democratic Party. Background Stokes was born in Schreiber, Ontario and was educated in the area. He worked as a railway conductor for the Canadian Pacific Railway before entering political life, and became familiar with many Northern Ontario communities that he later represented in the legislature. Stokes was a municipal hydro commissioner from 1959 to 1963, a Credit Union director from 1965 to 1968, and chair of the Local Brotherhood Railway Trainmen from 1955 to 1967. He was a Roman Catholic, and a member of the Knights of Columbus. Politics He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1967 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Raymond Rudiak by 310 votes in Thunder Bay. The riding was mostly rural and pre-dated the naming of the city of Thunder Bay. It covered across much of northwestern Ontario from Lake Superior to Hudson Bay. Stokes was returned by a much greater majority in the 1971 election. He is one of the first MPPs to regularly raise issues regarding First Nations people, and was also committed to issues of the environment, forestry renewal and northern affairs. He was re-elected for the redistributed constituency of Lake Nipigon in the 1975 provincial election. Bill Davis's Progressive Conservatives were reduced to a minority government in this election, and Stokes served as Deputy Speaker in the parliament that followed. Davis's party won a second consecutive minority government in the 1977 election, and the premier appointed Stokes to become Speaker of the Legislature on October 17, 1977. He was the first CCF or NDP member to serve as Speaker, and the first non- government member to hold the position since the United Farmers of Ontario government of the 1920s. Stokes was considered a tough, no-nonsense Speaker who would expel even members of his own party from the house if they were being unruly. He returned to the NDP caucus following the 1981 Ontario election, in which the Progressive Conservatives were returned with a majority government. He supported Jim Foulds for the party leadership in 1982, and did not seek re-election in 1985. By the time of his retirement, Stokes had turned Lake Nipigon into one of the safest NDP seats in the province. =Parliamentary positions= Later life After leaving the legislature, Stokes was active with Lakehead University and Confederation College and also worked on forestry issues.

He was born around 1300. His father, Jean de Charny was the Lord of Lirey in Burgundy and his mother was Margaret de Joinville. His grandfather on his mother's side, Jean de Joinville, was a close friend of King Louis IX and author of his biography. Geoffroi was a knight in the service of King Jean II of France and a founding member of the Order of the Star, an order of chivalry founded on 6 November 1351 by Jean II of France similar to the Order of the Garter (1347) by Edward III of England. He was also the carrier of the Oriflamme, the standard of the crown of France, an immensely privileged, not to mention dangerous, honour, as it made the holder a key target of enemy forces on the battlefield. Geoffroi de Charny was one of Europe's most admired knights during his lifetime, with a widespread reputation for his skill at arms and his honour. It was said that in his time he was known as a \\"true and perfect Knight\\".Barbara W. Tuchman, A Distant Mirror, the Calamitous 14th Century (Published Alfred A. Knopf (1978]. Military career Geoffroi de Charny fought at Hainault and in Flanders, and participated in a crusade under Humbert II of Viennois in the late 1340s. Humbert was a terrible soldier and leader (1) and the crusaders signed a treaty with the Turks in 1348, despite the capture of Smyrna under a previous commander. Blason of the family of de Charny We know from the Chronicles of Froissart that de Charny traveled to Scotland by order of the French King on at least two occasions and was well known to the Scottish nobles of the time. The chronicle describes the French Knight's visit and de Charny briefly in this passage written in Middle English: \\"... Mctray Duglas and the erle Morette knewe of their comynge, they wente to the havyn and mette with them, and receyved them swetely, sayeng howe they were right welcome into that countrey. And the barons of Scotlande knewe ryght well sir Geffray de Chamey, for he had been the somer before two monethes in their company: sir Greffray acquaynted them with the admyrall, and the other knyghtes of France.\\"The Chronicle of Froissart, translated by Sir John Nourchier Lord Berners, introduction by William Paton Ker Vol. IV (London pub. David Nutt Sign of the Phoenix Long Acre 1902) Ch II par 22 ‚Äì out of copyright/ It is recorded and recently translated that Geoffroi was taken prisoner on two occasions. Once was at the battle of Morlaix. It is further recorded that in 1342 Geoffroi was taken prisoner in Brittany, then taken to Goodrich Castle in England, where his captor was Richard Talbot, 2nd Baron Talbot. An English letters patent of October 1343 describes him as having \\"gone to France to find the money for his ransom\\".Calendar of Patent Rolls 1343‚Äì45: 130 It was a rare occurrence that a man would be thus trusted and since he went on to fight other battles, someone apparently paid Geoffroi's ransom, and he was knighted the very next year.Richard W. Kaeuper and Elspeth Kennedy, The Book of Chivalry of Geoffroi de Charny: Text, Context and Translation (Philadelphia, University of Philadelphia Press) Introduction. Another incident which provides insight into Geoffroi's mind is the retribution exacted upon Lombardy-born Aimery of Pavia, the man who betrayed him in his attempted recapture of Calais on New Year's Eve, 1349. Geoffroi conducted a dangerous raid on Aimery's castle. Geoffroi took Aimery captive to St. Omer, decapitated him, quartered his body, and displayed it on the town gates. Kaeuper adds: \\"To show that all this was a private matter and not a part of the business of war (there was currently a truce), Charny took possession only of Aimery himself, not his castle.\\"Richard W. Kaeuper and Elspeth Kennedy, The Book of Chivalry of Geoffroi de Charny: Text, Context and Translation (Philadelphia, University of Philadelphia Press) Introduction.  Negotiations prior to the Battle of Poitiers  Shortly before his death, Sir Geoffroi's dire predictions proved to be truly prophetic and his recorded words exemplify what only a \\"true and perfect\\" medieval knight might be expected to say. They are recorded in the writings of the life of Sir John Chandos and were made in the final moments of a meeting of both sides in an effort to avoid the bloody conflict at Poitiers during The Hundred Years' War. The extraordinary narrative occurred just before that battle and reads as follows: Death The Battle of Poitiers 1356. The oriflamme carried by Geoffroy de Charny can be seen on the top left. The Battle of Poitiers (1356) Eug√®ne Delacroix Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356, a great defeat for the French in which the French king was taken prisoner to England. The French nobility lost here as well as at Crecy, thus their most capable were almost completely wiped out. Froissart‚Äôs words vividly (but inaccurately) describe Geoffroi‚Äôs last actions, his bravery to his King and Country and his dedication to the Oriflamme at the Battle of Poitiers on 19 September 1356: \\"There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king‚Äôs sovereign banner, the Oriflamme. Geoffroi also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king‚Äôs battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.\\"Jean Froissart; Geoffrey Brereton, Chronicles ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. 140 Brass effigy Brass effigy of his son Geoffroi II de Charny The brass effigy is of the son, French knight Geoffroi de Charny II. It is presented for historical reference only since there are no known images of the father. It is said to be an authentic likeness to the father as well and the son. The effigy translation was provided by author Ian Wilson. It states as follows: \\"Here lies the noble man Monsieur Geoffroy de Charny at one time seigneur of Thory, in the district of Beauvais, who died the 22nd day of the month of May 1398. Pray God for his soul.\\"Translation of the brass effigy was kindly done by Ian Wilson (author) for this editor and Wikipedia. http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n66part5.pdf The effigy is frequently represented elsewhere as being of the father but the translation clearly shows it is of Geoffroi II, the son.

This pilgrimage medal is exhibited at the Cluny museum in Paris (France). Literary works Fran√ßais 25447, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, D√©partement des Manuscrits, Division occidentale Geoffroi de Charny's most famous work is his 'Book of Chivalry', written around 1350, which is, along with the works of Ramon Llull and Chretien de Troyes one of the best sources to understand how knights themselves described and prioritised chivalric values in the 14th century. Geoffroi discusses many subjects but above all he values skill at arms over all other knightly virtues and war over all other forms of contest at arms. He was also the author of 'Demands pour la joute, les tournois, et la guerre', in English, 'Questions for the joust, tournaments and war', a book on knightly pursuits. Only the questions survive; however, the way that the questions are phrased, as well as Geoffroi's actions in his lifetime, allow scholars to reach further conclusions about Geoffroi's conception of chivalry and war.

Discographies: Dance Music, Culture, and the Politics of Sound. Routledge. 1999. . \\"The musics which fed into acid house and the developing culture were various too; the heterogeneous sounds of the 'Balearic beat' which helped define it did not constitute a discrete musical genre, but an unholy mix of, among other things, hip hop, house, Mediterranean pop and indie rock. DJs' playlists temporarily situated highly disparate musics beside one another. Musical miscegenation reunited several of the dance forms that had emerged after disco, mixing American and European dance musics. Though house music was the dominant mode, the rapid proliferation of styles and subgenres which followed in its wake, for a short time at least, kept dancefloors moving to a range of grooves.\\"Evans, Helen. Out of Sight, Out of Mind: An Analysis of Rave culture. Wimbledon School of Art, London. 1992. \\"It was in the upmarket clubs of Ibiza: Pacha, Amnesia, Glory's and Manhattans, that Balearic beat was created. DJ's would mix musical forms as diverse as Public Enemy and The Woodentops, to create that eclectic, highly danceable, don't care holiday feel.\\" It later became the name of a more specific style of electronic dance music that was popular into the mid-1990s. Balearic beat was named for its popularity among European nightclub and beach rave patrons on the Balearic island of Ibiza, a popular tourist destination. Some dance music compilations referred to it as \\"the sound of Ibiza,\\" even though many other, more aggressive and upbeat forms of dance music could be heard on the island, such as Balearic trance. History This style was popularized at Amnesia, an Ibizan nightclub, by DJ Alfredo from Argentina, who had a residency there.Kaplan, C.D., Grund, J-P & Dzoljic, M.R. (1989) Ecstasy in Europe: reflections on the epidemiology of MDMA. Instituut voor Verslavingsonderzoek, Rotterdam. DJ Alfredo, whose birth name is Alfredo Fiorito, played an eclectic mix of dance music whose style encompassed the indie hypno grooves of the Woodentops, the mystic rock of the Waterboys, early house, Europop, and oddities from the likes of Peter Gabriel and Chris Rea. He has been credited as the \\"Father of the Balearic beat\\". Similar music was being played, including Pacha and Ku, UK disc jockeys Trevor Fung, Paul Oakenfold, and Danny Rampling are commonly credited with having \\"popularized\\" Balearic beat, specially in the UK. In 1987, after a holiday in Ibiza, Oakenfold and his friends Trevor Fung and Ian St. Paul returned to London, where they unsuccessfully tried to establish a nightclub called the Funhouse in the Balearic style. Returning to Ibiza during the summer of 1987, Oakenfold rented a villa where he hosted a number of his DJ friends, including Danny Rampling, Johnny Walker, and Nicky Holloway. Returning to London after the summer, Oakenfold reintroduced the Balearic style at a South London nightclub called the Project Club. The club initially attracted those who had visited Ibiza and who were familiar with the Balearic concept. Fueled by their use of Ecstasy and an emerging fashion style based on baggy clothes and bright colors, these Ibiza veterans were responsible for propagating the Balearic subculture within the evolving UK rave scene. In 1988, Oakenfold established a second outlet for Balearic beat, a Monday night event called Spectrum, which is credited with exposing the Balearic concept to a wider audience.Reynolds, Simon. Generation Ecstasy : Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture. Routledge. 1999. . It was 1988 when Balearic beat was first noticed in the U.S., according to Dance Music Report magazine. Jose Padilla, is an Ibizan DJ best known for his residency at Caf√© del Mar. Also Jon Sa Trinxa, a british DJ and Producer best known for the longest residency on Salinas Beach at Sa Trinxa defines his style as being Balearic Music. Style Balearic beat records vary between house or Italo house and deep house influenced sounds and a slower R&B-influenced; (under 119bpm) beat consisting of bass drum, snare, and hi- hats (often produced with a Roland TR-909 drum machine) programmed in certain laid-back, swing-beat patterns; plus soul, Latin, African, funk, and dub affectations; and production techniques borrowed from other styles of dance music that were popular at the time. Vocals were sometimes present, but much of the music was instrumental. The sounds of acoustic instruments such as guitar and piano were sometimes incorporated into Balearic beat. Having been primarily associated with a particular percussion pattern that eventually fell out of vogue, the style eventually faded from prominence, and its repertoire was subsumed by the more general \\"chill out\\" and \\"downtempo\\" genres. The style of Balearic beat is described by its inventors, as opposed to its UK followers, as the ability for the DJ to play across a broad range of styles, from early minimal New Beat to the first extended remixes of pop-songs, making Balearic DJ sets those that tend to have the sharpest turns of musical direction. While the public outside Ibiza generally describes Balearic beat as a music style, the island based community regard Balearic beat as a non-style or a healthy disrespect to style conformity and a challenge to the norm. It's a freestyle expression that seamlessly binds sporadic vinyl inspiration through technical flair on the turntables. Today, due to stylistic segregation in electronic dance music, few promoters and DJs dare to stretch the spectrum of styles that far in fear of losing identity and clients. DJ Alfredo still heralds the most diversity among Ibiza DJs, but generally the approach to mixing as well as the terminology, have been swallowed up by the Chillout scene. Ibiza is still considered by some to have its own 'sound,' however, including the music of Jens Gad, co-creator of Enigma, and his new chillout- world-influenced hybrid project, Achillea, recorded in his studio in the hills overlooking Ibiza. Compilations such as Global Lounge Sessions: The Balearic Sound of Ibiza, released in 2002, and Sequoia Groove's Buddha-Lounge series, continue to be released.Sequoia Groove Ibiza-influenced chillout compilations, including the Buddha-Lounge series These generally feature house music and certain downtempo selections, not the old style of Balearic beat, per se. Some prefer to use the term Balearic more generally, however, to apply to all of these styles.

Life The stepson of merchant Polushkin from Kostroma, Fyodor Volkov received a versatile education. He established the very first public theater in Yaroslavl in 1750, which would later bring fame to the then-unknown actors Ivan Dmitrievsky, Yakov Shumsky and others. Two years later, Fyodor Volkov and his theater were invited by Empress Elizabeth to perform at her court, but it would soon be dismissed due to its \\"plebeian\\" nature. Some of the actors were sent to the Szlachta Corps (–®–ª—è—Ö–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ—Ä–ø—É—Å) to get education. In 1756, the empress issued a decree on the establishment of the first permanent public theatre in St.Petersburg under the guidance of Alexander Sumarokov. Fyodor Volkov assisted Sumarokov in managing the theater and five years later became its director after the latter's resignation. Volkov created the Russian professional public theater of national significance, tied it together with progressive dramatic art, and paved the way for a number of Russian actors. He married one of the first actresses in Russia, Maria Ananina. As an actor, Fyodor Volkov mostly played tragic roles, such as the ones in Sumarokov's plays Khorev (–•–æ—Ä–µ–≤), The Refuge of Virtue (–ü—Ä–∏–±–µ–∂–∏—â–µ –¥–æ–±—Ä–æ–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª–∏), Gamlet (–ì–∞–º–ª–µ—Ç; Sumarokov's version of Shakespeare's Hamlet), Semira (–°–µ–º–∏—Ä–∞), Sinav and Truvor (–°–∏–Ω–∞–≤ –∏ –¢—Ä—É–≤–æ—Ä), Yaropolk and Demiza (–Ø—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∫ –∏ –î–µ–º–∏–∑–∞). Having mastered the art of stage acting, Volkov often deviated from esthetic canons of classicism and chose not to follow the universally accepted rules of solemn recitation. In his plays, Sumarokov would often create characters with Volkov's wild temperament in mind. The latter, however, was a very talented comedian, as well. Legacy The Yaroslavl Theatre has been bearing Volkov's name since 1911.

The second controversy was raised in 2005 by Le Qu√©b√©cois about then future Governor General of Canada Micha√´lle Jean and her and husband Jean-Daniel Lafond's ties to the sovereignty movement and the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec.

The ship was built in Glasgow, Scotland in 1858, named Douglas, and operated for the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company between Liverpool, United Kingdom and Douglas on the Isle of Man until November 1862. She was then sold to the Confederacy, renamed Margaret and Jessie, and operated as a blockade runner until her capture by the Union on 5 November 1863. The ship was renamed Gettysburg, and commissioned into the Union Navy on 2 May 1864. During her military service, Gettysburg operated with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, was involved in both the first and second attacks on Fort Fisher, helped lay telegraph cables between Key West and Havana and undertook navigational surveys of the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. Gettysburg was decommissioned on 6 May 1879 and sold two days later. Construction and dimensions Douglas was built by Robert Napier & Co. in Glasgow in 1858. Napier's also supplied her engines and boilers. Her purchase cost was ¬£17,500, plus an allowance from Napier's of ¬£5,000 for the King Orry. Douglas had a tonnage of ; length 205 feet; beam 26 feet; depth 14 feet and a service speed of 17 knots. The first Steam Packet steamer with a straight stern, no fiddle bow and no figurehead. She was launched at 13:30hrs on Wednesday 28 April 1858, the christening of the ship being performed by the wife of John Napier. Also in attendance on behalf of the Isle of Man Steam Packet was Captain Edward Quayle, the Commodore of the Company.Mona's Herald, Wednesday, 5 May 1858; Page: 3 The launch had been delayed for a short period as the berth where her fitting out was to take place was occupied by another vessel. Following her launching she was towed to Launcefield Dock in order to receive her engines.Manx Sun, Saturday, 1 May 1858; Page: 12 Douglas was fitted with a full compliment of lifeboats, these being fitted with Clifford's patent lowering apparatus, which enabled the boats to be lowered safely whilst the vessel was under steam. Below the main saloon and ladies cabin, in one of the watertight compartments was the cargo hold which also contained two fresh water storage tanks each capable of accommodating 500 gallons of water. Moving aft, the cargo hold was followed by the fuel bunkers, furnaces and engines. Pre-Civil War =Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, 1858‚Äì1862= PS (RMS) Douglas (I) No. 20683; the first ship in the line's history to be so named, and the ninth to be ordered by the Company, was an iron paddle steamer which served with the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company until she was sold in 1862. She was sold to Cunard, Wilson & Co, on behalf of the Confederate agents, Fraser, Trenholm & Co. She was renamed Margaret and Jessie and sailed in gray livery for the Confederate States. Due to increasing passenger traffic between the Isle of Man and England, it was decided in 1858 that a larger, faster ship would be ordered for the packet fleet. During trials, she achieved , and was declared the fastest Channel Steamer in existence during the period. Appearance and furnishings Douglas was considered an elegant ship. She had a raised quarterdeck below which was situated a spacious and beautifully fitted up saloon, ladies cabin and sleeping cabins, with accommodation for 100 first class passengers. These cabins ran the full length of the quarterdeck and were lit by large, wide, sky lights two large deck windows and sixteen side windows. The chief saloon was well decorated with three large marble tables with mahogany tops the seats to which had a movable back to allow the occupier to sit either facing toward or away from the table. On the wall at the aft end of the saloon were hung two pictures, one of Douglas Harbour and the other of Liverpool. Seventy people could be accommodated to dine at any given time.Mona's Herald, Wednesday, 7 July 1858; Page: 3 Her deck was said to be clear and roomy with a hurricane deck situated between the paddle boxes which was 50ft long and roofed over on all sides. The steerage passengers were accommodated in the forward part of the ship and as was the case with first class a ladies lounge was provided. Beyond this, and in the immediate vicinity of the forecastle was situated the crew's quarters. Mail and cargo Douglas was designed to carry a mixture of passengers and cargo. Her designation as a Royal Mail Ship (RMS) indicated that she carried mail under contract with the Royal Mail. A specified area was allocated for the storage of letters, parcels and specie (bullion, coins and other valuables). This was situated in the forecastle beneath the crew's quarters and was accessible only by specified ship's officer. In addition, there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo, ranging from furniture to foodstuffs. Maiden voyage Douglas made her maiden voyage from Glasgow to Douglas on Saturday 3 July 1858. Having made passage from the Clyde in a time of 8 hours 30 minutes her arrival off Onchan Head was heralded by cannon fire from the Conister Rock, Fort Anne and the Castle Mona. As she entered Douglas Bay she stopped and embarked several directors of the Steam Packet Company before sailing across the bay several times among a large number of small boats which had put to sea for the occasion. A large crowd had gathered on the Red Pier in order to welcome her and after she had secured alongside many of these people were able to view the interior of the ship with further public viewings made available over the following two days. Douglas was claimed to be the fastest steamer then afloat. She attracted wide attention, and her speed made her a strong candidate for more advanced adventures and was acclaimed as \\"comme le premier\\" among cross-channel steamers.Manx Sun, Saturday, 4 April 1863; Page: 4 Service life Certified by the Board of Trade to carry between 800 - 900 passengers and longer and faster than her forerunners, Douglas was built to help meet the steady increase in passenger traffic to and from the Isle of Man and under the command of Captain Quayle made her inaugural crossing from Douglas to Liverpool on Tuesday 6 July 1858. Douglas achieved over on her inaugural trip and immediately broke the record for the crossing time between Douglas and Liverpool, achieving a time of 4 hours 20 minutes and beat the previous record which had belonged to the Mona's Queen of 4 hours 50 minutes and which had stood since September, 1856.Manx Sun, Saturday, 24 July 1858; Page: 4On the home run Douglas would routinely record a passage time of 4 hours 40 minutes. While in the Steam Packet's colours, the only event of interest ‚Äì apart from the way she broke the record for the home run ‚Äì was her collision with the brig Dido, which cost the Company ¬£400 in damages. One accident which befell a passenger was on Monday 16 April 1860, whilst she was making passage to Liverpool. One passenger, a sailor who had been home on leave from the Royal Navy and who was serving on HMS Majestic, whilst in a state of intoxication scaled his way up the foremast head and got himself on to the fore stay. However, in his attempt to come down he fell some 30 feet to the deck. He was subsequently treated by a doctor who happened to be on board and on arrival in Liverpool was transferred to the Northern Hospital.Mona's Herald, Wednesday, 18 April 1860; Page: 11 Ancillary work consisted of charter sailings and day excursions, one of which was on 14 October 1859, when the Douglas took an excursion to Holyhead to see the ocean liner Great Eastern. Article View Page Text Close Mona's Herald, Wednesday, 26 October 1859; Page: 7At one time she was chartered to Henderson's of Belfast for three weeks for the then notable fee of ¬£200 per week. =SS Margaret and Jessie= After only four years in Steam Packet ownership, Douglas was sold to Cunard, Wilson and Co., who were really acting as brokers for the Confederate Agents, Fraser, Trenholm and Co. for ¬£24,000. Douglas departed her home port for the last time on Sunday 16 November 1862.Manx Sun, Saturday, 22 November 1862; Page: 4 Whilst in Liverpool Douglas was painted light grey and loaded with cargo departed for Nassau under the command of Captain Corbett on Tuesday 2 December 1862,Manx Sun, Saturday, 13 December 1862; Page: 4arriving in Nassau in late January, 1863.Manx Sun, Saturday, 7 February 1863; Page: 4 Douglas made an ideal blockade runner in the American Civil War. She was then owned by the Charleston Import and Export Company. She successfully managed to run the blockade and reached Charleston on 31 January, bringing in much needed supplies and subsequently departed for Nassau with a cargo of cotton. She successfully ran the blockade on numerous other occasions. Douglas was subsequently renamed Margaret and Jessie in honour of the daughters of her new owner, both of whom were on board her during her initial blockade run outbound from Charleston.Manx Sun, Saturday, 21 March 1863; Page: 12 On 1 June 1863 off Nassau Margaret and Jessie was gunned down and driven ashore by a Union gunboat. A few days later she escaped although damaged, went back to blockade running and was later captured. Some records maintain that after she was driven ashore and had escaped to Nassau, she took no further part in the American Civil War, and her engines were said to be seen rusting on the Nassau beach as late as 1926. The official history of the ship in the library of the Department of the Navy, Washington D.C., clarifies the conflicting reports. =1863 capture= Margaret and Jessie was captured as a blockade runner on 5 November 1863 by Army transport Fulton, , and off Wilmington, North Carolina. She was purchased from the New York Prize Court by the Navy and commissioned Gettysburg at New York Navy Yard on 2 May 1864, Lieutenant Roswell Lamson commanding. Refitting She had been armed with a 30-pounder Parrot gun, two 12-pounders, and four 24-pounder howitzers. Her tonnage was now given as 950 and she was apparently lengthened by 16 feet to 221 feet. When commissioned, she had a ship's company of 96. She joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and captured several ships which were running supplies to the South. Civil War =North Atlantic Blockading Squadron= A fast, strong steamer, Gettysburg was assigned blockading duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and departed New York on 7 May. She arrived at Beaufort, North Carolina on 14 May and from there took station at the entrance to the Cape Fear River. For the next seven months, Gettysburg was engaged in the vital business of capturing blockade runners carrying supplies to the strangling South. She captured several ships, and occasionally performed other duties. On 8 October, for instance, she rescued six survivors from schooner Home, which had capsized in a squall. Battle of Fort Fisher Gettysburg took part in the attack on Fort Fisher on 24‚Äì25 December 1864. Gettysburg assisted with the devastating bombardment prior to the landings by Army troops, and during the actual landings stood in close to shore to furnish cover for the assault. Gettysburgs boats were used to help transport troops to the beaches. With the failure of the first attack on the Confederate works, plans were laid for another assault, this time including a landing force of sailors and marines to assault the sea face of the fort. In this second attack on 15 January 1865, Gettysburg again engaged the fort in the preliminary bombardment, and furnished a detachment of sailors under Lt. Roswell Lamson and other officers in an assault, which was stopped under the ramparts of Fort Fisher. Lamson and a group of officers and men were forced to spend the night in a ditch under Confederate guns before they could escape. Though failing to take the sea face of Fort Fisher, the attack by the Navy diverted enough of the defenders to make the Army assault successful. Gettysburg suffered two men killed and six wounded in the assault. Gettysburg spent the remaining months of the war on blockade duty off Wilmington, North Carolina, and operated from April‚ÄìJune between Boston, Massachusetts and Norfolk, Virginia carrying freight and passengers. She was decommissioned on 23 June at New York Navy Yard. Post- war =Caribbean, 1866‚Äì1875= Recommissioning on 3 December 1866, Gettysburg made a cruise to the Caribbean Sea, returning to Washington on 18 February, and decommissioning again on 1 March 1867. Gettysburg went back into commission on 3 March 1868 at Norfolk and put to sea on 28 March on special service in the Caribbean. Until July 1868, she visited various ports in the area protecting American interests, among them Kingston, Jamaica, Havana, Cuba, and ports of Haiti. From 3 July ‚Äì 13 August, Gettysburg assisted in the laying of a telegraph cable from Key West to Havana, and joined with scientists from the Hydrographic Office in a cruise to determine the longitudes of West Indian points using the electric telegraph. From 13 August 1868 ‚Äì 1 October 1869, she cruised between various Haitian ports and Key West. Gettysburg arrived at the New York Navy Yard on 8 October, decommissioned the same day, and entered the Yard for repairs. Gettysburg was laid up in ordinary until 6 November 1873, when she again commissioned at Washington Navy Yard. She spent several months transporting men and supplies to the various Navy Yards on the Atlantic coast, and on 25 February 1874 anchored in Pensacola harbor to embark members of the survey team seeking routes for an inter- oceanic canal in Nicaragua. Gettysburg transported the engineers to Aspinwall, Panama and Greytown, Nicaragua, and returned them to Norfolk on 10 May 1874. After several more trips on the Atlantic coast with passengers and supplies, the ship again decommissioned on 9 April 1875 at Washington Navy Yard. Recommissioned on 21 September, Gettysburg departed Washington for Norfolk, where she arrived on 14 October. Assigned to assist in another of the important Hydrographic Office expeditions in the Caribbean, she departed Norfolk on 7 November. During the next few months she contributed to safe navigation in the West Indies in surveys that led to precise charts. She returned to Washington with the scientific team on 14 June, decommissioning on 26 June. =Mediterranean, 1876‚Äì1879= Gettysburg recommissioned on 20 September 1876, for special duty to the Mediterranean, where she was to obtain navigational information about the coasts and islands of the area. Gettysburg departed Norfolk on 17 October for Europe. During the next two years, she visited nearly every port in the Mediterranean, taking soundings and making observations on the southern coast of France, the entire coastline of Italy, and the Adriatic Islands. Gettysburg continued to the coast of Turkey, and from there made soundings on the coast of Egypt and other North African points, Sicily and Sardinia. On 1 October 1878, while the ship was off the coast of Algeria, Landsman Walter Elmore rescued a fellow sailor from drowning, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. While visiting Genoa on 22 April 1879, Gettysburg rescued the crew of a small vessel which had run upon the rocks outside the breakwater. Decommissioning and fate Her iron plates corroded from years of almost uninterrupted service and her machinery weakened, Gettysburg was decommissioned on 6 May and sold two days later.

It stars Freddie Bartholomew, Tyrone Power, Madeleine Carroll, and Guy Standing. The supporting cast includes George Sanders, Virginia Field, and C. Aubrey Smith. Loosely based on historical events, the film follows the dealings of a man who works for Lloyd's of London during the Napoleonic Wars. Lloyd's of London was a hit; it demonstrated that 22-year-old Tyrone Power, in his first starring role, could carry a film, and that the newly formed 20th Century Fox was a major Hollywood studio. Plot In 1770, youngster Jonathan Blake (Freddie Bartholomew) overhears two sailors discussing something suspicious in his aunt's ale-house in a Norfolk fishing village. He persuades his more respectable best friend, Horatio Nelson (Douglas Scott), to sneak aboard the sailors' ship with him. They overhear a plot involving insurance fraud. When Jonathan decides to warn the insurers, Horatio cannot accompany him, because that same day he is invited to join the Royal Navy as a midshipman. Jonathan walks 100 miles to London to Lloyd's Coffee House, where the insurers conduct their business. Mr. Angerstein (Guy Standing), the head of one of the syndicates that make up Lloyd's of London, listens to him. Instead of a monetary reward, Jonathan asks to work at Lloyd's as a waiter. Angerstein explains to Jonathan that waiters at Lloyd's are also insurers and business promoters. Angerstein teaches him that news, \\"honestly acquired and honestly shared\\", is the lifeblood of the insurance industry. Many years later, when he is a grown man and Lloyd's has moved and become Lloyd's of London, Jonathan shows Angerstein a system of semaphore telegraph apparatuses he has invented, which can relay messages across the English Channel in five minutes. Around the turn of the century, while gathering news in France disguised as a French priest, he rescues Elizabeth (Madeleine Carroll), a secretive young Englishwoman picked up by the French after Napoleon orders the arrest of all English people. On the boat trip back to England, they fall in love. Elizabeth departs before Jonathan learns her full name and residence, but he finds out her address from the driver who transported her. He calls on her uninvited and learns that she is Lady Stacy, married to Lord Everett Stacy (George Sanders), a caddish gambler who has been frequently refused admission to the syndicates at Lloyd's. Insulted at being dismissed by Stacy as a mere \\"waiter\\" at Lloyd's, Jonathan vows to make himself so rich and powerful that even the aristocracy will have to pay him respect.The plot is loose with its historical references in this sequence. The order to arrest all Englishmen in France came in early 1803. During their boat escape, Jonathan and Elizabeth exchange references to Nelson's affair with Lady Hamilton in Naples, which began in 1798 but did not become grist for scandal and gossip until 1801. News posts sequences in the coffee house then advance time from December 1799 to May 1803. Within a few years Jonathan has succeeded in his own very successful syndicate and is known as \\"Lucky Blake\\", but his attitude becomes cynical and hardened, his transactions more like gambling than insurance. He meets Lord and Lady Stacy again and begins seeing her in secret. Stacy, with heavy gambling losses and hounded by creditors, inveigles Jonathan to give him a share of the profits of his syndicate by insinuating he will expose them. But war with France results in disastrous losses in 1805 that threaten to bankrupt Lloyd's. When the insurers raise their rates, British ship owners complain that the charges are exorbitant and refuse to sail unless the old rates are restored. Angerstein proposes that the old rates be restored by persuading the Admiralty to provide armed escorts to the merchant vessels. But Horatio Nelson now commands the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet and Jonathan objects that such a course would reduce Nelson's fleet by half at a time when it needs to keep the French Fleet blockaded in Toulon, putting England's survival in the balance. He commits his syndicate to the old rates without escorts, single- handedly keeping British commerce going and Nelson's force intact. Stacy hounds Jonathan for funds but as the losses mount, the syndicate runs out of money and he refuses. Elizabeth agrees to give her newly inherited fortune to Stacy in return for a divorce. However the French fleet escapes Nelson's blockade anyway and Jonathan is abandoned by his syndicate members. Elizabeth forsakes her divorce and puts her fortune at Jonathan's disposal over his protests. Soon even this runs out. Lord Drayton, First Lord the Admiralty and Stacy's uncle, agrees to order half of Nelson's fleet to convoy the merchant ships. Before the order can be sent, Jonathan receives a letter from Nelson thanking him for his sacrifices and urging him \\"at all costs\\" to protect his fleet from being divided. Determined to buy Nelson more time, Jonathan secretly sends a false message from France reporting a victory by Nelson. Stacy, however, learns that Jonathan was in Calais on the day the message was sent and goes to Angerstein, who warns him that if he denounces Jonathan as a traitor, he himself will be ruined too, since unbeknown to Stacy, Elizabeth's fortune is tied up in the syndicate as well. Stacy finds Jonathan and Elizabeth in each other's arms and shoots his rival in the back. Jonathan, however, has bought enough time for Nelson to win the Battle of Trafalgar, although Nelson dies in the conflict. A recovering Jonathan watches sadly from the window as his childhood friend's funeral procession passes by.

Greene's chief complaint was about the film's authenticity in that the stage would at times become \\"a little too packed with historical figures rather oddly juxtaposed\\", and that the mannerisms of Madeleine Carroll and the overall dialogue made it instantly obvious that this was an American film. (reprinted in: ) The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Art Direction by William S. Darling and the other for Best Film Editing by Barbara McLean. Lloyd's of London was the second of the 29 films directed by Henry King that McLean edited.

Freitas Jr., describes the information processing rate in plants, which are mostly based on hormones instead of neurons like in all major animals (except sponges). Plants can to some degree communicate with each other and there are even examples of one- way-communication with animals. Acacia trees produce tannin to defend themselves when they are grazed upon by animals. The airborne scent of the tannin is picked up by other acacia trees, which then start to produce tannin themselves as a protection from the nearby animals. When attacked by caterpillars, some plants can release chemical signals to attract parasitic wasps that attack the caterpillars.De Moraes, C. M.; Lewis, W. J.; Par√©, P. W.; Alborn, H. T.; Tumlinson, J. H. (1998). \\"Herbivore-infested plants selectively attract parasitoids\\". Nature. 393 (6685): 570‚Äì573. doi:10.1038/31219. A similar phenomenon can be found not only between plants and animals, but also between fungi and animals. There exists some sort of communication between a fungus garden and workers of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa. If the garden is fed with plants that are poisonous for the fungus, it signals this to the ants, which then will avoid fertilizing the fungus garden with any more of the poisonous plant. The Venus flytrap, during a 1- to 20-second sensitivity interval, counts two stimuli before snapping shut on its insect prey, a processing peak of 1 bit/s. Mass is 10‚Äì100 grams, so the flytrap's SQ is about +1. Plants generally take hours to respond to stimuli though, so vegetative SQs (Sentience Quotient) tend to cluster around -2.

Yearwood currently serves as President of the Hip Hop Caucus, a national nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that empowers young people to participate in elections, policymaking and service projects. Yearwood has led or been involved in a number of high-profile campaigns to engage young voters, as well as working on human rights issues in the Gulf Coast region after Hurricane Katrina. Early life and education Yearwood was born in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1969. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of the District of Columbia in 1998 and received a M.Div. degree from Howard University in May 2002. Yearwood was the Student Government President at both schools and was issued an honorary doctorate from Saint Paul University in May 2011. He also served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve as an officer and chaplain. Early activism Yearwood was a co-creator of the 2004 campaign \\"Vote or Die\\" with Sean Combs. He was the Political and Grassroots Director for Russell Simmons' Hip Hop Summit in 2003 and 2004, and functioned as Senior Consultant to Jay Z's \\"Voice Your Choice\\" campaign. He served as a Senior Consultant for P. Diddy's Citizen Change, where he provided a 50-state strategy for engaging the hip hop generation in community-building dialogues. During the 2004 Presidential election, Yearwood, Russell Simmons, and Jonathan Lewis created the \\"Hip Hop Team Vote Bus Tour.\\" Yearwood is also the founder of Hip Hop Voices, a project of Voices for Working Families (AFL-CIO). =H.R. 2206 protest= Yearwood and others protested the United States Senate passage of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 on April 26, 2007. Yearwood was arrested with thirteen other protesters in the Hart Senate Office Building =Guantanamo Bay= Yearwood organized \\"Shut It Down,\\" a hip hop concert at the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC, calling for the end of torture at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp and for the camp's closure. The concert featured Dead Prez and several other hip hop artists. Amnesty International and the ACLU were partners in the event.Cities for Progress, Hip-hop Artists Urge Guantanamo Shutdown(June, 2007) Hip Hop Caucus Yearwood is the president and CEO of the Hip Hop Caucus, founded September 11, 2004, on the premise that the hip hop generation is uniquely qualified to address human- rights for the 21st century. Since its founding, the Hip Hop Caucus has developed a database of approximately 700,000 members and has field teams in 48 cities across 30 states. =Respect My Vote!= In 2008, \\"Respect My Vote!\\", a national voter engagement campaign, was led by the Hip Hop Caucus and spokesperson, multi-platinum, Grammy Award winning rapper, T.I. together with celebrities such as Keyshia Cole, T-Pain, Young Jeezy and others. The campaign successfully registered voters in 12 states and executed a 20 city Bus Tour to Get Out the Vote the month before the 2008 presidential election. In 2010, Yearwood and the Hip Hop Caucus revived the \\"Respect My Vote!\\" campaign to engage new and young voters in the mid-term elections. =Make Hip Hop Not War= During March and April 2007 the Hip Hop Caucus undertook a sixteen city \\"Make Hip Hop Not War\\" national bus tour with hip hop artists, Iraq War veterans, youth leaders, peace and security experts, and members of Congress. Events, rallies and roundtables were held in each city to educate audiences on the costs of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and to motivate young people to take action and have their voices heard. The continuation of the \\"Make Hip Hop Not War\\" campaign throughout 2007 focused on calling for Congress to de-fund the War in Iraq; raising awareness about the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for communities in the USA; and exposing the plight of Iraqi refugees in the Middle East as a result of the war. =Arrest at Petraeus hearing= Yearwood was arrested by Capitol Hill police outside of a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee on September 10, 2007, and charged with disorderly conduct and assault on a police officer. According to Sgt. Kimberly Schneider, spokeswoman for the Capitol Police, Yearwood was stopped from entering the room after allegedly attempting to cut in front of people waiting to get in. \\"What he tried to do was jump to the front of the line. He was told he couldn't do that,\\" Schneider said. \\"And he pretty much charged at the officers to get past them into the room, after he was told not to.\\" In a press release from the Hip Hop Caucus, Yearwood said that he was prevented from entering the hearing because he was wearing a button that said \\"I love the people of Iraq.\\" In the press release he called his arrest an example of \\"democracy while black.\\" UPI reports that the video being circulated on the Internet \\"does not seem to show an assault.\\" Yearwood was treated at George Washington University Hospital \\"for injuries to his ankle\\" according to Liz Havstad, a spokeswoman for the Hip Hop Caucus. In an interview three days later on the Democracy Now! news program, Yearwood told Amy Goodman that he asked Capitol Police if he could leave the line to do a radio interview and was told okay. When he returned to line, he said, he and two other activists were singled out and told they would not be able to enter, and when he tried to find out why, he was arrested. In the interview Yearwood claimed he had torn ligaments in his leg during the incident, and said he was on crutches. =The Gulf Coast Renewal Campaign= Yearwood is known for his activist work as the National Director of the Gulf Coast Renewal Campaign, in which he organized a coalition of national and grassroots organizations to advocate for the rights of Hurricane Katrina survivors. On September 19, 2005, David Banner joined forces with fellow artists and Yearwood for \\"From the Hill to Hood.\\" The event was held in New York City to raise money for survivors of Hurricane Katrina.Daily Hip-Hop News, Heal The Hood Recap: Banner Leads Charge Of 17 Acts For Historical Hip-Hop Relief Concert (September, 2005) Yearwood led the first march in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in November 2005, to protest the racial profiling of survivors in the days after the storm. The march led to convictions of officers who denied basic human rights to African- American families. The following year the Gulf Coast Renewal Campaign successfully pushed back FEMA‚Äôs preemptive temporary housing evictions of Katrina survivors, through public mobilization, two marches in Washington, DC, testimony to Congress, and a public relations campaign. This work earned the Hip Hop Caucus the 30th Annual Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award. =One World One Voice= Yearwood's most recent movement, \\"One World One Voice\\", involves encouraging young people in the US to join the global movement and work to solve climate change. The \\"Green and City\\" campaign engages African American mayors in the movement to \\"green\\" their cities, and the \\"Green the Block\\" is a partnership with the Hip Hop Caucus and \\"Green For All\\" that was launched from the West Wing of the White House in 2009 focusing on education, awareness and service. =Hip Hop Rev= Yearwood was featured in a documentary titled \\"Hip Hop Rev\\" produced by Discovery Communications. During the course of filming, cameras followed Yearwood from his roots in Louisiana, to the birthplace of the Hip Hop Caucus in hurricane hit New Orleans, to community organizing in South East Washington, DC, to a national Clean Energy Bus Tour with former Vice President Al Gore‚Äôs Alliance for Climate Protection, which visited nine cities across America in seven days. \\"Hip Hop Rev\\" premiered on Discovery Communications Planet Green Channel April 23, 2011. =Recent climate activism= Yearwood is on the advisory board of The Climate Mobilization, a grassroots advocacy group calling for a national economic mobilization against climate change on the scale of the home front during World War II, with the goal of 100% clean energy and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. In 2015, Yearwood issued a call \\"to revitalize our economy and put America back to work by declaring a U.S. goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.\\" He added that: \\"Some will no doubt call this bold national goal unrealistic, but they would underestimate the innovative genius and social conscience of the American people. America has a long and proud history of overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds (consider World War II, Apollo program and Abolitionist movement). What is unrealistic is thinking we can put off for decades action that is desperately needed now to ensure our survival as a species.\\" Media appearances Yearwood has appeared on CNN, BET Tonight, Al Jazeera, PBS, Fox, MTV, BBC, C-SPAN, and Hardball with Chris Mathews, and has been featured in the Washington Post, The New York Times and Vibe.

Much like SQL, it is a query language for OLAP cubes. It is also a calculation language, with syntax similar to spreadsheet formulas. Background The MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX) language provides a specialized syntax for querying and manipulating the multidimensional data stored in OLAP cubes. While it is possible to translate some of these into traditional SQL, it would frequently require the synthesis of clumsy SQL expressions even for very simple MDX expressions. MDX has been embraced by a wide majority of OLAP vendors and has become the standard for OLAP systems. History MDX was first introduced as part of the OLE DB for OLAP specification in 1997 from Microsoft. It was invented by the group of SQL Server engineers including Mosha Pasumansky. The specification was quickly followed by commercial release of Microsoft OLAP Services 7.0 in 1998 and later by Microsoft Analysis Services. The latest version of the OLE DB for OLAP specification was issued by Microsoft in 1999. While it was not an open standard, but rather a Microsoft-owned specification, it was adopted by a wide range of OLAP vendors. The XML for Analysis specification referred back to the OLE DB for OLAP specification for details on the MDX Query Language. In Analysis Services 2005, Microsoft added some MDX Query Language extensions like subselects. Products like Microsoft Excel 2007 started to use these new MDX Query Language extensions. Some refer to this newer variant of MDX as MDX 2005. =mdXML= In 2001 the XMLA Council released the XML for Analysis (XMLA) standard, which included mdXML as a query language. In the XMLA 1.1 specification, mdXML is essentially MDX wrapped in the XML \`\` tag. MDX data types There are six primary data types in MDX * Scalar. Scalar is either a number or a string. It can be specified as a literal, e.g. number 5 or string \\"OLAP\\" or it can be returned by an MDX function, e.g. \`Aggregate\` (number), \`UniqueName\` (string), \`.Value\` (number or string) etc. * Dimension/Hierarchy. Dimension is a dimension of a cube. A dimension is a primary organizer of measure and attribute information in a cube. MDX does not know of, nor does it assume any, dependencies between dimensions - they are assumed to be mutually independent. A dimension will contain some members (see below) organized in some hierarchy or hierarchies containing levels. It can be specified by its unique name, e.g. \`[Time]\` or it can be returned by an MDX function, e.g. \`.Dimension\`. Hierarchy is a dimension hierarchy of a cube. It can be specified by its unique name, e.g. \`[Time].[Fiscal]\` or it can be returned by an MDX function, e.g. \`.Hierarchy\`. Hierarchies are contained within dimensions. (OLEDB for OLAP MDX specification does not distinguish between dimension and hierarchy data types. Some implementations, such as Microsoft Analysis Services, treat them differently.) * Level. Level is a level in a dimension hierarchy. It can be specified by its unique name, e.g. \`[Time].[Fiscal].[Month]\` or it can be returned by an MDX function, e.g. \`.Level\`. * Member. Member is a member in a dimension hierarchy. It can be specified by its unique name, e.g. \`[Time].[Fiscal].[Month].[August 2006]\`, by qualified name, e.g. \`[Time].[Fiscal].[2006].[Q3].[August 2006]\` or returned by an MDX function, e.g. \`.PrevMember\`, \`.Parent\`, \`.FirstChild\` etc. Note that all members are specific to a hierarchy. If the self-same product is a member of two different hierarchies (\`[Product].[ByManufacturer]\` and \`[Product].[ByCategory]\`), there will be two different members visible that may need to be coordinated in sets and tuples (see below). * Tuple. Tuple is an ordered collection of one or more members from different dimensions. Tuples can be specified by enumerating the members, e.g. \`([Time].[Fiscal].[Month].[August], [Customer].[By Geography].[All Customers].[USA], [Measures].[Sales])\` or returned by an MDX function, e.g. \`.Item\`. * Set. Set is an ordered collection of tuples with the same dimensionality, or hierarchality in the case of Microsoft's implementation. It can be specified enumerating the tuples, e.g. \`{([Measures].[Sales], [Time].[Fiscal].[2006]), ([Measures].[Sales], [Time].[Fiscal].[2007])}\` or returned by MDX function or operator, e.g. \`Crossjoin\`, \`Filter\`, \`Order\`, \`Descendants\` etc. * Other data types. Member properties are equivalent to attributes in the data warehouse sense. They can be retrieved by name in a query through an axis PROPERTIES clause of a query. The scalar data value of a member property for some member can be accessed in an expression through MDX, either by naming the property (for example, \`[Product].CurrentMember.[Sales Price]\`) or by using a special access function (for example, \`[Product].CurrentMember.Properties(\\"Sales Price\\")\`). In limited contexts, MDX allows other data types as well - for example Array can be used inside the \`SetToArray\` function to specify an array that is not processed by MDX but passed to a user-defined function in an ActiveX library. Objects of other data types are represented as scalar strings indicating the object names, such as measure group name in Microsoft's \`MeasureGroupMeasures\` function or KPI name in for example Microsoft's \`KPIValue\` or \`KPIGoal\` functions. Example query The following example, adapted from the SQL Server 2000 Books Online, shows a basic MDX query that uses the SELECT statement. This query returns a result set that contains the 2002 and 2003 store sales amounts for stores in the state of California. SELECT { [Measures].[Store Sales] } ON COLUMNS, { [Date].[2002], [Date].[2003] } ON ROWS FROM Sales WHERE ( [Store].[USA].[CA] ) In this example, the query defines the following result set information * The SELECT clause sets the query axes as the Store Sales member of the Measures dimension, and the 2002 and 2003 members of the Date dimension. * The FROM clause indicates that the data source is the Sales cube. * The WHERE clause defines the \\"slicer axis\\" as the California member of the Store dimension. Note: You can specify up to 128 query axes in an MDX query. If you create two axes, one must be the column axis and one must be the row axis, although it doesn't matter in which order they appear within the query. If you create a query that has only one axis, it must be the column axis. The square brackets around the particular object identifier are optional as long as the object identifier is not one of the reserved words and does not otherwise contain any characters other than letters, numbers or underscores.

He is considered the \\"father\\" of realist acting in Russia and, via the influence of his student, Glikeriya Fedotova, a major influence on the development of the 'system' of Konstantin Stanislavski (who was born in the year in which Shchepkin died).Golub (1998, 985). Shchepkin's significance to the Theatre of Russia is comparable to that of David Garrick to the English theatre.Benedetti (2005, 102). He distinguished between two kinds of actors, both of whom are dedicated to the art of acting: (1) those who have developed the art of pretense on the basis of intelligence and reason; (2) those who express feelings actually experienced by the actor in performance and work on the basis of \\"a flaming-soul, heavenly spark.\\" Shchepkin considered the effect of the latter approach superior to that of the former.Carlson (1993, 245‚Äî246). He was opposed to the principles advanced by the French playwright and philosopher Denis Diderot in his Paradox of the Actor (published posthumously in 1830), which inverted Shchepkin's evaluation.Benedetti (2005, 104). Life Shchepkin was born in the village of Krasnoe, in the Kursk Province of the Russian Empire, to a serf family owned by Count G. S. Volkenshtein.http://www.answers.com/topic/mikhail-shchepkin Shchepkin's freedom had to be bought by his admirers in 1821. Three years later, he joined the Maly Theatre in Moscow, which he would dominate for the next 40 years‚Äîit became known as the 'House of Shchepkin'.Benedetti (1999, 16). Shchepkin was the first to play Famusov in the Woe from Wit (1831) and the Mayor in The Government Inspector (1836). His acting was acclaimed by Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, Alexander Herzen, and Ivan Turgenev for its subtlety, with much attention given to realistic detail and understatement. Acting philosophy Shchepkin argued that an actor ought to get into the skin of a character, identifying with their thoughts and feelings; observation of life and the actor's knowledge of their own nature provide the source for an actor's work. In 1848 he wrote: Shchepkin's distinction between the 'actor of reason' and the 'actor of feeling' influenced the formation of the ideas about acting contained in the 'system' devised by Konstantin Stanislavski.

Traditional Russian costume consists of straight, flowing lines. Beginning at the turn of the 18th century, the sarafan became the most popular article of peasant women's clothing in the Northern and Central regions of Russia. Sarafans were regularly worn until well into the 20th century, having first been mentioned in chronicles dating back to the year 1376. The origin of the term Sarafan lies in Persia. Old Russia cultivated especially during the era of Grand Principality of Moscow strong ties to Western Asia and countries of the Middle East and served also as an intermediary in the trade between Europe and Asian countries like Persia, as well as Turkey. Sarafan most likely originated from a kaftan-like costume which were worn in Russia by women and men. Sarafans became mostly popular in the Central and Northern Russian regions. Through trade with Central Europe the quality and colour of clothes became better. Sarafans had originally a tighter form but became wider through influence of the Russian Orthodox Church. After the reforms of Peter the Great, which also introduced modern European cultural standards to Russia, only peasants wore the Sarafan, while the upper classes switched to Central European fashion. In many areas of the former Grand Principality of Moscow and today's Southern Russia also the poneva costume was worn by woman. Today the garment is most often seen at performances of Russian folk song, dance and is worn on Russian folk and religious holidays. Designers as well from Russia as from Ukraine are re- imagining the sarafan style with its old national heritage for the 21st century as summertime light dress that can actually be with its modern shape a part of today's woman's wardrobe.What Is a Traditional Russian Sarafan? at aerotranslate.com Gallery File:Fort Ross Woman wearing Traditional Russian Costume b.jpgSarafan worn with a Kokoshnik on a Russian folk festival File:–°–∞—Ä–∞—Ñ–∞–Ω –®–µ–±–µ–∫–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω.jpgA simple black sarafan from Belgorod Oblast File:Traditional Russian Folk Costumes 02.JPGEthnic Russian clothes File:Osenins 0152.JPGRussian women with treshchotka and Russian spoons in their hands.

It is described by Strabo, who had visited it, as a level plain surrounded by mountains: on the south by the Amanus, and on the west by the Antitaurus, which branches off from the Cilician Taurus and contains deep narrow valleys (in one of which was situated Comana, a considerable city on the river Sarus, which flows through the gaps of the Taurus into Cilicia and the Mediterranean). Through the plain of Cataonia flows the river Pyramus, which has its source in the middle of the plain, and also passes through the gaps of the Taurus into Cilicia. The plain is very productive, except that it has no evergreens. Strabo speaks of a temple of Zeus Dacius, where there is a salt-lake of the considerable extent with steep banks, so that the descent to it is like going down steps; it was said that the water never increased, and had no visible outlet. The plain of Cataonia contained no cities, but it had strong forts on the hills, such as Azamora and Dastarcum, round which the Carmalas flowed, probably the modern Zamantƒ± River.A.H.M. Jones, The Cities of the Eastern Roman Provinces (The Clarendon Press, 1937), p. 431 n12. It also contained a temple of Cataonian Apollo, which was in great repute in all Cappadocia. Ptolemy has a list of eleven places in his Cataonia, including Cabassus and Heraclea Cybistra, which is far beyond the limits of Strabo's Cataonia. In fact Ptolemy's Cataonia, if there is truth in it, must be a different division of the country. Cataonia also contains Mut (Claudiopolis). Cucusus, mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary, is today G√∂ksun. The inhabitants of Cataonia were distinguished by the ancients from the other Cappadocians as a different people, but Strabo could observe no difference in manners or in language.

He also played one Test match for England during the first-ever Ashes tour in 1882-83. Biography Vernon was the son of George Vernon of 32 Montagu Square. He was educated at Rugby School, and first appeared at Lord's as a member of the Rugby eleven in 1873, and was captain in 1874. He later went on to play 103 first-class games for Middlesex. Besides the 1882‚Äì83 tour, he also toured Australia in 1887‚Äì88. Vernon toured India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1889-90 as the leader of a team of amateurs, of which the other notable player was Lord Hawke. The other players could not really be said to be first-class, but the team was of a quality much higher than any seen in India at that time. This was the first ever tour by a foreign team to India. They won seven games and drew another before they were due to play the Parsi Gymkhana of Bombay (now Mumbai) on 30 January 1890, just after that great cricket stalwart, Lord Harris, had been named as the next Governor of the Bombay Presidency. The match was billed as being for the \\"Cricket Championship of India\\". At the time it was the greatest sporting event to have happened in Bombay, and to the astonishment of the British rulers, the Parsi side won. Vernon toured India again in 1892-93 as part of a team led by Lord Hawke that also lost to the Parsis. His last first-class game, which was for the Marylebone Cricket Club came in 1898. He represented the England national rugby union team as a forward on five occasions. By profession Vernon was a barrister, who was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple. He was engaged in the colonial service, and worked for the West Africa Police in the Gold Coast Colony at the time of his death. Vernon died aged 46 of malaria fever in the Gold Coast (now Ghana).

The stadium, which seated 10,000 spectators, was built in 1979. At that time it was the venue for the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships tournament. It was also the site of the tennis events for the 1987 Pan American Games. When originally constructed, the complex included 14 outdoor courts, all of which, including the stadium court, had a clay surface. In 1989 an indoor facility featuring 6 DecoTurf Ii courts was added, and the stadium court and other outdoor courts were converted from clay to DecoTurf. Due to the change in playing surface, the name of the tournament was changed to the RCA Tennis Championships. The name of the tournament changed again to the Indianapolis Tennis Championships in 2007 due to the loss of the RCA sponsorship. Changes to the date of the tournament to a less desirable point in the ATP tour combined with the loss of sponsorship resulted in the tournament being sold and moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Maintenance costs due to the loss of tournament income plus IUPUI's need for the land for future development led to the closure of the facility in August 2010 and its subsequent demolition that year.

The cards mostly feature an array of attractive young women, fat old ladies, drunken middle-aged men, honeymoon couples and vicars. He has been called 'the king of the saucy postcard', and his work is collected and appreciated for his artistic skill, its power of social observation and earthy sense of humour. Even at the height of his fame he only earned three guineas a design, but today his original artwork can fetch thousands of pounds. Early life McGill was born in London in 1875. He lost a foot in a school rugby accident, and, having studied at Blackheath Proprietary School where his best friend was Campbell Richard Hone, a future Bishop of Wakefield, spent most of his life in the Blackheath area of south-east London, living at 5 Bennett Park, SE3 ‚Äì a blue plaque location. He was a naval draughtsman until his career in postcards began accidentally in 1904 when an in-law encouraged him after seeing an illustrated get-well card he had made for a sick nephew. Within a year it was his full-time occupation. He studied art and married the daughter of the owner of Crowder's Music Hall in Greenwich. Artistic career McGill spent virtually the whole of his career creating the distinctive colour-washed drawings which were then reproduced as postcards. He ranked his output according to their vulgarity as mild, medium and strong, with strong being much the best sellers. His family, however, was steadfastly respectable. He said of his two daughters, \\"They ran like stags whenever they passed a comic postcard shop\\". Donald McGill in his studioDuring the First World War he produced anti-German propaganda in the form of humorous postcards. They reflected on the war from the opinion, as he saw it, of the men serving, and the realities facing their families at home. Cards dealing with the so-called \\"home front\\" covered issues such as rationing, home service, war profiteers, spy scares and interned aliens. Recruitment and \\"slackers\\" were other topics covered. Many cards were designed to appeal to the soldier who wished to send a card home to his sweetheart and these cards showed couples. Cards showed soldiers in training, and there were many light-hearted jokes about the Scottish soldier and his kilt. A few cards showed images of nursing sisters, and at least one showed three female munitions workers. There were relatively few cards depicting a soldier in action, and some depicted men in the Navy. Only a few of the military-themed cards were serious, such as one showing a British Red Cross medic caring for a wounded German soldier. In 1941, author George Orwell wrote an essay on McGill's work entitled \\"The Art of Donald McGill\\". Orwell concluded that in spite of the vulgarity and the low artistic merits of the cards, he would be sorry to see them go. Approaching 80, McGill fell foul of several local censorship committees, which culminated in a major trial in Lincoln on 15 July 1954 for breaking the Obscene Publications Act 1857. He was found guilty and fined ¬£50 with ¬£25 costs. The wider result was a devastating blow to the saucy postcard industry; many postcards were destroyed as a result, and retailers cancelled orders. Several of the smaller companies were made bankrupt, as they had traded on very small margins. In the late 1950s, the level of censorship eased off and the market recovered. In 1957, McGill gave evidence before a House of Commons select committee set up to amend the 1857 Act. McGill produced an estimated 12,000 designs, of which 200 million copies are estimated to have been printed. He died in 1962 with all his designs for the 1963 season already prepared. He was buried in Streatham Park Cemetery in an unmarked grave. Despite their wide circulation, McGill earned no royalties from his designs; in his will, his estate was valued at just ¬£735. One of his postcards, featuring a bookish man and an embarrassed pretty woman sitting under a tree, with the caption: \\"Do you like Kipling?\\" / \\"I don't know, you naughty boy, I've never kippled!\\", holds the world record for selling the most copies, at over 6 million.1978 American paperback edition of the Guinness Book of World Records. Since that time, records related to postcards have been discontinued. Museum On 10 July 2010, McGill's grandson Patrick Tumber opened the Donald McGill Postcard Museum, created by James Bissell-Thomas in Ryde, Isle of Wight.Donald McGill 'king of saucy postcards' celebrated, BBC News, 10 July 2010, Accessed June 2012 In 1953, Ryde had witnessed police raids on five shops in the town and the seizure of over 5,000 postcards, the majority by McGill. In popular culture McGill's Kipling joke is used in a 1962 episode of The Beverly Hillbillies, \\"Pygmalion and Elly\\", in a scene with Elly May Clampett (Donna Douglas) and Sonny Drysdale (Louis Nye). The Kipling joke is also used in The Muppet Show and in the 1985 film, Clue, in a scene with Miss. Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren) and Col. Mustard (Martin Mull).

Additionally, the venue offers clinics, and there are professionals on staff available for a fee. The $77 million facility was built in March 2000, and was designed by Rossetti Associates Architects. It was a result of former no. 1 US player, tournament chairman and owner of the BNP Paribas Open, Charlie Pasarell, partnering with Raymond Moore, to privately raise the money to fund the $77 million development. When Pasarell and his partners first purchased 88 acres of sand in the middle of the Coachella Valley, many doubted its ability to attract people, as all other major tournaments are located in large metropolitan areas, such as Paris, London, New York City, and Melbourne. However, subsequent owners have shared and built on Pasarell's vision for the center. In 2006, the Indian Wells Tennis Garden was bought by a group of private investors including Tennis Magazine owners George Mackin and Bob Miller, Pete Sampras, Chris Evert, Billie Jean King, Greg Norman, Charlie Pasarell, and Raymond Moore.

She was married to Anton Chekhov. Knipper was among the 39http://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/performing- arts/theater/moscow-art-theater original members of the Moscow Art Theatre when it was formed by Konstantin Stanislavski in 1898. She played Arkadina in The Seagull (1898), played Elena in the Moscow premiere of Uncle Vanya (1899), and was the first to play Masha in Three Sisters (1901) and Madame Ranevskaya in The Cherry Orchard (1904). Knipper married Anton Chekhov, the author of these plays, in 1901. Knipper-Chekhova played Ranevskaya again in 1943, when the theatre marked the 300th performance of The Cherry Orchard. Early life Olga Leonardovna Knipper was born on the in Glazov to Austrian Leonhardt August Knipper and Russian Anna Ivanovna von Saltza of Baltic German descent. Though both of her parents were of German origin, her father claimed Russia as their family heritage. Around the time of Olga's birth, her father, Leonard, was in charge of a factory in a small town north-east of European Russia called Glazov. Two years after Olga was born, her family moved to Moscow, where they became accustomed to an upper-middle-class lifestyle. Growing up in between her two brothers, Konstantin and Vladimir, Olga was pampered extensively. She attended a private school for girls, was fluent in French, German, and English, and took music and singing lessons after rigorous schooling days. Olga showed considerable promise as a painter and was her own accompanist on the piano when she entertained friends and family at dinner parties. Her father, however, who was anxious to conform to the social conventions of his adopted country, made it very clear at an early age that Olga's aspirations in life should be confined to marrying well and becoming a house-wife. Her mother, Anna Ivanovna, though very talented as a singer and pianist, was also forced to give up any hopes of pursuing a professional career in the arts and felt that Olga had to do the same. In 1894, Olga's father died unexpectedly, leaving the 25-year-old and her mother troubled by the outstanding debts he left behind from living well beyond their means. Olga and her mother both began giving music and singing lessons to make ends meet. They also dismissed four of their five servants, and moved into a smaller flat. Olga's hopes of becoming a successful stage actress had not yet diminished. Going ahead with her intentions without her mother's approval and giving up her social circle relations was a sacrifice Olga was willing to make: \\"Whenever in my life I really wanted something, and really believed in the possibility of achieving what I wanted and acted energetically, I always succeeded and never regretted going my own way\\", she wrote. Career She enrolled briefly into the Maly Theatre's drama school, although she dropped out one month later. With the help of her reluctant mother, Olga enrolled at the Philharmonic School, where she was taught by the future co-founder of the Moscow Art Theatre, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko. Nemirovich introduced Knipper and fellow student Vsevolod Meierhold (who would later become one of the most prominent figures of Russian theatre after the Revolution) to Constantin Stanislavski. Told in strict confidence, Nemirovich confessed to Knipper and Meierhold that he and Stanislavski were planning the creation of a new theatre company. Nemirovich assured the two actors that they would be invited to join this company and to help lead it to greatness. After many weeks, enough capital was finally secured to found the new company. The company gathered in Pushkino, where Stanislavski addressed Knipper and the other members, telling them that he hoped they had all come to dedicate their lives to creating the \\"first rational, moral, and universally accessible theatre in Russia.\\" Chekhov Knipper with Chekhov on their honeymoon in 1901. While rehearsing for The Seagull on 9 September, Olga's 30th birthday, she met Russia's most eligible literary bachelor and playwright of The Seagull, Anton Chekhov, then 38. Knipper and Chekhov exchanged telegrams and letters for the next few years, while Olga became more familiar with Chekhov's younger sister, Masha. Random letters of teasing and playfulness became letters of love and deep remorse that they lived so far apart from each other. Olga's true colors shone throughout her letters of correspondence. Her ill- moods, volatile tempers, combined with her sporadic high spirits, kept Chekhov on his toes. In the winter of 1900, Chekhov returned from Yalta and headed to Moscow, with a new play that he had written with a 'dear actress' in mind. \\"What a part I‚Äôve got for you in Three Sisters. Give me ten rubles and you can have it, otherwise I‚Äôll give it to another actress\\", Chekhov wrote to Olga. Many similarities existed between Olga Knipper and the character Chekhov wrote for her in Three Sisters, Masha. Knipper was to play the middle of three sisters and one brother. The only married sibling of the foursome and \\"the most original and talented of the three sisters. To portray a young woman of culture and refinement, who speaks French, German and English, and is a first- class pianist\\" was no problem for Knipper who already acquired those skills. Knipper received much praise for her portrayal as Masha, much to Chekhov's amusement. Anton Chekhov and Olga Knipper eventually married on 25 May 1901 at the Church of the Exaltation of the Cross. It was a spur of the moment, small wedding about which hardly anyone knew, including Chekhov's mother and sister, and Olga's mother. Many close friends and family were hurt by the secrecy. Their marriage ended when Chekhov died of tuberculosis in 1904. It has been claimed in 1902 she had an operation to abort an ectopic pregnancy. The conception must have taken place at a time when she and Chekhov were temporarily living apart and he could not have been the father; as Chekhov was a doctor he would have realised this.Boyd, William Scenes From a Marriage, The Guardian Review, 18 August 2018 Death Olga Leonardovna Knipper-Chekhova worked with the Moscow Art Theatre for the remainder of her life.

It features a 13,800-seat venue named Stadium Court as its centerpiece, and was home of the Miami Open from 1987 until 2018. The Miami Open used twelve courts for competition courts, plus six practice courts. The facility is also home to two European red clay courts, four American green clay courts, and two grass courts. During the majority of the year when the Miami Open is not on site, the Tennis Center is a Miami-Dade County park that is open to the public year-round. All aforementioned playing surfaces, including the stadium court, are available for public use. The Tennis Center at Crandon Park was the third home of the Miami Open. It began in Delray Beach in 1985 and moved to Boca Raton in 1986, before settling in Key Biscayne in 1987. The Miami Open then moved to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens starting in 2019. The Tennis Center is also home to the United States Tennis Association's player development program headquarters and from 1999 to 2010 the 16-and-under Junior Orange Bowl. During the 2013 Miami Masters, plans were unveiled to fully renovate Crandon Park Tennis Center which would include building three permanent show courts. Legal issues regarding restrictions on the Park's usage prevented the plan's implementation. The subsequent move of the Miami Open to Hard Rock Stadium presumably ended any efforts to redevelop the site.

It is based on the cartoon character Felix the Cat. Gameplay NES version screenshot. The player controls Felix the Cat as he sets out to defeat the evil mad Professor who has kidnapped Felix's lovely girlfriend, Kitty. The Game Boy version plays virtually the same as the NES version, but features fewer levels. Felix the Cat has simple game mechanics. The A button is used to jump (press repeatedly to fly or swim), and the B button is used to attack. The type of attack varies depending on the magic level. When Felix falls into the bottomless pit (past the bottom of the level), runs out of time, or loses all his health, he loses a life. Scattered items replenish health and magic. Enemies include moles, tree trunks, cannons, birds, fish, and eight boss monsters. Enemies generally follow a regular pace back and forth, and Felix can shoot them. If Felix takes a hit, his magic power goes down one level. If Felix is at the lowest magic power and gets hit, he loses a life. There are nine worlds.

In 2005, Delta Air Lines sponsored the parade, calling it The Orlando Citrus Parade, presented by Delta Air Lines. Since 2007, Spherion was a major sponsor of the parade along with Delta Air Lines as co-sponsor, being called The Spherion Orlando Citrus Parade, presented by Delta Air Lines. In 2011, the parade was sponsored by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, being renamed as the Fresh From Florida Parade for one year. Now it is known as the Florida Citrus Parade. In 2018 the parade was televised in the Orlando market as the \\"All New Orlando Citrus Parade\\" in a star studded celebration to benefit the Give Kids The World Village. In 2019 the Orlando Citrus Parade organizers choose not to stage the event citing the cost of planning and producing the event. The Florida Citrus Parade was an event which was planned and produced by The Florida Citrus Sports Foundation, as part of the annual Orlando Bowl Week. The event was placed in between the college football games during the last week in December. The parade was previously videotaped and syndicated to over 100 television stations for broadcast during the New Year's Day Holiday; TVS Television Network handles distribution. Visitors to the parade can number over 50,000 along the parade route. The parade would consists of both high school and Bowl-attending university marching bands from the Big Ten Conference or Atlantic Coast Conference and Southeastern Conference, along with theme park characters from Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando. Also, local and national celebrities participates in the event. The main features were the citrus-themed floats. These floats were decorated with citrus fruits in a similar style to the Lemon Festival in Menton, France. They also followed the tradition of the annual Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California. However, instead of decorating the floats with petals, they were decorated with oranges, grapefruits and tangerines. The citrus floats were prepared and filled by over 600 volunteers who gave their time during the 4 days between December 26th and 29th. Then, generally on the last week of December of every year (In rare occasions, the parade was done on the 29th, because December 30 was a Sunday, or 31st of December, if the Citrus Bowl football game comes on January 2), the streets of Downtown Orlando were packed with visitors from other places who came to see their high school marching band and the marching bands for the two universities which would have a match up at the Citrus Bowl that year.

In the series, he is the founder, owner and CEO of Xanatos Enterprises and a member of the Illuminati. Xanatos was voiced by (and his design inspired by) Star Trek: The Next Generation's Jonathan Frakes. Xanatos' behavior is often ruthless and amoral, although his personality is slightly softened later in the series by his affection for his wife Fox and their infant son Alexander. His plans are often intricate and Machiavellian ‚Äî however, he is notably not vindictive as he sees revenge as foolish and even tends to try to see the positive side of his defeats. In fact, Xanatos is notorious for his intricate plans that often have multiple interplaying goals to endeavor that some beneficial result is achieved in one way or another, despite the frequent intervention of Goliath and his clan of Gargoyles. He is obsessed with obtaining immortality for himself and his family. His loyal right-hand man is Owen Burnett, a stoic man with extraordinary hidden talents Xanatos gained through equally remarkable circumstances. Xanatos is a formidable fighter in his own right. In addition to advanced karate and judo skills, he also has a specialized red armored suit modeled on his Steel Clan robots that he wears frequently, with both Xanatos' armored suit and Steel Clan robots appearing to be partly modeled on Goliath's general appearance and size. He also has a highly advanced anthropomorphic AI device modeled after himself, designed to do his bidding; it impersonates and represents him whenever he needs it to. This robot became the leader of the criminal group The Pack under the name of Coyote, and on one occasion, he actually used it to try to capture the actual Coyote spirit. Fictional biography David Xanatos started life as the son of Petros Xanatos, a Greek immigrant who worked a fisherman from Bar Harbor, Maine. Young Xanatos received an anonymous letter that contained a set of valuable 10th-century coins. He sold the coins for $20,000 and invested the money in a series of successful ventures, thus pulling himself out of poverty in the process. He would later embark on a business career, the first steps toward building his own company, Xanatos Enterprises. Despite his father's belief that Xanatos did not deserve the gift that had launched his career, Xanatos continued to claim that he would one day prove himself a self-made man. During this time, Xanatos took on Owen Burnett under his wing, a former employee of business rival Halcyon Renard, as his assistant. Eventually, Burnett revealed that he is actually Puck, a Child of Oberon, and offered Xanatos a tempting choice: a single wish (which could grant the immortality he sought) or a lifetime of service as the mortal Owen Burnett. Against Puck's expectations, Xanatos, confident that he could achieve immortality through other methods, chose Owen's service, and the decision deeply impressed Puck to keep his end of the bargain, with the inference that, should Xanatos achieve his goal, he will be guaranteed Puck/Owen's services for eternity. Xanatos learned of Castle Wyvern from Demona, the only gargoyle from the Wyvern Clan who had neither been destroyed nor put into stone sleep. He purchased the ruins, transported them to Manhattan, and had the structure rebuilt atop his New York skyscraper, the Eyrie Building. With the castle \\"above the clouds,\\" Xanatos successfully released the Manhattan Clan from their frozen sleep. Xanatos initially posed as the Gargoyles' friend, convincing them to \\"acquire\\" technology from his rival Cyberbiotics for him and ultimately attempting to destroy the gargoyles once their replacements, the Steel Clan, came online. The Steel Clan was defeated, however, and Xanatos was convicted for receiving stolen property (\\"Awakening, Part V\\"). Xanatos continued to plot against the Gargoyles from prison, testing them and attempting to remove them from the castle. Upon his release, he became one of their greatest enemies, engaging in a particularly fierce rivalry with their leader, Goliath. Xanatos also committed himself to getting his own clan of gargoyles that would be loyal and obedient to him. To that end, he tried several attempts throughout the series to do that such as resurrecting Goliath's brother Coldstone and some of the other dead gargoyles from the Wyvern Clan; enlisting the services of a \\"freelance geneticist\\" named Dr. Anton Sevarius to craft unwitting human subjects towards genetically creating his own clan of gargoyle-like mutates from humans, one of whom was Elisa Maza's younger brother, Derek; creating a clone of Goliath, and perfecting the Steel Clan. During this time, he also discovered the existence of the Illuminati and became a member. When his attempts to create his own gargoyle clan failed, Xanatos instead changed his goal to acquiring immortality through the use of sorcery and magic, even involving himself with children of Oberon, including Oberon himself ‚Äî the formidable Lord of the mystical island of Avalon. Xanatos would meet an equal in Fox and marry her. It was on this occasion that, by inviting Goliath to the wedding and luring him into seeking reconciliation with Demona, Xanatos was able to reconstruct the Phoenix Gate. The wedding party was brought back in time to the 10th century, where Xanatos arranged for the ancient coins to be delivered to himself a thousand years in the future, via Illuminati, as well as a message to himself describing what to do with them. In this way, Xanatos fulfilled his own history through a predestination paradox, at the same time proving himself to his father as a \\"self-made man\\" (\\"Vows\\"). When Demona finally betrayed Xanatos to advance her own goals of destroying the human race, he was forced to call a truce with Goliath to stop her.\\"City of Stone, Part II\\" Goliath was later instrumental in saving Xanatos's newborn son Alexander, something which Xanatos owed him a great debt, and pledged to pay back to him (\\"The Gathering, Part II\\"). He soon created new robotic bodies for Coldstone's other personalities to inhabit, which he named Coldfire and Coldsteel. Since these gargoyles were also created by magic, though, it was impossible for mind transfer to occur. While he and Fox were out to dinner, Puck and Alexander performed the transfer for him. When the existence of the gargoyles was revealed to the public, Xanatos puts an end to the feud between them and voluntarily allows the gargoyles to come back to live in their ancestral castle (\\"Hunter's Moon, Part III\\"). Relationships Though at first Xanatos seems to have an on and off partnership with Demona when neither magic nor technology seem to be enough to accomplish what they plan to do, neither Xanatos nor Demona seem to truly trust one another. This proves to be a fatal flaw on their part, that tends to doom their future plans towards failure. In general, Xanatos has an odd way of dealing with those he \\"loves\\". One example can be found in Thailog, Goliath's clone that he had Sevarius create. While the clone was being grown he had a program playing giving him information about the world and his beliefs. He seemed to have a paternal feeling towards Thailog as, when the gargoyle was kidnapped during his stone slumber, he would not let Owen fire on the kidnappers out of fear of hurting Thailog, and handed over $20,000,000 for his safe return without a second thought. He even showed pride in Thailog's manipulative abilities and genius when he found out the clone had engineered the entire plot to abscond with the money, referring to him as \\"a chip off the ole block\\". He even expressed to Thailog that if he wanted the money he would have given it to him if he would have asked for it. However his paternalism seems thin as, when he thinks Thailog died during battle with Goliath, he states that he knew the whole time that a copy (Thailog) couldn't match the original (Goliath), which infuriates Goliath as Xanatos was able to dehumanize a living being to such terms. Though arguably lacking romance, Xanatos asks Fox to marry him on the basis that \\"it makes sense\\" because they are genetically compatible, share the same interests, and \\"love each other\\" as much as two people such as themselves can. Though he does love Fox, he is shown using her to get what he wants as well. In the Halloween episode, Xanatos gives Fox the Avalon-crafted Eye of Odin as an engagement gift. The necklace holds unfathomable occult powers that Fox cannot control. It turns her into a large red-haired beast, looking like a 'fox'-human hybrid bearing a resemblance to a werewolf. Though Xanatos suspects it has an effect on her, he does not fully understand, until he witnesses Fox transform in front of him. Terrified by what he has set into motion, he asks Goliath and Elisa for assistance, though they are initially reluctant. Goliath seems especially perturbed at how he has treated Fox and seemingly disregarded her life. As Fox continues to go on rampages in search for food, Xanatos, Goliath, and Elisa scour the city for her. Eventually, they chase her to a rooftop and Goliath is able to free Fox from the Eye of Odin after electrocuting her with a neon sign. While preparing to leave and while holding Fox in his arms, Xanatos regretfully informs Goliath that now he knows his only weakness. Goliath turns to him, slightly disgusted and remarks, \\"Only you would regard love as a weakness.\\" These words leave Xanatos speechless, but silently admits. In the episodes of the Gathering, Xanatos seems instinctively protective of both Fox and Alexander, seemingly having come to terms with the idea of love not being a weakness.  Appearance in media  =SLG Comic= Soon after, Owen received a call from Mr. Duval from The Illuminati for Xanatos. Xanatos refused as he spent some time with his son that night. On Halloween Night, he's later visited by Martin Hacker (who ranks 32 in The Illuminati) who gives him an invitation to the White House. From there he meets another Illuminati member, Quincy Hemings (Chief Stewart at the White House who ranks 2 in The Illuminati). He hands Xanatos a mission from The Illuminati. The mission is for him to obtain The Stone of Destiny which is being sent back to Scotland. To ensure success, he recruits Coldsteel and activates Coyote 5.0. He sends some Steel and Iron Clan robots to assist them. =The Goliath Chronicles= The third season of Gargoyles was called The Goliath Chronicles. In this season, Xanatos was portrayed as a benefactor to the Gargoyles. Greg Weisman, the main writer behind Gargoyles, disagreed with how Xanatos is portrayed in the Goliath Chronicles. Weisman has stated that he believes that if the feud with the clan ended, Xanatos would still seek to achieve his own goals (as according to Greg will be demonstrated in #4 or 5 of the SLG series). This is acknowledged by Brooklyn and Goliath in #1 of the Slave Labor Graphics comic book series continuation that while he isn't 100% trustworthy, they trust him not to smash them during the day. In the Goliath Chronicles, Xanatos must deal with pressure from The Illuminati in terms of turning the clan over to them.

Hero of Socialist Labour (1974) and People's Artist of the USSR (1949). Early years Igor Ilyinsky was born on 24 July 1901 in Moscow. At age 16 he entered the Theatre Studio of Theodore Komisarjevsky and in half a year already debuted on the professional stage in Komissarjevsky Theatre. His first theatre role was that of the \\"Old Man\\" in Aristophanes' play Lysistrata. In 1920, he joined the Vsevolod Meyerhold Theatre. The young actor's style was in correspondence with the principles of Meyerhold, and so Ilyinsky soon became the central actor of that theatre. Career in silent cinema In the mid-1920s Ilyinsky started to appear in movies, where he also played vivid comic characters. In 1924, Yakov Protazanov featured him in his famous futuristic film Aelita, which was followed by his role in Protazanov's comedy The Tailor from Torzhok (1925). In 1926, he appeared in three films. > ‚ÄúI can act on the roof of a train carriage, on the radiator of a moving car, > on back of a galloping horse, or while swimming in the sea‚Äù. 1930s-1950s In 1938 he joined the Maly Theatre that had been his favourite one since school years. Afterwards Ilyinsky stayed in the Maly Theatre for almost fifty years and even staged several plays there himself. Ilyinsky would later write that it was Russian classic literature that had helped him overcome the crisis and feeling that he had been unable to create new characters, different from the previous ones. An outstandingly prolific period in the actor's life was related to his work with the famous film director Grigori Aleksandrov. In 1938 Ilyinsky splendidly acted as Byvalov in the comedy Volga-Volga (for this role, he was awarded Stalin Prize in 1941). He deliberately avoided any comic traits in his character to create a common image of a red-tapist. The starting point for him was the gracious and stirring character of Lyubov Orlova. He decided to create a totally contrasting character, which he succeeded in. That role brought Ilyinsky the State Prize. Stalin reportedly watched the film sixteen times. At Molotov's birthday party Stalin flung Ilyinsky a remark: ‚ÄúAh, Byvalov! You are a bureaucrat and I am a bureaucrat. We shall understand each other‚Äù. The success of that movie determined the development of Soviet film comedy for the next several decades. However, after the film Ilyinsky almost stopped his film acting. In the mid-1950s Ilyinsky finally got a chance to act in a movie. It was a light comedy, A Crazy Day. The character created by Ilyinsky was a repetition of what he had done 20 years earlier. He managed to play a truly starry film role only 18 years after Volga-Volga. It was the role of the bureaucrat Ogurtsov in the smash-hit comedy The Carnival Night, directed by Eldar Ryazanov. > ‚ÄúI was not going to feature the great Igor Ilyinsky in The Carnival Night - > I felt timid, and understood that being a coryphaeus he would suppress me. > When Pyriev offered him for the role of Ogurtsov, I just panicked: he was my > idol from childhood, the famous actor of the Meyerhold Theatre! And me, > directing my first film, on the other scale!‚Äù (Eldar Ryazanov) Later years In Maly Theatre at the same time Ilyinsky shifted to portrayals of deeply tragic characters, in particular, from Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy. In the late 1960s Ilyinsky went into stage directing. His first stage production was the stage version of Gustave Flaubert's popular novel Madame Bovary. The last period of Ilyinsky's career was marked by his portrayal of Leo Tolstoy in the play Turning Full Circle and of Firs, and his performance in The Cherry Orchard by Anton Chekhov. As a very old person Igor Ilyinsky acted a lot on the radio ‚Äì almost blind, he was accompanied to the studio. Death Igor Ilyinsky died on 13 January 1987, aged 85. His widow, actress Tatyana Yeremeyeva, died on 29 November 2012, aged 99.Notice of death of Tatyana Yeremeyeva Legacy * A minor planet 3622 Ilinsky, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1981 is named after Igor Ilyinsky.

His preaching was noted as being exceptionally powerful, \\"as if talking fire down from heaven\\". On one occasion it is said he preached to a crowd of 10,000 people. He was a strict High-Calvinist who believed in the literal truth of the Bible. At one stage he argued strongly for the doctrine of election. He came to be known as Y Pab Methodistaidd in Welsh (The Methodist Pope) because of his forthright views. Despite his wide interests, he was a religious conservative who opposed all forms of political Radicalism as well as the assertion, popular at the time amongst Nonconformists in Wales, that \\"the voice of the people was the voice of God\\".  Biography  John Elias was born at Abererch near Pwllheli on 6 May 1774 as John Jones. For much of his early life he was brought up by his grandfather, and possessed the rare ability at the time to read both Welsh and English from an early age. He was able to read the Welsh Bible when between four and five years old. On Sundays they attended the parish church in the morning, and in the afternoon they would walk long distances together in order to hear some of the Methodist Revivalists. The religious impressions of his younger days were deepened by a visit to Bala Association or Synod in 1792. The preaching there persuaded Elias to become further involved in the Christian faith. He left home and stayed with Griffith Jones at Penmorfa, Caernarvon, a weaver by trade and also a local preacher. Some weeks before being received into church-fellowship, he conducted family prayers during the absence from home of his master. The news of this spread abroad and caused a stir in the religious circles of the neighbourhood. They marvelled that he should pray in public. Griffith Jones commented - \\"His penetration and importunity in his prayers made us all marvel greatly.\\" \\"A day to remember,\\" he wrote, \\"was that one day - Christmas Day in the year 1794 - when I was received a member of the Monthly Meeting, and permission was given me to preach the Gospel of Christ. I was then only twenty years and six months old, and only one year and three months old as professor of religion.\\" His progress as a preacher was very rapid. He proved himself to be a gifted young man, a born speaker. His passion also for work was intense. With all his might he laboured night and day in order to make amends for what was lacking in former days. He was received into the Caernarvonshire Presbytery of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists at Christmas 1794. Soon after New Year's Day 1799 he moved to Anglesey. On 22 February he married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Broadhead of Llanbadrig, Anglesey. The couple were happy, loving and deeply sympathetic with one another, they enjoyed a life of sweet companionship for over twenty-nine years, until her death on 2 April 1828. They had four children; two of them died in infancy and two survived their father. In 1830 following his second marriage he moved to Llangefni, where he lived until the day of his death, 8 June 1841. He is buried at Llanfaes Churchyard. A celebrated clergyman of the Church of England wrote in his diary,--\\"To-day, June 15, was buried the greatest preacher in Wales, and, perhaps, the greatest in the kingdom. May the Lord have mercy upon his church, and favour her again with such a minister as Elias was, like a flaming seraph in the pulpit.\\" 10000 people are estimated to have attended his funeral.  Writings  John Elias was the author of numerous works in Welsh, all on a theological or doctrinal theme. He contributed regularly to the early Calvinistic Methodist periodical Y Drysorfa and wrote an autobiography, which was published long after his death. His most influential works in his day were Traethawd ar y Saboth (1804) and Golygiad Ysgrythurol ar Gyfiawnhad Pechadur (1821).

In comparison to many European monarchies' regalia, the Dutch regalia are relatively new: having been commissioned by King William II in 1840. An earlier, more modest set of regalia made of silver was commissioned by King William I in 1815.A.J.P.H. van Cruyningen, De inhuldiging van de Nederlandse vorst. Van Willem Frederik tot Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard (unpublished MA thesis, Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen, 1989) 61. Dutch monarchs are not and have never been crowned but are instead sworn-in and inaugurated in a ceremony at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. The regalia (not including the royal mantle) are never bestowed upon or worn by the monarch. Instead, the crown, sceptre, and orb are placed on what is called a credence table during the ceremony while the sword and standard are carried by different officials. A number of jewellery worn by the Dutch royal family are termed as the Crown Jewels and are not part of the regalia. Regalia The Dutch crown The regalia of the Netherlands consist of the following: * the crown, symbolising the sovereignty of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which currently consists of the Netherlands in Western Europe and three overseas countries in the Caribbean: Cura√ßao, Sint Maarten and Aruba. It also symbolises the dignity of the Sovereign as head of state. The renowned Amsterdam jewelry firm Bonebakker was commissioned to make the crown. The execution were left to master gold- and silversmith Theodorus Gerardus Bentvelt. It is made of gilded silver, adorned with coloured stones and imitations of pearls,Van Cruyningen, 61‚Äì62. and has eight arches with a monde and cross at the top. * the sceptre, symbolising the reigning King or Queen‚Äôs authority; * the orb, symbolising the Sovereign territory; Both sceptre and orb were made by court jeweler Meijer from The Hague.Van Cruyningen, 62. * the sword of state, standing for the Monarch's power; * the gonfalon of state (Rijksvaandel or Rijksbanier), a banner of white moir√© silk suspended from a gilded spear, painted with the coat of arms of the Netherlands as decreed on 24 August 1815, symbolising the nation.

The mantle, which is not part of the regalia, is made of purple velvet and is trimmed with ermine. 83 lions, embroidered in gold, adorn the mantle. The mantle was first used in 1815 and has been redesigned several times to fit the various monarchs and reflect the changing fashions. The lions are old and were part of King William I'st mantle. Part of the fur has been renewed or replaced and in 1948 the velvet was in such a poor condition that the Swiss couturier who was responsible for its adaptation had no choice but to replace in with a modern fabric.Kleren voor de elite. p.36  Usage  Procession to the inauguration of Queen Juliana in 1948.

These shamans specialized in communicating, appeasing, or harnessing the spirits of the dead and the spirits of nature. They were almost always women or feminized men (asog or bayok). They were believed to have spirit guides, by which they could contact and interact with the spirits and deities (anito or diwata) and the spirit world. Their primary role were as mediums during pag- anito s√©ance rituals. There were also various subtypes of babaylan specializing in the arts of healing and herbalism, divination, and sorcery. Terminology A ritual of the Iraya Mangyan to prepare land for kaingin (swidden farming) The most common native terms for shamans among Austronesian groups in Island Southeast Asia are balian, baylan, or cognates and spelling variants thereof. They are all derived from Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian *balian, meaning \\"shaman\\" (probably originally female, transvestite, or hermaphroditic) or \\"medium\\". Various cognates in other non-Filipino Austronesian languages include babalian, bobolian, and bobohizan (Kadazan- Dusun); wadian (Ma'anyan); belian (Iban); belian (Malay); walen or walyan (Old Javanese); balian (Balinese); bolian (Mongondaw); balia (Uma); wulia or balia (Bare'e); balia (Wolio); balian (Ngaju); and balieng (Makassar). However *balian-derived terms have largely disappeared among lowland Filipinos after Christianization in the Spanish era. Some exceptions include Bikol where it persisted and acquired the Spanish feminine suffix -a as balyana. It also survives among some Muslim Filipinos like in Maranao walian, although the meaning has shifted after Islamization. The linguist Otto Dempwolff has also theorized that *balian may have ultimately derived from Proto-Austronesian *bali (\\"escort\\", \\"accompany\\") with the suffix *-an, in the meaning of \\"one who escorts a soul to the other world (a psychopomp)\\". However, the linguists Robert Blust and Stephen Trussel have noted that there is no evidence that *balian is a suffixed form, and thus believe that Dempwolff's interpretation is incorrect. More general terms used by Spanish sources for native shamans throughout the archipelago were derived from Tagalog and Visayan anito (\\"spirit\\"), these include terms like maganito and anitera. However, different ethnic groups had different names for shamans, including shamans with specialized roles. These include: *Abaknon: tambalan *Aeta/Agta: anitu, puyang (also poyang, pawang, pauang), huhak (diviner) *Bagobo: mabalian *Balanguingui: duwarta *Banwaon: babaiyon (also the female datu of the tribe) *Bikol: baly√°n, baly√°n-a, balyana, paraanito, paradiwata *Bukidnon: baylan *Gaddang: mailang *Hanun√≥'o: baly√°n, baly√°n-an *Higaonon: baylan *Ibaloi: mambunong *Igorot (Ifugao): mandadawak, dawak, insupak, mon-lapu, tumunoh, alpogan, mumbaki, manalisig (apprentice) *Ilocano: baglan, mangoodan, manilao, mangalag (medium), mangngagas (herbalist) *Isneg: alopogan, dorarakit, anitowan *Itneg: mandadawak, alpogan *Ivatan: machanitu (medium), maymay (midwife), mamalak (diviner) *Kankana-ey: manbunong (medium), mansib-ok (healer), mankotom (diviner, also mankutom) *Kapampangan: katulunan (also catulunan) *Karay-a: ma-aram, mangindaloan (healer), soliran (diviner, also soli-an) *Lumad: balian, balyan, mabalian *Maguindanao: walian (female shaman, midwife), pendarpa'an (medium), pedtompan (medium), tabib (healer), pangagamot ([apprentice] healer, also ebpamanggamut), ebpamangalamat (diviner) *Mamanwa: baylan, binulusan, sarok, tambajon (healer, also tambalon) *Mandaya: baylan, balyan, baliyan *Manobo: beylan, baylanen (also baylanon), manhuhusay (mediator, keeper of traditions, also tausay), manukasey (healer against sorcery), walian or walyan, diwata (head shaman) *Maranao: walian, pamomolong *Palaw'an: beljan *Sama-Bajau: balyan, wali jinn, dukun, papagan, pawang, bomoh, kalamat (diviner), panday (healer, midwife) *Sarangani: magbulungay *Subanen: balian, tanguiling *Suludnon: banawangon *Tagalog: katalonan (also katalona, catalona, catalonan), manganito, sonat, anitera (or anitero), lubus (herbalist), manggagamot (healer), manghuhula or pangatahoan (diviner), hilot (midwife) *Talaandig: walian *Tausug: mangubat (also mangungubat, magubat), pagalamat (diviner) *Tagbanwa: bawalyan, babaylan *T'boli: tao d'mangaw, tao mulung (healer) *Visayan: babaylan (also babail√°n, babailana), baylan (also balyan, balian, baliana, vaylan), daetan (also daytan, daitan), katooran (also catooran), mamumuhat, makinaadmanon, diwatera (or diwatero), anitera (or anitero), mananambal (healer), himagan (healer), siruhano (herbalist), manghuhula or manghihila (diviner), mananabang (midwife) *Yakan: bahasa According to Jaime Veneracion, Katalonan incorporates the root talon which in ancient Tagalog meant \\"forest\\" (cf. Hiligaynon, Masbatenyo, Inabaknon, Capisano, Palawano, Buhid, and Agutaynen talon, \\"forest\\" or \\"thicket\\"). Other scholars believed that the origin of the word catalonan is from its root word ‚Äútalo‚Äù which according to them is a Tagalog word originally means \\"to converse\\", thus the word catalonan literally means someone who converse or communicate with the spirits (anito). According to Blumentritt an old Tagalog word ‚Äútarotaro‚Äù is a term describing the catalonas while possessed by the spirits (anito). In some Malayo-Polynesian languages such as Tahitian ‚Äútarotaro‚Äù means ‚Äòto pray‚Äô, while in Rapanui it means ‚Äòa malediction or curse‚Äô. In Samoan ‚Äútalo or talotalo‚Äù means ‚Äòa prayer or to pray‚Äô. Linguist Malcolm Mintz, however, offers a different etymology. He determines that the Tagalog root word is ‚Äútulong‚Äù which means to help. Some writers such as William Henry Scott and Luciano P. R. Santiago favoured Mintz suggestion and used the term catolonan (which is actually a Pampangan term) to refer to the priests and priestesses of the Tagalogs instead of catalona or catalonan. Initiation Itneg shamans (the two women in the foreground) conducting a sayang ritual (c. 1922) Most babaylan inherited their status from an older babaylan they were apprenticed to, usually a relative. In some cultures, like among the Isneg people, older shamans can choose apprentices from among the eligible young women of the village. A few, however, become babaylan after experiencing what has been termed a \\"shamanistic initiatory crisis\\" (also \\"shamanic illness\\" or \\"shamanic madness\\"). This includes serious or chronic illnesses, near-death experiences, sudden seizures and trembling, depression, strange events or behavior (including climbing balete trees or disappearing for several days with no memory of the events), bouts of insanity (including those induced by psychological trauma from a past event), and strange visions or dreams. These are regarded as encounters with the spirits, where the soul of the person is said to be journeying to the spirit world. In cases like this, it is said that a spirit chose the person, rather than the other way around. After being chosen, shamans go through an initiation rite. These rites are meant to gain or transfer the patronage of a spirit. Among Visayans, this ritual is known as the tupad or tupadan. In cases of people with \\"shamanic illness\\", these initiation rites are regarded as the cure, where the initiate regains health or sanity by conceding to the wishes of the spirits and \\"answering the call\\". When volunteered rather than volunteering, their relatives are usually required to pay a large fee to the senior shaman for the training. Initiation rites can range from simply inducing a trance through herbs or alcohol, to inducing personal crises through physical or psychological hardship. Extreme examples of initiation rites include getting buried alive or being immersed in water overnight. After initiation, the apprentices are then trained in the details of their role. This training includes learning about the rituals, the chants and songs, the sacrifices appropriate for each spirit, oral histories, herbs and healing practices, and magic spells, among others. They usually assist the senior shaman during ceremonies until their training is complete, which can take months to years. Each shaman can have one or more such apprentices, at varying ranks or specializations. =Spirit guides= Ifugao mumbaki overseeing the ritual sacrifice of a pig during the dipdipo ritual The shaman's power to communicate with the spirit world is derived from their spirit companions that guide them and intercede for them. These spirits are usually referred to in euphemistic terms like abyan (\\"friend\\"), alagad or bantay (\\"guardian\\"), or gabay (\\"guide\\"), among other terms. Shamans have at least one abyan, with more powerful shamans having many. Certain individuals like powerful leaders or warriors (especially those with shaman relatives) are also believed to have their own abyan that give them magical powers. Abyan are also believed to guide, teach, and inspire skilled artists and craftsmen in the community. Abyan spirits can be ancestor spirits, but they are more commonly non-human spirits. Shamans either had spirit companions from birth, drew their attention during the \\"shamanic illness\\", or gained their allegiance during initiation into shamanism. Spirits are believed to be social beings, with individual quirks and personalities (both good and bad). The friendship of abyan depend on reciprocity. The shamans do not command them. People with abyan must regularly offer sacrifices to these spirits, usually consisting of food, alcoholic drinks, ngang√†, and blood from a sacrificial animal (usually a chicken or a pig)These sacrifices vary depending on the type of spirit being interacted with (Buenconsejo, 2002) in order to maintain good relations. This friendship of abyan, once earned, is enduring. They become, in essence, part of the family. The abyan of a deceased shaman will often \\"return\\" to a living relative who might choose to become a shaman as well. The abyan are essential in shamanistic rituals as they prevent the shaman's soul from getting lost in the spirit world. They also communicate entreaties on behalf of the shaman to more powerful spirits or deities, as well as fight evil spirits during healing or exorcism rituals. =Sex and gender= Itneg potters, the person on the right is a bayok in female attire (c. 1922) In most Philippine ethnic groups, shamans were predominantly female due to the role of the shaman (especially the medium) being an intrinsically feminine one. Among the minority of males, most belonged to a special class of shamans‚Äîthe feminized men known as asog in the Visayas and bayok or bayog in Luzon.Asog is from Proto-Western-Malayo- Polynesian *asug, \\"shaman in ritual transvestite attire\\"; and Proto-Central Philippine *√°sug, \\"sterile\\" or \\"asexual\\". Asog is the term used for transvestite male shamans in most of the Visayas and in the Bicol Region. Other Visayan terms include bantot, bayog, binabaye, and babayenon. In the rest of Luzon, they are known as bayok (bayoc), bayog, bayogin (bayoguin or bayoquin), binabae, or bido. Notably among the Sambal, the highest-ranking shaman was a bayok. They are also known as labia among the Subanen, though they were not necessarily shamans (Garcia, 2008; Kroeber, 1918). In modern Filipino languages, the most commonly used terms are bakla, bayot, or agi. See also Bakla The asog assumed the voice, mannerisms, hairstyle, and dress of females. They were treated as women by the community and were considered as comparable to biological women aside from their incapability to give birth to children. Their social status and recognition also granted them access to professions related to the spiritual realm, such as shamans and religious functionaries. In Historia de las islas e indios de Bisayas (1668), the Spanish historian and missionary Francisco Ignacio Alcina records that the asog became shamans by virtue of being themselves. Unlike female shamans, they neither needed to be chosen nor did they undergo initiation rites. However, not all asog trained to become shamans. Castano (1895) states that the people of Bicol would hold a thanksgiving ritual called atang that was \\"presided\\" by an \\"effeminate\\" priest called an asog. His female counterpart, called a baliana, assisted him and led the women in singing what was called the soraki, in honor of Gugurang.Castano, Jos√©. 1895. ‚ÄúBreve Noticia Acerca del Origen, Religi√≥n, Creencias y Supersticiones de los Antiguos Indios del B√≠col.‚Äù Madrid: Colegio de Misioneros de Almagro. Historical accounts suggest that during the precolonial period in the Philippines, the female shamans predominated in the religious realm.From paragraph 26 (Brewer 1999): This prevalence of the male in matters spiritual was not replicated in the Philippine case, where it was the female shamans who predominated in the religious realm. The Bolinao Manuscript (1685), for example, records that during an Inquisitional investigation of the shamans in the town of Bolinao between 1679 and 1685, animistic paraphernalia were confiscated from 148 people. Of those, 145 were female shamans, and the remaining three were transvestite male shamans, thus highlighting the statistical imbalance between the female-to-male ratio of indigenous shamans. The anonymously-written \\"Manila Manuscript\\" also emphasized the auxiliary role of gender non- conforming male shamans in relation to the female shamans. These evidences, together with the fact that there were no written accounts of female sex/male gender identification amongst the women who exercised authority within the spiritual sphere, prove that spiritual potency was not dependent upon the identification with a neuter \\"third\\" sex/gender space, but rather on the identification with the feminine ‚Äì whether the biological sex was female or male. Femininity was considered the vehicle to the spirit world during the pre-colonial era, and the male shaman's identification with the feminine reinforced the normative situation of female as shaman. While Brewer (1999) agreed that it is na√Øve to dismiss the existence of a principal male shaman during the precolonial era, she also argued that such cases were unusual rather than the norm, and that the statistical imbalance in favour of principal male shamans occurred as a result of the influence of the male- centered Hispano-Catholic culture, such that in the late nineteenth century and in the early years of the twentieth century, in some areas like Negros, all the babaylan were male.For the previous statement regarding the Bolinao Manuscript, see paragraph 29. For the previous statement related to the Manila manuscript, see paragraph 31. For Brewer's comment regarding the spiritual potency of the shaman depending on identification with femininity and not on the identification with the neuter or third sex gender, see paragraph 34. Lachica (1996) has also hypothesized that the disappearance of female babaylan during the late Spanish colonial period was probably the influence of the male-led Catholic church that \\"ousted\\" the female babaylan since the people were looking for parallels to the male clergy. Babaylan can freely marry and have children, including male asog who were recorded by early Spanish colonists as being married to men.Early colonial accounts point out that same- sex sexual relations were common for precolonial Filipinos of both sexes, not only the asog. In general, there was a great degree of sexual freedom in precolonial Filipino societies. Virginity was not valued, adultery was not perceived negatively, and there was wide use of genital piercings (tugbuk and sakra). (Brewer, 1999) In some ethnic groups, marriage was a prerequisite for gaining full shaman status. After the Spanish conquest of the Philippines, the practice of shamanism became clandestine due to persecution by the Catholic clergy. During this period, male shamans (particularly those specialized in the non-religious arts of herbalism and healing) became predominant. Female shamans became less common, while asog (shaman or otherwise) were punished harshly and driven to hiding. The change in women's status and the ostracization of the asog, however, did not immediately change the originally feminine role of the shamans. Male shamans in the late 17th century still dressed as women during rituals, even though they didn't do so in their day- to-day activities. Unlike the ancient asog, they did not have sexual relations with other men, and indeed, were usually married to women.  Roles  =Spirit mediums= Bontoc shaman performing a sacred wake ritual with a death chair. The primary role of shamans were as spirit mediums. They were intermediaries between the physical world and the spirit world, due to their ability to influence and interact with the spirits (anito), both malevolent and benevolent. There are two general types of spirits usually interacted with in s√©ance rituals. The first are the environmental or nature spirits \\"bound\\" to a particular location or natural phenomenon (similar to genii loci). They \\"own\\" places and concepts like agricultural fields, forests, cliffs, seas, winds, lightning, or realms in the spirit world. Some were also \\"keepers\\" or totems of various animals and plants. They have inhuman and abstract qualities, reflecting their particular dominions. They do not normally appear in human form and are usually gender-less or androgynous. They rarely concern themselves with human affairs. Rituals involving these spirits are almost always conducted outdoors. The second type of spirits are the \\"unbound\\" spirits that have an independent existence. They appear in animals (usually as birds) or human-like forms,Spirits in human form are believed to be distinguishable from humans because they do not have a philtrum. (Buenconsejo, 2002) have gender differentiation, and have personal names.Names of spirits are generally not spoken aloud outside of a shamanic ritual, as it is believed that it may provoke them. They are instead referred to in euphemistic terms like \\"dili ingon nato\\" or \\"hindi kagaya natin\\", literally meaning \\"those unlike us\\". (Buenconsejo, 2002; Tan, 2008) They are most similar to the fairies of European folklore.With strong parallels to human-like beings like elves and aos s√≠, as well as diminutive human-like beings like brownies and pixies. (Buenconsejo, 2002) These are the most common types of spirits to become abyan, as they are the most \\"sociable\\" and can take interest in human activities. These spirits are usually referred to as engkanto (from Spanish encanto) in modern Filipino folklore. Unlike the \\"bound\\" spirits, these spirits can be invited into human households, and their rituals can take place both outdoors and indoors. These categories are not static, however. A bound spirit can become unbound, and vice versa. Some shamans have spirit guides which are originally nature spirits that have become unbound. Not all shamanic rituals result in spirit possession. Unbound spirits always possess shamans during rituals. Either voluntarily or involuntarily. In contrast, bound spirits, as a rule, do not possess shamans. Instead, they are simply spoken to by the shaman. Bound spirits that inadvertently \\"stick\\" to humans are considered dangerous, and are the causes of spiritual illnesses, ranging from confusion, strange food cravings, lust, to unreasoning anger. Sometimes in order to speak to certain bound spirits, the shaman may need the intercession of their abyan, who in turn will possess the shaman. Bound spirits can also be interacted with by non-shamans, like when offering sacrifices to the spirit of the forest before a hunt. The Katalonas performed public ceremonies for community prosperity, fertility, or seasonable weather as well as private services to diagnose and cure ailments. They were respected for these functions but they were also feared sorcerers able to work black magic. Their numbers too were large enough to put them in competition with one another. Individual success was attributed to the power of the deities with whom they identified, and who took possession of them in their frenzied dancing. The Tagalog word ‚Äúolak‚Äù according to Ferdinand Blumentritt is a term for the trembling of the whole body of the catalona, when she becomes possessed by the devil (anito). As spirit mediums, they conducted s√©ances during which they spoke with the voice of spirits (anito), assisted by an \\"alagar\\" (\\"alagad\\", meaning personal attendant) to carry on the dialogue with the supernatural, or sent their own kaluluwa (soul) to seek lost souls. In this state of trance, the catalona was called ‚Äútarotaro‚Äù [literally meaning voices], for it was believed that the ancestral spirits had entered her body and were speaking from inside her. According to Blumentritt ‚Äútarotaro‚Äù is a tagalong term describing the katalonas while possessed by the spirits, in this state, they cried tarotaro. When a catalona held the gift of prophecy, she was named masidhi (the fervent one). =Healing= Healing was the most important role for shamans in their communities. Shamans distinguished between two kinds of illnesses, the natural (or non-spiritual) illnesses, and the spiritual illnesses. Natural illnesses do not require a shaman for healing, while spiritual illnesses do. Like in other Austronesian cultures, animistic Filipinos believed in the concept of soul dualism (sometimes referred to as \\"twin souls\\" or \\"double souls\\"). A person is believed to be composed of at least two souls‚Äîthe breath of life (ginhawa or hininga, which stays with the living body) and the astral soul (the kalag or kaluluwa, which can travel to the spirit world).Other names for the astral soul include kaluha, dungan (Visayan); kalag (Bicol); linnawa (Igorot), kaduwa (Isneg), ab-abiik (Kankanaey), karurua (Ilocano), ikaruruwa (Ibanag), karaduwa (Mangyan), kiyaraluwa (Tagbanwa), makatu (Bukidnon), and kadengan-dengan or gimokud (Manobo). (Scott, 1994; Tan, 2008; Mercado, 1991) Most of the terms for the astral soul literally translate to \\"twin\\" or \\"double\\", from PAN *duSa, \\"two\\". (Yu, 2000; Blust, 2010) The ginhawa is believed to reside in the pit of the stomach (usually the liver), while the kalag resides in the head. The ginhawa represents the person's body and bodily urges; while the kalag represents the person's identity, mind, and strength of will. Both are required in a living person. Natural illnesses are the result of damage to the ginhawa. While they do not require a shaman, they are still important, as the death of the ginhawa will also mean the death of the body. They can range from wounds, broken bones, poisoning, and snakebites. These can be treated by skilled shamans, but were more often relegated to apprentices or assistants specializing in healing or herbalism. Spiritual illnesses, on the other hand, are believed to be caused by the separation of the kalag from the ginhawa (referred to as \\"soul loss\\" in anthropological literature). This separation happens normally during sleep, where the kalag detaches to travel through the spirit world, resulting in dreams. However, when this separation happens when the person is awake, it results in spiritual illnesses. The causes of the separation can include the kalag getting lost in the spirit world; the kalag being captured, attacked, or seduced by another spirit; or simply the refusal of the kalag to return to the ginhawa. While it is not immediately lethal, the loss of the kalag can result in the loss of the person's mind and identity‚Äîthus insanity. Spiritual illnesses also include delirium, depression, trauma, fainting spells, and other mental illnesses. Evil or undesirable behavior may also be blamed on disharmony between the kalag and the ginhawa. Shamans may also perform rituals to heal and strengthen the kalag of a person. These include the ritual of batak dungan or batakan among Visayan shamans. It strengthens and empowers the kalag of a person to prepare them for challenges, problems and obstacles. This ritual also protects the person from possible spiritual attack caused by malevolent spirits and sorcery. Traditional massage Aside from rituals and herbal medicine, an ubiquitous traditional healing method done by shamans and healers is massage with oils (lana) known as hilot or haplos.Also aplos (Bontoc); aptus (Ivatan); unar (Kalinga); kemkem (Pangasinan); ilot or ilut (Ilocano, Itawis, Zambal, & Pampango); ablon (northern Ilocano); ilu (Ibanag); ilat (Isneg); elot (Ilonggo); agod or agud (Maranao & Maguindanao); and hagud (Lumad) It is still commonly practiced to this day. =Divination= The rotation of the Bakunawa in a calendar year, as explained in Mansueto Porras' Signosan (1919) Divination was closely tied to healing, as it was primarily used for diagnosing illnesses. It can be done by the shamans or by specialized apprentices with the necessary skill. Various paraphernalia and rituals are used to diagnose illnesses, examples include seashells, ginger, quartz or alum crystals (tawas), and chicken entrails. Diviners have names that indicate their preferred methods. For example, a diviner using alum crystals is known as a magtatawas, while a diviner that prefers to conduct a ritual known as luop is known as a mangluluop. Diviners are also able to foretell the future and perform geomancy rituals. A key mythological creature used in babaylan geomancy in the Visayas is the bakunawa (or naga), usually depicted as a gigantic serpent or dragon with a looped tail. The movements of the bakunawa affected the physical world, from the phases of the moon, to eclipses, the weather, floods, and earthquakes. The bakunawa was central to a sixteen-point compass rose. It faces a different cardinal direction every three months; facing north (aminhan), west (katungdan), south (bagatnan), and east (sidlangan) in a given twelve-month lunar year. The mouth of the bakunawa is believed to bring misfortune and evil, and various points in the compass all had different aspects depending on where the mouth was facing. These were consulted when making future plans like travel, trade, or marriage. When building houses, shamans were also often consulted to determine the most propitious placement of the foundations to avoid the ill luck brought by the bakunawa.Similar beliefs exist throughout Southeast Asia. These include the Cambodian nak, Burmese naga, and Thai naag. Though the cycles do not correspond exactly, all of them were used as a sort of geomantic calendar. =Sorcery= Some shamans were believed to be able to control the physical world through incantations, talismans, potions, or their spirit intermediaries.There are various names for sorcerers in Philippine ethnic groups, different from the term for \\"shaman\\". Most of these names have negative connotations, and thus is also translated to \\"witch\\" or \\"hag\\" in English sources. They include Bikol: parakaraw; Ilocano: managtanem, managinulod, mannamay; Ivatan: mamkaw, manulib; Kapampangan: mangkukusim (or mangkukusino); Pangasinan: manananem, mangngibawanen; Tagalog: mangkukulam (or mancocolam), mangagaway, may-galing, hukluban (or hukloban); Visayan: dalagangan, dunganon, dalongdongan, busalian, mamamarang (or mamalarang, barangan), usikan (or osikan), paktolan, sigbinan, manughiwit, mamumuyag, mang-aawog (or mang-aawug, mang-aaug). Healers are more strongly associated with sorcerers than mediums. In most cases, a healer is also a sorcerer. In order to cure or counteract sorcerous illnesses, healers must themselves know sorcery. This relationship is most apparent in Siquijor Island, where healer- sorcerers are still common. In some cultures like the Manobo people, shamans are entirely differentiated from sorcerers. Shamans deal with the spirit world and supernatural beings but do not have magical powers of their own; while sorcerers were regarded as human beings with powers gained from magical spells or objects. Illnesses believed to be caused by sorcery are treated differently from illnesses caused by spirits. The former are treated with counter-spells, simple antidotes, and physical healing; while the latter requires the intervention or dialogue with the spirits and thus a shaman ritual. In contrast, in Visayan societies, the most powerful shamans were sorcerers known as dalagangan (also dalongdongan or busalian). They could purportedly command the elements through magic spells and the strength of their kalag (or dungan) which was equated with \\"[spiritual] power\\".People with strong dungan are known as dunganon. They are described as being charismatic, very intelligent, confident, and strong-willed. They have a tendency to dominate others, and can do so without consciously being aware of it. They are natural leaders and are often respected ranking members of the community and thus tend to become sorcerers, shamans, chieftains, master craftsmen, or renowned warrior-heroes (known variously as bayani, bagani, or banwar in various Filipino ethnic groups). The concept of dungan is comparable to the term mana in Pacific Islander culture as well as similar \\"men of prowess\\" concepts in other Austronesian cultures. (Aguilar, 1998) Their alleged powers include conjuring fire or water, flight, shape-shifting, invisibility, invulnerability, and the ability to call down disasters. The dios-dios leaders of the Visayan peasant revolts in the late 19th century often claimed to possess these kinds of powers. A more common use of the power to command elements is rainmaking. A notable example was Estrella Bangotbanwa, a Karay-a ma-aram from southern Iloilo. According to local legend, she alleviated a three-year drought by performing a ritual that summoned a rainstorm. Sorcery was not restricted to shamans, but were also a common claim for leaders and warrior-heroes. In the pre-Islamic Maranao society depicted in the Darangen epic poem, heroes are born with \\"twin spirits\\" (tonong in Maranao) that grant them superhuman abilities. King Awilawil o Ndaw of the kingdom of Kaibat a Kadaan for example, has a tonong named Salindagaw Masingir that can take the aspect of typhoons, floods, and pillars of fire; while King Dalondong a Mimbantas of the kingdom of Gindolongan Marogong has a tonong named Mabokelod a Romba which took the form of a giant crocodile. Talismans and potions Numerous types of shamans use different kinds of items in their work, such as talismans or charms known as agimat or anting-anting, curse deflectors such as buntot pagi, and sacred oil concoctions, among many other objects. Black magic Sorcerers are also believed to have powers that cause harm to other people covertly. Healer-sorcerers who practice this kind of sorcery usually justify it as a form of criminal punishment, as a widespread belief is that black magic does not work on people who are innocent. Their targets are usually \\"wrongdoers\\" like thieves, adulterous spouses, or land grabbers. There are also \\"true\\" sorcerers who are said to have hereditary sorcerous powers. Unlike healers, they do not consider the justice of their actions. The latter type of sorcerers are often conflated with the evil supernatural beings capable of appearing human, like aswang and manananggal. The negative counterparts of the shamans are collectively called as witches, however, these witches actually include a variety of different kinds of people with differing occupations and cultural connotations which depend on the ethnic group they are associated with. They are completely different from the Western notion of what a witch is. Notable examples of witches in a Philippine concept are the mannamay, witches known to the Ibanag people, mangkukulam, witches that use materials from nature and the cursee as a form of curse, and the mambabarang, witches that utilize insects as a form of curse. Social status Babaylan were highly respected members of the community, on par with the pre-colonial noble class. In the absence of the datu (head of the community), the babaylan takes in the role of interim head of the community. Babaylans were powerful ritual specialists who were believed to have influence over the weather and tap various spirits in the natural and spiritual realms. Babaylans were held in such high regard as they were believed to possess powers that can block the dark magic of an evil datu or spirit and heal the sick or wounded. Among other powers of the babaylan were to ensure a safe pregnancy and child birth. As a spiritual medium, babaylans also lead rituals with offerings to the various divinities or deities. As an expert in divine and herb lore, incantations, and concoctions of remedies, antidotes, and a variety of potions from various roots, leaves, and seeds, the babaylans were also regarded as allies of certain datus in subjugating an enemy, hence, the babaylans were also known for their specialization in medical and divine combat. According to William Henry Scott (Barangay: Sixteenth-Century Philippines Culture and Society) a Katalonan could be of either sex, or male transvestites (bayoguin), but were usually women from prominent families who were wealthy in their own right. According to Luciano P. R. Santiago (To Love and to Suffer) as remuneration for their services they received a good part of the offerings of food, wine, clothing, and gold, the quality and quantity of which depended on the social status of the supplicant. Thus, the catalonas filled a very prestigious as well as lucrative role in society. Shamans of the many ethnicities in the Philippines always have another role in the community, aside from being spiritualists. Similar to the Shinto kannushi, among the jobs of the shaman range from being a merchant, warrior, farmer, fisherfolk, blacksmith, crafstfolk, weaver, potter, musician, and even as a barber or chef, depending on the preference of the shaman, skill of the shaman, and the need of the community. Some shamans have more than two occupations at a time, especially if a community lacks people with the needed skills to take upon the role of certain jobs. This tradition of having a second job (or more than two jobs) has been ingrained in certain cultural societies in the Philippines and is still practiced today by certain communities that have not been converted into Christianity. Specific communities that have been converted into Islam have also preserved this tradition through Muslim imams.Myths of the Philippines; Gaverza, J.K., 2014, University of the Philippines Diliman Their influence waned when most of the ethnic groups of the Philippines were converted to Islam and Catholicism. Under the Spanish Empire, babaylan were often maligned and falsely accused as witches and \\"priests of the devil\\" and were persecuted harshly by the Spanish clergy. The Spanish burned down everything they associated as connected to the native people's indigenous religion (including shrines such as the dambana), even forcefully ordering native children to defecate on their own god's idols, murdering those who disobey. In modern Philippine society, their roles have largely been taken over by folk healers, which are now predominantly male, while some are still being falsely accused as \\"witches\\". In areas where the people have not been converted into Muslims or Christians, notably ancestral domains of indigenous peoples, the shamans and their cultural traits have continued to exist with their respective communities, although these shamans and their practices are being slowly diluted by Abrahamic religions. Persecution, decline, and syncretization The Spanish colonization of the Philippines and the introduction of Catholic Christianity resulted in the extinction of most native shamanistic practices. Christianity was initially seen by native Filipinos as another type of anito. The Spanish missionaries exploited this misconception in their successful conversion and occupation of most of the islands with minimal military support. Spanish friars were seen as \\"shamans\\" whose souls and spirit guides were apparently more powerful than the native ones. They desecrated religious objects, sacred trees, and sacred areas with impunity, earning the awe of the natives. They could also cure various diseases that the native shamans could not. By the late 16th century, Christian symbols and paraphernalia (like rosaries, crucifixes, and holy water) became fetish objects, and Latin prayers and verses became part of the shaman's repertoire of magical chants and spells. Anito images (taotao) were replaced by Catholic idols and their rituals syncretized, including attributing anito-like powers to them like miraculous healing from touching them or an ability to possess people.Examples include the festivals of the Black Nazarene and the Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫ (McCoy, 1982) These flourished as they were tolerated by the Spanish clergy as \\"white magic\\". Nature spirits (diwata) during this period were also syncretized with the friars themselves, they became known as engkanto and began to be described as having European features with a propensity for deceiving, seducing, and playing tricks on people. The previously high status of the babaylan was lost. The role of women and the relative gender egalitarianism of Philippine animistic cultures, in general, became more subdued under the patriarchal culture of the Spanish. Most babaylan were stigmatized by the Catholic clergy as witches, satanists, or mentally unstable. The Spanish burned down everything they associated as connected to the native people's indigenous religions (including shrines such as the dambana), even forcefully ordering native children to defecate on their own god's idols. Performers depicting babaylans A few shamans, however, were assimilated by the church and syncretized their roles into mysticism in the Christian context, becoming faith healers and miracle workers. These include the beata movement in the 17th and 18th centuries, the messianic (and usually revolutionary) dios-dios movement of the late 19th century, and the espiritista (or spiritista) movement of the 20th century. However, their methods of worship remain basically the same. The faith healers are still in essence, mediums; but instead of channeling anito, they instead claim to channel saints, angels, or the Holy Spirit. Late-20th-century and 21st-century faith healers also frequently use western esoteric and pseudoscientific terminology and practices (like \\"psychic energy\\" and psychic surgery), with little connection to traditional shamanic religions. An account of the conversion of Katalonas was provided by a Spanish priest named Pedro Chirino (1604), he narrated that a blind catalona named Diego Magsanga who along with his wife (who was said to be a skilled midwife) converted to Christianity. After he was baptized in the name Diego he became a faithful assistant of the friars in expanding Christianity in Silang, Cavite. This former catalona contributed a lot in teaching children and adults catechism (Doctrina Christiana). Chirino also reported that a lot of people followed this former catalona and the Jesuits can't even surpassed him when it comes to the teachings of the Church and the diligence of teaching his brethren, although he was not a priest, the likely role the Spanish priest gave him in the church is that of a laity or hermano. Chirino also mentioned another male catalona who together with a group of catalonas he was leading was convinced by a Jesuit priest Francisco Almerique to be converted to Christianity. Chirino noted that this catalona wore his hair long (which is unusual for Tagalog men) and he braids it to signify his priesthood. Before he was baptized, in front of people, he cut his hair as a sign that the power of the anito has been broken. Others abandoned the animistic aspects of shamanism and became folk healers (arbularyo),Derived from Spanish herbolario (\\"herbalist\\"). These generalist healers were also known by the Spanish as mediquillos, saludadores, or curanderos (Marco, 2001) midwives, and practitioners of traditional hilot massage therapy with oils. These modern versions of babaylan are now usually male (except midwives). They are usually sought out in minor ailments and in illnesses that modern medicine can not diagnose or cure. Like in ancient babaylan, modern babaylan distinguish between \\"spiritual diseases\\" and \\"natural diseases\\", the latter they will usually refer to a medical doctor. Similarly, among Muslim Filipinos, shamans, usually male, are now relegated to folk healing and in dealing with \\"indigenous\\" spirits. All other aspects of the religious life of Muslim Filipinos have been taken over by Islamic religious leaders. A direct equivalent of the Christian Filipino \\"faith healers\\" and albolaryo are Islamized shamans known as pandita or guru. They follow Islam but also provide traditional healing practices and cultural rituals retained from their shamanistic past. They usually perform minor rites like aqiqah (cutting the hair of the firstborn) and ruqqiya (exorcism). A version of the traditional massage therapy conducted by folk healers also exist, known as agud or agod among the Maranao and Maguindanao people. The most strongly affected by this religious shift to Abrahamic religions were the feminized male asog shamans. During the 17th to 18th centuries, Spanish administrators in the Philippines burned people convicted of homosexual relations at the stake and confiscated their possessions, in accordance to a decree by the president of the Real Audiencia, Pedro Hurtado Desquibel. Several instances of such punishments were recorded by the Spanish priest Juan Francisco de San Antonio in his Chronicas de la Apostolica Provincia de San Gregorio (1738‚Äì1744). Feminized men were also persecuted harshly in the (then recently) Islamized ethnic groups in Mindanao. In Historia de las Islas de Mindanao, Iolo, y sus adyacentes (1667), the Spanish priest Francisco Comb√©s records that their \\"unnatural crime\\" was punished by the Muslim peoples in Mindanao with death by burning or drowning, and that their houses and property were also burned as they believed that it was contagious.  Resistance against colonial rule A few followers of the native shamanism resisted Spanish rule and conversion, especially in areas difficult to reach for Spanish missionaries, like the highlands of Luzon and the interiors of Mindanao. In Spanish-controlled areas (especially in the Visayas), entire villages would defy the policies of reducci√≥nes (resettlement) and move deeper into the island interiors at the instigation of their babaylan. Shamanistic rituals also continued to be performed secretly in some areas, though these were punished by the Spanish clergy when discovered. Open revolts led by shamans were common during Spanish rule. Aside from the early revolts in the 17th century, most of these were led by religious leaders who practiced Folk Catholicism rather than true shamanism. =17th century= The first recorded armed revolt led by a babaylan was the Tamblot uprising of Bohol in 1621‚Äì1622. It was led by a male shaman named Tamblot who saw the spread of Catholicism as a threat. He rallied around two thousand followers in an effort to \\"return to the old ways\\", but his rebellion was crushed by the Spanish authorities with the help of converted native auxiliaries. Tamblot's revolt inspired another rebellion in neighboring Carigara, Leyte in the same time period. The Bankaw revolt was led by a datu named Bankaw and his son Pagali who was a babaylan. Bankaw's rebellion was notable as Bankaw was one of the first converts to Catholicism in the Philippines. As a young man, he had formerly welcomed the conquistador Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi in 1565 when their expedition first landed on the islands. Like Tamblot, Bankaw and Pagali both wanted a return to the old ways. Bankaw renounced his Catholic faith and built a temple to a diwata. Their rebellion was defeated by the Spanish Governor- general Alonso Fajardo de Entenza. Bankaw was beheaded, while Pagali and eighty-one other babaylan were burned at the stake. The Tapar rebellion was an uprising in Iloilo, Panay led by a babaylan named Tapar in 1663. Tapar syncretized native shamanism with Catholic terminology and declared himself \\"God Almighty\\" of a new religion. He also emulated the ancient asog by dressing up in women's clothing. He and his followers killed a Spanish priest and burned the town church before escaping to the mountains. Tapar and other leaders of his movement were captured and executed by Spanish and Filipino soldiers. =18th century= A religious uprising in 1785 in Ituy (modern Aritao), Nueva Vizcaya was led by a healer named Lagutao. He claimed that an outbreak of smallpox in northern Luzon was a result of the natives abandoning their ancestral beliefs. It was suppressed by neighboring Christian townsmen led by Dominican friars. =19th century= The 19th century saw the rise of the dios-dios \\"shamans\\". Dios-dios (literally \\"god pretender\\" or \\"false god\\", from Spanish dios) were religious leaders so named because of their penchant for identifying themselves with Christian religious figures. They led cult- like religious movements, promising prosperity, supernatural powers, or healing to their followers. Most were mere charlatans selling amulets and magical pieces of paper. Their members were mostly from the illiterate rural poor who had little knowledge of formal Catholic teachings and were living in extreme poverty under colonial rule. Papa Isio with two babaylanes followers in a prison in Bacolod after his surrender to American authorities in 1907. Note his \\"Papal vestments\\" and the woman's dress worn by the man to his left. There are numerous examples of dios-dios leaders in the 19th century. They include Lungao, a healer from Ilocos who claimed he was Jesus Christ in 1811; Ignacio Dimas, who led the \\"Tres Cristos\\" (\\"Three Christs\\") of Libmanan, Nueva C√°ceres (modern Camarines Sur) who claimed they had supernatural powers over diseases in 1865; Benedicta, an old woman and a healer who called herself \\"La Santa de Leyte\\" (\\"The Saint of Leyte\\") in 1862 and prophesied that the island of Leyte would sink; Clara Tarrosa, an eighty-year-old babaylan in Tigbauan, Iloilo in the late 1880s who proclaimed herself the Virgin Mary and isolated herself and her followers from Spanish rule; Francisco Gonzalez (alias \\"Francisco Sales\\" or \\"Fruto Sales\\") of Jaro, Leyte who claimed in 1888 that he was a king sent to save people from another great flood by leading them to a city that would rise from the waves; and many more. These movements were usually suppressed by the Spanish by imprisoning their leaders or exiling them. The dios-dios movement was initially purely religious, only reacting defensively to Spanish persecution. However, by the 1880s, some dios-dios groups became more violently anti-colonial. The first such group was the one led by Ponciano Elofre, a cabeza de barangay of a sitio of Zamboanguita, Negros Oriental. He took the name \\"Dios Buhawi\\" (\\"Whirlwind God\\") and proclaimed himself the savior of the people. He declared that they would stop paying taxes to the Spanish government. He formed a community of around two thousand followers (whom the Spanish authorities called the babaylanes) and would regularly attack Spanish-controlled towns. Emulating the ancient asog shamans, he dressed in women's clothing and assumed feminine mannerisms even though he was married to a woman. He claimed supernatural powers much like the ancient dalagangan. He was killed while attacking the town of Siaton in 1887. His wife and relatives attempted to continue the movement, but they were eventually captured and exiled by Spanish authorities. The remnants of the group either descended to banditry or joined other later dios-dios movements. Another dios-dios uprising was led by a shaman named Gregorio Lampinio (better known as \\"Gregorio Dios\\", and also known as \\"Hilario Pablo\\" or \\"Papa\\") in Antique from 1888. The uprising was formed near Mount Balabago, a sacred pilgrimage site for shamans. Lampinio led a force of around 400 people. They collected contribuciones babaylanes (a revolutionary tax), disseminated anti- colonial ideas, and launched attacks on towns in Antique and Iloilo. The group was eventually suppressed by the Guardia Civil by 1890. The last significant dios-dios rebellion in the 19th century was led by Dionisio Magbuelas, better known as Papa Isio (\\"Pope Isio\\"). He was a former member of the Dios Buhawi group. He organized his own babaylanes group from remnants of Elofre's followers and led an uprising in Negros Occidental in 1896 against Spanish rule. After the Philippines was ceded to the United States after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he was initially made \\"military chief\\" of La Castellana, Negros Occidental under the American government. However, he picked up armed resistance again in 1899 in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. He surrendered on August 6, 1907 to American authorities and was sentenced to death. This was later commuted to life imprisonment and he died in the Manila Bilibid Prison in 1911. =20th century= Concurrent with Papa Isio's rebellion in Negros Occidental against American rule, the dios-dios movement in eastern Visayas turned their attention to the new American colonial government. Calling themselves the Pulajanes (\\"those who wear red\\"), they were led by Faustino Ablen (\\"Papa Faustino\\") in Leyte; and Pablo Bulan (\\"Papa Pablo\\"), Antonio Anugar, and Pedro de la Cruz in Samar. Like their predecessors, they claimed supernatural powers and used fetishistic amulets, holy oils, and magic spells in battle. They attacked both American troops and local Filipinos cooperating with the American colonial government. The last Pulajanes leader was killed in 1911.

It is usually remembered for paranormal shows such as 'Psychic Livetime'Psychic Livetime and 'Predictions With Derek Acorah';Predictions these programmes have not been shown on TV since Breeze's closure. The channel was initially split into four segments: Granada Food & Wine, Granada Health & Beauty, Granada TV High Street and Granada Home & Garden. These were abolished at the time of rebranding to Granada Breeze. On ITV Digital the channel shared time with Men & Motors, but when Breeze closed, a testcard was shown in its slot and was not replaced. Its closure was put down to cost, capacity and poor ratings. The decision to buy programmes rather than make them lost them most of their regular viewers. The channel failed to capitalise on the increasing popularity of its paranormal shows and stopped making them along with all their other shows in 2001. Two Granada Breeze regulars, Yvette Fielding and Derek Acorah, went on to feature in the popular paranormal TV show Most Haunted on Living TV.

It was one of the largest English bus companies, operating over a large area between Gloucester in the south and Derbyshire in the north, and from Northampton to the Welsh border. The company also manufactured buses. History Preserved BMMO S16 Preserved BMMO S23 Preserved BMMO C5 Preserved BMMO CM6 Preserved BMMO D9 Preserved Leyland National with Chaserider branding = Origins = In 1899 the British Electric Traction (BET) company acquired the assets of the Birmingham General Omnibus Company, which had been formed three years earlier to acquire a number of horse bus operations in Birmingham. When BET ordered new buses for Birmingham the next year, they were painted red to make them stand out. In 1902 BET acquired the City of Birmingham Tramways Company, which operated horse buses as well as trams.Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Company (Midland Red) Made in Birmingham The Birmingham & Midland Motor Omnibus Company was formed by local businessmen in November 1904 to operate motor bus services in Birmingham. When the directors failed to attract sufficient investors, BET acquired control of the new company, and in 1905 transferred its local horse bus operations to it. The company also acquired a motor bus company which had started in 1903. BMMO started operations under its own name in July 1905. However, the company experienced problems with its motor buses, and in 1907 reverted all its motor bus services to horse bus operation.Sixty Years of Midland Red Commercial Motor 27 November 1964 In 1912 the company purchased some Tilling-Stevens petrol-electric buses. Further motor buses followed, and by June 1913 only 17 horse buses remained. The company adopted for its motor buses the red livery used by Birmingham General, and the buses carried the fleetname \\"Midland\\". They soon acquired the nickname Midland Red. =Expansion outside Birmingham= By 1912 the Birmingham Corporation Tramways had used its statutory powers to acquire the city's tramways which it did not already own, and wanted to consolidate the operation of bus and tram operations in the city. Since it was going to be difficult for BMMO to expand in the city, it reached agreement with the corporation to operate services from outside Birmingham into the city and transfer its services within the city to the corporation. The company then expanded outside Birmingham, and moved its headquarters to Bearwood in Smethwick. During World War I, the company took over BET operations in Worcester and elsewhere, and after the war opened depots in Walsall, Coventry, Wolverhampton, Hereford, Stafford, Banbury, Bromsgrove, Shrewsbury, Nuneaton, Leamington Spa and Leicester. During the 1920s the tramways owned by BET in the Black Country were gradually replaced by Midland Red buses. In 1930, the Great Western Railway and the London Midland & Scottish Railway together acquired 50% of the company. The few GWR bus services in the area were transferred to Midland Red. =Coach services= Midland Red started express coach services in 1921 with routes to Weston-super-Mare and Llandudno. Coach services expanded, and in 1934 Midland Red became a founder member of the Associated Motorways consortium. Coach services were heavily reduced during World War II, but expanded again after the war. When the M1 motorway opened in 1959, Midland Red started non-stop express services between Birmingham and London, and later between Coventry and London.Midland Red Get Motorway Services Commercial Motor 27 March 1959Coventry-London services along M1 Commercial Motor 9 September 1960 For the service, the company developed Britain's first high-speed motor- coach. A fleet of ten, capable of speeds of up to , were built at the company's workshops at Edgbaston. The opening of the M5 motorway enabled the operation of express services between Birmingham and Worcester. = Nationalisation = When the railways were nationalised forming in 1947 under the Transport Act 1947, Midland Red became 50% state-owned. In 1968, BET sold its UK bus interests to the government, and on 1 January 1969 the company became the largest subsidiary of the National Bus Company (NBC). The livery was later changed from a deep red to the NBC corporate poppy red. In 1973 the garages (with the exception of Digbeth Coach Station, Bearwood and Cradley Heath) and routes within the West Midlands county were transferred to the control of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority, leaving Midland Red with country and local routes mainly in Derbyshire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire and express services.PTA to get Red services Commercial Motor 1 December 1972 =Rebranding= From 1977 onwards, after extensive passenger research the company was rebranded into local area names under the Viable Network Project, something that was soon renamed as the Market Analysis Project and widely adopted throughout NBC and elsewhere in the bus industry.

Tilling-Stevens became the main supplier of bus chassis to the company which, under its Chief Engineer LG Wyndham Shire, adapted and developed the designs to its own requirements, finally designing a vehicle it intended to construct itself. Between 1923 and 1969, the BMMO built most of the buses it operated: up to 1940 these were called SOS (rumoured to stand for Superior Omnibus Specification), and some models were supplied to other bus companies associated within the British Electric Traction (BET) group, namely Trent, PMT and Northern General. After 1940, the vehicles were identified by the company's initials, BMMO, and supplied solely for the BMMO company's own use. Codes later used for buses were FEDD (Front Entrance Double Decker), REDD (Rear Entrance Double Decker), Coaches were initially classified \\"ONC\\", but later used a prefix of \\"C\\" ‚Äì or \\"CM\\" for Motorway coaches. Single Decker models after the war were numbered S6, then S8 through S23, Double Decker models D1 through D10. The D10 was, in some opinions, the pinnacle of BMMO bus design ‚Äì a double decker with front entrance/rear exit and an underfloor engine, but only two were produced. AD2, GD6 and LD8 were exceptions to the normal designation system ‚Äì these codes referred to batches of respectively AEC, Guy and Leyland vehicles acquired when the manufacturing operation could not meet the heavy demand. Individual buses were numbered from (around) 2000 to 5900 ‚Äì registrations (usually) incorporated the last three numbers of the serial, and a letter prefix of three letters ending in \\"HA\\" ( a Smethwick origin registration mark). This relationship did not apply to the limited number of buses gained as a result of acquisition of other operators. Bus manufacture, overhaul and accident repair was carried out at Carlyle Works, adjacent to the Rotton Park Reservoir in Edgbaston, Birmingham. Nearby to the works was BMMO's head office, in Vernon Road, Edgbaston.

Background 1871 was the first general election to include the four MƒÅori electorates, with elections held on 1 and 15 February. The first MƒÅori Members of Parliament had been elected in 1868, but in 1871 three retired and one (Western Maori) was defeated. So in 1871 four new MƒÅori MPs were elected. In 1866 the secret ballot was introduced for general (European) elections. The 1871 general election was the first one at which it was used. The secret ballot not used in MƒÅori electorates until 1938, thus MƒÅori voters continued to inform a polling officer orally of their chosen candidate. The date of election is defined here as the day on which the poll took place, or if there was no contest, the day of nomination. The earliest election day was 14 January 1871. The earliest date in the general electorate results table, 13 January 1871, thus represents William Rolleston being declared elected unopposed in the Avon electorate on nomination day. The last election was held on 23 February 1871 in the Franklin electorate. 68 European electorates and 4 MƒÅori electorates were defined by the Representation Act 1870.

The MƒÅori vote was held on 4 and 15 January 1876. A total of 56,471 voters were registered. Background Political parties had not been established yet; this only happened after the 1890 election. The previous parliament had 78 representatives from 72 electorates. In October 1875, Parliament passed the Representation Act 1875, and resolved to increase the size of Parliament to 88 representatives through the following changes: * one additional member for City of Dunedin (from two to three) * the single member electorates of Christchurch East and Christchurch West to amalgamate and form the City of Christchurch electorate with three members * one additional member for Timaru ( was formed as a new electorate) * one additional member for Waitaki (from one to two) * one additional member for Grey Valley (from one to two) * one additional member for (from one to two) * one additional member for (from one to two) * one additional member for Wanganui (from one to two) * one additional member for (from one to two) * a new electorate (with one member) With the two new electorates and the amalgamation in Christchurch, the number of electorates thus increased by one to 73. Eleven of the electorates were two-member electorates; two electorates were three-member electorates. To split Timaru into two electorates was proposed by the Timaru incumbent, Edward Stafford. The new electorate for the Waikato, Waipa, was added on the proposal put forward by William Jackson, who retired at the end of the parliamentary term in 1875. Sir George Grey, 1885 The election was held over six weeks in December 1875 and January 1876. The date of election is defined here as the day on which the poll took place, or if there was no contest, the day of nomination. The first elections were held on 20 December 1875 in the City of Dunedin and City of Nelson electorates, returning a total of five members. In Dunedin, the three positions were contested by eight candidates. In Nelson, 20 December was the nomination day and the two candidates were returned unopposed. In two electorates, elections were held on Christmas Eve, while 19 candidates were elected between Christmas and New Year. The last election was held in the electorate on 29 January 1876 between Arthur Seymour and George Henderson. Seymour was successful. Elections in the Maori electorates were held on 4 January Southern Maori and 15 January (all other Maori electorates). A total of 56,471 voters were registered. George Grey stood in the general election for both the Auckland West and the Thames electorates. In the two- member Auckland electorate, only Grey and Patrick Dignan were put forward as candidates, and were thus declared elected on 22 December 1875. The two-member Thames electorate was contested by six candidates, including Julius Vogel (who was Premier in 1875), William Rowe and Charles Featherstone Mitchell. On election day (6 January 1876), Grey attracted the highest number of votes and, unexpectedly, Rowe beat Vogel into second place (Vogel also stood in Wanganui, where he was returned). Hence Grey and Rowe were declared elected for Thames. A protest against Grey's election was lodged with the returning officer the following day, stating that Grey had not been eligible to stand in Thames as he had already been elected in Auckland West. This petition was filed to the House of Representatives at the end of January. With this controversy going on for several months unresolved, Grey advised in mid June 1876 in a series of telegrams that he had chosen to represent Auckland West. On 8 July, the report of the committee inquiring into his election for Thames was read to the House. It was found that this was in accordance with the law, but that he had to make a decision for which electorate he would sit. On 15 July 1876, Grey announced that he would represent Thames, and he moved that a by-election be held in Auckland West for the seat that he would vacate there. The Government received a majority over the opposition in the election, but with political parties not forming until 1890, precise numbers cannot be given. One newspaper counted 48 of the members as Government supporters. On 15 February 1876, the Pollen Ministry led by Daniel Pollen resigned. Julius Vogel, who had been Premier prior to Pollen, formed a new ministry and became Premier again.

Background Formal political parties had not been established yet; this only happened after the 1890 election. The same 73 electorates were used as for the last election, which was held in 1875‚Äì76. In October 1875, Parliament passed the Representation Act 1875, which resolved to increase the size of Parliament to 88 representatives across the 73 electorates. Two of the electorates were represented by three members each ( and ). A further eleven electorates were represented by two members each (Auckland West, , Grey Valley, , , City of Nelson, , , , Wanganui and City of Wellington). The remaining 60 electorates were represented by a single member each. The election came about when George Grey's government was defeated in a no-confidence motion in July. He successfully requested a dissolution from the Governor of New Zealand, Sir Hercules Robinson. Male MƒÅori received universal suffrage (two years before European males were granted universal suffrage). The parliamentary term was reduced from five to three years. Date The election was held between 28 August and 15 September. The date of election is defined here as the day on which the poll took place, or if there was no contest, the day of nomination. The earliest date was the nomination meeting in the electorate, where William Rolleston was declared elected unopposed.

The election in the Maori electorates were held on 8 September. Candidates At the nomination meeting in the electorate on 5 September 1879, Joseph Shephard, Albert Pitt, Oswald Curtis and Acton Adams were proposed, the latter three without their knowledge or consent, presumably by opponents of George Grey who had the support of Shephard. With Pitt, Curtis and Adams all formally withdrawing from the contest, the returning officer declared Shephard elected unopposed. In 14 seats there was only one candidate.Wilson (1985) page 285 Result In the European electorates, the male population over 21 years of age was 116,008. Of those, 82,271 were enrolled and the turnout was 66.5%. The male MƒÅori population was estimated at 14,553, of which 6,686 voted (turnout 46%). The Maori statistics are to be treated with caution, though, as not much emphasis was put into precise data gathering. When the first Maori roll was established for the , for example, more votes were cast than were voters on the roll. The initial results showed a virtual deadlock with no clear winner. Inititially the opposition seemed to have won slightly more seats than the \\"Greyites\\" (supporters of Grey) but not enough to claim a majority outright. However, after several days of negotiations a new ministry was formed by John Hall who had ensured support from 45 members, with 41 backing Grey and 2 Independent of either faction. Upon Grey's rejection, James Macandrew was unanimously elected leader of the liberals and sought to oust Hall and form a new ministry, but was denied after Hall induced four Auckland liberals (known as the \\"Auckland rats\\") to cross the floor. George Grey was elected in both the Thames and the City of Christchurch electorates. Grey came first in the three-member Christchurch electorate (Samuel Paull Andrews and Edward Stevens came second with equal numbers of votes, and only 23 votes ahead of Edward Richardson). Richardson petitioned against Grey's return on technical grounds, as Grey had already been elected in the Thames electorate. The electoral commission unseated Grey on 24 October, with Richardson offered to fill this vacancy a few days later. Grey kept the Thames seat and remained a member of parliament through that constituency. Laws were passed to confirm the results in three electorates where there was some doubt about the legitimacy of the results to confirm the winner (1879; the electorates were , and ); and to clarify the law about electoral petitions (1880): Government formation Following the election, John Hall formed a new government on 8 October 1879, and Hall thus became the 12th Premier of New Zealand. The Hall Ministry stayed in power until 21 April 1882, i.e. some months after the next general election.

In 5 seats there was only one candidate. 1887 electoral redistribution The Representation Act 1887 had major implication for the procedure of revising electoral boundaries. The revision task was transferred from committees formed by MPs to a permanent Representation Commission. The act specified that a country quota of 18% be applied to all designated districts that excluded boroughs with a population above 2,000 people, and that all electorates were to have the same nominal population within a tolerance of 750 people. It was also stipulated that electoral boundaries were to be reviewed after each New Zealand census. In the 1887 electoral redistribution, although the Representation Commission was required through the Representation Act 1887 to maintain existing electorates \\"as far as possible\\", rapid population growth in the North Island required the transfer of three seats from the South Island to the north. Ten new electorates were created: , , , , , , , , , and .

Only 34 returned members supported the government, whilst 52 opposition MPs were elected as well as nine independents. This led to much confusion in Wellington in September 1887 when the members gathered to form a government. John Bryce, William Rolleston and Robert Stout had all lost their seats. Sir John Hall said he was too old. Sir Julius Vogel's policies had been rejected by the voters. So there was no alternative to Harry Atkinson, and after two weeks of negotiations he announced a ministry on 11 October. Only two ministers had served with him before. The Scarecrow Ministry was not expected to last, but did. The years 1887 and 1888 were the worst of the Long Depression, and Atkinson cut salaries, raised loans and raised customs duties. He was not popular with the wealthy, but they feared the Opposition leaders Grey and Ballance even more. By 1890 Atkinson was too ill to make speeches in the House.

The honey badger's reverse countershading makes it conspicuous, honestly signalling its ability to defend itself through its aggressive temperament, and its sharp teeth and claws. Aposematism is the advertising by an animal to potential predators that it is not worth attacking or eating. This unprofitability may consist of any defences which make the prey difficult to kill and eat, such as toxicity, venom, foul taste or smell, sharp spines, or aggressive nature. Aposematism always involves advertising signals, which may take the form of conspicuous coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic signals are beneficial for both predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm. The term was coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration. Aposematism is exploited in M√ºllerian mimicry, where species with strong defences evolve to resemble one another. By mimicking similarly coloured species, the warning signal to predators is shared, causing them to learn more quickly at less of a cost to each of the species. A genuine aposematic signal that a species actually possesses chemical or physical defences is not the only way to deter predators. In Batesian mimicry, a mimicking species resembles an aposematic model closely enough to share the protection, while many species have bluffing deimatic displays which may startle a predator long enough to enable an otherwise undefended prey to escape. Etymology The term aposematism was coined by the English zoologist Edward Bagnall Poulton in his 1890 book The Colours of Animals. He based the term on the Ancient Greek words ·ºÄœÄœå apo \\"away\\" and œÉ·øÜŒºŒ± sƒìma \\"sign\\", referring to signs that warn other animals away.  Defence mechanism  Flamboyant cuttlefish colours warn of toxicity 184x184px The function of aposematism is to prevent attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high- contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. This is in contrast to deimatic displays, which attempt to startle a predator with a threatening appearance but which are bluffing, unsupported by any strong defences. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white. These colours provide strong contrast with green foliage, resist changes in shadow and lighting, are highly chromatic, and provide distance dependent camouflage. Some forms of warning coloration provide this distance dependent camouflage by having an effective pattern and colour combination that do not allow for easy detection by a predator from a distance, but are warning-like from a close proximity, allowing for an advantageous balance between camouflage and aposematism. Warning coloration evolves in response to background, light conditions, and predator vision. Visible signals may be accompanied by odours, sounds or behaviour to provide a multi-modal signal which is more effectively detected by predators. Hycleus lugens, an aposematically coloured beetle Unpalatability, broadly understood, can be created in a variety of ways. Some insects such as the ladybird or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk produces a noxious odour, and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, the sting of a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats to avoid them, or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colours and produce audible noises when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself, as for example in honey badgers. Prevalence =In terrestrial ecosystems= Skunk, Mephitis mephitis, advertising its powerful defences, scent glands near the tail, by raising its tail and displaying its warning coloration Aposematism is widespread in insects, but less so in vertebrates, being mostly confined to a smaller number of reptile, amphibian, and fish species, and some foul-smelling or aggressive mammals. Pitohuis, red and black birds whose toxic feathers and skin apparently comes from the poisonous beetles they ingest, could be included. It has been recently proposed that aposematism played a significant role in human evolution.Joseph Jordania A New Model of Human Evolution: How Predators Shaped Human Morphology and Behavior. Lambert Academic Publishers, 2017 Perhaps the most numerous aposematic vertebrates are the poison dart frogs (family: Dendrobatidae). These neotropical anuran amphibians exhibit a wide spectrum of coloration and toxicity. Some species in this poison frog family (particularly Dendrobates, Epipedobates, and Phyllobates) are conspicuously coloured and sequester one of the most toxic alkaloids among all living species. Within the same family, there are also cryptic frogs (such as Colostethus and Mannophryne) that lack these toxic alkaloids. Although these frogs display an extensive array of coloration and toxicity, there is very little genetic difference between the species. Evolution of their conspicuous coloration is correlated to traits such as chemical defense, dietary specialization, acoustic diversification, and increased body mass. Some plants are thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of unpalatable chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns.Rubino, Darrin L.; McCarthy, Brian C. \\"Presence of Aposematic (Warning) Coloration in Vascular Plants of Southeastern Ohio\\" Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society, Vol. 131, No. 3 (Jul-Sep 2004), pp. 252-256. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4126955 Many insects, such as cinnabar moth caterpillars, acquire toxic chemicals from their host plants.Edmunds, 1974. pp. 199‚Äì201. Among mammals, skunks and zorillas advertise their foul-smelling chemical defences with sharply contrasting black-and-white patterns on their fur, while the similarly-patterned badger and honey badger advertise their sharp claws, powerful jaws, and aggressive natures. Some brightly coloured birds such as passerines with contrasting patterns may also be aposematic, at least in females; but since male birds are often brightly coloured through sexual selection, and their coloration is not correlated with edibility, it is unclear whether aposematism is significant. There is evidence that nudibranchs like Phyllidia varicosa are aposematic. =In marine ecosystems= Conspicuous colours of crown-of-thorns starfish spines may warn of strong toxins within. The existence of aposematism in marine ecosystems is controversial. Many marine organisms, particularly those on coral reefs, are brightly coloured or patterned, including sponges, corals, molluscs and fishes, with little or no connection to chemical or physical defenses. Caribbean reef sponges are brightly coloured, and many species are full of toxic chemicals, but there is no relationship between the two factors. Nudibranch molluscs are the most commonly cited examples of aposematism in marine ecosystems, but the evidence for this has been contested, mostly because (1) there are few examples of mimicry among species, (2) many species are nocturnal or cryptic, and (3) bright colours at the red end of the colour spectrum are rapidly attenuated as a function of water depth. For example, the Spanish Dancer nudibranch (genus Hexabranchus), among the largest of tropical marine slugs, potently chemically defended, and brilliantly red and white, is nocturnal and has no known mimics. Mimicry is to be expected as Batesian mimics with weak defences can gain a measure of protection from their resemblance to aposematic species. Other studies have concluded that nudibranchs such as the slugs of the family Phyllidiidae from Indo-Pacific coral reefs are aposematically coloured. M√ºllerian mimicry has been implicated in the coloration of some Mediterranean nudibranchs, all of which derive defensive chemicals from their sponge diet. The crown-of-thorns starfish, like other starfish such as Metrodira subulata, has conspicuous coloration and conspicuous long, sharp spines, as well as cytolytic saponins, chemicals which could function as an effective defence; this evidence is argued to be sufficient for such species to be considered aposematic. It has been proposed that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, there is evidence that fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective. Hapalochlaena lunulata are considered by some to be aposematic. Blue-ringed octopuses are venomous. They spend much of their time hiding in crevices whilst displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal chromatophore cells. However, if they are provoked, they quickly change colour, becoming bright yellow with each of the 50-60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second. It is often stated this is an aposematic warning display, but the hypothesis has rarely if ever been tested. Behaviour The mechanism of defence relies on the memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off. Aposematic species do not need to hide or stay still as cryptic organisms do, so aposematic individuals benefit from more freedom in exposed areas and can spend more time foraging, allowing them to find more and better quality food. They may also be able to make use of conspicuous mating displays, including vocal signals, which may then develop through sexual selection. Origins of the theory Gregarious nymphs of an aposematic milkweed bug, Lygaeus kalmii =Wallace, 1867= In a letter to Alfred Russel Wallace dated 23 February 1867 Charles Darwin wrote \\"On Monday evening I called on Bates & put a difficulty before him, which he could not answer, & as on some former similar occasion, his first suggestion was, 'you had better ask Wallace'. My difficulty is, why are caterpillars sometimes so beautifully & artistically coloured?\\" Darwin was puzzled because his theory of sexual selection (where females choose their mates based on how attractive they are) could not apply to caterpillars since they are immature and hence not sexually active. Wallace replied the next day with the suggestion that since some caterpillars \\"...are protected by a disagreeable taste or odour, it would be a positive advantage to them never to be mistaken for any of the palatable catterpillars [sic], because a slight wound such as would be caused by a peck of a bird‚Äôs bill almost always I believe kills a growing . Any gaudy & conspicuous colour therefore, that would plainly distinguish them from the brown & green eatable , would enable _birds_ to recognise them easily as ~~at~~ a kind not fit for food, & thus they would escape _seizure_ which is as bad as being _eaten_.\\" Since Darwin was enthusiastic about the idea, Wallace asked the Entomological Society of London to test the hypothesis. In response, the entomologist John Jenner Weir conducted experiments with caterpillars and birds in his aviary, and in 1869 he provided the first experimental evidence for warning coloration in animals. The evolution of aposematism surprised 19th-century naturalists because the probability of its establishment in a population was presumed to be low, since a conspicuous signal suggested a higher chance of predation. =Poulton, 1890= First edition of Edward Bagnall Poulton's The Colours of Animals, 1890, introduced a set of new terms for animal coloration including \\"aposematic\\". Wallace coined the term \\"warning colours\\" in an article about animal coloration in 1877. In 1890 Edward Bagnall Poulton renamed the concept aposematism in his book The Colours of Animals. He described the derivation of the term as follows: Evolution Aposematism is paradoxical in evolutionary terms, as it makes individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it. If warning coloration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage, it would never last in the species long enough to become beneficial. =Supported explanations= There is evidence for explanations involving dietary conservatism, in which predators avoid new prey because it is an unknown quantity; this is a long-lasting effect. Dietary conservatism has been demonstrated experimentally in some species of birds and fish. Further, birds recall and avoid objects that are both conspicuous and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning coloration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works at least in part by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning. All of these results contradict the idea that novel, brightly coloured individuals would be more likely to be eaten or attacked by predators. =Alternative hypotheses= Other explanations are possible. Predators might innately fear unfamiliar forms (neophobia) long enough for them to become established, but this is likely to be only temporary. Alternatively, prey animals might be sufficiently gregarious to form clusters tight enough to enhance the warning signal. If the species was already unpalatable, predators might learn to avoid the cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious. Another possibility is that a gene for aposematism might be recessive and located on the X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species. A further explanation is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection is strong enough to allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait. Once aposematic individuals reach a certain threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be spread out over a larger number of individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning coloration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection. A theory for the evolution of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features. Mimicry Aposematism is a sufficiently successful strategy to have had significant effects on the evolution of both aposematic and non-aposematic species. Non- aposematic species have often evolved to mimic the conspicuous markings of their aposematic counterparts. For example, the hornet moth is a deceptive mimic of the yellowjacket wasp; it resembles the wasp, but has no sting. A predator which avoids the wasp will to some degree also avoid the moth. This is known as Batesian mimicry, after Henry Walter Bates, a British naturalist who studied Amazonian butterflies in the second half of the 19th century.; Reprint: Batesian mimicry is frequency dependent: it is most effective when the ratio of mimic to model is low; otherwise, predators will encounter the mimic too often. A second form of mimicry occurs when two aposematic organisms share the same anti-predator adaptation and non-deceptively mimic each other, to the benefit of both species, since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them. This form of mimicry is known as M√ºllerian mimicry, after Fritz M√ºller, a German naturalist who studied the phenomenon in the Amazon in the late 19th century. Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are M√ºllerian mimics; their similar coloration teaches predators that a striped pattern is associated with being stung. Therefore, a predator which has had a negative experience with any such species will likely avoid any that resemble it in the future. M√ºllerian mimicry is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range, each of which looks very similar to a different species of poison frog which lives in that area.

It was presumably built in the 11th century and was originally known as castle Hachberg. The line of nobles known as the Margraves of Baden-Hachberg most likely derive their name from this castle and before it was razed by the French it was the second largest fortification in Baden.  The Name  Historians are uncertain about where the name Hachberg comes from. One theory is that an estate in the region was given to a man referred to as Hacho who was a part of Charlemagnes retinue. This hypothesis is also supported by an engraved plaque added to the castle by Karl II and a document dating back to 1161 mentions it as Castro Hahberc. In any case, whoever the true builder of the castle is most likely chose its name for their lineage, resulting in the family sidebranch of the house of Baden known as Baden-Hachberg. The first mention of a transition from Hachberg to Hochberg can be found in French sources concerned with members of the lineage of Hachberg-Sausenberg, who were the counts of Neuenburg as well. The name Hochberg sees its German revival as late as 1787, when Margrave Karl Friedrich, as second husband, married Luise Karoline Freiin Geyer von Geyersberg and made her the Imperial Countess of Hochberg.  History  left = The Lords of Hachberg = Dietrich von Emmendingen (who later called himself von Hachberg) most likely founded the castle to harvest the forests surrounding it for lumber. Its first mention dates back to a document from 1127. The further development of later property documents suggests that Erkenbold von Hachberg, the last of his name, gave his holdings to the Z√§hringer to finance his participation in the crusades (1147‚Äì1149). = The Margraves of Baden 1161-1212 = A document on the talks about the founding of the monastery Tennenbach from 1161 implies that Hermann IV von Baden was the reigning lord of castle Hachberg at the time. When his sons Hermann V and Henrich I divided the margraviate among each other in 1212 the castle became the centre of power for the margraves of Baden-Hachberg. = The Margraves of Baden-Hachberg 1212-1415 = Margrave Bernhard I of the main family of Baden acquired the castle from the highly indebted Margrave Otto II von Baden- Hachberg. = The Margraves of Baden 1415-1535 = The castle survived the war of the Oberrheinischer St√§dtebund versus Bernhard I in 1424 and even withstood siege during the German Peasant's War in 1525. = The Margraves of Baden- Durlach 1535-1771 = Karl II greatly enhanced the castle's defences in 1553 and turned it into a more modern, renaissance style fortification. Margrave Georg Friedrich added 7 bastions around the castle's perimeter and gave some the names of Hachbergs sister castles in Baden all of which laid in the realm of Margraves of Baden-Durlach. (Bastion R√∂tteln; Bastion Sausenberg; Bastion Badenweiler) The castle was besieged for two years during the Thirty Years' War in 1634 and was slighted for the first time after surrendering to the attackers. However, in 1660 Margrave Friedrich VI induced the reconstruction of the castle. Hochburg 1609  Demolition  In 1681 the defences were destroyed voluntarily by the French after they had taken many of the holdings in Baden through the Treaty of peace of Nijmegen and a manned castle Hachberg could have posed a sizable threat to their new territory. Only three years later peasants caused a fire which destroyed the remaining living quarters. And in 1688 French troops destroyed what little remained of the fortification, turning it into a ruin. = Preservation of the ruin = The first steps at preserving the ruin were taken towards the end of the 19th century and still persist to this day. Work was only temporarily halted during the two world wars. The Society for the conservation of the Hochburg has been taking care of the ruin on voluntary work since 1971 and in 2007 they bought the tenancy of the castle.  Today  The Hochburg can be visited by anyone free of charge. It is part of the program for the state preservation of castles and gardens in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and in 1991 a small museum was added in the cellar. The castle has been depicted in several paintings and has many mythical tales surrounding it, speaking of hidden treasure and restless knights, waiting to return.

The Republic's constitution was enacted on 1 October 1920 and amended on 7 December 1929. The republican period was increasingly marked by violent strife between those with left-wing and right-wing views, leading to the July Revolt of 1927 and the Austrian Civil War of 1934.  Foundation  Lands claimed by German-Austria in 1918 In September 1919, the Habsburg rump state of German-Austria was given reduced borders by the Treaty of Saint Germain, which ceded German-populated regions in Sudetenland to Czechoslovakia, German-populated South Tyrol to Italy and a portion of Alpine provinces to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca, or SHS). Despite Austrian protests this treaty also forbade Anschluss, or union of Austria with Germany, without League of Nations consent. The new Republic was created by the will of Allies who did not want the defeated Germany to expand its borders. The new state managed to prevent two land claims from being taken by their neighbours. The first was the south- eastern part of Carinthia, which was inhabited partly by Slovenians. It was prevented from being taken over by the new SHS-state through a Carinthian plebiscite on October 10, 1920, in which the majority of population chose to remain with Austria. The second prevented land-claim was Hungary's claim to Burgenland, which, under the name \\"Western Hungary\\", had been part of the Hungarian kingdom since 907. It was inhabited mostly by a German-speaking population, but had also Croat- and Hungarian-speaking minorities. Through the Treaty of St. Germain it became part of the Austrian Republic in 1921. However, after a plebiscite which was disputed by Austria, the provincial capital city of Sopron (German √ñdenburg) remained in Hungary. The treaty of Saint Germain angered the German population in Austria who claimed that it violated the Fourteen Points laid out by United States President Woodrow Wilson during peace talks, specifically the right to \\"self-determination\\" of all nations. Many of them felt that with the loss of 60% of the territory of the prewar empire, Austria was no longer economically and politically viable as a separate state without union with Germany. In a now small country of 6.5 million people, Vienna, with its population of almost 2 million, was left as an imperial capital without an empire to feed it, as only 17.8% of Austrian land was arable. For much of the early 1920s, Austria's survival was very much in doubt. This was partly because Austria had never been a German/Austrian nation state in the true sense of the term. Although the Austrian state had existed in one form or another for 700 years, it had no real unifying force other than the Habsburg dynasty and the provincial identities of Tyroleans, Carinthians and others were much stronger.  Government and politics, 1920‚Äì1934  The new constitution created bi-cameral legislature with upper house Bundesrat formed by representatives from federal Lands and lower house Nationalrat, where deputies were elected in universal elections. The Federal President was elected for a four-year term in a full session of both houses, while the Chancellor was elected by the Nationalrat. As no political party ever gained parliamentary majority, Austria was governed by coalitions of conservative Christian Social Party and right-wing Greater German People's Party or Landbund which were more conservative than the first government of Social Democrat Karl Renner of 1919‚Äì20, that had established a number of progressive socioeconomic and labour legislations. After 1920, Austria's government was dominated by the anti-AnschlussDIVIDE ON GERMAN AUSTRIA. - Centrists Favor Union, but Strong Influences Oppose It., The New York Times, January 17, 1919 (PDF) Christian Social Party which retained close ties to the Roman Catholic Church. The party's first Chancellor Ignaz Seipel came to power in May 1922 and attempted to forge a political alliance between wealthy industrialists and the Roman Catholic Church. After the legislative elections of October 17, 1920 Social Democrats lost parliamentary majority and remained in the opposition until 1934, when they were banned by Dollfuss. Christian Socials won 85, Social Democrats 69, Greater Germany Party 20 and Peasants Union 8 seats. Michael Hainisch was elected Federal President. After October 1923 elections Ignaz Seipel stayed in power and resigned in November 1924 when he was succeeded by Rudolf Ramek. In December 1928 Cristian Social Wilhelm Miklas was elected to the post of Federal President and on 7 December 1929 Constitution was amended, reducing the rights of parliament, making the Federal President electable by a popular vote and giving him the right to appoint the federal government and to issue emergency laws. After the 1930 legislative elections Social Democrats emerged as the largest party with 72 seats, but Christian Social Chancellor Otto Ender created a coalition government without them. = Left‚Äìright clashes = Heimwehr parade, 1928 Social Democrats celebrating 1 May 1932 Despite the nation having a steady political party in power, the politics of the nation were fractious and violent, with both Social Democrat (Republikanischer Schutzbund) and right- wing (Heimwehr) political paramilitary forces clashing with each other. The country was divided between the conservative countryside population and Social Democrat controlled Red Vienna. In 1927, during a political clash in Schattendorf, an old man and a child were shot and killed by Heimwehr. On 14 July 1927 the shooters were acquitted and left-wing supporters began a massive protest during which the Ministry of Justice building was burned. To restore order police and army shot and killed 89 people and injured 600. The huge protest is known as the July Revolt of 1927. Social Democrats called for a general strike which lasted four days. After the 1927 events the conservative elements became stronger and the violence in Austria continued to escalate until the early 1930s when Engelbert Dollfuss became Chancellor.  Economy  25 schilling golden coin One of the many apartment buildings built in Red Vienna However the new state was difficult to control, as much of the former empire's important economic regions had been taken away with the foundation of new nation-states. The matter was further complicated by the fact that a number of these new nation-states were still dependent on Vienna's banks, but business was hampered by the newly erected borders and tariffs. The landlocked Austria was barely able to support itself with food and lacked developed industrial basis. In addition, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia and Italy had imposed trade blockade and refused to sell food and coal to Austria, which eventually was saved by aid and support from the Western Allies. By 1922 one USA dollar was worth 19,000 kronen and half the population was unemployed. In December 1921 the Treaty of Lana between Austria and Czechoslovakia was signed in which Austria recognized the new state borders and relinquished claims to represent ethnic Germans in return Czechoslovakia provided a loan of 500 million kronen to Austria. To deal with post-war inflation Chancellor Ignaz Seipel in 1922 asked for foreign loans and introduced austerity policies. In October 1922 Britain, France, Italy and Czechoslovakia provided a loan of 650 million gold kronen after Seipel promised not to attempt Anschluss with Germany for 20 years and allowed the League of Nations to control Austria's economy. During the next two years state budget was stabilized and international supervision over finances ended in March 1926. Austria's central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank was re-established in 1923, sales tax was introduced in 1923, and the Austrian schilling replaced krone in December 1924. The Great Depression hit Austria hard and in May 1931 the largest bank in Austria, Creditanstalt Bank collapsed. To improve its economy Austria wanted to conclude a customs union with Germany, but in 1931 this was denied by France and countries of the Little Entente.  Austrofascism  Dollfuss addressing the League of Nations in 1933 Austrian soldiers during the brief civil war of 1934 Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss of the Christian Social Party took power in Austria on 20 May 1932, and moved the party and Austria towards dictatorship, centralisation and fascism, in part because the fascist Italy was its strongest international ally against Germany. In March 1933, Dollfuss took advantage of an error in a bill in parliament, and his cabinet voted to dissolve the National Council and declared that parliament had ceased to function. In May 1933 he created the Fatherland Front. While outwardly fascist, it was mostly Catholic and influenced by the papal encyclical Quadragesimo anno of 1931 which refuted liberalism and socialism in favour of corporatism. The government was in competition with the growing Austrian Nazi party, which wanted Austria to join Germany. Dollfuss's Austrofascism tied Austria identity to Roman Catholicism as a means to show the reason why Austria should not join a predominantly Protestant Germany. Political violence escalated into the Austrian Civil War of February 1934, between Nazis, Social Democrats and government forces. On 1 May 1934, Dollfuss created a one-party state, to be led by the Fatherland Front (), with the proclamation of the authoritarian \\"May Constitution\\". Name of the country was changed from the \\"Republic of Austria\\" to the \\"Federal State of Austria\\". The flag, coat of arms and anthem were changed, too. Federalism and the controlling powers of the Federal Council was curtailed, while elections for the National Council was abolished, its members nominated by four non-elective, corporatist-styled councils ‚Äì the State Council (Staatsrat), Federal Culture Council (Bundeskulturrat), Federal Economic Council (Bundeswirtschaftsrat) and the States' Council (L√§nderrat), supposedly providing their best opinions on respective areas. In practice all legislation and appointments were exercised from above by the Federal Chancellor's and President's decree. The state took complete control of employer‚Äìemployee relations, known as St√§ndestaat, and began to crack down on pro-Nazi and pro‚ÄìGerman-unification sympathizers. The Nazis responded by assassinating Engelbert Dollfuss during the July Putsch of 25 July 1934 (see Maiverfassung 1934). This assassination by the Austrian Nazis infuriated Austria's neighbor, Fascist Italy under dictator Benito Mussolini. Fascist Italy had good relations with Austria under Dollfuss and Mussolini suspected German involvement and promised the Austrofascist regime military support if Germany were to invade, as the Nazis had claims on Italian-administered Tyrol. Italy's support helped save Austria from potential annexation in 1934. The successor to Dollfuss, Kurt Schuschnigg, maintained the ban on Nazi activities, but also banned Austria's national paramilitary force, the Heimwehr in 1936.

Since 1966, this foundation has raised tens of millions of dollars to construct the museum, build exhibits, recover and restore aircraft, and develop educational programs like the National Flight Academy. Practice demonstrations by the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, may be viewed from the museum most Tuesday and Wednesday mornings between March and November. These practices are weather permitting, and a tentative practice schedule may be viewed on the Blue Angels' website. Captain Robert L. Rasmussen, a retired Navy captain, former Navy fighter pilot and former Blue Angels demonstration pilot, served as museum director for 27 years and reported to the Naval History & Heritage Command. Also an artist, some of his works are displayed in the museum. Captain Rasmussen retired as director in 2014 and was replaced by Captain Sterling Gilliam, Jr. History The museum was established 14 December 1962 with the initial facility located in a cramped 8,500 square foot building aboard the air station that had been erected during World War II and which was dedicated in June 1963. The Phase I portion of the current facility was dedicated Sunday 13 April 1975, although it had been informally open since November 1974. Construction of the new location began in November 1972.Coleman, J.

The cover art depicts certain symbols of Freemasonry, most notably the compass and the square. Drummer Warren Cann wrote the chorus of \\"Hymn\\" and was heavily inspired by The Zones' Song \\"Mourning Star\\" (1977). Chris Cross wrote the verses with the help of Midge Ure, while Billy Currie wrote the bridge section. Lyrically, the song describes a time of corruption, in which \\"all that's good will fall from grace\\" and \\"Different words [...] have other meaning\\"; the protagonist expresses his worldly ambitions for \\"power and glory\\" in phrases from Bible (\\"the storybook\\"), especially The Lord's Prayer. In line with this theme, the music video depicts a diabolical figure (played by Oliver Tobias) seducing men struggling in their fields (an actor, a politician, a musician and an office assistant, played by the four Ultravox members).

The postal code for Darlingford is R0G 0L0. Darlingford was founded by James Ephraim Law, builder of the first house in the town. The Law cairn was erected and is a tribute to the steadfast love of family and community that was inherent in the life of John Oliver and Sara Law. They instilled these same virtues in their thirteen children that they raised on this very site. John Oliver is the son of James Ephriam Law. James was said to have purchased this NW8-3-7W in 1898 but the registration did not take place until 1902. A Manitoba Historical Plaque was erected in Darlingford by the province to commemorate Darlingford Memorial and Park's role in Manitoba's heritage. In 1921, Darlingford and the surrounding district commemorated their military efforts and their war dead by constructing a small Gothic-inspired memorial building and park. The Darlingford Memorial Park was largely inspired by Ferris Bolton, a pioneer farmer and politician from Darlingford, whose three sons were killed in France in 1917. Maintained today by local volunteers, it remains the only free- standing memorial building in Manitoba with the sole function of commemorating the war dead. Two black marble tablets inside the structure display the names of 199 local veterans and victims of both World War I and World War II. The memorial was designated a Manitoba Provincial Heritage Site on March 29, 1991 by the Government of Manitoba. As early as 1905, the Manitoba Department of Education was experimenting with consolidation to better serve local communities and students. It was thought that a bigger and better equipped school, in a centralized location, provided better education. Darlingford Consolidated School No. 1228, completed in 1910 on a design by Winnipeg architect F. R. Evans, is an example of those developments. Built of brick, the entrance tower is notably off-centre so that, as the school enrollment grew, another wing would be added on the south side of the building. That never happened at Darlingford. The building features a rare fire escape system off the second floor at the rear. The building is now home for the Darlingford School Heritage Museum.

Conception Meduza is an aggregator of news, texts and podcasts in Russian that are selected manually, unlike the automatic rankings of Yandex News. The main criterion for publication of content is the relevance and reliability of the information, not the status of the source. Also, Meduza creates its own materials. The site includes five main topics, and has no sections or columns. One of the formats of the publication is the analysis of complex issues using cards, similar to the American project vox.com.  History  In 2014, Galina Timchenko was fired from her job as chief editor at Lenta.ru. and launched the new webpage Meduza in October 2014. Several former journalists of Lenta.ru joined the new online site. Timchenko told Forbes that the decision to base Meduza in Latvia was made since \\"right now, establishing an independent Russian language publishing house in Latvia is possible, while in Russia it is not.\\" Moreover, Timchenko stated: ‚ÄúWe understood that in Russia, most likely, they would not let us work\\". Russian businessman and former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and telecommunications magnate Boris Zimin had been considered as passive investors, but they parted ways \\"for strategic and operational reasons\\". Because of financial reasons, Timchenko and her partner at Amond & Smith Ltd, Sergey Nazarkin, based Meduza in Latvia. In February 2015, the website also launched an English-language version. In January 2016, founder and CEO Galina Timchenko handed over the role of chief editor to her, deputy Ivan Kolpakov.Meduza chief editor steps down, remains as CEO, Meduza, January 28, 2016. In November 2018, Kolpakov announced his resignation due to a sexual harassment scandal.A harassment scandal at Meduza He was reinstated as chief editor on March 11, 2019. In August 2018, Meduza started a partnership with the American website BuzzFeed. The partnership includes publishing each other‚Äôs materials, sharing experiences, and carrying out and publishing joint investigations. In 2019, Meduza started the English podcast The Naked Pravda, which highlights how Meduza‚Äôs top reporting intersects with the wider research and expertise that exists about Russia.https://mdza.io/naked-pravda  Structure  Meduza is run by a team of around 20 journalists who resigned from their jobs at Lenta.ru following Galina Timchenko's unexpected removal from her post by the website's owner and Vladimir Putin supporter, the oligarch Alexander Mamut. There are no Latvian journalists in the project. Since March 2015, Meduza has published daily news called ‚ÄúEvening Meduza‚Äù.  Audience  Three months after opening, Meduza had 1.3 million monthly readers of its Internet publication. In 2017, Meduza had 7.5 million readers per month and 2 million followers on social media. Censorship According to Timchenko, Meduza will not only serve as an aggregator but will also produce its own content. So it aims to fill a market niche that exists due to \\"a long list of forbidden topics which Russian media do not raise for various reasons‚Äîdue to direct and indirect censorship.\\" The day after it was launched, Meduza was blocked in Kazakhstan, probably due to an article about the city of Oskemen (Ust-Kamenogorsk). Access to the site has also been blocked from Uzbekistan. The reasons for this are unclear. Meduza has installed technical measures to circumvent censorship with their mobile apps. In June 2019, Meduza journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested by Russian police for claimed drug offences. Colleagues and friends of Golunov said they believed the charges to be fabricated, motivated by his investigations into corruption. Following a public outcry, Golunov was released, and five police officers were fired and later arrested.

The Spanish- Swiss co-production was released in the United States as Chimes at Midnight and in most of Europe as Falstaff. The film's plot centres on William Shakespeare's recurring character Sir John Falstaff and the father-son relationship he has with Prince Hal, who must choose between loyalty to his father, King Henry IV, or Falstaff. Welles said that the core of the film's story was \\"the betrayal of friendship.\\" It stars Welles as Falstaff, Keith Baxter as Prince Hal, John Gielgud as Henry IV, Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tearsheet and Margaret Rutherford as Mistress Quickly. The script contains text from five of Shakespeare's plays; primarily Henry IV, Part 1 and Henry IV, Part 2, but also Richard II, Henry V, and The Merry Wives of Windsor. Ralph Richardson's narration is taken from the works of chronicler Raphael Holinshed. Welles had previously produced a Broadway stage adaptation of nine Shakespeare plays called Five Kings in 1939. In 1960, he revived this project in Ireland as Chimes at Midnight, which was his final on-stage performance. Neither of these plays was successful, but Welles considered portraying Falstaff to be his life's ambition and turned the project into a film. In order to get initial financing, Welles lied to producer Emiliano Piedra about intending to make a version of Treasure Island, and keeping the film funded during its production was a constant struggle. Welles shot Chimes at Midnight throughout Spain between 1964 and 1965; it premiered at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival, winning two awards there. Initially dismissed by most film critics, Chimes at Midnight is now regarded as one of Welles' highest achievements, and Welles himself called it his best work. Welles felt a strong connection to the character of Falstaff and called him \\"Shakespeare's greatest creation\\". Some film scholars and Welles' collaborators have made comparisons between Falstaff and Welles, while others see a resemblance between Falstaff and Welles' father. Disputes over the ownership of Chimes at Midnight made it difficult to view the film legally until recently. It was released in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray in 2015. A new restoration by Janus Films and The Criterion Collection was screened at the Film Forum in New York January 1‚Äì12, 2016. The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on August 30, 2016.  Plot  The film opens with Sir John Falstaff and Justice Shallow walking through the snow, then to a warm fire inside the Boar's Head Tavern, as the two reminisce. After a main credit sequence, the narrator explains that King Henry IV of England has succeeded Richard II, whom he has killed. Richard II's true heir, Edmund Mortimer, is a prisoner in Wales, and Mortimer's cousins Northumberland, Worcester, and Northumberland's son Hotspur demand that Henry rescue Mortimer. The king refuses, and thus Mortimer's cousins begin to plot Henry's overthrow. To Henry's great dissatisfaction, his son Prince Hal spends most of his time at the Boar's Head Tavern, drinking and carousing with prostitutes, thieves and other criminals under Falstaff's patriarchal influence. Falstaff insists that he and Hal should think of themselves as gentlemen, but Hal warns Falstaff that he will one day reject both this lifestyle and Falstaff. The next morning Hal, Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Poins disguise themselves in Gadshill to prepare to rob a group of traveling pilgrims. After Falstaff, Bardolph, and Peto rob the pilgrims, Hal and Poins jump out in disguises and take the stolen treasure from Falstaff as a joke. Back at the Boar's Head Tavern, Falstaff begins to tell Hal and Poins with increasing exaggeration the story of how the money was stolen from him. Hal and Poins poke holes in Falstaff's tale until they reveal their joke to the entire group. In celebration of the newly recovered stolen treasure, Falstaff and Hal take turns impersonating Henry, with a cooking pot crown and vocal impressions. Falstaff's Henry chastises Hal for spending his time with common criminals, but names Sir John Falstaff as his one virtuous friend. Hal's Henry calls Falstaff a \\"misleader of youth\\". Hal visits the King at the castle and Henry scolds him for his criminal and unethical life-style. Henry warns Hal about Hotspur's growing army and its threat to his crown. Hal passionately vows to his unimpressed father that he will defend Henry and redeem his good name. The King's army, including Falstaff, parades through the streets and off to war. Before the battle, Henry meets with Worcester and offers to forgive all of Hotspur's men of treason if they surrender immediately. Hal vows to personally kill Hotspur. Worcester returns to his camp and lies to Hotspur, telling him that Henry intends to execute all traitors. The two armies meet in the Battle of Shrewsbury (1403), but Falstaff hides in shrubs for most of the conflict. After a long and bloody fight, the King's men win the battle, after which Hotspur and Hal meet alone and duel; as Falstaff watches, Hal kills Hotspur. Henry sentences Worcester to death and takes his men as prisoners. Falstaff brings Hotspur's body to Henry, claiming that he killed Hotspur; Henry does not believe Falstaff, instead looking disapprovingly at Hal and the ignoble company he keeps. The narrator explains that all of Henry IV's rebellious enemies had been killed by 1408, but that Henry's health has begun to deteriorate. At the castle, Henry becomes upset when told that Hal is once again spending time with Falstaff, and collapses. Hal visits the castle and discovers that Henry is sicker than he had realized. Hal vows to Henry to be a good and noble king. Henry finally has faith in Hal and advises him on how to be a king. Henry dies and Hal tells his men that he is now King Henry V. Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit in front of a warm fire, continuing from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal went on to become a good and noble king.

Welles tried to stage a three-and-a-half-hour combination of several of Shakespeare's historical plays called The Winter of Our Discontent in which he played Richard III.France, Richard. The Theatre of Orson Welles. Lewisberg and London: Bucknell University Press. 1977. . pp. 24-26. School officials forced him to make cuts to the production. Chimes at Midnight originated in 1939 as a stage play called Five Kings, which Welles wrote and partially staged. It was an ambitious adaptation of several Shakespeare plays that chronicled the stories of Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI and Richard III. Its sources were Richard II, Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2, Henry V, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Henry VI, Part 1, Henry VI, Part 2, Henry VI, Part 3 and Richard IIIsometimes collectively called the \\"War of the Roses cycle\\". The grouping of Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2 and Henry V are often referred to as the Henriad. = Five Kings (1939) = Five Kings was announced as part of the newly revived Mercury Theatre's second season in 1938. John Houseman had secured a partnership with the prestigious Theatre Guild to produce the play for , with an initial tour of Baltimore, Boston, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia before debuting on Broadway. Welles' intended to stage only the first part of the playwhich was primarily taken from Henry IV Parts 1 and 2 and Henry Vduring the tour while simultaneously rehearsing Part Two and finally debuting the full production on Broadway. Houseman stated that the play's aim was \\"to combine the immediate quality of the Elizabethan with all the devices and techniques possible in the modern theatre.\\" The cast included Welles as Falstaff, Burgess Meredith as Prince Hal, John Emery as Hotspur, Morris Ankrum as Henry IV and Robert Speaight as the Narrator.France, Richard. Orson Welles on Shakespeare. New York/London: Routledge. 2001. . pp. 174-175. The play's music was composed by Aaron Copland. Welles commissioned an elaborate revolving set to be built, but it was not completed during the five weeks allotted to rehearsals. Welles avoided attending the rehearsals or finishing the play's final script and instead often went out drinking and socializing with co-star Meredith, with the result that only specific scenes or fragments of the play were ever rehearsed. The Baltimore performance was eventually dropped and at the first dress rehearsal in Boston, it was discovered that the play was over five and a half hours long and contained 46 scenes. Welles cut 14 scenes and shortened others, which caused the built-in timer for the revolving set to move out of synchronization. Five Kings, Part 1 premiered at the Colonial Theatre in Boston on February 27, 1939, and was a disaster. Critics were either scathing or apologetic, and only the play's battle scenes received praise. By the end of the Boston run, the Theatre Guild was on the verge of dropping the production, and canceled the D.C. engagement. Welles then edited the show to three and a half hours. The play closed after only a few performances in Philadelphia, and the Theatre Guild terminated its contract with the Mercury Theater. Photographs of the play's rehearsals show similarities to Chimes at Midnight, including the Boar's Head Tavern set and the character blocking of the \\"chimes at midnight\\" scene with Falstaff, Shallow and Silence. = Chimes at Midnight (1960) = Welles returned to the project in 1960, with performances in Belfast and Dublin. This version, now retitled Chimes at Midnight, was produced by Welles' old friend Hilton Edwards through his Dublin-based company Gate Theatre. The cast included Welles as Falstaff, Keith Baxter as Prince Hal, Hilton Edwards as the Narrator, Reginald Jarman as Henry IV and Alexis Kanner as Hotspur. At one point, Welles and Edwards wanted Miche√°l Mac Liamm√≥ir to replace Jarman as Henry IV, but Mac Liamm√≥ir would only accept the role of Prince Hal. Hilton Edwards was officially credited as director, but Welles is usually acknowledged as the actual director and was often the director throughout rehearsals. Welles' alleged biological son Michael Lindsay-Hogg also worked on the play as an actor and as Edwards's personal assistant. Welles' opinion of Falstaff had intensified since first playing the part, and his new version of the play focused more upon the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal than on the historical story of Hal's defeat of Hotspur. Most of the scenes from Henry V used in the first version before were removed. Welles intended to perform the play in Belfast, Dublin and London before filming it in Yugoslavia. Rehearsals for the play began in Russell Square, London, with a read-through. After a week of rehearsing, Welles left to secure further funding and Edwards directed the play, working on blocking and lighting. Welles returned a week before the premiere without having learned a line. The cast had their technical rehearsal the night before opening. which lasted until 8 a.m. the next morning. They never had a dress rehearsal or even a run-through and had never seen Welles without the book or in costume. After premiering at the Grand Opera House in Belfast on February 13, 1960, and receiving a good review from a Variety correspondent, it moved to the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin. For two nights Orson did a one man show, starting with readings of J.M Synge, Riders to the Sea, Moby Dick and the works of Isak Dinesen. The 2nd half was a TV show with questions from the audience. Afterwards it was revealed that the TV cameras were fake, just to attract an audience. Welles continued to adjust the play throughout its short production, and at one point moved Mistress Quickly's speech about Falstaff's death to the very beginning of the play.Hapgood, Robert & Beja, Morris (editor). Perspectives on Orson Welles. New York: G. K. Hall & Company. 1995. . pp. 197. Welles finally abandoned the entire project in late March 1960, when his friend Laurence Olivier offered him the chance to direct him in Eug√®ne Ionesco's play Rhinoceros on London's West End. According to Keith Baxter, Welles ended the play's run because he was bored with it, and at one point told Baxter \\"This is only a rehearsal for the movie, Keith, and I'll never make it unless you play Hal in that too.\\" Five years later, Baxter and Welles' youngest daughter, Beatrice Welles, who played Falstaff's page, were the only cast members from the play to appear in the film. Chimes at Midnight was Welles' final performance in a theatrical play.  Production  = Preproduction = Orson Welles in Spain while shooting Chimes at Midnight c. 1964 In 1964, Welles met and befriended Spanish film producer Emiliano Piedra, who wanted to work with him. Piedra did not think a Shakespearian film was marketable enough and proposed that Welles make a version of Treasure Island instead. Welles agreed to this on condition that he could simultaneously make Chimes at Midnight, and Piedra agreed not knowing that Welles had no intention of making Treasure Island. Although some B-roll footage of the Alicante departing from port was shot early in the production, no scenes from Treasure Island were ever shot or even scripted. Welles got away with this trick throughout preproduction by building sets that could be used in both films, such as Mistress Quickly's Boar's Head Tavern, which would double as the Admiral Benbow Inn. Welles also cast each actor in both films, casting himself as Long John Silver, Baxter as Dr. Livesey, Beckley as Israel Hands and Gielgud as Squire Trelawney. Ironically, Welles would eventually play Long John Silver in the unrelated 1972 film version of Treasure Island. Welles said that the Boar's Head Tavern was the only full set built for the film, and the other sets were simply dressed or decorated on location. Welles stated that he designed, painted and blow-torched the set, and designed all of the film's costumes. Early in pre-production Welles was approached by Anthony Perkins to play Prince Hal, but Welles had already promised the role to Keith Baxter. Hilton Edwards was initially cast as Justice Silence, but was replaced after he became ill. The title Chimes at Midnight derives from Henry IV, Part 2, where in response to Justice Shallow's reminiscing of their long-past school days, Falstaff states: \\"We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow\\". Welles scholar Bridget Gellert Lyons said that the film's title, \\"which is given further resonance by the repeated intoning of bells throughout the film, is associated for the audience with sadness and mortality more than youthful carousal.\\" = Filming = Orson Welles in Chimes at Midnight The film was shot in Spain from September 1964 until April 1965, with a break in filming from late December until late February. Welles' limitations on the film included a budget of $800,000 and actors Jeanne Moreau and John Gielgud being available for five and ten days respectively, while Margaret Rutherford was available for only four weeks. Welles later joked that during one scene that included seven principal characters, none of the actors was available and stand-ins were used for over-the-shoulder shots of all seven characters. Filming began in Colmenar and included all of John Gielgud's scenes. Welles then traveled to Cardona, where the Royal Court scenes and Marina Vlady's scenes were shot, and to Madrid's Casa de Campo Park, where the Gadshill robbery scene was filmed. Madrid was also the location of the Boar's Head Tavern set, where Welles shot Moreau's and Rutherford's scenes. The production then traveled to Pedraza for some outdoor street scenes, and then to Soria to shoot in the snow for the opening shots. After shooting some scenes with Justice Shallow and Justice Silence in the Basque country, Welles returned to Madrid in December to film the battle scenes in Casa de Campo Park for ten days. By late December, Welles had run out of money and the film was put on hold while he searched for additional funding. However, some small scenes were shot during the break. Welles later said that he had rejected offers for funding that were conditional upon filming in color. Welles eventually secured funding from Harry Saltzman and production officially resumed in late February with most of Keith Baxter's longer speeches and the Coronation scene in Madrid. Between March and April, Welles finished the film with filler shots, close-ups, the final rejection scene and most of Falstaff's speeches. According to Keith Baxter, Welles had stage fright and delayed all of his scenes until the very end of filming, except for scenes that included other actors. Welles was timid about shooting his love scene with Moreau, and used a double whenever possible. Other filming locations included the Chateau Calata√±azor, Puerta de San Vincente, the Soria Cathedral and the city of √Åvila. Welles was harsh with his crew members and according to actor Andrew Faulds, \\"he spoke in five different languages to them and was pretty offensivevery demanding. I suppose he'd worked out that if you bullied actors, you didn't get the best from them whereas, to hell with the technicians. They had to do as they were told, and pretty quick.\\" A scene depicting the assassination of King Richard II, originally intended to open the film, was cut. = Post-production = Keith Baxter said that the film's soundtrack was post-dubbed months after filming was completed, and that actors Fernando Rey and Marina Vlady were dubbed by different actors because of their heavy accents. Baxter also stated that he, Welles and Michael Aldridge recorded voices for several characters in post-production. Mistress Quickly's speech after Falstaff's death, which was disrupted by the audible hum of a power generator, used the original version of the soundtrack because Welles liked Margaret Rutherford's performance enough to keep it. The score was composed by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, who had worked with Welles on Othello. The score was recorded in an Italian studio, which paid Lavagnino for his work on the film in exchange for the rights to the music, and later released a soundtrack album in Italy and the UK. During the editing, Welles showed a rough cut to the visiting head of the Cannes Film Festival, who immediately wanted to include the film in the festival, and Welles had to finish the editing more quickly than he preferred.  Style  = Cinematography = Welles had originally wanted the entire film to use high-contrast cinematography, resembling engravings of the Middle Ages; only the opening title sequence uses this technique. The film's most famous sequence is the Battle of Shrewsbury; only about 180 extras were available and Welles used editing techniques to give the appearance of armies of thousands. Welles filmed all of the battle scenes in long takes, but cut the shots into fragments to create the effect that he wanted. It took ten days to shoot the scenes and six weeks to edit what became a six-minute sequence. In filming the sequence, Welles often used hand-held cameras, wide-angle lenses, slow motion and speed up shots, static shots, swish pans and constant rapid movement of the characters to create a kinetic and chaotic atmosphere. Anderegg has said that \\"in the end, both armies have become one huge, awkward, disintegrating war machine, a grotesque robot whose power source slowly begins to fail and finally comes to a frozen halt. Verbal rhetoric‚Äîlanguage itself‚Äîseems, for the moment, both irrelevant and obscene.\\" The Battle of Shrewsbury sequence has often been called an anti- war statement by film critics and likened to contemporary films like Dr. Strangelove and Culloden. Shakespearean scholar Daniel Seltzer said that \\"the social consciousness of the movie is as alert as Shakespeare's, and thematically pertinent in Shakespearean terms too ... the footage of the Battle of Shrewsbury itself must be some of the finest, truest, ugliest scenes of warfare ever shot and edited for a movie.\\" Welles scholar James Naremore said that \\"the underlying eroticism of the chivalric code ... is exposed in all its cruel perversity.\\" Tony Howard wrote that Welles used Shakespeare's historical plays \\"to denounce modern political hypocrisy and militarism.\\"Jackson, Russell. Shakespeare on Film. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2000. . pp. 296. = Sound = Due to budgetary constraints, both the on-set and post-production sound was poorly recorded. Anderegg wrote that this, in combination with Welles' fast-paced camera movements and editing, makes the Shakespearean dialogue more difficult to understand. Many scenes are shot in long takes or with character's backs facing the camera, most likely for practical purposes when actors were not present, creating more sound problems. \\"In effect,\\" Anderegg writes, \\"Welles generates a constant tension between what we see and what we hear, a tension that points to the ambiguous status of language in its relation to action.\\" During the Battle of Shrewsbury sequence, Welles used a complex and layered soundtrack that included the sounds of swords and armor clanking, soldiers grunting and screaming, bones breaking, boots in the mud and the film's musical score to add to the chaos of the scene. = Interpretation of Shakespeare = Welles' adaptation of five Shakespeare plays was not a chronological transcription of the original texts. Shakespearean scholar Kenneth S. Rothwell said that Welles \\"goes beyond mere tinkering with Shakespeare's scenes; [he] massively reworks, transposes, revises and deletes, indeed reconstructs them.\\" These changes included taking lines of dialogue from one play and inserting them into scenes from another. Specific changes include a scene near the end of the film in which Hal pardons an imprisoned street rabble-rouser just before his expedition to invade France; Welles slightly altered this scene from Henry V, Act 2, Scene 2. In the film it is stated that this man is Falstaff, and that the incident he is pardoning is Falstaff's disturbance of Hal's coronation. Although both the pardoned prisoner and Falstaff are said to drink wine, Shakespeare does not imply that the pardoned prisoner is Falstaff. In both Chimes at Midnight and in Henry V, this scene is followed by Falstaff's death. The film contains no true soliloquies, since characters are never alone and do not speak directly to the audience during their speeches. Henry IV is usually shown standing or sitting with very little action involvedthis, says Anderegg, makes it appear that he speaks only to himself even when others are present. Gielgud was known for his classical interpretation of Shakespeare, and his performance consists almost entirely of words, which are unable to defeat either Northumberland's rebels or Hal's wild behavior. Throughout the film, Falstaff, Hal, and Hotspur imitate Gielgud, mocking the words of Henry IV.  Reception  = Critical response = Chimes at Midnight premiered to a positive audience reception at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. However, after New York Times critic Bosley Crowther's unfavorable advance review, American distributor Harry Saltzman decided to give the film little publicity and minimal distribution when it was released in the U.S. the next year.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 1181. Critical reception on its first release was mostly negative; the film was not regarded as one of Welles' best until years later. Crowther criticized the film's poor audio track and called it \\"a confusing patchwork of scenes and characters ... designed to give major exposure to Jack Falstaff.\\" Welles' performance, he said, was \\"a dissolute, bumbling street-corner Santa Claus.\\" Penelope Houston called it \\"a film which seems to turn its back on brilliance.\\" A Time review also criticized Welles, stating that \\"[he] is probably the first actor in the history of the theater to appear too fat for the role ... he takes command of scenes less with spoken English than with body English\\", but that he is \\"never entirely bad.\\" Judith Crist praised the film as \\"stark, simple, concentrating on word and performance, serv[ing] as a reminder of where the substance of the play lies.\\" Pauline Kael also criticized the poor sound, but gave a favorable review overall, singling out the film's casting and calling Welles' performance \\"very rich, very full.\\" She said the Battle of Shrewsbury sequence was \\"unlike any battle scene done on the screen before.\\" Cahiers du Cinema critic Serge Daney also praised both the film and Welles' ability to make great films on the subject of power. Welles was disappointed with the film's reception, complaining that \\"almost nobody has seen it in America, and that drives me nuts.\\" = Legacy = Welles held Chimes at Midnight in high regard. \\"It's my favorite picture, yes,\\" he told interviewer Leslie Megahey in a 1982 interview for BBC Arena: > If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I > would offer up. I think it's because it is to me the least flawed; let me > put it that way. It is the most successful for what I tried to do. I > succeeded more completely in my view with that than with anything else.BBC > Arena. The Orson Welles Story BBC Two/BBC Four. 01:51:46-01:52:16. Broadcast > May 18, 1982. Retrieved 2012-08-01Estrin, Mark W., and Orson Welles, Orson > Welles: Interviews. Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, > 2002. He also considered it to be his most personal film, along with The Magnificent Ambersons. Many critics, including Peter Bogdanovich and Jonathan Rosenbaum, also consider Chimes at Midnight to be Welles' finest work. Several years after its initial release, film critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that Chimes at Midnight \\"may be the greatest Shakespearean film ever made, bar none.\\"Canby, Vincent, \\"The Undiminished Chutzpah of Orson Welles.\\" The New York Times, March 2, 1975, Accessed on June 9, 2012 Joseph McBride has called it \\"Welles' masterpiece, the fullest, most completely realized expression of everything he had been working towards since Citizen Kane.\\" In 2006, Roger Ebert praised the film as \\"a magnificent film, clearly among Welles' greatest work.\\" The Battle of Shrewsbury sequence has been particularly admired, and inspired later movies, including Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Film critics have compared it to the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin and the Battle on the Ice sequence in Alexander Nevsky, both directed by Sergei Eisenstein.Cook, David A. The History of Narrative Film. W.W. Norton & Company, New York, Third Edition. 1996. Kenneth Branagh's Henry V used Welles' Battle of Shrewsbury sequence as an inspiration for the Battle of Agincourt, and depicted Prince Hal's rejection of Falstaff in a way that was more influenced by Chimes at Midnight than from more traditional interpretations of the scene. In 1988, director Patrick Garland staged a version of Chimes at Midnight starring Simon Callow as Falstaff at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Michael Anderegg said that Chimes at Midnights use of wide angle lenses, low-key lighting and costumes, and its focus on the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal influenced My Own Private IdahoGus Van Sant's 1991 loose adaptation of Henry IV Parts 1 and 2. In 2011, Bonham's Auction House sold a large archive of Welles' material that had once belonged to the film's executive producer Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Most of the material was from Chimes at Midnight, and included Welles' original art-work, photographs and memoranda. This collection was later donated to the University of Michigan for scholarly study. In 2012, for the British Film Institute's Sight and Sound poll, 11 film critics and two directors voted Chimes at Midnight one of the 10 greatest films of all time, including McBride and Todd McCarthy. Spanish writer and director of the Film Library of Catalonia Esteve Riambau published a book about the film called The Things We've Seen: Welles and Falstaff in 2015. = Awards = At the 1966 Cannes Film Festival, Chimes at Midnight was screened in competition for the Palme d'Or and won the 20th Anniversary Prize and the Technical Grand Prize. Welles was nominated for a BAFTA award for Best Foreign Actor in 1968 In Spain, the film won the Citizens Writers Circle Award for Best Film in 1966. = Home media = Because of legal disputes over the rights, Chimes at Midnight has been released only twice on VHS video in the United States, neither of which is currently available. Harry Saltzman's widow Adriana Saltzman, the families of producers Emiliano Piedra and Angel Escolano and the estate of Orson Wellesmaintained by Beatrice Welles among others have all claimed ownership of the film. For many years the only available source was a region-free DVD from Brazil. Mr Bongo Records screened a restored version in the UK at Picturehouse Cinemas on August 1, 2011. In February 2015, the film was screened at the Sedona International Film Festival. Beatrice Welles attended and announced that \\"a major DVD/Blu-ray label is interested in restoring and releasing Chimes at Midnight.\\" The pristine 35mm print was discovered by Distribpix Inc., who said it was \\"in such great condition that it is begging for a full 4k scan restoration.\\" The film had a European release on DVD and Blu-ray on June 29, 2015. = 2016 restoration = Janus Films released a restored version of the film on D.C.P. that premiered on January 1, 2016, at Film Forum in New York City January 1‚Äì12, 2016 and Cinefamily in Los Angeles. This restored version is not derived from the Distribpix print. Peter Becker, Criterion's president, said that the release is the product of more than 20 years of effort: \\"There is no film we have waited longer for or worked harder to free up, and none we are prouder to present\\", he said. Criterion released this restoration on DVD and Blu-ray on August 30, 2016.  Welles and Falstaff  = Welles' views on Sir John Falstaff = Eduard von Gr√ºtzner's Falstaff with big wine jar and cup shows the traditional jolly and comical depiction of Falstaff that Welles rejected. Welles considered Falstaff to be \\"Shakespeare's greatest creation\\" and said that the role was \\"the most difficult part I've ever played.\\" Keith Baxter believed that making the film was Welles' life's ambition. Before the 1939 Boston premiere of Five Kings, Welles told journalists \\"I will play him as a tragic figure. I hope, of course, he will be funny to the audience, just as he was funny to those around him. But his humor and wit were aroused merely by the fact that he wanted to please the prince. Falstaff, however, had the potential of greatness in him.\\" Reviews for the 1939 play mention Welles' choice to downplay the traditional comedic elements of Falstaff in his performance. This reverence for the character increased over the years and by the time Welles made Chimes at Midnight, his focus was entirely on the relationships between Falstaff, Hal and Henry IV. He believed that the core of the story was \\"the betrayal of friendship.\\" Welles called Hal's rejection of Falstaff \\"one of the greatest scenes ever written, so the movie is really a preparation for it. Everything prepares for it.\\" Throughout the film, Hal constantly turns his back on Falstaff, foreshadowing the film's ending. Welles said, \\"the film was not intended as a lament for Falstaff, but for the death of Merrie England. Merrie England as a conception, a myth which has been very real to the English- speaking world, and is to some extent expressed in other countries of the Medieval epoch: the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and all that. It is more than Falstaff who is dying. It's the old England dying and betrayed.\\" Many film theorists and Welles biographers have written about the recurrent theme of the \\"Lost Eden\\" in Welles' work and of characters who are nostalgic for an idealized past, which Welles called \\"the central theme in Western culture.\\" Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that \\"even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive of such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit.\\" Film scholar Beverle Houston argued that this nostalgia made Welles' depiction of Falstaff infantile and called his performance a \\"[p]ower baby ... an eating, sucking, foetus-like creature.\\" Welles also called Falstaff \\"the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all of drama\\", and said that \\"the closer I thought I was getting to Falstaff the less funny he seemed to me. When I played him before in the theater, he seemed more witty than comical. And in bringing him to the screen, I found him only occasionally, and only deliberately, a clown.\\" = Welles' personal connections to Sir John Falstaff = Keith Baxter compared Welles to Falstaff, since they were both perpetually short of money, often lied and cheated people to get what they needed and were always merry and fun loving. Film scholar Jack Jorgens also compared Welles to Falstaff, stating that \\"to a man who directed and starred in a masterpiece and has since staggered through three decades of underfinanced, hurried, flawed films, scores of bit parts, narrations, and interviews which debased his talent, dozens of projects which died for want of persistence and financing, the story of a fat, aging jester exiled from his audience and no longer able to triumph over impossible obstacles with wit and torrential imagination might well seem tragic.\\" When Joss Ackland played Falstaff on the stage in 1982, he said that he was more inspired by Welles than by Welles' performance as Falstaff, stating that \\"like Falstaff, I believe he could have achieved so much, but it was frittered away.\\" Kenneth S. Rothwell has called Hal's rejection of Falstaff allegorical to Hollywood's rejection of Welles. Welles had become deeply depressed in the late 1950s after the disappointment of making Touch of Evil, his intended Hollywood come-back. Welles' biographer Simon Callow has compared Falstaff to Welles' father Richard Head Welles, stating that like Falstaff, Welles' father was \\"a drunkard, a trickster, a braggart, a womanizer, a gentleman and a charmerand he is rejected by the person he loves the most.\\" Welles' father was an alcoholic and womanizer who would often take a teenage Welles along with him when he was indulging in his vices. Welles observed his father much like Falstaff is observed by Hal and depends on his young prot√©g√© to bail him out of trouble. The love triangle between Prince Hal and his two father figures, Henry IV and Falstaff, is also similar to Welles' relationships with his father and the two men who became surrogate fathers to him: family friend Dr. Maurice Bernstein and Todd School for Boys headmaster Roger Hill. Both of Welles' surrogate fathers disapproved of Richard Welles' life-style and negative influence on Welles. When the younger Welles turned fifteen, he took the advice of Roger Hill and told his father that he would not see him again until he cleaned up his act and stopped drinking; Welles' father died shortly afterwards, alone and lonely, and Welles always blamed himself for his father's death, stating, \\"I always thought I killed him.\\" Welles' alleged biological son Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who was born out of wedlock to Welles and actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, first met Welles when he was 15 and later worked on the 1960 stage play Chimes at Midnight. This was the only significant amount of time that the two spent together and afterwards Lindsay-Hogg only saw Welles sporadically. Like Welles, Lindsay-Hogg had two surrogate fathers in addition to his biological father. In the late 1950s when she was sixteen years old, Welles' eldest daughter Christopher Welles Feder cut off all ties with Welles under pressure from her mother, who disapproved of Welles' influence on her. Welles and Feder later reconnected but their relationship never fully recovered. Welles' youngest daughter Beatrice, who resembled her father as a young boy, appears in the film version of Chimes at Midnight.

By contrast, a building comprising two attached units on two distinct properties is typically considered semi-detached or twin homes but is also called a duplex in parts of the Northeastern United States. The term \\"duplex\\" is not extended to three-unit and four-unit buildings, as they would be referred to with specific terms such as three-family (or triplex) and fourplex (or quadplex/quadruplex) or a more general multiplex. Because of the flexibility of the term, the line between an apartment building and a duplex is somewhat blurred, with apartment buildings tending to be bigger, while duplexes are usually the size of a single-family house. Variants =Big cities= A side by side duplex also known as a semi- detached house. In dense areas like Manhattan and downtown Chicago, a duplex or duplex apartment refers to a maisonette, a single dwelling unit spread over two floors connected by an indoor staircase. Similarly, a triplex apartment refers to an apartment spread out over three floors. These properties can be quite expensive and include the most expensive property in Manhattan as of 2006 (according to Forbes Magazine), a triplex atop The Pierre hotel.Most Expensive Homes In The U.S. 2006. Forbes.com (23 June 2006). Retrieved on 2011-06-07. In this context, an apartment locating on one floor only may be called a simplex. =UK= In the United Kingdom, the term duplex is more often used by property professionals such as architects and estate agents and refers only to a flat or apartment on two floors connected by an inner staircase though many newer apartments have open-plan designs including mezzanines. The far more commonly used term is 'maisonette'. =Australia= In Australia, a duplex is often considered a residential building containing two homes that share a common central wall. As such they are usually a mirror image of each other in layout. Also referred to as a maisonette in South Australia. =Paired home= A paired home is two homes that share a wall and have opposite side entries. The whole building is designed to look like one single larger home. Unlike a front to front duplex, the paired home helps provide more privacy for the homeowners. Urban planning In urban planning, the term duplex is used more specifically. Major Canadian cities sometimes use the term duplex to refer specifically to a building with one unit built above another. Edmonton defines 'Duplex Housing' as \\"development consisting of a building containing only two Dwellings, with one Dwelling placed over the other in whole or in part with individual and separate access to each Dwelling\\". Calgary defines Duplex Dwelling as \\"a building which contains two Dwelling Units, one located above the other, with each having a separate entrance\\". Toronto proposes in their new Zoning Bylaw to define 'Duplex Building' as a building that has only two dwelling units, and one dwelling unit is entirely or partially on top of the other dwelling unit. Halifax defines Duplex Dwelling as \\"the whole of a dwelling that is divided horizontally into two separate dwelling units, each of which has an independent entrance\\". Other major cities use the term duplex, but for dwelling units. Dallas defines the term duplex as \\"two dwelling units located on a lot\\". Philadelphia defines a duplex dwelling as \\"a dwelling occupied as the home or residence of two (2) families, under one (1) roof, each family occupying a single unit\\", a definition that excludes a pair of twin (semi- detached) houses, two dwellings separated by a firewall that extends above the roofline. Other major cities do not use the term duplex in their zoning or land-use bylaws. San Francisco and Vancouver use the term Two-family dwelling. Winnipeg uses the term Dwelling, two-family.Winnipeg Zoning Bylaw The definitions of these terms do not specify the physical relationship between the two dwelling units in the building. In cities such as Buffalo, Detroit and Chicago the term Two-flat is used and defines it as a \\"residential building that contains 2 dwelling units located on a single lot. The dwelling units must share a common wall or common floor/ceiling.\\" Where cities do not define the relationship of the dwelling units to one another, units may be built one on top of the other, or one beside the other. The latter arrangement is more specifically referred to as a semi-detached building.

His extensive career as both director and actor in both film and theatre has been largely defined by his work and relationship with Artaud, Samuel Beckett and Jean Genet. In addition to being a close friend and confidant of Artaud during the latter's nine years of internment, he directed the first performances of Beckett's Waiting For Godot, Happy Days and Endgame as well as directing the initial performance of Genet's The Blacks and the controversial The Screens. Genet's key correspondences to Blin have been published by Editions Gallimard. The 1986 Faber and Faber publication, \\"Samuel Beckett: The Complete Dramatic Works\\" carries only three dedications from Beckett: \\"Endgame\\" is dedicated to Blin, while \\"Come and Go\\" is for John Calder, and \\"Catastrophe\\" is for V√°clav Havel.

Goals  The goal of XA is to guarantee atomicity in \\"global transactions\\" that are executed across heterogeneous components. A transaction is a unit of work such as transferring money from one person to another. Distributed transactions update multiple data stores (such as databases, application servers, message queues, transactional caches, etc.) To guarantee integrity, XA uses a two-phase commit (2PC) to ensure that all of a transaction's changes either take effect (commit) or do not (roll back), i.e., atomically.  Architecture  Specifically, XA describes the interface between a global transaction manager and a specific application. An application that wants to use XA engages an XA transaction manager using a library or separate service. The transaction manager tracks the participants in the transaction (i.e. the various data stores to which the application writes), and works with them to carry out the two-phase commit. In other words, the XA transaction manager is separate from an application's interactions with servers. XA maintains a log of its decisions to commit or roll back, which it can use to recover in case of a system outage. Many software vendors support XA (meaning the software can participate in XA transactions), including a variety of relational databases and message brokers. Advantages and Disadvantages Since XA uses two-phase commit, the advantages and disadvantages of that protocol generally apply to XA. The main advantage is that XA (using 2PC) allows an atomic transaction across multiple heterogeneous technologies (e.g. a single transaction could encompass multiple databases from different vendors as well as an email server and a message broker), whereas traditional database transactions are limited to a single database. The main disadvantage is that 2PC is a blocking protocol: the other servers need to wait for the transaction manager to issue a decision about whether to commit or abort each transaction. If the transaction manager goes offline while transactions are waiting for its final decision, they will be stuck and hold their database locks until the transaction manager comes online again and issues its decision. This extended holding of locks may be disruptive to other applications that are using the same databases. Moreover, if the transaction manager crashes and its record of decisions cannot be recovered (e.g. due to a bug in how the decisions were logged, or due to data corruption on the server), manual intervention may be necessary. Many XA implementations provide an \\"escape hatch\\" for transactions to independently decide whether to commit or abort (without waiting to hear from the transaction manager), but this risks violating the atomicity guarantee and is therefore reserved for emergencies. Specification The XA specification describes what a resource manager must do to support transactional access. Resource managers that follow this specification are said to be XA-compliant. The XA specification was based on an interface used in the Tuxedo system developed in the 1980s, but adopted by several systems since then.

She was also famous for her aphorisms.–§–∞–∏–Ω–∞ –†–∞–Ω–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è: –ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å –±–µ–∑ –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ She acted in plays by Anton Chekhov, Aleksandr Ostrovsky, Maxim Gorky, Ivan Krylov, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, and others. Unfortunately, our judgement of her theater performances must come mostly from photos as only her three final performances of Make Way for Tomorrow by Vina Delmar, Truth is Good, but Happiness is Better by Aleksandr Ostrovsky, The Curious Savage by John Patrick were filmed. Faina Ranevskaya is more known to a wide audience as a cinema actress by her performance in such films as Pyshka (Boule de Suif), The Man in a Shell, Mechta (Dream), Vesna (Springtime), Cinderella, Elephant and String and many more.  Biography  Birthplace of Faina Ranevskaya in Taganrog She was born as Faina Feldman (–§–µ–ª—å–¥–º–∞–Ω) to a wealthy Jewish family in the city of Taganrog. Her father, Girsch Haimovich Feldman, owned a dry-ink factory, several buildings, a shop and the steamboat \\"Saint Nicolas\\". He was the head of Taganrog synagogue and a founder of a Jewish asylum for the aged. Faina's mother, Milka Rafailovna (n√©e Zagovaylova), was a great admirer of literature and art. That and her passion for Chekhov influenced Faina's love of art, poetry, music, and theater. There were three other children in the family - two brothers and an older sister named Bella. Faina Feldman attended the elementary school classes at the Mariinskaya Gymnasium for Girls, and then received regular home education. She was given music, singing, foreign languages lessons. Faina loved reading. Ranevskaya as Zinka in Alexander Tairov's theatrical production of the Sonate path√©tique (1931). Her passion for theater began when she was 14. Her attendance of Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard at the Moscow Art Theater was an experience that had great impact on her. Her pseudonym \\"Ranevskaya,\\" which later became her official surname, also came from that theater visit. In 1915 she left Taganrog for Moscow to pursue a career in the theater. Faina became estranged from her family over her choice of career, which they apparently rejected. She started as an extra actor in crowd or background scenes at the Summer Theater in Malakhovka near Moscow in 1915, where she also had a dacha. The Feldman family emigrated in 1917, but Faina decided to stay and continued her acting career, working in the theaters of Kerch, Rostov on Don, at the mobile theater \\"The First Soviet Theater\\" in Crimea, also in Baku, Arkhangelsk, Smolensk and other cities. In 1931 Ranevskaya acted at the Chamber Theater. The film Pyshka (known as Boule de Suif in the U.S.), directed by Mikhail Romm, marked her debut as a film actress in 1934. It was a silent black and white film based on the novel Boule de Suif by Guy de Maupassant, in which she starred as Madame Loiseau. Although the film was silent, Ranevskaya learned several sayings of Madame Loiseau in French from the original novel by Maupassant. Romain Rolland, a French writer who visited the Soviet Union in the 1930s, loved the film, and his favorite actor in the movie was Faina Ranevskaya. left At his request, the Pyshka (Boule de Suif) was shown in French cinemas, where it became a box-office success. Ranevskaya played on stage of the Central Academic Theatre of the Russian Army (1935-1939), Drama Theater, now Mayakovsky Theater (1943-1949), Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre (1955-1963), and finally Mossovet Theater (1949-1955, 1963-1983), where she worked with Yury Zavadsky. The actress was awarded the Stalin Prize for outstanding creative achievements on stage in 1949, and in 1951 for her work in the film U nih est' Rodina (They Have Their Motherland), directed by Vladimir Legoshin and Alexandre Feinzimmer. In 1961 Faina Ranevskaya was awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR. The actress died in 1984 in Moscow and was buried at the Donskoe Cemetery. A memorial plate dedicated to Ranevskaya was placed on her birthhouse in the city of Taganrog on August 29, 1986. In 1992 British \\"Who's Who\\" encyclopedia named Ranevskaya among the world's Top Ten Actors of the 20th century. That was done despite the fact that the actress had never played a major part in a movie: all her roles were supporting ones. In a newspaper article, one of the Soviet movie industry apparatchiks explained her lack of main roles by Faina Ranevskaya's \\"typical Semitic\\" face features.¬´–ú–æ–π —Å–µ—Ä–µ–±—Ä—è–Ω—ã–π —à–∞—Ä. –§–∞–∏–Ω–∞ –†–∞–Ω–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è¬ª On May 16, 2008, a Ranevskaya Monument was inaugurated in Taganrog in front of actress's birth house on Ulitsa Frunze 10 within the framework of the International Ranevskaya Theater Festival \\"The Great Province\\"* https://taganrogcity.com/pr_05162008.html Monument to Ranevskaya Inaugurated in Taganrog https://taganrogcity.com/pr_04162008.html First International Ranevskaya Drama Festival \\"The Great Province\\".

It is the headquarters of the Kissi Teng Chiefdom. 1991-2002 civil war During the Sierra Leone Civil War Revolutionary United Front (RUF) forces with support of the Liberian NPFL captured Kangama on 6 April 1991, after a failed Sierra Leone Army (SLA) attempt to secure the Kailahun District. They immediately displaced the local chieftain, looting and burning his house. The RUF conscript the local youth into the army, both boys and girls, and a number of wealthy citizens were executed. From Kangama the RUF/NPFL forces launched an attack on Buedu, leaving Kangama in their rear. By January 1992 the RUF had completely pacified the district and the local conscripts had returned from training to help maintain order. However, in February 1992, SLA forces briefly took Kangama, causing much destruction, but the RUF quickly responded and retook the town. In Spring 1993 the SLA began a new offensive and captured Kangama in June of that year. Many individuals, whether they'd actively collaborated with the RUF forces or not, fled to Liberia and Guinea. When SLA troops left Kangama in late 1993, the RUF and others returned. The RUF began a guerrilla war in the district, and Kangama quickly returned to RUF control. The SLA again briefly took Kangama toward the end of 1994, but it was back in RUF control by December. where it remained until May 1998. Kangama did not take part in the February 1995 elections. In March 1996 the RUF opened the school at Kangama, paying the teachers in foodstuffs. In March 1998, the head of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council that had briefly ruled Sierra Leone escaped to Kangama when Freetown fell. In May 1998, ECOMOG forces took Kangama, but the RUF continued guerrilla warfare in the area, and Kangama was soon back in RUF hands. When the Lome Peace Accord was signed in 1999 the RUF in the Kangama area did not disarm. Some retreated into Liberia, others into the bush. It was not until December 2001 and January 2002 that the RUF in Kangama finally surrendered their arms.

While the term quote specifically refers to the bid price or ask price of an instrument, it may be more generically used to relate to the last price which the security traded at (\\"last sale\\"). This may refer to both exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial instruments. Bid and ask The bid price (also known as the buy price) and the ask price (also known as the sell price) of a security are the prices (and often quantities) at which buyers and sellers are willing to purchase or sell that security. The bid shows the current price at which a buyer is willing to purchase shares, while the ask shows the current price at which they are willing to sell. The quantities at which these trades are placed are referred to as \\"bid size\\" and \\"ask size\\". For instance, if a trader submits a limit order to buy 1,000 shares of MSFT at $28.00, this order will appear in a market maker for MSFT's book with a bid of $28.00 and a bid size of 1000. The difference between the bid and ask price is known as the bid‚Äìask spread. Equities =Level 1 Access= Level 1 quotations represent realtime bid/ask data, the most commonly displayed market data. Level-1 data typically will display the Best- Bid-Offer (\\"BBO\\" or \\"Inside Quote\\"), i.e., the lowest ask and highest bid available at the time. =Level 2 Access= Level 2 data displays the best bid and ask prices (also known as \\"top-of-book\\") for each market participant in a given security. In other words, at a given time there may be several market makers participating in trade matching for a specific stock. Level 2 data will display the highest bid and lowest ask for each individual market maker. Level 2 information is of interest to traders and brokers because it indicates the buying and selling pressure behind individual securities. Similar in format to live streaming share prices, a typical Level 2 screen is split in two vertical halves and will show orders on both the bid price of a security (left-hand side) and the offer price (right-hand side). On major, heavily traded stocks the \\"depth\\" of the orders can quite often be in excess of 20/30 orders to both buy and sell at lower (left) and higher (right) prices. Traders can use this information to predict the short-term movement of a share or security in conjunction with volume traded, and attempt to profit from this information, which is usually legal as the information is in the public domain. The reason for this is that market makers sit ‚Äúbehind‚Äù such a screen by being obliged to both buy and sell the share at the posted price up to what is known as normal market size. For certain market centers such as NASDAQ, a full depth-of-book (DOB) is available, whereby every quotation for every market participant is displayed. =UK Level 2= The stock exchange electronic trading system (SETS) is an electronic order-driven system for trading the UK bluechip stocks including FTSE 100 and FTSEurofirst 300 stocks. The SETS order book matches buy and sell orders on a price/time priority. On SEAQ, all buys and sells go through a market maker who acts as an intermediary. The basis of SETS is that it directly matches willing buyers and sellers, creating efficiency in the markets by doing away with the intermediary of the market maker. This efficiency is true while the SETS system is populated by the most liquid and heavily traded stocks, but if matched bargains operate on less liquid stocks, waiting for a buyer to match with a seller could take hours, days or weeks. Because of the efficiency of the SETS system stocks traded tend to have narrow spreads so the cost of entry and exit from a position is much smaller. As an individual investor, should you wish to buy or sell a SETS stock, your broker will invariably still trade through a market maker, who will not display separate prices but simply use the SETS Level 2 screen to indicate where the market lies.

It depicts the murder of Thomas Arden by his wife Alice Arden and her lover, and their subsequent discovery and punishment. The play is notable as perhaps the earliest surviving example of domestic tragedy, a form of Renaissance play which dramatized recent and local crimes rather than far-off and historical events. The author is unknown, and the play has been attributed to Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe, and William Shakespeare, solely or collaboratively, forming part of the Shakespeare Apocrypha. The use of computerized stylometrics has kindled academic interest in determining the authorship. The 2016 edition of The Oxford Shakespeare attributes the play to Shakespeare together with an anonymous collaborator, and rejects the possibility of authorship by Kyd or Marlowe. It has also been suggested that it may be the work of Thomas Watson with contributions by Shakespeare. Sources Arden‚Äôs House in Faversham Thomas Arden, or Arderne, was a successful businessman in the early Tudor period. Born in 1508, probably in Norwich, Arden took advantage of the tumult of the Reformation to make his fortune, trading in the former monastic properties dissolved by Henry VIII in 1538. In fact, the house in which he was murdered (which is still standing in Faversham) was a former guest house of Faversham Abbey, the Benedictine abbey near the town. His wife Alice had taken a lover, a man of low status named Mosby; together, they plotted to murder her husband. After several bungled attempts on his life, two ex-soldiers from the former English dominion of Calais known as Black Will and Shakebag were hired and continued to make botched attempts.Raphael Holinshed, Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland, p. 1027 Arden was finally killed in his own home on 14 February 1551, and his body was left out in a field during a snowstorm, in the hope that the blame would fall on someone who had come to Faversham for the St Valentine's Day fair. The snowfall stopped, however, before the killers' tracks were covered, and the tracks were followed back to the house. Bloodstained swabs and rushes were found, and the killers quickly confessed. Alice and Mosby were put on trial and convicted of the crime; he was hanged and she burnt at the stake in 1551. Black Will may also have been burnt at the stake after he had fled to Flanders: the English records state he was executed in Flanders, while the Flemish records state he was extradited to England. Shakebag escaped and was never heard of again. Other conspirators were executed and hanged in chains. One ‚Äì George Bradshaw, who was implicated by an obscure passage in a sealed letter he had delivered ‚Äì was wrongly convicted and posthumously acquitted. The story would most likely have been known to Elizabethan readers through the account in Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles, although the murder was so notorious that it is also possible that it was in the living memory of some of the anonymous playwright's acquaintances. Both the play and the story in Holinshed's Chronicles were later adapted into a broadside ballad, \\"The complaint and lamentation of Mistresse Arden of Feversham in Kent\\".Facsimiles and recordings of the ballad can be found on the English Broadside Ballad Archive.

Alice is shown to believe love transcends social class. * Mosby: Alice's lover, whom Thomas Arden frequently belittles for being a tailor. His sister, Susan, serves Alice as a maid. * Michael: The Ardens' butler-like servant. He becomes a pawn in the murder plot after he is promised Susan's hand in marriage. * Black Will and Shakebag: Murderers hired by Alice's trusted accomplice Green. Various complications foil several of their attempts to kill Arden. Shakebag is shown to be the more evil of the two. * Franklin: Thomas Arden's best friend and traveling companion. On the road from London, he tells a tale of female infidelity. (Franklin has no real-life parallel and is purely a literary invention.) Text, history and authorship The play was printed anonymously in three quarto editions during the period, in 1592 (Q1), 1599 (Q2), and 1633 (Q3). The last publication occurred in the same year as a broadsheet ballad written from Alice's point of view. The title pages do not indicate performance or company. However, the play was never fully forgotten. For most of three centuries, it was performed in George Lillo's adaptation; the original was brought back to the stage in 1921, and has received intermittent revivals since. It was adapted into a ballet at Sadler's Wells in 1799, and into an opera, Arden Must Die, by Alexander Goehr, in 1967. In 1656 it appeared in a catalogue (An Exact and perfect Catalogue of all Plaies that were ever printed) with apparent mislineation. It has been argued that attributions were shifted up one line; if this is true, the catalogue would have attributed Arden to Shakespeare.W. W. Greg, \\"Shakespeare and Arden of Feversham\\", The Review of English Studies, 1945, os- XXI(82):134‚Äì136. The question of the text's authorship has been analyzed at length, but with no decisive conclusions. Claims that Shakespeare wrote the play were first made in 1770 by the Faversham antiquarian Edward Jacob. Others have also attributed the play to Shakespeare, for instance Algernon Charles Swinburne, George Saintsbury, and the nineteenth-century critics Charles Knight and Nicolaus Delius. These claims are based on evaluations of literary style and parallel passages. Christopher Marlowe has also been advanced as an author or co-author. The strong emotions of the characters and the lack of a virtuous hero are certainly in line with Marlowe's practice. Moreover, Marlowe was raised in nearby Canterbury and is likely to have had the knowledge of the area evinced by the play. Another candidate, favored by critics F. G. Fleay, Charles Crawford, H. Dugdale Sykes, and Brian Vickers, is Thomas Kyd, who at one time shared rooms with Marlowe. Debates about the play's authorship involve the questions of: (a) whether the text was generated largely by a single writer; and (b) which writer or writers may have been responsible for the whole or parts. In 2006, a new computer analysis of the play and comparison with the Shakespeare corpus by Arthur Kinney, of the Massachusetts Center for Renaissance Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the United States, and Hugh Craig, director of the Centre for Linguistic Stylistics at the University of Newcastle in Australia, found that word frequency and other vocabulary choices were consistent with the middle portion of the play (scenes 4‚Äì9) having been written by Shakespeare.Craig H., Kinney, A., Shakespeare, Computers, and the Mystery of Authorship, Cambridge University Press, 2012, pp. 78‚Äì99. This was countered in 2008, when Brian Vickers reported in the Times Literary Supplement that his own computer analysis, based on recurring collocations, indicates Thomas Kyd as the likely author of the whole.Brian Vickers, \\"Thomas Kyd, Secret Sharer\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 18 April 2008, pp. 13‚Äì15. In a study published in 2015, MacDonald P. Jackson set out an extensive case for Shakespeare's hand in the middle scenes of Arden, along with selected passages from earlier in the play. In 2013 the RSC published an edition attributing the play, in part, to William Shakespeare. Shakespeare had an ancestor named Thomas Arden on his mother's side, but he died in 1546 (four years prior to the Thomas Arden in the play) in Evenley, Rutland. Modern performance * In 1955 the play was performed by Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop at the Paris International Festival of Theatre as the English entry. * In 1970 Buzz Goodbody directed a version for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), with Emrys James as Arden and Dorothy Tutin as Alice, at The Roundhouse. * In 1982 Terry Hands directed the work, with Bruce Purchase and Jenny Agutter, at the RSC's Other Place theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. * In 2001 the play was performed for a summer season in the garden of Arden's house in Faversham, the scene of the murder. * In 2004, the play was performed by the Metropolitan Playhouse of New York. * In 2010 the play was performed at the Rose Theatre in Bankside by Em-lou productions. Directed by Peter Darney, it was its first London run for a decade. * In 2014, the Royal Shakespeare Company performed a production of the play; it ran at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. * In 2015, the play was performed by the Brave Spirits Theatre at Atlas Performing Arts Center. * In 2015, the play received a new interpretation by the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey as it was moved from the 1500s to the 1950s as part of their Shakespeare in the parks series. The production was notable for matching the farcical plot with 1950s pop songs by Sinatra, Elvis, Patsy Cline, and Fats Domino and making Arden's friend Franklin a woman, playing up sexual subtext inherent in their scenes. * In May 2018, Maiden Thought Theatre performed it in their home town of Bremen (Germany), setting it to original music by Frances Byrd as a homage to the genre of Film Noir, playing out more of the comedic elements of the play. They, too, changed the role of Franklin to a female \\"Frankie\\", while setting up Faversham (restoring the original spelling, \\"Feversham\\") as a morally and deeply corrupt society. * In 2019, the play was performed on BBC Radio 3 (UK) with Ewan Bailey as Arden and Amaka Okafor as Alice, adapted and directed by Alison Hindell.

For active tuberculosis, it is often used with rifampicin, isoniazid, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. It is not generally recommended for the treatment of latent tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pains, and rash. More serious side effects include gout, liver toxicity, and sensitivity to sunlight. It is not recommended in those with significant liver disease or porphyria. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe but it is likely okay during breastfeeding. Pyrazinamide is in the antimycobacterial class of medications. How it works is not entirely clear. Pyrazinamide was first made in 1936, but did not come into wide use until 1972. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Pyrazinamide is available as a generic medication.  Medical uses  Pyrazinamide is only used in combination with other drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and as directly observed therapy (DOT). It is never used on its own. It has no other indicated medical uses. In particular, it is not used to treat other mycobacteria; Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium leprae are innately resistant to pyrazinamide. Pyrazinamide is used in the first 2 months of treatment to reduce the duration of treatment required. Regimens not containing pyrazinamide must be taken for 9 months or more. Pyrazinamide is a potent antiuricosuric drug and consequently has an off-label use in the diagnosis of causes of hypouricemia and hyperuricosuria. It acts on URAT1.  Adverse effects  The most common (roughly 1%) side effect of pyrazinamide is joint pains (arthralgia), but this is not usually so severe that patients need to stop taking it. Pyrazinamide can precipitate gout flares by decreasing renal excretion of uric acid. The most dangerous side effect of pyrazinamide is hepatotoxicity, which is dose-related. The old dose for pyrazinamide was 40‚Äì70 mg/kg daily and the incidence of drug-induced hepatitis has fallen significantly since the recommended dose has been reduced to 12‚Äì30 mg/kg daily. In the standard four-drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol), pyrazinamide is the most common cause of drug-induced hepatitis. It is not possible to clinically distinguish pyrazinamide-induced hepatitis from hepatitis caused by isoniazid or rifampicin; test dosing is required (this is discussed in detail in tuberculosis treatment) Other side effects include nausea and vomiting, anorexia, sideroblastic anemia, skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, dysuria, interstitial nephritis, malaise, rarely porphyria, and fever.  Pharmacokinetics  Pyrazinamide is well absorbed orally. It crosses inflamed meninges and is an essential part of the treatment of tuberculous meningitis. It is metabolised by the liver and the metabolic products are excreted by the kidneys. Pyrazinamide is routinely used in pregnancy in the UK and the rest of the world; the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends its use in pregnancy; and extensive clinical experience shows that it is safe. In the US, pyrazinamide is not used in pregnancy, citing insufficient evidence of safety. Pyrazinamide is removed by haemodialysis, so doses should always be given at the end of a dialysis session.  Mechanism of action  Pyrazinamide is a prodrug that stops the growth of M. tuberculosis. Pyrazinamide diffuses into the granuloma of M. tuberculosis, where the tuberculosis enzyme pyrazinamidase converts pyrazinamide to the active form pyrazinoic acid. Under acidic conditions of pH 5 to 6, the pyrazinoic acid that slowly leaks out converts to the protonated conjugate acid, which is thought to diffuse easily back into the bacilli and accumulate. The net effect is that more pyrazinoic acid accumulates inside the bacillus at acid pH than at neutral pH. Pyrazinoic acid was thought to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is required by the bacterium to synthesize fatty acids although this has been discounted. The accumulation of pyrazinoic acid was also suggested to disrupt membrane potential and interfere with energy production, necessary for survival of M. tuberculosis at an acidic site of infection. However, since an acidic environment is not essential for pyrazinamide susceptibility and pyrazinamide treatment does not lead to intrabacterial acidification nor rapid disruption of membrane potential, this model has also been discounted. Pyrazinoic acid was proposed to bind to the ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) and inhibit trans-translation, but more detailed experiments have shown that it does not have this activity. = Resistance = Mutations in the pncA gene of M. tuberculosis, which encodes a pyrazinamidase and converts pyrazinamide to its active form pyrazinoic acid, are responsible for the majority of pyrazinamide resistance in M. tuberculosis strains. A few pyrazinamide- resistant strains with mutations in the rpsA gene have also been identified. However, a direct association between these rpsA mutations and pyrazinamide resistance has not been established. The pyrazinamide-resistant M. tuberculosis strain DHMH444, which harbors a mutation in the carboxy terminal coding region of rpsA, is fully susceptible to pyrazinoic acid and pyrazinamide resistance of this strain was previously associated with decreased pyrazinamidase activity. Further, this strain was found to be susceptible to pyrazinamide in a mouse model of tuberculosis. Thus, current data indicate that rpsA mutations are not likely to be associated with pyrazinamide resistance. Currently, three main methods of testing are used for pyrazinamide resistance: 1) phenotypic tests where a tuberculosis strain is grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of pyrazinamide, 2) measuring levels of pyrazinamidase enzyme produced by the tuberculosis strain, or 3) looking for mutations in the pncA gene of tuberculosis. Concerns exist that the most widely used method for phenotypic resistance testing may overestimate the number of resistant strains. Global resistance of tuberculosis to pyrazinamide has been estimated to be in 16% of all cases, and 60% of people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.  Abbreviations  The abbreviations PZA and Z are standard, and used commonly in the medical literature, although best practice discourages the abbreviating of drug names to prevent mistakes.  Presentation  Pyrazinamide is a generic drug, and is available in a wide variety of presentations. Pyrazinamide tablets form the bulkiest part of the standard tuberculosis treatment regimen. Pyrazinamide tablets are so large, some people find them impossible to swallow: pyrazinamide syrup is an option. Pyrazinamide is also available as part of fixed-dose combinations with other TB drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin (Rifater is an example).  History  Pyrazinamide was first discovered and patented in 1936, but not used against tuberculosis until 1952. Its discovery as an antitubercular agent was remarkable since it has no activity against tuberculosis in vitro, due to not being active at a neutral pH, so would ordinarily not be expected to work in vivo. However, nicotinamide was known to have activity against tuberculosis and pyrazinamide was thought to have a similar effect. Experiments in mice at Lederle and Merck confirmed its ability to kill tuberculosis and it was rapidly used in humans.

In 1983, IBM introduced 31-bit addressing in the System/370-XA mainframe architecture as an upgrade to the 24-bit physical and virtual, and transitional 24-bit-virtual/26-bit physical,\\"with transitional support for 26-bit\\" addressing of earlier models. This enhancement allowed address spaces to be 128 times larger, permitting programs to address memory above 16 MB (referred to as \\"above the line\\").\\"...to run in the 31-bit area above the line,... Support for COBOL, FORTRAN and later on Linux/390 were included. In the early 1980s, the Motorola 68012 was introduced; it had 32-bit data and address registers, as the Motorola 68010 did, but instead of providing the lower 24 bits of an address on the address pins, it provided all but bit 30 on the address pins. 31-bit IBM mainframes =Architecture= In the System/360, other than the 360/67, and early System/370 architectures, the general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, the machine did 32-bit arithmetic operations, and addresses were always stored in 32-bit words, so the architecture was considered 32-bit, but the machines ignored the top 8 bits of the address resulting in 24-bit addressing. With the XA extension, only the high order bit (bit 0) in the word was ignored for addressing. An exception is that mode-switching instructions also used bit 0. There were at least two reasons that IBM did not implement the 32-bit addressing of the 360/67 # The loop control instructions BXH and BXLE did signed comparisons. # Much of the existing software used bit 0 as an end-of- list indicator.\\"... the high order bit in the last fullword must be set to one to indicate the end of the list.\\" =Transition= The transition was tricky: assembly language programmers, including IBM's own operating systems architects and developers, had been using the spare byte at the top of addresses for flags for almost twenty years.Indeed, in a variable length parameter list of addresses, the last address entry traditionally had its most significant bit set to 1, whereas the other address entries were required to have their most significant bit set to 0. IBM chose to provide two forms of addressing to minimize the pain: if the most significant bit (bit 0) of a 32-bit address was on, the next 31 bits were interpreted as the virtual address. If the most significant bit was off, then only the lower 24 bits were treated as the virtual address (just as with pre-XA systems). Thus programs could continue using the seven low-order bits of the top byte for other purposes as long as they left the top bit off. The only programs requiring modification were those that set the top (leftmost) bit of a word containing an address. This also affected address comparisons: The leftmost bit of a word is also interpreted as a sign-bit in 2's complement arithmetic, indicating a negative number if bit 0 is on. Programs that use signed arithmetic comparison instructions could get reversed results. Two equivalent addresses could be compared as non-equal if one of them had the sign bit turned on even if the remaining bits were identical. Most of this was invisible to programmers using high-level languages like COBOL or FORTRAN,\\"to accommodate large arrays in FORTRAN.\\" and IBM aided the transition with dual mode hardware for a period of time. Certain machine instructions in this 31-bit addressing mode alter the addressing mode bit as a possibly intentional side effect. For example, the original subroutine call instructions BAL, Branch and Link, and its register- register equivalent, BALR, Branch and Link Register, store certain status information, the instruction length code,Because the instruction length code is 00b for a BALR and is 01b for a BAL, the high order bit is always guaranteed to be set to 0, thereby indicating 24-bit mode, for BALR and BAL on XA and later systems. the condition code and the program mask, in the top byte of the return address. A BAS, Branch and Save, instruction was added to allow 31-bit return addresses. BAS, and its register-register equivalent, BASR, Branch and Save Register, was part of the instruction set of the System/360 Model 67, which was the only System/360 model to allow addresses longer than 24 bits. These instructions were maintained, but were modified and extended for 31-bit addressing. Additional instructions in support of 24/31-bit addressing include two new register-register call/return instructions which also effect an addressing mode change (e.g. Branch and Save and Set Mode, BASSM,\\"BASSM (branch and save and set mode)\\" the 24/31 bit version of a call where the linkage address including the mode is saved and a branch is taken to an address in a possibly different mode, and BSM, Branch and Set Mode, the 24/31 bit version of a return, where the return is directly to the previously saved linkage address and in its previous mode). Taken together, BASSM and BSM allow 24-bit calls to 31-bit (and return to 24-bit), 31-bit calls to 24-bit (and return to 31-bit), 24-bit calls to 24-bit (and return to 24-bit) and 31-bit calls to 31-bit (and return to 31-bit). Like BALR 14,15 (the 24-bit- only form of a call), BASSM is used as BASSM 14,15, where the linkage address and mode are saved in register 14, and a branch is taken to the subroutine address and mode specified in register 15. Somewhat similarly to BCR 15,14 (the 24-bit-only form of an unconditional return), BSM is used as BSM 0,14, where 0 indicates that the current mode is not saved (the program is leaving the subroutine, anyway), and a return to the caller at the address and mode specified in register 14 is to be taken. Refer to IBM publication MVS/Extended Architecture System Programming Library: 31-Bit Addressing, GC28-1158-1, for extensive examples of the use of BAS, BASR, BASSM and BSM, in particular, pp. 29‚Äì30. =370/ESA architecture= In the 1990s IBM introduced 370/ESA architecture (later named 390/ESA and finally ESA/390 or System/390, in short S/390), completing the evolution to full 31-bit virtual addressing and keeping this addressing mode flag. These later architectures allow more than 2 GB of physical memory and allow multiple concurrent address spaces up to 2 GB each in size. As of mid-2006 there were too many programs unduly constrained by this multiple 31-bit addressing mode. =z/Architecture= IBM broke the 2 GB linear addressing barrier (\\"the bar\\") in 2000 with the introduction of the first 64-bit z/Architecture system, the IBM zSeries Model 900.\\"2-gigabyte address from the user private area is called the bar\\" Unlike the XA transition, z/Architecture does not reserve a top bit to identify earlier code. z/Architecture maintains compatibility with 24-bit and 31-bit code, even older code running concurrently with newer 64-bit code. =Linux/390= Since Linux/390 was first released for the existing 32-bit data/31-bit addressing hardware in 1999, initial mainframe Linux applications compiled in pre-z/Architecture mode are also limited to 31-bit addressing. This limitation disappeared with 64-bit hardware, 64-bit Linux on IBM Z, and 64-bit Linux applications. The 64-bit Linux distributions still run 32-bit data/31-bit addressing programs. IBM's 31-bit addressing allows 31-bit code to make use of additional memory. However, at any one instant, a maximum of 2 GB is in each working address space. For non-64-bit Linux on processors with 31-bit addressing, it is possible to assign memory above the 2 GB bar as a RAM disk. 31-bit Linux kernel (not user-space) support was removed in version 4.1. Ruby & Smalltalk Interpreters for Ruby & Smalltalk languages use the lowest bit to tell whether a value is an unboxed integer or not. This means that on 32-bit machines (or 16-bit machines with 32-bit pointers), 31-bit integers are unboxed. In case of overflow, the result is fit into a boxed object, which means that it has to be allocated and garbage-collected. Thus if you have 32-bit values that don't fit in the 31-bit signed format, they will be very inefficient in those interpreters. Same goes with 63-bit unboxed integers on 64-bit computers. Similar designs may be found in LISP and some of the other languages whose variables can take values of any type. In some cases, there was hardware support for this kind of design: see Tagged architecture and Lisp machine.

The early 1980s saw the first popular personal computers, including the IBM PC/AT with an Intel 80286 processor using 24-bit addressing and 16-bit general registers and arithmetic, and the Apple Macintosh 128K with a Motorola 68000 processor featuring 24-bit addressing and 32-bit registers. The eZ80 is a microprocessor and microcontroller family, with 24-bit registers and therefore 24-bit linear addressing, that is binary compatible with the 8/16-bit Z80. The 65816 is a microprocessor and microcontroller family with 16-bit registers and 24-bit bank switched addressing. It is binary compatible with the 8-bit 6502. Several fixed-point digital signal processors have a 24-bit data bus, selected as the basic word length because it gave the system a reasonable precision for the processing audio (sound). In particular, the Motorola 56000 series has three parallel 24-bit data buses, one connected to each memory space: program memory, data memory X, and data memory Y. Engineering Research Associates (later merged into UNIVAC) designed a series of 24-bit drum memory machines including the Atlas, its commercial version the UNIVAC 1101, the ATHENA computer, the UNIVAC 1824 guidance computer, etc. Those designers selected a 24-bit word length because the Earth is roughly 40 million feet in diameter, and an intercontinental ballistic missile guidance computer needs to do the Earth-centered inertial navigation calculations to an accuracy of a few feet.

Armstrong, Ingrid J. Peterson, Phyllis Zagano, 2010, page 51.  Beginnings of the monastery  Radio Niepokalan√≥w house Museum of St Maximilian In 1927 Prince Jan Drucki-Lubecki offered Fr. Maximilian Kolbe a convenient ground near Warsaw for building a new monastery, later called Niepokalan√≥w. In autumn of the same year the first wooden barracks were built and a consecration of the new monastery took place on 7 December 1927. The facility served as a home for the Conventual brothers, a minor seminary and a volunteer fire department. It was also a centre for charitable ministry and evangelization through the radio programmes and the distribution of printed materials. In 1930 Father Kolbe founded a similar community in Nagasaki (Japan), called Mugenzai no Sono (ÁÑ°ÂéüÁΩ™„ÅÆÂúí:Garden of the Immaculate). Quick growth of the Niepokalan√≥w required more and more space, so the area of the monastery reached 28 ha. Before the Second World War broke out, it was the largest monastery in the world, housing as many as 760 men. One of the magazines, The Knight of the Immaculate, countered religious apathy and had a press run of 750,000 copies a month. The whole publishing house used about 1600 tonnes of paper annually for about 60 million copies of papers.History of Niepokalan√≥w - the beginnings of the monastery (official site of Niepokalan√≥w, English version)  The time of war  During the Second World War, the monastery provided shelter for many soldiers, injured in the September Campaign and also for refugees, regardless of their nationality or religion (e. g. to approximately 1,500 Jewish refugees from western Poland).Mary's Knight. The Mission and Martyrdom of Saint Maksymilian Maria Kolbe, by Claude R. Foster. West Chester University Press, West Chester - Pennsylvania 2002, page 586, 587, 592. Father Maximilian Kolbe, together with four other Franciscans, was arrested by Gestapo and he died in Auschwitz concentration camp in 1941. In the end of the war (January 1945) during heavy bombardment of Niepokalan√≥w, six friars were killed, some others injured and many of the buildings of the monastery were destroyed. That time the media evangelisation was forbidden (with the only one exception - December 1940 issue of \\"Rycerz Niepokalanej\\", which aroused the hope of surviving dark time of war). So the Franciscans tried to keep up common prayers and help for the prisoners and numerous refugees. The monastery lake Parish house in Niepokalan√≥w There was a sawmill, carpentry and dairy, a repair shop for farm machinery, bicycles, watches and many other items. The friars grew their own food, they had livestock, bee hives and chickens. The courses of secret teaching were also held and PCK (Polish Red Cross) circle functioned.  Nowadays. The pilgrimages  After the war the printing house in Niepokalan√≥w was reopened and The Knight of the Immaculate was issued again. In 1948-1954 there was built a new church, since April 1980 called basilica minor. Ioannis Paulus PP II Letterae Apostolicae Amor Noster (subtitle: In loco Niepokalan√≥w, qui est in Polonia, templum B.V.M. Immaculatae, Mediatricis omnium gratiarum, ad dignitatem basilicae minoris evehitur) - the Apostolic Letter of John Paul II, April 1980 In June 1950, according to the decree of Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, a new parish in Niepokalan√≥w was established (6500 faithful circa). The church and the monastery were visited by Pope John Paul II during his second Pastoral Visit in Poland, on 18 of June 1983. The visit of the Pope made Niepokalan√≥w famous not only in Poland, but also abroad. The Pope called the monastery a heroic place where saint Maximilian lived and the environment of the Immaculate. Many pilgrims want to visit the place, sacred by activity of St Maximilian, and pray in the local basilica. They also can see the Museum of St Maximilian (called There was a Man), established in 1998, and a wooden old chapel, one of the first buildings here, constructed in 1927 for the friars and rebuilt two years later so the local faithful could attend the celebrations and services. The monastery became also a place where many religious meeting are held.Niepokalan√≥w. Pilgrimage and tourist guide, by Fr. Roman Soczewka OFMConv. Wydawnictwo ZET, Wroc≈Çaw 2004, page 4, 6, 21, 42.

Famous for the homonymous forest, until 2001 administrative reform it was part of the former district of Wilmersdorf. Geography The locality is situated in the western side of the city and is separated from Spandau by the river Havel. It borders with the localities of Westend, Halensee, Schmargendorf, Wilhelmstadt, Gatow (both in Spandau district), Nikolassee, Zehlendorf and Dahlem (all three in Steglitz-Zehlendorf district). The Grunewald forest is 10 km away from Berlin-Mitte (Germany's capital). History =Origin of the name= The name derives from the Grunewald hunting lodge of 1543, the oldest preserved castle in Berlin, which is, however, officially located on the grounds of the adjacent Dahlem locality. It was erected in an Early Renaissance style by order of Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg and named Zum Gruenen Wald, the umlaut spelt with a following instead of a diacritic as depicted above the main entrance. A corduroy road leading from the Berlin Stadtschloss to the lodge was laid out, which later would be known as the Kurf√ºrstendamm boulevard. =Overview= Grunewald hunting lodge, oil on canvas, Wilhelm Barth, 1832 The neighbourhood developed out of a so-called \\"mansion colony\\" at the western end of the Kurf√ºrstendamm. Promoted by Otto von Bismarck the upper class of Berlin from 1880 on discovered Grunewald as an attractive site for living, which was incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920. Today, the social structure of Grunewald is still influenced by these origins. The Rot-Weiss Tennis Club, home of the WTA Tour German Open, has been located in the district since 1897. On June 24, 1922 Foreign Minister of Germany Walther Rathenau was assassinated by ultra-nationalist radicals of the Organisation Consul in a curve of the main street called Koenigsallee. A memorial stone marks the scene of the crime. Since 1981 the Grunewald district is the home of the Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin. It also houses the embassies of Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Qatar, Kuwait, Laos, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Poland, Serbia and Turkey. Within the Grunewald forest is the artificial Teufelsberg hill, once a listening station of the US National Security Agency. At the shore of the Havel the Grunewaldturm, built by Franz Heinrich Schwechten in 1898, offers panoramic views of the Havelland region. =The Deportation Memorial= Memorial plaque, Berlin-Grunewald station Between October 1941 and February 1945 more than 50,000 Jews were deported by German Nazis to extermination camps from the Grunewald freight railway station and murdered. Nowadays, memorials from the district of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf and the Deutsche Bahn (\\"Gleis 17\\") commemorate this dark spot in Grunewald's history. The area is accessible by the Berlin-Grunewald station.

Scandinavian clans dominated the area from the 8th century CE, using the islands as a base for further incursions. In the late 14th century the archipelago became part of Scotland. Prehistoric Orkney Neolithic dwellings at Skara Brae, Orkney As with Prehistoric Scotland generally, hunter gatherers followed the slow retreat of ice age glaciation. The rapid spread of Neolithic culture up the western seaways soon brought early farming settlements and Megalithic culture. The prevalent use of the local sandstone, found ready split into convenient building slabs on the shore, preserved numerous structures from this period, including prehistoric villages, brochs, souterrain structures, chambered cairns and standing stones. The oldest stone house still standing in northern Europe (occupied from 3500 BC to 3100 BC) is at Knap of Howar on the island of Papa Westray, with walls intact to a low eaves height, and stone furniture looking very usable. Finely made and decorated Unstan ware pottery links the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby. At Skara Brae on the Mainland, passageways connect similar houses into a village, dating from about 3000 BC to 2500 BC. Pottery found here is of the grooved ware style which was found at the Standing Stones of Stenness, close to the exceptional Maeshowe passage grave type chambered cairn of about the same period. The nearby Ring of Brodgar circle of standing stones was one of the first to be analysed by Professor Alexander Thom to establish the likely use of standing stones as astronomical observatories. Another Neolithic village has been found in the vicinity at Barnhouse Settlement. The brochs of Orkney occur on several islands. Many of these structures, such as Burroughston Broch on Shapinsay, are isolated fortified houses. Others, such as the Broch of Gurness, are surrounded by numerous other dwellings and ancillary structures. In many cases the brochs also are surrounded by elaborate ditch and rampart defences. Both Burroughston BrochC. Michael Hogan, Burroughston Broch, The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham, Oct. 7, 2007 and the Broch of Gurness have interesting guard chambers within their thick drystone walls to monitor the single entrance passages. Iron Age The Iron Age brought impressive \\"Brochs\\" or round towers, and \\"weems\\" or underground houses. Such implements as have survived are primitive, and include quern- stones (for grinding grain), stone whorls and bone combs used in primitive forms of weaving, and specimens of simple pottery ware. Little is known of the culture and language of the early inhabitants. Only two languages are found in pre-Norse Orkney, Old Gaelic (Old Irish) and Latin. The Romans were aware of (and probably circumnavigated) the Orkney Islands, which they called \\"Orcades\\", thought to be a Brythonic Celtic name. A \\"king of the Orcades\\" was one of the 11 rulers said to have paid tribute to Claudius following his invasion of Britain in AD 43\\\\. Indeed 4th and 5th century sources include the Islands in a Roman province.Orcades/Orkney: the 6th roman province in Britannia Archaeological evidence suggests that the Romans only traded with the inhabitants, perhaps through intermediaries, no signs of clear occupation have been found. But, according to scholars like Montesanti, \\"Orkney might have been one of those areas that suggest direct administration by Imperial Roman procurators, at least for a very short span of time\\". Early medieval period The Picts regained power until dispossessed by the Norse in the 9th century, with the possible interruption of a short period towards the beginning of the 6th century, when D√°l Riata Gaels may have established a footing in the islands, followed by Celtic missionaries in about 565. They were companions of Saint Columba and their efforts to convert the folk to Christianity seem to have impressed the popular imagination, for the names of several islands include the epithet \\"Papa\\" in commemoration of the preachers old.Attribution? Norwegian rule Viking grave from Orkney reconstructed in the National Museum of Scotland Vikings having made the islands the headquarters of their aggressive expeditions (carried out indifferently against their own Norway and the coasts and isles of Scotland), Harold H√•rfagre (\\"Fair Hair\\") subdued the rovers in 875 and annexed both Orkney and Shetland to Norway. They remained under the rule of Norwegian earls until 1231, when the line of the jarls became extinct. In that year the earldom of Caithness was granted to Magnus, second son of the Earl of Angus, whom the king of Norway apparently confirmed in the title. Recent studies from the field of population genetics reveal a significant percentage of Norse ethnic heritage‚Äîup to one third of the Y chromosomes on the islands are from western Norwegian ancestry, as opposed to Shetland, where over half the male lineage is of Norwegian stock. Some jarls of Orkney: * Ragnvald Eysteinsson, d. c. 890 * Turf-Einar, d. c. 910 * Thorfinn Turf-Einarsson, Earl of Orkney, d. c. 963 * Erlend II * Hakon Paulsson, 1105‚Äì1123 * Saint Magnus, 1106‚Äì1117 There is a legend that Henry Sinclair, 1st Earl of Orkney may have sailed to Newfoundland in 1398, returning in 1400. Annexation by Scotland In 1468 Orkney and Shetland were pledged by Christian I, in his capacity as king of Norway, for the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret, betrothed to James III of Scotland, and as the money was never paid, their connection with the crown of Scotland has been perpetual.Acquisition of Orkney and Shetland 1468-9 In 1471 James bestowed the castle and lands of Ravenscraig in Fife on William, earl of Orkney, in exchange for all his rights to the earldom of Orkney, which, by act of parliament, passed on 20 February 1472, was annexed to the Scottish crown. The last full-scale battle to take place on Orkney soil‚Äîthe Battle of Summerdale‚Äîwas fought in 1529, between the Sinclairs of Orkney and the Sinclairs of Caithness. In 1564 Lord Robert Stewart, natural son of James V of Scotland, who had visited Kirkwall twenty-four years before, was made sheriff of Orkney and Shetland, and received possession of the estates of the udallers; in 1581 he was created earl of Orkney by James VI, the charter being ratified ten years later to his son Patrick, but after Patrick's execution in 1614 the earldom was again annexed to the crown. The islands were the rendezvous of the Marquess of Montrose's expedition in 1650 which culminated in his imprisonment and death. Cromwell was last attacked by a foreign conquering force prior to the union of Scotland and England in 1650. During the Protectorate they were visited by a detachment of Oliver Cromwell's troops, who attacked various locations with his English Navy and the Roundhead Army. It is claimed by sympathetic writers that he initiated the inhabitants into various industrial arts and new methods of agriculture. Re: St Magnus Cathedral..... \\"During Oliver Cromwell's siege of the cathedral in 1651, the building was damaged and then suffered for a time when it was used by Cromwell's Roundheads as a barracks and stable for their horses.\\" http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/stmagnus/magcath.htm In 1707 the islands were granted to the earl of Morton in mortgage, redeemable by the Crown on payment of 30,000 pounds, and subject to an annual feu-duty of 500 pounds; but in 1766 his estates were sold to Sir Lawrence Dundas, ancestor of the Earls of Zetland. Religion In early times, both the archbishop of Hamburg and the archbishop of York disputed with the Norwegians ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Orkney and the right of consecrating bishops; but ultimately the Norwegian bishops, the first of whom was William the Old (consecrated in 1102), continued the canonical succession. The see remained vacant from 1580 to 1606, and from 1638 till the Restoration, and, after the accession of William III, the episcopacy was finally abolished (1697), although many of the clergy refused to conform. The topography of Orkney is wholly Norse, and the Norse tongue which evolved into the local Norn, at last extinguished by the constant influx of settlers from Scotland, lingered until the end of the 18th century. Readers of Scott's Pirate will remember the frank contempt which Magnus Troil expressed for the Scots, and his opinions probably accurately reflected the general Norse feeling on the subject. When the islands were given as security for the princess's dowry, there seems reason to believe that it was intended to redeem the pledge, because it was then stipulated that the Norse system of government and the law of Saint Olaf should continue to be observed in Orkney and Shetland. Thus the udal succession and mode of land tenure (that is, absolute freehold as distinguished from feudal tenure) lingered to some extent, and the remaining udallers held their lands and passed them on without written title. Twentieth century The islands cluster round the huge deep-water anchorage of Scapa Flow like a protecting hand, and in both World War I and World War II, the Royal Navy had a major base there, enabling them to challenge any attempt by German warships to emerge into the ocean through the Norwegian Sea. After the Armistice in 1918, the German High Seas Fleet was transferred in its entirety to Scapa Flow while a decision was to be made on its future; however, the German sailors opened their sea-cocks and scuttled all the ships. Most ships were salvaged, but the remaining wrecks are now a favoured haunt of recreational divers.  Second World War  One month into World War II, the Royal Navy battleship HMS Royal Oak was sunk by a German U-boat in Scapa Flow. As a result, barriers were built to close most of the access channels; these had the additional advantage of creating causeways whereby travellers can go from island to island by road instead of being obliged to rely on boats. In the course of the Second World War Italian prisoners of war were kept on Orkney Mainland; they improvised a chapel with elaborate architecture out of corrugated iron and other base materials, which is now a tourist attraction. The Scapa Flow base was closed in 1956.James Miller, The North Atlantic Front: Orkney, Shetland, Faroe and Iceland at War (2004) Recent years In the 1960s and 1970s there were reportsSixth Report of the Highlands and Islands Development Board, 1971 about the potential for uranium mining between Stromness and Yesnaby. Margaret Thatcher's plans to open such a mine were halted in 1980 after local campaigning, which included production of The Yellow Cake Revue by composer and conductor Peter Maxwell Davies, who lived on the neighbouring island of Hoy. The title refers to yellowcake, the powder produced in an early stage of the processing of uranium ore. The Scottish independence referendum prompted some Orcadians to look for ways to recast the Constitutional status of Orkney. Legend In the Arthurian legend, Orkney is the home to King Lot, Sir Gareth, Sir Gaheris, Sir Gawaine, and Sir Agravain.

Lomen is situated in the traditional region of Valdres.  History  Lomen Stave Church was built in the second half of the 12th century. Through dendrochronological dating the church has been dated to 1192, but the first reference in written sources is not until 1325 and 1334, at that time as \\"Hvams kirke\\". The church was rebuilt and enlarged in 1749. The church is supported by 4 columns, and has three lavishly carved portals, chancel-arches and column capitals. During the last refurbishment of the church, an archaeological excavation was carried out and 71 artifacts were found, including pieces of jewelry and coins. Some of the coins were as old as the 12th century. Lomen Stave Church houses the pedestal of a baptismal font dating from the 1200s. Only the wall and roof timbers remain from the original stave church. The church is without electric light and heating, and it is only used for weddings and church services during the summer season.

In his youth he was hired at the Derrygonnelly Fair by a farmer who played the fiddle. It was from this farmer that he learned to play the instrument. He played in the 1930s and 1940s with local C√©il√≠ bands, the Sillees and the Knockmore C√©il√≠ Band. He lived most of his life in Blaney and played mainly in Derrygonnelly. Mick came from a musical family but stood out as the main talent with his huge repertoire of tunes and songs. His singing style was subtle with beautiful use of glottal stops and variations in phrasing. One of the finest fiddlers of his generation, his powerful style was an interesting blend of Northern and Southern elements. He had a stock of distinctly local tunes, many of which he got from his old friend, the great flute-player Eddie Duffy. In turn he passed his music on to fellow-musicians such as Cathal McConnell (of The Boys of the Lough), Altan, Seamus Quinn, Ben Lennon, Jim McGrath and others.

The commune is composed of three villages: Ant (Ant), Avram Iancu and TƒÉma»ôda (Tam√°shida). The majority of the population (96%) in Avram Iancu village is Romanian. Overall, the commune is 74.7% Romanian, 15.6% Roma and 9.6% Hungarian. The architecture of the commune is typical for a Romanian field village: the main street traverses the village, houses being equally distributed along it. Location Geographically, it is situated at the border of Bihor County with Arad County, and Hungary, at exactly the same distance (60 km) from the capital cities of the two counties, Oradea and Arad. The commune is crossed by the European road E671. The nearest city is Salonta, at 18 km. History The Monument of Avram Iancu The first official documentation of human settlement in the area dates back to 1169. The document mentions a very small village called Villa Tamasd, which in fact is the village TƒÉma≈üda, a component of the today commune. In the early 1600 the establishment was destroyed being caught in a battle between the Turkish and Hungarian armies. In 1700 the establishment and its surroundings were transformed in a fiefdom for a Hungarian noble. The today's village of Avram Iancu was founded, in the early 1900, by the Romanian colonists which came from the eastern region of Bihor county. They received here land from the King Ferdinand I of Romania the village being named Regina Maria after Ferdinand's wife Queen Marie. In 1956, under the Communist regime, it was renamed after the 1848 Revolution Romanian hero Avram Iancu. Economy Eggplant crop in Avram Iancu Due to its fertile lands Avram Iancu is one of the biggest producers of agricultural products (vegetables) within Bihor county, supplying the markets for the neighboring cities with fresh high-quality vegetable products. In the beginning (during the communist times), there were just a few households doing intensive production on very small surfaces of land. After 1989 the proportion of households employed in this activity boosted to over 80%, more than a half being specialized in extensive cultures on large areas of land.

However, in the context of decision trees, the term is sometimes used synonymously with mutual information, which is the conditional expected value of the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence of the univariate probability distribution of one variable from the conditional distribution of this variable given the other one. The information gain of a random variable X obtained from an observation of a random variable A taking value is defined IG_{X, A}{(X,a)} = D_\\\\text{KL}{\\\\left(P_X{(xa)} \\\\ P_X{(xI)}\\\\right)}, the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence of the prior distribution P_{X}{(xI)} for x from the posterior distribution P_{XA}{(xa)} for x given a. The expected value of the information gain is the mutual information of X and A ‚Äì i.e. the reduction in the entropy of X achieved by learning the state of the random variable A. In machine learning, this concept can be used to define a preferred sequence of attributes to investigate to most rapidly narrow down the state of X. Such a sequence (which depends on the outcome of the investigation of previous attributes at each stage) is called a decision tree and applied in the area of machine learning known as decision tree learning. Usually an attribute with high mutual information should be preferred to other attributes. General definition In general terms, the expected information gain is the change in information entropy from a prior state to a state that takes some information as given: : IG(T,a) = \\\\Eta{(T)} - \\\\Eta{(Ta)}, where \\\\Eta{(Ta)} is the conditional entropy of T given the value of attribute a . Formal definition Let T denote a set of training examples, each of the form (\\\\textbf{x},y) = (x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_k, y) where x_a\\\\in vals(a) is the value of the a^{\\\\text{th}} attribute or feature of example \\\\textbf{x} and is the corresponding class label. The information gain for an attribute a is defined in terms of Shannon entropy \\\\Eta( - ) as follows. For a value v taken by attribute a , let S_a{(v)} = {\\\\textbf{x}\\\\in Tx_a=v} be defined as the set of training inputs of T for which attribute a is equal to v . Then the information gain of T for attribute a is the difference between the a priori Shannon entropy \\\\Eta(T) of the training set and the conditional entropy \\\\Eta{(Ta)}. \\\\Eta(Ta)= \\\\sum_{v\\\\in vals(a)} {\\\\frac{S_a{(v)}}{T} \\\\cdot \\\\Eta\\\\left(S_a{\\\\left(v\\\\right)}\\\\right)}. :IG(T,a) = \\\\Eta(T) - \\\\Eta(Ta) The mutual information is equal to the total entropy for an attribute if for each of the attribute values a unique classification can be made for the result attribute. In this case, the relative entropies subtracted from the total entropy are 0. In particular, the values v \\\\in vals(a) defines a partition of the training set data T into mutually exclusive and all-inclusive subsets, inducing a categorical probability distribution P_{a}{(v)} on the values v \\\\in vals(a) of attribute a. The distribution is given P_{a}{(v)} := \\\\frac{S_a{(v)}}{T}. In this representation, the information gain of T given a can be defined as the difference between the unconditional Shannon entropy of T and the expected entropy of T conditioned on a, where the expectation value is taken with respect to the induced distribution on the values of a.\\\\begin{alignat}{2} IG(T,a) &= \\\\Eta(T) - \\\\sum_{v\\\\in vals(a)} {P_a{(v)} \\\\Eta\\\\left(S_a{(v)}\\\\right)} \\\\ &= \\\\Eta(T) - \\\\mathbb{E}_{P_a}{\\\\left[\\\\Eta{(S_a{(v)})}\\\\right]} \\\\ &= \\\\Eta(T) - \\\\Eta{(Ta)}. \\\\end{alignat} Drawbacks Although information gain is usually a good measure for deciding the relevance of an attribute, it is not perfect. A notable problem occurs when information gain is applied to attributes that can take on a large number of distinct values. For example, suppose that one is building a decision tree for some data describing the customers of a business. Information gain is often used to decide which of the attributes are the most relevant, so they can be tested near the root of the tree. One of the input attributes might be the customer's credit card number. This attribute has a high mutual information, because it uniquely identifies each customer, but we do not want to include it in the decision tree: deciding how to treat a customer based on their credit card number is unlikely to generalize to customers we haven't seen before (overfitting). To counter this problem, Ross Quinlan proposed to instead choose the attribute with highest information gain ratio from among the attributes whose information gain is average or higher. This biases the decision tree against considering attributes with a large number of distinct values, while not giving an unfair advantage to attributes with very low information value, as the information value is higher or equal to the information gain.

Unlike fullerene, sumanene has benzyl positions which are available for organic reactions.  Organic synthesis  The structure of Sumanene can be inferred from oxidation of 1,5,9-trimethyltriphenylene but the first practical synthesis starts from norbornadiene.A Synthesis of Sumanene, a Fullerene Fragment Hidehiro Sakurai, Taro Daiko, and Toshikazu Hirao Science, Vol 301, Issue 5641, 1878 , 26 September 2003 Norbornadiene is converted into a stannane by action of n-butyllithium, dibromoethane and tributyltinchloride. An Ullmann reaction of this stannane with CuTC affords the benzene core. The methylene bridges (--) created in this conversion then migrate in a tandem ring-opening metathesis and ring-closing metathesis by the Grubbs' catalyst.

Sumanene also experiences bowl-to-bowl inversion with an inversion barrier of 19.6 kcal/mol (82 kJ/mol) at 140 ¬∞C which is much higher than that found for its corannulene cousin. Like any benzylic proton, the sumanene protons can be abstracted by a strong base such as t-butyl lithium to form the sumanene mono carbanion.

Kolbe presented the idea of forming the \\"Militia of the Immaculata\\" (or M.I.) to his Jesuit spiritual director, as well as to his Franciscan Superior at the house of studies in Rome, and was encouraged to proceed. The purpose of the M.I. is to draw souls back to the knowledge and importance of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and to how every soul can easily enter into this consoling mystery through their own personal Act of Consecration to the Immaculata. It was established as a pious union on January 2, 1922, by the Vicariate of Rome. Joining the MI involves making a personal act of consecration to Mary. Members wear the Miraculous Medal as an outward sign of their consecration. > The purpose of the Knights is contained in these words: to do all you can > for the conversion of sinners, heretics, schismatics and so on, above all > the Masons, and for the sanctification of all persons under the sponsorship > of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Immaculate Mediatrix.- Fr. Maximilian Kolbe, > 1938. The association grew and spread to different countries. On October 16, 1997, the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed the \\"Milizia dell'Immacolata\\" to be an international association of the faithful of pontifical right. M.I. has over 3 million members in 48 countries. The organization publishes Miles Immaculatae, a six-monthly magazine of Marian culture and Kolbian formation.

He competed for Ireland at four Summer Olympics. After Steve Scott and John Walker, he is the third all-time by total of sub-4 minute miles run over the course of his career, at 101. Running career Although he wasn't planning to go to any of Ireland's universities, O'Sullivan's running encouraged him to go to Villanova University at 19. While competing on a collegiate level, he worked towards a degree in accounting and later attained an MBA and a CPA. The three World Indoor 1500 metre Championships won by O'Sullivan were in 1987 (Indianapolis), 1989 (Budapest), and 1993 (Toronto). In his victories in 1987 and 1989, he set championship records. He was 4th in the 1991 Seville world indoor championships. At the 1985 European Athletics Indoor Championships, O'Sullivan won a silver medal in the 1500m. O'Sullivan qualified for four Olympic Games for Ireland: 1984, 1988, 1992, and 1996, at both 800 metres and 1500 metres. He reached the 1500 metre finals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. He set an indoor 1500 metres world record of 3:35.4 on 10 February 1989, and was generally regarded as a better competitor running indoors. This is evidenced by the fact that O'Sullivan won the prestigious Wanamaker Mile in Madison Square Garden's Millrose Games six times (1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1992, and 1996). His personal best for the mile, which was set indoors in 1988, is 3:50.94. His personal best for the 1500 metres, which was set outdoors in 1996, is 3:33.61. O'Sullivan, along with Irish runners Ray Flynn, Eamonn Coghlan, and Frank O'Mara established the still standing world record in the 4 x 1 mile relay, when they combined in Dublin on August 17, 1985 to run 15:49.08. O'Sullivan now runs the RunningWorks cross country camp during the summer, and is the head coach of Villanova cross country and track and field. He was coached by Tom Donnelly of Haverford College and advised Bob Kennedy in the later years before Kennedy's retirement. In addition to his ties to American record holder Bob Kennedy, O'Sullivan has coached elite professional runners such as Canadian indoor world silver medalist Carmen Douma-Hussar, and New Zealander Adrian Blincoe. He has a daughter named Laura O'Sullivan, who attends the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine and a son, Christopher O'Sullivan who attends Villanova University. He also runs a summer camp called Running Works, along with Cricket Batz. It takes place in Canadensis, PA, and is a one-week sleep away camp where High School cross-country runners stay in cabins.

He is best known for the Sunday night talk radio show Pete Price: Unzipped, which was broadcast across sister stations Radio City and Radio City Talk. The show aired live from 10pm to 2am and followed an open forum format. Price also had a weeknight phone in, Late Night City which aired live between 22.00h and 02.00h, from Monday to Thursday and was simulcast on Radio City Talk and Radio City 2. In 2017 Price announced that he was cutting back his show from 5 nights a week to just Sunday night. From 2017-2020 he hosted Pete Price‚Äôs Sunday Best at 10pm - 1am every Sunday, where his weekly phone in guest for the last 13 years had been Dr. Angie McCartney, step-mother to Sir Paul, who lives in Los Angeles and provided the show's Hollywood Gossip live from LA. Pete now broadcasts on Liverpool Live 24/7 every Sunday night at 10pm till 1am. As a comedian he was a winner on the ITV talent show, New Faces.Tony Bell, The Independent. I'm gay, and I don't need a psychiatrist, 24 Oct 1995. Accessed 14 April 2015. He is also an author, patron and artist for Claire House Children's Hospice and columnist for the Liverpool Echo. He is openly gay, which is often the subject of prank calls to his radio show. He is dyslexic and can have trouble reading texts or emails on air. To complement his radio show Price also gives out a personal phone number for listeners to talk to him in confidence. Early life Price was born in Wrexham, Wales, and adopted at approximately three months old in April 1946 by Hilda Sandra Price and David William Lloyd. He was raised in West Kirby, Cheshire, England. He was notably closer to his mother than his father, who repeatedly was violent towards Hilda Price. When he was twelve and a half he came to terms with his homosexuality, but when consulting his doctor he was told he'd \\"grow out of it\\". Two years later Price went back to the same doctor, only to be prescribed some Valium. A combination of his homosexuality, problems with school and problems socially put him into a state of despair. At the age of fourteen he attempted to overdose on child-strength aspirin, only to wake up the next morning. At fifteen Price was working as a hairdresser at the weekend whilst studying cookery at Birkenhead Technical College (now Wirral Metropolitan College). He began working for the wealthy Ward family, catering for their dinner parties, as well as being a close family friend. He soon got a professional catering job, a summer at the Cavendish Hotel in Eastbourne and went on to manage a Fullers Tea Shop in Worthing. Price was sent to an institution in Chester to receive aversion therapy when he came out to his mother at age eighteen. He left after one day after being exposed to people being \\"treated\\" using electrodes. A few days later he recognised one of the psychiatrists from the institution in a gay bar. In 1993, after stories had emerged of others being treated this way in hospitals, he decided to go public with his story, to encourage more people to come forward. Radio career Pete Price's Superlambanana After several years as the cook on a cruise ship, he became a disc jockey for BBC Radio Merseyside at the age of twenty-one. Shortly after, Price made his first appearance on the comedy scene at Liverpool's 'The Shakespeare', working at various venues which include The Palladium and the QE2. In the 1980s, he became a presenter on his former station's rival, 194 Radio City, and has remained so in its various incarnations since. He continues to star in pantomimes in Liverpool and Merseyside, as well as working for national newspapers including The Independent and The Times. As a broadcaster he has worked with national BBC Radio 1 and Radio City for over 20 years, and continues to host his late night talk show on Radio City Talk. The programme is also carried by sister station Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool. In April 2009, Price was made an 'Honorary Scouser' by the Lord Mayor of Liverpool. =Current shows= Price's recent shows were originally broadcast on Magic Radio, until it garnered mass attention following controversies with callers on air. The show was broadcast over Radio City 96.7 and City Talk 105.9 on Sun-Thurs nights. This was until July 2014 when City started to join up with the rest of the Bauer Media stations late night show with Kate Lawler. Price presented a live phone-in programme which was broadcast on Radio City Talk . Guests have included Dennis the Chemist, and Pheobe, an alleged psychic and Angel Card reader. The programme was one of the most popular night-time talk shows in the UK, with one show recently attracting 19,000 attempted calls. In May 2020, following the announcement of Radio City Talk's planned closure, it was also confirmed that Price would lose his weekly phone-in programme. Price reacted by saying he was \\"devastated\\" by the news.https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz- news/pete-price-devastated-radio-show-18217263 =Notable incidents= Pete was praised for abandoning his midweek show on one occasion in February 2004 to go to the aid of a 13-year-old caller who was threatening to kill himself. In January 2006, Pete's show on sister station Magic 1548 hit the headlines in Liverpool when a regular caller known as \\"Terry\\" stopped responding live on air during a debate. After Merseyside Police refused to check on the man's safety, Pete again abandoned the show (music was played after he left the St. John's Beacon studios) to travel to the man's home. Unfortunately, as he arrived, Pete saw an ambulance outside the house. Concerned listeners had already gained entry into the man's home and found that he had died from a suspected heart attack. Soon after this, the Monday-Thursday show left Magic 1548 and was moved to Radio City 96.7's late night phone-in. Also in September 2007, an extract from his autobiography was published in the Liverpool Echo, which revealed that Price had abused cocaine, although he \\"handed himself in\\" to the police shortly after through shame. In October 2007, it was reported by the Liverpool Echo that Price had received a \\"homophobic\\" death threat via text live on air. The sender was arrested shortly afterwards when police were contacted immediately after the receipt of the threatening text. They also reported that \\"on another occasion, a man tried to break into Radio City's headquarters, because he had become convinced Price had tried to kill John Lennon\\" In January 2008 Pete tried to find his natural father by using the networking skills of an imprisoned Sicilian Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano in the hope that \\"The Don\\" can help him trace his dad. His biological mother, upon restoring contact with him, gave him a photograph of his biological father: a Sicilian prisoner of war held near Warrington. Pete himself said that the Mafia \\"must have the best information network in the world\\". In December 2016 Pete and Radio City 2 were contacted by numerous scuba divers and environmentally savvy members of the public begging them to cancel a mass balloon release at midnight on 22 December. The balloon release went ahead. Two leading diving journalists contacted Radio City 2's owner - Bauer Media Group - appealing for this practice to be stopped. Bauer Media confirmed that no company within the Group would conduct a balloon release in the future. Writer In September 2007, Price released an autobiography (co-written by Adrian Butler), Pete Price: Namedropper topped Liverpool best seller charts within its first few days of sale, and was serialised in the Liverpool Echo. He often jokes about releasing a second autobiography entitled The Bitch is Back. This autobiography, to be published on the day of his death, he says, would contain a list of all the men he has slept with.

It is regarded to be the first comic strip magazine to feature a recurring character. Star Ally Sloper, a blustery, lazy schemer often found \\"sloping\\" through alleys to avoid his landlord and other creditors, had debuted in 1867 in the humour magazine Judy -- created by writer and fledgling artist Charles Henry Ross and inked and later fully illustrated by his French wife Emilie de Tessier under the pseudonym \\"Marie Duval\\" (or \\"Marie DuVal\\"; sources differ). The \\"half holiday\\" referred to in the title was the practice in Victorian Britain of allowing the workers home at lunchtime on a Saturday, a practice that also established the kick-off times of football matches. Publication history 19th-century issue of the British comic magazine Ally Sloper's Half Holiday The black-and-white weekly comic paper Ally Sloper's Half Holiday, typically of eight tabloid pages and priced one penny, was first published on 3 May 1884, a short time after Ross, had sold the rights to the character to Gilbert Dalziel, an engraver and the publisher of Judy. Initially launching the paper with proprietor W. J. Sinkins, Dalziel was soon in full control, publishing it from \\"The Sloperies\\", 99 Shoe Lane, EC. Alongside the strips featuring Sloper, the magazine also featured prose stories and cartoons and strips of other characters. Sales of the magazine have been estimated as being as high as 350,000, the magazine describing itself as \\"the largest selling paper in the world\\". The paper found a mixed audience: aimed at adults it captured both a loyal working class, male base, as well as attracting a cult following amongst the middle class of the time. Although the weekly initially ceased publication on 9 September 1916, after 1,679 issues, it was later revived between 5 November 1922 and 14 April 1923, again from 1948 to 1949, and finally from 1976 to 1977, each attempt failing to capture the imagination of the British public as the original once had. In 2001, a copy of the first issue fetched ¬£3,600 at an English auction house. Contributors William Giles Baxter took over art duties for the Sloper character with issue 13. William Fletcher Thomas became the artist on the Ally Sloper strips following Baxter's death in 1888. James Gibbins contributed his expertise in the field of handwriting, a skill he put forward to the police at the time of the Jack the Ripper murders, offering to analyse items thought to be authored by the Ripper. Thomas Burke contributed stories. Influence The weekly comic paper is widely cited as being the first comic book or magazine to feature a regular character, and is also often cited as the first comic as well. Half Holiday helped established the financial viability of the medium and codified the British form to an extent visible many years later in publications such as Viz. During 1908 C. H. Chapman illustrated the Ally Sloper character. Chapman was better known as the artist that drew Billy Bunter from 1911 until The Magnet folded in 1940. He continued to illustrate Billy Bunter in books through the 1950s.

Plot The film is set in feudal Japan during the 18th century, an era known as the Edo period. It depicts the struggles and schemes of Matajuro Unno, a r≈çnin, or masterless samurai, and his neighbor Shinza, a hairdresser. A scene from the film The story begins in a slum where poor families perform menial jobs. Shinza, though a hairdresser by trade, actually makes his living by running illicit gambling rooms and pawning his belongings. Unno, who lives with his wife next door, is the son of Matabei Unno, a great samurai. Since his father's death, Unno has struggled to find work and hopes that Mouri, his father's former master, will hire him after reading a letter from his father. Mouri avoids Unno and finds excuses not to read his father's letter. Nevertheless, Unno seeks out Mouri every day and follows him wherever he goes. Mouri tries to get rid of Unno by sending a gang of men to intimidate him and telling his gate guards to keep him out. Unno's wife waits for news that Mouri has hired Unno, but every day he tells her that \\"he'll meet Mr. Mouri tomorrow.\\" With her husband out of work, she supports him by making kamifusen (Japanese paper balloons). Unno avoids telling her that Mouri keeps rejecting him and starts drinking to forget his humiliation. Despite his worsening situation, however, he keeps his dignity by not accepting gifts, loans, or favors. Shinza's story runs in parallel with Unno's, albeit more dramatically. Shinza often gets beaten up by local pawn shop owner Shiroko Ya's gang for money he owes and for secretly organizing gambling games in their territory. Shinza fearlessly disregards their threats, angering the gang and their leader, Genshichi Yatagoro. Shinza loses all of his money when the gang chases him out of a secret gambling den, so he boldly goes to Shiroko's shop to pawn his hairdressing equipment. Upon reaching Shiroko's place unannounced, he finds Shiroko's daughter Okoma and his clerk Chushichi in the midst of a romantic moment. This discovery makes an impression, because Okoma's father and Mouri have already arranged for Okoma to marry the son of a rich old samurai against her will. Chushichi refuses to offer Shinza anything for his hairdressing tools, and Shinza makes up his mind up to avenge himself. While this is happening, Unno's wife decides to visit her sister's family. Before leaving, she reminds Unno not to drink too much sake, since he had only recently recovered from an illness. He promises her that he will not drink. When Okoma goes out with Chushichi to a festival, Shinza kidnaps her to punish Yatagoro. After learning that Okoma has not come home, Shiroko sends Yatagoro and his gang to pay Shinza quietly with a ransom to preserve the girl's reputation before the wedding. Shinza convinces his neighbor Unno to hide Okoma in his room when Yatagoro and his men search for her. When Yatagoro offers only a small ransom payment, Shinza refuses and tries to humiliate Yatagoro by telling him to shave his head and apologize for treating him so badly. Furious, Yatagoro leaves and sends one of his men to inform Shiroko that Shinza will not let Okoma go. Shinza's landlord, seeing an opportunity to make some money (because neither Shinza nor the other tenants pay the rent very often), goes to Shiroko and negotiates the release of the girl for ten times more money than Yatagoro had initially offered. Although Shinza insists that he does not really care about the ransom, the landlord forces him to accept his share of the money. When Okoma leaves her hiding place in Unno's room to board a palanquin sent by her father, everyone in the neighborhood feels disappointed to see that Unno had participated in a shameful scheme unworthy of a samurai. When Okoma comes home, Chushichi promises that they will run away together. Shinza celebrates his victory over Yatagoro and Shiroko by treating all the men from his neighborhood to sake at the local bar. He pressures the hesitant Unno into joining the party. Unno's wife comes back from her sister's just in time to see her husband breaking his promise and heading to the bar. Though unwilling to drink at first, Unno feels so elated after learning that Okoma's kidnapping damaged Mouri's reputation that he happily drinks with Shinza. As Unno's wife approaches her home, she overhears the neighborhood women criticizing Unno for getting involved in the kidnapping. She realizes that her husband has broken not only his promise to her, but also his samurai code of honor, and the neighbors have lost all respect for him. Yatagoro and his men arrive at the bar and summon Shinza to leave the party and walk over to a nearby bridge. Shinza knows that he is no match for Yatagoro in a fight, but accepts his fate calmly and bravely. Unno comes back home drunk. When confronted by his wife, he lies to her again, promising that he gave the letter to Mouri and that he must now wait for the turmoil of the kidnapping to subside. After he passes out on the floor, she finds his father's letter still in his pocket and finally knows for certain that Mouri has mistreated and insulted her husband all along. As a last resort to save their honor, she takes out a tant≈ç (short sword) and commits seppuku on her husband and herself. The neighbors find their bodies the next day, but suicides happen in the slum so often that they see no meaning in their demise. The film ends with a little boy running to tell the landlord about the deaths and dropping a kamifusen into a drainage gutter full of running water. Floating in the current, the paper balloon recedes into the distance.

Release Humanity and Paper Balloons was distributed in Japan by Toho Eiga on 25 August 1937. It was released as Humanity and Paper Ballooons with English subtitles in August 1982 in the United States. Reception Largely unknown outside Japan for years, the film has been hailed by critics such as Tadao Sato and Donald Richie, and Japanese filmmakers including Akira Kurosawa, as one of the most influential examples of jidaigeki, or Japanese period films. Jasper Sharp of Midnight Eye described the film as \\"a fascinating time capsule of a movie that not only reframes the feudal period in which it is set to present a harsh critique of the social and political conditions of the time it was made, but also demonstrates just how tight, coherent, and entertaining films from this period actually were.\\" In 2012, Spanish film programmer Fran Gayo listed the film as one of the greatest films of all time.

Exchanged cells can multiply and establish long-lasting cell lines that are immunologically active even decades after giving birth. Microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that originate from another individual and are therefore genetically distinct from the cells of the host individual. This phenomenon may be related to certain types of autoimmune diseases; however, the mechanisms responsible for this relationship are unclear. The term comes from the prefix \\"micro\\" + \\"chimerism\\" based on the Chimera of Greek mythology. Types =Human= In humans (and perhaps in all placentals), the most common form is fetomaternal microchimerism (also known as fetal cell microchimerism or fetal chimerism) whereby cells from a fetus pass through the placenta and establish cell lineages within the mother. Fetal cells have been documented to persist and multiply in the mother for several decades. The exact phenotype of these cells is unknown, although several different cell types have been identified, such as various immune lineages, mesenchymal stem cells, and placental-derived cells. A 2012 study at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, has detected cells with the Y chromosome in multiple areas of the brains of deceased women. Fetomaternal microchimerism occurs during pregnancy and shortly after giving birth for most women. However, not all women who have had children contain fetal cells. Studies suggest that fetomaternal microchimerism could be influenced by killer-cell immunoglobin-like (KIR) ligands. Lymphocytes also influence the development of persisting fetomaternal microchimerism since natural killer cells compose about 70% of lymphocytes in the first trimester of pregnancy. KIR patterns on maternal natural killer cells of the mother and KIR ligands on the fetal cells could have an effect on fetomaternal microchimerism. In one study, mothers with KIR2DS1 exhibited higher levels of fetomaternal microchimerism compared to mothers who were negative for this activating KIR. The potential health consequences of these cells are unknown. One hypothesis is that these fetal cells might trigger a graft-versus-host reaction leading to autoimmune disease. This offers a potential explanation for why many autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in middle-aged women. Another hypothesis is that fetal cells home to injured or diseased maternal tissue where they act as stem cells and participate in repair. It is also possible that the fetal cells are merely innocent bystanders and have no effect on maternal health. After giving birth, about 50‚Äì75% of women carry fetal immune cell lines. Maternal immune cells are also found in the offspring yielding in maternal‚Üífetal microchimerism, though this phenomenon is about half as frequent as the former. Microchimerism had also been shown to exist after blood transfusions to a severely immunocompromised population of patients who suffered trauma. Other possible sources of microchimerism include gestation, an individual's older sibling, twin sibling, or vanished twin, with the cells being received in utero. Fetal-maternal microchimerism is especially prevalent after abortion or miscarriage. =Animal= Microchimerism occurs in most pairs of twins in cattle. In cattle (and other bovines), the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse and the twins share blood circulation, resulting in exchange of cell lines. If the twins are a male‚Äìfemale pair, then XX/XY microchimerism results, and male hormones partially masculinize the heifer (female), creating a martin heifer or freemartin. Freemartins appear female, but are infertile and so cannot be used for breeding or dairy production. Microchimerism provides a method of diagnosing the condition, because male genetic material can be detected in a blood sample. Fetomaternal microchimerism in the brain Several studies have identified male DNA in both the human and mouse brains of mothers following pregnancy of a male fetus. It has been suggested that the fetal-derived cells can differentiate into those capable of presenting neurotypical immunomarkers on their surface. There has been no strong evidence to say microchimerism of the maternal brain leads to disease, however, Parkinson‚Äôs disease correlates with a higher incidence of brain microchimeras. Alzheimer‚Äôs disease studies support nearly the opposite correlation, the more fetal-derived cells present, the lower the chance of the patient having had Alzheimer‚Äôs. Maternal tolerance to paternal-fetal antigens There are many mechanisms at the maternal-fetal interface to prevent immune rejection of fetal cells. Nevertheless, systemic immunological changes occur in pregnant women. For example, condition of women suffering from autoimmune disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis) improves during pregnancy. These changes in immune responses during pregnancy extend to maternal components specific to fetal antigens, because of feto- maternal cell transfer and their retention in mother tissues. During pregnancy, numbers of fetal cells in maternal tissues increase and correlate with expansion of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Decreased expansion and decidual accumulation of Treg cause pregnancy complications (preeclampsia, abortions). In mice models, most mother‚Äôs fetal-specific CD8+ T cells undergo clonal deletion and express low levels of chemokine receptors and ligands ‚Äì this prevents remaining fetal-specific CD8+ T cells from entering the maternal-fetal interface. Mother‚Äôs fetal-specific CD4+ T cells proliferate, and due to FOXP3 expression, differentiate into Treg cells. Mice models show that fetal-specific Treg cells are necessary for successful pregnancy. Fetal tolerance to noninherited maternal antigens Fetal T cells accumulate during in utero development. Even though the fetus is exposed to noninherited maternal antigens (NIMAs), fetal CD4 T cells are capable of alloantigen- induced proliferation, preferentially differentiating to Treg cells and preventing a fetal immune response to maternal antigens. This expanded immune tolerance persists in both mother and offspring after birth and allows microchimeric cells to be retained in tissues. Postnatal tolerance to NIMAs NIMA-specific tolerance causes some interesting immunological phenotypes: sensitization to erythrocyte Rhesus factor (Rh) antigens is reduced among Rh- women born to Rh+ women, long-term kidney allograft survival is improved in NIMA-matched donor-recipient sibling pairs, or acuteness of bone marrow transplantation graft-versus-host disease is reduced, when recipients of donor stem cells are NIMA-matched. Cross-fostering animal studies show that when postnatal NIMA exposure though breastfeeding is eliminated, survival of NIMA-matched allografts is reduced. This suggests that to maintain NIMA-specific tolerance in offspring, breastfeeding is essential, but ingestion of mother‚Äôs cells alone does not prime NIMA-specific tolerance. Both prenatal and postnatal exposure to mother‚Äôs cells is required to maintain NIMA-specific tolerance. Benefits of microchimeric cells The severity of preexisting autoimmune disorders is reduced during pregnancy and it is most apparent when fetal microchimeric cells levels are highest - during the last trimester. These cells can also replace injured maternal cells and recover tissue function (type I diabetes mouse model showed replacement of defective maternal islet cells by fetal-derived pancreatic cells). Fetal microchimeric cells can differentiate into cell types that infiltrate and replace injured cells in models of Parkinson‚Äôs disease or myocardial infarction. They also help in wound healing by neoangiogenesis. Seeding of fetal microchimeric cells into maternal tissues has been proposed to promote care of offspring after birth (seeding of maternal breast tissue may promote lactation, and seeding of brain may enhance maternal attention). Relationship with autoimmune diseases and breast cancer Microchimerism has been implicated in autoimmune diseases. Independent studies repeatedly suggested that microchimeric cells of fetal origin may be involved in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis. Moreover, microchimeric cells of maternal origin may be involved in the pathogenesis of a group of autoimmune diseases found in children, i.e. juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (one example would be juvenile dermatomyositis). Microchimerism has now been further implicated in other autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus. Contrarily, an alternative hypothesis on the role of microchimeric cells in lesions is that they may be facilitating tissue repair of the damaged organ. Moreover, fetal immune cells have also been frequently found in breast cancer stroma as compared to samples taken from healthy women. It is not clear, however, whether fetal cell lines promote the development of tumors or, contrarily, protect women from developing breast carcinoma. =Systemic lupus erythematosus= The presence of fetal cells in mothers can be associated with benefits when it comes to certain autoimmune diseases. In particular, male fetal cells are related to helping mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus. When kidney biopsies were taken from patients with lupus nephritis, DNA was extracted and run with PCR. The male fetal DNA was quantified and the presence of specific Y chromosome sequences were found. Women with lupus nephritis containing male fetal cells in their kidney biopsies exhibited better renal system functioning. Levels of serum creatinine, which is related to kidney failure, were low in mothers with high levels of male fetal cells. In contrast, women without male fetal cells who had lupus nephritis showed a more serious form of glomerulonephritis and higher levels of serum creatinine. The specific role that fetal cells play in microchimerism related to certain autoimmune diseases is not fully understood. However, one hypothesis states that these cells supply antigens, causing inflammation and triggering the release of different foreign antigens. This would trigger autoimmune disease instead of serving as a therapeutic. A different hypothesis states that fetal microchimeric cells are involved in repairing tissues. When tissues get inflamed, fetal microchimeric cells go to the damaged site and aid in repair and regeneration of the tissue. =Thyroid disease= Fetal maternal microchimerism may be related to autoimmune thyroid diseases. There have been reports of fetal cells in the lining of the blood and thyroid glands of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. These cells could become activated after delivery of the baby after immune suppression in the mother is lost, suggesting a role of fetal cells in the pathogenesis of such diseases. Two types of thyroid disease, Hashimoto‚Äôs Thyroiditis (HT) and Graves‚Äô Disease (GD) show similarities to graft vs host disease which occurs after hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Fetal cells colonize maternal tissues like the thyroid gland and are able to survive many years postpartum. These fetal microchimeric cells in the thyroid show up in the blood of women affected by thyroid diseases. =Sj√∂gren's syndrome= Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SS) is autoimmune rheumatic disease of the exocrine glands. Increased incidence of SS after childbirth suggests a relationship between SS and pregnancy, and this led to hypothesis that fetal microchimerism may be involved in SS pathogenesis. Studies showed presence of the Y-chromosome-positive fetal cells in minor salivary glands in 11 of 20 women with SS but in only one of eight normal controls. Fetal cells in salivary glands suggest that they may be involved in the development of SS. =Oral lichen planus= Lichen planus (LP) is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune chronic disease of unknown etiology. Females have a three times higher prevalence than men. LP is characterized by T lymphocytes infiltration of the lower levels of epithelium, where they damage basal cells and cause apoptosis. The fetal microchimerism may trigger a fetus versus host reaction and therefore may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including LP. = Breast cancer = Pregnancy has a positive effect on the prognosis of breast cancer according to several studies also it apparently increases the chance of survival after diagnosis of this tumor disease. Possible positive effects of pregnancy could be explained by the persistence of fetal cells in the blood and maternal tissues. Fetal cells are probably actively migrating from peripheral blood into the tumor tissue where they are preferentially settled in the tumor stroma and their concentration decreases as they get closer to the healthy breast tissue. There are two suggested mechanisms by which the fetal cells could have the positive effect on the breast cancer prognosis. First mechanism suggests that fetal cells only oversee cancer cells and they attract components of the immune system if needed. The second option is that the down-regulation of the immune system induced by the presence of fetal cells could ultimately lead to cancer prevention, because women in whom FMC is present produce lower concentrations of inflammatory mediators, which may lead to the development of neoplastic tissue. The effect also depends on the level of microchimerism: Hyperchimerism (too high a degree of microchimerism) can, as well as hypochimerism (low rate of microchimerism), be related to the negative effect of FMC and thus can promote worse prognosis of breast cancer. Apparently, women with breast cancer may fail in the process of obtaining and maintaining allogeneic fetal cells. Low concentration and / or complete absence of fetal cells could indicate a predisposition to development of the malignant process. =Other cancers= Study of S. Hallum shows association between male origin fetal cells and ovarian cancer risk. Presence of Y chromosome was used to detect foreign cells in women‚Äôs blood. Microchimerism is a result of pregnancy, possibility that foreign cells were of transfusion or transplantation origin was rejected due to women‚Äôs health. Women testing positive for male origin microchimerism cells had reduced hazard rates of ovarian cancer than women testing negative. Pregnancy at older ages can reduce risk of ovarian cancer. Numbers of microchimeric cells declines after pregnancy, and ovarian cancer is most frequent in postmenopausal women. This suggests that fetal microchimerism may play a protective role in ovarian cancer as well. Microchimeric cells also cluster several times more in lung tumors than in surrounding healthy lung tissue. Fetal cells from the bone marrow go to the tumor sites where they may have tissue repair functions. Microchimerism of fetomaternal cell trafficking origin might be associated with the pathogenesis or progression of cervical cancer. Male cells were observed in patients with cervical cancer but not in positive controls. Microchimeric cells might induce the alteration of the woman's immune system and make the cervical tissue more susceptible to HPV infection or provide a suitable environment for tumor growth. Role of microchimerism in the wound healing Microchimeric fetal cells expressed collagen I, III and TGF-Œ≤3, and they were identified in healed maternal cesarean section scars. This suggests that these cells migrate to the site of damage due to maternal skin injury signals, and help repair tissue. Stem cells =Animal models= Fetomaternal microchimerism has been shown in experimental investigations of whether fetal cells can cross the blood brain barrier in mice. The properties of these cells allow them to cross the blood brain barrier and target injured brain tissue. This mechanism is possible because umbilical cord blood cells express some proteins similar to neurons. When these umbilical cord blood cells are injected in rats with brain injury or stroke, they enter the brain and express certain nerve cell markers. Due to this process, fetal cells could enter the brain during pregnancy and become differentiated into neural cells. Fetal microchimerism can occur in the maternal mouse brain, responding to certain cues in the maternal body. Health implications Fetal microchimerism could have an implication on maternal health. Isolating cells in cultures can alter the properties of the stem cells, but in pregnancy the effects of fetal stem cells can be investigated without in vitro cultures. Once characterized and isolated, fetal cells that are able to cross the blood brain barrier could impact certain procedures. For example, isolating stem cells can be accomplished through taking them from sources like the umbilical cord. These fetal stem cells can be used in intravenous infusion to repair the brain tissue. Hormonal changes in pregnancy alter neurogenesis, which could create favorable environments for fetal cells to respond to injury. The true function on fetal cells in mothers is not fully known, however, there have been reports of positive and negative health effects. The sharing of genes between the fetus and mother may lead to benefits. Due to not all genes being shared, health complications may arise as a result of resource allocation. During pregnancy, fetal cells are able to manipulate the maternal system to draw resources from the placenta, while the maternal system tries to limit it.

He was created by Gary Gygax as a player character, only months after the start of Gygax's Greyhawk campaign, and is therefore one of the oldest characters continuously associated with D&D.; Once Gygax was forced out of TSR, Inc., he lost creative control of Mordenkainen. TSR then made Mordenkainen a powerful wizard with strong convictions against moral absolutes, and the leader of the Circle of Eight, a cabal of eight powerful wizards. In fiction associated with the World of Greyhawk, he has played diverse roles as both protagonist and antagonist. Official publications for the World of Greyhawk sometimes contradict each other regarding Mordenkainen. It is clear, however, that he is an important figure in the fictional history of the Flanaess. Creative origins In late 1972, Gary Gygax created Castle Greyhawk and the dungeons beneath it. After a few months of almost non-stop play as the Dungeon Master,Gygax: \\"An average of seven gaming sessions a week was typical even when I was busy working. Often I played more than that. \\" Gygax asked one of the players, Rob Kuntz, to become co-Dungeon Master, which would allow Gygax an opportunity to experience the game as a player. Gygax subsequently created several characters, including a 1st-level wizard in early 1973.Gygax: \\"Mordenkainen came into being about the first month of 1973.\\" Gygax was interested in Finnish mythology, and named the wizard Mordenkainen, a portmanteau of the mythical heroes Mordecai and Lemmink√§inen.Gygax: \\"The background I created for Mordenkainen was Finnish- like in nature, and his master was a chap called 'Old Waino'... [‚Ä¶] I picked the name because one Vainomoinen was sometimes referred to as \\"Old Waino.\\" I really was captivated with Finnish myth after seeing a B&W; movie done by the Russians, I think, about him, Leminkainen, and Ilmarinen adventuring to Pojola and entering Louhi's fortress, then reading The Green Magician by de Camp and Pratt as well as the Kalevala.\\" Robert J. Kuntz started running a role- playing campaign set in his world of Kalibruhn in 1973, in which Gary Gygax was the main player and his famous characters Mordenkainen and Yrag originated upon that world. He was to become Gygax's most famous character, and also his favorite to play.Q: \\"Of the characters you have played, which is your favorite?\\" Gygax: \\"I really must admit Mordenkainen is my favorite. I enjoy playing fighters, rangers, thieves, clerics, and multi-classed sorts in OAD&D;, but the magic-user is usually most fun for me.\\" Over several years of gameplay, mainly from 1973 to 1985, Gygax developed the character traits and adventures with which Mordenkainen would become associated, as well as raising the wizard to \\"twenty-something levels\\".Gygax: \\"I do believe that Mordenkainen earned his twenty-something levels through cleverness, daring, a bit of luck, and dint of trying...\\" During this period, Gygax united Mordenkainen with seven of his other characters to form the Circle of Eight.Gygax: \\"The original [Circle of Eight] was composed of my PCs ‚Äì Mordenkainen, Bigby, Yrag, Rigby, Felnorith, Zigby, Vram & Vin. In the novel version the Circle was expanded to encompass other PCs in my campaign such as Tenser. It came into being because Mordenkainen and Associates had a lot of wealth stored up from successful adventuring, located a place for a stronghold deep in enemy territory to assure plenty of action, and then went to work building the citadel. As there was a small army of dwarves associated with the larger, mounted field army, the building project went relatively quickly, about three game years to complete. While it was in progress, the 'boys' were active in raiding the lands around to keep the enemy forces back on their heels.\\" Gygax: \\"The Obsidian Citadel was indeed my personal creation as a player.... It was an octagonal castle with eight wall towers and a central keep with much space between the outer wall and the inner works because of the number of troops housed in this fortress.Gygax: \\"The Obsidian Citadel and its Circle of Eight was original to my own campaign. When Mordenkainen was at a level I considered too high for normal adventuring, I used the money he and his associates had amassed to construct the said fortress. The members of the 'Circle were Mordenkainen and...others of my PCs: Bigby, Yrag the fighter, Rigby the cleric, Zigby the Dwarf, the Elves Vram and Vin, and Felnorith as principles. A number of lesser PCs were [also] associated.\\" During his lifetime, Gygax never disclosed any of Mordenkainen's original game statistics.Q: \\"May we see [Mordenkainen's] stats?\\" Gygax: \\"Can you see Mordie's stats? No! I won't even show you those for my most recent PC, Louhi Sharpnose, a gnome illusionist and treasure finder who I created only about four years back.\\" When Gygax was forced out of TSR in 1985, he lost the rights to most of the characters he had mentioned in TSR publications, including Mordenkainen.Gygax: \\"Anagrams of my name are exclusively my property according to my settlement agreement with TSR, so that is how I can use Zagyg, or Zagig, as well as Yrag.\\" TSR subsequently changed Mordenkainen in ways unforeseen by his creator. When the Greyhawk campaign world was reset in 1991's From the Ashes, Mordenkainen was refashioned as the world's most powerful wizard. The Circle of Eight was now described as a cabal of eight wizards supervised by Mordenkainen, who together sought to balance the forces of good and evil. Mordenkainen is one of the famous mages whose spells were included in the 1988 Greyhawk Adventures hardbound. His name has been associated with various spells published in the Dungeons & Dragons system of magic. Publishing history Mordenkainen's AD&D; statistics were first published in The Rogues Gallery (1980), although Gary Gygax was later emphatic that he never gave author Brian Blume any information about the wizard, and insisted that Blume had been forced to make up the published statistics.\\"The information in the Rogue's Gallery was quite fallacious, made up in many cases when we refused to give Brian (Blume) our PCs' stats. Rob respected my wishes and didn't use Mordie's actual stats and information [in Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure], and whatever was written thereafter based on those works continues the error. Brian Blume compiled Rogues Gallery, and when persons would not give him information regarding their PCs, as Rob and I did, he simply made up whatever suited him.\\" Variations on Mordenkainen's AD&D; statistics were also published in Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure (1984), The City of Greyhawk (1989) and Epic Level Handbook (2002). He was also mentioned in the following publications: *Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk (2007) *\\"The Wizards Three\\" series of articles from Dragon Magazine *Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium (2011) *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes (2018) Mordenkainen also figured prominently in the parody adventure Castle Greyhawk (1988), in which he runs a film studio, possibly a reference to Gary Gygax's work at the time as TSR's liaison to Hollywood while he was developing the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon and other projects. Mordenkainen appears in material for the fifth edition of D&D;, including Curse of Strahd (2016), and Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus (2019). Mordenkainen's name appeared in certain spells core rulebooks of the game's 3rd edition's as one of the few elements from Greyhawk, even though that was designated as the core setting. Spells named after Mordenkainen also appear in D&D-based; computer games like Neverwinter Nights. Description Mordenkainen is described as tall, with a greyly streaked Van Dyke beard, wearing long boots and carrying a staff. He keeps his own council and does not tolerate fools. He operates according to a theory based on power balance and Neutrality, trying to keep neither Good nor Evil from getting the upper hand; he operates very much from the shadows. Reception Mordenkainen was #9 on Game Rant's 2020 \\"10 Must-Have NPCs In Dungeons & Dragons Lore To Make Your Campaigns Awesome\\" list ‚Äî the article states that \\"As an NPC, players might search for Mordenkainen for his expertise in the magical arts. After all, Mordenkainen heads the Circle of Eight, a group of Wizards and prolific spell inventors. Campaigns planning on adapting Curse of Strahd may also include Mordenkainen as an NPC they need to save‚Äì or face, depending on the circumstances.\\" Writer Aubrey Sherman called Mordenkainen one \\"of Dungeons & Dragons's most famous wizards\\" and found similarities with both Elminster and Gandalf with respect to appearance, demeanor, outlook and importance in their respective worlds.

It is the vehicular gateway to Fraser Island, a popular recreational area. It lies between Tin Can Bay to the South West and Great Sandy Strait to the North and curves back towards Rainbow Beach and the Coral Sea to the East. The southern tip of Fraser Island, Hook Point lies some 1,200 metres north of Inskip Point, the northern tip of the peninsula.

It opens directly onto the Atlantic Ocean. The bay is demarcated by Cape Freels to the north and Cape Bonavista to the south. Cape Bonavista is also the eastern limit of the Bonavista Peninsula, which forms the bay's southern shore. The topography of the central western shore of the bay is composed of numerous channels and islands. This area also hosts Terra Nova National Park. Containing many densely forested islands, Bonavista Bay is virtually landlocked. With temperatures sometimes reaching -1 ¬∞C, it attracts the occasional iceberg. However, due to the dense forestry, the region inside the bay can sometimes be warm enough for lobster cultivation.

He wrote A Stranger in The Earth and The Confessions of Mycroft Holmes: A Paper Chase, for which he won the Somerset Maugham Award in 2002. His third novel, A Blow to the Heart, was published by Faber in 2006. His fourth, Far North, was published in June 2009. His fifth, Strange Bodies, was published in May 2013. He has also worked in television news in New York City and in Boston. He is the elder son of the American travel writer and novelist Paul Theroux and his then-wife Anne Castle. His younger brother, Louis Theroux, is a journalist, documentarian, and television presenter. Early life Marcel Theroux was born in 1968 in Kampala, Uganda, where his American father, Paul Theroux, was teaching at Makerere University. His mother is Anne Castle, an Englishwoman. The family spent the next two years in Singapore, where his father taught at the National University of Singapore. After their move to England, Theroux was brought up in Wandsworth, London. After attending a state primary school, he boarded at Westminster School where his best friend was Nick Clegg. He went on to study English literature at Clare College, Cambridge. He won a fellowship to study International Relations with a specialisation in Soviet and East European Studies at Yale University. He lives in Tooting, London and is married. His paternal French surname originates from the region around Sarthe and Yonne in France. It is quite common in francophone countries and is originally spelled Th√©roux. His father, born and raised in the United States, is of half French Canadian and half Italian descent. Career From 2000 to 2002, Theroux presented a series of documentaries for Unreported World. In 2004 he presented The End of the World as We Know It, part of the War on Terra television series about climate change on Channel 4. He was chosen as presenter because he originally knew nothing about the subject. He initially believed that all environmentalists were opposed to technological progress. But during his research, he became convinced that the world faced a global problem on a scale so serious that an expansion of nuclear energy is probably the best solution (choosing the lesser evil). He reached this conclusion partly in response to his interviews with several experts, such as Gerhard Bertz of the insurance agency Munich Re, who said that during the past 20 years, payments for natural disasters have increased by 500 percent. He also interviewed Royal Dutch Shell chairman Lord Ron Oxburgh. A PR assistant interrupted them. Oxburgh's negative views on the consequences of current oil consumption were likely considered detrimental to the corporation's image. In March 2006 Theroux presented Death of a Nation on More4, as part of The State of Russia series. In the programme he explored the country's post-Soviet problems, including population decline, the growing AIDS epidemic, and the persecution of the Meskhetian Turks. During interviews in the programme, he spoke simple Russian. Sewell-Hohler Syndicate at 1 Whitehall Place On 28 September 2008 he presented Oligart: The Great Russian Art Boom on Channel 4, exploring the role of Russia's rich in keeping Russia's art history alive by buying and exhibiting domestic art. In March 2009, Faber and Faber published Theroux's Far North, a future epic set in the Siberian taiga. On 16 March 2009, Theroux presented In Search of Wabi-sabi on BBC Four, as part of the channel's 'Hidden Japan' season of programming. Theroux travelled and reported from Japan to explore the aesthetic tastes of Japan and its people. In 2012, Theroux presented a documentary for Unreported World Series 23, on the subject of street children in Ukraine. His novel Strange Bodies won the 2014 John W. Campbell Memorial Award. In 2017, Theroux presented a documentary for Unreported World which explored the social and economic consequences of the recent rise in Orthodoxy and Russian nationalism under Vladimir Putin. In 2020, Theroux presented a documentary for Unreported World which explored middle-aged, single Japanese men's obsession with 'Junior Idols' and whether it was a quirk in Japanese culture or something more sinister.

The game was later released on several other consoles such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and an upgraded version was made for DOS computers. The Amiga conversion was the responsibility of Ocean Software while the SNES and PC DOS versions were that of Gremlin Interactive, and the portable console versions were of Black Pearl Software. It is the direct sequel to Desert Strike (a best-seller released the previous year) and is the second installment in the Strike series. The game is a helicopter-based shoot 'em up, mixing action and strategy. The plot concerns two villains intent on destroying Washington, D.C.. The player must use the helicopter and occasionally other vehicles to thwart their plans. Its game engine was carried over from a failed attempt at a flight simulator and was inspired by Matchbox toys and Choplifter. Jungle Strike retained its predecessor's core mechanics and expanded on the model with additional vehicles and settings. The game was well received by most critics upon release. Publications praised its gameplay, strategy, design, controls and graphics. Plot Jungle Strike features two antagonists: Ibn Kilbaba, the son of Desert Strike's antagonist, and Carlos Ortega, a notorious South American drug lord. The opening sequence depicts the two men observing a nuclear explosion on a deserted island, while discussing the delivery of \\"nuclear resources\\" and an attack on Washington D.C.; Kilbaba seeks revenge for his father's death at the hands of the US, while Ortega wishes to \\"teach the Yankees to stay out of my drug trade\\". The player takes control of a \\"lone special forces\\" pilot. The game's first level depicts the protagonist repelling terrorist attacks on Washington, D.C., including the President's limousine. Subsequent levels depict counter-attacks on the drug lord's forces, progressing towards his \\"jungle fortress\\". In the game's penultimate level, the player pursues Kilbaba and Ortega to their respective hideouts before capturing them. The final level takes place in Washington, D.C. again, where the two antagonists attempt to flee after escaping from prison. The player must destroy both Kilbaba and Ortega and stop four trucks carrying nuclear bombs from blowing up the White House. The PC version also extends the storyline with an extra level set in Alaska, in which the player must wipe out the remainder of Ortega's forces under the command of a Russian defector named Ptofski, who has taken control of oil tankers and is threatening to destroy the ecosystem with crude oil if his demands are not met. Once all levels are complete, the ending sequence begins and depicts the protagonist and his co- pilot in an open-topped car in front of cheering crowds. Gameplay The player's helicopter engages enemy soldiers and enemy anti-aircraft guns to recapture the stealth jet Jungle Strike is a helicopter-based shoot 'em up,Steve Bradley, \\"Jungle Strike CD32\\", Amiga Format, Aug 1995 (issue 74), p. 66 mixing action and strategy. The player's main weapon is a fictionalised Comanche attack helicopter. Additional vehicles can be commandeered: a motorbike, hovercraft and F-117. The latter in particular features variable height and unlimited ammunition, but is more vulnerable to crashes. The game features an \\"overhead\\" perspective \\"with a slight 3D twist\\".Paul Mellerick, \\"Let's Get Ready To Rumble (... In the Jungle)\\", Amiga Power, Oct 1994 (issue 42), p. 12 The graphics uses a 2.5D perspective which simulates the appearance of being 3D. Levels consist of several missions, which are based around the destruction of enemy weapons and installations, as well as rescuing hostages or prisoners of war, or capturing enemy personnel. The helicopter is armed with machine guns, more powerful Hydra rockets and yet more deadly Hellfire missiles. The more powerful the weapon, the fewer can be carried: the player must choose an appropriate weapon for each situation. Enemy weapons range from armoured cars to artillery and tanks. The player's craft has a limited amount of armour, which is depleted as the helicopter is hit by enemy fire. Should armour reach zero, the craft will be destroyed, costing the player a life. The player must outmanoeuvre enemies to avoid damage, but can replenish armour by means of power-ups or by airlifting rescued friendlies or captives to a landing zone. Vehicles have a finite amount of fuel which is steadily depleted as the level progresses. Should the fuel run out, the vehicle will crash, again costing the player a life. The craft can refuel by collecting fuel barrels. Vehicles also carry limited ammunition, which must be replenished by means of ammo crates. Development and release Jungle Strike is the sequel to Desert Strike, a similar game which parodied the Gulf War and which was released in 1992. Desert Strike arose from a failed attempt at a flight simulator and was inspired by Matchbox toys and Choplifter. Central to the game's concept were nonlinear gameplay and the eschewing of power-ups and bosses. With the success of the original title, producer Scott Berfield, game director John Manley and associate producer Tony Barnes were tasked with creating the sequel. Jungle Strike retained the core mechanics of its predecessor,Matthew Cockburn, \\"The Making of The Strike Series\\", Retro Gamer, Jan 2008 (issue 45), pp. 80‚Äì84 with the addition of various vehicles and settings. Desert Strike was at the time Electronic Arts' highest selling video game\\"The Ultimate Autumn Preview\\", Amiga Power, Oct 1992 (issue 18), p. 48 and maintained a high sales chart position as Jungle Strike was released in 1993.\\"Preview: Jungle Strike\\", Mega, May 1993 (issue 8), p. 28 The Amiga conversion of Desert Strike featured upgraded graphics and sound over the Mega Drive original.Mark Winstanley, \\"Things To Come: Desert Strike\\", Amiga Power, March 1993 (issue 23), pp. 18-19 With regards to the Jungle Strike Amiga conversion, senior programmer Stuart Johnson stated he \\"tried to keep this conversion a lot more faithful to the Mega Drive version than Desert Strike was\\". He attempted to make the Amiga conversion run more smoothly than the Mega Drive original. Graphical improvements were attempted: these were less successful on the A500 than the A1200 because of technical restrictions. The developers also struggled with technical challenges because of differences in hardware between the Mega Drive and Amiga. Amendments were also made to the workings of in-mission plot screens.Matt Broughton, \\"Choppers in the Mist\\", The One Amiga, Oct 1994, pp. 26-28 The Amiga conversion was released as sequel Urban Strike was published for the Mega Drive in 1994. DOS CD-ROM version includes full motion video cut scenes at introduction, between stages, and ending. Jungle Strike was followed by three further sequels: Urban Strike, Soviet Strike, and Nuclear Strike. As the series moved to more advanced consoles, series creator Mike Posehn became less involved in the programming side of development. Urban Strike, released for the Mega Drive, featured new vehicles and locations,Peter Parrish, Three Strikes And You're Out, Eurogamer, 13 February 2008, Accessed 14 June 2009 as well as on-foot sections. Soviet Strike, released for Sony's PlayStation and the Sega Saturn in 1996,Jeff Gerstmann, Soviet Strike Review, GameSpot, 1 December 1996, Accessed 16 July 2009 featured 3D graphics, as did Nuclear Strike, released on PC and PlayStation in 1997 and the Nintendo 64 in 1999. Another sequel provisionally titled Future Strike was planned, but the game was eventually released as Future Cop: LAPD, a mech-based shooter game. Reception The game was well received by critics upon release. Adrian Pitt and Mat Yeo of Sega Force both reviewed the game. Adrian Pitt called the title a \\"strategy game\\" and commented it as the \\"greatest game in the genre\\". Pritt said the controls were \\"without fault\\" and the graphics \\"superb\\". Mat Yeo praised the \\"amazing playability and 'lastability'\\" and said the game was \\"twice as good\\" as Desert Strike. Yeo called the graphics \\"brilliant\\" and said the game was \\"the best shoot 'em up I've seen in a long time\\".Adrian Pitt & Mat Yeo, \\"Reviewed!

Choon Klet pointed to a high initial difficulty but said: \\"Once the skills are acquired, be ready for many hours of enjoyment and sleepless nights.\\"Lim Choon Kiat, \\"Search and Destroy in Jungle Warfare\\", New Straits Times, 14 October 1993, p. 44 Chip and Jonathan Carter of St. Petersburg Times deemed the game one of the best of the year and felt the SNES version \\"loses nothing in the translation\\". The duo said the Game Boy and Game Gear versions were \\"less impressive\\" due to their technical restrictions but \\"about as good as you can get on the small screen\\". \\"Sir Garnabus\\" of GamePro was impressed with the Game Boy version's clear and detailed graphics, lack of slowdown, good controls, and faithfulness to the original version, but judged the Game Gear version to be \\"merely average\\", saying issues such as poor collision detection hamper the game despite its outstanding graphics. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the Game Boy version has good control, but the small graphics make it a struggle to play. They said the playability is dramatically better with the Super Game Boy, but that it would make no sense to buy the Game Boy version intending to play it that way, since Jungle Strike had already been released for the SNES. Amiga CD32 Gamer called Jungle Strike \\"a 500lb gorilla among games\\" and praised its ease of control and \\"masses of gameplay and realistic detail\\".\\"Oceanic Power\\", Amiga CD32 Gamer, Sept 1994 (issue 4) p. 14 Amiga Computing said: \\"With its impressive graphics and superbly designed game system, it could well be the best chopper title yet\\" although the reviewer felt the difficulty curve was too steep.Gareth Lofthouse, \\"Jungle Strike\\", Amiga Computing Feb 1995 (issue 83), pp. 112-113 Amiga Format said of the game: \\"with a little more foresight and planning, it could have been a lot more fun\\", as the reviewer was irritated by the fact that fuel, armour and ammunition levels were displayed on map screen. However the magazine also wrote: \\"The bottom line though, is that Jungle Strike is an incredibly good game\\".Steve McGill, \\"Game Review: Jungle Strike\\", Amiga Format, Jan 1995 (issue 67), pp. 52-53 Amiga Power called the game \\"an appreciable shoot 'em up\\" but said it was \\"clearly tailored for the shorter attention span\\" of a console gamer.Jonathan Nash, \\"Game Reviews: Jungle Strike\\", Amiga Power Jan 1995 (issue 45), pp. 44-46 CU Amiga Magazine wrote: \\"This blend of shooting and thinking action blends together seamlessly and in the process creates a classic blaster well worth a ride\\".Rik Skews, \\"Game Review: Jungle Strike\\", CU Amiga Magazine, Jan 1995, pp. 42-43 The One Amiga magazine wrote: \\"Jungle Strike's a fine game, which will prove both a challenge for Desert Strike-ophiles, and a good solid blast for first bloods\\".Andy Nuttal, \\"Jungle Strike\\", The One Amiga, Dec 1994 (issue 75), pp. 44-45 ACAR observed the game's \\"Good graphics, okay sound, smooth animation and tough game play.\\"\\"Amiga Review: CD32 Jungle Strike\\", ACAR, May 1995 (Vol 12 No 5) p. 68 Amiga Power complained that \\"Throughout the game you're battered with uneasily right-wing US politics\\", while Amiga Format said \\"jingoism\\" was \\"rife\\" throughout the game. Amiga CD32 Gamer called the plot \\"typically 'ugly American' idiocy\\". GamePro commented on the game's skillful challenge and variety of locales, and particularly praised the Super NES version for retaining the same gameplay of the Genesis version while improving on the graphics and sound. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"it's just what the doctor ordered for PC owners who feel nostalgic for their old Segas and Super Nintendos.\\" Notes References External links *Gremlin Interactive page *T¬∑HQ, Inc. page Category:1993 video games Category:Amiga 1200 games Category:Amiga games Category:CD32 games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Gremlin Interactive games Category:Malibu Interactive games Category:Ocean Software games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games scored by Brian L.

He served as an Extraordinary Lord of Session and Keeper of the Privy Seal. Life The 2nd Lord Ruthven was the son of William, Master of Ruthven (who was known as Lindsay for his mother, Isabel Livingstone Lindsay, until his legitimation on 2 July 1480), and Jean Hepburne. He succeeded his paternal grandfather, William Ruthven, 1st Lord Ruthven, sometime before 10 September 1528, when the king bestowed on him the office of custodian and constable of the king's hospital, near the Speygate, Perth. In February 1532 Ruthven, Lord Oliphant, and other barons in that district of Scotland were fined for not appearing to sit as jurymen at the trial of Lady Glamis at Forfar for poisoning her husband. He was admitted an extraordinary lord of session on 27 November 1533; and on 8 August 1542 he was named a member of the privy council. On 28 August 1536 the king confirmed to him and his heirs the lands of Glenshie in Strathearn, erected into a free forest. At the parliament held at Edinburgh in March 1543, after the death of King James V, Ruthven spoke on behalf of the laity being granted liberty to read the Scriptures in the English tongue; and at the same parliament he was chosen one of the eight noblemen, two of whom were to have the charge of the young queen every three months. On 24 July 1543 he signed a band to support Cardinal Beaton, but his adherence to the cardinal was only temporary, for in 1544 he resisted by force of arms the cardinal's candidate for the provostship of Perth. Ruthven was appointed keeper of the privy seal in July 1546 . On 24 August of the same year he appeared before the privy council with Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell, as caution that Bothwell's ship, the Mary, and other four barks should not take any ships belonging to the Dutch, Flemings, or Hungarians. On 13 September he obtained an heritable grant of the king's house of Perth, of which he was keeper. He died early in December 1552. Family In 1515 he married Janet Haliburton, heiress of the Haliburtons of Dirleton Castle, and sister of Mariotta Haliburton, Countess of Home.

The player who generates the most hate on a mob will be preferentially attacked by that mob. The act of initiating such situation is called \\"getting aggro\\" or \\"pulling aggro.\\" The character with the highest amount of hate relative to his allies has aggro. The threat list or threat table is the ordering of players by the amount of hate they have generated. Some mobs have fight mechanics that will ignore hate completely, change which player has aggro despite hate, or periodically reset the threat list, resetting all hate to 0. Tanks For most characters, hate is an undesirable side effect of their attack on an enemy. However, a type of character called a tank deliberately pulls aggro towards themself, and away from other player characters. To do this, the tank is typically the first to attack an enemy, and may have powers or skills designed to draw the enemy's attention. The tank has a high amount of defense and health to survive constant attacks of mobs. Hate calculation A game may calculate hate generated by a player on a mob based using factors such as: * Whether the mob is set to attack players on sight (aggressive). * The distance between the mob and the player. The area in which a player automatically gets hate or aggro is called the Aggro Radius. * The relative strength of the player compared to the mob. * How much damage has been dealt to the mob by the player. * Debuffs and status effects inflicted on the mob by the player. * Heals and buffs given by the player to other players or NPCs (such as pets) who are attacking the mob. * Status effects on the player, such as invincibility, sleep, and death, which make them more or less favorable to attack. * Hate generating or reducing abilities (such as taunts or invisibility) used by the player. * Time elapsed since the player last generated hate on the NPC. Hate can also be manipulated to deter a mob from attacking. A player may use a hate-reducing ability, ask another player to generate more hate than themself, run away or move to a distant position, or stop generating hate and wait for the mob to attack someone else. In many games, a player who is defeated or killed has the hate mobs have on them reduced to zero.

The book was dedicated to Prince Charles, who later became Habsburg Emperor Charles V. Erasmus wrote the book in 1516, the same year that Thomas More finished his Utopia and three years after Machiavelli had written his advice book for rulers Il Principe. The Principe, however, was not published until 1532, 16 years later. Erasmus stated that teachers should be of gentle disposition and have unimpeachable morals. A good education included all the liberal arts. Like the Roman educator Quintilian, Erasmus was against corporal punishment for unruly students. He stressed the student must be treated as an individual. Erasmus attempted throughout the work to reconcile the writers of antiquity with the Christian ethics of his time. The text was written in part to secure Erasmus a position as Prince Charles's tutor. Rhetoric Erasmus was a philologist, grammarian, theologian, and rhetorician. He is considered a key contributor to the rhetorical tradition because of his humanist approach to pedagogy, literary criticism, his own works (including letters), and oratory. The Education of a Christian Prince highlights rhetoric designed to furnish the best practices for a young man in a critical religious and political position. Rhetoric‚Äôs foundational structure, at the turn of the sixteenth century, included classical teachings from Isocrates, Aristotle, and Cicero. Some of their respective foci and contributions, of which Erasmus would have been keenly aware, are as follows: *Isocrates ‚Äì In his well-known treatise, Against the Sophists, Isocrates rebukes sophists for charging exorbitant fees for promises they could not keep and \\"producing\\" learners who could speak on any subject at length. He, as an upper echelon sophist, consequently, opened a school that would afford him opportunities to teach \\"proper\\" rhetoric and yield model Greek citizens and well-trained leaders. For Isocrates, writing was critical to rhetoric..Translated by George Norlin. *Aristotle ‚Äì In the Art of Rhetoric, Aristotle defines rhetoric as \\"the power to observe the persuasiveness of which any particular matter admits.\\".Translated by James M. May and Jakob Wisse. Among Aristotelian methods of persuasion were; the topoi (places), common particular topics from which an argument can be constructed; three offices of rhetoric: invention, arrangement and style; the three proofs of rhetoric: ethos, based on the speaker‚Äôs or writer‚Äôs character, logos based on inductive or deductive reasoning; and pathos which relies on an audience's sensibility to a particular subject); the three genres of rhetoric: forensic, the judicial, concerned with determining truth or falsity of events that took place in the past; the deliberative, or political, concerned with determining whether or not action should or should not be taken in the future, and epideictic, the ceremonial, and concerned with praise and blame, values/ethics/virtue, and skill in the present). Aristotle founded The Lyceum, a peripatetic school. *Cicero ‚Äì On the Ideal Orator (De Oratore) is a dialogic treatise addressed to Cicero's brother, Quintus, which Cicero refers to as a more mature work than his previously published On Invention (De Inventione). The interlocutors in the dialogue, primarily Crassus and Antonius, posit that the ideal orator has the following qualities: a wealth of knowledge (Crassus); the rhetorical ability to \\"first win people over, second, to instruct them, and third, to stir their feelings\\" (Antonius), a point similar to Aristotle's division of ethos, logos, pathos; is a master of invention and style, including correct language, clarity, distinction, and appropriateness, and eloquence; and uses natural ability with willingness to imitate a great teacher for the sake of effectually perfecting the natural ability and not for the cloning of the teacher. Erasmus uses this knowledge of classical rhetoric in his writing. Erasmus's ethos within The Education of a Christian Prince (Institutio principis christiani), in the Isocratean manner of setting himself apart from potentially incompetent teachers, shows disdain against sophists. In the preface of Christian Prince addressed to Charles the prince, Erasmus states that Isocrates \\"was a sophist, instructing some petty king or rather tyrant, and both were pagans.\\" Erasmus' use of logos and pathos immediately follow when he completes the eschewing of Isocrates: \\"I am a theologian addressing a renowned and upright prince, Christians both of us.\\" A recent critic, Peter Gay describes Erasmus as \\"a true classical spirit in his search for clarity and simplicity, a modern in complexity, an ancestor of the Enlightenment in his critical temper and pacific cosmopolitanism. But, above all, he was a Christian intellectual.\\" And while Cicero was considered the \\"patron saint of the Renaissance era\\" ‚Äì a title that would become fundamentally problematic for a number of Christians because of his pagan beliefs ‚Äì Erasmus came to be known as the \\"prince of humanists\\" esteemed by many of his contemporaries as a \\"man born to bring back literature.\\"Qtd. in Percy Stafford Allen, ed. \\"Erasmi Epistolae.\\" Opus Epistolarum Des. Erasmi Roterdom. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1906-58. 492. Erasmus' stylistic form of writing was often compared to the standards set forth by Cicero, particularly influenced by his De Inventione; however, Erasmus' primary goal for Christian Prince and all of his works, as he argued, was to be seen as \\"a Christian rather than a Ciceronian.\\"Quoted. in Desiderii Erasmi Rotrdami Opera omnia. J. Leclerc, ed. (Leiden, 1703-6; reprint 1961-2). The Christian Prince is an example of Erasmus' rhetorically stylistic mastery that serves as a testament to his ability to imbue the teachings of Christ while embodying Cicero's concept of \\"imitator\\". For example, Christ told his disciples a parable of wheat and tares growing in the same field and that it was not their responsibility, but His, to separate the two (Matt. 13:24-43). Erasmus, a consummate rhetorician, managed to quell the concerns of many fellow Christians by \\"Christianizing\\" pagan ideologies as part of his role in and contribution to the Renaissance humanist tradition. For according to Peter Bietenholz, and in concert with Aristotle‚Äôs idea of lexis, the pure knowledge of language, \\"the humanist, first and last, is a rhetorician, a linguist. His professional devotion as well as skill is aligned to verba (words), not to res (things). His real gesta (deeds) are verba, the words, and not res gestae, the actions of historical significance.\\" Erasmus indeed employs, primarily, deliberative and epideictic forms of rhetoric within Christian Prince, because it has the purpose of a conduct book, also referred to as a courtesy book or hortative and advisory literature. At the time of its publishing, the conduct book was beginning to witness a change in its popularity as a bourgeoning genre though it can be seen in such classics as Plato's Republic and, in Erasmus's own time, with the likes of Machiavelli‚Äôs The Prince and Thomas More‚Äôs Utopia. Christian Prince serves as a guide for the teacher and the prince as well as all court personnel who might have any reason to speak to or with him and espouses Erasmus' rhetorical approach to Christocentric political theories and pedagogical praxes which he refers to as the \\"philosophia Christi.\\" The concept of \\"philosophia Christi,\\" Erasmus' primary topoi in Christian Prince, as defined by Erika Rummel as \\"a life centered on Christ and characterized by inner faith rather than external rites,\\" was introduced more than a decade prior to the Christian Prince in a similar work, the Enchiridion Militis Christiani, (1504), the Handbook (or Dagger) of a Christian Soldier. At the conclusion of the preface, Erasmus, on the basis of this \\"philosophia Christi,\\" admonishes the prince that \\"among the countless distinctions which under God your merit will win for you, it will be no small part of your reputation that Charles was a prince to whom a man need hesitate to offer the picture of a true and upright Christian prince without flattery, knowing that he would either gladly accept it as an excellent prince already, or wisely imitate it as a young man always in search of self-improvement.\\" Throughout the Christian Prince, Erasmus deftly invokes the knowledge, wisdom and ultimately, truth, to be gleaned from other great thinkers of antiquity such as Plato, Seneca, and Plutarch who seems to have influenced Erasmus most, who will point the prince to Truth. Its opening sentence begins with Erasmus positing that \\"wisdom in itself is a wonderful thing ..., and no kind of wisdom is rated more excellent by Aristotle than that which teaches how to be a beneficent prince; for Xenophon ..., rightly considers that there is something beyond human nature, something wholly divine, in absolute rule over free and willing subjects.\\" However, Erasmus never recommends the pagan authors or their works singularly or in isolation because in the next breath, he makes a seamless rhetorical move to remind the prince that of all the requests King Solomon could have made when God told him he would grant whatever he asked, Solomon's prayer was for wisdom to lead God's people. A similar rhetorical move in reverse can be found in a most noteworthy chapter of the treatise, \\"The Prince Must Avoid Flatterers.\\" As Erasmus offers the pedagogue a recommended list of readings for the prince as student, he first lists the proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, and the Book of Wisdom then next the Gospels. The total number of biblical references here is seven. He then recommends works from pagan authors: three from Plutarch the Apophthegms, Moralia, and Lives; writings from Seneca (no specific titles provided, but he does pluralize the suggestion); from Aristotle, the Politics; from Cicero the Offices and Laws; and from Plato, the Republic, but because the work was lost at the time, he recommends his Laws. The pagan number of works surpasses the number of biblical works. Erasmus justifies his approach of dissoi logoi, arguing from two contrary accounts, by persuading the prince to always apply the following caveat: \\"This writer whom you are reading is a pagan and you are a Christian reader; although he has many excellent things to say, he nevertheless does not depict the ideal of a Christian quite accurately, and you must take care not to think that whatever you come across at any point is to be imitated straight away, but instead test everything against the standard of Christ.\\" Although offering an Augustinian-type approach by emphasizing the Christian prince's ability to interpret pagan texts, Erasmus would continue to have strained relations with some Church Fathers regarding his rhetorical methodologies toward Truth. Despite this, the Christian Prince \\"saw ten editions during Erasmus' lifetime and was translated into a number of vernacular languages, which testifies to a general interest in the work.\\" Quotes *\\"Conduct your own rule as if you were striving to ensure that no successor could be your equal, but all the time prepare your children for their future reign as if to ensure that a better man would indeed succeed you.\\" *\\"He acquires most who requires nothing, but commands respect.\\" References External links * Desiderius Erasmus (1516) The Education of a Christian Prince (translated by Lester K.

Career in Russia The Night Before Christmas (1913). Ivan Mozzhukhin was born in Kondol, in the Saratov Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Penza Oblast in Russia), the youngest of four brothers. His mother Rachel Ivanovna Mozzhukhina (n√©e Lastochkina) was the daughter of a Russian Orthodox priest, while his father Ilya Ivanovich Mozzhukhin came from peasants and served as an estate manager for the noble Obolensky family. He inherited this position from his own father ‚Äî a serf whose children were granted freedom as a gratitude for his service.Oleg Sirotin (2014).

Family and fatherland of Ivan Mozzhukhin article from the Notes on Film Studies magazine, main editor Naum Kleiman (2006, in Russian) While all three elder brothers finished seminary, Ivan was sent to the Penza gymnasium for boys and later studied law at the Moscow State University. In 1910, he left academic life to join a troupe of traveling actors from Kiev, with which he toured for a year, gaining experience and a reputation for dynamic stage presence. Upon returning to Moscow, he launched his screen career with the 1911 adaptation of Tolstoy's The Kreutzer Sonata. He also starred in A House in Kolomna (1913, after Pushkin), Pyotr Chardynin directed drama Do You Remember? opposite the popular Russian ballerina Vera Karalli (1914), Nikolay Stavrogin (1915, after Dostoyevsky's The Devils aka The Possessed), The Queen of Spades (1916, after Pushkin) and other adaptations of Russian classics. The Kuleshov Effect Mosjoukine's most lasting contribution to the theoretical concept of film as image is the legacy of his own face in recurring representation of illusory reactions seen in Lev Kuleshov's psychological montage experiment which demonstrated the Kuleshov Effect. In 1918, the first full year of the Russian Revolution, Kuleshov assembled his revolutionary illustration of the application of the principles of film editing out of footage from one of Mosjoukine's Tsarist-era films which had been left behind when he, along with his entire film production company, departed for the relative safety of Crimea in 1917. Career in France At the end of 1919, Mosjoukine arrived in Paris and quickly established himself as one of the top stars of the French silent cinema, starring in one successful film after another. Handsome, tall, and possessing a powerful screen presence, he won a considerable following as a mysterious and exotic romantic figure. The first film of his French career was also his final Russian film. L'Angoissante Aventure (The Harrowing Adventure) was a dramatized record of the difficult and dangerous journey of Russian actors, directors and other film artists as they made their way from Crimea into the chaos of Ottoman Turkey in the midst of the post-World War I fall of the Sultanate. The group was headed by the renowned director Yakov Protazanov and included Mosjoukine's frequent leading lady Natalya Lisenko (billed in France as Nathalie Lissenko), whom he married and later divorced. Their ultimate destination was Paris, which became the new capital for most of the exiled former aristocrats and other refugees escaping the Russian Civil War. The film was completed and released in Paris in November 1920. Father Sergius in the 1917 film. Mosjoukine's film stardom was assured and during the 1920s, his face with the trademark hypnotic stare appeared on covers of film magazines all over Europe. He wrote the screenplays for most of his starring vehicles and directed two of them, L'Enfant du carnaval (Child of the Carnival), released on 29 August 1921 and Le Brasier ardent (The Blazing Inferno), released on 2 November 1923. The leading lady in both films was the then-\\"Madame Mosjoukine\\", Nathalie Lissenko. Brasier, in particular, was highly praised for its innovative and inventive concepts, but ultimately proved too surreal and bizarre to become financially successful. Styled like a semi-comic Kafkaesque nightmare, the film has him playing a detective known only as \\"Z\\" hired by an older husband to follow his adventurous young wife. However, the plot was only the device which Mosjoukine and his assistant director Alexandre Volkoff used to experiment with the audience's perception of reality. Many of the scenes seem to be taking place on sets that are disconcertingly larger than normal and one particularly striking staging has the husband entering the detective agency to find a synchronized line of men, presumably detectives, all wearing tuxedos and gliding about in formation. Mosjoukine received praise for his enthusiastic acting and display of emotion. Surrender in Hollywood According to popular myth, when Rudolph Valentino died on August 23, 1926, Hollywood producers began searching for another face or image that might capture some iota of that unique screen presence radiated by \\"The Great Lover\\". However, Mosjoukine was signed by Universal before Valentino's death, as the August 14, 1926 edition of Motion Picture News mentions Mosjoukine's role in Michel Strogoff as Universal had just announced that they were bringing the film to the American market. Universal's Laemmle was mentioned as having signed Mosjoukine to come to America that fall. A few of the French productions which starred Mosjoukine were seen in large U.S. cities, where multitudes of cinemas regularly presented European films, but he was a generally unfamiliar persona to the large majority of American audiences. Universal's Carl Laemmle, who had employed Valentino as a supporting actor in two 1919-1920 films, found out that Mosjoukine was frequently described by the European press as the Russian Valentino. However, as it turned out, Surrender, filmed in the summer of 1927, did not trust Mosjukine to carry the storyline. He was only the film's co-star, with the top billing and the central role going to Mary Philbin, a popular leading lady of the period who, eighteen months earlier, had the showy role of Christine, the focus of Lon Chaney's obsession and love in The Phantom of the Opera. The recent Russian Revolution was a popular film subject of the time, with the 1926 John Barrymore-Camilla Horn teaming in The Tempest and the Emil Jannings vehicle The Last Command, released three months after Surrender, being two examples of the genre. Since Laemmle's new star was a genuine survivor of the Revolution, it seemed only natural that the story would be set in that milieu. Symptomatic of Mosjoukine's co-star status, he does not even appear in the first fifteen minutes of the film, which are occupied with the depiction of life in an Eastern European Jewish settlement on the eve of World War I. Eventually, at the centerpiece of the plot Mary Philbin, as the virginal daughter of the village rabbi, is confronted with the startling choice of willingly \\"surrendering\\" her maidenhood to Mosjoukine's aristocratic leader of the Cossack detachment sent to wipe out her village, or refusing and seeing him carry out his assignment. While this type of personality fitted into Valentino's past Son of the Sheik characterization of a dominant, forceful lover who initially takes women against their will, until they melt under the radiance of his sheer animal magnetism, it ran against Mosjoukine's European Casanova image as a fatalistically irresistible paramour to whom women flock and \\"surrender\\" without any hint of force or threat, but simply because of their inability to resist. This basic misunderstanding of the dissimilarity between Valentino and Mosjoukine combined with journeyman direction by Edward Sloman and Mary Philbin's unresponsiveness and lack of chemistry with her leading man, consigned the film to a tepid reception by the critics and the public. Although moderately profitable, it was not the money-making hit that Laemmle expected. Mosjoukine received some good notices, but a number of critics doubted his suitability for American audiences. An even more ominous note, however, was sounded at the film's Broadway premiere on 10 October 1927. Another film, playing across the street, had its premiere four days earlier, on 6 October. The Jazz Singer was attracting much bigger audiences than Surrender and, as it was ushering in voice-on-film, would soon sound the death knell for Mosjoukine's career as a silent film star, as his heavy Russian accent eventually dealt a crippling blow to his hopes of continuing in talkies. Return to Europe After the unsuccessful attempt at a Hollywood career, Mosjoukine returned to Europe. The reminder of his film career, appearing in a new film every year until at least 1936, was spent in Europe. He appeared mainly in German films in the last years of the Weimar Republic, moving to France after the rise of the Nazis to power. In both countries he was often given roles in films with a Russian background. Many of his films were directed by fellow Russian emigres Vladimir Strizhevsky, Victor Tourjansky, and Alexandre Volkoff. Personal life Mosjoukine had three elder brothers. Alexander Mozzhukhin (1878‚Äî1972) was a famous opera singer who also left Russia for Paris in 1926. After his death his wife Cleo Carini returned to the Soviet Union, bringing her husband's archives along with her which included many documents. Among them was an autobiography and many letters from his family members, including Ivan. They are currently stored in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art and in several museums.Alexander Mosjoukine at Pinterest Mosjoukine's second brother Aleksey (born 1880) served as an officer in the Imperial Russian Army and was later enrolled to the Red Army. In 1931 he was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison for Anti-Soviet agitation. In 1937 he was arrested for the second time on the same account and by the NKVD troika's decision sentenced to death. Konstantin Mozzhukhin (born 1882) was also an army officer who served in the Imperial Russian Navy. In 1935 he and his father were arrested and sent to Yrgyz in the Kazakh SSR. In 1937 he was arrested for the second time, also for Anti-Soviet agitation, and sentenced to ten years of labor camps. The date of his death is unknown.The restored names. Russian book of memory project by the National Library of Russia (2003‚Äî2017, in Russian) Mosjoukine was officially married three times. His first wife was the Russian actress Natalya Lisenko (1884‚Äì1960). They married in the first half of the 1910s and divorced in 1927. In 1928 Mosjoukine married a Dutch actress Agnes Petersen (1906‚Äî1973). His third wife was a French actress of Russian origin Tania F√©dor (1905‚Äì1985), although they were married only for a brief period of time. Antonina Variyash. Ivan Mozzhukhin. Unfamiliar sons biographical article in the Caravan of Stories monthly magazine, December 28, 2015 (in Russian) As a teenager Mosjoukine became romantically involved with Olga Bronitskaya (born Telegina) ‚Äî an actress from the popular traveling troupe led by her brother Petr Zarechny. In 1908 she gave birth to their illegitimate son Aleksandr who was registered as the son of Petr Zarechny under his official family name. Thus the boy was raised as Aleksandr Petrovich Telegin, although he was made aware of his real father. For several years Mosjoukine traveled with his civil wife and his son before returning to Moscow and marrying Natalya Lisenko. According to Telegin, his father always supported them by sending letters, money and packages until his name came under a ban in the Soviet Union. Telegin and his family lived in Moscow, although they had to conceal their origin. To this day he remains Mosjoukine's only confirmed offspring. French novelist Romain Gary claimed that his birth was the result of an affair between Mosjoukine and his mother Nina Owczy≈Ñska, a Polish-Jewish actress who later married Arieh Kacew. In 1960 he wrote a novelized autobiographical account of his mother's struggles and triumphs, La promesse de l'aube (Promise at Dawn), which became the basis for an English-language play and a French-American film. The play, Samuel A. Taylor's First Love, opened on Broadway at the Morosco Theatre on Christmas Day 1961 and closed on 13 January 1962, after 24 performances. In 1970, returning to its original title, it was adapted for the screen and directed by Jules Dassin as a vehicle for his wife Melina Mercouri (then aged 49), who played Nina. Dassin, who was 59 years old at the time, chose to play Mosjoukine himself in the single scene that the character appears in the film. Death Ivan Mosjoukine died of tuberculosis in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic. All available sources give his age as 49 and year of birth as 1889. However, his gravestone at the Russian cemetery in the Parisian suburb of Sainte- Genevieve-des-Bois is inscribed with the year 1887. Selected filmography *The Kreutzer Sonata (1911, dir.

The screenplay by Ronald Harwood is based on Charles Dickens‚Äôs 1838 novel of the same name. The film was preceded by numerous adaptations of the Dickens book, including several feature films, three television films, two miniseries, and a stage musical that became an Academy Award-winning film. The film premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival on 11 September 2005 before going into limited release in the United States on 23 September. Plot In the 1830s, a young orphan (Oliver Twist) is forcibly brought to a workhouse in England on his ninth birthday. He and other resident children are treated poorly and given very little food. Facing starvation, the boys select Oliver through a lottery to ask for more food at the next meal, which he does. This results in Oliver being chastised, and one workhouse official decided to have him hanged, but in the end he was offered along with ¬£5 (roughly ¬£650 today) to anyone willing to have him as an apprentice. In the end Oliver is sent to Mr. Sowerberry, a coffin-maker, whose wife and senior apprentice take an instant dislike to the newcomer. After more poor treatment, Oliver snaps and attacks Noah, the snotty older apprentice, for having insulted his mother. Noah howls instantly and brings Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte rushing in to drag Oliver away and lock him in the cold dark cellar. The violent behavior of the orphan is duly brought to the notice of Mr. Sowerberry. Oliver is beaten, and knowing his life with the Sowerberrys will only get worse, he escapes on foot early the next morning. With little food, Oliver determines to walk 70 miles to London. After a week of travel, he arrives at the city, barefoot and penniless. He meets Jack Dawkins, or \\"The Artful Dodger,\\" a boy-thief who takes Oliver to his home and hideout at Saffron Hill that he shares with many other young pickpockets and their eccentric elderly leader, Fagin. Soon, Oliver is being groomed to join their gang. On his first outing with the pickpockets, two of the boys steal a man‚Äôs handkerchief and Oliver is arrested. However he is proven innocent by an eyewitness, and the owner of the handkerchief (the wealthy Mr. Brownlow) takes pity on Oliver. Brownlow, believing that Oliver is innocent, informally adopts him, giving him new clothes and the promise of a good education. However, while out running an errand for Brownlow, Oliver is forcibly returned to the pickpocket gang by Fagin‚Äôs associate, the evil Bill Sikes, and the young prostitute Nancy (who is in an abusive relationship with Sikes). Fagin and Sikes worry that Oliver would \\"peach,\\" and tell the authorities about their criminal activity. Oliver is put under supervision until Bill Sikes discovers the boy's connection to the rich Mr. Brownlow. At midnight, Sikes and his accomplice, Toby Crackit, force Oliver to aid them in robbing Brownlow's house. They are discovered and Oliver is wounded in a brief shootout between Brownlow and Sikes. As the three escape, Bill decides to murder Oliver to ensure his silence, but falls into a nearby river before he can take action. Sikes survives his near-drowning, but is confined to bed with a heavy fever. Fagin, despite treating Oliver kindly, remains crime-focused and plots with Sikes to kill Oliver after Sikes has recovered. Nancy has a maternal love for Oliver and does not want to see him hurt. She drugs Bill, and goes to Brownlow's house where she arranges to have him meet her on London Bridge at midnight so she can provide information about Oliver. At the meeting, Nancy cautiously reveals that Oliver is staying with Fagin, and that the authorities will easily find them. Brownlow leaves to call the police. The Artful Dodger, who had been sent by a suspicious Fagin to spy on Nancy, has heard everything and is bullied by Bill Sikes to give up the information. Sikes is furious at Nancy's betrayal, and brutally beats her to death. The next day, information about Oliver and Fagin appear in the newspaper, along with Nancy's murder and the fact that Sikes is a suspect. Sikes's ever-present dog, Bullseye, is a dead giveaway to his identity. After unsuccessfully trying to kill the dog, Sikes takes up residence with Toby Crackit. Fagin, Oliver, and the boys are hiding there too, after escaping their previous location. Bullseye escapes his master's cruelty, and leads a group of police and locals to the group's hideout. Eventually, Dodger, outraged at Sikes for killing the good-hearted Nancy, reveals their location to authorities. Sikes takes Oliver onto the roof, knowing that they won't shoot if the boy is with him. When trying to scale the building using a rope, Sikes, distracted by his dog, loses his footing and accidentally hangs himself to death. Some time later, Oliver is living comfortably with Mr. Brownlow again. Fagin was arrested for his pick pocketing actions, and Oliver wishes to visit him in jail. Brownlow takes him to the prison, where they find Fagin ranting and wailing in his cell. Oliver is distraught at Fagin's fate, as he had been something of a father figure to him. Oliver tells Fagin \\"You were kind to me,\\" but soon, their bond breaks when a policeman tells Oliver to leave, thinking that Fagin, wanting to escape execution, can play tricks on the boy's mind. As Mr. Brownlow escorts a tearful Oliver to his own carriage, gallows are being set up in the courtyard. Townspeople begin to gather to watch Fagin's execution, while Mr. Brownlow and Oliver leave to start their new lives afresh.

Following, he was anxious to make a film his children could enjoy. He realized nearly forty years had passed since Oliver Twist had been adapted for a feature film and felt it was time for a new version. Screenwriter Ronald Harwood, with whom he had collaborated on The Pianist, welcomed the opportunity to work on the first Dickens project in his career. For authenticity, all scenes featuring pickpocket skills were choreographed by stage pickpocket James Freedman and magician Martyn Rowland. The film was shot in Prague, Beroun, and ≈Ωatec in the Czech Republic. Polanski and Harwood entirely omitted the Maylie family from their film. Like the musical, but unlike Lean, they also omitted Monks, as well as the entire subplot of a conspiracy to defraud Oliver of the inheritance money that his father left him. Oliver now has no origin, but is an anonymous orphan like the rest of Fagin's gang. (See more here.) To fill up the gap left by the absence of Monks and the Maylies, the film creates a subplot wherein Fagin's intentions toward Oliver become murderous and he plots with Sikes to actually kill the boy, which never happens in the novel. Reception The film received mixed to positive reviews, holding a 'fresh' 60% score on Rotten Tomatoes. The consensus reads 'Polanski's version of Dickens' classic won't have audiences asking for more because while polished and directed with skill, the movie's a very impersonal experience.' Review aggregate website Metacritic further assigned the film a score of 65, signifying 'generally favorable reviews.' A. O. Scott of The New York Times called it a \\"bracingly old-fashioned\\" film that \\"does not embalm its source with fussy reverence\\" but \\"rediscovers its true and enduring vitality.\\" He added, \\"the look of the movie... is consistent with its interpretation of Dickens's worldview, which could be plenty grim but which never succumbed to despair. There is just enough light, enough grace, enough beauty, to penetrate the gloom and suggest the possibility of redemption. The script... is at once efficient and ornate, capturing Dickens's narrative dexterity and his ear for the idioms of English speech.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was similarly positive; he lauded the film as \\"visually exact and detailed without being too picturesque.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised it as a \\"grounded and unusually matter-of- fact adaptation,\\" continuing, \\"Polanski does justice to Dickens' moral universe, in which the motives and worldview of even the worst people are made comprehensible.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded the film B+ and commented, \\"On the face of it, Roman Polanski's Oliver Twist is in the tradition of every faithful Oliver Twist ever filmed ‚Äî a photogenic, straightforward, CliffsNotes staging of Charles Dickens' harrowing story... Yet precisely because this is by Roman Polanski, it's irresistible to read his sorrowful and seemingly classical take, from a filmmaker known as much for the schisms in his personal history as for the lurches in his work, as something much more personal and poignant.\\" However, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film two out of four stars, calling it \\"drab and unfeeling\\" while \\"lacking the Polanski stamp.\\" He further felt Barney Clark's performance as Oliver was \\"bereft of personality.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety echoed Travers' sentiments about Clark, labelling him \\"disappointingly wan and unengaging,\\" while writing that the film was \\"conventional, straightforward\\" and \\"a respectable literary adaptation, but [lacking] dramatic urgency and intriguing undercurrents.\\" In the UK press, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian opined that while \\"[Polanski's] Oliver Twist does not flag or lose its way and is always watchable, the book's original power and force have not been rediscovered.\\" Philip French of The Observer wrote that the film was \\"generally disappointing, though by no means badly acted,\\" and alleged that it lacked \\"any serious point of view about individuality, society, community.\\" DVD release Sony Pictures released the film on DVD on 24 January 2006. It is in anamorphic widescreen format with audio tracks and subtitles in English and French. Bonus features include Twist by Polanski, in which the director reflects on the making of the film; The Best of Twist, which includes interviews with production designer Allan Starski, costume designer Anna B. Sheppard, cinematographer Pawe≈Ç Edelman, editor Herv√© de Luze, and composer Rachel Portman; and Kidding with Oliver Twist, which focuses on the young actors in the cast.

As the form of agammaglobulinemia that is X-linked, it is much more common in males. In people with XLA, the white blood cell formation process does not generate mature B cells, which manifests as a complete or near-complete lack of proteins called gamma globulins, including antibodies, in their bloodstream. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), which defend the body from infections by sustaining a humoral immunity response. Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections. A mutation occurs at the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene that leads to a severe block in B cell development (at the pre-B cell to immature B cell stage) and a reduced immunoglobulin production in the serum. Btk is particularly responsible for mediating B cell development and maturation through a signaling effect on the B cell receptor BCR. Patients typically present in early childhood with recurrent infections, in particular with extracellular, encapsulated bacteria. XLA is deemed to have a relatively low incidence of disease, with an occurrence rate of approximately 1 in 200,000 live births and a frequency of about 1 in 100,000 male newborns. It has no ethnic predisposition. XLA is treated by infusion of human antibody. Treatment with pooled gamma globulin cannot restore a functional population of B cells, but it is sufficient to reduce the severity and number of infections due to the passive immunity granted by the exogenous antibodies.X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia Patient and Family Handbook for The Primary Immune Diseases. Third Edition. 2001. Published by the Immune Deficiency Foundation XLA is caused by a mutation on the X chromosome (Xq21.3-q22) of a single gene identified in 1993 which produces an enzyme known as Bruton's tyrosine kinase, or Btk. XLA was first characterized by Dr. Ogden Bruton in a ground-breaking research paper published in 1952 describing a boy unable to develop immunities to common childhood diseases and infections.. Reproduced in It is the first known immune deficiency, and is classified with other inherited (genetic) defects of the immune system, known as primary immunodeficiency disorders. Signs and symptoms Affects males 50% of the time if mother is a carrier for the gene. Children are generally asymptomatic until 6‚Äì9 months of age when maternal IgG decreases. Present with recurrent infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, hepatitis virus, and enterovirus CNS infections. Examination shows lymphoid hypoplasia (tonsils and adenoids, no splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy). There is significant decrease in all immunoglobulins. Genetics X-chromosome Most antibodies are gamma globulins. Antibodies are made mainly by plasma cells, which are daughter cells of the B cell line. The Btk enzyme plays an essential role in the maturation of B cells in the bone marrow, and when mutated, immature pro-B lymphocytes are unable to develop into pre-B lymphocytes, which normally develop into mature (naive) B cells that leave the bone marrow into the blood stream. The disorder is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion (as the gene linked to it is on the X chromosome) and is almost entirely limited to the sons of asymptomatic female carriers. This is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome, while females have two copies; one normal copy of an X chromosome can compensate for mutations in the other X chromosome, so they are less likely to be symptomatic. There is 30‚Äì50% chance of XLA patients having a positive family history of genetic inheritance. The rest of the cases occur as random mutations. If a carrier female gives birth to a male child, there is a 50% chance that the male will have XLA. A carrier female has a 25% chance overall of giving birth to an affected male child. An XLA patient will pass on the gene, and all of his daughters will be XLA carriers, meaning that any male grandchildren from an XLA patient's daughters have a 50% chance of inheriting XLA. A female XLA patient can arise only as the child of an XLA patient and a carrier mother. XLA can also rarely result from a spontaneous mutation in the fetus of a non-carrier mother. Diagnosis XLA diagnosis usually begins due to a history of recurrent infections, mostly in the respiratory tract, through childhood. This is due to humoral immunodeficiency. The diagnosis is probable when blood tests show the complete lack of circulating B cells (determined by the B cell marker CD19 and/or CD20), as well as low levels of all antibody classes, including IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE and IgD. When XLA is suspected, it is possible to do a Western Blot test to determine whether the Btk protein is being expressed. Results of a genetic blood test confirm the diagnosis and will identify the specific Btk mutation, however its cost prohibits its use in routine screening for all pregnancies. Women with an XLA patient in their family should seek genetic counseling before pregnancy. Although the symptoms of a XLA and other primary immune diseases (PID) include repeated and often severe infections, the average time for a diagnosis of a PID can be up to 10 years. Treatment The most common treatment for XLA is an intravenous infusion of immunoglobulin (IVIg, human IgG antibodies) every week, for life. IVIg is a human product extracted and pooled from thousands of blood donations. IVIg does not cure XLA but increases the patient's lifespan and quality of life, by generating passive immunity, and boosting the immune system. With treatment, the number and severity of infections is reduced. With IVIg, XLA patients may live a relatively healthy life. A patient should attempt reaching a state where his IgG blood count exceeds 800 mg/kg. The dose is based on the patient's weight and IgG blood- count. Muscle injections of immunoglobulin (IMIg) were common before IVIg was prevalent, but are less effective and much more painful; hence, IMIg is now uncommon. Subcutaneous treatment (SCIg) was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is recommended in cases of severe adverse reactions to the IVIg treatment. Antibiotics are another common supplementary treatment. Local antibiotic treatment (drops, lotions) are preferred over systemic treatment (pills) for long-term treatment, if possible. One of the future prospects of XLA treatment is gene therapy, which could potentially cure XLA. Gene therapy technology is still in its infancy and may cause severe complications such as cancer and even death. Moreover, the long-term success and complications of this treatment are, as yet, unknown. =Other considerations= It is not recommended and dangerous for XLA patients to receive live attenuated vaccines such as live polio, or the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine). Special emphasis is given to avoiding the oral live attenuated SABIN-type polio vaccine that has been reported to cause polio to XLA patients. Furthermore, it is not known if active vaccines in general have any beneficial effect on XLA patients as they lack normal ability to maintain immune memory. XLA patients are specifically susceptible to viruses of the Enterovirus family, and mostly to: polio virus, coxsackie virus (hand, foot, and mouth disease) and Echoviruses. These may cause severe central nervous system conditions as chronic encephalitis, meningitis and death. An experimental anti-viral agent, pleconaril, is active against picornaviruses. XLA patients, however, are apparently immune to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as they lack mature B cells (and so HLA co-receptors) needed for the viral infection. Patients with XLA are also more likely to have a history of septic arthritis. It is not known if XLA patients are able to generate an allergic reaction, as they lack functional IgE antibodies. There is no special hazard for XLA patients in dealing with pets or outdoor activities. Unlike in other primary immunodeficiencies XLA patients are at no greater risk for developing autoimmune illnesses. Agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is similar to the primary immunodeficiency disorder Hypogammaglobulinemia (CVID), and their clinical conditions and treatment are almost identical. However, while XLA is a congenital disorder, with known genetic causes, CVID may occur in adulthood and its causes are not yet understood. In addition, to X-linked agammaglobulinemia a couple of autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia gene mutations have been described including mutations in IGHM , IGLL1, CD79A/B , BLNK and deletion of the deletion of the terminal 14q32.33 chromosom. XLA was also historically mistaken as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), a much more severe immune deficiency (\\"Bubble boys\\").A strain of laboratory mouse, XID, is used to study XLA. These mice have a mutated version of the mouse Btk gene, and exhibit a similar, yet milder, immune deficiency as in XLA.

The University College Players (or Univ Players for short) are the theatrical society of University College, Oxford. History The first production was in May 1941 when Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors was performed in co-operation with Merton College. Peter Bayley was the senior member from the start till the 1960s. After the Second World War, Univ Players was re-founded with a production of Measure for Measure in 1946. In 1952, a young Maggie Smith appeared in a production of He Who Gets Slapped by the Russian playwright Leonid Andreyev, directed by Peter Bayley at the Clarendon Press Institute, after attending a theatrical training scheme and performing in Twelfth Night at the Oxford Playhouse. Michael York (then Michael Johnson) was a Univ Players member in the early 1960s, before graduating with a degree in English in 1964. Peter Sissons, later to become a newscaster, was Treasurer of the Univ Players during his time studying at University College in the 1960s. John Albery took over from Peter Bayley as the senior member of the Players during the 1960s, after his appointment as a chemistry don at University College. He organised the Univ Revue for many years. The March 1963 production of A Man for All Seasons at the Oxford Playhouse was especially successful. In 1974, Jon Plowman directed a musical version of Zuleika Dobson at the Oxford Playhouse, with a script by Reggie Oliver and music by Michael Brand. In the late 1970s, the Univ Players produced successful outdoor summer productions of The Seagull (1976, in St Hilda's meadow), A Midsummer Night's Dream and an adaptation of Alice in Wonderland (1977 and 1978, in the grounds of Magdalen College School by Magdalen Bridge). More recently they have had annual outdoor summer productions in the garden of the Master's Lodgings. Recent Productions include Sheridan's The School for Scandal in 2003, Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound in 2009, and Congreve's The Way of the World in 2010.

Since the Turkish invasion in 1974, it has increased in size and status, primarily due to the migration of refugees fleeing from the north. Many workers in the tourist sectors of Protaras and Ayia Napa live in Paralimni, which is now the temporary administrative centre of the Famagusta District and the biggest municipality of the district under the control of the internationally-recognised government of Cyprus. History The word Paralimni means \\"by the lake\\". Historically, the town was built on the shores of a shallow lake which filled with water only in the winter. At the beginning of the 20th century, the whole lakebed was reclaimed for agricultural purposes. Paralimni has not always been where it is now, and was built originally on a hill situated between Deryneia and its present location. In the 15th century, it was moved inland to avoid detection by pirates. It is said that the first people to settle in Paralimni arrived just after the capture of the nearby town of Famagusta by the Ottoman Turks in 1571. The first settlement was called Saint Demetrius, and this place still bears his name today. In 1986, after a referendum, the area was declared a municipality with the name \\"Paralimni\\". In May 1986, the first elections were held for the office of mayor and municipal council; Nikos Vlittis was elected the first mayor, and served from 1986 to 2006. In December 2006, Vlittis lost the election to Andreas Evaggelou, who served as mayor until 2011. The town is a stronghold for the Democratic Rally, a centre-right party whose member and former leader Nicos Anastasiades is the current president of Cyprus. Architecturally, Paralimni has been nondescript, as very little remains of the original village. Outside of the town centre, most houses are little more than small rectangular blocks; this is compensated for by their attractive gardens, especially when the trees are in bloom. Younger generations who earn higher salaries have been spending larger amounts of money on the construction of more modern and attractive houses in the town. At the heart of Paralimni lies a shopping centre and a small entertainment scene, including modern cafes and bars. Because Paralimni has rapidly grown in size, Cyprus' biggest food retailers such as Carrefour have built or rented branches there. There are also many local supermarkets. The countryside surrounding Paralimni has red soil rich in zinc, which is famous for producing highly nutritious and flavourful potatoes. It is also known for its picturesque windmills, which are used to draw water from underground aquifers to irrigate the surrounding land. Many of these windmills are now derelict, having been replaced by electric or diesel-powered pumps. Before the rise of tourism, the rich agricultural land surrounding Paralimni was the source of its wealth, and is still of great importance today. Sports Enosis Neon Paralimni FC, which plays in the Cypriot First Division, is the football team of the town. There is also a Conference team in Paralimni called Anorthosis Paralimniou. Protaras Protaras (; ) is a predominantly tourist resort which comes under the administrative jurisdiction of Paralimni Municipality.

Covering an area of 327 square kilometres, it had a population of 14,596 at the 1996 census. The town is built on the banks of the Ba River, after which it is named. For a long time, Ba was famous for its single lane bridge which caused major traffic problems. The old bridge was washed away in the floods of 1990s and a new bridge built downstream. This resulted in the main highway (King's Road) bypassing Ba Town. Jiaxing City in China is Ba Town's sister city.  Economy  Ba is an agricultural centre, populated mostly by Indo-Fijians, which makes it a cultural point for tourists. Sugar cane has long been the mainstay of the local economy, but some manufacturing projects have been established over the past fifteen years. Ba is part of the larger Ba Province, geographically the largest of Fiji's fourteen Provinces. The town is also the home of some of Fiji's wealthiest families who own some of the country's most successful business houses.  History  Ba was incorporated as a Town in 1939, and is governed by a 15-member Town Council, whose members elect a mayor from among themselves. In 1987, Ahmed Bhamji was elected mayor at the age of 37, which at the time made him the youngest mayor in the country. At the last municipal election held in 2005, 14 of the 15 seats were won by the National Federation Party, with the remaining seat going to an independent candidate. The mayor was Parveen Bala until the year 2010. Since then, the office of Mayor has been vacant, and Ba, along with other towns, has been under the control of an Administrator instead. Prominent landmarks include the Rarawai Mill (on the outskirts of the town) and a large mosque near the river in the heart of the town. There is also a giant soccer ball in the heart of the town, which symbolizes that Ba is one of the best soccer teams in Fiji. Ba is also known as \\"Soccer Crazy Town\\" for its many wins in the national tournaments like IDC and BOG. Ba was also declared to have fallen in the red zone of Cyclone Winston which made landfall on 20 February 2016 and claimed 49 lives across Fiji.

Swein's grandson was Sir Walter Ruthven who was the first to adopt the name Ruthven. =Wars of Scottish Independence= Sir Walter Ruthven swore fealty to Edward I of England in 1291 and 1296. However, in 1297, he had led thirty men to help William Wallace at the siege of Perth. Ruthven was also with Christopher Seaton when Jedburgh was reclaimed from the English. In 1313, Perth was recaptured and Robert the Bruce appointed Sir William Ruthven to be sheriff of the royal burgh, which was then called St Johnston. =15th and 16th centuries= A descendant of Sir William Ruthven, Sir William Ruthven of Balkernoch, spent three years as a hostage in England for the ransom of James I of Scotland. This William Ruthven was a substantial nobleman. His income was stated to be about four hundred merks annually, which was about ¬£100 at the time. In 1488, his great-grandson was created a Lord of Parliament with the title Lord Ruthven, by James III of Scotland. He married twice and his sons by his first wife were granted a letter of legitimization in 1480. The eldest of the sons was William, Master of Ruthven, who was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Feud with Clan Charteris The Charterises of Kinfauns are said to have received their lands as a reward for supporting Robert the Bruce against the English.Way, George and Squire, Romily. Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 100 - 101. However they came into a feud with the Ruthvens who often disputed the authority of the Charterises. The Ruthvens held considerable sway over Perth from their Huntingtower Castle. In 1544, Patrick, Lord Ruthven, was elected as Provost of Perth but at the intervention of Cardinal Beaton, Ruthven was deprived of the office and Charteris of Kinfauns was appointed instead. The city refused to acknowledge Charteris and barred the gates against him. Charteris along with Lord Gray and the Clan Leslie then attacked the town. However, they were repulsed by the Ruthvens, who were assisted by the Clan Moncreiffe. As a result, Ruthven remained Provost of Perth until 1584, when William Ruthven, Earl of Gowrie was executed. John Charteris had been killed by the earl's heir on Edinburgh High Street in 1552. Murder of David Rizzio In 1556, Patrick Ruthven, 3rd Lord Ruthven, and his son, William, were among the co-conspirators of Lord Darnley when Mary, Queen of Scot's favorite David Rizzio was killed in her presence at Holyrood Palace. Both Ruthvens fled to England when abandoned by Darnley. William returned and succeeded to the family title having received a royal pardon. He was among the people who conducted the queen to Loch Leven Castle, where she was forced to abdicate. Ruthven was also the Treasurer of Scotland during the king's minority and in 1581 was created William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie. Ruthven Raid In 1582, Ruthven, now the Earl of Gowrie, abducted James VI of Scotland in order to remove him from the influence of the Earl of Lennox and Earl of Arran. This became known as the \\"Ruthven Raid\\" or Raid of Ruthven. The king was detained for ten months and, when he was finally released, he appeared forgiving but Gowrie was later arrested in 1584 and beheaded for treason. Gowrie Conspiracy In 1586, the Ruthven estates were restored to William's son, James Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie. However, James Ruthven died just two years later aged thirteen and was succeeded by his brother, John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie. It is alleged that John practiced Black magic. In 1600, he and his brother Alexander were murdered in their town house in Perth. This became known as the \\"Gowrie Conspiracy\\". The Ruthven brothers were declared by Parliament to be traitors although there is little evidence, if anything, of what they were planning. The Ruthven name was decreed out of existence. =17th century, Thirty Years' War and Civil War= In 1651, Sir Thomas Ruthven, who descended from the second Lord Ruthven, partly restored the family's reputation when he was raised in the peerage as Lord Ruthven of Freeland. Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Brentford (c. 1573‚Äì1651), was a collateral descendant of Sir William Ruthven, 1st Lord Ruthven. He fought and negotiated on behalf of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, King of Sweden, during the Thirty Years' War. In Germany, he fought alongside his nephews, Colonel Frances Ruthven and Major General John Ruthven.Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648 (London, 2014), pp.80-90 Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Brentford also fought on behalf of King Charles I during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, bringing both Colonel Frances Ruthven and Major General John Ruthven into service with him.Murdoch & Grosjean (2014), p.97. Sir Thomas Ruthven, 1st Lord Ruthven of Freeland (d. 1673), on whom Charles II of England bestowed the title of Lord Ruthven of Freeland in 1651. His son was David Ruthven, 2nd Lord Ruthven of Freeland. =18th to 20th century= *David Ruthven, 2nd Lord Ruthven of Freeland, died unmarried in April, 1701. The title of Baroness Ruthven was assumed by his sister: * Jean (d. 1722), although according to some authorities the peerage had become extinct. It was, however, assumed in 1722 by: * William Cunynghame of Cunynghamhead (d. 1722) William was Lady Jean's nephew, her closest heir. William died in October of 1722 without an heir and was succeeded by his niece Lady Isobel: * Isobel (d. 1732), wife of James Johnson, who took the name of Ruthven on succeeding to the family estates; and their son: * James Ruthven (d. 1783), took the title and was allowed to vote at the elections of Scots representative peers. In 1853 the barony again descended to a female: * Mary Elizabeth Thornton (c. 1784‚Äì1864), the wife of Walter Hore (d. 1878). She and her husband took the name of Hore-Ruthven, and their grandson: * Walter James Hore-Ruthven (b. 1838), became the 8th baron in 1864. His second son: * Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie (1872‚Äì1955), through meritorious service (including as Governor-General of Australia), regained the family title (first as Baron Gowrie, 1934, and then as Earl of Gowrie, 1944).

It was founded in 1906 by car building and racing enthusiasts, and is most famous for being the organising entity behind the annual Le Mans 24 Hours race. The ACO also lobbies on behalf of French drivers on such issues as road building and maintenance, the availability of driving schools and road safety classes, and the incorporation of technical innovations into new vehicles. It also runs a roadside assistance service for its members. History The ACO's history begins with the Automobile Club de la Sarthe, the ancestor of today's ACO, which was founded in the town of Le Mans. In 1906 that group included Am√©d√©e Boll√©e and Paul Jamin, winner of the 1897 Paris-Dieppe race in a L√©on Boll√©e tricar.Official Program, 24 Heures du Mans, 13‚Äì14 June 2009, Page 97. With the help of the larger Automobile Club de France they organised a race on local public roads, on a 65-mile triangular course connecting Le Mans with Saint- Calais and La Fert√©-Bernard. The 12-lap race, titled the Grand Prix de l'ACF, was held over two days and won by Ferenc Szisz driving a Renault,Joe Saward, The World Atlas of Motor Racing, Page 35, Hamlyn, 1989. This race, the first Grand Prix, would eventually become the French Grand Prix. After World War I, the ACO turned its attention to designing a shorter circuit on public roads to the south of the city. The organisation's chief secretary Georges Durand, together with magazine editor Charles Faroux of La Vie Automobile and tyre manufacturer Emile Coquille, came up with the idea for a 24-hour race. The first Le Mans 24 Hours was held on 26 May 1923.C. Clutton & J. Stanford, The Vintage Motor Car, Page 201, B.T. Batsford Ltd., London, 1961. The very first entry was lodged with the ACO by John Duff on a Bentley.Georges Fraichard, The Le Mans Story, Page 121, The Sportsman's Book Club, 1956. = World War Two and aftermath = The Le Mans circuit was occupied by the Royal Air Force in 1940 and then by the Germans at the end of that year. Le Mans was liberated in August, 1944, but it was almost five years before the 24 Hours took place again. Following the war, the grounds of the ACO and the circuit were in ruins, bombed by the Allies and further destroyed by the Germans. The ACO set about the task of reconstruction, aided by Government Minister and Sarthe d√©put√©e Christian Pineau who provided the first millions. In addition the ACO launched a loan.Georges Fraichard, The Le Mans Story, Page 58, The Sportsman's Book Club, 1956. In 1946 the British Racing Drivers' Club opened a \\"Le Mans Fund\\" for the benefit of the ACO, raising a grand total of ¬£358 and 11 shillings, to assist with the rehabilitation of the facilities at the Le Mans circuit.Motor Sport, June 1946, Page 121; See also: Motor Sport, July 1946, Page 147; Motor Sport, September 1946, Page 201. Rebuilding of the circuit started on February 7, 1949, and the first post-war event at Le Mans was held on 25-26 June of that year.Motor Sport, July 1949, Pages 270-271, 274-276.

It led to many actions by the ACO to subsequently change buildings and the procedures used at the circuit, as well as to redesign the pit lane and front stretch where the accident occurred. It also led to a change of ACO rules for the type of cars permitted in the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the following years, as well as applying a fuel-consumption formula.Motor Year Book 1957, Temple Press, Pages 166-171.

Tenser is a former member of both the Citadel of Eight and the Circle of Eight. In Dungeons Age of Worms adventure path, Tenser is referred to as \\"Manzorian\\". Creative origins Tenser, an anagram of \\"Ernest\\", was initially a wizard player character created and played by Gary Gygax's son Ernie, one of the first two characters that played the game now known as Dungeons & Dragons. In the fall of 1972, Gary Gygax was working to create rules for a new type of game based on a demonstration he had been given by Dave Arneson. In order to provide a playtest environment in which to develop these rules, Gygax designed his own castle, \\"Castle Greyhawk\\", and prepared the first level of a dungeon that lay beneath it. Two of his children, Ernie and Elise, were the first players, and Ernie rolled up a wizard, Tenser. During the evening, the children fought and destroyed the first monsters of the Greyhawk dungeon; Gygax recalled this as either being some giant centipedes or a nest of scorpions.Gygax: \\"The monsters first encountered, by son Ernie's and daughter Elise's characters, were a nest of scorpions in some rubble in the very first room of the dungeon they entered. The glint of coins was mentioned to lure the incautious hand into attack proximity, but Elise's PC used a dagger to poke around, and the scorpions were spotted. Eventually one managed to sting, but the poison saving throw was made.\\" During the same session, Ernie and Elise also found the first treasure, a chest of 3,000 copper coins (which was too heavy to carry, much to the children's disappointment). After his children had gone to bed, Gygax immediately began to work on the second level of the dungeon. The next night, Don Kaye and Rob and Terry Kuntz joined in, rolling up the character Murlynd, Robilar and Terik respectively. In the following weeks and months, Tenser often adventured with Robilar and Terik. At one point, using their combined forces of loyal henchmen, the three controlled access to the first level of the Greyhawk dungeons while they ransacked the lower levels.Kuntz: \\"Robilar, along with Teric and Tenser, formed a triumvirate and took over the first level of Castle Greyhawk for a while. They barracked their respective forces there and guarded ingress and egress, using the location as a base for further adventures deep within the sprawling castle complex. \\" Eventually Tenser became the second character to reach the 13th (and at the time, the bottom level) of the Greyhawk dungeons, when he noticed that Robilar was missing and went in search of him. Gary Gygax \\"borrowed\\" Tenser's name for two spells, Tenser's floating disc and Tenser's transformation. When Gygax was forced out of TSR in 1985, he lost the rights to most of his characters, except those that were anagrams of his own name. Tenser is one of the famous mages whose spells were included in the 1988 Greyhawk Adventures hardbound. Tenser was reintroduced as a member of a repurposed Circle of Eight in 1989 in The City of Greyhawk boxed set, where he appeared as part of a cabal of nine wizards, including himself, who sought to balance the forces of Good and Evil in the world. When TSR decided to reboot the World of Greyhawk campaign setting in 1991, the storyline of the setting moved forward a decade to 585 CY, the year after the end of a continental war called the Greyhawk Wars. In events described in the new storyline, Rary and Tenser's old adventuring partner Robilar has attempted to destroy the Circle of Eight, and succeeded in murdering Tenser and Otiluke. This was the end of Tenser until TSR was bought by Wizards of the Coast and the Greyhawk storyline was once again revised. This time, in Roger E. Moore's D&D; adventure Return of the Eight (1998) the players meet the surviving members of the Circle of Eight (now called the \\"Circle of Five\\" because it was missing Tenser, Otiluke and Rary). If the players successfully finish the adventure, Tenser is rescued from death (although he refuses to rejoin the Circle). Description Tenser is medium-sized, with brown hair and an aquiline nose. He is always dressed in blue. He is polite and outgoing, but is willing to enforce his will on others for the sake of Law and Good. Relationships Tenser is a close friend of Jallarzi Sallavarian and Cymria. Agath of Thrunch often meets him at his fortress. Home Tenser makes his home in the Fortress of Unknown Depths on the southern shore of the Nyr Dyv, near the village of Magepoint, only a few days ride from the Free City of Greyhawk. History Tenser was born 525 CY, purportedly in the Wild Coast town of Fax. At some point after 551 CY, he was recruited by Mordenkainen and Bigby to join the Citadel of Eight. After the death of his good friend and fellow Citadel member Serten in 569 CY, the Citadel dissolved. Tenser joined forces with Bigby and Mordenkainen once more in 574 CY when he joined the Circle of Eight, replacing Leomund. In 570 CY, Tenser accompanied Bigby and Neb Retnar beneath Greyhawk Castle in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Robilar, Riggby, and Quij from freeing the demigod Iuz. In 579 CY, Robilar sacked the Temple of Elemental Evil, freeing the demoness Zuggtmoy in the process. In retribution, Tenser, Otis, Rufus, and Burne led an army of good- aligned forces in pursuit of his former companion, following him back to his castle and laying siege to it, defeating his armies and driving them from the Domain of Greyhawk to the Pomarj. In 581 CY, Tenser accompanied Bigby, Drawmij, Jallarzi Sallavarian, Nystul, Otiluke, Otto, and Rary to the tomb of Halmadar the Cruel. Every member of the party died that day, though they were brought back to life later through the agency of clone spells. The Circle was betrayed in 584 CY, when Tenser, Bigby, and Otiluke discovered a plan by the Circle's own Rary to slay a number of diplomats assembled in Greyhawk to sign the treaty ending the Greyhawk Wars. Unfortunately, Rary witnessed their discovery, and a great magical battle ensued, resulting in the deaths of Otiluke and Tenser, and severely wounding Bigby, who was unable to pursue Rary as he escaped. Word later came that Rary's allies, among them former Citadel member Lord Robilar, had ensured Tenser's and Otiluke's deaths by destroying every clone they had prepared for such an incident. Rary and Robilar fled to the Bright Desert, southeast of Greyhawk, where they established the Empire of the Bright Lands. However, Rary and Robilar had failed to discover a clone Tenser had hidden away on Celene, one of Oerth's moons, and in Goodmonth of 585 CY Tenser was restored to life. Though he was welcomed back into the Circle, Tenser refused. Spells Two of Tenser's eponymous spells, Tenser's Floating Disc and Tenser's Transformation, appear in the 3.5 Edition Player's Handbook. Other spells that he developed, described in such second edition supplements as Greyhawk Adventures, include: * Tenser's Brawl * Tenser's Deadly Strike * Tenser's Destructive Resonance * Tenser's Eye of the Eagle * Tenser's Eye of the Tiger * Tenser's Flaming Blade * Tenser's Floating Disc, Greater * Tenser's Fortunes of War * Tenser's Giant Strength * Tenser's Hunting Hawk * Tenser's Master of Arms * Tenser's Primal Fury * Tenser's Running Warrior * Tenser's Staff of Smiting * Tenser's Steady Aim Writings Tenser is known to have authored the following works: *Evolution of the Arcane Will Power *Magical Properties of Gemstones *Magical Properties of Herbs and Flowers *Occult Properties of Gemstones *Theory of the Invisible Forces  References   Further reading  * Blume, Brian, David Cook, and Jean Wells.

It constructs burrows into the banks of ponds and slow-moving streams, but prefers small, overgrown ponds with abundance of insects, crayfish and amphibians. The Russian desman often lives in small (usually not related) groups of two to five animals, and appears to have a complex (but largely unstudied) communication and social system.  Taxonomy  Russian desman The Russian desman is one of two surviving species of the tribe Desmanini, the other being the Pyrenean desman. Despite its outward similarity to muskrats (a rodent), the Russian desman is actually part of the mole family Talpidae in the order Eulipotyphla. Like other moles, it is functionally blind and obtains much of its sensory input from the touch-sensitive Eimer's organs at the end of its long, bilobed snout. However, the hind feet are webbed and the tail is laterally flattened ‚Äîspecializations for its aquatic habitat. The body is long while the tail is in length. Easily the largest species of mole, it weighs . Decidedly rich and thick in nature, desman fur used to be highly sought after by the fur trade. Consequently, the Russian desman is now a protected species under Russian law. However, due to loss of habitat (farming), water pollution, illegal fishing nets, and the introduction of non- native species like muskrat, population levels continue to decline. In the mid-1970s, an estimated 70,000 desmans were left in the wild; by 2004, the figure was only 35,000. However, in some Russian regions, the number of desmans appears to be increasing.  Distribution and habitat  From 2009 to 2011, the Don Basin rivers were searched for Russian desman to evaluate if this environment was sustainable for the species. No evidence was found that the species lives in this area but if so, the population was very small. The limiting factors consist of global factors, interspecific processes, and new immigrating species in the river ecosystem.

Byrd began a long association with the University of Maryland as an undergraduate in 1905, and eventually rose to the position of university president from 1936 to 1954. In the interim, he had also served as the university's athletic director and head coach for the football and baseball teams. Byrd amassed a 119‚Äì82‚Äì15 record in football from 1911 to 1934 and 88‚Äì73‚Äì4 record in baseball from 1913 to 1923. In graduate school at Georgetown University, he became one of football's early users of the newly legalized forward pass, and he had a brief baseball career including one season as pitcher for the San Francisco Seals. Byrd resigned as university president in order to enter politics in 1954. He ran an unsuccessful campaign as the Democratic candidate for Maryland Governor against Theodore McKeldin. Byrd later received appointments to state offices with responsibilities in the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. In the 1960s, he made unsuccessful bids for seats in each chamber of the United States Congress. Byrd was a proponent of a \\"separate but equal\\" status of racial segregation in his roles as both university administrator and political candidate. In 2015, the Student Government Association agreed to a resolution in support of changing the name of Byrd Stadium because Byrd was, in their words, \\"a racist and a segregationist\\" who \\"barred blacks from participating in sports and enrolling into the University until 1951\\". On September 28, 2015, University of Maryland President Wallace Loh appointed a task force to develop viewpoints and options. The University President then made a recommendation to the University System of Maryland Board of Regents ‚Äî the governing body of Maryland state universities ‚Äî to change the name to \\"Maryland Stadium\\". The ultimate decision on any name change rests with the Board of Regents.http://wtop.com/education/2015/09/working-group-considering-name- change-for-byrd-stadium/ On December 11, 2015, the Board of Regents voted 12-5 to remove the \\"Byrd\\" from the stadium's name, renaming it Maryland Stadium for the time being. Early life Harry Clifton Byrd was born on February 12, 1889, in Crisfield, Maryland. He was one of six children of oysterman and county commissioner William Franklin Byrd and his wife Sallie May Byrd. In his youth, Byrd worked in the Chesapeake Bay fishing industry, where he saved most of his money to finance his college education.Jason Rhodes, Somerset County, Maryland: A Brief History, pp. 111‚Äìa112, The History Press, 2007, . He attended Crisfield High School, where he excelled on the baseball diamond, and was also known as his hometown's first recreational jogger. A later source described how he appeared in 1905 > He was tall, and as the saying goes, built like a whip. He had a startlingly > handsome face, with big, flashing eyes, a splotch of florid red on each > cheek, and a mane of black curly hair ... He looked like Rupert of Hentzau, > and had all of that worthy's cold, sinister resolution about everything that > he did.James Mallahan Cain, 60 Years of Journalism, p. 120, Popular Press, > 1985, . College career Byrd as a senior at Maryland in 1908 In 1905, Byrd graduated from Crisfield High School and enrolled at the Maryland Agricultural College, which is now known as the University of Maryland. Byrd was a star college athlete and participated in varsity football, baseball, and track. He served as the football team captain in 1907, as the pitcher on the baseball team, and set a school record 10.0-second 100-yard dash in track. Before leaving Crisfield, Byrd's father warned him not to \\"try to play that thing called football.\\"Morris Allison Bealle, Kings of American Football: The University of Maryland, 1890‚Äì1952, p. 50, Columbia Publishing Co., 1952. He ignored the advice and reported for football practice where head coach Fred K. Nielsen told the undersized Byrd to \\"play with the kids\\" and that \\"football's a man's game.\\"Bealle, p. 49. He was allowed, however, to fill in as an end on the scout team due to a shortage of players. After sitting out the first three games, Nielsen sent Byrd in as a substitute against Navy, and his play was impressive enough to earn a position on the first team. After the elder Byrd read of his son's newfound stardom in the newspaper, he wrote, \\"Since you're going to play football, I'm glad to see you're doing it well.\\"Bealle, pp. 50‚Äì53. During the summers and on weekends, Byrd supplemented his income by continuing work as a fisherman. He graduated second in his class with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering in 1908.Harry Clifton Byrd papers, University of Maryland Libraries, retrieved July 4, 2010. After graduation from Maryland, Byrd spent the next three years doing graduate work in law and journalism at George Washington University, Georgetown University, and Western Maryland College (now known as McDaniel College). In a time before eligibility limitations, he played football at George Washington and Georgetown and ran track at Western Maryland. At Georgetown in 1909, he was called the first quarterback in the East to master the forward pass, several years before Gus Dorais of Notre Dame did so in 1913.Ted Patterson and Edwin H. Remsberg, Football in Baltimore: History and Memorabilia, p. 41, JHU Press, 2000, .Georgetown Football Timeline , Hoya Saxa, retrieved March 21, 2009. According to The Georgetown Hoyas: A Story of A Rambunctious Football Team, Dorais's \\"end-over-end 'discus' throw was an exact copy\\" of Byrd's passing technique, and the Irish \\"got the headlines because they had a press agent and Georgetown didn't.\\"Morris Allison Bealle, The Georgetown Hoyas: A Story of A Rambunctious Football Team, p. 75, Columbia Pub. Co., 1947. Byrd also played for Maryland-based semi-professional baseball teams while pursuing his graduate studies. In 1910, the Chicago White Sox signed Byrd, but he was soon traded to the San Francisco Seals, a semi-professional Pacific Coast League baseball team with whom he pitched in 1912. He returned to Maryland later that year, and in 1913, married Katherine Dunlop Turnbull. Before they divorced twenty years later, the couple had three sons and a daughter: Harry, Sterling, William, and Evelyn. Coaching career Coach Byrd on the gridiron in 1918 In 1911, injuries claimed enough Maryland Agricultural football players that the team could no longer field a practice squad to scrimmage against. The college turned to Byrd, who was serving as coach at Western High School in Georgetown, and he was willing to help his alma mater with scrimmages. Byrd later replaced head coach Charley Donnelly, who resigned mid-season after accumulating a 2‚Äì4‚Äì2 record.1911 , College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved October 9, 2011. Byrd led the Aggies to wins in both of their final games of the season, against Western Maryland, 6‚Äì0, and Gallaudet, 6‚Äì2.David Ungrady, Tales from the Maryland Terrapins, pp. 18‚Äì20, Sports Publishing LLC, 2003, . In 1913, the Maryland Agricultural College hired Byrd as an instructor in English and history, and he was named the head coach of the track and baseball teams, the latter of which he coached through 1923.2009 Maryland Baseball Media Guide, p. 25, University of Maryland, 2009. According to author David Ungrady in Tales from the Maryland Terrapins, the university initially offered Byrd $300 to coach football, but he demanded $1,200. The two parties came to agree upon that salary for all of his coaching and teaching duties which spanned nine months of the year. Byrd also worked as a sportswriter for The Washington Star, a job he held until 1932. As football coach, he developed a unique offensive scheme called the \\"Byrd system\\", which combined elements of the single-wing and double-wing formations.Old Liners Need New Backfield This Season, The Evening Independent, August 30, 1935. One of Byrd's track and football players, Geary Eppley, said, \\"He never yelled in practice or at a game ... He pointed out mistakes and explained what you did wrong. He took a calm approach. The strongest thing he'd say was 'for cripes sake.'\\" In 1915, his duties were expanded to include those of athletic director. That same year, he requested funds for the construction of the campus's first dedicated football stadium, which was named in his honor.Ungrady, p. 24. During his tenure as head football coach from 1911 to 1934, he compiled a 119‚Äì82‚Äì15 record.All-Time Coach Records by Year: Curley Byrd , College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved July 4, 2010. Administrative career The University of Maryland campus as it appeared in 1938 before the dramatic expansion engineered by President Byrd Byrd was appointed to the post of assistant university president in 1918. He became a proponent of unification of the Maryland Agricultural College and the Baltimore professional schools into a single public University of Maryland, and he was instrumental in what became the Consolidation Act of 1920. Byrd named the student newspaper The Diamondback in 1921, and in 1933, he was the lead advocate for the adoption of the diamondback terrapin as the university's official nickname and mascot. In 1932, Byrd was promoted to vice president of the university. In July 1935, he was named the acting president of the university, and was officially appointed to the presidency in February 1936. During his tenure, the budget, facilities, faculty, and enrollment increased significantly. The school budget was increased and the campus expanded largely due to Byrd's deft political maneuvering in Annapolis and Washington. The school also saw a large growth in enrollment, due in part to returning veterans making use of the G.I. Bill after World War II.David Scott Brown, Richard Hofstadter: an Intellectual Biography, p. 37, University of Chicago Press, 2006, .C. Fraser Smith, Lenny, Lefty, And The Chancellor: The Len Bias Tragedy And The Search For Reform In Big-Time College Basketball, p. 27, Bancroft Press, 1992, . From 1945 to 1948, the university budget increased from $4.8 million to $9.8 million. Between 1935 and 1954, student enrollment grew from 3,400 to 16,000. Over that same time period, the value of the campus rose from $5 million to $65 million. Byrd, however stood fast on faculty salaries. He reportedly said, \\"Ph.D.s are a dime a dozen.\\"Roger J. Brugger, Maryland, A Middle Temperament: 1634‚Äì1980, p. 565, JHU Press, 1996, . For years, Byrd refused to release the university's financial records to state legislators,C. Fraser Smith, William Donald Schaefer: a Political Biography, p. 125, JHU Press, 1999, . and how exactly he secured funding for many of his projects was largely a mystery.McMullen, p. 11. According to booster Jack Heise, Byrd financed a new basketball arena through the out-of-state tuition, paid by the federal government, for Maryland high school graduates who attended the university on the G.I. Bill. The General Accounting Office calculated that the extra fees totaled more than $2 million, but determined that they were within the bounds of legality.McMullen, p. 12. Byrd was a staunch supporter of a \\"separate but equal\\" state university system. The Princess Anne campus provided agricultural education and Morgan State College provided liberal arts education for the state's black students, while the University of Maryland remained open only to white students. In 1951, Governor Theodore McKeldin criticized the University of Maryland as an example of wasteful state spending, and was especially critical of expansions to the Princess Anne campus, which was geographically disconnected from the state's black population and not attracting many students to study agriculture. Contractors had begun projects at the college before approval from the public works board, which was described as a usual practice under Byrd. Byrd acceded to McKeldin and secured approval from the board for both the Princess Anne expansions as well as a sizable increase to the university budget.Theodore F. Scheckels, Maryland Politics and Political Communication, 1950‚Äì2005, pp. 150‚Äì151, Lexington Books, 2006, . In 1945, Byrd hired 32-year- old Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant to his first head coaching post. Bryant led the Terrapins to a 6‚Äì2‚Äì1 record, but the two personalities clashed.Football's Supercoach, Time, September 29, 1980. The tensions came to a head when Byrd reinstated a player Bryant had suspended for violating team rules.Al Browning, I Remember Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant: Personal Memoires of College Football's Most Legendary Coach, as Told by the People Who Knew Him Best, pp. 100-101, Cumberland House Publishing, . Bryant resigned as head coach an hour later, which caused an uproar among students until he interceded to restore order.Browning, p. 205. Two years later, Byrd hired Jim Tatum as football coach. The year prior at Oklahoma, Tatum fielded a winning team, but the athletic department ran up a huge deficit and some players were paid in violation of conference rules,Gary King, The Forgotten Man of Oklahoma Football: Jim Tatum; \\"Jim Tatum was a con-man, a dictator, a tyrant and one hell of a football coach.\\" ‚Äì Buddy Burris, All-American 1946, 1947 and 1948 , Sooner Magazine, University of Oklahoma Foundation, Inc., Spring 2008. which resulted in university president George Cross firing athletic director Jap Haskell. The media blamed Tatum for his termination.Gary King, An Autumn Remembered: Bud Wilkinson's legendary '56 Sooners, p. 38‚Äì40, University of Oklahoma Press, 2006, . Tatum told Cross to refute Tatum's role in the matter, and threatened to reveal the Oklahoma team had been paid $6,000 after the 1947 Gator Bowl. Cross asked Byrd to persuade Tatum not to go public, and according to author Gary King in An Autumn Remembered, Byrd replied, \\"Persuade, hell! I'll tell him to keep his damn mouth shut!\\" Tatum remained as coach at Maryland from 1947 to 1955, and amassed a 73‚Äì15‚Äì4 record. In 1948, the National Collegiate Athletic Association passed a set of regulations called the Purity Code, later renamed the Sanity Code, which permitted student- athletes free tuition and meals, but required that part-time jobs be legitimate and their pay commensurate with the work.Sport: What Price Football?, Time, January 23, 1950. Schools found to be in violation could be expelled from the NCAA. In 1950, seven schools, called the \\"Sinful Seven\\"-- Virginia, Maryland, VMI, Virginia Tech, The Citadel, Boston College, and Villanova--admitted they were in violation of the code. Time magazine asserted violators were far more widespread than those seven that had confessed. Maryland was the only Sinful Seven school that was also a major football power with eighty scholarship players, and Byrd led them in their stand against the Sanity Code.John Sayle Watterson, College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy, p. 214, JHU Press, 2002, . University of Virginia president Colgate Darden called the code hypocritical, and The Citadel's leadership refused to \\"lie to stay in the association\\" and requested termination of its NCAA membership. At the convention to decide Virginia's fate, Byrd said, \\"Does Ohio State want to vote for expulsion of Virginia, when Ohio State has facilities to take care of four or five as many athletes as Virginia?\\"Watterson, p. 217. The ensuing vote fell 25 short of the needed two- thirds majority to expel the Sinful Seven. In 1951, the football team's 10‚Äì0 season culminated in a 28‚Äì13 victory over first-ranked Tennessee in the 1952 Sugar Bowl. Maryland's participation, however, was in violation of a Southern Conference resolution passed mid-season that banned participation in postseason bowl games. Byrd had Maryland accept the bowl invitation, despite Tatum's objections. The coach thought the threatened sanctions, which prevented Maryland from playing any Southern Conference games the following season, would severely disadvantage his team.Ungrady, pp. 77‚Äì78. In 1952, Maryland and Clemson, which had also violated the bowl game ban, were sanctioned, and the incident hastened the break-up of the Southern Conference and formation of the Atlantic Coast Conference, of which both schools were founding members.K. Adam Powell, Border Wars: The First Fifty Years of Atlantic Coast Conference Football, p. xvi, Scarecrow Press, 2004, . Opponents in The Baltimore Sun alleged that Byrd emphasized athletics over academics and belittled him as the only college football coach to rise to the position of university president.Paul McMullen, Maryland Basketball: Tales from Cole Field House, pp. 10‚Äì12, JHU Press, 2002, . Among the campus expansions, Byrd was responsible for the construction of Byrd Stadium in 1950 and Cole Field House in 1955, which at the time was the largest basketball arena in the Southern Conference. Critics alleged that both facilities were constructed at the expense of campus libraries.The Coach, Time, August 3, 1959. Byrd also built the University of Maryland Golf Course in 1959. Byrd resigned from the post in 1953 and his tenure ended effectively on December 31.BYRD LEAVES U. OF M. POST DECEMBER 31; Retiring President Will Get Emeritus Rank, Full Pay For '54, The Baltimore Sun, September 25, 1953. Political career Byrd resigned from the presidency in January 1954 to embark upon an unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Maryland. He narrowly beat perennial candidate George P. Mahoney in the Democratic primary by 50.64% to 49.37% and faced Republican incumbent McKeldin in the general election. Byrd campaigned on his stance of separate but equal. McKeldin won comfortable majorities in Baltimore's black, Jewish, and upper-middle class white districts, while Byrd took all of the blue-collar white South and East Baltimore neighborhoods, including McKeldin's boyhood home along Eutaw Street.Kenneth D. Durr, Behind the Backlash: White Working- Class Politics in Baltimore, 1940‚Äì1980, UNC Press, 2003, . Elsewhere in the state, however, middle-class white voters did not support Byrd. Byrd lost by 54.46% to 45.54%. He went on to make unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nominations to the U.S. Senate in 1964 and the U.S. Congress in 1966. Despite his lack of success in campaigning, Byrd did receive several gubernatorial appointments: Chairman of the Maryland Tidewater Fisheries Commission, Maryland Commissioner to the Potomac River Fisheries Commission, and Chairman of the Commission on Chesapeake Bay Affairs. In 1959, Governor J. Millard Tawes appointed Byrd as commissioner of tidewater fisheries. When a fisheries officer killed a Virginian waterman illegally dredging, Byrd disarmed the force. The action was credited with helping to end the long-standing Potomac River Oyster Wars.Christine Keiner, The Oyster Question: Scientists, Watermen, and the Maryland Chesapeake Bay since 1880, pp. 174‚Äì175, University of Georgia Press, 2009, . Following the example of other oyster-producing states, Byrd authorized fossil shell mining to produce culch, crushed shells used to form oyster beds. Byrd ignored Tawes' warning to \\"stay away from private planting\\" by promoting the formation of leasing cooperatives, but his plan failed due to opposition in the Maryland General Assembly. Business career Byrd was also active in business and civic organizations. In 1951, he was involved in the merger that formed the Suburban Trust Company, which in 1960 was the largest bank in Maryland outside of Baltimore City.Suburban Trust Building , Peerless Rockville, retrieved July 4, 2010. He later served as the company's vice president. Byrd also did business in real estate and construction. Byrd was active with service organizations. In 1962, he became a member of the Loyal Order of the Moose. Byrd organized the College Park Rotary Club and served as its first president. Byrd was a member of the Defense Orientation Conference Association (DOCA), an organization which educates civilians on the Defense Department's programs and policies.Background and History , Defense Orientation Conference Association, retrieved July 4, 2010.

It is similar to sauerkraut, with the difference that it is prepared through the lacto-fermentation for several weeks of whole heads of cabbage, not separate leaves or grated mass. No vinegar or boiling is required. It is a homemade food preserve, commonly prepared in large barrels filled with whole cabbage heads and water salted with sea salt. Preparation After the external leaves and core have been removed, the cabbage heads are salted, packed into the barrel as densely as possible (another reason why round form is required) and covered with salted water (4‚Äì6% of salt). A heavy load (a rock, for example) is placed above, to keep them under the water, in anaerobic conditions. From time to time the water has to be reversed (flushed from the bottom of the barrel and than again sluiced onto the top), adding somewhat (but, always with salt) if necessary. A higher salinity makes the fermentation slower, while an insufficient salinity makes it unsafe. Higher temperatures require a higher salinity. The fermentation should be done at 16-22 ¬∞C. The best temperature is 18-20 ¬∞C. A cabbage fermented at a lower temperature has a better fragrance. The best known microorganisms involved in the process include Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacterium brevis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pediococcus cerevisiae and Lactobacterium plantarum.

Life and career William Ruthven was born in 1541 in Ruthven Castle, Perthshire, Scotland, the son of Patrick Ruthven, 3rd Lord Ruthven. On 23 August 1581, he was named Earl of Gowrie by James VI of Scotland.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1385082/Ruthven-family He and his father had both been involved in the murder of David Rizzio in 1566; and both took an active part on the side of the Kirk in the constant intrigues and factions among the Scottish nobility of the period. William had been the custodian of Mary, Queen of Scots, during her imprisonment in Loch Leven Castle, where, according to the queen, he had pestered her with amorous attentions. In 1582 Ruthven devised and undertook the Raid of Ruthven‚Äîa plot to seize the fifteen-year-old James VI during the king's visit to his home at Huntingtower Castle. Ruthven remained at the head of the government for several months during the detention. Ruthven continued to plot against the king, and was the last-known custodian of the silver casket that contained the Casket Letters; letters said to have been written by Mary, Queen of Scots, implicating her in the murder of her husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley.Bowes Correspondence(Surtees Society, 1842), pp. 236‚Äì7, Robert Bowes to Francis Cunningham, 8 November 1582. In May 1584 Ruthven was detained, tried, and beheaded at Stirling Castle because of his leading involvement in the Raid of Ruthven and all of his honors were forfeited. Following his execution, his lands were divided among the king's favourites, but the honours were restored to his son James in 1586. His widow, Dorothea Stewart came to the opening of Parliament on 22 August 1584 and kneeled on the Royal Mile crying to the king for grace for her children.

It is also considered the precursor of the Ionian University. It had Philological, Law and Medical Schools. The first period of existence of its Medical School was from 1824‚Äì1828. The second from 1844‚Äì1865 (when the Ionian islands united with Greece). Many of the physicians at the Academy had followed the traditional path of studying in Italy, and in particular at the medical School of Bologna.Jean Lascaratos, Spyros Marketos, \\"The Link between Medical School of Bologna and Ionian Academy\\".

In particular, George Therianos (Prof of General and Comparative Anatomy and Experimental Physics) from the island of Zante (Zakynthos) met the Earl of Guilford in 1825 in England and was given the position of professor of the Academy's Medical School. Giovanni Carandino (Ioannis Karantinos), who had already learnt mathematics with Charles Dupin at the original Ionian Academy established by the French during their occupation of the Septinsular Republic (1807‚Äì1824), was sent by Lord Guilford to study at the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris, France, in Italy and in England between 1820 and 1823, and became the director of the school of Mathematics at the Academy. The Academy gave Public courses in Sciences, Ethics and humanities, it offered subjects like, Physiology, Botany, political economy and Penal and Civil law. George Bowen was president of the Academy 1847-1851 and later first governor of Queensland. After the union of the Ionian Islands to the Kingdom of Greece in 1864, the Ionian Academy was closed to support the newly established University of Athens.

Aims and Purpose The OICCU vision is: Giving every student in Oxford University the chance to hear and respond to the Gospel of Jesus Christ https://www.oiccu.org The three aims of OICCU are: * Presenting the claims of Jesus Christ to the University * Uniting in fellowship those who desire to witness for Christ, and to deepen their spiritual life * Promoting involvement in God's work worldwide =Relationship to the local church= * The local church is a biblical principle which OICCU does not try to replace in the Christian's life: OICCU encourages all its members to also be part of a local church and to contribute to that family of believers. * OICCU has the opportunity as a student run organisation to put on events uniquely geared to what its members think its fellow-students want. * OICCU also has the opportunity to be prominent in the college communities in a way that churches cannot do. * OICCU is inter-denominational, so its declaration of belief reflects what its members believe to be central to the gospel, and not secondary issues which Christians differ on. =Activities and organisation= * Personal Evangelism is key to what OICCU does - its members want to get alongside non-Christians and tell them about Christ. * College Groups enable OICCU to put on events geared towards evangelising the individual college communities.https://www.oiccu.org/get-involved There is a college Christian Union group in almost every undergraduate college in the University. https://www.oiccu.org/find-your-college Text-a-toastie is a popular college outreach event. The collegiate structure also enables students to have fellowship with a small group of believers, which helps in reaching out to the rest of the college. OICCU believes that when non-Christians see the Christian Union's members acting like a family and supporting one another it helps with evangelism. * Central meetings mean that members of OICCU can be encouraged by seeing that there are lots of people who also want to witness for Christ in Oxford. OICCU has speakers, music and opportunities to hear about God's work in Oxford and further abroad. * Monday Morning Prayer: The members of OICCU pray together regularly,https://www.oiccu.org/get-involved recognising their belief that everything they do is useless if God is not at work. Central events are a resource to back up personal evangelism; OICCU has weekly events like 'Friday Lunchtime Talks' and bigger events like the Carol Services. * Events Week: Since 1940, OICCU has held weeks of evangelistic events including apologetics talks and a summary of the gospel. This now happens annually, with a larger series of evangelistic events organised every three years. * Residentials: OICCU hosts several annual residentials for its members, in particular the \\"Freshaway\\" event, which was first held in September 2016, and aims to help new students (\\"freshers\\") make Christian friends in the university, alongside seminars and talks to train and equip Christians for evangelism. https://www.uccf.org.uk/news/oiccu- freshaway-2016.htm * The Search is an event which aims to provide opportunities for open discussion between Christians and non-Christians on a variety of topics, and to allow Christians to share their beliefs with their friends. This event usually takes place in a local Oxford caf√©. http://oxfordstudent.com/2017/05/06/exploring-christianity-cornmarket- agnostic-insight-christian-union/ Beliefs and Affiliation OICCU adopts the doctrinal basis of UCCF (Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship), an evangelical Christian organisation with which OICCU is affiliated. https://www.uccf.org.uk/find-your-cu/central/oxford-uni-inter-collegiate.htm The doctrinal basis contains what evangelicals perceive as the biblical foundations of Christianity. UCCF is in turn affiliated with the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES). History =Foundation= OICCU was modelled after the Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union (CICCU), founded two years earlier, but later incorporated a Daily Prayer Meeting established in Brasenose College in 1867. Like Wycliffe Hall (also 1877), it could be seen as a response to the University's abandonment of its previous officially Protestant position. The initial members included Frank Chavasse, subsequently Bishop of Liverpool and founder of St Peter's College. =Relations with the SCM= OICCU was a founder member of the Student Christian Movement and followed its lead in liberalizing its doctrine. In 1914 OICCU, along with the rest of the University, suspended its activities. After World War I, the Oxford SCM was reestablished under that name, but those who held OICCU's original doctrinal position established a separate Oxford University Bible Union. In 1925 the two agreed to merge, and the OUBU became the Devotional Union of the Student Christian Movement in Oxford. However, the merger was not successful and in Michaelmas 1927, the Devotional Union committee voted to secede. The SCM gave them permission to use the old (1879) name and so OICCU was born anew, adopting the Doctrinal Basis of the new Inter-Varsity Fellowship of Evangelical Unions (now UCCF) in 1928. During much of this period, OICCU used some of the buildings later incorporated into St Peter's College. However, after 1933 it had the use of the Northgate Hall (just opposite the Oxford Union on St Michael's Street). =The Oxford Groups= During the 1920s and 1930s, an American preacher named Frank N. D. Buchman drew a considerable following at Oxford. He emphasized the use of small groups (with Buchman-appointed leaders) where sins were publicly confessed and repented of. The movement taught that the Holy Spirit was to directly guide Christians. These small groups became known as Oxford Groups and later Moral Re-Armament. The emphasis on small groups and personal belief was inherited by Alcoholics Anonymous. Buchman was appealing directly to the OICCU constituency, and Julian Thornton-Duesbury (one of OICCU's supervising university teachers) became a noted Buchmanite. However, OICCU's student leadership distanced themselves from Buchman. =1940s: Problems and Packer= The International Fellowship of Evangelical Students, the worldwide body to which OICCU belongs, was planned at a conference in Oxford in the late 1930s. World War II forced those plans to be delayed. The greatly reduced number of students in Oxford obviously interfered with OICCU itself; one medical student had to serve as President for much more than the customary one year of office. However, the Union maintained daily prayer meetings (in termtime) throughout the War. Afterwards, a Standing Committee of prominent past members was established to ensure the Union's long-term continuity in such circumstances and in 1948 they became trustees of the Northgate Hall. The Standing Committee also has some reserve powers regarding the Doctrinal Basis, although they have never been used. More positively, the prominent evangelical theologian J. I. Packer was converted to evangelical Christianity at an OICCU meeting in the 1940s, during his first week at the university. While a student member he was not regarded as doctrinally sound enough to join the Executive Committee. However, he was appointed Librarian, taking a particular interest in OICCU's selection of out-of-print Puritan books. In the following decade Packer, along with Martyn Lloyd-Jones, led a revival of Puritan studies amongst British pastors. He returned to Oxford in 2004 as the guest of honour at the 125th Anniversary celebrations. =Post-war era= The 1950s saw OICCU at perhaps its greatest numerical strength, while the SCM was seen to have moved towards Marxism. One leading figure at this time was Michael Green (President in 1952), who has been a leading evangelical in the Church of England and then the Anglican Communion since the 1960s. Green has taken a particular interest in promoting the Charismatic Movement, including within OICCU. In a slightly later generation, Tom Wright was the OICCU President (1970‚Äì71) and published his first book together with other members of his year's Executive Committee. The book was a plea for a conservative Calvinist doctrinal position, a position he has since modified. A feature of the post-war years has been the custom of triennial missions which attempt to explain the gospel to every undergraduate. These missions can trace their history back to the visit of Dwight Moody and Ira D. Sankey in 1882, but the current model began with a 1940 mission led by Lloyd-Jones. Subsequent main speakers have included Michael Green, Dick Lucas (long-time rector of St Helen's Bishopsgate), John Stott; one of Stott's series of talks was subsequently published as Basic Christianity, and Tim Keller. OICCU membership has diminished since the middle part of the century, and now usually stands in the low hundreds ‚Äî however formal membership is not needed to participate, and as of March 2006 OICCU's group membership on Facebook exceeded its official membership. The lease on the Northgate Hall was given up in the 1980s, and the Union has returned to the peripatetic existence of its earliest years, meeting in various church and public buildings around the city. Its archives are now held in the Bodleian Library and it has the use of a small store room at St Ebbe's church and New Road Baptist Church.

Struvite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system as white to yellowish or brownish-white pyramidal crystals or in platey mica-like forms. It is a soft mineral with Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2 and has a low specific gravity of 1.7. It is sparingly soluble in neutral and alkaline conditions, but readily soluble in acid. Struvite urinary stones and crystals form readily in the urine of animals and humans that are infected with ammonia-producing organisms. They are potentiated by alkaline urine and high magnesium excretion (high magnesium/plant-based diets). They also are potentiated by a specific urinary protein in domestic cats. Name Struvite was first described in 1845 by the German chemist (1811‚Äì1883), who found crystals of struvite in what he surmised had once been a medieval midden in Hamburg, Germany; he named the new mineral after the geographer and geologist (1772‚Äì1851) of Hamburg. Occurrence Struvite is occasionally found in canned seafood, where its appearance is that of small glass slivers, objectionable to consumers for aesthetic reasons but of no health consequence. A simple test can differentiate struvite from glass. Use of struvite as an agricultural fertilizer was in fact first described in 1857. =Struvite kidney stones= Struvite precipitates in alkaline urine, forming kidney stones. Struvite is the most common mineral found in urinary tract stones in dogs, and is found also in urinary tract stones of cats and humans. Struvite stones are potentiated by bacterial infection that hydrolyzes urea to ammonium and raises urine pH to neutral or alkaline values. Urea-splitting organisms include Proteus, Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Mycoplasma. Even in the absence of infection, accumulation of struvite crystals in the urinary bladder is a problem frequently seen in housecats, with symptoms including difficulty urinating (which may be mistaken for constipation) or blood in the urine (hematuria). The protein cauxin, a protein excreted in large amounts in cat urine that acts to produce a feline pheromone, has recently been found to cause nucleation of struvite crystals in a model system containing the ions necessary to form struvite. This may explain some of the excess struvite production in domestic cats. In the past, surgery has been required to remove struvite uroliths in cats; today, special acidifying low magnesium diets may be used to dissolve sterile struvite stones. Upper urinary tract stones that involve the renal pelvis and extend into at least 2 calyces are classified as staghorn calculi. Although all types of urinary stones can potentially form staghorn calculi, approximately 75% are composed of a struvite-carbonate-apatite matrix. File:Struvite stones.JPGDog struvite bladder stones File:Struvite crystals (urine) - Str√ºvit kristalleri (idrar) - 01.pngStruvite crystals in a human urine sample with a pH of 9. Abundant amorphous phosphate crystals, several squamous and non-squamous epithelial cells and a few leukocytes can also be observed. File:Struvite crystals (urine) - Str√ºvit kristalleri (idrar) - 02.pngAnother image from the same urine sample as with the image on the left. =Struvite enteroliths= Struvite is a common mineral found in enteroliths (intestinal concretions) in horses. =Wastewater treatment= Struvite can be a problem in sewage and waste water treatment, particularly after anaerobic digesters release ammonium and phosphate from waste material. Struvite can form a scale on lines and belts, in centrifuges and pumps, clog system pipes and other equipment including the anaerobic digester itself. Struvite, also referred to as MAP, forms when there is a mole to mole to mole ratio (1:1:1) of magnesium, ammonia and phosphate in the wastewater. The magnesium can be found in soil, seawater as well as drinking water. Ammonia is broken down from the urea in wastewater, and phosphate, which is found through food, soaps and detergents. These elements in place, struvite is more likely to form in a high pH environment, where there is higher conductivity, lower temperatures, and higher concentrations of magnesium, ammonia and phosphate. Recovery of phosphorus from wastestreams as struvite and recycling those nutrients into agriculture as fertilizer appears promising, particularly in agricultural manure and municipal waste water treatment plants. Having struvite scale in a wastewater treatment system can lead to great inefficiency within the plant or operation due to clogging of the pipes, pumps and equipment. There have been a few options to solve this issue, including replacing the pipes, or using a hydro- jetter or a mechanical grinder to clear them. But many lines can be underground and either of these options implies considerable downtime and labor. Chemical cleaning is now predominately used to clear systems of struvite. Chemical cleaning products have been developed to remove and prevent struvite with minimal downtime. Even a chemical-free, electric method of removing and preventing struvite has been developed and tested successfully at wastewater treatment plants in the USA. The electronic sine wave it produces is sent through the water in the pipe and is therefore effective on underground piping as well. Uses There is considerable interest in the utility of urine-derived struvite as a fertilizer in austere situations.

Two of its headwaters tributaries, the Middle Branch Blue Earth River and the West Branch Blue Earth River, also flow for short distances in northern Iowa. By volume, it is the Minnesota River's largest tributary, accounting for 46% of the Minnesota's flow at the rivers' confluence in Mankato. Via the Minnesota River, the Blue Earth River is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 3,486 square miles (9,029 km¬≤) in an agricultural region. Ninety percent of the river's watershed is in Minnesota. It is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources designated Water Trail. History The river was named for former deposits of bluish-green clay, no longer visible, along the banks of the river. The stream was called Makato Osa Watapa by the Dakota Indians, meaning \\"the river where blue earth is gathered.\\" The French explorer Pierre- Charles Le Sueur established Fort L'Huillier near the river's mouth in 1700 for the purpose of mining the clay, either in the mistaken belief that the clay contained copper, or as a ruse to secure funding from his patrons for his fur trading activities. The fort was abandoned the following year after an attack by the Fox tribe. In the 19th century, the geographer Joseph Nicollet found cavities from which the clay had been dug by Native Americans in the region, who used it as body paint; he found no evidence of Le Sueur's mines, nor of the fort. Geography The Blue Earth River begins at the confluence of its west and middle branches, approximately five miles (8 km) north of Elmore in southwestern Faribault County, Minnesota. The Middle Branch, longU.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed October 5, 2012 and sometimes known as the main stem of the river, rises in northwestern Winnebago County, Iowa, approximately east of Rake, and flows westwardly into Kossuth County, Iowa, then northwardly into Faribault County. The West Branch, long, rises near Swea City, Iowa, in northern Kossuth County and flows northeastwardly into Faribault County. Both headwaters tributaries have been channelized for much of their courses. From their confluence the Blue Earth River flows northwardly in a winding course through eastern Faribault County into Blue Earth County, past the cities of Blue Earth, Winnebago, and Vernon Center, to Mankato, where it enters the Minnesota River from the south. Rapidan Dam, constructed for the purpose of hydroelectricity generation in 1910, impounds the river upstream from its mouth; its reservoir filled with silt and mud soon after the dam's completion. The hydroelectric facility was later decommissioned but reactivated in 1984. The Blue Earth River's largest tributaries are the Le Sueur River, which it collects upstream of its mouth; and the Watonwan River, which it collects upstream of its mouth. The two rivers drain 31% and 24% of the Blue Earth's watershed, respectively. Tributaries of the river in its upper course include the East Branch Blue Earth River, long, which rises in southwestern Freeborn County and flows westwardly through Faribault County to the city of Blue Earth; and Elm Creek, long, which rises in northeastern Jackson County and flows eastwardly through Martin County into northeastern Faribault County, where it joins the Blue Earth River near Winnebago. The Blue Earth River flows in most of its course through till plains and the plain of a former glacial lake. The drain of the glacial lake, Union Slough, drains in two directions, south into the East Fork of the Des Moines River and north, as Union Slough, into the West Branch of the Blue Earth River. The lower (northern) part of the river's watershed was historically covered by the Big Woods, a tract of hardwoods that has since been largely converted to agricultural use; segments of the woodland extended southward along the riparian corridors of the Blue Earth River and its tributaries. In its lower course below Rapidan Dam, the river flows through a wooded gorge in the valley of the Minnesota River; this section is a popular canoeing route. According to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, approximately 84% of the Blue Earth River's watershed is used for agricultural cultivation, primarily that of corn and soybeans. The river is one of the most polluted in Minnesota, with elevated levels of sediment, bacteria, nitrates, phosphorus, mercury, PCBs, and pesticides, contributed in part by runoff in the watershed. Fecal coliforms, contributed by manure fertilizers, livestock waste, substandard septic tanks and outdated sewer systems, are often present in the river at levels considered by the state government to be unsafe for swimming. Flow rate The Blue Earth River near the USGS stream gauge in 2007 The United States Geological Survey operates a stream gauge on the Blue Earth River below Rapidan Dam in Rapidan Township, downstream of the mouth of the Watonwan River and upstream of the mouth of the Le Sueur River, and 12 miles (19 km) upstream from the river's mouth. The annual mean flow of the river at the gauge between 1909 and 2005 was 1,076 cubic feet per second (30 m¬≥/s). The highest recorded flow during the period was 43,100 ft¬≥/s (1,220 m¬≥/s) on April 9, 1965. The lowest recorded flow was 6.9 ft¬≥/s (0.2 m¬≥/s) on October 12, 1955.

Map of Clifton Skyline Chili parlor on the corner of Clifton and Ludlow Aves. Clifton is a neighborhood in the north central part of Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.Generally, when Cincinnatians refer to Clifton, they often incorrectly include its surrounding neighborhoods. The population was 8,304 at the 2010 census. The area includes the Ludlow Avenue Shopping and Dining District. Clifton is situated around Clifton Avenue, north of Dixmyth Avenue, approximately three miles north of Downtown Cincinnati. Several historic buildings and homes remain in the neighborhood. Clifton was developed in large part due to the expansion of the street car system in the 1880s-1890s. History Clifton was incorporated as a village in 1850. The village took its name from the Clifton farm, which contained of hills and dales. In the nineteenth century, mansions set in extensive grounds of gardens, parkland and woodlands dominated the northern section of Clifton, farther from the city. Their gates and gatehouses were spaced at intervals along Lafayette Avenue. In the southern section, denser settlement flanked a growing business district along Ludlow Avenue, centered on its juncture with Clifton Avenue. Many of the estate grounds were designed by the landscape designer Adolph Strauch, who served as the Superintendent of Spring Grove Cemetery and Arboretum in the 1850s, who later revised plantings when estates became public parkland, such as Eden Park and the of Burnet Woods, the former property of Jacob Burnet. The estates have found new uses in the twentieth century, or have been demolished, like Alexander McDonald's baronial mansion designed by Samuel Hannaford, the pre-eminent estate architect in later nineteenth-century Cincinnati; it was demolished in the 1960s to make way for an annex to the Clifton School: only a 150-year-old yew (Taxus cuspidata capitata) on the grounds of Fairview-Clifton German Language School(pdf file) and the carriage house remain.Clifton Cultural Arts Center The city of Cincinnati annexed Clifton in 1893. The University of Cincinnati relocated to Burnet Woods Park. Today the University is located in Clifton Heights, University Heights, Avondale, and Corryville, neighborhoods that surround Clifton. This entire area is often generically (and incorrectly) referred to as \\"Clifton\\" despite being several distinct and separate neighborhoods. Hebrew Union College, which settled near the University, and the Sacred Heart Academy in Clifton helped to contribute to the intellectual and bohemian atmosphere of the neighborhood. Culture The Ludlow Avenue business district has been designated Cincinnati's first \\"Main Street neighborhood\\" in a program sponsored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation; the Gaslight District contains many independent shops, restaurants and a movie theater specializing in independent and foreign films. Side streets are lit using original gas lamps, hence the name \\"Gaslight District.\\" There is a great diversity of retail outlets and dining and drinking establishments situated along Ludlow and intersecting streets. Businesses include the historic rock concert hall the Ludlow Garage where the Allman Brothers recorded their famous album ‚ÄúLive at the Ludlow Garage,‚Äù and Ludlow Wines, the oldest wine shop in Cincinnati. Clifton is situated on the hill overlooking Northside, Cincinnati. The historic Ludlow Avenue district was included in a 2010 episode of \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\", in which Sarah Jessica Parker traced her ancestry on the maternal side of her family. Speaking on camera that she is revisiting her old neighborhood of Clifton, Parker was filmed walking down Ludlow Avenue on a wintery day and entered the Clifton branch of the Cincinnati Public Library on Ludlow. Inside the library's small reading room, she and a local historian discussed the ancestry of the maternal side of her family.

Ayatollah Khomeini, the first leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, popularized the term. He opposed the chant for radio and television, but not for protests and other occasions.Arash Karami: Khomeini Orders Media to End ‚ÄòDeath to America‚Äô Chant , Iran Pulse, October 13, 2013 The literal meaning of the Persian phrase \\"Marg bar ƒÄmrikƒÅ\\" is \\"Death to America\\". In most official Iranian translations, the phrase is translated into English as the less crude \\"Down with America\\". The chant \\"Death to America\\" has come to be employed by various anti-American groups and protesters worldwide.Herbst, p. 6-7 A similar slogan \\"Death to Israel\\" (Persian: ŸÖÿ±⁄Ø ÿ®ÿ± ÿßÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ¶€åŸÑ) is also used, and regularly chanted in Iranian political rallies. Iranian officials generally explain that the slogan in its historical context has been provoked by U.S. government's hostile policies towards Iran and expresses outrage at those policies, and does not wish for literal death for American people themselves. In a speech to university students, Iran's Supreme Leader, Khamenei, interpreted the slogan as \\"death to the U.S.'s policies, death to arrogance\\". Following a meeting with Army and Air Force commanders, Khamenei declared that the Iranian people are not against American people, but that \\"Death to America\\" means down with American leaders, in this case President Trump, John Bolton, and Pompeo. Overview A conference named \\"Long Live Death to America\\" held on November 3, 2015 at Tehran University explores historical reasons for chanting the slogan. Following the fall of the pro-American Pahlavi dynasty in early 1979, Iranian protesters regularly shouted \\"Death to America\\" and \\"Death to the Shah\\" outside the U.S. embassy in Tehran, including the day the embassy was seized on November 4, 1979, which commenced the Iran hostage crisis. Throughout the crisis, Iranians surrounding the embassy chanted \\"Death to America\\" and \\"Death to Carter.\\" When Iran released the remaining 52 American hostages on January 20, 1981, they were led through a gauntlet of students forming parallel lines that shouted \\"Death to America\\" as they boarded the airplane that would fly them out of Tehran.Bowden, p. 584 \\"Death to the Soviet Union\\" and \\"Death to England\\" also became popular. The best known variation was \\"Death to Israel\\". Throughout the existence of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the slogan has formed a pillar of its revolutionary values. It is regularly chanted at Friday prayers and other public events, which is often accompanied by a burning of the flag of the United States. These events include the November 4 anniversary of the U.S. embassy seizure, which Iranian leaders declared in 1987 as a national holiday, called \\"Death to America Day.\\" State-sponsored murals that feature the slogan \\"Death to America\\" are common in Iranian cities, particularly Tehran. However, according to Hashemi Rafsanjani, Khomeini agreed in principle to drop the usage of the slogan in 1984. Rafsanjani's statement was rejected by his hard line opponents who said that \\"The Imam throughout his life called America 'the Great Satan'. He believed that all the Muslims' problems were caused by America.\\"Khomeini 'sought to drop Death to America chant', Guardian, Robert Tait, 20 August 2007 According to Politico magazine, following the September 11 attacks, Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, \\"suspended the usual 'Death to America' chants at Friday prayers\\" temporarily.34 Years of Getting to No with Iran.

On March 21, 2015, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei backed and shouted the phrase 'Death to America' while addressing a public gathering in Iran, during the holiday of Nowruz, the Persian New Year. In a statement published on his website on November 3, 2015, Khamenei said: \\"It goes without saying that the slogan does not mean death to the American nation; this slogan means death to the U.S.'s policies, death to arrogance.\\" On June 23, 2017, during Quds Day, protestors chanted \\"Death to America\\" and \\"Death to Israel\\". On April 25, 2018, Iran announced that a \\"Death to America\\" emoji would be included in a domestically produced messaging app. On May 9, 2018, an American flag was burned in the Iranian Parliament amidst chants of 'Death to America' after President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran.Iran lawmakers shout 'death to America,' burn U.S. flag after Trump nixes nuclear deal usatoday.com On November 4, 2018, Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the religious group Nation of Islam, led a \\"Death to America\\" chant during a solidarity trip to Iran, ahead of sanctions expected to be imposed by the Trump administration.Renowned antisemite louis farrakhan chants death to america on solidarity trip to Iran algemeiner.com Many anti-Iranian government protesters, both within Iran and abroad, used similar phrases to demonstrate against the theocratic government, especially during 2019 Iranian protests.

The slogan is simply against the interference of those governments [i.e. US, and Israel]\\". Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has also dismissed the literal interpretation of the slogan, stating that the slogan is to express opposition to US intrusive policies rather than hatred against American people. Law professor David Luban sees the slogan as a literal call for attacks on America such as the September 11 attacks.Luban, David. \\"The war on terrorism and the end of human rights.\\" Philosophy & Public Policy Quarterly 22.3 (2002): 9-14.

She went to school in Tsarskoye Selo but, after watching Eleonora Duse, joined the Moscow Art Theatre's studio. There she met the Russian-Jewish actor Mikhail Chekhov (Anton's nephew) in 1914 and married him the same year, taking his surname as her own. Their daughter, also named Olga, was born in 1916. She became an actress under the name of Ada Tschechowa. During the year of the 1917 October Revolution, Chekhova divorced her husband but kept his name. In the first year of the revolution, she joined a cabaret-theatre group called Sorokonozhka (The Little Centipede), as the troupe consisted of twenty members and only forty feet. Chekhova also was given a part in a silent movie, Anya Kraeva. The following year, in 1918, she was given roles in Cagliostro and in The Last Adventure of Ars√®ne Lupin. Although she was a part of the social circle around the Moscow Art Theatre, she never played a role there, despite her later claims to having her first theatre role in The Cherry Orchard. She managed to get a travel passport from the Soviet government, possibly in exchange for her cooperation, which led to permission to leave Russia. She was accompanied by a Soviet agent on a train to Vienna, then she moved to Berlin in 1920. That same year, she married Frederick Yaroshi, though they divorced in 1921.http://survincity.com/2011/11/russian-prima-nazi-cinema/ Her first cinema role in Germany was in F. W. Murnau silent movie Schlo√ü Vogel√∂d (1921). She played in Max Reinhardt's productions at UFA. She made the successful transition from silent film to talkies. In the 1930s, she rose to become one of the brightest stars of the Third Reich and was admired by Adolf Hitler. She appeared in such films as The Hymn of Leuthen although she preferred comedies. In 1936 she married for the third time, to Marcel Robbins, which ended in divorce in 1938.https://www.geni.com/people/–ú–∞—Ä—Å–µ–ª—å- –†–æ–±–±–∏–Ω—Å/6000000039870515304  Joseph Goebbels  A published photograph of her sitting beside Hitler at a reception gave the leaders of the Soviet intelligence service the impression that she had close contacts with Hitler. She had more contact with the Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, who referred to her in his diaries as \\"eine charmante Frau\\" (\\"a charming lady\\"). She is also rumored to have been a communist spy in a Soviet conspiracy. According to the book Killing Hitler (2006) by the British author Roger Moorhouse, she was pressured by Stalin and Beria to flirt with Adolf Hitler in order to gain and transfer information so that Hitler could be killed by secret Soviet agents.  Later years  Olga achieved great success in the motion picture industry. Her filmography includes 138 credits as an actor, director, and producerhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874781/ between 1917 and 1974. After the war she lived in the Soviet sector of Berlin, but eventually she managed to escape from her Soviet contacts. In 1949, she moved to Munich, Bavaria, and launched a cosmetics company, Olga Tschechowa Kosmetik. At the same time she continued acting, and played supporting roles and cameos in more than 20 films. She largely retired from acting in the 70s, after publishing a book of memoirs. Her correspondence with Russian actresses Olga Knipper and Alla Tarasova was published posthumously. Her niece Marina Ried and granddaughter Vera Tschechowa also became actresses.

The foot of the sail can be stretched by a boom or held loose-footed just by its sheets. A spritsail has four corners: the throat, peak, clew, and tack. The Spritsail can also be used to describe a rig that uses a spritsail. Spritsails appeared in the 2nd century BC in the Aegean Sea on small Greek craft.Casson, Lionel (1995): \\"Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, , pp. 243‚Äì245 Here a spritsail used on a Roman merchant ship (3rd century AD). Historically, spritsails were the first European fore-and-aft rigs, appearing in Greco-Roman navigation in the 2nd century BC. The rig The luff of the sail is bound to the mast, but unlike the gaff rig where the head is bound to a spar, this rig supports the leech of the sail by means of a diagonal spar or spars named a sprit ( ). The forward end of the sprit spar is attached to the mast, with the after end of the sprit spar attached to the peak. The sprit is steadied and controlled from the deck by a pair of wire vangs ( ) attached to the peak of the sail. It is said to be the ancestor of the common gaff rig that evolved in 16th-century Holland. The foot of the sail may be bent to a boom, or be loose- footed and just controlled by its sheets. Barges Mast case (tabernacle) on SB Centaur Muzzle on SB Centaur The spritsail was best known from its use in the Thames sailing barge, which employs two similarly sized spars to form the framework for the sail area. In a barge, the mast is stepped vertically in a mast case or tabernacle, whilst the sprit is suspended by chain stanliffs (standing lifts) from the hounds at the mast head at an angle of about 30¬∞ from vertical, with sprit to the starboard side of the mast. The heel of the sprit is secured to the mast, by the muzzle, which allows the sprit the freedom to move laterally, nearly as far to each side as the shrouds. This enables the vessel to reach and run. The instability caused by allowing such a weighty spar to extend too far away from the vessel's centreline, however, had to be borne in mind when designing hull and rigging. The peak of the sail is permanently attached to the head of the sprit, which is steadied by two sets of vangs. Thames sailing barges. The barge in the distance has all sail set, mainsail (the spritsail), topsail, foresail, topmast staysail and mizzen. The spritsail rig was normally used without a boom. (The latter was usually found on fore-and-aft rigged vessels to keep the mainsail in an aerodynamically efficient shape.) Such loose-footed sails can also be found on gaff-rigged Norfolk wherrys and the bawley class of vessel. The spritsail was a feature of the Cromster where the ability to furl the foot of the sail and raise the sheets, made gunnery much more readily possible. The sail could still be controlled using the vangs. In a commercial vessel, the rig has the advantage of allowing a high stack of deck cargo and freeing the cargo hatch of obstructions when loading and unloading. The entire sail can be quickly brailed to the mast. The overriding advantage is safety in open water. Barges are unballasted and, if overpressed, will heel excessively and must be pulled to wind. The sheet will be eased and the aft end of a boom could drag in the water making the rudder ineffective and a capsize inevitable. The sheet of loose footed boomless barge is just released and control is regained. The boom does not project outboard so that the vessel can pass through a narrow gap between moored vessels. Loose footed sails suffer from sail twist which reduces their aerodynamic efficiency when sailing off the wind, which usually is not a commercial issue. It can be an advantage in light air. The vangs control the head of the sail which can be set so as to make use of the air above the wind-shadow of moored ships, warehouses and so on. Mainsail fully brailed and stowed on SB Xylonite. The head of the diagonal sprit is steadied by the vangs. This fine control of the sail without need for the crew to leave the deck, is achieved by brailing up. Rather than lowering the mainsail, it is gathered up against its own luff and head by means of lines called brails. This technique is an effective way of stowing the mainsail and gives fine control over the power obtained from the sail. In narrow channels, and in the lee of tall buildings the mailsail and mizzen are brailed and the bowsprit topped up, and she sails on topsail and foresail alone. A gaff rig was far more suitable for heavy weather and long sea passages, but when a daff rigged boomie takes in the mainsail, she cannot set the topsail. However, it means that the sail is stowed aloft and unreachable from the deck. It also means that the sail cannot easily be covered when it is stowed, and thus protected from the elements. But in any case, the crews of working vessels did not trouble with such dainty ways. In keeping with the general philosophy of working boats, all sails would therefore be traditionally treated with red oxide and other substances. Foot of the forestay and windlasses on SB Pudge and SB Centaur The problem of the inaccessibility of gear was met in the Thames barge by stepping the mast in a tabernacle and using a windlass on the foredeck to strike the whole lot, mast, sprit, sails and rigging. The crew could sail under a low bridge such as at Aylesford or Rochester the without losing steerage way. The windlass is below the tack of the foresail and the tackle at the foot of the forestay. In striking the gear, the foresail tack tackle had to be cast off, the bridge cleared, the skipper and an extra man (the huffler) used the windlass to raise the mast. Dinghies Leisure sailing on an Optimist Modern use of the spritsail has also become more common through its use in the Optimist (dinghy) - this uses a boomed spritsail - in the case of which the sprit is tensioned by a snotter arrangement. This much simpler implementation sees the sprit anchored higher on the mast than on barges. =Leg of mutton spritsail= This is a sprit rig that uses a triangular sail, the luff is bent to the mast, and the one spar, the sprit- boom attaches to the clew of the sail. The fore end of the boom is tensioned (pulled tight to the mast) by use of a snotter chord. On a Bolger 59 rig, there is a 14'3\\" luff, 13'7\\" leech and 9'0\\" foot. Local boats Boat on Padma River, Bangladesh The spritsail is also commonly used in a fore-and-aft rig (along with a staysail) on local traditional wooden boats of the west coast of Norway, most notably the faering variant of the Oselvar.:no:Fil:Oselver.jpg Traditionally, up until the second half of the 1800s, these boats used to be rigged with a square rig.Google Translate Square rigged ships In an inconvenient piece of nautical ambiguity, the term \\"spritsail\\" also refers to a sail used aboard some square-rigged vessels, typically on vessels developed prior to the middle of the 19th century CE. Unrelated to the spritsail described above, it is an evolution of the ancient Greek artemon that was eventually made obsolete by the evolution of more efficient headsails. In the context of square-rigged vessels, the spritsail is a square sail set under the bowsprit; a \\"spritsail topsail\\" may be set above it, though this latter element of a square-rigged sailplan fell into disuse early in the 18th century CE.Anderson, R. C. (1927). \\"Peface\\". The Rigging of Ships in the Days of the Spritsail Topmast 1600-1720 (First, 1927 ed.). Portland, Maine: The Southworth Press. p. vii. In this form, in addition to carrying the spritsail itself the spritsail yard, mounted under the bowsprit abaft the dolphin striker, also often provided some lateral support for the jibboom and flying jibboom via the guys supporting those spars.

Louis Leipoldt, ( 28 December 1880 ‚Äì 12 April 1947) was a South African poet, dramatist, medical doctor, reporter and food expert. Together with Jan F. E. Celliers and J. D. du Toit, he was one of the leading figures in the poetry of the Second Afrikaans Movement. Apart from poetry, Leipoldt wrote novels, plays, stories, children's books, cookbooks and a travel diary. He is numbered amongst the greatest of the Afrikaner poets and he was described by D. J. Opperman, himself a noted South African poet, as \\"our most versatile artist\\". Biography Leipoldt c. 1925 Leipoldt was born in Worcester in the Cape Province, the son of a preacher, Christian Friedrich Leipoldt, of the NG Kerk in Clanwilliam and grandson of the Rhenish missionary, Johann Gottlieb Leipoldt, who founded Wupperthal in the Cederberg. His mother was Anna Meta Christiana Esselen, daughter of Louis Franz Esselen (1817‚Äì1893), another Rhenish missionary at Worcester. His early education was largely at home and for a while, during the Second Boer War, he was a reporter. Between 1902 and 1907, with funding from the botanist Harry Bolus, he read medicine at Guy's Hospital in London and travelled in Europe, America and the East Indies. At times his health was poor. For a period of some six months during 1908, he was the personal physician of the American newspaper magnate, Joseph Pulitzer, aboard Pulitzer's yacht. Later Leipoldt's career was varied. For a period he was a school doctor in London before becoming the Medical Inspector of Schools in the Transvaal and then in the Cape Province. He returned to journalism for a while (1923) but finally settled down as a paediatrician in Cape Town in 1925. He never married. He died in Cape Town but, because of his deep love for the Hantam‚Äî a mountainous and wild district north of Cape Town‚Äî his ashes were laid to rest in the rugged Pakhuis Pass (Storehouse Pass), near Clanwilliam. Faint Rock Art above the grave His grave is situated at the base of a cave- like opening on the mountain face. Directly above his tombstone there are faint drawings on the sandstone that were made by Bushmen many years before his death. Leipoldt had an adopted son, Jeffery Barnet Leipoldt. Jeffery died on 21 November 1997. His ashes were scattered on his father's grave. Jeffery had three daughters, Nerina, Karen and Desre, who live in Johannesburg, South Africa. Poetry The Worst Horror :This is the bitterest thing of all my days, ::That which I have loved so well, that now is dead ::And in a coffin laid away, of lead :And cedarwood, immortal somewhere stays, :Or as a ghost- cloud goes its lonely ways ::By strange and boundless forces urged ahead, ::Perhaps, like me, forlorn, uncomforted, :But out of reach, howe'er one pleads or prays, :Day after day with unending lament. ::This is the bitterest thing, that I no hand :::Can reach to help, or comfort to impart, :No aid can give, and no encouragement; ::And that there wanders in that ghostly land :::Forlorn, that which I loved with all my heart! (Translated by C. J. D Harvey) Leipoldt wrote much about nature in general and in particular about the landscapes and legends of his beloved Hantam. His poetry also deals with the suffering caused by the Second Boer War and the culture and values of the Cape Malays. Most of his work does not translate well into English. Dietetics Leipoldt authored the book Common-Sense Dietetics in 1911. In the book he argued against total abstainers from both alcohol and meat. Leipoldt heavily criticized vegetarianism. A review in the British Medical Journal commented that \\"We cannot help doubting whether all the author's opinions so dogmatically expressed are based upon an experience that can justify them, for many of his comments suggest that he is speaking rather from hearsay than from personal knowledge. Nevertheless, he has written a lively and entertaining book, which we have no doubt will find many admirers among those who wish to eat and drink well.\\" In 1936, Leipoldt updated his book under the title The Belly Book. A review of the book concluded that its chapter on diet and disease is \\"useless both to the doctor and to the layman, and abounds in statements for which there is no scientific justification.\\" Legacy The C. Louis Leipoldt Medical Centre in Cape Town is named after the poet, as is the Louis Leipoldt Primary School in Lyttelton (Centurion).

The Big Melt The Furnace Every hour, Magna holds a display called \\"The Big Melt\\". Its purpose is to demonstrate how steel was made in an electric arc furnace until the steelworks closed in 1993. A furnace is imitated with fog, spark, flame and smoke machines, loudspeakers, lights, and blasts of rapidly burning propane which are ignited at appropriate points in the show. The show can be repeated up to four times an hour, but, in practice, it is usually run once an hour or twice an hour if visitor numbers are very high.

At the height of their popularity, the band was touted as an American counterpart of The Rolling Stones. Particularly striking in their appearance was the sight of drummer, Victor \\"Moulty\\" Moulton's prosthetic hook used in place of his missing left hand to hold his left drumstick during performances. During their tenure, the Barbarians produced two nationally charting hits, including the novelty single, \\"Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl?\\". History The Barbarians were formed in the summer of 1964 in Provincetown, Massachusetts, by original members Victor \\"Moulty\\" Moulton, Bruce Benson, Ronnie Enos, and Jerry Causi. The band was quickly assembled by Moulton, who had agreed to do a gig at The Rumpus Room, an ex-jazz club where his cousin worked. After packing the house for their opening performance, they were asked to come back numerous times throughout the season. By the end of the summer, record companies had heard about them and they were taken to New York to start their careers. While their first single, \\"Hey Little Bird\\" produced by Al Ham (on Joy Records (New York)) was unsuccessful, two of their next three singles (on Laurie) charted on Billboard, (with \\"Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl?,\\" peaking at No. 55) and also made the Cash Box charts. \\"Are You a Boy\\" was co-written by Doug Morris, who went on to head Universal Music Group. They received their biggest break when featured on The T.A.M.I. Show (performing \\"Hey Little Bird\\") alongside other artists such as The Rolling Stones, The Supremes, Lesley Gore, Chuck Berry, James Brown & The Famous Flames, The Miracles, and Marvin Gaye. Their \\"pirates on the beach\\" look‚Äîleather sandals, open necked/bloused sleeved shirts (sometimes a vest as well), black jeans, longer-than-usual hair‚Äîwas distinctive, topped by the sight of drummer Moulton's hook-shaped prosthetic left hand, which he would use to hold his left drumstick during performances. Having lost the hand in an explosion when he was fourteen, Moulton had enabled his drumming by modifying the prosthesis to hold a drumstick. A later, minor hit, entitled \\"Moulty\\", was a humorous and melodramatic autobiographical song chronicling the drummer's life and the loss of his hand. Moulton sang lead on the track, but instead of the original members, he was backed by New York session musicians including members of Levon & the Hawks, later to be known as The Band. Although it barely scraped the Billboard charts, the song would gain a cult following when it was included on Lenny Kaye's Nuggets compilation in 1972. In 1965, Boston guitarist Geoffrey Morris replaced Ronnie Enos on lead guitar, providing the arrangement of \\"Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl?,\\" a song parodying the trend towards long hair popularized by British Invasion rock acts, such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, which was regarded at the time by parents as a bad influence on young males. The song would be released as a single in 1966. In 1967, Benson, Morris, and Causi left The Barbarians to form Black Pearl. One year later, having become a version of the group incorporating Denny Romans aka Demian Bell (from Maypole) as the lead guitarist and lead singer, and Walter Parks as Bass player, the Barbarians disbanded. They had evolved to combine martial arts and music by rigorously rehearsing nearly every day at a Karate dojo owned by Moulton's brother-in- law. The Ramones' song, \\"Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?,\\" which appears as the opening cut on their End of the Century album, includes \\"Moulty\\" (drummer Victor Moulton) in the litany of rock and roll figures and institutions name-dropped in its lyrics.

The station broadcasts at 100.7 MHz on the FM dial with an ERP of 50 kW and is licensed to Racine, Wisconsin. Its studios are located in the Milwaukee suburb of Greenfield and the transmitter site is in Raymond. The playlist of V-100.7 consists of primarily current hip-hop and R&B;, but airs slower R&B; and classic soul songs on its Quiet Storm program in the weekday late night hours. At 50,000 watts, WKKV's signal is one of the strongest in the area, and can travel over Lake Michigan into the state of Michigan. V-100.7 can be heard reliably as far west as Madison, Wisconsin, north to Sheboygan, Wisconsin, south into the Chicago suburbs, and beyond depending on conditions. Due to its tower lying in close proximity to the open waters of Lake Michigan, both its analog and digital signal can periodically travel with local quality in excess of 120 miles to the east along the Michigan shoreline without interference, this is most common in the summer months when warm air temperatures and the cool lake waters create favorable conditions for tropospheric propagation. WKKV is home to the annual \\"Jam 4 Peace\\" concert. History The original call letters were WRJN-FM, shared with its then-sister station. WRJN-FM began broadcasting August 26, 1948. It was licensed to Racine Broadcasting Corporation. In early 1969, the owner of another Racine station, WRAC, purchased WRJN-FM for $60,000.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC- IDX/69-OCR/BC-1969-03-17-Page-0058.pdf A few months later, the station became WRAC-FM.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC- IDX/69-OCR/BC-1969-07-21-Page-0062.pdf In December 1970, WRAC-FM flipped to a rock-based Top 40 format with the WRKR call sign, primarily targeting Racine, Kenosha and the southern part of Milwaukee County. They were known at various times as \\"The Rocker 100 FM\\", \\"Hot 100\\" and \\"Hitradio 100\\". WRKR gradually started targeting the whole Milwaukee market. At one time, WRKR was the Milwaukee-area affiliate of American Top 40 (which was also later carried by then-rival WKTI after it added the show in 1982). Due to heavy Top 40 competition, WRKR began adding light R&B; music around 1986, and for less than a year were called \\"Heartbeat 101\\" (WHBT-FM). WHBT-FM was the first \\"rhythmic adult contemporary\\" station in the country, 10 years before pioneer WAMG-FM flipped to the format. The WRKR call sign was reassigned by the FCC to a Kalamazoo, MI station about that time, where it remains today. In September 1987, the station became new-age music-formatted WBZN-FM (Breezin' 100.7).http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-09-04.pdf The station flipped to Urban contemporary on June 6, 1991, becoming WKKV-FM (V-100 FM).http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1991/RR-1991-06-07.pdfhttp://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-06-15.pdf After many years, the \\"Doug Banks Morning Show\\" ended in December 2007, and the station replaced him with Steve Harvey. After six years, Harvey was dropped in August 2013, and WKKV-FM became a charter affiliate of the New York-based Breakfast Club distributed in-house by iHeartRadio. HD Radio On April 25, 2006, Clear Channel announced that WKKV's HD2 subchannel will carry a format focusing on gospel music. In the summer of 2009, the \\"Hallelujah\\" format was replaced by \\"All My Jams,\\" an Adult Urban Contemporary format available through Clear Channel's iHeartRadio smartphone application. On December 15, 2011, Clear Channel began airing the progressive talk programming of WXXM (92.1) from Sun Prairie/Madison on WKKV's HD3 subchannel, giving the Milwaukee market its first station in the format, albeit with no programming originating locally from Milwaukee. After WXXM ended that format in November 2016, WKKV-HD2 began to serve as an FM HD repeater of sports station WOKY (920). It again switched on November 30, 2018 with a move to soft adult contemporary, branded as \\"The Breeze\\"; the move of WOKY's local sports programming to WRNW's analog FM/HD1 subchannel made it all but redundant.Upper Midwest Broadcasting References External links *V100.7 website * Category:African-American history of Wisconsin KKV Category:Urban contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1948 Category:1948 establishments in Wisconsin Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WKKV-FM"},{"id":"2507943","text":"The Sex Discrimination Act may refer to: *Sex Discrimination Act 1975, in the UK *Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002, in the UK *Sex Discrimination Act 1984, in Australia *The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 in the United Kingdom.

Famine had been a recurrent feature of life the Indian sub-continental countries of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, most notoriously during British rule. Famines in India resulted in more than 60 million deaths over the course of the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. Famines in British India were severe enough to have a substantial impact on the long-term population growth of the country in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Indian agriculture is heavily dependent on climate: a favorable southwest summer monsoon is critical in securing water for irrigating crops. Droughts, combined with policy failures, have periodically led to major Indian famines, including the Bengal famine of 1770, the Chalisa famine, the Doji bara famine, the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì1878, and the 1943 Bengal famine. Some commentators have identified British government inaction as a contributing factor to the severity of famines during the time India was under British rule. Famine largely ended by the start of 20th century with the 1943 Bengal famine being an exception related to complications during World War II. The 1883 Indian Famine Codes, transportation improvements and changes following independence have been identified as furthering famine relief. In India, traditionally, agricultural labourers and rural artisans have been the primary victims of famines. In the worst famines, cultivators have also been susceptible. Railroads built for the commercial goals of exporting food grains and other agricultural commodities only served to exacerbate economic conditions in times of famine. However by the 20th century, the extension of the railroad by the British helped put an end to the massive famines in times of peace. The last major famine was the Bengal famine of 1943. A famine occurred in the state of Bihar in December 1966 on a much smaller scale and in which \\"Happily, aid was at hand and there were relatively fewer deaths\\". The drought of Maharashtra in 1970‚Äì1973 is often cited as an example in which successful famine prevention processes were employed. In 2016‚Äì2018, 194 million of 810 million undernourished people globally lived in India, making the country a key focus for tackling hunger on a global scale. In the last two decades, per capita income more than tripled, yet the minimum dietary intake fell. Ancient, medieval and pre-colonial India Kalinga in 265 BCE ‚Äì Ashokan inscriptions record hundreds of thousands dying from famine and disease after the Kalinga War in 269 BCE. One of the earliest treatises on famine relief goes back more than 2000 years. This treatise is commonly attributed to Kautilya who was also known as Vishnugupta(Chanakya), who recommended that a good king should build new forts and water-works and share his provisions with the people, or entrust the country to another king. Historically, Indian rulers have employed several methods of famine relief. Some of these were direct, such as initiating free distribution of food grains and throwing open grain stores and kitchens to the people. Other measures were monetary policies such as remission of revenue, remission of taxes, increase of pay to soldiers, and payment of advances. Yet other measures included construction of public works, canals, and embankments, and sinking wells. Migration was encouraged. Kautilya advocated raiding the provisions of the rich in times of famine to \\"thin them by exacting excess revenue.\\" Information on famines from ancient India up to colonial times is found in five primary sources: # Legendary accounts passed down in oral tradition that keep alive the memory of famines # Ancient Indian sacred literature such as the Vedas, Jataka stories, and the Arthashastra # Stone and metal inscriptions provide information on several famines before the 16th century # Writings of Muslim historians in Mughal India # Writings of foreigners temporarily resident in India (e.g. Ibn Battuta, Francis Xavier) The ancient Ashokan edicts of the Mauryan age around 269 BCE record emperor Asoka's conquest of Kalinga, roughly the modern state of Odisha. The major rock and pillar edicts mention the massive human toll of about 100,000 due to the war. The edicts record that an even larger number later perished, presumably from wounds and famine. From Hindu literature, there is the 7th century famine due to failure of rains in Thanjavur district mentioned in the Periya Puranam. According to the Purana, Lord Shiva helped the Tamil saints Sambandar and Appar to provide relief from the famine. Another famine in the same district is recorded on an inscription with details such as \\"times becoming bad\\", a village being ruined, and cultivation of food being disrupted in Landing in 1054. Famines preserved only in oral tradition are the Dvadasavarsha Panjam (Twelve-year Famine) of south India and the Durga Devi Famine of the Deccan from 1396 to 1407. The primary sources for famines in this period are incomplete and locationally based The Tughlaq Dynasty under Muhammad bin Tughluq held power during the famine centered on Delhi in 1335‚Äì42. The sultanate offered no relief to the starving residents of Delhi during this famine. Pre-colonial famines in the Deccan included the Damajipant famine of 1460 and the famines starting in 1520 and 1629. The Damajipant famine is said to have caused ruin both in the northern and southern parts of the Deccan. The 1629-32 famine in the Deccan and Gujarat, was one of the greatest in India's history. In the first 10 months of 1631 an estimated 3 million perished in Gujarat and one million in the Deccan. Eventually the famine killed not only the poor but the rich as well. More famines hit the Deccan in 1655, 1682 and 1884. Another famine in 1702‚Äì1704 killed over two million people. The oldest famine in Deccan with local documentation sufficiently well-preserved for analytical study is the Doji bara famine of 1791-92. Relief was provided by the ruler, the Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao II, in the form of imposing restrictions on export of grain and importing rice in large quantities from Bengal via private trading, however the evidence is often too scanty to judge the 'real efficacy of relief efforts' in the Mughal period. According to Mushtaq A. Kaw, measures employed by the Mughal and Afghan rulers to fight famine in Kashmir were insufficient due to geographic obstacles and corruption in the Mughal administration. Mughal officials took no long term measures to fight famines in Kashmir, and the land tax system of Mughal India often contributed to the scale of famines by depriving Indian peasants of much of their harvest in the good years, denying them the opportunity to build up stocks. British rule People waiting for famine relief in Bangalore. From the Illustrated London News, (20 October 1877) The late 18th and 19th centuries saw increase in the incidence of severe famine. Millions died from 1850 to 1899 in 24 major famines; more than in any other 50-year period. These famines in British India were bad enough to have a remarkable impact on the long term population growth of the country, especially in the half century between 1871‚Äì1921. The first, the Bengal famine of 1770, is estimated to have taken the lives of nearly one-third of the population of the region‚Äîabout 10 million people., although recent estimates suggest the figure is closer to 2 million The impact of the famine caused East India Company revenues from Bengal to decline to ¬£174,300 in 1770‚Äì71. The stock price of the East India Company fell sharply as a result. The company was forced to obtain a loan of ¬£1 million from the Bank of England to fund the annual military budget of between ¬£60,000‚Äì1 million. Attempts were later made to show that net revenue was unaffected by the famine, but this was possible only because the collection had been \\"violently kept up to its former standard\\". The 1901 Famine Commission found that twelve famines and four \\"severe scarcities\\" took place between 1765 and 1858. Researcher Brian Murton states that the famines recorded after the arrival of the English, but before the establishment of the Indian Famine Codes of the 1880s, bear a cultural bias regarding the stated causes of the famine because they \\"reflect the view of a handful of Englishmen.\\" These sources, however, contain accurate recordings of weather and crop conditions. Florence Nightingale made efforts to educate British subjects about India's famines through a series of publications in the 1870s and beyond. Evidence suggests that there may have been large famines in south India every forty years in pre-colonial India, and that the frequency might have been higher after the 12th century. These famines still did not approach the incidence of famines of the 18th and 19th centuries under British rule. =Scholarly opinions= Florence Nightingale pointed out that the famines in British India were not caused by the lack of food in a particular geographical area. They were instead caused by inadequate transportation of food, which in turn was caused due to an absence of a political and social structure. Nightingale identified two types of famine: a grain famine and a \\"money famine\\". Money was drained from the peasant to the landlord, making it impossible for the peasant to procure food. Money which should have been made available to the producers of food via public works projects and jobs was instead diverted to other uses. Nightingale pointed out that money needed to combat famine was being diverted towards activities like paying for the British military effort in Afghanistan in 1878‚Äì80. Economy Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen found that the famines in the British era were not due to a lack of food but due to the inequalities in the distribution of food. He links the inequality to the undemocratic nature of the British Empire. Tirthankar Roy suggests that the famines were due to environmental factors and inherent in India's ecology. Roy argues that massive investments in agriculture were required to break India's stagnation, however these were not forthcoming owing to scarcity of water, poor quality of soil and livestock and a poorly developed input market which guaranteed that investments in agriculture were extremely risky. After 1947, India focused on institutional reforms to agriculture however even this failed to break the pattern of stagnation. It wasn't until the 1970s when there was massive public investment in agriculture that India became free of famine, although Roy is of the opinion that improvements in the market efficiency did contribute to the alleviation of weather-induced famines after 1900, an exception to which is the Bengal famine of 1943. Mike Davis regards the famines of the 1870s and 1890s as 'Late Victorian Holocausts' in which the effects of widespread weather induced crop failures were greatly aggravated by the negligent response of the British administration. This negative image of British rule is common in India.Davis argues that \\"Millions died, not outside the 'modern world system', but in the very process of being forcibly incorporated into its economic and political structures. They died in the golden age of Liberal Capitalism; indeed, many were murdered ... by the theological application of the sacred principles of Smith, Bentham and Mill.\\" However, since the British Raj was authoritarian and undemocratic, these famines only occurred under a system of economic liberalism, not social liberalism.http://www.histoire- politique.fr/documents/11/dossier/pdf/HP11_Mantena_pdf_200510.pdf Michelle Burge McAlpin has argued that economic changes in India during the 19th century contributed towards the end of famine. The overwhelmingly subsistence agriculture economy of 19th century India gave way to a more diversified economy in the 20th century, which, by offering other forms of employment, created less agricultural disruption (and, consequently, less mortality) during times of scarcity. The construction of Indian railways between 1860 and 1920, and the opportunities thereby offered for greater profit in other markets, allowed farmers to accumulate assets that could then be drawn upon during times of scarcity. By the early 20th century, many farmers in the Bombay presidency were growing a portion of their crop for export. The railways also brought in food, whenever expected scarcities began to drive up food prices. Similarly, Donald Attwood writes that by the end of the 19th century 'local food scarcities in any given district and season were increasingly smoothed out by the invisible hand of the market and that 'By 1920, large-scale institutions integrated this region into an industrial and globalising world‚Äîending famines and causing a rapid decline in mortality rates, hence a rise in human welfare'. =Causes= Victims of the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78 The famines were a product both of uneven rainfall and British economic and administrative policies. Colonial policies implicated include rack-renting, levies for war, free trade policies, the expansion of export agriculture, and neglect of agricultural investment. Indian exports of opium, rice, wheat, indigo, jute, and cotton were a key component of the economy of the British empire, generating vital foreign currency, primarily from China, and stabilising low prices in the British grain market. According to Mike Davis, export crops displaced millions of acres that could have been used for domestic subsistence, and increased the vulnerability of Indians to food crises. Others dispute that exports were a major cause of the famine, pointing out that trade did have a stabilising influence on India's food consumption, albeit a small oneMartin Ravallion, Trade and stabilisation: Another look at British India's controversial foodgrain exports, Explorations in Economic History, Volume 24, Issue 4, October 1987, Pages 354‚Äì370 The Odisha famine of 1866‚Äì67, which later spread through the Madras Presidency to Hyderabad and Mysore, was one such famine. The famine of 1866 was a severe and terrible event in the history of Odisha in which about a third of the population died. The famine left an estimated 1,553 orphans whose guardians were to receive an amount of 3 rupees per month until the age of 17 for boys and 16 for girls. Similar famines followed in the western Ganges region, Rajasthan, central India (1868‚Äì70), Bengal and eastern India (1873‚Äì1874), Deccan (1876‚Äì78), and again in the Ganges region, Madras, Hyderabad, Mysore, and Bombay (1876‚Äì1878). The famine of 1876‚Äì78, also known as the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78, caused a large migration of agricultural labourers and artisans from southern India to British tropical colonies, where they worked as indentured labourers on plantations. The large death toll‚Äîabout 10.3 million‚Äîoffset the usual population growth in the Bombay and Madras Presidencies between the first and second censuses of British India in 1871 and 1881 respectively. The large-scale loss of life due to the series of famines between 1860 and 1877 was the cause of political controversy and discussion which led to the formation of the Indian Famine Commission. This commission would later come up with a draft version of the Indian Famine Code. It was the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78, however, that was the direct cause of investigations and the beginning of a process that led to the establishment of the Indian Famine code. The next major famine was the Indian famine of 1896‚Äì97. Although this famine was preceded by a drought in the Madras Presidency, it was made more acute by the government's policy of laissez faire in the trade of grain. For example, two of the worst famine-afflicted areas in the Madras Presidency, the districts of Ganjam and Vizagapatam, continued to export grains throughout the famine. These famines were typically followed by various infectious diseases such as bubonic plague and influenza, which attacked and killed a population already weakened by starvation. =British response= A contemporary print of the Madras famine of 1877 showing the distribution of relief in Bellary, Madras Presidency. From the Illustrated London News, (1877) The first major famine that took place under British rule was the Bengal Famine of 1770. About a quarter to a third of the population of Bengal starved to death in about a ten-month period. East India Company's raising of taxes disastrously coincided with this famine and exacerbated it, even if the famine was not caused by the British colonial government. Following this famine, \\"Successive British governments were anxious not to add to the burden of taxation.\\" The rains failed again in Bengal and Odisha in 1866. Policies of laissez faire were employed, which resulted in partial alleviation of the famine in Bengal. However, the southwest Monsoon made the harbour in Odisha inaccessible. As a result, food could not be imported into Odisha as easily as Bengal. In 1865‚Äì66, severe drought struck Odisha and was met by British official inaction. The British Secretary of State for India, Lord Salisbury, did nothing for two months, by which time a million people had died. The lack of attention to the problem caused Salisbury to never feel free from blame. Some British citizens such as William Digby agitated for policy reforms and famine relief, but Lord Lytton, the governing British viceroy in India, opposed such changes in the belief that they would stimulate shirking by Indian workers. Reacting against calls for relief during the 1877‚Äì79 famine, Lytton replied, \\"Let the British public foot the bill for its 'cheap sentiment,' if it wished to save life at a cost that would bankrupt India,\\" substantively ordering \\"there is to be no interference of any kind on the part of Government with the object of reducing the price of food,\\" and instructing district officers to \\"discourage relief works in every possible way.... Mere distress is not a sufficient reason for opening a relief work.\\" Shashi Tharoor writes: The Lt.-Governor of Bengal, Sir Richard Temple, successfully intervened in the Bihar famine of 1874 with little to no mortality; this is the only known example of adequate measures meeting a food crisis by the British.Ertem, √ñzge. ‚ÄùBritish Views on the Indian and Ottoman Famines: Politics, Culture, and Morality,‚Äù In RCC Perspectives: The Imagination of Limits. Exploring Scarcity and Abundance, edited by F. Felcht and K. Ritson, 17-29. Munich, 2015. http://www.environmentandsociety.org/perspectives/2015/2/imagination-limits- exploring-scarcity-and-abundance. Temple was criticized by many British officials for spending too much on famine relief. Then in 1876 a huge famine broke out in Madras. Lord Lytton's administration believed that 'market forces alone would suffice to feed the starving Indians.' The results of such thinking proved fatal (some 5.5 million starved), so this policy was abandoned. Lord Lytton established the Famine Insurance Grant, a system in which, in times of financial surplus, INR 1,500,000 would be applied to famine relief works. The result was that the British prematurely assumed that the problem of famine had been solved forever. Future British viceroys became complacent, and this proved disastrous in 1896. About 4.5 million people were on famine relief at the peak of the famine. Curzon stated that such philanthropy would be criticised, but not doing so would be a crime. He also cut back rations that he characterised as \\"dangerously high,\\" and stiffened relief eligibility by reinstating the Temple tests. Between 1.25 and 10 million people died in the famine. The famine during World War II lead to the development of the Bengal Famine Mixture (based on rice with sugar). This would later save tens of thousands of lives at liberated concentration camps such as Belsen. =Policy influences= British famine policy in India was influenced by the arguments of Adam Smith, as seen by the non-interference of the government with the grain market even in times of famines. Keeping the famine relief as cheap as possible, with minimum cost to the colonial exchequer, was another important factor in determining famine policy. According to Brian Murton, a professor of geography at the University of Hawaii, another possible impact on British policy on famine in India was the influence of the English Poor Laws of 1834, with the difference being that the English were willing to \\"maintain\\" the poor in England in normal times, whereas Indians would receive subsistence only when entire populations were endangered. Similarities between the Irish famine of 1846‚Äì49 and the later Indian famines of the last part of the 19th century were seen. In both countries, there were no impediments to the export of food during times of famines. Lessons learnt from the Irish famine were not seen in the correspondence on policy-making during the 1870s in India. =Famine Codes= Victims of the Indian famine of 1896‚Äì97 in Jabalpur The Famine Commission of 1880 observed that each province in British India, including Burma, had a surplus of food grains, and that the annual surplus amounted to 5.16 million metric tons. The product of the Famine Commission was a series of government guidelines and regulations on how to respond to famines and food shortages called the Famine Code. These had to wait until the exit of Lord Lytton as viceroy, and were finally passed in 1883 under a subsequent more liberal- minded viceroy, Lord Ripon. They presented an early warning system to detect and respond to food shortages. Despite the codes, mortality from famine was highest in last 25 years of the 19th century. At that time, annual exports of rice and other grains from India was approximately one million metric tons. Development economist Jean Dr√®ze evaluated the conditions before and after Famine Commission policy changes: \\"A contrast between the earlier period of frequently recurring catastrophes, and the latter period when long stretches of tranquility were disturbed by a few large scale famines\\" in 1896‚Äì97, 1899‚Äì1900, and 1943‚Äì44. Dr√®ze explains these \\"intermittent failures\\" by four factors‚Äîfailure to declare a famine (particularly in 1943), the \\"excessively punitive character\\" of famine restrictions such as wages for public works, the \\"policy of strict non-interference with private trade,\\" and the natural severity of the food crises. There was a threat of famine, but after 1902 there was no major famine in India until the Bengal famine of 1943. This famine was the most devastating; between 2.5 and 3 million people died during World War II. In India as a whole, the food supply was rarely inadequate, even in times of droughts. The Famine Commission of 1880 identified that the loss of wages from lack of employment of agricultural labourers and artisans were the cause of famines. The Famine Code applied a strategy of generating employment for these sections of the population and relied on open-ended public works to do so. The Indian Famine Code was used in India until more lessons were learnt from the Bihar famine of 1966‚Äì67. The Famine Code has been updated in independent India and it has been renamed \\"Scarcity Manuals.\\" In some parts of the country, the Famine Code is no longer used, primarily because the rules embodied in them have become routine procedure in famine relief strategy. =Impact of rail transport= Railroad network on the eve of the worst famines in Indian history in 1870s The failure to provide food to the millions who were hungry during the famines of the 1870s has been blamed both on the absence of adequate rail infrastructure and the incorporation of grain into the world market through rail and telegraph. Davis notes that, \\"The newly constructed railroads, lauded as institutional safeguards against famine, were instead used by merchants to ship grain inventories from outlying drought-stricken districts to central depots for hoarding (as well as protection from rioters)\\" and that telegraphs served to coordinate a rise in prices so that \\"food prices soared out of the reach of outcaste labourers, displaced weavers, sharecroppers and poor peasants.\\" Members of the British administrative apparatus were also concerned that the larger market created by railway transport encouraged poor peasants to sell off their reserve stocks of grain. Rail transport, however, also played an essential role in supplying grain from food-surplus regions to famine-stricken ones. The 1880 Famine Codes urged a restructuring and massive expansion of railways, with an emphasis on intra-Indian lines as opposed to the existing port-centred system. These new lines extended the existing network to allow food to flow to famine-afflicted regions. Jean Dr√®ze (1991) also finds that the necessary economic conditions were present for a national market in food to reduce scarcity by the end of the 19th century, but that export of food continued to result from that market even during times of relative scarcity. The effectiveness of this system, however, relied on government provision of famine relief: \\"Railroads could perform the crucial task of moving grain from one part of India to another, but they could not assure that hungry people would have the money to buy that grain\\". A famine weakens body resistance and leads to increases in infectious diseases, especially cholera, dysentery, malaria, and smallpox. Human response to famine could spread the disease as people migrated in search of food and work.David Arnold, \\"Social Crisis and Epidemic Disease in the Famines of Nineteenth-Century India,\\" Social History of Medicine (December 1993) 6#3 pp 385‚Äì404 On the other hand, railways also had a separate impact on reducing famine mortality by taking people to areas where food was available, or even out of India. By generating broader areas of labour migration and facilitating the massive emigration of Indians during the late 19th century, they provided famine-afflicted people the option to leave for other parts of the country and the world. By the 1912‚Äì13 scarcity crisis, migration and relief supply were able to absorb the impact of a medium-scale shortage of food. Dr√®ze concludes, \\"In sum, and with a major reservation applying to international trade, it is plausible that the improvement in communication towards the end of the nineteenth century did make a major contribution to the alleviation of distress during famines. However, it is also easy to see that this factor alone could hardly account for the very sharp reduction in the incidence of famines in the twentieth century\\". =Bengal famine of 1943= Child who starved to death during the Bengal famine of 1943 The Bengal famine of 1943 reached its peak between July and November of that year, and the worst of the famine was over by early 1945. Famine fatality statistics were unreliable, and it is estimated up to two million died. Although one of the causes of the famine was the cutting off of the supply of rice to Bengal during the fall of Rangoon to the Japanese, this was only a fraction of the food needed for the region. According to the Irish economist and professor Cormac √ì Gr√°da, priority was given to military considerations, and the poor of Bengal were left unprovided for. Attempts were made by the Government of India to direct food from surplus regions such as Punjab to famine areas in Bengal but the provincial governments obstructed the movement of grain.Famine Inquiry Commission 1945a, pp. 198- 199. The Famine Commission of 1948 and economist Amartya Sen found that there was enough rice in Bengal to feed all of Bengal for most of 1943. Sen claimed the famine was caused by inflation, with those benefiting from inflation eating more and leaving less for the rest of the population. These studies, however, did not account for possible inaccuracies in estimates or the impact of fungal disease on the rice. De Waal states that the British government did not enforce the Famine Codes during the Bengal famine of 1943 because they failed to detect a food shortage. The Bengal famine of 1943 was the last catastrophic famine in India, and it holds a special place in the historiography of famine due to Sen's classic work of 1981 titled Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation. Republic of India Since the Bengal famine of 1943, there has been a declining number of famines which have had limited effects and have been of short durations. Sen attributes this trend of decline or disappearance of famines after independence to a democratic system of governance and a free press‚Äînot to increased food production. Later famine threats of 1984, 1988 and 1998 were successfully contained by the Indian government and there has been no major famine in India since 1943. Indian Independence in 1947 did not stop damage to crops nor lack of rain. As such, the threat of famines did not go away. India faced a number of threats of severe famines in 1967, 1973, 1979 and 1987 in Bihar, Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Gujarat respectively. However these did not materialise into famines due to government intervention. The loss of life did not meet the scale of the 1943 Bengal or earlier famines but continued to be a problem. Jean Dr√®ze finds that the post-Independence Indian government \\"largely remedied\\" the causes of the three major failures of 1880‚Äì1948 British famine policy, \\"an event which must count as marking the second great turning point in the history of famine relief in India over the past two centuries\\". =Infrastructure development= Deaths from starvation were reduced by improvements to famine relief mechanisms after the British left. In independent India, policy changes aimed to make people self-reliant to earn their livelihood and by providing food through the public distribution system at discounted rates. Between 1947 and 1964 the initial agricultural infrastructure was laid by the founding of organisations such as the Central Rice Institute in Cuttack, the Central Potato Research Institute in Shimla, and universities such as the Pant Nagar University. The population of India was growing at 3% per year, and food imports were required despite the improvements from the new infrastructure. At its peak, 10 million tonnes of food were imported from the United States. In the twenty-year period between 1965 and 1985 gaps in infrastructure were bridged by the establishment of The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). During times of famines, droughts and other natural calamities, NABARD provides loan rescheduling and loan conversion facilitates to eligible institutions such as State Cooperative banks and Regional Rural Banks for periods up to seven years. In the same period, high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice were introduced. Steps taken in this phase resulted in the Green Revolution which led to a mood of self-confidence in India's agricultural capability. The Green Revolution in India was initially hailed as a success, but has recently been 'downgraded' to a 'qualified success'‚Äînot because of a lack of increased food production, but because the increase in food production has slowed down and has not been able to keep pace with population growth. Between 1985 and 2000, emphasis was laid on production of pulses and oilseed, as well as vegetables, fruits, and milk. A wasteland development board was set up, and rain-fed areas were given more attention. Public investment in irrigation and infrastructure, however, declined. The period also saw a gradual collapse of the cooperative credit system. In 1998‚Äì99, NABARD introduced a credit scheme to allow banks to issue short-term and timely credit to farmers in need via the Kisan Credit Card scheme. The scheme has become popular among issuing bankers and the recipient farmers with a total credit of made available via the issuing of 23,200,000 credit cards . Between 2000 and , land use for food or fuel has become a competing issue due to a demand for ethanol. =Local beliefs= The rodent genera Rattus and Mus are a part of the mechanism that causes a decline in food availability in northeastern India Since the time of Mahabharata, people in several regions of India have associated spikes in rat populations and famine with bamboo flowering. The northeastern state of Mizoram has bamboo as a dominant species over much of the state which experiences a cyclical phenomenon of bamboo flowering followed by bamboo death. The bamboo plants are known to undergo gregarious flowering once in their life cycle which can happen anywhere in a range of 7 to 120 years. A common local belief and observation is that bamboo flowering is followed by an increase in rats, famine and unrest amongst the people. This is called mautam. The first such event in the Republic of India was reported in 1958 when the local Mizo District Council cautioned the Assam government of an impending famine which the government rejected on the grounds that it was not scientific. A famine did occur in the region in 1961. In 2001 the Government of India began working on an emergency plan to address regional food shortages after reports that bamboo flowering and bamboo death would occur again in the near future. According to Forest Department Special Secretary K.D.R. Jayakumar, the relationship between famine and bamboo flowering, while widely believed to be true by the tribal locals, has not been scientifically proven. John and Nadgauda, however, strongly feel that such a scientific connexion exists, and that it may not simply be local myth. They describe a detailed mechanism demonstrating the relationship between the flowering and the famine. According to them, the flowering is followed by a large quantity of bamboo seeds on the forest floor which causes a spike in the population of the rodent genera Rattus and Mus who feed of these seeds. With the changing weather and onset of rains, the seeds germinate and force the mice to migrate to land farms in search of food. On the land farms, the mice feed on crops and grains stored in granaries which causes a decline in food availability. In 2001, the local administration tried to prevent the impending famine by offering local villagers the equivalent of $2.50 for every 100 rats killed. The botanist H. Y. Mohan Ram of the University of Delhi, who is one of the country's foremost authorities on bamboo, considered these techniques outlandish. He suggested that a better way of solving the problem was to teach the local farmers to switch to cultivating different varieties of crops such as ginger and turmeric during periods of bamboo flowering since these crops are not consumed by the rats. Similar beliefs have been observed thousands of kilometres away in south India in the people of Cherthala in the Alappuzha district of Kerala who associate flowering bamboo with an impending explosion in the rat population. =Bihar drought= The Bihar drought of 1966‚Äì7 was a minor drought with relatively very few deaths from starvation as compared to earlier famines . The drought demonstrated the ability of the Indian government to deal with the worst of drought related circumstances. The official death toll from starvation in the Bihar drought was 2353, roughly half of which occurred in the state of Bihar. No significant increase in the number of infant deaths from famine was found in the Bihar drought. The annual production of food grains had dropped in Bihar from 7.5 million tonnes in 1965‚Äì66 to 7.2 million tonnes in 1966‚Äì1967 during the Bihar drought. There was an even sharper drop in 1966‚Äì67 to 4.3 million tonnes. The national grain production dropped from 89.4 million tonnes in 1964‚Äì65 to 72.3 in 1965‚Äì66 ‚Äî a 19% drop. Rise in prices of food grains caused migration and starvation, but the public distribution system, relief measures by the government, and voluntary organisations limited the impact. On a number of occasions, the Indian-government sought food and grain from the United States to provide replacement for damaged crops. The government also set up more than 20,000 fair-price stores to provide food at regulated prices for the poor or those with limited incomes. A large scale drought in Bihar was adverted due to this import, although livestock and crops were destroyed. Other reasons for successfully averting a large scale drought were the employing various drought prevention measures such as improving communication abilities, issuing drought bulletins over the radio and offering employment to those affected by drought in government public works projects. The Bihar drought of 1966‚Äì67 gave impetus to further changes in agricultural policy and this resulted in the Green Revolution. =1972 Maharashtra drought= A child suffering extreme starvation in India in 1972 After several years of good monsoons and a good crop in the early 1970s, India considered exporting food and being self-sufficient. Earlier in 1963, the government of the state of Maharashtra asserted that the agricultural situation in the state was constantly being watched and relief measures were taken as soon as any scarcity was detected. On the basis of this, and asserting that the word famine had now become obsolete in this context, the government passed \\"The Maharashtra Deletion of the Term 'Famine' Act, 1963\\". They were unable to foresee the drought in 1972 when 25 million people needed help. The relief measures undertaken by the Government of Maharashtra included employment, programmes aimed at creating productive assets such as tree plantation, conservation of soil, excavation of canals, and building artificial lentic water bodies. The public distribution system distributed food through fair- price shops. No deaths from starvation were reported. Large scale employment to the deprived sections of Maharashtrian society which attracted considerable amounts of food to Maharashtra. The implementation of the Scarcity Manuals in the Bihar and Maharashtra famines prevented the mortality arising from severe food shortages. While the relief programme in Bihar was poor, Dr√®ze calls the one in Maharashtra a model programme. The relief works initiated by the government helped employ over 5 million people at the height of the drought in Maharashtra leading to effective famine prevention. The effectiveness of the Maharashtra was also attributable to the direct pressure on the government of Maharashtra by the public who perceived that employment via the relief works programme was their right. The public protested by marching, picketing, and even rioting . Dr√®ze reports a labourer saying \\"they would let us die if they thought we would not make a noise about it.\\" The Maharashtra drought in which there were zero deaths and one which is known for the successful employment of famine prevention policies, unlike during British rule. =West Bengal drought= The drought of 1979‚Äì80 in West Bengal was the next major drought and caused a 17% decline in food production with a shortfall of 13.5 million tonnes of food grain. Stored food stocks were leveraged by the government, and there was no net import of food grains. The drought was relatively unknown outside of India. The lessons learnt from the Maharashtra and West Bengal droughts led to the Desert Development Programme and the Drought Prone Area Programme. The intent of these programmes was to reduce the negative effects of droughts by applying eco-friendly land use practices and conserving water. Major schemes in improving rural infrastructure, extending irrigation to additional areas, and diversifying agriculture were also launched. The lessons from the 1987 drought brought to light the need for employment generation, watershed planning, and ecologically integrated development. =2013 Maharashtra drought= In March 2013, according to Union Agriculture Ministry, over 11,801 villages in Maharashtra were declared drought affected. The drought was considered the second worst to date, exceeded only by the drought in Maharashtra in 1972. =Other issues= Deaths from malnutrition on a large scale have continued across India into modern times. In Maharashtra alone, for example, there were around 45,000 childhood deaths due to mild or severe malnutrition in 2009, according to the Times of India. Another Times of India report in 2010 has stated that 50% of childhood deaths in India are attributable to malnutrition. Growing export prices, the melting of the Himalayan glaciers due to global warming, changes in rainfall and temperatures are issues affecting India. If agricultural production does not remain above the population growth rate, there are indications that a return to the pre- independence famine days is a likelihood. People from various walks of life, such as social activist Vandana Shiva and researcher Dan Banik, agree that famines and the resulting large scale loss of life from starvation have been eliminated after Indian independence in 1947. However, Shiva warned in 2002 that famines are making a comeback and government inaction would mean they would reach the scale seen in the Horn of Africa in three or four years.

She was named after Admiral Robert Coontz, the US Navy's second chief of naval operations. Commissioned in 1960, she spent the early part of her career in the Pacific Ocean, participating in four tours of duty during the Vietnam War. In the early 1970s she transferred to the east coast and spent the remainder of her service years in the Caribbean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Persian Gulf. She assisted in saving after that ship was hit by Iraqi missiles. In 1975, as part of the Navy's reclassification process, all ships of her class were reclassified as guided missile destroyers (DDG). Coontz was decommissioned in 1989, and sold for scrap five years later. Her transom nameplate was salvaged and donated to the city of Hannibal, Missouri, birthplace of Admiral Coontz. Construction and commissioning  Coontzs keel was laid at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in March 1957, 39 years after Admiral Coontz left his post as the shipyard's commander. The first guided-missile frigate to be built on the West Coast, and the second ship to bear the name of the Navy's second chief of naval operations, Coontz was christened by Mrs. Robert J. Coontz, wife of the admiral's grandson, on 6 December 1958. Commanded by Commander H.H. Reis, Coontz was commissioned on 15 July 1960 and completed post-shakedown training in April 1961. Coontz was commissioned 6 months ahead of Farragut, the lead ship of the class, some references refer to the class as Coontz-class frigates/destroyers. Coontz then became a unit of the Cruiser-Destroyer Force U.S. Pacific Fleet and joined the First Fleet as flagship of Destroyer Division 152, home port in San Diego, California. Commander, Destroyer Squadron 15 flew his flag in Coontz from 4 May to 12 July 1961.  DLG-9  Coontz at Puget Sound, circa 1959. Coontz departed from San Diego on 10 August 1961 and joined the Seventh Fleet as a unit of the fast carrier task force. Remaining with the Seventh Fleet for more than seven months, Coontz steamed and visited ports in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, B.C.C, Australia and American Samoa. While conducting training exercises to maintain full combat readiness, Coontz received the coveted \\"E\\" award for excellence in missilery. Coontz returned to the United States on 23 March 1962 to rejoin the U.S. First Fleet and became the flagship of the Commander, Destroyer Squadron 17 in April 1962. On the second anniversary of her awards for excellence in Operations, Engineering and Gunnery, Coontz flew the flag of the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 11 from 1 August to 11 November 1962, when she again became the flagship for Commander, Destroyer Squadron 17. In October 1962 Coontz left San Diego and sailed out to sea about to provide protection for the Camp Pendleton Marine transports just in case they were needed during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Commander James R. Collier relieved Captain Reis in July 1962. Coontz sailed with the Seventh Fleet in Asiatic waters, visiting Yokosuka, Kobe, Kure and Beppu in Japan and Hong Kong, B.C.C in China. During this time Coontz was also designated a stand-by recovery ship for NASA's Mercury-Atlas 8 space mission. During the space flight on 3 October 1962, Wally Schirra orbited the Earth at an altitude of . Although Coontz was listed as a stand-by ship for recovery operations, the vessel was not activated. Coontz returned to the U.S. in May 1963. In June 1963, Coontz demonstrated the kill capability of the Terrier surface-to-air missile in a sea power demonstration for President John F. Kennedy. = First modernization = Coontz was overhauled and her missile weapons systems extensively modernized from October 1963 to April 1964 at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. Commander Eugene C. Kenyon, Jr. relieved Commander Collier on 7 March 1964. Upon rejoining the Pacific Fleet in April 1964, Coontz successfully completed comprehensive weapons systems qualification trials and refresher training. Prior to departure for the Western Pacific on 5 August 1964, Coontz was awarded the Missile, Gunnery and engineering \\"E\\" award for combat excellence in these areas. On 3 August 1964, Coontz again became the flagship for Commander, Destroyer Squadron 17. = First Vietnam tour = Coontz joined the U.S. Seventh Fleet on 16 August 1964 as a unit of the fast carrier task force for six months. She steamed and visited Subic Bay, Philippines, Hong Kong, B.C.C., Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan. In December 1964, Coontz was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for support of Vietnam War operations in the South China Sea. Her third Western Pacific tour completed, Coontz returned to the operational control of the Commander, First Fleet and returned to the United States on 6 February 1965. Operations in the First Fleet included participation in the 1965 summer midshipmen training cruise. Coontz visited Bellingham, Washington; San Francisco, California; and Hilo and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii during this cruise. The \\"E\\", \\"C\\" and \\"A\\" awards were received during this period for excellence in engineering, communications and anti-submarine warfare. On 14 August 1965, Commander W. Cummings relieved Commander Kenyon as commanding officer. = Second modernization = From December 1965 to January 1966, Coontz received a Helicopter Landing and Handling Capability in San Diego. This conversion included relocation of deck vents, clearing all fantail obstructions, installation of a JP-5 fuel handling and purification system, and the introduction of equipment to provide Helicopter Starting and Service power. Coontz was the first of her class to receive the conversion and proudly boasted the addition of a helicopter to her many-faceted capabilities. = Second Vietnam tour = Coontz departed San Diego in January 1966 for a regular deployment as a unit of the U.S. Seventh Fleet for a total of six months. Coontz visited Shimoda, Shizuoka and Yokosuka, Japan; Subic Bay, Philippines, and Kaohsiung, Formosa. In March 1966, Coontz was awarded the Unit Commendation Ribbon for her WESTPAC performance. On 1 July 1966, three North Vietnamese torpedo boats emerged from a port and moved to attack Coontz and , steaming offshore on search and rescue operations. Carrier planes sank all of the torpedo boats with bombs, rockets and cannon fire. Coontz picked up 19 North Vietnamese sailors who were later exchanged for American POWs captured in South Vietnam. After completing her fourth Western Pacific route, Coontz changed operational control of Commander, First Fleet and returned to the United States 1 August 1966. In late September, the ship entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a regular overhaul. After departing Long Beach Naval Shipyard in March 1967, Coontz returned to San Diego and commenced a training and upkeep period. =Third Vietnam tour = Coontz off Oahu, 1968. Coontz departed San Diego for WESTPAC on 25 July 1967. While deployed in the Western Pacific, Coontz was again attached to the U.S. Seventh Fleet and on search- and-rescue duty as well as aircraft carrier operations and special assignments. Commander E. Dale Geiger relieved Commander Cummings as Commanding Officer on 28 July 1967 while Coontz was en route to WESTPAC on her fifth tour with the U.S. Seventh Fleet. In August 1967, Coontz made an operational visit to Jakarta, Indonesia; the first U.S. warship to visit the nation since early 1963. Coontz then spent two 30-day periods in the Northern Search and Rescue Station in the Tonkin Gulf and participated in the rescue of nine aviators. After a brief visit to Hong Kong, B.C.C., Coontz headed for her home port, San Diego, via Sydney, Australia and Wellington, New Zealand, Pago Pago American Samoa and Pearl Harbor, arriving in San Diego 8 February 1968. During the leave and upkeep period a Test and Evaluation Monitoring System (TEAMS) was installed for evaluation during operations with the First Fleet. This was the first automatic test system to be installed in the surface fleet. The operations included participation in the summer midshipmen cruise. Ports visited during this cruise were San Francisco, Seattle, and Pearl Harbor. Coontz then took part in First Fleet operations; including exercise Beat Cadence until Deploying on 15 November 1968. = Fourth Vietnam tour = Coontz arrived on Yankee Station one month later and spent Christmas on the line. On 8 February 1969, Commander Donald P. Roane relieved Commander Geiger as Commanding Officer before Coontz made a visit to Hong Kong, B.C.C. Coontz returned to the Gulf of Tonkin for another Search and Rescue mission before going north for upkeep at Yokosuka, Japan. After an EC-121 aircraft was shot down by North Korean jets, Coontz was rushed into the Sea of Japan. From that assignment, Coontz returned to San Diego via Subic Bay on 18 May. = Third modernization = Leave and upkeep followed. In September 1969, Coontz participated in a HUKASWEX operation at sea as a unit of the First Fleet. After several more sea periods, Coontz went into an extensive upkeep period. During the year of 1969, Coontz won awards for excellence in Supply, Operations and ASW. The upkeep continued until deployment on 3 March 1970. On 8 July 1970, Commander Roane was relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander T.J. Bowen. In January 1971, shortly after her last Seventh Fleet tour, Coontz departed San Diego via the Panama Canal for Atlantic waters and a major overhaul and modernization at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. In conjunction with this work, Coontz DLG-9 was decommissioned on 23 February 1971. After extensive anti-air warfare modification, Coontz was recommissioned on 18 March 1972 and transferred to her new home port of Newport, Rhode Island. Commander T.R.M.Emery was assigned to Coontz as Commanding Officer on 8 March 1972. After a six-month test period in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba and other operations in the Caribbean, Coontz sailed on a \\"show the flag\\" cruise to South America and Africa. Subsequently she entered Boston Naval Shipyard for a three-month Post Shakedown Availability. Following extensive training and preparation, Coontz departed on 6 July 1973 for her first deployment with the United States Sixth Fleet, operating in the Mediterranean Sea. Commander Emery was relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander F.N. Howe on 20 December 1973. In January 1974 Coontz changed home port from Newport to Norfolk, Virginia. She departed 15 November 1974 for a Mediterranean Sea deployment, participating in numerous U.S. and NATO exercises.  DDG-40  As part of a major re-designation of several classes of ships, Coontz was redesignated guided-missile destroyer 40 (DDG 40) on 1 July 1975. The ship's next deployment was on 17 January 1976 as part of the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT). The force operated in Caribbean, U.S. and Canadian waters with ships from four NATO navies prior to a transit to Northern Europe where Coontz visited 8 countries and participated in numerous NATO exercises. Commander Howe was relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander Silas O. Nunn III on 6 March 1976. Nunn was later relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander W. P. Martin on 8 April 1978. After a one-year regular overhaul in Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Coontz departed on 21 July 1978 for comprehensive gunnery, missile and Harpoon system qualifications and refresher training at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. After returning home, Coontz participated in six months of local operations including GULFEX 78 in November 1978. In 1979 she served again with STANAVFORLANT, as flagship, hosting more than 35,000 visitors in 8 NATO countries and participating in various exercises with over 30 NATO ships. STANAVFORLANT operations included areas above the Arctic Circle, in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and the Norwegian Sea. Commander Martin was relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander C.P. Willoz on 28 September 1979. USS Coontz in 1980. On 14 July 1981, Coontz accidentally fired a live Harpoon missile about off St. Croix. The island was in range of the missile and it was fired toward the island, but a search by Coontz and aircraft from the carrier found no debris. The US Navy concluded that the Harpoon harmlessly impacted the sea since no trace of it was ever found. In the fall of 1981, Coontz deployed again. This cruise included port visits in Western Africa as part of the West African Training Cruise, operations in the Mediterranean Sea and a transit into the Black Sea followed by a port visit to Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia. Commander Willoz was relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander J.P. Reason on 6 September 1981. Coontz participated in operations around the Eastern coast of Central America in mid 1982 making the first visit to Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles by a U.S. Navy ship in more than 13 years. In July of that year Coontz entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a one-year regular overhaul, undergoing various configuration changes and equipment additions. During this yard period, Commander Reason was relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander L.P. Brooks, Jr. on 17 December 1982. Coontz completed overhaul on time in July 1983. = Operation Urgent Fury-Grenada = Three months out of overhaul in October 1983, Coontz steamed to the Caribbean Sea for weapons systems testing. While undergoing tests, Coontz received immediate tasking and altered course to join Operation Urgent Fury, the invasion of Grenada. The ship provided gunfire support and small boat interdiction for ten consecutive days in support of the amphibious assault. For this action, Coontz was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary medal and the Meritorious Unit Commendation. = Final operations = In 1984, Coontz underwent pre-deployment work up including refresher training and a major fleet exercise. Upon completion, Coontz deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in October conducting operations in the Eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Beirut, Lebanon and in the Black Sea. Commander Brooks was relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander Charles H. Gnerlich on 25 February 1985. Coontz returned to Norfolk in May 1985. From August to October 1985, Coontz underwent her first Phased Maintenance Availability, a new concept involving short periods of intense industrial work designed to maximize operational availability rather than placing ships in prolonged overhauls. In November 1985, Coontz participated in Operation Bold Eagle, a joint exercise conducted with the US Army and US Air Force in Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. Coontz coordinated with airborne Air Force AWACS aircraft and Army ground units for air defense. Coontz's next joint exercise was Ocean Venture '86. Coontz, along with Navy ships and Coast Guard cutters conducted quarantine operations exercises in the Caribbean operating areas. During this time Coontz requalified her Naval Gunfire Support Team at the Vieques Island Range near Puerto Rico. In November 1986 Coontz was awarded her first and only Battle Efficiency Award. In addition she earned all eight line department awards in the areas of Navigation/Deck Seamanship, Main Propulsion, Damage Control, Anti-Air Warfare, Anti-Submarine Warfare, Anti-Surface Warfare, Electronic Warfare, and Communications. In late 1986 and early 1987, Coontz underwent a work up period in preparation for deployment to the Persian Gulf on 5 February 1987. During her deployment, she served under the Commander, Middle East Forces. Coontz was tasked with ensuring the safe passage of all U.S. vessels as well as maintaining U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf during the escalation of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Commander Gnerlich was relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander William W. Cobb, Jr. on 11 April 1987. During deployment in the Persian Gulf, Coontz provided firefighting teams which aided in the rescue of USS Stark and her crew after she was struck by Iraqi Exocet missiles. Coontz returned to her home port of Norfolk, Virginia on 5 August 1987. Following a three-month maintenance availability (SRA) she operated as part of the United States Second Fleet until the end of her career.  Decommissioning  Commander Cobb was relieved as Commanding Officer by Commander W.E. Cox on 21 July 1989. Commander Cox oversaw the decommissioning of Coontz in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 2 October 1989. She was sold for scrapping in April 1994, but had to be repossessed in October 1996. The ship was sold again in February 1999 to Metro Machine of Philadelphia. Although a few bits and pieces of her remain in private collections, the bulk of the ship was dismantled. The scrapping of USS Coontz was completed on 26 March 2003 in Philadelphia, with the scrap metal being sold to Camden Iron and Metal in Camden, New Jersey. In 2006, the USS Coontz Association, composed of former officers and crew of USS Coontz, obtained the transom of ship from a private collector who had saved it from the scrap heap. The transom, which bears the name of the ship, was then donated to the city of Hannibal, Missouri, birthplace of the ship's namesake, Admiral Robert. E. Coontz. On 31 March 2007, several former crew members of Coontz, Navy deputy chief of information Admiral Nathan Jones and Hannibal city officials dedicated the transom at Nipper Park. The dedication occurred 50 years to the month after the laying of the keel of the ship.

Raytheon engineer William C. Brown's work to adapt magnetron principles to create a new broadband amplifier is generally recognized as the first CFA, which he called an Amplitron. Other names that are sometimes used by CFA manufacturers include Platinotron or Stabilotron. A CFA has lower gain and bandwidth than other microwave amplifier tubes (such as klystrons or traveling-wave tubes); but it is more efficient and capable of much higher output power. Peak output powers of many megawatts and average power levels of tens of kilowatts can be achieved, with efficiency ratings in excess of 70 percent. Their current use is in satellite ground stations and deep space communications networks.  Operation  Crossed-field amplifier internal operation The electric and magnetic fields in a CFA are perpendicular to each other (\\"crossed fields\\"). This is the same type of field interaction used in a magnetron; as a result, the two devices share many characteristics (such as high peak power and efficiency) and they have similar physical appearances. However, a magnetron is an oscillator and a CFA is an amplifier (although a CFA can be driven to oscillate by application of improper low voltages as can any amplifier); a CFA's RF circuit (or slow-wave structure) is similar to that in a coupled-cavity TWT. The CFA has the useful property that when power is shut off, the input simply passes to the output with very little loss. This avoids the need for RF bypass switching in the event of failure. Two CFAs can be connected sequentially with only one powered; if it fails, power can be removed from the primary tube and applied to the secondary as a backup. This approach with built-in redundancy was used on the S-band downlink transmitter on the Apollo Lunar Module where high efficiency and reliability were needed. A large negative voltage is placed on the green electrode in the center, and a large magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the page. This forms a thin spinning disk of electrons with a flow pattern like spinning water as it drains from a sink or toilet. A slow-wave structure is located above and below the spinning disk of electrons. Electrons flow much slower than the speed of light, and the slow wave structure reduces the velocity of the input RF enough to match the electron velocity. The RF input is introduced into the slow wave structure. The alternating microwave field causes the electrons to alternately speed up and slow down. These disturbances grow larger as electrons spiral around the device, and electrons slow down as the RF energy grows. This produces amplification. There is a small amount of RF feedback from output to input. This creates a slight random phase jitter when the device is pulsed.

Shagreen is a type of rawhide consisting of rough untanned skin, historically from a horse's or onager's back, or from shark or ray. In modern times, shagreen is produced from the skins of commercially farmed Asian stingrays. Etymology The word derives from the French chagrin and is related to Italian zigrino and Venetian sagrin, derived from the Turkic saƒürƒ± / √ßaƒürƒ± 'rump of a horse' or the prepared skin of this part. The roughness of its texture led to the French meaning of anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or annoyance.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989, s.v. chagrin and shagreen Uses and preparation The white handle of this tant≈ç (left) is covered with shagreen in its natural form. Shagreen leather used in bookbinding. Two small decorative elephants made of silver and shagreen. Shagreen has an unusually rough and granular surface, and is sometimes used as a fancy leather for book bindings, pocketbooks and small cases, as well as its more utilitarian uses in the hilts and scabbards of swords and daggers, where slipperiness is a disadvantage. In Asia, the Japanese tachi, katana, and wakizashi swords had their hilts almost always covered in undyed rawhide shagreen, while in China, shagreen, whose use dates back to the 2nd century CE,Guth, Christine, \\"Towards a Global History of Shagreen\\" in The Global Lives of Things, ed. by Anne Gerritsen and Giorgio Aiello. London: Rutledge, 2015, p. 66 was traditionally used on Qing dynasty composite bows. Typically the ears and the spaces above and beneath the grip were covered by polished shagreen (in which the calcified papillae are reduced to equal height and form a uniform surface), sometimes with inlay work of different coloured shagreen. Shagreen was a very common cover for 19th-century reading glasses containers as well as other utensil boxes from China. The early horse-skin variety of shagreen was traditionally prepared by embedding plant seeds (often Chenopodium) in the untreated skin while soft, covering the skin with a cloth, and trampling them into the skin. When the skin was dry, the seeds were shaken off, leaving the surface of the leather covered with small indentations. Sources are not clear whether this was being done to imitate pearl ray-skin shagreen from East Asia or if the technique was developed separately. In the 17th and early 18th centuries, the term \\"shagreen\\" began to be applied to leather made from sharkskin or the skin of a rayfish (probably the pearled ray, Hypolophus sephen). This form is also termed sharkskin or galuchat. Such skins are naturally covered with round, closely set, calcified papillae called placoid scales, whose size is chiefly dependent on the age and size of the animal. These scales are ground down to give a roughened surface of rounded pale protrusions, between which the dye (again, typically green vegetable dye) shows when the material is coloured from the other side. This latter form of shagreen was first popularised in Europe by :fr:Jean-Claude Galluchat (d. 1774), a master leatherworker in the court of Louis XV of France. It quickly became a fashion amongst the French aristocracy, and migrated throughout Europe by the mid-18th century. \\"The appeal of shagreen in Europe was closely bound up with the way the translucent skin absorbs colour, but in Japan, its whiteness was the measure of value\\".Guth, p. 64 Scholars concur that its popularity in Central Asia, where green footwear made of shagreen was popular into the 19th century, probably came as the result of its introduction from China perhaps during the 16th century rule of Suleiman the Magnificent.Guth, p. 65) Three items made of shagreen can be found in the Topkapi collection. Since the 18th century Shagreen has typically been used for covering portable items such as luggage, toilet cases and other boxes, the hard and robust looking finish seeming to assure its reputation for standing up to rough handling; book coverings are also known as well as larger pieces of furniture. The water resistant qualities ascribed to the finish are probably why there are many toiletry cases and associated objects such as shaving kits, snuff boxes and other items of a personal nature. The restrained look of the skin was felt to be very suitable for men. Items continued to be manufactured during the 19th century, usually influenced by 18th century examples. There was a definite resurgence in items being made during the 1920s and 1930s, the lean hard finish and traditional pale green tone lending itself very well to the prevailing Art-deco style. Many of these items are designed along modernist lines with little 18th century influence. A broad range of items date from this period including furniture and luggage. In the 1970s, Shagreen became fashionable again, partly due to the renewed interest in the Art-deco period. A range of items, including furniture such as small tables, have been manufactured since then, providing work for a small number of craftspeople catering to the luxury market. Small decorative items made of shagreen and silver have become popular in Southeast Asia; most are manufactured by high- end design studios in Thailand. Medicine In medicine, a shagreen patch is a patch of shagreen-like rough skin, often on the lower back, found in some people with the genetic condition tuberous sclerosis.

Locke's formulation   Overview  The phrase \\"Lockean proviso\\" was coined by libertarian political philosopher Robert Nozick in Anarchy, State, and Utopia.Nozik, Robert (1974). Anarchy, State, and Utopia. p. 175. It is based on the ideas elaborated by John Locke in his Second Treatise of Government, namely that self-ownership allows a person the freedom to mix his or her labor with natural resources, converting common property into private property. Locke concludes that people need to be able to protect the resources they are using to live on their property and that this is a natural right. Nozick used this idea to form his Lockean proviso which governs the initial acquisition of property in a society, but in order for his ideas of ownership of property to get off the ground and be cogent he devised the criterion to determine what makes property acquisition just which is the proviso. The proviso says that although every appropriation of property is a diminution of another's rights to it, it is acceptable as long as it does not make anyone worse off than they would have been without any private property.\\"Social Minimum\\" Locke's proviso has been used by Georgists and socialists to point to land acquisition as illegitimate without compensation. In Georgism, the possession of land is proper only so long as the market rent is paid to the relevant community. If a plot of land has a positive rent, that implies that there is not land of similar quality freely available to others. Libertarians of the modern Austrian School and anarcho-capitalist traditions such as Murray Rothbard have accepted Locke's other views on property whilst rejecting the Lockean proviso. French researcher Ai-Thu Dang has criticized Nozick's reading of the Lockean proviso, saying it denatures its meaning, especially Locke's \\"articulation to moral rules governing enrichment\\".Dang, Ai-Thu, \\"Lib√©ralisme et justice sociale: la clause lock√©enne des droits de propri√©t√©\\".

He is one of the rogues to threaten the Flash, first appearing in the prestige format one-shot The Flash: Iron Heights (2001). Murmur appeared in the third and fourth seasons of the television series Arrow played by Adrian Glynn McMorran. Fictional character biography Dr. Michael Amar, a once respected surgeon, succumbed to madness and started a killing spree to stop the voices inside his head. This spree went through Central and Keystone City and caught the eye of police officers Fred Chyre and Joe Jackam. They later tracked Amar down with the help from Central City forensic scientist, Barry Allen. Part of Amar's psychosis is the inability to stop himself from blurting out his crimes. Because of these outbursts, he is quickly convicted and sentenced to death. It is soon discovered that Amar's blood is so abnormal that lethal injection can not kill him. While incarcerated in Iron Heights prison, Amar cuts out his own tongue and sews his mouth shut so he will no longer be able to incriminate himself. Wearing a thin mask of his own design, Amar becomes known as Murmur. While in prison, Murmur creates a virus that kills the guards and prisoners and escapes during the riots it causes. He then joins Blacksmith, who helps him with creating the virus, and her rogues. Afterwards, Murmur strikes out on his own. Murmur is one of the villains being controlled by the Top during the Rogue War story arc. =Infinite Crisis= In Infinite Crisis #1, Murmur is seen working in Gotham City with the Riddler, the Body Doubles and the Fisherman in a murderous attack on Gotham police officers. He is seen in issue #7 as one member of the Secret Society of Supervillains, participating in an attack on Metropolis. A superhero army stops the Society. Murmur has also teamed up with another Batman villain - Hush - in the Man-Bat miniseries,Man-Bat #1-5 (June- October 2006) which takes place before the Infinite Crisis event. =One Year Later= One year after the events of Infinite Crisis, Murmur has made only one full appearance in the DC Universe. In writer Gail Simone's Secret Six, he is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get-Out-of-Hell-Free card from the team. The only other mention of the villain post-One Year Later is a framed front page newspaper of the Central City Citizen detailing Murmur's arrest and incarceration by police. It is seen on a wall of the Allen household in The Flash: Rebirth #1. =DC Rebirth= Murmur briefly appears in Flash Forward #1 where he stops Double Down from attacking Wally West at Blackgate Penitentiary. Powers and abilities Murmur has no super human powers of a combative nature. All he has is a mutated physiology making him immune to bloodbourne disease or toxins. Other characters named Murmur An earlier supervillain called Murmur appeared in Peter David's Supergirl series (first appearance in issue 33, 1999). This Murmur is a demon in the service of The Carnivore. He has an angel-like appearance, dark blue skin and golden armor. He rides a golden gryphon and wielded a powerful golden lance. In other media * Although Murmur has no major parts in any type of media outside of comics, he makes a very brief, nearly impossible to see cameo in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Flash and Substance\\" as one of the villains in the villain bar. A character closely resembling him can be seen talking to Heat Wave behind far in the background behind Fiddler. * Murmur appears in Arrow portrayed by Adrian Glynn McMorran. Depicted in season three, episode \\"The Offer\\", Michael Amar is revealed to have been beaten into confessing to a crime he did not commit years prior for which he served in Iron Heights. He then proceeded to have his mouth sewn shut. After his release, he went on to seek revenge against the police by stealing diamonds to make diamond-tipped bullets which could pierce their body armor. His plan is foiled and he is subdued by Team Arrow. Later in season four, Damien Darhk is seen in jail with Murmur who has built up a gang in prison. Murmur and his gang beat up Darhk who in revenge forces Murmur to murder his gang and work for H.I.V.E by threatening his grandmother. Murmur contributes to the prison break and the Black Canary's resulting death. Murmur is present as an agent of H.I.V.E, going out and leading squads of soldiers in their missions leading up to Darhk's ultimate goal of global nuclear annihilation. He and Danny Brickwell / Brick are sent by Darhk to kill Noah Kuttler because he is the only one able to disable Rubicon and nuclear missiles. When Amar goes to Star City Data Center to kill them, Oliver and John defeat him and he is presumably arrested.

It covers the period from the 4th century to 1815. The Culavamsa was compiled over many years by Buddhist monks, and displays a variety of epic styles. It is generally considered to be a sequel to the Mahavamsa (\\"Great Chronicle\\") written in the 6th century by the monk Mahanama. The Mahavamsa and the Culavamsa are sometimes thought of as a single work (referred to as the \\"Mahavamsa\\") spanning over two millennia of Sri Lankan history. Contents The Culavamsa is a continuation of the Mahavamsa. But unlike the Mahavamsa it was written by different authors at different periods. The Culavamsa is divided into two parts. The first part, chapters thirty-seven to seventy-nine, begins with the 4th century arrival of a tooth relic of Siddhartha Gautama to Sri Lanka and continues to the reign of Parakramabahu the Great (1153-1186) in the 12th century, and was written in the 13th century. While the authorship of the first part is traditionally ascribed to the Buddhist monk Thera Dhammakitti, many historians now believe it to be a collaborative effort, written by a number of monks. The second part, whose author remains unknown, records Sri Lankan history from the 12th century, with the reign of Vijayabahu II and continues the history of the Sinhalese monarchy to that of Parakramabahu IV (Chaps. 80-90). Within the second part the section of the chronicle which deals with the period from Parakramabahu IV to the death of Kirti Sri Rajasinha was compiled by TibbotuvƒÅve Sumangala Thera, while the last chapter was continued to 1815 by Hikkaduve Siri Sumangala. This portion of the chronicle has not been assigned a definite authorship and is generally considered inferior, both in style and in factual reliability, to Dhammakitti‚Äôs portion. Significance Tradition has it that the work was compiled by the monk Dhammakitti, whom Geiger regards as 'a man of literary culture ... acquainted with Indian Niti literature'. He regards 'the history of Parakkama [sic] as the real kernel, the main subject of the Culavamsa', much in the same way that Dutugemunu's life is the major part of the Mahavamsa. Geiger believes that it is not possible 'to form a harmonious and credible picture of the single acts attributed to the youthful Parakkama [sic]' simply from the information presented in the Lesser Chornicle. The explanation for this lies in the writer's approach to history: That there is a certain amount of truth contained in the text is corroborated by numerous carvings, edicts and monuments still extant in Sri Lanka today ‚Äì e.g., Parakramabahu's wars with Gajabahu II and Manabharana are attested to by at least one rock-carving from this period. Furthermore Geiger also believes that the Culavamsa 'does not consciously relate ... false [information]'. The primary source for Parakramabahu's reign is the Culavamsa. Translation The foremost translation of this work was that of Wilhelm Geiger from Pali into German, completed in 1930. This was subsequently translated into English by Mabel Haynes Bode, and the English translation was revised by Geiger. In 1929 an English edition was published by Oxford University Press, translated by C. M. Rickmers. The British colonial government commissioned a translation into English of the Culavamsa in 1871 and published it alongside George Turnour's translation of the Mahavamsa.  Continuations and related works  In 1871, the British colonial government of Sri Lanka commissioned a 101st chapter of the Culavamsa, covering the period from 1815-1871. In 1935, Yagirala Pannananda, a Buddhist monk, wrote Mahavamsa Part III, a further extension of the Culavamsa, in Sinhala. While not authorized by any government agency or religious organization, it was eventually accepted as part of the larger Mahavamsa/Culavamsa tradition. In 1977, the government of Prime Minister JR Jayawardene established a commission to extend the chronicle to cover the years 1935-1977.

G. Squier, was an American archaeologist, history writer, painter and newspaper editor. Biography thumb Squier was born in Bethlehem, New York, the son of a minister of English heritage and his Palatine German wife. In early youth he worked on a farm, attended and taught school, studied engineering, and became interested in American antiquities. The Panic of 1837 made an engineering career unfeasible, so he pursued literature and journalism. He was associated in the publication of the New York State Mechanic at Albany 1841‚Äì1842. In 1843‚Äì1848, he engaged in journalism in Hartford, Connecticut and then edited the Chillicothe, Ohio, weekly newspaper the Scioto Gazette. During this period, Squier collaborated with physician Edwin H. Davis on the book, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, which was issued in 1848. The work was a landmark in American scientific research, the study of the prehistoric Mound Builders of North America, and the early development of archaeology as a scientific discipline.Stiebing 1984, p.136 The book was the first volume of the Smithsonian Institution's Contributions to Knowledge series and the Institution's first publication. Among Squier and Davis' most important achievements was their systematic approach to analyzing and documenting the sites they surveyed, including the Serpent Mound in Peebles, Ohio, which they discovered in 1846, and the mapping of the Mound City Group in Chillicothe, Ohio, which has been restored using their data and is now part of Hopewell Culture National Historical Park. Squier and Davis's collection of ancient Mound objects is now kept at the British Museum.British Museum Collection He was appointed special charg√© d'affaires to all the Central American states in 1849, and negotiated treaties with Nicaragua, Honduras, and San Salvador. In 1853 he made a second visit to Central America to examine a line for a projected interoceanic railroad, and to make further study of the archaeology of the country. In 1856 he received the medal of the French Geographical Society for his researches. In 1858, he married Miriam Florence Folline who had recently had a previous marriage annulled. About 1860, he became editor- in-chief for Frank Leslie's publishing house, and supervised the publication of the first two volumes of Frank Leslie's Pictorial History of the American Civil War. In 1863 Squier was appointed U. S. commissioner to Peru, where he made an exhaustive investigation of Inca remains and took numerous photographs of them. He later gave a series of 12 lectures on \\"The Inca Empire\\" for the Lowell Institute for their 1866‚Äì67 season.Harriet Knight Smith, The history of the Lowell Institute, Boston: Lamson, Wolffe and Co., 1898. In 1868 he was appointed consul-general of Honduras at New York, and in 1871 he was elected the first president of the Anthropological Institute of New York. He conducted ethnological studies, especially in Nicaragua, Honduras and Peru. On returning from Peru, he continued working for Frank Leslie, but gave it up when his health failed. In 1873, his wife divorced him, and married Leslie a year later. In 1874 his health became so seriously impaired as to preclude further original research, and though he subsequently recovered sufficiently to direct the final preparation and revision of his work on Peru for publication, the affection resulted in his death.

Lee and the Army of the Potomac under Union Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. It soon escalated into a major battle which culminated in the outnumbered and defeated Union forces retreating to the high ground south of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The first-day battle proceeded in three phases as combatants continued to arrive at the battlefield. In the morning, two brigades of Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division (of Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Third Corps) were delayed by dismounted Union cavalrymen under Brig. Gen. John Buford. As infantry reinforcements arrived under Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds of the Union I Corps, the Confederate assaults down the Chambersburg Pike were repulsed, although Gen. Reynolds was killed. By early afternoon, the Union XI Corps, commanded by Major General Oliver Otis Howard, had arrived, and the Union position was in a semicircle from west to north of the town. The Confederate Second Corps under Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell began a massive assault from the north, with Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division attacking from Oak Hill and Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division attacking across the open fields north of town. The Union lines generally held under extremely heavy pressure, although the salient at Barlow's Knoll was overrun. The third phase of the battle came as Rodes renewed his assault from the north and Heth returned with his entire division from the west, accompanied by the division of Maj. Gen. W. Dorsey Pender. Heavy fighting in Herbst's Woods (near the Lutheran Theological Seminary) and on Oak Ridge finally caused the Union line to collapse. Some of the Federals conducted a fighting withdrawal through the town, suffering heavy casualties and losing many prisoners; others simply retreated. They took up good defensive positions on Cemetery Hill and waited for additional attacks. Despite discretionary orders from Robert E. Lee to take the heights \\"if practicable,\\" Richard Ewell chose not to attack. Historians have debated ever since how the battle might have ended differently if he had found it practicable to do so. Background =Military situation= Opposing forces =Union= =Confederate= Morning =Defense by Buford's cavalry= Cavalry delaying action, 7:00-10:00 a.m. On the morning of July 1, Union cavalry in the division of Brigadier General John Buford were awaiting the approach of Confederate infantry forces from the direction of Cashtown, to the northwest. Confederate forces from the brigade of Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew had briefly clashed with Union forces the day before but believed they were Pennsylvania militia of little consequence, not the regular army cavalry that was screening the approach of the Army of the Potomac.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 25-28; Martin, pp. 24, 29, 41. General Buford recognized the importance of the high ground directly to the south of Gettysburg. He knew that if the Confederates could gain control of the heights, Meade's army would have a hard time dislodging them. He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge (proceeding west to east toward the town). These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town, Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill.Sears, p. 155. Early that morning, Reynolds, who was commanding the Left Wing of the Army of the Potomac, ordered his corps to march to Buford's location, with the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) to follow closely behind.Martin, pp. 43, 49; Pfanz, First Day, pp. 41-42. Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, from Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Third Corps, advanced towards Gettysburg. Heth deployed no cavalry and led, unconventionally, with the artillery battalion of Major William J. Pegram.Martin, p. 60. Two infantry brigades followed, commanded by Brig. Gens. James J. Archer and Joseph R. Davis, proceeding easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. Three miles (5 km) west of town, about 7:30 a.m., Heth's two brigades met light resistance from cavalry vedettes and deployed into line. Eventually, they reached dismounted troopers from Col. William Gamble's cavalry brigade. The first shot of the battle was claimed to be fired by Lieutenant Marcellus E. Jones of the 8th Illinois Cavalry, fired at an unidentified man on a gray horse over a half-mile away; the act was merely symbolic.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 52-56; Martin, pp. 63-64. Buford's 2,748 troopers would soon be faced with 7,600 Confederate infantrymen, deploying from columns into line of battle.Eicher, p. 510. Buford's cavalry resists the Confederate advance Gamble's men mounted determined resistance and delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It is a modern myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, they were able to fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 57, 59, 74; Martin, pp. 82-88, 96-97. =Davis versus Cutler= Davis vs. Cutler, 10:00-10:45 a.m. The morning infantry fighting occurred on either side of the Chambersburg Pike, mostly on McPherson Ridge. To the north, an unfinished railroad bed opened three shallow cuts in the ridges. To the south, the dominant features were Willoughby Run and Herbst Woods (sometimes called McPherson Woods, but they were the property of John Herbst). Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler's Union brigade opposed Davis's brigade; three of Cutler's regiments were north of the Pike, two to the south. To the left of Cutler, Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith's Iron Brigade opposed Archer.Pfanz, First Day, p. 60; Martin, p. 103. General Reynolds directed both brigades into position and placed guns from the Maine battery of Capt. James A. Hall where Calef's had stood earlier.Martin, pp. 102, 104. While the general rode his horse along the east end of Herbst Woods, shouting \\"Forward men! Forward for God's sake, and drive those fellows out of the woods,\\" he fell from his horse, killed instantly by a bullet striking him behind the ear. (Some historians believe Reynolds was felled by a sharpshooter, but it is more likely that he was killed by random shot in a volley of rifle fire directed at the 2nd Wisconsin.) Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday assumed command of the I Corps.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 77-78; Martin, pp. 140-43. On the right of the Union line, three regiments of Cutler's brigade were fired on by Davis's brigade before they could get into position on the ridge. Davis's line overlapped the right of Cutler's, making the Union position untenable, and Wadsworth ordered Cutler's regiments back to Seminary Ridge. The commander of the 147th New York, Lt. Col. Francis C. Miller, was shot before he could inform his troops of the withdrawal, and they remained to fight under heavy pressure until a second order came. In under 30 minutes, 45% of Gen. Cutler's 1,007 men became casualties, with the 147th losing 207 of its 380 officers and men.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 13. Some of Davis's victorious men turned toward the Union positions south of the railroad bed while others drove east toward Seminary Ridge. This defocused the Confederate effort north of the pike.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 81-90. =Archer versus Meredith= Archer vs. Meredith, 10:45 a.m. South of the pike, Archer's men were expecting an easy fight against dismounted cavalrymen and were astonished to recognize the black Hardee hats worn by the men facing them through the woods: the famous Iron Brigade, formed from regiments in the Western states of Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, had a reputation as fierce, tenacious fighters. As the Confederates crossed Willoughby Run and climbed the slope into Herbst Woods, they were enveloped on their right by the longer Union line, the reverse of the situation north of the pike.Martin, pp. 149-61; Pfanz, First Day, pp. 91-98; Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 13. Brig. Gen. Archer was captured in the fighting, the first general officer in Robert E. Lee's army to suffer that fate. Archer was most likely positioned around the 14th Tennessee when he was captured by Private Patrick Moloney of Company G., 2nd Wisconsin, \\"a brave patriotic and fervent young Irishman.\\" Archer resisted capture, but Moloney overpowered him. Moloney was killed later that day, but he received the Medal of Honor for his exploit. When Archer was taken to the rear, he encountered his former Army colleague Gen. Doubleday, who greeted him good-naturedly, \\"Good morning, Archer! How are you? I am glad to see you!\\" Archer replied, \\"Well, I am not glad to see you by a damn sight!\\"Martin, pp. 160-61; Pfanz, First Day, pp. 100-101. =Railroad cut= Fighting at the railroad cut, 11:00 a.m. At around 11 a.m., Doubleday sent his reserve regiment, the 6th Wisconsin, an Iron Brigade regiment, commanded by Lt. Col. Rufus R. Dawes, north in the direction of Davis's disorganized brigade. The Wisconsin men paused at the fence along the pike and fired, which halted Davis's attack on Cutler's men and caused many of them to seek cover in the unfinished railroad cut. The 6th joined the 95th New York and the 84th New York (also known as the 14th Brooklyn), a \\"demi-brigade\\" commanded by Col. E.B. Fowler, along the pike. The three regiments charged to the railroad cut, where Davis's men were seeking cover. The majority of the 600-foot (180 m) cut (shown on the map as the center cut of three) was too deep to be an effective firing position--as deep as 15 feet (4.5 m).Martin, p. 125. Making the situation more difficult was the absence of their overall commander, General Davis, whose location was unknown.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 102-14. The men of the three regiments nevertheless faced daunting fire as they charged toward the cut. The 6th Wisconsin's American flag went down at least three times during the charge. At one point Dawes took up the fallen flag before it was seized from him by a corporal of the color guard. As the Union line neared the Confederates, its flanks became folded back and it took on the appearance of an inverted V. When the Union men reached the railroad cut, vicious hand-to-hand and bayonet fighting broke out. They were able to pour enfilading fire from both ends of the cut, and many Confederates considered surrender. Colonel Dawes took the initiative by shouting \\"Where is the colonel of this regiment?\\" Major John Blair of the 2nd Mississippi stood up and responded, \\"Who are you?\\" Dawes replied, \\"I command this regiment. Surrender or I will fire.\\"Pfanz, First Day, p. 112. Dawes later described what happened next:Martin, p. 131. Despite this surrender, leaving Dawes standing awkwardly holding seven swords, the fighting continued for minutes more and numerous Confederates were able to escape back to Herr Ridge. The three Union regiments lost 390-440 of 1,184 engaged, but they had blunted Davis's attack, prevented them from striking the rear of the Iron Brigade, and so overwhelmed the Confederate brigade that it was unable to participate significantly in combat for the rest of the day. The Confederate losses were about 500 killed and wounded and over 200 prisoners out of 1,707 engaged.Martin, p. 140. Midday lull Disposition of forces, 12:30 p.m. By 11:30 a.m., the battlefield was temporarily quiet. On the Confederate side, Henry Heth faced an embarrassing situation. He had been under orders from General Lee to avoid a general engagement until the full Army of Northern Virginia had concentrated in the area. But his excursion to Gettysburg, ostensibly to find shoes, was essentially a reconnaissance in force conducted by a full infantry division. This indeed had started a general engagement and Heth was on the losing side so far. By 12:30 p.m., his remaining two brigades, under Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew and Col. John M. Brockenbrough, had arrived on the scene, as had the division (four brigades) of Maj. Gen. Dorsey Pender, also from Hill's Corps. Hill's remaining division (Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson) did not arrive until late in the day.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 117-19; Martin, pp. 186-89. Considerably more Confederate forces were on the way, however. Two divisions of the Second Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, were approaching Gettysburg from the north, from the towns of Carlisle and York. The five brigades of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes marched down the Carlisle Road but left it before reaching town to advance down the wooded crest of Oak Ridge, where they could link up with the left flank of Hill's Corps. The four brigades under Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early approached on the Harrisburg Road. Union cavalry outposts north of the town detected both movements. Ewell's remaining division (Maj. Gen. Edward \\"Allegheny\\" Johnson) did not arrive until late in the day.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 148, 228; Martin, pp. 204-206. On the Union side, Doubleday reorganized his lines as more units of the I Corps arrived. First on hand was the Corps Artillery under Col. Charles S. Wainwright, followed by two brigades from Doubleday's division, now commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Rowley, which Doubleday placed on either end of his line. The XI Corps arrived from the south before noon, moving up the Taneytown and Emmitsburg Roads. Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard was surveying the area from the roof of the Fahnestock Brothers' dry-goods store downtown at about 11:30Martin, p. 198 when he heard that Reynolds had been killed and that he was now in command of all Union forces on the field. He recalled: \\"My heart was heavy and the situation was grave indeed, but surely I did not hesitate a moment. God helping us, we will stay here till the Army comes. I assumed the command of the field.\\"Pfanz, First Day, pp. 123, 124, 128, 137; Martin, p. 198. Howard immediately sent messengers to summon reinforcements from the III Corps (Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles) and the XII Corps (Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum). Howard's first XI Corps division to arrive, under Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz, was sent north to take a position on Oak Ridge and link up with the right of the I Corps. (The division was commanded temporarily by Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig while Schurz filled in for Howard as XI Corps commander.) The division of Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow was placed on Schurz's right to support him. The third division to arrive, under Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr, was placed on Cemetery Hill along with two batteries of artillery to hold the hill as a rallying point if the Union troops could not hold their positions; this placement on the hill corresponded with orders sent earlier in the day to Howard by Reynolds just before he was killed.Martin, pp. 198-202; Pfanz, First Day, pp. 137, 140, 216. However, Rodes beat Schurz to Oak Hill, so the XI Corps division was forced to take up positions in the broad plain north of the town, below and to the east of Oak Hill.Pfanz, Battle of Gettysburg, p. 15. They linked up with the I Corps reserve division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, whose two brigades had been sent forward by Doubleday when he heard about Ewell's arrival.Pfanz, First Day, p. 130. Howard's defensive line was not a particularly strong one in the north.Pfanz, First Day, p. 238. He was soon outnumbered (his XI Corps, still suffering the effects of their defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville, had only 8,700 effectives), and the terrain his men occupied in the north was poorly selected for defense. He held out some hope that reinforcements from Slocum's XII Corps would arrive up the Baltimore Pike in time to make a difference.Pfanz, First Day, p. 158. Afternoon Rodes, Heth, and Early attack, 2:00-4:00 p.m. In the afternoon, there was fighting both west (Hill's Corps renewing their attacks on the I Corps) and north (Ewell's Corps attacking the I and XI Corps) of Gettysburg. Ewell, on Oak Hill with Rodes, saw Howard's troops deploying before him, and he interpreted this as the start of an attack and implicit permission to set aside Gen. Lee's order not to bring about a general engagement.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 161-62. =Rodes attacks from Oak Hill= Rodes initially sent three brigades south against Union troops that represented the right flank of the I Corps and the left flank of the XI Corps: from east to west, Brig. Gen. George P. Doles, Col. Edward A. O'Neal, and Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson. Doles's Georgia brigade stood guarding the flank, awaiting the arrival of Early's division. Both O'Neal's and Iverson's attacks fared poorly against the six veteran regiments in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Henry Baxter, manning a line in a shallow inverted V, facing north on the ridge behind the Mummasburg Road. O'Neal's men were sent forward without coordinating with Iverson on their flank and fell back under heavy fire from the I Corps troops.Martin, pp. 205-210; Pfanz, First Day, pp. 163-66. Iverson failed to perform even a rudimentary reconnaissance and sent his men forward blindly while he stayed in the rear (as had O'Neal, minutes earlier). More of Baxter's men were concealed in woods behind a stone wall and rose to fire withering volleys from less than away, creating over 800 casualties among the 1,350 North Carolinians. Stories are told about groups of dead bodies lying in almost parade-ground formations, heels of their boots perfectly aligned. (The bodies were later buried on the scene, and this area is today known as \\"Iverson's Pits\\", source of many local tales of supernatural phenomena.)Martin, pp. 224-38; Pfanz, First Day, pp. 170-78. Baxter's brigade was worn down and out of ammunition. At 3:00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade, and Gen. Robinson replaced it with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Gabriel R. Paul. Rodes then committed his two reserve brigades: Brig. Gens. Junius Daniel and Dodson Ramseur. Ramseur attacked first, but Paul's brigade held its crucial position. Paul had a bullet go in one temple and out the other, blinding him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle). Before the end of the day, three other commanders of that brigade were wounded.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 182-84; Martin, pp. 247-55. Daniel's North Carolina brigade then attempted to break the I Corps line to the southwest along the Chambersburg Pike. They ran into stiff resistance from Col. Roy Stone's Pennsylvania \\"Bucktail Brigade\\" in the same area around the railroad cut as the morning's battle. Fierce fighting eventually ground to a standstill.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 194-213; Martin, pp. 238-47. =Heth renews his attack= Gen. Lee arrived on the battlefield at about 2:30 p.m., as Rodes's men were in mid-attack. Seeing that a major assault was underway, he lifted his restriction on a general engagement and gave permission to Hill to resume his attacks from the morning. First in line was Heth's division again, with two fresh brigades: Pettigrew's North Carolinians and Col. John M. Brockenbrough's Virginians.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 275-76; Martin, p. 341. North Carolinians drove back federal troops in the first day at Gettysburg. At far left background is the Railroad Cut; at right is the Lutheran Seminary. In the background is Gettysburg. Pettigrew's Brigade was deployed in a line that extended south beyond the ground defended by the Iron Brigade. Enveloping the left flank of the 19th Indiana, Pettigrew's North Carolinians, the largest brigade in the army, drove back the Iron Brigade in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. The Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods, made three temporary stands in the open ground to the east, but then had to fall back toward the Lutheran Theological Seminary. Gen. Meredith was downed with a head wound, made all the worse when his horse fell on him. To the left of the Iron Brigade was the brigade of Col. Chapman Biddle, defending open ground on McPherson Ridge, but they were outflanked and decimated. To the right, Stone's Bucktails, facing both west and north along the Chambersburg Pike, were attacked by both Brockenbrough and Daniel.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 276-93; Martin, p. 342. Casualties were severe that afternoon. The 26th North Carolina (the largest regiment of the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. Their commander, Colonel Henry K. Burgwyn, was fatally wounded by a bullet through his chest. By the end of the three-day battle, they had about 152 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South.Busey and Martin, pp. 298, 501. One of the Union regiments, the 24th Michigan, lost 399 of 496.Busey and Martin, pp. 22, 386. It had nine color bearers shot down, and its commander, Col. Henry A. Morrow, was wounded in the head and captured. The 151st Pennsylvania of Biddle's brigade lost 337 of 467.Busey and Martin, pp. 27, 386. The highest ranking casualty of this engagement was Gen. Heth, who was struck by a bullet in the head. He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of paper into a new hat, which was otherwise too large for his head.Martin, p. 366; Pfanz, First Day, p. 292. But there were two consequences to this glancing blow. Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three-day battle. He was also unable to urge Pender's division to move forward and supplement his struggling assault. Pender was oddly passive during this phase of the battle; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee's army would have seen him move forward on his own accord. Hill shared the blame for failing to order him forward as well, but he claimed illness. History cannot know Pender's motivations; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report.Martin, p. 395. =Early attacks XI Corps= Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard of the XI Corps had a difficult defensive problem. He had only two divisions (four brigades) to cover the wide expanse of featureless farmland north of town. He and Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz, temporarily in command of the corps while Howard was in overall command on the field, deployed the division of Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig on the left and Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow on the right. From the left, the brigades were Schimmelfennig's (under Col. George von Amsberg), Col. W≈Çodzimierz Krzy≈ºanowski, Brig. Gen. Adelbert Ames, and Col. Leopold von Gilsa. Howard recalled that he selected this line as a logical continuation of the I Corps line formed on his left. This decision has been criticized by historians, such as Edwin B. Coddington, as being too far forward, with a right flank vulnerable to envelopment by the enemy. (Coddington suggests that a more defensible line would have been along Stevens Run, about 600 feet north of the railroad, a shorter line to defend, with better fields of fire, and with a more secure right flank.)Coddington, p. 301; Pfanz, First Day, pp. 218-23; Martin, p. 285. Making the Federal defense more difficult, Barlow advanced farther north than Schimmelfennig's division, occupying a 50-foot (15 m) elevation above Rock Creek named Blocher's Knoll (known today as Barlow's Knoll).Pfanz, First Day, p. 217. Barlow's justification was that he wanted to prevent Doles's Brigade, of Rodes's division, from occupying it and using it as an artillery platform against him. General Schurz claimed afterward that Barlow had misunderstood his orders by taking this position. (In Schurz's official report, however, although he also states that Barlow misunderstood his order, he further states that Barlow \\"had been directing the movements of his troops with the most praiseworthy coolness and intrepidity, unmindful of the shower of bullets around,\\" and \\"was severely wounded, and had to be carried off the battle-field.\\" Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz, Gettysburg Campaign, O.R. Series I, Volume XXVII/1 [S# 43].) By taking the knoll, Barlow was following Howard's directive to obstruct the advance of Early's division, and in doing so, deprive him of an artillery platform, as von Steinwehr fortified the position on Cemetery Hill. The position on the knoll turned out to be unfortunate, as it created a salient in the line that could be assaulted from multiple sides. Schurz ordered Krzy≈ºanowski's brigade, which had heretofore been sitting en masse at the north end of town (without further order to position from Schurz) forward to assist Barlow's two brigades on the knoll, but they arrived too late and in insufficient numbers to help. Historian Harry W. Pfanz judges Barlow's decision to be a \\"blunder\\" that \\"ensured the defeat of the corps.\\"Pfanz, First Day, pp. 230-31; Coddington, p. 301; Martin, pp. 276-77; Adkins, p. 379; Petruzzi and Stanley, pp. 46-47. Richard Ewell's second division, under Jubal Early, swept down the Harrisburg Road, deployed in a battle line three brigades wide, almost a mile across (1,600 m) and almost half a mile (800 m) wider than the Union defensive line. Early started with a large-scale artillery bombardment. The Georgia brigade of Brigadier-General John B. Gordon was then directed for a frontal attack against Barlow's Knoll, pinning down the defenders, while the brigades of Brigadier-General Harry T. Hays and Colonel Isaac E. Avery swung around their exposed flank. At the same time the Georgians under Doles launched a synchronized assault with Gordon. The defenders of Barlow's Knoll targeted by Gordon were 900 men of von Gilsa's brigade; in May, two of his regiments had been the initial target of Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's flanking attack at Chancellorsville. The men of the 54th and 68th New York held out as long as they could, but they were overwhelmed. Then the 153rd Pennsylvania succumbed. Barlow, attempting to rally his troops, was shot in the side and captured. Barlow's second brigade, under Ames, came under attack by Doles and Gordon. Both Union brigades conducted a disorderly retreat to the south.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 229-48; Martin, pp. 277-91. The left flank of the XI Corps was held by Gen. Schimmelfennig's division. They were subjected to a deadly artillery crossfire from Rodes' and Early's batteries, and as they deployed they were attacked by Doles' infantry. Doles' and Early's troops were able to employ a flanking attack and roll up three brigade of the corps from the right, and they fell back in confusion toward the town. A desperate counterattack by the 157th New York from von Amsberg's brigade was surrounded on three sides, causing it to suffer 307 casualties (75%).Martin, p. 302; Pfanz, First Day, pp. 254-57. Gen. Howard, witnessing this disaster, sent forward an artillery battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr's reserve force, under Col. Charles Coster. Coster's battle line just north of the town in Kuhn's brickyard was overwhelmed by Hays and Avery. He provided valuable cover for the retreating soldiers, but at a high price: of Coster's 800 men, 313 were captured, as were two of the four guns from the battery.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 258-68; Martin, pp. 306-23. The collapse of the XI Corps was completed by 4 p.m., after a fight of less than an hour. They suffered 3,200 casualties (1,400 of them prisoners), about half the number sent forward from Cemetery Hill. The losses in Gordon's and Doles's brigades were under 750.Sears, p. 217. =Rodes and Pender break through= Rodes and Pender break through, 4:00 p.m. Rodes's original faulty attack at 2:00 had stalled, but he launched his reserve brigade, under Ramseur, against Paul's Brigade in the salient on the Mummasburg Road, with Doles's Brigade against the left flank of the XI Corps. Daniel's Brigade resumed its attack, now to the east against Baxter on Oak Ridge. This time Rodes was more successful, mostly because Early coordinated an attack on his flank.Martin, pp. 386-93. In the west, the Union troops had fallen back to the Seminary and built hasty breastworks running north-south before the western face of Schmucker Hall, bolstered by 20 guns of Wainwright's battalion. Dorsey Pender's division of Hill's Corps stepped through the exhausted lines of Heth's men at about 4:00 p.m. to finish off the I Corps survivors. The brigade of Brig. Gen. Alfred M. Scales attacked first, on the northern flank. His five regiments of 1,400 North Carolinians were virtually annihilated in one of the fiercest artillery barrages of the war, rivaling Pickett's Charge to come, but on a more concentrated scale. Twenty guns spaced only apart fired spherical case, explosive shells, canister, and double canister rounds into the approaching brigade, which emerged from the fight with only 500 men standing and a single lieutenant in command. Scales wrote afterwards that he found \\"only a squad here and there marked the place where regiments had rested.\\"Pfanz, First Day, pp. 305-11; Martin, pp. 394-404; Sears, p. 218. The attack continued in the southern-central area, where Col. Abner M. Perrin ordered his South Carolina brigade (four regiments of 1,500 men) to advance rapidly without pausing to fire. Perrin was prominently on horseback leading his men but miraculously was untouched. He directed his men to a weak point in the breastworks on the Union left, a gap between Biddle's left-hand regiment, the 121st Pennsylvania, and Gamble's cavalrymen, attempting to guard the flank. They broke through, enveloping the Union line and rolling it up to the north as Scales's men continued to pin down the right flank. By 4:30 p.m., the Union position was untenable, and the men could see the XI Corps retreating from the northern battle, pursued by masses of Confederates. Doubleday ordered a withdrawal east to Cemetery Hill.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 311-17; Martin, pp. 404-26. On the southern flank, the North Carolina brigade of Brig. Gen. James H. Lane contributed little to the assault; he was kept busy by a clash with Union cavalry on the Hagerstown Road. Brig. Gen. Edward L. Thomas's Georgia Brigade was in reserve well to the rear, not summoned by Pender or Hill to assist or exploit the breakthrough.Martin, pp. 426-29; Pfanz, First Day, p. 302. =Union retreat= Confederate POWS after the Battle of Gettysburg.Frassanito pp.70-71 Gettysburg in 1863, north of town, viewed from the area of the Lutheran Theological Seminary The sequence of retreating units remains unclear. Each of the two corps cast blame on the other. There are three main versions of events extant. The first, most prevalent, version is that the fiasco on Barlow's Knoll triggered a collapse that ran counterclockwise around the line. The second is that both Barlow's line and the Seminary defense collapsed at about the same time. The third is that Robinson's division in the center gave way and that spread both left and right. Gen. Howard told Gen. Meade that his corps was forced to retreat only because the I Corps collapsed first on his flank, which may have reduced his embarrassment but was unappreciated by Doubleday and his men. (Doubleday's career was effectively ruined by Howard's story.)Sears, p. 224. Union troops retreated in different states of order. The brigades on Seminary Ridge were said to move deliberately and slowly, keeping in control, although Col. Wainwright's artillery was not informed of the order to retreat and found themselves alone. When Wainwright realized his situation, he ordered his gun crews to withdraw at a walk, not wishing to panic the infantry and start a rout. As pressure eventually increased, Wainwright ordered his 17 remaining guns to gallop down Chambersburg Street, three abreast.Sears, p. 220; Martin, p. 446. A.P. Hill failed to commit any of his reserves to the pursuit of the Seminary defenders, a great missed opportunity.Pfanz, First Day, p. 320; Sears, p. 223. Near the railroad cut, Daniel's Brigade renewed their assault, and almost 500 Union soldiers surrendered and were taken prisoner. Paul's Brigade, under attack by Ramseur, became seriously isolated and Gen. Robinson ordered it to withdraw. He ordered the 16th Maine to hold its position \\"at any cost\\" as a rear guard against the enemy pursuit. The regiment, commanded by Col. Charles Tilden, returned to the stone wall on the Mummasburg Road, and their fierce fire gave sufficient time for the rest of the brigade to escape, which they did, in considerably more disarray than those from the Seminary. The 16th Maine started the day with 298 men, but at the end of this holding action there were only 35 survivors.Martin, pp. 379, 389-92. For the XI Corps, it was a sad reminder of their retreat at Chancellorsville in May. Under heavy pursuit by Hays and Avery, they clogged the streets of the town; no one in the corps had planned routes for this contingency. Hand-to-hand fighting broke out in various places. Parts of the corps conducted an organized fighting retreat, such as Coster's stand in the brickyard. The private citizens of Gettysburg panicked amidst the turmoil, and artillery shells bursting overhead and fleeing refugees added to the congestion. Some soldiers sought to avoid capture by hiding in basements and in fenced backyards. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig was one such person who climbed a fence and hid behind a woodpile in the kitchen garden of the Garlach family for the rest of the three-day battle.Pfanz, First Day, pp. 328-29. The only advantage that the XI Corps soldiers had was that they were familiar with the route to Cemetery Hill, having passed through that way in the morning; many in the I Corps, including senior officers, did not know where the cemetery was.Martin, p. 333. As the Union troops climbed Cemetery Hill, they encountered the determined Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock. At midday, Gen. Meade was nine miles (14 km) south of Gettysburg in Taneytown, Maryland, when he heard that Reynolds had been killed. He immediately dispatched Hancock, commander of the II Corps and his most trusted subordinate, to the scene with orders to take command of the field and to determine whether Gettysburg was an appropriate place for a major battle. (Meade's original plan had been to man a defensive line on Pipe Creek, a few miles south in Maryland. But the serious battle underway was making that a difficult option.)Pfanz, First Day, pp. 337-38; Sears, pp. 223-25. When Hancock arrived on Cemetery Hill, he met with Howard and they had a brief disagreement about Meade's command order. As the senior officer, Howard yielded only grudgingly to Hancock's direction. Although Hancock arrived after 4:00 p.m. and commanded no units on the field that day, he took control of the Union troops arriving on the hill and directed them to defensive positions with his \\"imperious and defiant\\" (and profane) persona. As to the choice of Gettysburg as the battlefield, Hancock told Howard \\"I think this the strongest position by nature upon which to fight a battle that I ever saw.\\" When Howard agreed, Hancock concluded the discussion: \\"Very well, sir, I select this as the battle-field.\\" Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac, inspected the ground and concurred with Hancock.Martin, pp. 482-88. Evening General Lee also understood the defensive potential to the Union army if they held the high ground of Cemetery Hill. He sent orders to Ewell to \\"carry the hill occupied by the enemy, if he found it practicable, but to avoid a general engagement until the arrival of the other divisions of the army.\\" In the face of this discretionary, and possibly contradictory, order, Ewell chose not to attempt the assault.Sears, p. 227; Martin, p. 504; Mackowski and White, p. 35. One reason posited was the battle fatigue of his men in the late afternoon, although \\"Allegheny\\" Johnson's division of Ewell's Corps was within an hour of arriving on the battlefield. Another was the difficulty of assaulting the hill through the narrow corridors afforded by the streets of Gettysburg immediately to the north. Ewell requested assistance from A.P. Hill, but that general felt his corps was too depleted from the day's battle and General Lee did not want to bring up Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division from the reserve. Ewell did consider taking Culp's Hill, which would have made the Union position on Cemetery Hill untenable. However, Jubal Early opposed the idea when it was reported that Union troops (probably Slocum's XII Corps) were approaching on the York Pike, and he sent the brigades of John B. Gordon and Brig. Gen. William \\"Extra Billy\\" Smith to block that perceived threat; Early urged waiting for Johnson's division to take the hill. After Johnson's division arrived via the Chambersburg Pike, it maneuvered toward the east of town in preparation to take the hill, but a small reconnaissance party sent in advance encountered a picket line of the 7th Indiana Infantry, which opened fire and captured a Confederate officer and soldier. The remainder of the Confederates fled and attempts to seize Culp's Hill on July 1 came to an end.Mackowski and White, pp. 36-41; Bearss, pp. 171-72; Coddington, pp. 317-21; Gottfried, p. 549; Pfanz, First Day, pp. 347-49; Martin, p. 510. Lee's order has been criticized because it left too much discretion to Ewell. Numerous historians and proponents of the Lost Cause movement (most prominently Jubal Early, despite his own reluctance to support an attack at the time) have speculated how the more aggressive Stonewall Jackson would have acted on this order if he had lived to command this wing of Lee's army, and how differently the second day of battle would have proceeded with Confederate artillery on Cemetery Hill, commanding the length of Cemetery Ridge and the Federal lines of communications on the Baltimore Pike.See, for instance, Pfanz, First Day, pp. 345-46, or Martin, pp. 563-65. Stephen W. Sears has suggested that Gen. Meade would have invoked his original plan for a defensive line on Pipe Creek and withdrawn the Army of the Potomac, although that movement would have been a dangerous operation under pressure from Lee.Sears, pp. 233-34. Most of the rest of both armies arrived that evening or early the next morning. Johnson's division joined Ewell and Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's joined Hill. Two of the three divisions of the First Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, arrived in the morning. Three cavalry brigades under Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart were still out of the area, on a wide-ranging raid to the northeast. Gen. Lee sorely felt the loss of the \\"eyes and ears of the Army\\"; Stuart's absence had contributed to the accidental start of the battle that morning and left Lee unsure about enemy dispositions through most of July 2. On the Union side, Meade arrived after midnight. The II Corps and III Corps took up positions on Cemetery Ridge, and the XII Corps and the V Corps were nearby to the east. Only the VI Corps was a significant distance from the battlefield, marching rapidly to join the Army of the Potomac.Eicher, p. 520; Martin, p. 537. The first day at Gettysburg--more significant than simply a prelude to the bloody second and third days--ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged. About one quarter of Meade's army (22,000 men) and one third of Lee's army (27,000) were engaged.Martin, p. 9, citing Thomas L. Livermore's Numbers & Losses in the Civil War in America (Houghton Mifflin, 1900). Union casualties were almost 9,000, Confederate slightly more than 6,000.Trudeau, p. 272.

History Born Leonid Molodozhanyn in Polonne, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), and raised in Russia (Krasnoyarsk, Prokhladny, Nalchik and Leningrad), Mol learned the art of ceramics in his father's pottery workshop. As a young man, he wanted to study painting in Vienna and spent several years studying there under the tutelage of Wilhelm Frass. With Frass's recommendation, Mol was then hired by the sculptor Frans Klimsh, who would support his application to the Berlin Academy. Mol also studied sculpture at the Leningrad Academy of Arts from 1936 to 1940. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union he deported to Germany where he was influenced by Arno Breker. In 1945, he moved to The Hague, and in December, 1948, he and his wife, Margareth (whom he married in 1943), emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1948. In 1949, he held his first ceramics exhibition in Winnipeg. Mol was known for his sculptures of square dancers, skiers, aboriginals, and wildlife. Mol also completed more than 80 stained-glass windows in churches throughout Winnipeg. More than three hundred of Mol's works are displayed in the 1.2 hectare Leo Mol Sculpture Garden in Winnipeg's Assiniboine Park which comprises a gallery, a renovated studio, and an outdoor display. The garden was unveiled on June 18, 1992 and has been expanded twice since. It is supported by private donations, and Mol personally donated 200 bronze sculptures to the city of Winnipeg. The sculptures are of religious leaders, prominent people, the human form, and wildlife. Postage stamp Mol died July 4, 2009, at St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He was 94.

The festival deals with quality documentary films on social, political, environmental, media and human rights issues. One World presents over 120 documentary films from all around the globe and organizes numerous Q&As; with filmmakers and experts.  History  Established in 1999 by Igor Bla≈æeviƒç and the Czech NGO People in Need, the One World Festival presents over 100 documentary films during nine days in Spring from around the world. It is a founding member of the Human Rights Film Network, which brings together 33 festivals around the world. In 2006, the festival received a Special Mention from UNESCO for its contribution to human rights and peace education. Three years later, in 2009, One World published a handbook entitled Setting Up a Human Rights Film Festival, which offers practical advice as well as case studies of prominent human rights events. In 2018, the One World Festival was in its 20th year and took place from 5‚Äì14 March, presenting 128 documentaries and 9 virtual reality projects from more than 40 countries around the world. In the same year the festival and the NGO People in Need published the handbook Explore Impact: How To Reach New Audiences And Boost Impact, that should serve as an inspiration guide for festival (or other cultural events) organizers, who care about the social dimension and impact of their work. One World was held under the auspices of V√°clav Havel, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg, the Minister of Culture Ji≈ô√≠ Besser, and the Mayor of Prague Bohuslav Svoboda. The 2020 edition of the festival was postponed due to rising concerns over COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. Competitions and awards One World's programme consists of three competition categories, a variety of non-competition thematic categories as well as Docs for Kids section. Films are judged by One World's selection committee, that concentrates equally on both human rights content and artistic quality. Six main awards are given to the winning films: *International Competition Award *Award for the Best Director in the International Competition *The V√°clav Havel Jury Award for a film that makes an exceptional contribution to the defense of human rights *Czech Competition Award *Audience Award *Student Jury Award Homo Homini Award During the festival, People in Need grants the annual Homo Homini Award to individuals in recognition of a dedication to promote human rights, democracy and nonviolent solutions to political conflicts. The 2011 award went to the underground network of Syrian doctors, Doctors Coordinate of Damascus, for their work in aiding victims of violence in Syria.

She is also a published author. Education Born in Flushing, Queens, New York, Abramson graduated from Queens College, and in 1969 received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from UCLA School of Law.John R. Vile, Great American Lawyers: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1 (2001), p. 287. Career =Early career= In 1970, Abramson was admitted to the State Bar of California. She began her career in the Los Angeles County Public Defender's office, where she worked for six years. She entered private practice as a defense attorney in 1976, and developed a reputation as a fierce advocate for her clients. She was twice named trial lawyer of the year by the L.A. Criminal Courts Bar Association. Over the course of her career, only one client that she represented received the death penalty - a multiple murderer named Ricky Sanders, who shot eleven people in a walk-in freezer in a Bob's Big Boy restaurant, killing four of them. In 1988, Abramson was able to obtain a verdict of manslaughter with a sentence of probation, rather than murder, for 17-year old Arnel Salvatierra, who had killed his father. Abramson argued that the father had been abusive. In 1990, Abramson won the acquittal of Dr. Khalid Parwez, \\"a Pakistani-born gynecologist accused of strangling and dismembering his 11-year-old son\\", presenting an alibi for Parwez, and arguing that Parwez's brother, who had returned to Pakistan, was the likely culprit. =The Menendez trial= Abramson gained national attention in the early 1990s, when she represented Erik Menendez in his trial for the murder of his parents, again presenting parental abuse as the defense for the crime alleged. She stirred controversy when it was revealed during the trial that she had Erik's psychiatrist delete and rewrite passages of the doctor's notes. When asked by the judge about it, she twice invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination, and later asserted that any discussions were protected by attorney-client privilege. As a result, an investigation was launched by the state bar. Following a three-year investigation, the state bar closed its case \\"after deciding that there was insufficient evidence to conclude she violated ethical rules in Menendez brothers' retrial.\\" =Post-Menendez career= In 1997, Abramson published a book, The Defense Is Ready: Life in the Trenches of Criminal Law. In 2004, she was hired by Phil Spector, who was charged with fatally shooting actress Lana Clarkson at his suburban Alhambra, California mansion, replacing his former attorney, Robert Shapiro. She resigned from representing Spector over conflicts between them; he went on to be convicted of murder, under different counsel. She is now retired but makes public appearances from time to time. In popular culture In 1993, while the trial was still ongoing, she was parodied on Saturday Night Live, where she was portrayed by Julia Sweeney, along with John Malkovich and Rob Schneider as Lyle and Erik Menendez. Sweeney portrayed Abramson again the following year as a talk show host defending the actions of Tonya Harding (played by Melanie Hutsell) and Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá (played by Patrick Stewart). In the 1994 television film Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills, Abramson is portrayed by Margaret Whitton. Actress Tracey Ullman revealed that her Tracey Takes On... character, Sydney Kross, was in part inspired by Abramson. In 2017, Edie Falco portrayed Abramson in the first season of Law & Order True Crime, based on the Menendez trial. Falco was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for the role. Personal life Abramson was married to a pharmacist whom she divorced in 1969, with whom she had a daughter, Laine. She married Los Angeles Times reporter Tim Rutten, and the couple adopted a son.

At the same time, 'the \\"Me\\" disciplines the \\"I\\" by holding it back from breaking the law of the community'.Greg Marc Nielson, The Norms of Answerability (2002) p. 135 It is thus very close to the way in a man Freud's 'ego-censor, the conscience...arose from the critical influence of his parents (conveyed to him by the medium of the voice), to whom were added, as time went on, those who trained and taught him and the innumerable and indefinable host of all the other people in his environment‚Äîhis fellow-men‚Äîand public opinion'.Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 92 and p. 90 It is 'the attitude of the other in one's own organism, as controlling the thing that he is going to do'.Charles W. Morris ed., George Herbert Mead, Mind, Self and Society, (Chicago 1967) p. 196 By contrast, 'the \\"I\\" is the response of the individual to the attitude of the community'.Mead, p. 196 The \\"I\\" acts creatively, though within the context of the me. Mead notes that \\"It is only after we have acted that we know what we have done...what we have said.\\" People, he argues, are not automatons; Mead states that \\"the \\"I\\" reacts to the self which arises though the taking of the attitude of others.\\" They do not blindly follow rules. They construct a response on the basis of what they have learned, the \\"me\\". Mead highlighted accordingly those values that attach particularly to the \\"I\\" rather than to the me, \\"...which cannot be calculated and which involve a reconstruction of the society, and so of the 'me' which belongs to that society.\\"Mead, p. 214 Taken together, the \\"I\\" and the \\"me\\" form the person or the self in Mead's social philosophy. According to Mead, there would be no possibility of personality without both the \\"I\\" and the \\"Me\\". Fusion Mead explored what he called 'the fusion of the \\"I\\" and the \\"me\\" in the attitudes of religion, patriotism, and team work', noting what he called the \\"peculiar sense of exaltation\\" that belongsMead, p. 273 to them. He also considered that 'the idea of the fusion of the \\"I\\" and the \\"me\\" gives a very adequate explanation of this exaltation...in the aesthetic experience'.Mead, p. 280 In everyday life, however, 'a complete fusion of the \\"I\\" and the \\"me\\" may not be a good thing...it is a dynamic sort of balance between the \\"I\\" and the \\"me\\" that is required'.Tejera, p. 62 Conventionality When there is a predominance of the \\"me\\" in the personality, 'we speak of a person as a conventional individual; his ideas are exactly the same as those of his neighbours; he is hardly more than a \\"me\\" under the circumstances'Mead, p. 200‚Äî\\"...the shallow, brittle, conformist kind of personality...\\" that is \\"all persona, with its excessive concern for what people think.\\"Anthony Stevens, On Jung (London 1990) p. 43 The alternative‚Äîand in many ways Mead's ideal‚Äîwas the person who has a definite personality, who replies to the organized attitude in a way that makes a significant difference. With such a person, the I is the most important phase of the experience. Dissociation Mead recognised that it is normal for an individual to have 'all sorts of selves answering to all sorts of different social reactions', but also that it was possible for 'a tendency to break up the personality' to appear: 'Two separate \\"me's\\" and \\"I's\\", two different selves, result...the phenomenon of dissociation of personality'.Mead, p. 143-4 Literary examples Walt Whitman 'marks off the impulsive \\"I\\", the natural, existential aspect of the self, from critical sanction.

Along with Colin McCahon and Toss Woollaston, she is credited as one of the leading figures in twentieth century New Zealand art. She worked primarily in oil and water colour, and is well known for her portraits and landscapes. Biography Henrietta Catherine Angus was born on 12 March 1908 in Hastings, the eldest of seven children of William McKenzie Angus and Ethel Violet Crabtree.Rita Angus at Artdeco.org. In 1921, her family moved to Palmerston North and she attended Palmerston North Girls' High School (1922‚Äì26). In 1927, she began studying at the Canterbury College School of Art. She never completed her diploma in fine arts but continued to study until 1933, including classes at the Elam School of Fine Arts in Auckland. During her studies she was introduced to renaissance and medieval art and received traditional training in life drawing, still life and landscape painting. Angus married Alfred Cook, a fellow artist, on 13 June 1930, but they separated in 1934, and divorced in 1939. Angus signed many of her paintings as Rita Cook between 1930 and 1946, but after she discovered in 1941 that Alfred Cook had remarried, she changed her surname by deed poll to McKenzie, her paternal grandmother's surname. As a result, some of her paintings are also signed R. Mackenzie or R. McKenzie, but the majority are signed Rita Angus. After a short period teaching art in Napier, Angus lived mostly in Christchurch during the 1930s and 1940s. In the late 1940s she suffered from mental illness and entered Sunnyside Mental Hospital in 1949. In 1950 she moved to Waikanae to convalesce, and then settled in Wellington in 1955. Death From December 1969, Angus' condition rapidly deteriorated; she died in Wellington Hospital of ovarian cancer on 25 January 1970, aged 61. Art Cass, which Angus made in 1936, has been called \\"one of the iconic images of 20th-century New Zealand painting\\". Among Angus' influences were Byzantine art and cubism. She was also influenced by the English painter Christopher Perkins' 1931 painting of Mount Taranaki, a response to New Zealand's distinctive clear lighting. Her landscapes came in a time when many people were concerned to create a distinctly New Zealand style, but Angus herself was not interested in defining a national style so much as her own style. Her paintings are clear, hard-edged and sharply-defined. In the 1930s and 1940s she painted scenes of Canterbury and Otago. One of the most famous of these is Cass (1936) in which she portrayed the bare emptiness of the Canterbury landscape using simplified forms and mostly unblended colours arranged in sections in a style remiscent of poster art. Cass was voted New Zealand's most-loved painting in a 2006 television poll. For a while, she lived next to the artist Leo Bensemann. Their adjacent flats became something of a hub of the local art scene and it is said that they spurred each other on in their art. It has been stated that Angus produced some of her finest pieces during this time including many portraits. Angus' pacifist beliefs can be seen in her art of the 1940s, when she avoided any kind of war work.https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/rita-angus/ Angus stated, \\"As an artist it is my work to create life and not to destroy it.\\" She created three goddess images symbolizing peace of which \\"Rutu\\" is the most well known. In the early 1950s Angus spent some time travelling around New Zealand. One of her trips was to Central Otago, where she painted her well-known piece Central Otago. In 1955 Angus moved to Wellington and from this time her landscapes focused on Wellington and the Hawke's Bay which she visited regularly. Boats, Island Bay is one such iconic Wellington painting. Angus painted a large number of portraits, including \\"Head of a Maori Boy\\" (1938) and \\"Portrait (Betty Curnow)\\" (1942). She was able to capture the personality of her subjects, moving beyond a mere representation of their form. Angus also painted 55 self-portraits, particularly during her later years when she became afflicted with increasingly serious bouts of narcissistic disorder. In 1958 Angus won a New Zealand Art Societies' Fellowship and travelled to London to study at the Chelsea School of Art and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. She also visited Scotland and Europe and studied modern and traditional European art. Angus devoted much of 1960 to the painting of a mural at Napier Girls' High School which can now be seen at the front of the school hall. The mural was commissioned to commemorate the girls who died in the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake.

Knopf in 1963. It won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. Portions of the novel first appeared in Esquire and The New Yorker. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1964\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-11. (With acceptance speech by Updike and essay by Harold Augenbraum from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) The French translation of the novel won the Prix du Meilleur Livre √âtranger (Best Foreign Book Prize). Plot summary The story concerns George Caldwell, a school teacher, and his son Peter, outside of Alton (i.e., Reading), Pennsylvania. The novel explores the relationship between the depressive Caldwell and his anxious son. George has largely given up on life; what glory he knew, as a football player and soldier in World War I, has passed. He feels put upon by the school's principal, and he views his students as hapless and uninterested in anything he has to teach them. Peter, meanwhile, is a budding aesthete who idolizes Vermeer and dreams of becoming a painter in a big city, like New York. He has no friends his age, and regularly worries that his peers might detect his psoriasis, which stains his skin and flecks his clothes every season but summer. One thing George and Peter share is the desire to get out, to escape their hometown. This masculine desire for escape appears in Updike's famed \\"Rabbit\\" novels. Similarly, the novel's image of Peter's mother alone on an untended farm is one we later see in Updike's 1965 novel Of the Farm. Themes Like James Joyce in Ulysses, Updike drew on the myths of antiquity in an attempt to turn a modern and common scene into something more profound, a meditation on life and man's relationship to nature and eternity. George is both the Centaur Chiron and Prometheus (some readers might see George's son Peter as Prometheus), Mr. Hummel, the automobile mechanic, is Hephaestus (AKA Vulcan); and so forth. The novel's structure is unusual; the narrative shifts from present day (late 1940s) to prospective (early 1960s), from describing the characters as George, Vera, and the rest, to the Centaur, Venus, and so forth. It also is punctuated with a feverish dream scene and George's obituary. Near the end of the novel, Updike includes two untranslated Greek sentences. Their translation is as follows: This quote is from Bibliotheca 2.5.4, and describes the death of Chiron.

It can be used on wounds such as cuts. 'Poultice' may also refer to a porous solid filled with solvent used to remove stains from porous stone such as marble or granite. The word \\"poultice\\" comes from the Greek word \\"poltos\\" transformed in the Latin puls, pultes, meaning \\"porridge\\".  Types  * Some Native Americans used mashed pumpkin or Devil‚Äôs club as a poultice.Roberts, Margaret. Edible & Medicinal Flowers. Cape Town, South Africa: New Africa Books, 2000. *Native Americans have thousands of plants for the making of poultices. The known tribes who utilize(d) plants for poultices include the Abnaki, Aleut, some Algonquin bands, Anticosti, some Apache tribes, Atsugewi, Bella Coola, Blackfoot, Cahuilla, California Indian, Carrier bands, Catawba, Chehalis, Cherokee, some Cheyenne, Chickasaw, Chippewa, Choctaw, Clallam, Coahuilla, some Cocopa, Comanche, Concow, and many more. * In addition to bread and cereals, bran may also be used as a poultice because of its absorbent quality. It is packed into the wound and then covered with a piece of sacking or similar material before being bandaged onto the site of the wound. * There are also many commercial poultices that are ready- made. Some of these may be labeled as \\"drawing salves\\". * Ash poultices can cause a chemical burn.Morritt AN, Bache SE, Ralston D, Stephenson AJ., Coal ash poultice: an unusual cause of a chemical burn., J Burn Care Res, 2009 Nov‚ÄìDec; 30(6):1046‚Äì1047.  Inflammation treatment  Linum usitatissimum) may be used in a poultice for boils, inflammation and wounds. A poultice is a proposed cooling product that is commonly used for show-jumpers and racehorses, as it is often cheaper and easier to administer than many other cooling products. Ice Tite is a poultice that is applied to the horse's distal limbs after exercise, for 9‚Äì12 hours. The intended effect of Ice Tite is to cool the horse's legs over a long period of time, by drawing heat out of the leg through evaporation. It is a common practice to bandage over the Ice Tite, using bandages and bandage fillers, and to place either wet newspaper or cellophane wrap between the Ice Tite and bandages, yet bandaging over the poultice may also prevent the action of heat evaporation and, therefore, prevent cooling‚Äîi.e., heat can't escape. It is also worth noting dry poultice stores heat. Poultices may also be heated and placed on an area where extra circulation is desired.

It is referred to in Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain works. It connected the Kamboja Kingdom in today's Afghanistan and Tajikistan via Pakistan to DvƒÅrakƒÅ (Dvaravati) and other major ports in Gujarat, India, permitting goods from Afghanistan and China to be exported by sea to southern India, Sri Lanka, the Middle East and Ancient Greece and Rome. The road was the second most important ancient caravan route linking India with the nations of the northwest. The route A horse caravan. The Kamboja‚ÄìDvƒÅrakƒÅ trade route began at the seaport of DvƒÅrakƒÅ. It passed through the Anarta region to Madhyamika, a city near Chittor. South of Aravalli, the road reached the Indus River, where it turned north. At Roruka (modern Rodi), the route split in two: one road turned east and followed the river Sarasvati to Hastinapura and Indraprastha, while the second branch continued north to join the main east- west road (the Uttarapatha Route across northern India from Pataliputra to Bamyan) at Pushkalavati.Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1966, p 122, Oriental philology.India, a Nation, 1983, p 77, Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala.Trade and Trade Routes in Ancient India, 1977, pp vii, 94 Dr Moti Chandra.Trade routes; Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh., 1999, p 537, Shyam Singh Shashi ‚Äì History).B.C.

From Pushkalavati, the Kamboja-DvƒÅrakƒÅ and Uttarapatha routes ran together to Bahlika through Kabul and Bamyan. At Bahlika, the road turned east to pass through the Pamir Mountains and Badakshan, finally connecting with the Silk Road to China.The Puranas, Vol V, No 2, July 1963; India, a Nation, 1983, p 76, Dr Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala. Land trade Both the historical record and archaeological evidence show that the ancient kingdoms in the northwest (GandhƒÅra and Kamboja) had economic and political relations with the western Indian kingdoms (Anarta and Saurashtra) since Ancient times. This commercial intercourse appears to have led to the adoption of similar sociopolitical institutions by both the Kambojas and the Saurashtras. =Historical records= References in both Hindu and Buddhist scriptures mention trading activities of the ancient Kambojas with other nations: * It is referred to in the Pali work called Petavatthu, wherein it is said that traders went with caravans with wagons loaded with goods from DvƒÅravati to Kamboja.Petavatthu, Pali Text Society edition p. 32: Yassa atthƒÅya gacchƒÅma, kamboja·πÉ dhanahƒÅrakƒÅ; ... YƒÅna·πÉ ƒÅropayitvƒÅna, khippa·πÉ gacchƒÅma dvƒÅrakan-ti. * The Arthashastra by Kautiliya, a treatise on statecraft written between the 4th century BCE and the 4th century CE, classifies the Kamboja and Saurashtra kingdoms as one entity, since the same form of politico-economic institutions existed in both republics. The text makes particular mention of warfare, cattle-based agriculture and trade.:Kamboja. Sauraastra.ksatriya.shreny.adayo vartta.shastra.upajivinah  11.1.04  . The description tallies with those in the B·πõhat Sa·πÉhitƒÅ, a 6th- century CE encyclopedia:Panchala Kalinga Shurasenah Kamboja Udra Kirata shastra varttah  5.35ab . and the major epic Mahabharata, which makes particular reference to the wealth of the Kambojas.:Kambojah.................yama vaishravan.opamah... MBH 7.23.42  i.e the Kambojas ferocious like Yama, the god of death (in war), and rich like Kubera, the god of wealth, in material wealth. =Archaeological evidence= Numerous precious objects discovered in excavations in Afghanistan, at Bamyan, Taxila and Begram, bear evidence to a close trade relationship between the region and ancient Phoenicia and Rome to the west and Sri Lanka to the south. Because archaeological digs in Gujarat have also found ancient ports, the Kamboja‚ÄìDvƒÅrakƒÅ Route is viewed as the logical corridor for those trade items that reached the sea before traveling on east and west.Ancient Ports of Gujarat, A.R. Dasgupta, Deputy Director, SIIPA, SAC, Ahmedabad, M. H. Raval Ex. Director, Directorate of Archaeology, Ahmedabad. The seaport and international trade Lapis lazuli. From the port of DvƒÅrakƒÅ at the terminus of the Kamboja‚ÄìDvƒÅrakƒÅ Route, traders connected with sea trading routes to exchange goods as far west as Rome and as far east as Kampuchea. Goods shipped at DvƒÅrakƒÅ also reached Greece, Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, southern India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, the land of Suwannaphum (whose location has still not been determined) and the Indochinese peninsula. DvƒÅrakƒÅ was, however, not the only port at the route's terminus. Perhaps more important was Barygaza or Bharukaccha (modern Bharuch, located on the mainland to the east of the Kathiawar peninsula on the river Narbada. Horse dealers from north-west Kamboja traded as far as Sri Lanka, and there may have been a trading community of them living in Anuradhapura, possibly along with some Greek traders.Epigraphia Zeylanica, by Don Martino, Vol II, No 13, pp 75- 76. This trade continued for centuries, long after the Kambhojans had converted to Islam in the 9th century CE.(Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, XV, p 171, E. Muller. The chief export products from Kamboja were horses, ponies, blankets embroidered with threads of gold, Kambu/Kambuka silver, zinc, mashapurni, asafoetida, somvalak or punga, walnuts, almonds, saffron, raisins and precious stones including lapis lazuli, green turquoise and emeralds. =Historical records: western sea trade= The sea trade from the southern end of the Kamboja‚ÄìDvƒÅrakƒÅ Route to the west is documented in Greek, Buddhist and Jain records: * The 1st-century CE Greek work The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions several seaports on the west coast of India, from Barbarikon at the mouth of the Indus to Bharakuccha, Sopara, Kalyan and Muziris. The Periplus also refers to Saurashtra as a seaboard of Arabia. *A century later, Ptolemy's The Geographia also refers to Bharakuccha port as a great commercial center situated on the Narbada estuary.Ptolemy's Geography, p 38. Ptolemy also refers to Saurashtra as Syrestrene. * The 7th-century CE Chinese traveler Yuan Chwang calls Saurashtra Sa-la-ch'a and refers to it as \\"the highway to the sea where all the inhabitants were traders by profession\\".Yuan Chwang, p 248 * Undated ancient Jain texts also refer to heavy trade activity in Saurashtran seaports, some of which had become the official residences of international traders.Life as depicted in Jain canons, p 273, Bombay, 1947, J. C. Jain; Geographical Data in Early Purana, 1972, p 321, Dr M. R. Singh. Bharakuccha in particular is described as donamukha, meaning where goods were exchanged freely. The Brhatkalpa describes the port of Sopara as a great commercial center and a residence of numerous traders.Brhatkalpa Bhashya, I, 2506. * Other ports mentioned in texts include Vallabhi (modern Vala), a flourishing seaport during the Maitraka dynasty in the 5th through 8th centuries CE. The existence of a port at Kamboi is attested in 10th-century CE recordsG. Buhler, Indian Antiquary, VI, 1877, pp 191‚Äì92 as Kamboika. The commerce of the western Indian coast was lucrative. Bharukacchan and Soparan traders who established settlements or trading posts in the Persian Gulf reaped enormous profits from the Indo-Roman trade and, according to the Vienna Papyrus, written in the mid-2nd century CE, paid high rates of interest.The Indian Ocean in Antiquity, p. 295, J. Reade; A Resurvey of Roman Contacts with the West, H. P. Ray, Ed. Baussac and Salles, p. 103. =Archaeological evidence: western sea trade= A Roman coin. There is good archaeological evidence of Roman trade goods in the first two centuries CE reaching Kamboja and Bactria through the Gujarati peninsula. Archaeologists have found frescoes, stucco decorations and statuary from ancient Phoenicia and Rome in Bamian, Begram and Taxila in Afghanistan.Peter T Blood, Lib of Congress, Federal Research Division, 1997. Goods from Rome on the trade route included frankincense, coral of various colors (particularly red), figured linen from Egypt, wines, decorated silver vessels, gum, stone, opaque glass and Greek or European slave?women. Roman gold coins were also traded and were usually melted into bullion in Afghanistan, although very little gold came from Rome after 70 CE. In exchange, ships bound for Rome and the west loaded up in Barbaricum/Bharukaccha with lapis lazuli from Badakshan, green turquoise from the Hindu Kush and Chinese silk (mentioned as reaching Barbaricum via Bactria in The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea).Rome Beyond the Imperial Frontiers, M. Wheeler, p. 156 =Historical records: eastern sea trade= The eastern and southern sea trade from the ports at the southern terminus of the Kamboja‚ÄìDvƒÅrakƒÅ Route is described in Buddhist, Jain and Sri Lankan documents. * Ancient Buddhist references attest that the nations from the northwest, including the Kamboja as well as the Gandhara, Kashmira, Sindhu and Sovira kingdoms were part of a trade loop with western Indian sea ports. Trade ships regularly plied between Bharukaccha, Sopara and other western Indian ports, and southern India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Suvannabhumi and the Indochinese peninsula.cf: All Gratitude To Myanmar, S.

The Pali work called Petavatthu says that traders went with caravans with wagons loaded with goods from DvƒÅravati to Kamboja. The Pali work ApadƒÅna refers to a saint named BƒÅhiya DƒÅrucƒ´riya who was born in the port of Bharakuccha and according to a commentary who made several trade voyages. He sailed the length of the Indus seven times, and also travelled across the sea as far as Suvannabhumi and returned safely home.Buddhist Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, Vol II, 1960, G. P. Malalasekera, sv. 'BƒÅhiya' Also, the 4th century CE Pali text Sihalavatthu refers to Kambojas being in the Province of Rohana on the island of Tambapanni, or Sri Lanka.Ships and the Development of Maritime Technology on the Indian Ocean, 2002, pp 108‚Äì109, David Parkin and Ruth Barnes. * An undated Jain text mentions a merchant sailing from Bharukaccha and arriving in Sri Lanka in the court of a king named Chandragupta.Early History of Education in Ceylon: from earliest times to Mahasena, 1969, p. 33, U. D. Jayasekara. * There is also a tradition in Sri Lanka, (recorded in the P≈´jƒÅvaliya) that Tapassu and Bhalluka, the two merchant brothers, natives of Pokkharavati (modern Pushkalavati) in what then was ancient Kamboja-Gandhara and now is the Northwest Frontier Province of Pakistan, \\"visited the east coast of Ceylon and built a Cetiya there.\\".See Bhallika, Bhalliya, Bhalluka Thera in: Online Buddhist Dictionary of Pali Proper Names. In addition, several ancient epigraphic inscriptions found in a cave in Anuradhapura refer to Kamboja corporations and a Grand Kamboja Sangha (community) in ancient Sinhala, as early as the 3rd century BC.Dr S. Parnavitana, Dr J. L. Kamboj and others; see talk page for Kambojas and for Migration of Kambojas. * Several Iranian records mention an embassy from a Sri Lankan king to the Iranian emperor Anusharwan (531‚Äì578). The Sri Lankan monarch is reported to have sent the Persian emperor ten elephants, two hundred thousand pieces of teakwood and seven pearl divers. =Archaeological evidence: eastern sea trade= Archaeological digs in Sri Lanka have turned up coins, beads and intaglios from Bactria and Afghanistan. A fragment of a Gandhara Buddha statue in schist was recently unearthed from the excavations at Jetavanaramaya in Anuradhapura. Other finds in Sri Lanka, such as lapis lazuli of the Badakshan type, connect that island with Kamboja, ancient source of the material. =Facts in the original Pali sources= According to Malalasekara, in the entry 'Kamboja' in Dictionary of Pali Proper Names: 'The country was evidently on one of the great caravan routes, and there was a road direct from DvƒÅraka to Kamboja (Pv.p. 23).'Buddhist Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, Vol I, 1960, G. P. Malalasekera, p 526 The Pali work called Petavatthu that Malalasekera refers to (as Pv.p. 23) says that caravan wagons loaded with goods went from DvƒÅraka to Kamboja.Petavatthu, Pali Text Society edition p. 32: Yassa atthƒÅya gacchƒÅma, kamboja·πÉ dhanahƒÅrakƒÅ; ... YƒÅna·πÉ ƒÅropayitvƒÅna, khippa·πÉ gacchƒÅma dvƒÅrakan-ti. The story and verses are translated in Stories of the Departed, pp. 45-54. The introductory story as given in the Petavatthu Commentary says that the thousand caravan carts that went from DvƒÅravatƒ´ to Kamboja passed through an arid desert where they got lost.Petavatthu-a·π≠·π≠hakathƒÅ, Pali Text Society edition p. 112.

Henry S. Gehman, in Minor Anthologies of the Pali Canon, volume IV, 1942, Pali Text Society, Bristol, pp. 45-54. With regards BƒÅhiya DƒÅrucƒ´riya, Malalasekara writes that he 'engaged himself in trade, voyaging in a ship. Seven times he sailed down the Indus and across the sea and returned safely home. On the eighth occasion, while on his way to Suva·πá·πáabh≈´mi, his ship was wrecked, and he floated ashore on a plank, reaching land near SuppƒÅraka.' The ApadƒÅna verses of BƒÅhiya say that he was born in the town of BhƒÅrukaccha ( modern Bharuch) and departed on a ship from there. After being on sea for a few days, he fell into the sea due to a frightful, horrible sea-monster (makara), but on a plank managed to reach the port of SuppƒÅraka.Apadana, Pali Text Society edition, II 476.

The source for Malalasekera's statement that BƒÅhiya sailed down the Indus and went to Suva·πá·πáabh≈´mi is the UdƒÅna Commentary of DhammapƒÅla, which says that BƒÅhiya was born in the country of BƒÅhiya, and was a merchant. Masefield translates the commentary as follows: 'He filled a ship with abundant goods, ... , for the purposes of trade, entered upon the ocean and, in successively roaming about, on seven occasions approached his own city via an expedition up the Indus. But on the eighth occasion, he embarked into his ship with his goods loaded on board thinking he would go to Suva·πá·πáabh≈´mi. Having ventured deep into the Great Ocean, the ship went off-course in the midst of the ocean, without reaching the desired destination, with the people (on board) becoming a meal for fish and turtles. But BƒÅhiya, being tossed about ever so slowly by the motion of the waves as he made his way (to safety) after grabbing hold of a ship‚Äôs plank, on the seventh day reached the shore in the locality of the port of SuppƒÅraka.'Translation Peter Masefield in UdƒÅna Commentary, Volume 1, 1994, PTS, Oxford, p. 118.

Through his investment in Fenway Sports Group, he is currently chairman of both Liverpool Football Club and the Boston Red Sox. Werner first became a part owner of the San Diego Padres in 1990, later was part of a group that purchased the Boston Red Sox, and has served as chairman of the Red Sox since February 27, 2002. Since then, the team has won four World Series‚Äîthe 2004 title ending an 86-year championship drought‚Äîand qualified for the postseason 10 times. In 2018, the Red Sox won a franchise- record 108 games and went on to win a ninth World Series title. Werner became chairman of Liverpool Football Club in 2010. In his time in office, Liverpool has won four trophies including the UEFA Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League in 2020 under manager J√ºrgen Klopp. As a television producer, Werner formed a partnering with producer Marcy Carsey to create Carsey-Werner. The company produced several shows including The Cosby Show, Roseanne, 3rd Rock From The Sun and That ‚Äò70s Show. Werner served as executive producer for the reboot of Roseanne and was the executive producer for The Conners.

He was educated at St. Bernard's School in Manhattan, The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut, and graduated from Harvard University in 1971. Television career In 1973, Werner entered television by working for ABC-TV. In 1975, he became the Director of East Coast Prime Time Development. Werner was promoted to senior vice president of the prime- time development department in 1979. While at ABC, Werner was involved in the development of Mork & Mindy, Bosom Buddies, Soap, and Taxi. Werner left the network in 1980 and co-founded The Carsey-Werner Company with Marcy Carsey the same year. In this capacity he served as executive producer of such television programs as The Cosby Show, A Different World, Roseanne, 3rd Rock from the Sun and That 70s Show, and Grounded for Life. In 1996, Werner was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. In 2000, Werner, Carsey, and longtime partner Caryn Mandabach joined Oprah Winfrey to start Oxygen, a 24-hour cable channel which catered to the lifestyle and entertainment interests of the \\"millennial woman\\". In 2007, NBC Universal purchased the network for $925 million, and in 2017 it was rebranded as a multiplatform site with a focus on true-crime programming for women. Sports =San Diego Padres= Werner‚Äôs entry into sports team ownership came when he and 14 other Southern California-based investors purchased the San Diego Padres from McDonald‚Äôs heiress Joan Kroc for US $75 million on June 14, 1990. As holder of the largest financial stake in the ballclub, he served as the team‚Äôs general managing partner. It was a difficult period economically in Major League Baseball, which was riven by the financial disparity between small- and large-market franchises and ultimately cancelled the 1994 World Series because of a work stoppage that carried into the following season. Werner was appointed to Major League Baseball‚Äôs Executive Council and was chairman of MLB‚Äôs television negotiating committee, where he was an early proponent of the wild-card format that was first implemented in 1995. Just under six weeks into his new ownership role, he attempted to cross-promote the team with one of his television series in between games of a twi-night doubleheader versus the Cincinnati Reds at Jack Murphy Stadium on July 25, 1990. He had invited Roseanne Barr, the eponymous star of one of his sitcoms, to perform The Star-Spangled Banner on an evening billed as Working Women's Night at the ballpark. She comically sang the national anthem with a loud, screechy voice. After finishing her rendition, she grabbed her crotch and spat at the ground in an attempt to parody baseball players. The publicity stunt was met with condemnation from baseball fans and sportswriters, some of whom called it either the \\"Barr-Mangled Banner\\" or the \\"Barr-Strangled Banner.\\"Distel, Dave. \\"Padres' Werner to Blame for Roseanne's 'Barr-Mangled Banner,'\\" Los Angeles Times, Saturday, July 28, 1990. The Padres missed capturing the National League (NL) West title by three games in 1989, a year prior to the start of Werner's tenure. Its 89-73 record was then the second best in franchise history. After a pair of winning seasons with third- place finishes in 1991 and 1992,San Diego Padres (team history & encyclopedia) - Baseball-Reference.com. the team fell precipitously into the NL West cellar at 61-101 in 1993, six games behind the expansion Colorado Rockies.1993 National League Team Statistics and Standings - Baseball-Reference.com. It was on its way to a second consecutive last-place finish at 47-70, but a players strike prematurely ended the 1994 campaign.Young, Geoff. \\"San Diego Padres' 1993 fire sale,\\" The Hardball Times, Friday, September 7, 2007. Critics at the time attributed this sudden free fall in the standings to cost-cutting measures ordered by Werner and his fellow investors. The so-called Fire Sale of 1993Center, Bill. \\"The ballpark chronicles: 35 seasons with the Padres- Chapter 5: 'Barr-Strangled Banner,'\\" The San Diego Union-Tribune, Thursday, September 25, 2003. began on August 31, 1992, when Craig Lefferts was traded to the Baltimore Orioles. In the offseason, Randy Myers and Benito Santiago were allowed to become free agents, Tony Fern√°ndez and Mike Maddux were dealt to the New York Mets and Jerald Clark was selected by the Rockies in the expansion draft.Kurkjian, Tim. \\"Penny Pinchin' Padres,\\" Sports Illustrated, March 29, 1993. Gary Sheffield was sent to the Marlins on June 24, 1993, Fred McGriff was shipped to the Atlanta Braves. Bruce Hurst and Greg Harris were moved to the Rockies on July 26. The trade of Darrin Jackson to the Toronto Blue Jays on March 30, 1993, resulted in a class action filed against the Padres. During the previous December, the team sent a letter to season-ticket holders assuring them that the maximum effort would be made to retain Jackson. Economic circumstances changed, however, after Jackson won a $2.1-million arbitration award in February. Refunds were offered to ticket holders involved in the lawsuit. Werner‚Äôs term as majority owner ended when John Moores acquired an 80% interest for $80 million on December 22, 1994. Werner retained a 10% share in the franchise until he sold it to Moores before the start of the 2007 season.Krasovic, Tom. \\"Padres Notebook: Greene says surgery only a last resort,\\" The San Diego Union-Tribune, Saturday, February 24, 2007. =The Boston Red Sox and Fenway Sports Group= Werner returned to baseball in 2001, part of a group that included former Orioles and Padres CEO Larry Lucchino and Florida Marlins owner John W. Henry which made a successful bid to purchase the Boston Red Sox. Their bid, which totaled $700 million (including $40 million in assumed debt) was accepted by MLB on December 20, 2001, with formal approval coming on Feb. 27, 2002. Henry served as principal owner, Werner was named chairman and Lucchino became club president and CEO, a collaboration that generated a historic level of success. The new ownership group had been the only prospective purchasers committed to saving Fenway Park, the team‚Äôs historic home, and after three years of making substantial improvements to the ballpark, the owners made a long-term commitment to remain in Fenway, leading to more than $400 million in improvements during the first 17 years of their tenure. After the ballclub spent the 2002 season under interim GM Mike Port, who replaced Dan Duquette, the new ownership group promoted 28-year-old Theo Epstein, making him the youngest GM in baseball history. The Red Sox lost the 2003 ALCS in seven games to the New York Yankees in Epstein‚Äôs first season, but under new manager Terry Francona overcame a three games to none deficit to the New York Yankees to win the 2004 ALCS, then defeated the St. Louis Cardinals for their first World Series title since 1918. World Series titles followed in 2007, 2013 and 2018. After leaving the Red Sox in 2011, Francona criticized Werner for his focus on TV ratings, quoting Werner in on 2010 meeting as saying: \\"We need to start winning in a more exciting fashion.\\" Francona also criticized Werner for exaggerating his role in Red Sox management: > Werner was constantly trying to assert his importance. When the Henry group > first purchased the Red Sox, Werner hired a public relations firm to get his > name in the local newspapers. When stories were written about Henry or the > Red Sox, he was known to call writers and ask, \\"Why didn't you mention me in > your story?\\" =Liverpool F.C.= In 2010, the ownership group of Henry, Lucchino, and Werner bought Premier League team Liverpool F.C. from lawyers acting on behalf of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the lenders to former owners George N. Gillett, Jr. and Tom Hicks. On November 25, 2010, Liverpool F.C. announced that Werner would be installed as chairman, replacing Martin Broughton, beginning December 1, 2010.\\"Werner replaces Broughton as Liverpool chairman\\". The Washington Post. 2010-11-25. Retrieved 2010-11-25. In May 2012, Werner made a controversial decision by sacking manager and club icon Kenny Dalglish citing the club's poor league results. This was regarded as a poor decision by football experts such as BBC's Alan Hansen given Dalglish's success in lifting the club from 4 points above the relegation zone to a League Cup win and an FA Cup Finals appearance in just over a season. Swansea City's former manager, Brendan Rodgers, filled Dalglish's boots helping Liverpool finish 2nd in the 2013-14 Premier League that also earned a spot in the UEFA Champions league after a 5 year absence. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18104266http://www.goal.com/en- gb/news/2896/premier-league/2012/05/16/3107213/dalglishs-demise-the-latest- misjudgement-in-fsgs-liverpool-reign-http://www.premierleague.com/en- gb/matchday/league-table.html Rodgers was sacked just over a year later after failing to qualify for the Champions League a second time, due partially to the sale of Luiz Suarez to F.C.

According to El Pa√≠s, co-owner John Henry didn't trust public opinion so he looked for a mathematical method very similar to Moneyball which turned out to be Cambridge physicist Ian Graham's mathematical model to select the coach and players essential for Liverpool to win the UEFA Champions League.https://en.as.com/en/2019/06/03/football/1559596265_282692.html In his first year in charge Klopp led the team to the Football League Cup Final and UEFA Europa League during the 2015-16 season. In 2017-18, despite the sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona mid-season, Liverpool reached the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final which was their first time in 11 years. In the 2018-19 season, Liverpool finished second to Manchester City in the Premier League race by one point, and went on to win the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final to claim their sixth title in the competition which was also the first trophy under Klopp's management.https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbusfield/2019/06/03/liverpool- european-champions-league-title-premier-league-manchester-city-vice- versa/#2c2560d35e8ahttps://en.as.com/en/2019/06/03/football/1559515671_694828.html?omnil=resrelart After the European Cup win, Klopp signed a contract extension to 2024.https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/377870-liverpool-fc- statement-jurgen-klopp-extends-contract- to-2024#:~:text=Liverpool%20Football%20Club%20are%20delighted,and%2Da%2Dhalf%20years.

Born in the village of Studenci, near the town of Imotski in what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, he became a member of the fascist Usta≈°e at a young age. When the Axis powers occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941, ≈†akiƒá, aged 19, joined the administration in Jasenovac. He became the camp's assistant commander the following year, and married Nada Luburiƒá, the half-sister of concentration camp commander Vjekoslav \\"Maks\\" Luburiƒá, in 1943. This marriage, as well as his fanatic support for Usta≈°e leader Ante Paveliƒá, led to ≈†akiƒá's appointment as commander of Jasenovac in April 1944. He was charged in the deaths of an estimated 2,000 people who died during his six months of command at the concentration camp. In 1945, ≈†akiƒá and his wife fled the Independent State of Croatia alongside other Usta≈°e officials following the collapse of the NDH and Nazi Germany. They emigrated to Argentina in 1947, where ≈†akiƒá started a textile business, was an active member of the country's 10,000-strong Croat community, and became friends with Paraguayan dictator Alfredo Stroessner. He lived an otherwise quiet life and made no effort to hide his identity. In 1990, the Feral Tribune interviewed ≈†akiƒá for a magazine article and published his picture. ≈†akiƒá met Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman at a reception in Buenos Aires during the latter's visit to Argentina in 1994 and was interviewed by a Croatian publication called Magazin soon afterwards. He stated in the interview that he wished more Serbs had been killed in Jasenovac, saying that he would \\"do it all again\\" and added that he \\"slept like a baby\\". In March 1998, ≈†akiƒá was interviewed by Argentine national television. He admitted to having been in a leadership position at Jasenovac but denied that anyone had been killed there during this time, claiming that all of those who perished had died from disease. The interview was broadcast across the nation the following month. It caused an uproar and caused Argentine president Carlos Menem to call for ≈†akiƒá's arrest. ≈†akiƒá disappeared soon after and was not arrested until May 1998. He was extradited to Croatia, where he was tried, found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in October 1998 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He called the charges politically motivated and described himself as a Croatian patriot who only wanted to defend his country. ≈†akiƒá was imprisoned in Lepoglava prison and kept in a cell equipped with a television set and a computer for him to write his memoirs. He was allowed to visit his wife, who had been placed in a home for the elderly, several times a month. He died of heart problems in a Zagreb hospital on 20 July 2008 and was later cremated in full Usta≈°e uniform, as per his wishes. He was survived by his wife and three children. Early life Voice of America pronunciation of Dinko ≈†akiƒá Dinko Ljubomir ≈†akiƒá was born in the village of Studenci, near the town of Imotski in what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on 8 September 1921. He finished his education at the high school level. He became a committed member of the Croatian fascist movement known as the Usta≈°e at a very young age. Jasenovac In April 1941, Axis forces invaded and occupied Yugoslavia. The country was dismembered, with the extreme Croatian nationalist and fascist Ante Paveliƒá, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini's Italy, being appointed Poglavnik (leader) of an Usta≈°e-led Croatian state ‚Äì the Independent State of Croatia (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an \\"Italian-German quasi-protectorate.\\" NDH authorities, led by the Usta≈°e militia, subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani population living within the borders of the new state. ≈†akiƒá joined the administration of the Jasenovac concentration camp in 1941. The following year he was appointed its assistant commander. Here, he became the prot√©g√© of concentration camp commander Vjekoslav \\"Maks\\" Luburiƒá. According to eyewitness testimony, ≈†akiƒá murdered Croatian poet Mihovil Pavlek Mi≈°kina in June 1942. That summer, ≈†akiƒá is alleged to have personally directed an exhaust pipe into a van filled with women and children at the Stara Gradi≈°ka concentration camp, killing all those inside. In 1943 ≈†akiƒá married Nada, Maks Luburiƒá's half- sister who began working at Jasenovac at age 16. ≈†akiƒá became the commander of the Jasenovac concentration camp at the age of twenty-two in April 1944, his rapid rise through the ranks of the Usta≈°e coming partly as a result of his fanatic support for Paveliƒá's regime and partly due to his marriage to Nada. Jasenovac survivor ≈†imo Klaiƒá recalled: \\"≈†akiƒá was very young for such an important position. He was arrogant and always impeccably dressed in polished black leather boots and a tailored black Usta≈°e uniform. We were emaciated, in rags and sick. He would stride past us looking as if he had stepped out of a fashion magazine\\". In June 1944, ≈†akiƒá ordered reprisals be carried out against prisoners following the escape of an inmate named Ivan Wollner, who was captured in Hrvatska Dubica and beaten to death by the Usta≈°e soon after his escape. ≈†akiƒá personally selected twenty-five Jewish inmates from a group of 100 prisoners who had lived in the same barracks as Wollner. These were taken to a building called the \\"Zvonara\\", where they were put in solitary confinement, starved and tortured. ≈†akiƒá took part in the torture of Remzija Rebac, who, along with Milo Bo≈°koviƒá, led a group of twenty internees who organized an uprising and stole corn. Rebac was tortured with a flamethrower. ≈†akiƒá ordered the group executed by hanging during a camp \\"public performance\\" on 21 September 1944. Facing death, Bo≈°koviƒá asked to be shot in the head instead of being hanged. ≈†akiƒá agreed and, prior to shooting him, is reported to have said that he valued Bo≈°koviƒá \\"as a man and expert and that he should feel honoured to have the camp's commander personally kill him\\". ≈†akiƒá ordered the hanging of Marin Jurcev, manager of the infirmary in Jasenovac, who aided an Usta≈°e defector in smuggling information about the camp to the Yugoslav Partisans. Jurcev, his wife, and three internees held in the village of Jasenovac were executed. Jurcev's wife had to be pulled to the scaffold by her hair since she fell off three times. ≈†akiƒá sat and ate red beets and fried schnitzel while watching the hanged bodies with Croatian Interior Minister Andrija Artukoviƒá. ≈†akiƒá is reported to have personally taken part in killing and torturing inmates. Eyewitnesses stated that he shot prisoners numerous times, often killing for sport those who were sent to work in the fields surrounding Jasenovac. Ostensibly seeking to prevent the spread of typhoid, malaria and diphtheria, ≈†akiƒá detained inmates whom he deemed to be unhealthy ‚Äì ordering that they be killed inside a house that he called \\"the hospital\\". On another occasion, ≈†akiƒá ordered two or three dozen inmates to be locked inside a room until they died from thirst and starvation. In the fall of 1944, an American bomber crashed near the camp after conducting a raid over Hungary. Three airmen parachuted from it and landed by the Sava River. ≈†akiƒá had the three captured, beaten and paraded through Jasenovac. The men were tortured for three days before ≈†akiƒá ordered that they be bayoneted to death and their bodies dumped in a mass grave. During ≈†akiƒá's tenure in charge of Jasenovac, at least 2,000 inmates were killed. Many others died due to malnutrition or disease. Exile With the end of the war, ≈†akiƒá fled Croatia, alongside Paveliƒá and other Usta≈°e leaders, to Argentina. They were welcomed by Argentine leader Juan Per√≥n. ≈†akiƒá and his wife first found refuge in Francoist Spain, before settling in Argentina in 1947. ≈†akiƒá's wife changed her name to Esperanza. The two settled in the coastal town of Santa Teresita, 200 miles southeast of Buenos Aires, where ≈†akiƒá ran a textile business and was an active member of the country's 10,000-strong Croat community. ≈†akiƒá and his wife had three children, and arranged for Paveliƒá to be their godfather. In 1956, the ≈†akiƒá family fled Argentina following the fall of Per√≥n's government. They went back to Spain before returning to Argentina three years later. ≈†akiƒá was a friend of Paraguayan dictator Alfredo Stroessner, for whom he operated a \\"rest camp\\" for Croatian fascists in Paraguay. He lived an otherwise quiet life and engaged in Usta≈°e √©migr√© politics. He did not hide his identity and did not make an effort to change his name, however he lived in a small village called Santa Teresita, Buenos Aires. In 1990, the Feral Tribune interviewed ≈†akiƒá for a magazine article and published his picture. The interview saw ≈†akiƒá admonish the Serbs and praise the Usta≈°e. Later that year, he attended what the Chicago Tribune termed a \\"reunion of former Nazis\\" in Austria. ≈†akiƒá met Croatian leader Franjo Tuƒëman at a reception in Buenos Aires during the latter's visit to Argentina in 1994. Afterwards, ≈†akiƒá was interviewed by a Croatian publication called Magazin. He stated in the interview that he wished more Serbs had been killed in Jasenovac, saying that he would \\"do it all again\\". He added that he \\"slept like a baby\\". In March 1998, ≈†akiƒá was interviewed by Argentine national television. The full interview was broadcast on El Trece on 6 April. In it, ≈†akiƒá admitted to being in a leadership position at Jasenovac from December 1942 to October 1944 but denied that anyone had been killed during this time. He said: \\"When I was there no guard or administrator was allowed to so much as touch a prisoner. I'm not speaking about what it was like before or afterward, but when I was there no one could touch anyone\\". ≈†akiƒá claimed all the deaths that occurred during his command came as a result of natural causes. The interview caused a public uproar, with Argentine president Carlos Menem calling for ≈†akiƒá's arrest a day after the broadcast. ≈†akiƒá disappeared soon afterwards. His wife claimed that he had left to seek refuge in the Croatian Embassy in Buenos Aires, which the embassy denied. She stated that her husband had not committed acts of genocide in Jasenovac, saying: \\"It's such a huge lie. I am distraught. After fifty years, they come up with an atrocious thing like this\\". Dinko ≈†akiƒá was arrested on 1 May. Trial and imprisonment The Lepoglava prison, where ≈†akiƒá served his sentence. ≈†akiƒá was one of the most important figures from World War II who was still alive at the time of his trial. He was the last known living commander of a World War II concentration camp. ≈†akiƒá defended himself by claiming that Jasenovac was a Serb-Communist myth which was \\"created to destroy Croats\\". He showed no remorse and stated that Jasenovac was not an extermination camp but a work camp designed to hold the enemies of the NDH, whom he claimed were treated in a kind and benevolent manner. He claimed that no killings had occurred during his command. He maintained that the camp was organized to hold those complicit in the \\"Serbian genocidal policies\\" that he claimed were implemented against the Croats from 1919 until 1941. ≈†akiƒá stated that his conscience was clear before God and that he would do what he had done in Jasenovac again if the \\"biological existence\\" of Croats were threatened once more. He acknowledged that Jews and Romanis were detained because of their ethnicity but claimed Serbs and others were held as enemies of the state who wanted to destroy Croatia. > I am proud of what I did and would do it again.

He claimed the establishment of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars were evidence of Serbs having planned and carried out a genocide against Croats. ≈†akiƒá called the proceedings politically motivated and described himself as a Croatian patriot who only wanted to defend his country. He said Croatia had come under international pressure during its World War II history. The ensuing trial saw more than forty witnesses testify against ≈†akiƒá. His defence lawyers asked that he be acquitted; they claimed that the prosecution had failed to prove his guilt and stated that ≈†akiƒá was merely obeying orders while serving at the camp. On 4 October 1998, ≈†akiƒá was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to twenty years in prison. ≈†akiƒá applauded mockingly as the guilty verdict was read out to him. The presiding judge confirmed that ≈†akiƒá had personally shot prisoners and had overseen the hanging of at least twenty inmates. He pointed out that at least four witnesses testified to having seen ≈†akiƒá empty his pistol into the head of Milo Bo≈°koviƒá in September 1944. ≈†akiƒá served his sentence in Lepoglava prison. His cell came equipped with a television set and a computer for him to write his memoirs. He was allowed to visit his wife, who had been placed in a home for the elderly, several times a month. Death ≈†akiƒá suffered from heart problems throughout his imprisonment and spent most of his later years in hospital. He died of heart problems in a Zagreb hospital on 20 July 2008 and was cremated in full Usta≈°e uniform, as per his wishes. He was survived by his wife and three children. The priest who celebrated the funeral Mass, Vjekoslav Lasiƒá, stated that \\"the court that convicted Dinko ≈†akiƒá convicted Croatia and the Croatian nation\\". He claimed that \\"the NDH is the foundation of the modern Croatian homeland\\" and eulogized ≈†akiƒá by saying that \\"every honorable Croat should be proud of [his] name\\". ≈†akiƒá's funeral was attended by several Croatian politicians, including Anto Kovaƒçeviƒá.

BarCamp is an international network of user-generated conferences primarily focused around technology and the web. They are open, participatory workshop-events, the content of which is provided by participants. The first BarCamps focused on early-stage web applications, and were related to open source technologies, social software, and open data formats. The format has also been used for a variety of other topics, including public transit, health care, education, and political organizing. The BarCamp format has also been adapted for specific industries like banking, education, real estate and social media. History Five of the six originators of BarCamp: Tantek √áelik, Chris Messina, Ryan King, Andy Smith (termie), and Matt Mullenweg. Aung San Suu Kyi gives speech during BarCamp Yangon 2012 The name BarCamp is a playful allusion to the event's origins, with reference to the programmer slang term, foobar: BarCamp arose as an open- to-the-public alternative to Foo Camp, which is an annual invitation-only participant-driven conference hosted by Tim O'Reilly. The first BarCamp was held in Palo Alto, California, from August 19‚Äì21, 2005, in the offices of Socialtext. It was organized in less than one week,Tantek.com from concept to event, with 200 attendees. Since then, BarCamps have been held in over 350 cities around the world, in North America, South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Australasia and Asia. Attendees have often travelled internationally to attend BarCamps. To mark the first anniversary of BarCamp, BarCampEarthBarcamp.org was held in multiple locations worldwide on August 25‚Äì27, 2006. The second anniversary of BarCamp, BarCampBlock,Barcamp.org was held in Palo Alto at the original location, but also over a three block radius on August 18‚Äì19, 2007, and was attended by over 800 people. The largest recorded BarCamp took place in January 2013 with over 6400 confirmed registered attendees in Yangon, Myanmar (Burma). The January 2010 BarCamp Yangon attracted over 4700 attendees (confirmed with registration forms). Influence BarCamp makes their organizational process freely available, codifying it in a publicly available wiki. In addition to the BarCamp-branded network, it is also a model for user-generated conferences in other fields and for more specialized applications such as EdCamp, IndieWebCamp, WordCamp, crisis camps, and SkeptiCamp. Structure and participatory process Unlike traditional conference formats, both BarCamps and FooCamps have a self- organizing character, relying on the passion and the responsibility of the participants. Attendees schedule sessions by writing on a whiteboard or putting a Post-It note on a 'grid' of sessions. Those giving sessions are discouraged from using the sessions for promotion. BarCamps are often organized largely through the web; anyone can initiate a BarCamp using the BarCamp wiki.Barcamp.org Students taking part in a BarCamp at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore, in February 2009 Although the format is loosely structured, there are rulesBarcamp.org at BarCamp. All attendees are encouraged to present or facilitate a session or otherwise contribute to the event. Everyone is also asked to share information and experiences of the event via public web channels, including blogs, photo sharing, social bookmarking, Twitter, wikis, and IRC. This encouragement to share is a deliberate change from the \\"off-the-record by default\\" and \\"no recordings\\" rules at many invite-only participant driven conferences. It also turns a physical, face-to-face event into a 'hybrid event' which enables remote online engagement with BarCamp participants. Hosting and attending Venues typically provide basic services. Free network access, usually WiFi, is crucial. Following the model of Foo Camp, the venue also makes space for the attendees, or BarCampers, to literally camp out overnight. Thus, BarCamps rely on securing sponsorship, ranging from the venue and network access to beverages and food. Attendance is typically free of charge and generally restricted only by space constraints. Participants are typically encouraged to sign up in advance. Historical precedents Historically, Bar Camp was based on the structure of Foo Camp, but with the requirement that participation should be open to all. (Foo Camp, an early unconference, was organized by Tim O'Reilly and Sara Winge; Winge had been a student of Harrison Owen.BarCamp Mail Archive This form of self-organized user generated conferences is also related to hackers' meetings in Europe, especially those nearer to anarchism and autonomism, happening since the '90s in Temporary Autonomous Zones or other occupied places. However, BarCamps lack the political motivations and are actually quite integrated with the mainstream ICT industry, often getting substantial sponsorships from major corporations.

Guardian.co.uk, Roger Protz, Arts that others don't reach..., The Observer, Sunday February 11, 2001. Retrieved 31 August 2008 Smaller breweries in Denmark suffered greatly under the Carlsberg market dominance, especially during the middle of the 20th century, and this led to a large reduction in available beer quality and styles. In recent years the interest in higher quality beer has risen sharply, and the Danish beer landscape is now dotted with several small breweries and brewpubs, producing a wide range of beers.  Common types of beer  = Classic = An all malt pale lager with more colour and taste. The classic type is named after the Tuborg or the Carlsberg. Different bottles of Danish julebryg A bottle of hvidt√∏l Tuborg advertisement from 1900, known as \\"The Thirsty Man.\\" = Guld = Guld (Gold) is a name commonly applied to pale lagers with a strength around 5.7% abv. Examples include: Tuborg Guld (5.8%), Carlsberg Sort Guld (5.8%), Harboe Premium Gold (5.9%), Svaneke M√∏rk Guld (5.7%) and Wiibroe Guld Export (5.7%) usually referred to as Wiibroe Flag due to the many small Danish flags on the label. = Hvidt√∏l = Hvidt√∏l (White-beer) is a traditional Danish beer. It is usually under 2% abv, and quite malty and sweet. It was once the most common beer in Denmark but sales have declined so that it is mainly only bought at Christmas when it is served with risalamande. The beer was originally termed \\"white\\" as it was made from kilned malt, which was developed in the late 18th century in contrast to the malts dried over fires which produced smokey beers.The Beer of the Danish Golden Age , Rolf Nielson, Scandinavian Brewers Review, Vol 65, No 4, 2008, pp 12 ‚Äì 21. = Julebryg = Julebryg and Jule√∏l (Christmas beer) are names given to beers marketed at Christmas. They vary in strength and style, though tend to be malty and around 6% abv. Examples include Tuborg Julebryg (a 5.6% pale lager), Svaneke Julebryg (a 5.6% dark lager), Fur Julebryg (a 6.5% brown ale), Fjordens Jule√∏l (a 6% dark lager), and Raasted Jule√∏l (an 8.5% dark ale). Also Carlsberg 47 is slightly connected to the late autumn and Christmas. = Nisse√∏l = Nisse√∏l (literally nisse beer) is a dark, sweet hvidt√∏l (white beer, see above) which is sold around Christmas time in Denmark. It is not to be confused with julebryg, which is a much stronger Danish Christmas beer. = P√•ske√∏l = P√•ske√∏l (Easter beer) was the original seasonal beer, today the Christmas beers are more popular, but many Easter beers still remain. The Easter beer is a Danish tradition, a Danish traditionally. Like Christmas beers they are usually 5-6-7% lagers. Examples include: Carl's P√•ske, Tuborg P√•skebryg, Royal Spring, P√•skebryg 7,8% (√òrb√¶k Brewery), Fynsk For√•r (√òrb√¶k Brewery). = Pale lager = The most common type of beer in Denmark is pale lager, simply known as Pilsner in Danish. For instance: Carlsberg Pilsner (often called \\"Hof\\" in Denmark), Gr√∏n Tuborg, Tuborg klassisk (Tuborg Klassik), or Tuborg classic (Tuborg classic), Royal Pilsner. These pilsners have a moderate alcohol strength of 4,6% (by volume). A bit stronger pale lager (Pilsner) is the Guld (Gold) described above. Even stronger pale lagers are for instance Carlsberg Elephant (7.2%) and Tuborg Fine Festival (7.5%). = Strong Lager = Strong Lager (St√¶rk √òl or Export) refers to pale lagers in the tax category III (6-8%) beers such as Carlsberg Elephant Beer, Tuborg Fine Festival, Albani Giraffe, Royal Selection. = Brown Ales = Brown Ale is a common style, with Jacobsen being brewed by Carlsberg and √òrb√¶k Brewery, Skagen Bryghus. = Stouts and Porters = Many microbreweries brew stouts and porters. Such styles have been popular in the region, historically including Baltic porter. = IPA = India Pale Ales are also produced by many Danish microbreweries.

His work, along with that of fellow Briton Fred Vine and Canadian Lawrence Morley, showed how variations in the magnetic properties of rocks forming the ocean floor could be consistent with, and ultimately help confirm, Harry Hammond Hess's 1962 theory of seafloor spreading. In 1989 he was awarded the Geological Society of London's highest honour, the Wollaston Medal. Early life During World War II he went to school at The Downs in Malvern, and then Bryanston School in Dorset. He became head boy at both. Career Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift had never gained much scientific support due to its lack of any satisfactory mechanism to drive the process. During the 1950s, however, extensive surveys of the ocean floor revealed a global, linked system of mid-ocean ridges, all of which exhibited high thermal flow and considerable seismic activity. Hess hypothesized that new ocean crust was being formed at the ocean ridges by extrusions of magma from the Earth's mantle, and that convection currents within the mantle were continuously carrying the newly formed crust away from the ridge, widening the ocean basin and pushing the continents apart. In 1962 Matthews, as a research fellow at King's College, Cambridge, made a survey across part of an ocean ridge in the north-west Indian Ocean. This revealed a pattern of magnetic anomalies running in parallel stripes and virtually symmetrically on either side of the ridge. The most plausible explanation for these anomalies required the assumption (already in circulation at the time, but not yet proven) that the Earth's magnetic field had reversed its polarity repeatedly over time. Ocean crust consists of basic igneous rock, containing significant amounts of magnetite. When such rock solidifies, the magnetite aligns itself with the prevailing magnetic field at the time, thus providing a sort of \\"fossil\\" magnetic record. If new crust were being formed at the ridges and moving away, as Hess theorized, then reversals in the Earth's magnetic polarity would result in just the kind of parallel, symmetrical anomalies that Matthews' survey had found. The ocean crust would in effect act as a kind of giant tape recorder of magnetic anomalies over time. Matthews and his research student, Fred Vine, published these ideas in the article \\"Magnetic Anomalies over Ocean Ridges\\" in the magazine Nature in 1963. From then on, rapid progress was made both in terms of acceptance of Hess's theory and of further verification. Subsequent surveys of other ocean ridges showed similar and correlatable anomalies in every case. Confirmation of the Earth's polarity reversals a few years later not only further validated the Matthews-Vine hypothesis but provided a timescale allowing the rate of spreading to be estimated for each section of ocean ridge. The contribution of Matthews and Vine proved to be an essential element in the development and acceptance of plate tectonics theory. In 1977 he won the Chree medal and prize. In 1982 Matthews became the first scientific director of the British Institutions Reflection Profiling Syndicate (BIRPS), which had been established in 1981 to carry out deep seismic reflection profiling around the United Kingdom Continental Shelf.

He developed an affinity for art at an early age. He and his siblings were all given art lessons. His father was keen to see that they were independent. As a teenager Nasmyth lost the use of his right hand following an accident, forcing him to learn how to paint with his left. He also lost most of his hearing through illness. Much of Nasmyth's work, a great deal of which is undated, depicts his native Scotland, which he continued to paint even after moving to London in 1810. Like his father, he was heavily influenced by the Dutch masters of the 17th century, particularly Meindert Hobbema and Jacob van Ruysdael (a large number of works by both men were displayed in London galleries during Nasmyth's lifetime). Nasmyth died of pneumonia-like symptoms, which he contracted shortly after painting a scene just outside London. References *Irwin, David & Francina (1975).

He was a Lord of the Admiralty from 1761 to 1763 and was sworn of the Privy Council on 11 July 1765 and served as Vice-Chamberlain from 1765 to 1769. On his elevation to the peerage in 1769, he was made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to George III (1769‚Äì1777) and served as Master of the Buckhounds (1782‚Äì1783) and in other court posts until 1800. Because of his courtly manners was called the \\"Prince of Maccaronies.\\" He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1787. Family Lord Jersey married Frances Twysden at her stepfather's house in the parish of St Martin- in-the-Fields on 26 March 1770. Lady Jersey, who was seventeen years younger than her husband, became one of the more notorious mistresses of George IV in 1793, when he was still Prince of Wales. She was 40 years' old at the time and more than once a grandmother. Lord and Lady Jersey had ten children: *Lady Charlotte Anne Villiers (1771‚Äì1808), married Lord William Russell in 1789, and had issue. *Lady Anne Barbara Frances Villiers (1772‚Äì1832), married William Henry Lambton and had issue, including John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham; married secondly Hon.

Livingston Manor, New York, is a hamlet in Sullivan County. The Livingston Manor Historic District is located in Highland Park, New Jersey. Livingston Manor was a 160,000 acre () tract of land granted, in present-day New York and New Jersey, to Robert Livingston the Elder during the reign of George I of Great Britain. History Map of Livingston Manor in 1777Map of Livingston Manor and Rensselaerwyck in 1777 Livingston Manor was a 160,000 acre () tract of land granted to Robert Livingston the Elder through the influence of 5th Governor Thomas Dongan, and confirmed by royal charter of George I of Great Britain in 1715, creating the manor and lordship of Livingston. The original patent was obtained in July 1686. This tract embraced a large portion of what is now Columbia County. The lords of the manor were: *Robert Livingston the Elder (1654‚Äì1728), served from 1715‚Äì1728. *Philip Livingston (1686‚Äì1749), served from 1728‚Äì1749. *Robert Livingston (1708‚Äì1790), served from 1749‚Äì1790. Although an English-deeded tract, some sources list Livingston Manor with the patroonships of New Netherland. =Division of land= The first division of the estate occurred in 1728 upon the death of Robert Livingston the Elder, who stipulated that his third son, Robert Livingston (1718‚Äì1775), be granted 13,000 acres () from Livingston Manor's southwest corner, a tract which Robert christened Clermont Manor. In 1790, upon the death of the last lord of the manor, Robert Livingston, the remainder of Livingston Manor was divided among his heirs, rather than continue to pass down through primogeniture, as Robert disapproved of his eldest son, who had made many unwise financial decisions and was perennially in debt. The inheritors of the estate were all men who had distinguished themselves considerably during and after the American Revolution: *Philip Livingston (1716‚Äì1778), delegate to the Continental Congress and signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence *William Livingston (1723‚Äì1790), 1st Governor of New Jersey and signatory of the United States Constitution *William Alexander (1726‚Äì1783), major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War *James Duane (1733‚Äì1797), delegate to the Continental Congress, 44th Mayor of New York City, and signatory of the Articles of Confederation These four heirs subsequently divided the land among their own families, and the power of the Livingston family was slowly diminished. A portion of the estate is still held by the family. The town of Livingston, New York occupies part of the original tract. =Present day= The original Livingston Manor encompasses the present day towns of Livingston, Germantown, Clermont, Taghkanic, Gallatin, Copake, and Ancram, located in Columbia County New York. Other Livingston Manors =Livingston Manor, New York= Livingston Manor, in present-day Sullivan County in New York State, capitalizes on the Livingston Manor name because Manor family members and descendants had a house there however it was not part of the original manor The Sullivan County community, which is about west of the original manor, was part of the Hardenbergh patent in 1716 which included much of the Catskill Mountains. In 1750, Robert Livingston, the third lord, bought in the area shortly after becoming the third (and final) Lord of the Manor of Livingston Manor. Most of the land would be sold or leased by 1780. Robert's third son John Robert Livingston (1775‚Äì1851)Ulster.net deeded to his nephew Dr. Edward R. Livingston in 1822 around area then called Purvis, New York. In 1882, Purvis was renamed Livingston Manor.LivingstonManor.net Edward's \\"manor,\\" which was actually just a house, was on the site of the present village firehouse, according to a modern sign in the village,LivingstoneManor.net however other speculation says the house was on the location of the village Town Hall.LivingstoneManor.net =Livingston Manor, New Jersey= The Reverend John Henry Livingston, a member of the Livingston family, was chosen head of Queen's College (now Rutgers University) and in 1809 purchased a plot of land nearby Raritan Landing, which would thereafter be known as the Livingston Manor. A Greek Revival mansion built by descendants Robert and Louisa Livingston around 1843 stands on the property and is now known as Livingston Homestead. At the turn of the 20th century, the property was developed as a streetcar suburb, and in 2004 became part of the Livingston Manor Historic District.Spies, Stacy.

Oquaye was sworn in as the Speaker of Parliament on 7 January 2017. Family background and education Oquaye was born in Osu, Accra to E. G. N Oquaye of Osu and Felicia Awusika Abla Oquaye (n√©e Azu) of Odumase-Krobo. He was brought up at Asamankese in the Eastern Region, where he attended the Roman Catholic Primary School and Presbyterian Middle School before proceeding to Presbyterian Boys' Secondary (PRESEC), at Odumase-Krobo. Oquaye's father, E.G.N. Oquaye, had been a founding member of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) at Asamankese. He was also treasurer and principal financier of the UGCC, Gold Coast Party (GCP), National Liberation Movement (NLM) and United Party (UP) at Asamankese. When Oquaye was a child, his family received political figures and dignitaries such as Dr. J. B. Danquah and Prof. Kofi Abrefa Busia as guests at their home. While the Okyenhene, Nana Ofori Atta II, was in exile in Accra, he was also a regular visitor to the Oquaye family home in Asamankese. Oquaye is a Baptist Minister, and is married to Alberta Oquaye (n√©e Asafu-Adjaye), a professional nurse. Legal career He attended the Presbyterian Boys' Senior Secondary School for his GCE \\"O\\" Level Certificate and Apam Secondary School for his \\"A\\" Level Certificates. He entered the University of Ghana and later the University of London, at Lincoln's Inn, London. He holds B.A. (Hons.) Political Science, L.L.B. (Hons.), B.L. and PhD. He is a qualified solicitor and barrister, as well as the founder and senior partner of his own law firm. He is a barrister of the Supreme Court of England and Wales, a senior member of the Ghana Bar Association, and a solicitor for some leading companies and financial institutions. Academic career He is a professor of Political science at the University of Ghana, (Legon), and was previously the Head of the Department of Political Science and member of the University's Academic Board, the highest authority at the level of the faculties. He received his Ph.D from School of Oriental and African Studies in London, as well as winning the Rockefeller Senior Scholar Award in 1993 and the Senior Fulbright Scholar Award in 1997. He has been a visiting lecturer at George Mason University in Virginia. From 1997 to 1999, he was Vice-President of the African Association of Political Science (AAPS), based in Zimbabwe. Writings and advocacy Oquaye is a writer, who has researched and written extensively on good governance, conflicts, political education, decentralization and development, human rights, military intervention in politics, NGOs, rural development and gender issues. He advocates women's rights, including affirmative action. He is the author of the award-winning book Politics in Ghana - 1972-1979, in which he depicts, inter-alia, the military as the bane of Government and Politics in Africa and recounted instances of human right abuses, conflictual politics, economic mismanagement and national decadence. He wrote a second volume, Politics in Ghana - 1982-1992, dealing with the politics of revolution, CDRs, Public Tribunals, popular power, positive defiance and human rights issues of the period. His scholarly write-ups have been published in international journals such as Human Rights Quarterly (US), Journal of Commonwealth and Comparative Politics (UK), African Affairs (UK), and Review of Human Factor Studies (Canada). Political career As a student at the University of Ghana, Oquaye joined the campaign for the J. B. Danquah/Kofi Abrefa Busia cause. He strongly supported Busia's call for quick return to civilian rule to prevent the militarization of the state and, along with his family, helped to establish the Progress Party in Osu in 1969. The United Party-Progress Party tradition led to the foundation, in 1992, of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), with Oquaye as a founder member. He was the first Regional Secretary of NPP for Greater Accra in 1992, and also the first Chairman of the Party for the Ga District Rural Constituency, which later split into Ga West District and Ga East District. He was the secretary of the Research Committee and a member of the first National Campaign Team of the NPP in the third quarter of 1992. He worked with other central NPP figures, including President John Kufuor, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, R. R. Amponsah, Prof. Adu-Boahen, Peter Ala Adjetey, B. J. da Rocha and Samuel Odoi-Sykes to campaign successfully for the NPP victory in the 2000 general elections. His role in the party's success, which involved journalistic contributions and involvement in other activities of the party between 1993 and 2000, is considered significant. From 2001 to 2004, Oquaye served as Ghana's High Commissioner to India. His tenure as Ghana High Commissioner to India recorded achievement which includes Ghana Presidential Palace and Office Complex. In February 2005 he became Minister of Energy, and later he was moved to the post of Minister of Communications. Oquaye was the NPP Member of Parliament for Dome-Kwabenya for two terms, from 2004 to 2012. He decided not to stand for another term. He sponsored his son, Mike Oquaye Jnr. to fight to be the NPP Parliamentary Candidate for the constituency. His son however lost to Sarah Adwoa Safo, who went on to win the seat. From 2009 to 2013, Mike Oquaye was the Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament. He was succeeded by Joe Ghartey in 2013. Personal life Professor Oquaye is a pastor of the Baptist Church. He is husband of Mrs. Alberta Oquaye (n√©e Asafu-Adjaye) (Major Rtd.), and the father of Mike Oquaye Jnr, Ghana's current High Commissioner to India. His hobbies include watching football, playing table tennis, reading books, writing, and listening music.

In August 2020, he gave a public lecture in the observance of the Founders Day where he claimed ‚ÄúIndependence was not a one man show, it was a collective effort.‚Äù According to him, former president Nkrumah alone should not be honored alone but all the founding fathers of Ghana. He also claimed Nkrumah was not alone in the struggle for independence although he fought for Ghana's independence. Sekou Nkrumah, the son of Nkrumah lambasted Prof. Oquaye for those comments. According to Sekou, if the speaker of parliament wants to criticize his late father, he should talk about the one party system and the PDA during Nkrumah's time.

It was developed jointly by Intel and Microsoft and has been incorporated in PC chipsets since circa 2005. Formerly referred to by Intel as a Multimedia Timer, the term HPET was selected to avoid confusion with the software multimedia timers introduced in the MultiMedia Extensions to Windows 3.0. Older operating systems that do not support a hardware HPET device can only use older timing facilities, such as the programmable interval timer (PIT) or the real-time clock (RTC). Windows XP, when fitted with the latest hardware abstraction layer (HAL), can also use the processor's Time Stamp Counter (TSC) or Power Management Timer (PMTIMER), together with the RTC to provide operating system features that would, in later Windows versions, be provided by the HPET hardware. Confusingly, such Windows XP systems quote \\"HPET\\" connectivity in the device driver manager even though the Intel HPET device is not being used. Features An HPET chip consists of a 64-bit up- counter (main counter) counting at a frequency of at least 10 MHz, and a set of (at least three, up to 256) comparators. These comparators are 32- or 64-bit-wide. The HPET is programmed via a memory mapped I/O window that is discoverable via Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI). The HPET circuit in modern PCs is integrated into the southbridge chip. Each comparator can generate an interrupt when the least significant bits are equal to the corresponding bits of the 64-bit main counter value. The comparators can be put into one-shot mode or periodic mode, with at least one comparator supporting periodic mode and all of them supporting one-shot mode. In one-shot mode the comparator fires an interrupt once when the main counter reaches the value stored in the comparator's register, while in the periodic mode the interrupts are generated at specified intervals. Comparators can be driven by the operating system, e.g. to provide one timer per CPU for scheduling, or by applications. Applications The HPET can produce periodic interrupts at a much higher resolution than the RTC and is often used to synchronize multimedia streams, providing smooth playback and reducing the need to use other timestamp calculations such as an X86-based CPU's \`RDTSC\` instruction. Comparison to predecessors HPET is meant to supplement and replace the 8254 programmable interval timer and the RTC's periodic interrupt function. Compared to these older timer circuits, the HPET has higher frequency and wider 64-bit counters (although they can be driven in 32-bit mode). The HPET specification does not define the timer frequency, only requiring a minimum of 10 MHz; the actual frequency is provided to the operating system by a hardware register giving the number of femtoseconds per period (with an upper bound of ). A popular value is 14.3 MHz, 12 times the standard 8254 frequency of 1.193 MHz. While 8254 and RTC can be put into an HPET-like one-shot mode, the set-up process is so slow that their one-shot mode is not used in practice for tasks requiring precise scheduling. Instead, 8254 and RTC are typically used in periodic mode with a very small time interval. For example, if an application needs to perform several short (some milliseconds, perhaps) waits, it is better to have a periodic timer running constantly with a 1 ms period because of the high setup cost of an 8254 or RTC one-shot timer. This causes an interrupt at every millisecond even if the application needs to do actual work less frequently. With HPET, the extra interrupts can be avoided, because the set-up cost of a HPET one-shot timer is considerably smaller. Use and compatibility Operating systems designed before HPET existed cannot use HPET, so they use other timer facilities. Newer operating systems tend to be able to use either. Some hardware has both. Indeed, most current southbridge chips have legacy-supporting instances of PIT, PIC, Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) and RTC devices incorporated into their silicon whether or not they are used by the operating system, which helps very modern PCs run older operating systems. The following operating systems are known not to be able to use HPET: Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003, and earlier Windows versions, Linux kernels prior to 2.6. The following operating systems are known to be able to use HPET: Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows 7, x86 based versions of , Linux operating systems using the 2.6 kernel (or later), FreeBSD and OpenSolaris. The Linux kernel can also use HPET as its clock source. The documentation of Red Hat MRG version 2 states that TSC is the preferred clock source due to its much lower overhead, but it uses HPET as a fallback. A benchmark in that environment for 10 million event counts found that TSC took about 0.6 seconds, HPET took slightly over 12 seconds, and ACPI Power Management Timer took around 24 seconds. In 2019 it was decided to blacklist HPET in newer Linux kernels when running on some Intel CPUs (Coffee Lake) because of its instability. Problems HPET is a continuously running timer that counts upward, not a one-shot device that counts down to zero, causes one interrupt and then stops. Since HPET compares the actual timer value and the programmed target value on equality rather than \\"greater or equal\\", interrupts can be missed if the target time has already passed when the comparator value is written into the chip's register. In such a case, not only is the intended interrupt missed, but actually set far into the future (about 232 or 264 counts). In the presence of non-maskable interrupts (such as a System Management Interrupt (SMI)) that do not have a hard upper bound on their execution time, this race condition requires time-consuming re-checks of the timer after setup and is hard to avoid completely. The difficulties are exacerbated if the comparator value is not synchronized with the timer immediately, but delayed by one or two ticks, as some chipsets do.Thomas Gleixner, x86: hpet: Work around hardware stupidity , commit merged for Linux kernel 2.6.36-rc5 Besides mentioning the race condition discussed above, a VMware document also lists some other drawbacks: \\"The specification does not require the timer to be particularly fine grained, to have low drift, or to be fast to read. Some typical implementations run the counter at about 18 MHz and require about the same amount of time (1‚Äì2 Œºs) to read the HPET as with the ACPI timer. Implementations have been observed in which the period register is off by 800 parts per million or more.\\"Timekeeping in VMware Virtual Machines (for VMware vSphere 5.0, Workstation 8.0, Fusion 4.0), page 9 Notes References Category:Integrated circuits ","title":"High Precision Event Timer"},{"id":"2508211","text":"Kaare Klint (15 December 1888 - 28 March 1954) was a Danish architect and furniture designer, known as the father of modern Danish furniture design. Style was epitomized by clean, pure lines, use of the best materials of his time and superb craftsmanship. He was the son of the equally influential architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint whose monumental Grundtvig's Church he completed after his father's death in 1930. Early life and education Kaare Klint was born on 15 December 1888 in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, the son of Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint, then a struggling painter about to abandon his artistic career in place of a more secure career in architecture. Klint apprenticed as a furniture maker in Kalundborg and Copenhagen from 1893 and took classes at technical school in Copenhagen, Jens M√∏ller-Jensens furniture school, and the Artists' Studio Schools under Johan Rohde. He was then articled to Carl Petersen and was also taught the architectural trade by his father, who had completed his first architectural project in 1896. Design career In 1914, Klint designed his first piece of furniture, the Faaborg Chair, for Carl Petersen's Faaborg Museum in 1914. He went on to create furniture and fittings for a number of other museums. From 1921 to 1926 he was responsible for the conversion of Frederiks Hospital into the Danish Museum of Art & Design together with Thorkild Henningsen and Ivar Bentsen. In 1927 he also created a chair in mahogany for the museum which was inspired by English 18th-century chairs. Klint's carefully researched furniture designs are based on functionality, proportions adapted to the human body, craftsmanship, and the use of high-quality materials. Notable examples of his work include the Propeller Stool (1927), the Safari Chair and the Deck Chair (both 1933), the Church Chair (1936), and the Circle Bed (1938) featuring curved sides and rounded ends, with hand-woven textiles by Lis Ahlmann.\\"Kaare Klint\\", Danish-furniture.com. Retrieved 24 October 2011.Mussari, Mark. Danish Modern: Between Art and Design. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016, pp. 84-87. As a result of the furniture school he founded at the Royal Academy in 1924, Klint had a strong influence on Danish furniture, inspiring designers such as Poul Kj√¶rholm and B√∏rge Mogensen. He also designed textiles, lamps, and organs. Completion of his father's unfinished works After his father's death in 1930, Kaare Klint completed his monumental Grundtvig's Church in Copenhagen. Construction had started in 1921 but was not completed until 1940. He also designed the Bethlehem Church, also in Copenhagen, on the basis of his father's sketches. It was built from 1935 to 1937.

Gurney Braithwaite came from a Quaker family and was educated at Downs School, Colwall and Bootham School , York. During World War I, he served in the Royal Navy at the Suvla Bay landing, Gallipoli, and in Palestine. He became a stockbroker and company director. Braithwaite contested Rotherhithe without success in 1929, and was elected the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sheffield Hillsborough at the 1931 general election, losing the seat in 1935 to the previous incumbent, A. V. Alexander. He re-entered Parliament in a 1939 by-election for Holderness. In Parliament, he was active on issues relating to ex-servicemen and the Navy, and was himself a lieutenant-commander in the RNVR. During World War II he helped organise convoys in the Thames area. At the 1950 general election, Braithwaite's Holderness seat was abolished and he was elected for the marginal Bristol North West constituency. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport in the government of Winston Churchill from 1951 to 1953. He was made a baronet on 28 January 1954. Boundary changes involved his seat being redrawn to Labour's advantage, and at the 1955 general election Braithwaite lost. He died three years later, aged 63.

The name Mendoza means \\"cold mountain\\", derived from the Basque words mendi (mountain) and (h)otz (cold) + definite article '-a' (Mendoza being mendi+(h)otza). The original Basque form with an affricate sibilant (/ts/, Basque spelling /tz/) evolved in Spanish to the current form. History Records of the Mendoza family can be traced back to the Middle Ages in Alava, in the Basque Country. It is believed that the family descends from the ancient Lords of Llodio (Alava), where the original patronymic house would have been. The Mendozas belonged to the local nobility, and branched out into different family lines early on. The most distinguished branch of the family originated in what nowadays is known as the village of Mendoza, near Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country; the village takes its name after the family. A certain scion of this family, I√±igo Lopez de Mendoza, distinguished himself in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1218), where he probably served under Navarrese banner. He was responsible for building the ancestral home of the family, the Tower of Mendoza, which still stands. This branch of the family entered the service of the Kingdom of Castile during the reign of Alfonso XI (1312-1350), and took active part in the Reconquista, where they quickly acquired extensive land holdings in Castile and southern Spain through military and political service. The members of the House of Mendoza intermarried extensively with the Castilian nobility, and the family has many descendants nowadays, with numerous nobility titles attached to it. The line of the Dukes of the Infantado formed one of the main branches of the family. Another branch of the family was based in Laudio, 50km northwest from Vitoria-Gasteiz. The family got involved in the medieval bloody War of the Clans. Finally, in Erandio, a baserri exists under the same name. Its original name \\"mendotza\\" developed to \\"mendontze\\" in the 1890s, \\"mendoche\\" in the 1920s, \\"mendotxe\\" in the 1980s to the restored original of \\"mendotza\\" being the current. The surname spread quickly through Castile during the Middle Ages. With the discovery of America, many of its members would emigrate to the Americas, where the surname is common.

Music and lyrics  Folds said of the inspiration for the song: > \\"I used to do this big rant at the end of some gigs with Ben Folds Five. The > band broke into this big heavy metal thing and I started as a joke to scream > in a heavy metal falsetto. I found myself saying things like: Feel my pain, > I am white, feel my pain.

I mean, I would be happy to tell the > guys from Korn that I wrote a song about them, but I think, when people > listen to it, it is a better song when it is not directed to anybody.\\" The song parodies Korn and Rage Against the Machine. Folds stated of the song \\"I am taking the piss out of the whole scene, especially the followers.\\" The lyrics for a portion of the song are often changed during live performances. In the refrain of the song, \\"I'm rockin' the suburbs, just like ______ did\\", Folds inserts the name of a musical artist. In the album version, the order for the names is: Michael Jackson, Quiet Riot, and Jon Bon Jovi. For live performances Ben has inserted other names, such as Bryan Adams. On the Songs for Goldfish version, he mentions William Shatner (for whom he produced an album, Has Been) and Henry Rollins (whom he worked with on Shatner's song \\"I Can't Get Behind That\\"). Single track listing #\\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\" [Radio Edit] #\\"Girl\\" #\\"Make Me Mommy\\" #\\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\" [Video] Japanese EP: #\\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\" [Radio Edit] #\\"One Down\\" #\\"Girl\\" #\\"Make Me Mommy\\" #\\"The Secret Life of Morgan Davis\\" Music video The music video for \\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\" was directed by friend \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, who also plays the role of a producer who fixes Folds' \\"shitty track,\\" directly riffing on one of the song's lyrics. The video, which resembles the style of Yankovic's own videos, features Folds playing multiple members of an angry rock band in a suburban den and in front of a white background. After the song's bridge, Folds is shown outside in a suburban neighborhood wearing a backwards red New York Yankees cap, the trademark of Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, while singing the lyrics, \\"girl give me something I can break\\", which were a riff on the Limp Bizkit song \\"Break Stuff\\". During this portion of the video, Folds engages in \\"suburban\\" activities such as skateboarding, jumping in pools and flipping burgers. At the end of the video, the \\"band\\" (all played by Folds again) plays in front of a black background with holes punched in it, a style that deliberately matches the live-action parts of the Korn video for \\"Freak on a Leash.\\" A subliminal message reading \\"Korn Sucks\\" briefly appears.  Over the Hedge remake  In 2006, Folds rewrote the song for the animated movie Over the Hedge, with film co-star William Shatner providing vocals during part of the song. Shatner does the voice for Ozzie the Opossum, who encourages his teenage daughter Heather (voice by Avril Lavigne) to play dead in threatening situations. While the new version features none of the swearing and parodies of the original, Folds makes some very pointed barbs at the concept of suburbia in the song, including jabs at homeowner associations and driving long distances to work. This version of the song was also featured in the film Marley & Me.

It consists of coupons, issued by the company, which resemble real banknotes. It can be used as scrip in Canadian Tire stores, but is not considered a private currency. The notes are printed on paper similar to what Canadian currency was printed on when they were still paper, and were jointly produced by two of the country's long-established security printers, British American Banknote Company (BABN) and Canadian Bank Note Company (CBN).\\"Canadian Tire Scrip\\", Numismatist Magazine, Harold Don Allen, p.64, Volume 119, Number 12, December 2006 Some privately owned businesses in Canada accept CTM as payment (see history below), since the owners of many such businesses shop at Canadian Tire. In Canadian Tire stores, CTM is accepted for Canadian money at par. In April 2018, Canadian Tire announced that they would be shifting to Triangle Rewards, a card based rewards program. However, consumers without the card would still earn paper Canadian Tire money. History and dynamics A recognizable facet of CTM is the man featured on the face of each bill. According to Canadian Tire representatives, the fictional character represented is referred to as \\"Sandy McTire\\" and sports a tam o' shanter and a stylized waxed moustache. He is based on no specific individual but is assumed to represent a thrifty Scotsman, the 1950s everyman of blue-collar Canada. It was introduced in 1958, and was inspired by Muriel Billes, the wife of Canadian Tire's co-founder and first president, Alfred J. Billes, as a response to the promotional giveaways that many gas companies offered at the time. It was only available at Canadian Tire gas bars but was so successful that, in 1961, it was extended to the retail stores as well, and has become the most successful loyalty program in Canadian retail history. The print on the 'notes' refers to them as \\"cash bonus coupons\\". Canadian Tire money is given out for purchases paid for by cash or debit, based on the pre-tax total, excluding labour and shop supplies costs. The initial coupon rate earned was 5% of the eligible purchase price, but it was lowered to 3%, then to 1.4%, and now is 0.4%. Customers can use Canadian Tire money to buy anything in the store. (Older coupons state that they are redeemable at Canadian Tire stores and gas stations; however, coupons produced during at least the last 15 years lack this wording and are therefore redeemable in the stores only.) It can also be used to cover the sales tax on the purchases, since it is accepted as cash after the taxes are calculated. Also, even if a purchase was made entirely in these coupons, it is also considered as a cash purchase and more coupons will be calculated and paid out. In Ontario, the Retail Sales Tax law and Bulletins state that the \\"coupon must be reimbursed by the franchisee\\". By submitting them to other merchants, the merchants were in essence breaking Ontario law when they failed to include the discount in the value of the goods being calculated for being taxed. Some merchants were accepting Canadian Tire money as a discount, but then were not calculating and remitting the sales taxes, as required by law, and then were getting fined for the practice; this is an ongoing issue. In 2012, Canadian Tire began a pilot program to make its money \\"plastic\\", to make it into a more manageable and trackable loyalty program. The new plastic loyalty card can earn points at more than twice the rate of the traditional paper money. According to customer service in July 2017 the rate on purchases made with the Canadian Tire \\"Options\\" card on in- store products is 4%. The reward rate for purchases at other stores is 0.8%. Denominations In 1958, five different denominations (composed of 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, and $1) were issued. The revision of 1962 included the introduction of four lower values (1 to 4 cents), and 12 higher denominations, including 35 and 60 cents. A sequence of six denominations was introduced in 1985 including the 3 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 40 cents, 50 cents, and $1. A $2 note was added in 1989, and the 3 cents was dropped in 1991.\\"Canadian Tire Scrip\\", Numismatist Magazine, Harold Don Allen, p.65, Volume 119, Number 12, December 2006 CTM coupons are now produced in denominations of 5-, 10-, 25 and 50 cents and one and two-dollars. In addition, Canadian Tire money can be earned electronically on Canadian Tire credit cards such as the Canadian Tire Options MasterCard. The latter can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted and earns Canadian Tire money no matter where it is used to make a purchase, anywhere in the world. CTM is treated as real currency by the franchise and cannot be directly exchanged for real Canadian currency for customers. If an item bought with Canadian Tire money is returned the customer receives either Canadian Tire money back or is given the amount on a gift card. If an item is bought with cash or card and is returned for a refund the customer receives the refund less the value of the CTM issued on the item unless the CTM is also returned. On December 2, 2009, as part of an advertised deal, Canadian Tire had handed out the first Canadian Tire coin, redeemable with the purchase of at least $40 of merchandise. Another similar deal followed in 2010 (coinciding with the 2010 Olympic Winter Games), with a three coin winter collection. The coins can be spent in the same manner as conventional CTM. Usage beyond Canadian Tire * In late 2004 in Moncton, New Brunswick, several customers at a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ATM were dispensed a total of 11 bills of Canadian Tire money instead of real bills. They were compensated by the bank. * Culturally, Canadian Tire money is sometimes referred to by comedians: perhaps as a national version of \\"Monopoly money\\", perhaps invoking a pejorative comparison of the value of Canadian dollars against U.S. dollars, or perhaps as a misunderstood exotic element of Canadian society (e.g. Ron James's comedic reference to the person depicted on the bill as \\"our king\\"). In the 2009 Trailer Park Boys movie Countdown to Liquor Day, Jim Lahey offers Julian $700 in Canadian Tire money for his trailer. * In the mid-1990s, a man in Germany was caught with up to $11 million in counterfeit Canadian Tire money. It was recovered before he left for Canada to redeem it. * In 2012, musician Corin Raymond funded his album Paper Nickels partially through a fundraising campaign inviting fans to donate their unused Canadian Tire money.\\"Corin Raymond paid for new album with stacks of Canadian Tire money\\".

Accountant‚Äìclient privileges may be classified in two categories: evidentiary privileges and non-evidentiary privileges. An evidentiary privilege is one that may as a general rule be successfully asserted in a court of law. A non- evidentiary privilege is (A) one that may not be maintained in a court of law, or (B) one which is, according to the terms of the statute granting the privilege, not applicable in the face of an order from the court compelling disclosure of the communication for which the privilege is claimed. The evidentiary and non-evidentiary versions of the accountant-client privilege are, as a general rule, creations of Federal or state statute. Under English common law, on which American law is based, there was generally no accountant‚Äìclient privilege. In the United Kingdom in particular the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 actually requires accountants (and solicitors, insolvency practitioners, etc.) who suspect their clients of tax evasion to report them to the authorities without telling the clients they have done so, subject to a maximum punishment of 14 years in jail. This affects even accountants who uncover a possibly inadvertent claim for expenses. In Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal took note of the American policy but refused to give any weight to it on the grounds that it is for Parliament to choose to enact a similar rule in Canada. Non-evidentiary accountant‚Äìclient privileges Some states have enacted a non-evidentiary accountant‚Äìclient privilege. For example, Texas has a privilege rule that requires that a certified public accountant (CPA) not voluntarily disclose information communicated to the CPA by a client in connection with the engagement without the client's permission. The privilege generally does not apply, however, in the case of an administrative summons by the Internal Revenue Service under , in the case of a summons under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or in the case of a court order.Tex. Occup. Code sec. 901.457. (A few other exceptions also apply under the Texas law.) The federally authorized tax practitioner privilege The federally authorized tax practitioner privilege, is a limited evidentiary privilege available in American federal tax law. The privilege is defined in an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code made by the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998:Pub. L. No. 105-206 (H.R. 2676) (July 22, 1998). ::With respect to tax advice, the same common law protections of confidentiality which apply to a communication between a taxpayer and an attorney shall also apply to a communication between a taxpayer and any federally authorized tax practitioner to the extent the communication would be considered a privileged communication if it were between a taxpayer and an attorney.. Under the law, the term \\"federally authorized tax practitioner\\" (or FATP) means an individual authorized under Federal law to practice before the Internal Revenue Service where the practice is subject to Federal regulation under .See . The term 'tax advice' means advice given by an individual with respect to a matter that is within the scope of the individual's authority to practice.See . There are, however, some significant limitations on the FATP privilege. =Not applicable in criminal proceedings or state law matters= Unlike the attorney‚Äìclient privilege, the FATP privilege does not apply in criminal matters, and does not apply in state tax proceedings. The privilege may be asserted only in a \\"noncriminal tax matter before the Internal Revenue Service\\" and a \\"noncriminal tax proceeding in Federal court brought by or against the United States.\\" =Effect of date of the communication on availability of the FATP privilege= The FATP privilege applies only to communications made on or after July 22, 1998. The privilege does not apply to any written communication before October 22, 2004, between a federally authorized tax practitioner and a director, shareholder, officer, employee, agent, or representative of a corporation in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation of such corporation in any tax shelter.The term tax shelter is defined in . Section 7525 was amended by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,Pub. L. No. 108-357. so that the privilege does not apply to written communications made on or after October 22, 2004, involving a federally authorized tax practitioner with respect to the participation of any person (not just a corporation) in a tax shelter. This is a further limitation of the privilege. =The practitioner= The term FATP includes an attorney, a CPA, an enrolled agent, or an enrolled actuary. The FATP privilege does not generally apply to accountants who are not CPAs or EAs (unless they qualify as enrolled actuaries). The FATP privilege might not apply to certified public accountants who are not licensed to practice in the state in which the client lives (for example, in a situation where the client lives in New Jersey but works in New York, where he consults a CPA who is licensed in New York but not in New Jersey). Because the CPA is not licensed to practice in the state where the client resides, the communication might not qualify for the privilege. =Tax advice versus business advice= The FATP privilege applies only to tax advice. The advice must be treated as confidential by both the accountant and the client to be covered by the privilege. If the communication is divulged to third parties, then it is not confidential. The privilege does not cover general business consultations or personal financial planning advice. =Tax return preparation= With respect to communications involved in the preparation of tax returns, there is a split of authority. Much of the relevant case law was rendered prior to the creation of the FATP privilege in 1998, and relates to the attorney‚Äìclient privilege. Most of the case law indicates that a communication in connection with tax return preparation is not covered. Under the argument accepted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, communication pertinent merely to preparing a tax return does not involve giving or receiving legal advice (see e.g., United States v. Gurtner).474 F.2d 297 (9th Cir. 1973). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, meanwhile, has held that tax returns are not privileged. This holding is based on the rationale that tax returns are intended for disclosure to a third party, i.e., the Internal Revenue Service, so there can be no expectation of confidentiality,This use of the term \\"confidentiality\\" should not be confused with the rules regarding confidentiality of tax returns and tax return information held by the Internal Revenue Service or the practitioner, at , , , and . The confidentiality protections in those rules do not render the communication \\"confidential\\" for purposes of the FATP privilege. which defeats a claim that the return or pertinent communication is privileged.See United States v. Cote, 456 F.2d 142 (8th Cir. 1972). One minority view finds the privilege might apply to a communication about what to claim on a return.See United States v. Abrahams, 90-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,310 (9th Cir. 1990). Another minority view is that such communications could be considered \\"legal\\" advice.See generally Colton v. United States, 306 F.2d 633 (2d Cir. 1962); contrast with Gurtner above. On balance, however, the weight of authority is that communication in connection with tax return preparation is probably not protected by the privilege.

The game was released for the PlayStation and Dreamcast and was developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive. Overview Set in the not-too-distant future, human cloning has become a reality but has been banned by international treaty. The Knackmiche Corporation is suspected of researching cloning, and mercenary Hawk Manson is sent on a covert mission to investigate. It features hand-to-hand and weapons combat like the original game but does not include multiplayer support. While it includes more weapons and larger levels than its predecessor, the sequel includes only one playable character this time around: Hawk Manson. Reception Unlike its predecessor which received some decent reviews, Fighting Force 2 was not very successful, and received mixed reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Blake Fischer of NextGen said in its February 2000 issue that the PlayStation version was \\"Solid, but ultimately uninspiring. You'll burn out on this game long before you beat it.\\" An issue later, Jeff Lundrigan of the same magazine called the Dreamcast version \\"The very definition of a two-star game: 'Perhaps competent; certainly uninspired.'\\" Due to its lackluster sales and a less-than-pleased fanbase, the series eventually ended. A third game was in development, but was cancelled when Core Design closed down.

Like the 1962 PDP-1 program Spacewar! it is based on, it uses black and white vector graphics for the visuals. The hardware developed for Space Wars became the platform for most of the vector-based arcade games from Cinematronics. A Vectrex port was published in 1982. Gameplay Two players controlled different ships. One button rotated the ship left, another rotated the ship right, one engaged thrust, one fired a shell, and one entered hyperspace (which causes the ship to disappear and reappear elsewhere on the playfield at random). The game offered a number of gameplay options, including the presence or absence of a star in the middle of the playfield (which exerted a positive or negative gravitational pull), whether the edges of the playfield wrapped around to their opposite sides, and whether shells bounced. The game had three particular features: First, the game could not be played in \\"one player\\" mode; a human opponent was required. Second, the player's ship could take a glancing hit without dying, but would suffer damage; a cloud of loose ship fragments would break off and float away, after which the ship would be visibly damaged on screen and would turn and accelerate more slowly. Third and most memorable was that the duration of play for any contest was solely governed by the amount of money deposited; each quarter bought a minute and a half of play. A dollar bought six minutes, and for a ten dollar roll of quarters two players could play non-stop for an hour. Development Larry Rosenthal was an MIT graduate who was fascinated with the original Spacewar! and developed his own custom hardware and software so that he could play the game. Cinematronics worked with Rosenthal to produce the Space Wars system. Legacy Space Wars formed the basis of the platform used by Cinematronics for their subsequent black-and-white vector games such as Star Castle and Tail Gunner.

The basic graphic notation elements of DSDs are boxes which represent entities. The arrow symbol represents relationships. Data structure diagrams are most useful for documenting complex data entities. Overview Data Structure Diagram Data Structure Diagram is a diagram type that is used to depict the structure of data elements in the data dictionary. The data structure diagram is a graphical alternative to the composition specifications within such data dictionary entries.Data Integration Glossary , U.S. Department of Transportation, August 2001. The data structure diagrams is a predecessor of the entity‚Äìrelationship model (E‚ÄìR model). In DSDs, attributes are specified inside the entity boxes rather than outside of them, while relationships are drawn as boxes composed of attributes which specify the constraints that bind entities together. DSDs differ from the E‚ÄìR model in that the E‚ÄìR model focuses on the relationships between different entities, whereas DSDs focus on the relationships of the elements within an entity. There are several styles for representing data structure diagrams, with the notable difference in the manner of defining cardinality. The choices are between arrow heads, inverted arrow heads (crow's feet), or numerical representation of the cardinality.

The model is named after database pioneer Charles Bachman, and mostly used in computer software design. In a relational model, a relation is the cohesion of attributes that are fully and not of every key in that relation. The coupling between the relations is based on accordant attributes. For every relation, a rectangle has to be drawn and every coupling is illustrated by a line that connects the relations. On the edge of each line, arrows indicate the cardinality. We have 1-to-n, 1-to-1 and n-to-n. The latter has to be avoided and must be replaced by two (or more) 1-to-n couplings.

It follows a psychosexual cat-and-mouse game between a corrupt cop (Oldman), and a ruthless mob assassin (Olin) who begins to unravel his carefully constructed double life. The film's title was taken from a song by Tom Waits. Released domestically by Gramercy Pictures, the film was critically unsuccessful and a box office bomb (grossing $3.3 million from a $10 million budget), although its acting has garnered praise. Plot Jack Grimaldi is a homicide detective with the NYPD who seems to have everything; a beautiful wife named Natalie, and an adoring teenage mistress named Sheri. However, his lavish lifestyle is funded through extensive corruption, doing favors for Mafia boss Don Falcone in exchange for large cash bribes. His latest task is to reveal the location of Nick Gazarra, a mobster-turned-state's witness protected by federal agents. Gazarra and his protection detail are subsequently killed by a mob hitwoman, Mona Demarkov. Grimaldi is disaffected by this outcome, being uncomfortable with his complicity in the deaths of other law enforcement personnel. Mona is arrested and Falcone gives Grimaldi a new assignment, to kill Mona, whom he fears could not only testify against him, but be planning to take over his entire operation. Still reluctant about his double life, Grimaldi is assigned as Mona's minder as she is transported to a safe house to await pick-up by federal agents. Upon arrival, Mona quickly seduces and tries to kill him, but their impromptu tryst is interrupted by the arrival of the agents and Jack leaves her to be detained. Falcone, disappointed in Jack's ineptitude, orders one of his toes amputated. Realizing he has endangered both his wife and mistress, Jack instructs Natalie to leave the city immediately, giving her all the payoff money he has saved as well as instructions of where to meet him out West when the time is right. Jack ends his affair with Sheri and puts her on a train out of the city. Jack tries to hunt Demarkov but is attracted to her sexually and no match for her professionally. Mona offers to pay Jack to help her fake her own death. Although he obtains false papers for her, she refuses to pay and attempts to strangle Jack. He shoots and wounds her in the arm, then tries to drive away with her handcuffed in the back seat. Mona escapes by hooking her legs around his neck, causing him to crash the car. She slithers out through the shattered windshield without freeing her hands. Mona lures Jack to an empty apartment. He again attempts to kill her but is tricked into shooting Sheri instead. Mona fixes the corpse so as to suggest that it was she, and not Sheri, who died. Mona has Jack abducted and transported to an abandoned warehouse: she handcuffs him to a bed and they have sex. Later Mona forces Jack to assist in burying Falcone alive. Mona then betrays Jack by turning him into the police, copping a plea deal that will indict Jack for the multiple murders that she tricked him into committing. The police arrange a confrontation between Jack and Demarkov at the courthouse, as he is heading in and she is heading out. She threatens to kill his wife, prompting Jack to grab a gun from the ankle holster of a fellow officer and shoot her dead. He turns the gun on himself, only to discover that the revolver is empty. Instead of being sent to prison for the murder, he is given a commendation. This frees him to begin a new life in the West, under the identity of \\"Jim Daugherty\\". The final scene shows Jack living alone in a remote desert town and working as a bartender. He longs for Natalie's return and laments the loss of his old life.

Reception Despite an unfavorable critical response to the film, Gary Oldman's performance has garnered acclaim. Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert said that while Oldman is \\"unsurpassable\\" in portraying depraved characters, the film is \\"an exercise in overwrought style and overwritten melodrama, and proof that a great cast cannot save a film from self-destruction.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety also had praise for the central cast, but called the film a \\"heavy dose of ultra-violent neo-noir\\" whose \\"far-fetched plotting eventually goes so far over the top that [the] pic flirts with inventing a new genre of film noir camp.\\" New York Times journalist Janet Maslin lauded Oldman as a \\"master craftsman\\" who gives an \\"uncanny performance as a slang-spouting American\\", but concluded, \\"For all its promise, and for all the brittle beauty of Dariusz Wolski's cinematography, Romeo Is Bleeding eventually collapses under the weight of its violent affectations.\\" A favorable Peter Travers in Rolling Stone called the film a \\"scorcher of a thriller\\" with a \\"knockout performance\\" by Olin. He added, \\"It will be a shame if audiences don't get the joke\\". In a retrospective review, Dennis Schwartz referred to the film as a \\"senseless, tasteless and demented postmodern noir\\", but commended Olin's \\"menacing\\" turn as well as the initial interaction between Oldman and Scheider. Randy Miller of DVD Talk wrote, \\"It's a wild and entertaining ride, to be sure... but not one without its fair share of bumps along the way, and one you probably won't revisit on a regular basis.

The Christmas Conference was an historic founding conference of the newly independent Methodists within the United States held just after the American Revolution at Lovely Lane Chapel in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1784. Prior to the revolution, American Methodism consisted of itinerant preachers commissioned by John Wesley the founder of the Methodist societies in England. Wesley had been sending preacher/missionaries since the 1760s. With the outbreak of war, most of these returned to England, with the exception of Francis Asbury and James Dempster. Asbury began to be looked upon as the leader of the groups, whereas Dempster moved to upstate New York, where he ministered locally. His activities were greatly restricted because, as an Englishman, he was suspected of not being sympathetic to the patriot cause. During the war, he ceased his circuit riding and stayed at the residence of his friend, Judge Thomas White of Delaware. Before the war, the Methodist itinerant preachers were appointed to form societies, but they were expected by Wesley to work within the Anglican Church, as they were not ordained. They were not allowed to administer the sacraments. This produced some difficulty as Anglican Churches were limited to the coastal cities, and the itinerant preachers were moving westward and inland. Similarly the Anglican clergy almost all left for England with the outbreak of war. Asbury had come to America in 1771. Under his leadership, conferences were formed and American preachers appointed, but this did not solve the problem of the administration of the sacraments. During the war, the societies continued to grow, albeit more slowly due to all the disruptions. Following the war, there was a move to locally ordain the preachers, but Asbury counselled patience until Wesley gave direction. In England, at the Methodist Conference in Leeds in July 1784, Wesley himself ordained Richard Whatcoat and Thomas Vasey as elders, appointing them to go, along with a group of itinerant preachers to America. Wesley then ordained Thomas Coke (who was already an ordained Anglican priest) to go as superintendent of the American church. He gave Coke instructions to also ordain Francis Asbury as co-superintendent. Wesley was reluctant to take this action, but he had already asked for the Bishop of London to ordain a bishop for America, and had been rebuffed. Meeting with Asbury on November 14, 1784, Coke explained Wesley's intentions and proposed to ordain him. Asbury, catching the spirit of democracy in the new country, refrained from accepting the ordination until approved by the American connexion. Messengers were sent, calling the American itinerants to Baltimore on December 24. Eighty one preachers were entitled to membership; nearly sixty of them were able to arrive for the conference.James E. Kirby, Russell E. Richey, and Kenneth E. Rowe, The Methodists (Greenwood Press, 1996), 7. During the six weeks while waiting for the conference, Coke and Asbury went on a preaching tour (on horseback) that covered at least 900 miles.Richard P. Heizenrater, Wesley and the People Called Methodists(Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1995), 291. With the Christmas Conference's unanimous approval, Asbury was ordained and appointed as co-superintendent. He was ordained deacon on Christmas Day by laying on of hands; elder on the next day; and superintendent the next. Asbury's friend Philip William Otterbein, pastor of the German Reformed Church of Baltimore, also laid hands on Asbury to assist in the ordination.James E. Kirby, Russell E. Richey, and Kenneth E. Rowe, The Methodists (Greenwood Press, 1996), 7. Coke later said of Asbury, \\"In the presence of Mr. Asbury, I feel myself a child. He is in my estimation, the most apostolic man I ever saw, except Mr. Wesley.\\" Coke preached Asbury's ordination sermon, which was later published and caused some stir in England because he emphasized the need to ordain only godly men, and pointed to England for an example of immoral and unconverted men to orders. This conference, which became known as the first General Conference of the new church, abridged the 39 Articles of Religion of the Anglican Church into 24, added one additional one about civic duties as US citizens, and adopted them as its governing principles, also known as the Discipline. They also received a modified prayer book sent by Wesley.Thomas C. Oden, Doctrinal Standards in the Methodist Tradition, Revised Edition (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2008), 31. John Dickins a pastor in New York proposed the name of the fledgeling church: the Methodist Episcopal Church. The conference also ordained 12 preachers to orders, setting a precedent for the American church that ordinations were to be approved by the conference. Immediately after the ten-day conference, Asbury set out circuit riding as he had before the war. His first destination was Charleston, South Carolina which he deemed the city most in need of spiritual enlightenment. The American church held another General Conference in 1792 and every four years after.

It is bestowed on an intercollegiate basis by the four Royal Colleges of Surgeons (the Royal College of Surgeons of England, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (chartered 1784), Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (chartered 1505), and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow). The initials may be used as post-nominal letters. Several Commonwealth countries have organisations that bestow similar qualifications, among them the FRCSC in Canada, FRACS in Australia and New Zealand, FCS(SA) in South Africa, FCSHK in Hong Kong and FCPS by College of Physicians & Surgeons of Mumbai in India. The intercollegiate FRCS examinations are administered by two committees, the JCIE (Joint Committee on Intercollegiate Examinations, which handles domestic examinations) and the JSCFE (Joint Surgical Colleges Fellowship Examination, which handles overseas examinations). This system replaced the earlier one in which each college administered its own examinations. First the curricula were intercollegiately coordinated by the ISCP (Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme) of the JCST (Joint Committee on Surgical Training), and then the examinations became intercollegiate. The original fellowship was available in general surgery and in certain specialties‚Äîophthalmic or ENT surgery, or obstetrics and gynaecology‚Äîwhich were not indicated in the initials. It came to be taken midway through training. Each of the four Royal Colleges of Surgeons of the UK and Ireland used to administer its own examinations. The four postnominals were FRCS(Eng), FRCS(Ed), FRCS(G), and FRCS(I). The FRCS designation without further specification then referred by convention/tradition to FRCS(Eng) specifically. Today the examination and qualification are intercollegiate, although each surgeon can still choose afterward to be affiliated with one or more specific colleges. (In Canada the FRCS(C) qualification is administered by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.) There are now a range of higher fellowships, taken at the end of higher specialist training and often in narrower fields, the first of which was FRCS (Orth) in orthopaedics. Others include FRCS (Urol) in urology and FRCS (OMFS) in maxillofacial surgery. Membership of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons The MRCS examinations are also now intercollegiate. Mister or Doctor? Holders of FRCS (and the new, but not old, Membership ‚Äì MRCS) often choose for traditional reasons to relinquish their title of \\"Doctor\\", reverting to \\"Mr\\", \\"Ms\\", \\"Mrs\\" or \\"Miss\\". Until relatively recently - the early 19th century - the training as a surgeon was through an apprenticeship, at the end of which, if they had learnt their trade in a large city, they were examined and given a diploma; while physicians from the Middle Ages had to hold a university degree in medicine before they could practise. Today, for most, the route to Fellowship is lengthy: one must qualify as a Doctor of medicine, then undergo further postgraduate study and training through junior doctor posts before then passing assessments to obtain surgical qualifications. There are some exceptions: honour fellows, consultant podiatric surgeons and surgical care practitioners. At that point many choose to stop prefixing their name with Dr and revert to the prefix they used before qualifying (or one they have since acquired.) FRCS can be awarded without appearing for the fellowship examination based on the recommendation of the College Council. Such surgeons are usually surgeons of high calibre who have had distinguished achievements in their career. One such category is called Conferred Fellow. A fellow selected via this category will be entitled to use post-nominal FRCS(Glasg), and hence there will be no difference in terms of post-nominals between this category of FRCS and others.

Originally, gaiters were made of leather or canvas. Today, gaiters for walking are commonly made of plasticized synthetic cloth such as polyester. Gaiters for use on horseback continue to be made of leather. Terminology In army parlance, a gaiter covers leg and bootlacing; a legging covers only the leg. In RAF parlance, gaiter includes legging. The American Army during World War I. and World War II had leggings, which were gaiters. Above the knee spatterdashes were cotton or canvas, as were many gaiters of varying lengths thereafter. Leather gaiters were rare in military, though sometimes a calf-length cotton gaiter had leather kneecaps added. Leggings, however, were very often made of leather, but also canvas. On foot U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard wearing white canvas leggings, as the part of the Enlisted Full Dress Whites or Blue Gaiters are a type of protective clothing for a person's ankles and legs below the knee. Gaiters are worn when walking, hiking, running (especially orienteering and rogaining) outdoors amongst dense underbrush or in snow, with or without snowshoes. Heavy gaiters are often worn when using crampons, to protect the leg and ankle from the spikes of the opposite foot. Gaiters strap over the hiking boot and around the person's leg to provide protection from branches and thorns and to prevent mud, snow, etc. from entering the top of the boot. Gaiters may also be worn as protection against snake bites. Gaiters fill the same function as puttees, a part of numerous military uniforms. Gaiters known as jambieres (derived from the French word jambe for legs, hence leggings) were part of the uniform of Zouave infantry regiments. On horseback Over-the-knee gaiters worn by a Chilean rodeo rider During the 19th century gaiters for riding typically were known as riding gaiters, distinguishing them from the other gaiters that were in general use. Today, half chaps are a type of gaiter worn by equestrians. Most forms fit over the calf. These are intended to protect the rider's leg from wear by the stirrup leathers and other saddle parts. Modern styles usually have a zipper or hook and loop fasteners on the outside of the leg. Bishop of Lichfield, in Vanity Fair, 1897 In the Anglican church Gaiters formed a part of the everyday clerical clothing of bishops and archdeacons of the Church of England until the middle part of the twentieth century. They were also worn by some cathedral deans. They were made of black cotton, wool, or silk, and buttoned up the sides, reaching to just below the knee where they would join with black breeches. Gaiters would be worn with a clerical apron, a type of short cassock reaching to just above the knee. The purpose of this vesture was originally practical, since archdeacons and bishops were presumed to be mobile, riding horses to various parts of a diocese or archdeaconry. In latter years, the clothing took on a more symbolic dimension..

Bahnsen (September 17, 1948 ‚Äì December 11, 1995) was an American Calvinist philosopher, apologist, and debater. He was a minister in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and a full-time Scholar in Residence for the Southern California Center for Christian Studies (SCCCS). He is also considered a contributor to the field of Christian apologetics, as he popularized the presuppositional method of Cornelius Van Til. He is the father of David L. Bahnsen, an American portfolio manager, author, and television commentator, as well as his first born, Jonathan Bahnsen, and youngest, Michael Bahnsen. Early life and education He was the first born of two sons of Robert and Virginia Bahnsen in Auburn, Washington, and grew up in Pico Rivera, California. In youth he was beset by a number of medical difficulties, the most serious of which was a lifelong blood platelet problem that made it difficult for him to stop bleeding. He also had heart trouble which came to light only during his first college admissions medical exam. Raised in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, he actively participated in religious activities. He first began reading the apologetics of Cornelius Van Til when in high school. While attending Westmont College he began writing for the Chalcedon Foundation of Rousas J. Rushdoony and soon came to admire the latter's strong Calvinistic convictions. In 1970 Bahnsen graduated magna cum laude from Westmont College, receiving his B.A. in philosophy as well as the John Bunyan Smith Award for his overall grade point average. From there he went on to Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, where he studied under Cornelius Van Til. The two became close friends. When he graduated in May 1973, he simultaneously received two degrees, Master of Divinity and Master of Theology, as well as the William Benton Greene Prize in apologetics and a Richard Weaver Fellowship from the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. His next academic stop was the University of Southern California (USC), where he studied philosophy, specializing in the theory of knowledge. In 1975, after receiving ordination in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, he became an associate professor of Apologetics and Ethics at Reformed Theological Seminary (RTS) in Jackson, Mississippi. While there, he completed his studies at USC, receiving his Ph.D. in 1978. Bahnsen's four years at RTS were frought with contention, centered around his particular version of theonomic postmillennialism. Later life One of the original pillars of Christian Reconstruction, Bahnsen was a leading proponent of theonomy, postmillennialism, and presuppositional apologetics. He lectured to a broad range of evangelical Christian groups at many colleges and conferences, not only throughout the United States, but in Scotland and Russia. He published numerous articles and has over 1700 audio tapes, videos, articles, and books to his name. Greg Bahnsen's vocal advocacy of Christian Reconstructionism and theonomy was highly controversial during his lifetime, and a public disputation pertaining to theonomy led to his dismissal from the Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi. In addition, he was known for his public debates on apologetics, theonomy, religion (such as Roman Catholicism, Islam, and Judaism), and a variety of socio-political issues (such as abortion, gun control, and homosexuality). Bahnsen is perhaps best known for his debates with such leading atheists as George H. Smith, Gordon Stein, and Edward Tabash. The debate with Stein marked one of the earliest uses of a transcendental argument for the existence of God (TAG). In 1994 a controversy emerged after atheist philosopher Michael Martin was informed just three weeks before a scheduled debate with Bahnsen, \\"that Bahnsen would not debate unless Martin gave written permission to SCCCS to tape the debate\\" for resale to support SCCCS. Martin refused, because \\"he did not want SCCCS to profit from his participation\\", while SCCCS refused to let Bahnsen debate without the debate being taped. The debate was canceled. Since that time Martin has responded to Bahnsen's use of TAG, doing so in his own debates with Michael Butler, John Frame, and Douglas Jones, and has published his \\"Transcendental Argument for the Non-Existence of God\\" in the journal of the New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists, as well as in essays posted on the Secular Web. His debate with Stein was known as \\"The Great Debate (Does God Exist?) Transcript can be found here: http://andynaselli.com/wp-content/uploads/Bahnsen-Stein_Transcript.pdf Death Due to his lifelong medical problems, Bahnsen had to undergo a third aortic valve implant surgery on December 5, 1995. After the completion of the operation, serious complications developed within twenty-four hours. He then became comatose for several days and died on December 11, 1995, at the age of forty-seven.

Stuart Lake, or Nak'albun (\\"Mount Pope Lake\\", ) in the Carrier (Dakelh) language is a lake situated in the Northern Interior of British Columbia, Canada. The town of Fort St. James is situated by the lake near the outlet (Stuart River or Nak'alkoh - ‚Ä≥Mount Pope River‚Ä≥). Stuart Lake is 66 km long, 10 km wide and relatively shallow, with an average depth of 26 m. Stuart Lake offers boating, swimming and sunbathing at sandy beaches, fishing, water skiing, viewing ancient aboriginal pictographs, camping, snowmobiling, ice fishing, ice sailing, and dog sledding. Two provincial park campgrounds, Paarens Beach and Sowchea Bay, are located on the southern shore of the lake, and there are several motels, lodges and private campgrounds in the area. Moorage is available at several marinas. Fort St. James has several lumber mills as do several smaller aboriginal communities in the basin. The lake is usually ice-covered from mid-December to early May. Stuart Lake contains rainbow trout, char or lake trout, whitefish, kokanee, Dolly Varden, and burbot fish.

Stuart Lake is important to British Columbia history, being the location of one of the oldest non-native settlements in the province, Fort St. James. The first non-native to visit the lake was James McDougall in 1806. McDougall's explorations were undertaken as an assistant to Simon Fraser. Fraser and other members of his expedition soon established a North West Company trading post, leaving behind for the winter a garrison led by clerk John Stuart, in whose honor the English name of the lake was given. The original name, in the Dakelh language, is Nak'albun (), literally Mt. Pope Lake, after the mountain that overlooks it, Nak'al (), known in English as Mt. Pope. The changing of names of the lakes reflects the doctrine of discovery upheld by Canada's colonial government as well as the colonial history of the area. The \\"Mayor and Council of the District of Fort St. James unanimously voted to adopt a resolution declaring their opposition to the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project.\\" Their decision was based on concerns for \\"the land base and our fresh water sources. Of particular concern locally is the crossing of the Stuart River, which accommodates one of the largest sockeye salmon runs in the world, and Pitka Creek which flows into Stuart Lake.\\"  Citations   References  Boating the Large Lakes of Northern British Columbia * *Poser, William J.

He served as Governor of New South Wales between 1891 and 1893. Background and education Born at Berkeley Square, London,Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition: Jersey, seventh Earl of (1845‚Äì1915) Lord Jersey was the eldest son of George Child Villiers, 6th Earl of Jersey, and Julia Peel, daughter of Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, Bt. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. He succeeded to the earldom in October 1859, aged 14, on the death of his father, who had only succeeded his father three weeks earlier. He became the principal proprietor of the family banking firm of Child & Co.Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition). New York: St Martin's Press, 1990. Political career Lord Jersey served as a Lord-in- waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) between 1875 and 1877 in the Conservative administration of Benjamin Disraeli. He returned to the government in 1889 when Lord Salisbury made him Paymaster-General, which he remained until 1890. The latter year he was sworn of the Privy Council and made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). In August 1890 Jersey was appointed Governor of New South Wales. He arrived in Australia to take up his position in January 1891. According to the Australian Dictionary of Biography there were no major political difficulties during his term. He was described by Sir Henry Parkes as \\"amiable and well-intentioned\\", but \\"very much occupied with his own family\\". He \\"did not excel as a public speaker\\". He was the official host at the 1891 Australasian National Convention in Sydney. Jersey tendered his resignation already in November 1892 citing pressing business affairs. This did not go down well with the Colonial Office in London. Lord Salisbury thought that Jersey had found that there was \\"less individual power to his office than he imagined\\". Jersey himself wrote to the Colonial Secretary: \\"the duties and responsibilities of a governor can hardly be called serious nowadays being chiefly of a social character\\". He left Australia in March 1893. Lord Jersey represented the United Kingdom at the 1894 Colonial Conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He also acted as New South Wales agent-general in London between 1903 and 1905 and through his ties with the banking institutions helped the state's loan negotiations. He revisited Australia in 1905 and Prime Minister Alfred Deakin considered appointing him Australia's first High Commissioner to London, although nothing came out of this. One of Lord Jersey's godparents was Queen Victoria. The Queen accepted her role as a token of friendship to Robert Peel, Prime Minister, who was Lord Jersey's grandfather (his mother, the 6th Countess, being Julia Peel). Other public appointments On 18 June 1875 the Earl was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st Glamorganshire Artillery Volunteers.Army List. Lord Jersey was Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire from 1877 and from 1885 also served as a Deputy Lieutenant of Warwickshire and as a Justice of the Peace for Warwickshire and Oxfordshire. He was Paymaster-General from 1889 to 1890. In 1894, he was sent to Ottawa to act as the British government's representative to the 1894 Colonial Conference. From 1896 to 1905 he was Chairman of the Light Railway Commission. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1900 Birthday Honours. Freemasonry A Freemason, he was initiated to the craft on 25 October 1865 in the Apollo University Lodge No. 357 at the age of 20. In December 1865 he was passed in the Churchill Lodge No. 478 and in February 1866 he was raised in his mother Lodge. In 1870 he was appointed Senior Grand Warden of the United Grand Lodge of England and served for a year. In 1885 he was appointed Provincial Grand Master of Oxfordshire. When he became Governor of New South Wales, he became a member of the Lodge Ionic No. 65. On 11 June 1891 he was installed Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of New South Wales.

The film seeks, in its author's words to, \\"...shatter the nation's brutalizing silence on matters of sexual and racial difference.\\" To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Teddy Awards, the film was selected to be shown at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016. Content The film blends documentary footage with personal account and poetry in an attempt to depict the specificity of black gay identity. The \\"silence\\" referred to throughout the film is that of black gay men, who are unable to express themselves because of the prejudices of white and black heterosexual society, as well as the white gay society. Riggs brings awareness to the issues Black gay men face. They are excluded from gay communities because these communities are white-centered and fail to understand the intersecting identities of race and sexuality. Riggs experienced this in San Francisco, California within the Castro District, in which he states, ‚ÄúI was immersed in vanilla‚Äù and witnessed the absences of the Black gay image. In addition, Riggs gives examples of media in which Black men are hypersexualized for white sexual pleasure and racistly portrayed Black individuals. Black gay men are placed in a divide because their voices are excluded from these LGBTQIA+ communities, but their bodies are sexualized for white viewing pleasure. Furthermore, Black men are supposed to represent hyper-masculinity, and when Black gay men associate with homosexuality, they are seen as being weak. With their gay identity, however, a Black men is expected to be both hyper-feminine and hyper-masculine. These are the stereotypes and stigmas that oppress Black gay men. In their Black communities, black homophobia is also present. Riggs displays footage of church leaders preaching that gay relationships are an abomination and Black political activists who consider black and gay to be a conflict of loyalties. The narrative structure of Tongues Untied is both interesting and unconventional. Besides including documentary footage detailing North American black gay culture, Riggs also tells of his own experiences as a gay man. These include the realization of his sexual identity and of coping with the deaths of many of his friends to AIDS. Other elements within the film include footage of the Civil Rights Movement and clips of Eddie Murphy performing a homophobic stand-up routine. The documentary dealt with the simultaneous critique of the politics of racism, homophobia and exclusion as they are intertwined with contemporary sexual politics. The film is a part of a body of recently released films and videos, which examine central issues in the lives of lesbian and gay Black people. Riggs‚Äô work challenged television's generic boundaries of conformity during the late 80s and early 90s. The television documentary during this time was the conventional talking head, expert interviews, and personal testimonials commonly on public affair issues. Release and reception At the time of its release, the film was considered controversial because of its frank portrayal of gay sexuality. Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan cited Tongues Untied as an example of how President George H. W. Bush was using taxpayer's money to fund \\"pornographic art\\". In his defense, Riggs stated that, \\"Implicit in the much overworked rhetoric of community standards is the assumption of only one central community (patriarchal, heterosexual and usually white) and only one overarching cultural standard ditto.\\" Controversy over broadcast When Tongues Untied was scheduled to be aired on the POV television series on PBS (and even before it was broadcast), it triggered a national controversy. Along with his own funds, Riggs had financed the documentary with a $5,000 grant from the Western States Regional Arts Fund, a re-granting agency funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, an independent federal agency that provides funding and support for visual, literary, and performing artists. POV also received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts in the amount of $250,000.Deane, Pamela S. \\"Riggs, Marlon: U.S. Filmmaker.\\" The Museum of Broadcast Communications.

News of the film's impending airing sparked a national debate about whether or not it is appropriate for the Federal government of the United States to fund artistic creations that offended some. Reverend Donald E. Wildmon, the president of the American Family Association, attacked PBS and the National Endowment for the Arts for airing Tongues Untied but hoped that the film would be widely seen, because he believed most Americans would find it offensive. \\"This will be the first time millions of Americans will have an opportunity to see the kinds of things their tax money is being spent on,\\" he said. \\"This is the first time there is no third party telling them what is going on; they can see for themselves.\\" Riggs defended the film, saying it was meant to \\"shatter this nation's brutalizing silence on matters of sexual and racial difference.\\" He observed that the widespread attack on PBS and the National Endowment for the Arts in response to the film was predictable, since \\"any public institution caught deviating from their puritanical morality is inexorably blasted as contributing to the nation's social decay.\\" Riggs said, \\"implicit in the much overworked rhetoric about 'community standards' is the assumption of only one central community (patriarchal, heterosexual and usually white) and only one overarching cultural standard to which television programming must necessarily appeal.\\" Riggs stated that ironically, the censorship campaign against Tongues Untied actually brought more publicity to the film than it would have otherwise received and thus enhanced its effectiveness in challenging societal standards regarding depictions of race and sexuality.Riggs, Marlon. \\"Tongues Re-Tied.\\" Resolutions: Contemporary Video Practices. Ed. Michael Renov and Erika Suderburg. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1996. 185-188. Print. Marc Weiss, the executive producer of POV, and Jennnifer Lawson, Vice President for Programming at PBS, vigorously defended the broadcast and, although some public TV stations did not air the film, many stations did, saying it should be available for people who wanted to see it. The broadcast of the film was criticized by several conservative US Senators, who vehemently objected to using taxpayer money to fund what they believed were repulsive artistic works. At the same time, the national broadcast of Tongues Untied was applauded by many who resoundingly defended the work, among them Norman Lear's People for the American Way. In the 1992 Republican presidential primaries, presidential candidate Pat Buchanan cited Tongues Untied as an example of how President George H. W. Bush was investing \\"our tax dollars in pornographic and blasphemous art.\\" Buchanan released an anti-Bush television advertisement for his campaign using re- edited clips from Tongues Untied that violated U.S. Copyright law. The ad was quickly removed from television channels after Riggs successfully demonstrated Buchanan's copyright infringement. Legacy The year 2019 marked the 30th anniversary of the release of Tongues Untied and 25 years since Riggs' death. What began as a single screening quickly became a sensation that swept across the globe, honoring the film that sparked a firestorm. In a nine-day retrospective at Brooklyn Academy of Music, the life and work of Marlon Riggs was celebrated in ‚ÄúRace, Sex & Cinema: The World of Marlon Riggs.‚Äùhttps://www.bam.org/film/2019/race-sex-cinema-the-world-of-marlon-rigg Discussions and panels were led by the likes of Steven Thrasher, Raquel Gates, Yance Ford, Katherine Cheairs, Herman Gray and Steven G.

Charles Stephens of The Counter Narrative Project, was instrumental in bringing Tongues Untied to organizations that support black gay men across the United States and fostering crucial discussions surrounding the film. In May, 2019, the Peabody Awards honored Tongues Untied with a tribute, which Billy Porter of the award- winning FX Channel series Pose presented. He reflected that the film changed his life and gave him his voice at an early age.http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/tongues-untied-tribute New York Times critic-at-large Wesley Morris wrote \\"Tongues Untied is Riggs's unclassifiable scrapbook of black gay male sensibility (a hallucinatory whir of style, memory, psychology)....

She is one of the artists who ushered in the postminimal art movement in the 1960s. Life Hesse was born into a family of observant Jews in Hamburg, Germany, on January 11, 1936.SFMOMA exhibit notes, 2002 for Hamburg; Danto 2006, p.32 for family being observant Jews. When Hesse was two years old in December 1938, her parents, hoping to flee from Nazi Germany, sent Hesse and her older sister, Helen Hesse Charash, to the Netherlands to escape Nazi Germany. They were aboard one of the last Kindertransport trains.Vanessa Corby, After almost six months of separation, the reunited family moved to England and then, in 1939, emigrated to New York City,Lippard 1992, p. 6 and in the Chronology: THE ARTIST'S LIFE, p. 218. where they settled into Manhattan's Washington Heights.Danto 2006, p.32.Lippard 1992, p. 6. In 1944, Hesse's parents separated; her father remarried in 1945 and her mother committed suicide in 1946. In 1962, Hesse met and married sculptor Tom Doyle (1928‚Äì2016); they divorced in 1966. In October 1969, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and she died on May 29, 1970, after three failed operations within a year.Eva Hesse Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Her death at the age of 34 ended a career that would become highly influential, despite spanning only a decade. Career Hesse graduated from New York's School of Industrial Art at the age of 16, and in 1952 she enrolled in the Pratt Institute of Design. She dropped out only a year later. When Hesse was 18, she interned at Seventeen magazine. During this time she also took classes at the Art Students League. From 1954‚Äì57 she studied at Cooper Union and in 1959 she received her BA from Yale University. While at Yale, Hesse studied under Josef Albers and was heavily influenced by Abstract Expressionism.SFMOMA exhibit notes, 2002. After Yale, Hesse returned to New York, where she became friends with many other young minimalist artists, including Sol LeWitt, Donald Judd, Yayoi Kusama, and others. Her close friendship with Sol LeWitt continued until the end of her life. The two frequently wrote to one another, and in 1965 LeWitt famously counseled a young doubting Eva to \\"Stop [thinking] and just DO!\\" Both Hesse and LeWitt went on to become influential artists; their friendship stimulated the artistic development of their work. In November 1961, Eva Hesse married fellow sculptor Tom Doyle. In August 1962, Eva Hesse and Tom Doyle participated in an Allan Kaprow Happening at the Art Students League of New York in Woodstock, New York. There Hesse made her first three- dimensional piece: a costume for the Happening.Lippard 1992, p. 21, 218. In 1963, Eva Hesse had a one-person show of works on paper at the Allan Stone Gallery on New York's Upper East Side.Lippard 1992, p. 219 By 1965 the two had moved to Germany so that Doyle could pursue an artist's residency from German industrialist and collector Friedrich Arnhard Scheidt, a move Hesse was not happy about.Lippard 1992, p. 24. Hesse and Doyle, whose marriage was by then falling apart,Lippard 1992, p. 26 lived and worked in an abandoned textile mill in Kettwig-on-the-Ruhr near Essen for about a year.. The building still contained machine parts, tools, and materials from its previous use and the angular forms of these disused machines and tools served as inspiration for Hesse‚Äôs mechanical drawings and paintings. Her first sculpture was a relief titled Ringaround Arosie, which featured cloth-covered cord, electrical wire, and masonite. This year in Germany marked a turning point in Hesse's career. From here on she would continue to make sculptures, which became the primary focus of her work. Returning to New York City in 1965, she began working and experimenting with the unconventional materials that would become characteristic of her ouptut: latex, fiberglass, and plastic. Repetition 19, III, 1968, fiberglass and polyester resin, 19 units each 19 to 20 1/4\\" (48 to 51 cm) x 11 to 12 3/4\\" (27.8 to 32.2 cm) in diameter, Museum of Modern Art, New York Methods, materials, and processes Hesse's early work (1960‚Äì65) consisted primarily of abstract drawings and paintings. She is better known for her sculptures and because of this, her drawings are often regarded as preliminary steps to her later work. However, she created most of her drawings as a separate body of work. She stated, \\"they were related because they were mine but they weren‚Äôt related in one completing the other.\\" Hesse‚Äôs interest in latex as a medium for sculptural forms had to do with immediacy. Art critic John Keats stated: \\"immediacy may be one of the prime reasons Hesse was attracted to latex\\". Hesse‚Äôs first two works using latex, Schema and Sequel (1967‚Äì68), use latex in a way never imagined by the manufacturer. In her artwork Untitled (Rope Piece), Hesse employed industrial latex and once it was hardened, she hung it on the wall and ceiling using wire.\\"Industrial latex was meant for casting. Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was smooth yet irregular, ragged at the edges like deckled paper.\\" Hesse's work often employs multiple forms of similar shapes organized together in grid structures or clusters. Retaining some of the defining forms of minimalism, modularity, and the use of unconventional materials, she created eccentric work that was repetitive and labor-intensive. Her work Contingent from 1968 is an ideal example of this concept. And in a statement on her work, Hesse described her piece entitled Hang-Up as \\"...the first time my idea of absurdity or extreme feeling came through...The whole thing is absolutely rigid, neat cord around the entire thing . . . It is extreme and that is why I like it and don't like it . . . It is the most ridiculous structure that I ever made and that is why it is really good\\". Postminimalism and feminism Eva Hesse is associated with the Postminimal art movement. Arthur Danto distinguished post-minimalism from minimalism by its \\"mirth and jokiness,\\" its \\"unmistakable whiff of eroticism,\\" and its \\"nonmechanical repetition.\\"Danto, 2006, p. 33. She worked and sometimes competed with her male counterparts in post-minimalist art, a primarily male- dominated movement. Many feminist art historians have noted how her work successfully illuminates women‚Äôs issues while refraining from any obvious political agenda. She revealed, in a letter to Ethelyn Honig (1965), that a woman is \\"at disadvantage from the beginning‚Ä¶ She lacks conviction that she has the ‚Äòright‚Äô to achievement. She also lacks the belief that her achievements are worthy‚Äù. She continued to explain that, ‚Äúa fantastic strength is necessary and courage. I dwell on this all the time. My determination and will are strong but I am lacking so in self-esteem that I never seem to overcome.‚Äù She denied her work was strictly feminist, defending it as feminine but without feminist statements in mind. In an interview with Cindy Nemser for Woman's Art Journal (1970), she stated, \\"The way to beat discrimination in art is by art. Excellence has no sex.\\" Visual and critical analysis Hesse's work often shows minimal physical manipulation of a material while simultaneously completely transforming the meaning it conveys. This simplicity and complexity has evoked controversy among art historians. Debate has focussed on which pieces should be considered complete and finished works, and which are studies, sketches, or models for future works. Hesse's drawings have often been noted as drafts for later sculptures, but Hesse herself disavowed any strong connection. Her work is often described as anti-form, i.e. a resistance to uniformity. Her work embodies elements of minimalism in its simple shapes, delicate lines, and limited color palette. Barry Schwabsky described her work for the Camden Arts Centre in London: \\"Things folded, things piled, things twisted, things wound and unwound; tangled things, blunt things to connect to; materials that have a congealed look, materials that seem lost or discarded or mistreated; shapes that look like they should have been made of flesh and shapes, that look like they might be made of flesh but should not have been ‚Äì you can look at these things, these materials, these shapes, and feel the shudder of an unnamable nanosensation, or you can let your eye pass by them without reaction; maybe you can do both at once.\\" All of her work, and especially her drawings, are based on repetition and simple progressions. Preservation of artworks There has been ongoing discussion about how best to preserve Eva Hesse‚Äôs sculptures. With the exception of fiberglass, most of her favored materials have aged badly, so much of her work presents conservators with an enormous challenge. Arthur Danto, writing of the Jewish Museum's 2006 retrospective, refers to \\"the discolorations, the slackness in the membrane-like latex, the palpable aging of the material‚Ä¶ Yet, somehow the work does not feel tragic. Instead, it is full of life, of eros, even of comedy‚Ä¶ Each piece in the show vibrates with originality and mischief.\\"Danto, 2006, p.30‚Äì31. In some cases, her work is damaged beyond presentation. For instance, Sans III can no longer be exhibited to the public because the latex boxes have curled in on themselves and crumbled. Hesse‚Äôs close friend Sol LeWitt argued for steps for active conservation, \\"She wanted her work to last ... She certainly didn't have the attitude that she would mutely sit by and let it disintegrate before her eyes.\\"Keats, John. \\"The Afterlife of Eva Hesse.\\" Art & Antiques Magazine. Art & Antiques Magazine, March 31, 2011; accessed March 4, 2015. LeWitt's response is supported by many of Hesse‚Äôs other friends and colleagues. However, Hesse‚Äôs dedication to material and process contradicts her intention for these works to attain permanency. When discussing this topic with collectors in mind, she wrote, \\"At this point, I feel a little guilty when people want to buy it. I think they know but I want to write them a letter and say it's not going to last. I am not sure what my stand on lasting really is. Part of me feels that it‚Äôs superfluous and if I need to use rubber that is more important. Life doesn‚Äôt last; art doesn't last.\\" Legacy Her art is often viewed in the context of the many struggles of her life. This includes escaping from the Nazis, her parents' divorce, the suicide of her mother when she was 10, her failed marriage, and the death of her father. A 2016 documentary entitled Eva Hesse, premiered in New York, illustrated her painful background. Directed by Marcie Begleiter, the film tells the story of Hesse's \\"tragically foreshortened life\\". It \\"focuses on those years of artistic emergence, a period of rapid development and furious productivity, with few parallels in the history of art.\\" While experiences no doubt had profound impressions on Hesse, the true impact of her artwork has been her formal, artistic invention: for example, her inventive uses of material, her contemporary response to the minimalist movement, and her ability to usher in the postmodern and postminimalist art movements. Arthur Danto connects the two by describing her as \\"cop[ing] with emotional chaos by reinventing sculpture through aesthetic insubordination, playing with worthless material amid the industrial ruins of a defeated nation that, only two decades earlier, would have murdered her without a second thought.\\" Hesse was among the first artists of the 1960s to experiment with the fluid contours of the organic world of nature, as well as the simplest of artistic gestures. Some observers see in these qualities latent, proto- feminist references to the female body; others find in Hesse's languid forms expressions of wit, whimsy, and a sense of spontaneous invention with casually found, or \\"everyday\\" materials. Prominent artists that have noted her as a primary influence include Japanese artist Eiji Sumi http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/292461/ Exhibitions In 1961, Hesse's gouache paintings were exhibited in Brooklyn Museum‚Äôs 21st International Watercolor Biennial. Simultaneously, she showed her drawings in the John Heller Gallery exhibition Drawings: Three Young Americans. In August 1962, she and Tom Doyle participated in an Allan Kaprow Happening at the Art Students League of New York in Woodstock, New York. In 1963, Hesse had a one-person show of works on paper at the Allan Stone Gallery on New York's Upper East Side.Lippard 1992, p. 219 Her first solo show of sculpture was presented at the Kunstverein f√ºr die Rheinlande und Westfalen, D√ºsseldorf, in 1965. In November 1968, she exhibited her large-scale sculptures at the Fischbach Gallery in New York. The exhibition was titled Chain Polymers and was her only solo sculpture exhibition during her lifetime in the United States.Sussman and Wasserman, Preface The exhibition was pivotal in Hesse's career, securing her reputation at the time. Her large piece Expanded Expansion showed at the Whitney Museum in the 1969 exhibit \\"Anti-Illusion: Process/Materials\\".Danto, 2006, p.30. There have been dozens of major posthumous exhibitions in the United States and Europe. An early one was at the Guggenheim Museum (1972),Lippard 1992, pp. 5, 128‚Äì29, 138, 180‚Äì82. while in 1979, three separate iterations of an Eva Hesse retrospective were held, entitled Eva Hesse: Sculpture. These exhibitions took place at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London from May 4 ‚Äì June 17, 1979; the Kroller-Muller in Otterlo from June 30 ‚Äì August 5, 1979; and the Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hannover from August 17 ‚Äì September 23, 1979. One artwork featured in the exhibition was Aught, four double sheets of latex stuffed with polyethylene.[Artforum, Summer 1979. Page 6] In 1982, Ellen H. Johnson organized the first retrospective dedicated entirely to Hesse's drawings, which traveled to the Grey Art Gallery at NYU, the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, and the Baltimore Museum of Art. In 1992 and 1993, retrospective exhibitions were held in New Haven, Valencia and Paris. Numerous major exhibitions have been organized since the early 2000s, including a major show in 2002 (organized jointly between the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern and Museum Wiesbaden), and concurrent exhibitions in 2006 at The Drawing Center in New York and the Jewish Museum of New York. In Europe, Hesse had recent exhibitions at the Fundaci√≥ Antoni T√†pies in Barcelona (2010) and at the Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh (August to October 2009). An exhibition of her drawings from the collection of the Allen Memorial Art Museum will travel in 2019-20 to the Museum Wiesbaden, Mumok in Vienna, Hauser & Wirth New York, and the Allen Memorial Art Museum.  Collections  Over 20 of her works feature in the Museum of Modern Art, in New York. The largest collection of Hesse's work outside of the United States is in Museum Wiesbaden, which started actively acquiring her work after the 1990 exhibition \\"Female Artists of the Twentieth Century.\\"Information booklet of Museum Wiesbaden One of the largest collections of Hesse's drawings is in the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College, which also maintains the Eva Hesse Archive, donated to the museum by the artist's sister, Helen Hesse Charash, in 1977.

The \\"diamond\\" in their name is due to both their clarity and natural faceting - crystals possess double termination points and 18 total faces (six on each point, six around the center). Because the first discovery sites were in the village of Middleville and in the city of Little Falls, respectively, the crystal is also known as a Middleville diamond or a Little Falls diamond.Mindat with locations Herkimer diamonds became widely recognized after workmen discovered them in large quantities while cutting into the Mohawk River Valley dolomite in the late 18th century. Geologists discovered exposed dolomite in Herkimer County outcroppings and began mining there, leading to the \\"Herkimer diamond\\" moniker. Double-point quartz crystals may be found in sites around the world, but only those mined in Herkimer County can be given this name. Process of formation The geologic history of these crystals began about 500 million years ago in a shallow sea which was receiving sediments from the ancient Adirondack Mountains to the north. The calcium and magnesium carbonate sediments accumulated and lithified to form the dolomite bedrock currently known as the Little Falls Formation and formerly as the Little Falls Dolostone.Herkimer Diamonds, MAGS Explorer, V. 2 No. 7, pp. 1-3, July 11, 2003 While buried, cavities were formed by acidic waters forming the vugs in which the quartz crystals formed. While the dolomite unit is Cambrian in age, the quartz within the vugs is interpreted to have formed during the Carboniferous Period.Muskatt, H.S., and Tollerton, V.P., Jr., 1992, The Little Falls Dolostone (Late Cambrian); stratigraphy and mineralogy, IN April, R.H., ed., Field trip guidebook: New York State Geological Association Guidebook, 64th annual meeting, Hamilton, NY, September 18-20, 1992, no. 64, p. 200-215 as quoted in GEOLEX, USGS Waxy organic material, silicon dioxide and pyrite (iron sulfide) was present as minor constituents of rock made of dolomite and calcite. As sediment buried the rock and temperatures rose, crystals grew in the cavities very slowly, resulting in quartz crystals of exceptional clarity. Inclusions can be found in these crystals that provide clues to the origins of the Herkimer diamonds. Found within the inclusions are solids, liquids (salt water or petroleum), gases (most often carbon dioxide), two- and three-phase inclusions, and negative (uniaxial) crystals. A black hydrocarbon is the most common solid inclusion.https://www.herkimerhistory.com/Hydrocarbon.html  See also  * Cape May diamonds, another form of quartz referred to as \\"diamonds\\" References External links *Website for the New York State Academy of Mineralogy *Prospecting for Herkimer Diamonds *HerkimerHistory.com *Video of mining for Herkimer Diamonds with a jackhammer *Book Review: Collector‚Äôs Guide to Herkimer Diamonds Category:Quartz varieties Diamond ","title":"Herkimer diamond"},{"id":"2508435","text":"Margaret Jones (21 June 1934 ‚Äì 2 December 2009) was an English actress, best known for playing Blanche Hunt in the British soap opera Coronation Street, a role which she first portrayed in 1974 and played regularly from the late-1990s until shortly before her death. She won the British Soap Award for Best Comedy Performance in 2005 and 2008. Career Jones graduated from the drama school RADA and performed in numerous plays including Pride and Prejudice and The Women on the West End stage. Her first television role came in 1961 when she appeared in one episode of Coronation Street as a policewoman. Jones's first major television role was in BBC's 1967 adaptation of The Forsyte Saga. Jones played the maid, Smither, a small but recurring part. Later , she appeared twice in Nearest and Dearest . Prior to playing Blanche Hunt in Coronation Street her best-known role was as Polly Barraclough in Sam with Mark McManus and she also appeared in the 1971 BBC miniseries adaption of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, In 1967, several years after her first Coronation Street role she had another guest role on the opposite side of the law, as a shoplifter. In 1974, she made her first appearance as Blanche Hunt, the mother of Deirdre. The part had originally been played by Patricia Cutts, who committed suicide after appearing in only two episodes. Jones, who had previously auditioned for the role, accepted an offer to take over the part at short notice as storylines had already been written for Blanche. Jones remained a regular cast member until 1976. She re-appeared in the show briefly when Blanche's grandchild Tracy was born in 1977, when Deirdre's marriage to Ray Langton collapsed in 1978 and when Deirdre married Ken Barlow in 1981. Throughout the 1980s, Jones was a regular face on British television, appearing in several series. These included The Barchester Chronicles, The Beiderbecke Tapes, In Sickness and in Health, Sharon and Elsie, We'll Think Of Something, The Nesbitts Are Coming, Bulman and Lovely Couple, alongside Pauline Quirke. After guest appearances in shows such as Dalziel and Pascoe, Goodnight Sweetheart, Heartbeat and Peak Practice in the 1990s, Jones reprised the role of Blanche Hunt in Coronation Street in 1996. She became a regular cast member again in 1999. Blanche's trademark withering one-liners and no-nonsense attitude made her a firm favourite of fans of the long-running show. In 2005 and 2008, Jones won the British Soap Award for Best Comedy Performance. Jones stated that she didn't think of her character as funny and that she couldn't play her properly if she did. Personal life Jones was a Roman Catholic. She married lawyer John Oliver Stansfield in 1971; he died in January 1999 aged 72 in Westminster, London.Deaths England and Wales 1984‚Äì2006 Illness On 18 April 2008, Jones fell, injuring her knee and shoulder at the Manchester hotel in which she stayed while filming Coronation Street. She took two weeks off work on Coronation Street to recover from the accident. She was written out of the series again when she fell ill in October 2009.  Death  In October 2009, Jones was admitted to Salford Royal Hospital in Salford, Greater Manchester, for undisclosed major surgery; she was reported to be making a slow and steady recovery. However, her condition later deteriorated, and she remained in the same hospital until she died peacefully in her sleep on the morning of 2 December 2009. She was survived by her sister Joan. Her final appearance as Blanche was broadcast posthumously on 11 December 2009. Jones's funeral was held at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Clerkenwell, London on 15 December 2009. A memorial service for Jones took place at Salford Cathedral on 25 February 2010. Tributes came from Coronation Street co-stars William Roache, Anne Kirkbride, Sue Nicholls, Craig Gazey and Brooke Vincent.

Approximately 300 volunteers are annually placed in year-long and summer programs, with more than 7,500 placed to date. World Teach Founded in 1986 by a group of Harvard University students, including prize-winning economist Michael Kremer.  Programs  All volunteers for year-long programs must be enrolled in or have completed four year college programs, with most volunteers being recent graduates.Teach for the World, The New York Times Most volunteers teach English, and some teach information technology, mathematics, science, accounting, and HIV/AIDS education. Typically WorldTeach partners with Ministries of Education, who identify the needs that WorldTeach volunteers can help them address. Volunteer placements vary widely in the size of the community (300 people to 7 million), age of the students (elementary to adult), and living situation (homestay or apartment). Like the Peace Corps, volunteers may go to a wide range of countries, and WorldTeach volunteers apply to and are accepted to particular country placements. Lessons learned from WorldTeach, Harvard Gazette WorldTeach currently has year-long programs in American Samoa, Ecuador,CEC-EPN WorldTeach in Quito, Ecuador the Marshall Islands, Namibia, Thailand, and Vietnam. For year-long programs, which require a four-year college degree, costs are shared between the hosting educational organization and WorldTeach volunteers. Included are housing placements, visa sponsorship, health and emergency evacuation insurance, 24-hour field staff support, three-four weeks of in-country orientation (including language and teacher training) and a monthly stipend roughly equal to a local teacher's salary. Summer programs are in Ecuador, India, Morocco, Namibia, and South Africa. Volunteers need not have a college degree, although most are current college students. These programs are not funded by WorldTeach's in-country partners and students usually pay for them through scholarships, out-of- pocket, or obtain college credit.New York Times, A Year Abroad - WorldTeach.

Power Wheels is a brand of battery-powered ride-on toy cars for kids ages 12 months to seven years old. Power Wheels ride-ons are built with kid-sized, realistic features ‚Äì in some cases, real working features like FM radios, opening/closing doors and hoods, and both forward and reverse motion.  History  The Power Wheels brand name dates back to 1984, when San Francisco-based toy company Kransco acquired Pines of America, makers of battery-powered vehicles for children. Two years later, Kransco renamed the line \\"Power Wheels\\". By 1990 sales of the battery-powered vehicles reached over 1,000,000 per year. In 1994, the Power Wheels Line was purchased by Mattel, who placed it under their Fisher-Price subsidiary. With the addition of new vehicle licenses the new Power Wheels lines did well. In 1999, Fisher- Price announced the Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Ride-On ‚Äì which contributed to a year of record sales for the entire product line.  Power Wheels vehicles  Power Wheels ride-on cars, trucks and motorcycles have been sold with more than 100 model names. The latest line of Power Wheels features small scale versions of popular real world vehicles, including the Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Hurricane, Ford F-150, Ford Mustang, Kawasaki KFX quad, Harley-Davidson motorcycle, Cadillac Escalade EXT as well as Lightning McQueen from the Pixar‚Äôs film Cars, and a Thomas the Tank Engine with a circle of track.  Safety recalls  Power Wheels vehicles have been the subject of safety recalls. The first recall in 1991 involved the 18 Volt Porsche 911, in which the contacts in the foot pedal switch could weld together in use. If this were to happen, the motor would remain running and the vehicle would continue moving forward, unable to stop. A new accelerator pedal was fitted that eliminated the possibility of welded contacts. In 1998, Fisher-Price undertook a monumental recall of up to 10 million Power Wheels 12 volt and Super 6 volt vehicles manufactured since 1986. The recall and repair program was conducted to replace battery fuses and strengthen battery connectors in order to prevent the units from overheating. The main difference of a post recall Power Wheel is that the original \\"H\\" (or on very early Power Wheels, \\"S\\") connectors are removed and replaced with the larger, black \\"A\\" connectors. If a Power Wheels ride-on was built in or before 1998 and has the Black \\"A\\" connectors, then the recall work has probably been performed. The third recall in 2000 involved the Harley-Davidson motor cycle ride-ons, In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Fisher-Price recalled about 218,000 battery- powered Power Wheels Harley-Davidson motorcycle ride-ons for repair. The foot pedals, which activate the ride-ons, could stick in the \\"on\\" position. The fourth recall in 2019 involved the Barbie Dream Camper model FRC29 with the grey foot pedal, due to fall hazards and a pedal issue that causes the ride-on to keep moving when the pedal was released.

A view of the ancient cryptoporticus of Sessa Aurunca, Italy In Ancient Roman architecture a cryptoporticus (from Greek crypta and porticus) is a covered corridor or passageway. The usual English is \\"cryptoportico\\". The cryptoportico is a semi- subterranean gallery whose vaulting supports portico structures aboveground and which is lit from openings at the tops of its arches. On sloping sites the open side of a cryptoporticus is often partially at ground level and supports a structure such as a forum or Roman villa, in which case it served as basis villae. It is often vaulted and lit by openings in the vault. In the letters of Pliny the Younger,Pliny, Epistles ii.17.16ff; v.6.27-28; vii.21.2;ix.36.3. the term is used as a synonym of crypt. The shade and semi-excavated site of a cryptoportico provided cool and moderated temperatures useful for storage of perishables, while it offered a level and slightly raised podium for the superstructure.  Examples  = Coimbra = The cryptoporticus of Coimbra, the old Roman city of Aeminium, was built to create an artificial platform over which the city's Forum Page could be built. Later, the Bishop's Palace (still standing today as Machado de Castro National Museum) was built using the platform that could have been created by the structure thus preserving it in perfect condition. = Arles = The cryptoporticus of Arles, dating from the 1st century BC was built as foundation for the forum, which has since been replaced by the Chapel of the Jesuit College and the City Hall. Three double, parallel tunnels arranged in the form of a U are supported by fifty piers. Masons' marks on the stonework indicate that it was built by Greeks, probably from Marseille. Similar structures in Narbonne, Reims, and Bavay were used as granaries. The cryptoporticus at Arles is, however, too damp for prolonged storage and may have served as a barracks for public slaves. The cryptoporticus of Arles is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with other Roman buildings of the city, as part of the Arles, Roman and Romanesque Monuments group. = Reims = The cryptoporticus of Reims, formerly enclosing three sides of the forum, is of Gallo-Roman origin and was probably built during the 3rd century. Today, only its Eastern part remains, but this is unusually well preserved for a Gallo-Roman structure. = Other places = Other well-known examples include the cryptoporticus of Hadrian's Villa and that of the House of the Cryptoporticus in Pompeii. A well-preserved cryptoporticus is also located at the Papal Summer Residence in Castel Gandolfo, Italy. In Rome, a cryptoporticus is located in the Catacomb of Priscilla, a remnant from a large Roman villa.

It forms part of Guadeloupe, an overseas region of France. Geography and geology The island of La D√©sirade is located at the eastern end of Guadeloupe island group, in the Lesser Antilles. It lies about 8 km off the coast of Grande-Terre, which is the eastern half of the island of Guadeloupe. Its coordinates are . The island is 11 km long and 2 km wide; the interior of the island forms a central plateau.Sullivan, Lynne M. Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominica & St. Lucia, Hunter Publishing Inc., , p. 345 It has a land area of and a population of 1,595 in 2006, with a population density of 77 inh. per km¬≤ (200 inh. per sq. mile) in 2006. Most residents live in the settlement of Beaus√©jour (formerly known as Grande-Anse). Geologically speaking, La D√©sirade is the oldest island in the Lesser Antilles with its most ancient rocks, at 145 million years old,http://www.guadeloupensites.com/desirade.php being found at the easternmost point of the island. The beach at Pointe Doubl√© is frequently visited by geologists who come to examine the basalt and composite rocks, which give the area its striking multi-coloured appearance. The island has its own lapidary, which transforms the rocks found on the island into jewellery and souvenirs. Administration The island of La D√©sirade is part of the French West Indies. It forms part of the department of Guadeloupe, which is one of the overseas departments and territories of France. Local administration is carried out by the local commune (municipality). The commune of La D√©sirade also includes the uninhabited Petite Terre Islands which lie nearby. Main settlements View of La D√©sirade from the east coast of Grande-Terre, Guadeloupe, showing the central plateau of La D√©sirade. Beaus√©jour Iguana Delicatissima =Beaus√©jour= The main settlement on the island is the village of Beaus√©jour, which has a post office, a library, several grocery stores and restaurants, as also the community's church, which is famous for its altar carved out of locally grown pear tree wood. The central square of the village is named ‚ÄòLa Place du Maire mendiant‚Äô (‚ÄòThe begging Mayor‚Äôs square‚Äô), in memory of a beloved local figure. The ‚Äòbegging Mayor‚Äô was the nickname given to a former Mayor, Joseph Daney de Marcillac, who, after a terrible fire had destroyed most of the village in 1922, went from door to door in Guadeloupe begging for funds and building materials in order to rebuild the two primary schools of the village.http://www.guadeloupe- fr.com/magazinedestinationguadeloupe/article=25771/ Close to the square, one can find a statue of the French abolitionist Victor Sch≈ìlcher, as also a monument in memory of the fishermen who perished at sea and the town hall, built in the style of architect Ali Tur. =Anse de Galets= This small bay is situated at the westernmost tip of the island, facing the Pointe des ch√¢teaux. Providing the departure point for the colonisation of the island, this cove was also home to all those who were exiled in the 18th Century.Gwadloup Natures, Desirade Natures, History Archaeological evidence has been discovered that suggests that an Amerindian population lived on La D√©sirade from the 3rd to the 16th centuries. Christopher Columbus was the first European to find La D√©sirade, this event occurred in 1493 on his second voyage to the region. In subsequent years, the island became known as a hiding place for pirates and eventually became site of a leper colony which was terminated in 1958. The western end of the island was used as a place of banishment for offenders of Grande-Terre and for some metropolitan nobles. Culture =Festivals= The annual Sailors‚Äô Commemorative Ceremony is held on 16 August. A large procession is taken out, in which the ‚ÄòLe V√©t√©ran‚Äô, a model boat normally kept in the town's church (Notre Dame de l‚ÄôAssomption), is paraded all around Beaus√©jour. Though the ceremony itself is only for a day, the days leading up to and following it are normally festive too, with parades and parties. People from all over Guadeloupe and France come over to the island to partake in the event. Every year the \\"Goat Festival\\" (F√™te du Cabri) takes place during the Easter weekend. Based around a celebration of the island's favourite food, various concerts, productions and programmes are held across the isle. =Cuisine= The island is renowned for its fresh seafood, much of which goes straight from the fishing boats to the local restaurants. Furthermore, the lobsters and shellfish which are plentiful on D√©sirade are becoming increasingly rare in Guadeloupe as a whole. There are also many traditional goat recipes, including curries and stews, which make up a large part of the island's cuisine. As for desserts, the cashew fruit is a particular speciality which can be consumed on its own, with ice-cream or in rum-based drinks. Flora and fauna The island is in pristine condition, and is partly under the R√©serve naturelle nationale de La D√©sirade. It provides a good opportunity to see varied and often rare wildlife. While the arid soil on La Montagne's plateau does not permit cultivation beyond subsistence level, the natural vegetation is amazingly rich and varied. Some of the plant species found are the ga√Øac (Guaiacum officinale), the mapou (Myrsine australis) and the cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale), as well as a protected species of cacti called the \\"t√™te √† l‚ÄôAnglais\\" (in reference to its similarity to the Queen's Guards‚Äô bearskin hats). This same region is also inhabited by rare animal species such as a type of robin called a ‚Äòbicloitin‚Äô, a tropical rodent with glossy brown, orange fur named an ‚Äòagouti‚Äô and the Lesser Antillean iguana. The two islets of Petite Terre (Terre de Bas, the larger of the two, and Terre de Haut) were designated as a natural reserve in 1998. The two islets are separated by a lagoon 200 yards across and are located about seven miles from D√©sirade, to which they belong administratively. In 1974 the lighthouse keeper and his family, the last residents, left Petite Terre due to the automation of the lighthouse. In earlier times, as many as 50 inhabitants lived on the islets. Today this tiny archipelago, surrounded by clear waters and huge coral reefs is inhabited by iguanas (Iguana delicatissima), which are native to the Lesser Antilles. Petite Terre is home to rare species of birds such as the Least Tern (Sternula antillarum), the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus), as well as various types of sandpipers. Two species of turtle, the Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta caretta), come to the islets to lay their eggs.

He built speedboats for the Shah of Iran, Charles Keating, Robert Vesco, Malcolm Forbes, and George H. W. Bush. Retired President Lyndon Johnson owned several 16 ft. Donzi speedboats on his Texas ranch with which he would race his Secret Service agents. Early life and education Aronow was born in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn,\\"How a Kid From Brooklyn Put Go-Fast Boats On The Map\\" By Capt Ken Kreisler Power & Motor July 2000 the youngest son of Russian-Jewish immigrants\\"Don Aronow's Murder Leaves Miami Wondering: Were 'Cigarettes' Hazardous to His Health?\\", Joshua Hammer, People March 30, 1987 Herman and Ruth Aronow. He had two elder sisters, Sylvia and Lillian. His father owned a gas station and then a taxi company which collapsed during the Great Depression. He graduated a top athlete from James Madison High School in 1944, worked as a life guard at Coney Island, and enrolled at Brooklyn College. In 1945, he joined the merchant marine and worked overseas until the end of World War II. In 1947, he returned to the USA and completed his studies graduating from Brooklyn College in 1948 with a physical education degree earning letters in football, wrestling, and track. Career After school, he worked as a physical education teacher for a time until he accepted a job at his father- in-law's southern New Jersey construction business which was booming thanks to demand from returning World War II veterans. In 1953, he established his own construction company, the Aronow Corporation which quickly became one of the largest construction companies in the state. In 1959, at age of 32, the now- millionaire Aronow moved to Miami with his family, where he began racing boats as a hobby. The hobby evolved into a business and by the end of 1962, he had formed the Formula Marine boat company, which he then sold to Merrick Lewis' Alliance Machine Corp out of Dayton, Ohio. In 1964 he started Donzi Marine made the Donzi brand an international success and quickly sold the company to Teleflex Inc. in mid 1965. In 1966, he founded Magnum Marine and in 1967 proceeded to win his first World Championship driving two 27' Magnums, a single engine inboard and a triple engine Mercury powered outboard. Since he was not supposed to be building boats in 1969, according to his non-compete clause following the sale of Magnum Marine, Aronow built the first Cigarette boat under the name Cary, with the help of Elton Cary's Miami Beach facility. After campaigning his boat \\"The Cigarette\\" around the world with mechanic Norris \\"Knocky\\" House as his cockpit companion, he won his second World Championship in three years, and third consecutive United States Championship while becoming only the 2nd American in history to win the UIM Gold Medal of Honor (Gar Wood was America's first UIM champion). Once Aronow was able to formally open his new company, he started Cigarette Racing Team using his own designs in 1970. Having sold Cigarette for the last time in 1982 (after having sold it and purchasing it back in the late 1970s while merging it with his own Squadron Marine), he formed USA Racing Team and built the Blue Thunders, 39-foot catamarans used by the United States Customs Service to patrol U.S. waters and run down illegal offshore activities, especially drug smuggling. Aronow's close friend at the time, Vice President George Bush, was a former Cigarette owner and was involved in testing out the 39-foot cats prior to government approval. Aronow's boats won over 350 offshore races and he was a two-time world champion and three-time U.S. champion. He has been elected to every powerboating Hall of Fame in existence and as stated above, he and Gar Wood were the only two Americans to have ever received the UIM Gold Medal of Honor. Murder The great speed of Cigarette boats also made them a popular choice among cocaine smugglers. On February 3, 1987, Aronow was murdered in his car at the end of 188th Street in Miami where his boat companies operated. Aronow had just left a meeting with Bob Saccenti, part owner of Apache Power Boats together with partner Ben Kramer. Witnesses said that a powder blue Lincoln pulled next to Aronow's car from the opposite direction, and when Aronow rolled down its window the driver opened fire. Another witness tried to follow the Lincoln as it fled but could not catch the killer(s). The Lincoln drove over the grass to get away. Nearly a decade later, two men pleaded no contest to charges related to Aronow's killing. In 1995, career criminal Bobby Young admitted to shooting Aronow and pleaded no contest to second degree murder, eventually providing a full confession in 2009 shortly before his death. Ben Kramer, winner of the 1986 American Power Boat Association Offshore Championship, pleaded no contest to manslaughter in 1996. Kramer had a business dispute with Aronow after buying the latter's USA Racing Team but was forced to sell it back to Aronow after the Customs Service refused to do business with him. Kramer was already in prison on a life sentence with no possibility of parole following 1988 and 1989 convictions for drug smuggling and gun charges, as well as receiving a 1990 conviction for a failed escape attempt by helicopter from a federal prison near Miami. The story was also the basis for the 2009 documentary film Thunder Man: The Don Aronow Story and the 2018 movie Speed Kills with John Travolta. Personal life Aronow married twice. *In 1948, he married Shirley Goldin\\"Master Of Those Mad Racers - Don Aronow hurts a little, but as the world's top ocean powerboat driver and builder he is never bored\\", Jerry Kirshenbaum, Sports Illustrated November 17, 1969 who he had met while working as a lifeguard on Coney Island.

The Koga lineage was classified as kuge prior to the Meiji Restoration, then as a kazoku lineage. Name The name Koga is composed of the kanji meaning 'long time' (‰πÖ) and 'I/self' (Êàë). 'Koga' is the on'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) of the kanji, while 'hisashƒ´ ware' would be the kun'yomi (native Japanese reading). But actually ‰πÖÊàë is the ateji (ÂΩì„Å¶Â≠ó; phonetic-equivalent cv characters) for Èô∏ (koga; an obsolete word for land). The name is recorded as having originated with the grandfather of the family's founder, Chancellor of the Realm Minamoto no Morofusa (:ja:Ê∫êÂ∏´Êàø), who owned a manor in the south-western suburbs of Kyoto at Koga (modern Fushimi-ku). As a result, he was referred to as the Koga-Chancellor.Okano 2002, p.10 After the family's apparent founding, however, neither Minamoto no Masazane's (:ja:Ê∫êÈõÖÂÆü) son nor his great-grandson were referred to by the name Koga. Strictly speaking, therefore, the 'Koga family' refers to the lineage descended from Minamoto no Masazane's great-great-grandson, Koga Michiteru, whereas those before should be considered as members of the Nakanoin section of the Murakami Genji branch of the Minamoto clan.Okano 2002, pp.11‚Äì12. Overview The emblem of the Koga is an artistic representation of the roxanne Autumn Bellflower (Gentiana scabra var. buergeri). During the Meiji Restoration, the head of the Koga family was given the title of marquis (‰æØÁàµ k≈çshaku) as part of the kazoku, the hereditary peerage that combined the kuge and the daimy≈ç. One of the responsibilities of the Koga family was to be the protectors of the courtesan guild at court.Japan: A Short Cultural History, p.362, G. B. Sansom, 1931 The Koga family was highly regarded as one of the most successful clans throughout the Meiji period. There is still a Shinto shrine named Koga jinja (‰πÖÊàëÁ•ûÁ§æ) in Fushimi district, Kyoto City. The present master, Tomomichi Koga (‰πÖÊàëË™†ÈÄö), is the owner of an art salon in Tokyo.

The EP featured four non-album tracks. It was issued on 29 November 1985, two weeks after another EP, Tiny Dynamine. The two EP sets, which featured complementary artwork, were also released as a combined double EP in a gatefold cover, and as an eight-track CD. The EP was reissued in 1991 as part of The Box Set and in 2005 as part of the singles/EP collection Lullabies to Violaine. A new vinyl version, sourced from digital files created from a new transfer of the original analogue tapes, was released in 2015, combined with the Tiny Dynamine EP. Background The band did not originally intend to release these songs to the general public, presumably explaining the decision to release the material on EPs, rather than as what would have been their fourth album. The tracks on Tiny Dynamine and Echoes in a Shallow Bay were initially recorded to test the production capacities of a new studio. When the band decided the material was strong enough for release, they completed the recording process and issued the finished product on two EPs. \\"Pale Clouded White\\" was performed live. A remastered version of the song appeared on the 2000 compilation Stars and Topsoil. Several of the titles on the two EPs have some link with Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). The great spangled fritillary is a butterfly, and while there is no pale clouded white, there is a pale clouded yellow (as well as several groups of butterflies commonly known as whites), while mellonella is the specific name of the wax moth Galleria mellonella. The lyrics of this track consist of Fraser reciting the scientific names of the families of British moths. Lepidoptera eggs do not have shells, though.

He was the son of George Child-Villiers, 8th Earl of Jersey and gave one of the family seats, Osterley Park, to the British nation in the late 1940s. Marriages and children His first wife was Patricia Richards (20 January 1914 ‚Äì 27 January 2017). They married on 12 January 1932, and were divorced in 1937. They had one child: # Lady Caroline Child-Villiers (b. 9 April 1934), now Lady Caroline Ogilvy, married firstly Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 6th Earl of Minto, and had children. She married secondly on 23 September 1969 John Douglas Stuart, and married thirdly in 1980 The Hon. James Donald Diarmid Ogilvy, son of David Lyulph Gore Wolseley Ogilvy. She had no children by her second and third marriages. Lord Jersey then married American actress Virginia Cherrill on 30 July 1937, the ex-wife of Cary Grant; they were divorced in 1946, without having had children. His third and last wife was Bianca Luciana Adriana Mottironi (d. 2005), whom he married on 16 October 1947. They had three children: George Henry, Isabella and Charles. The elder son's elder son succeeded the 9th Earl in 1998. #George Henry Child Villiers, Viscount Villiers (born 29 August 1948, died 19 March 1998 of a heart attack). Married on 22 December 1969 Verna P. Stott; divorced 1973, with children. Married on 9 January 1974 Sacha Jane Hooper Valpy; divorced 1988, with children. Married in 1992 Stephanie Louisa Penman, with children. # Lady Isabel Bianca Rosa Child- Villiers (b. 11 October 1950), who married Peter Edward Harrison on 12 October 1974 with children, one son (Matthew Alexander Charles Harrison, b. 16 April 1980) and one daughter (Alexandra Venetia Harrison, b. 29 April 1977). # Hon.

When he tried to give Middleton to the National Trust, they refused on the grounds that the house had been remodelled by Lutyens ‚Äì whose houses they now seek particularly. The 9th Earl gave Osterley Park in Hounslow to the nation in the late 1940s; he said of that house, \\"it took a trained staff of 12 to bring me a boiled egg in the morning, and the egg was always cold by the time it got to me!\\" He moved to Radier Manor in Jersey shortly after, where he lived with Bianca until his death. Bianca died in March 2005. Claim to the throne of England Under one legitimist theory, Villiers was the rightful king of England, as the ultimate heir to Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven. Due to disputes over legal standing (some of these theorists contend that because the person on the throne since 1603 has not been the rightful monarch, no laws have changed since then, including divorce laws), both his grandson (the 10th Earl) and his eldest daughter (Lady Caroline) are considered his legal heir by different parties.

He had been one of the greeters of Thomas Coke who had arrived as Wesley's emissary to the new American Church. In 1789 he set up the Methodist Book Concern with $600 of his own money and began to publish books and other literature. Methodist circuit riders from then on carried his materials on their travels and distributed them widely. His first book was Christian Pattern by Thomas √† Kempis. He also published the Methodist hymn book, the Arminian Magazine and later The Methodist Magazine. In time his publishing concern grew into The Methodist Publishing House, which in the mid-twentieth century was the largest religious publishing house in the world. As the principal provider of literature for the growing Methodist movement, he must take a significant amount of credit for its growth into the largest American church by the mid 20th century.

She was the head of the French Communist Party (PCF) from 2001 to 2010. She joined the Party in 1969, and she served in the government as Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports from 4 June 1997 to 5 May 2002. Buffet was re-elected on 16 June 2002 to another five-year term in the National Assembly as a representative of Seine- Saint-Denis. Life and career Buffet was born in Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine. Her father Paul Kosellek is of Polish descent. Buffet was elected in 2001 as National Secretary of the Party, succeeding Robert Hue, who assumed the newly created presidency of the party. When Hue resigned after his poor score in the 2002 presidential elections, the post of president was removed, leaving Buffet as sole leader of the Party. As head of the French Communist Party, Buffet speaks regularly on a variety of topics relating to the plight of the working people. Most of Buffet's speeches tend to focus upon practical implementations of the taxpayer's duty to provide for workers. In one recent speech, Buffet exclaimed that what the working class needed was for the taxpayers to pay higher prices for manufactured goods or to send industry abroad so that workers might get free housing from the government. Other issues that Buffet is interested in and has spoken on are the Bolkestein Directive (a free trade directive issued by the European Union), energy initiatives, and ideological issues linked with stopping privatization and aiding the lower classes or working people. As a member of the French National Parliament, Buffet has begun to recognize the need to organize with the Communist and Socialist parties of other states within the EU. This can be seen in the Marie-George Buffet Statement, which came out in June 2005. It constitutes a comment on the aftermath of the referendum on the establishment of further free trade rulings inside the European Union, one which was rejected by the entirety of the Left. Buffet sees this French Communist victory as a victory for communists across Europe. She remarked: :I invite from the bottom of my heart men and women and organizations of the left, even those who might have voted \\"yes\\", to take your place, to participate with us in this noble adventure to construct another Europe, a genuine left wing alternative. In 2009, she condemned as \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"criminal\\" statements by Pope Benedict XVI which claimed that condoms promote AIDS, although they in fact help prevent it. On 28 February 2013, The Commission des affaires culturelles et de l‚Äô√©ducation, of which Buffet is part, voted in favour of an amendment proposed by Martine Faure, and favoured by Yves Durand, Martine Martinel and Buffet among others, that replaced the biological concepts of \\"sex\\", with the sociological concepts of \\"gender\\" in the national elementary curriculum.assemblee-nationale.fr: \\"Commission des affaires culturelles et de l‚Äô√©ducation Jeudi 28 f√©vrier 2013 S√©ance de 14 heures 30 Compte rendu n¬∞ 31 Pr√©sidence de M.

As Buffet was voted as candidate by most members of the rally, several other participants fell out, denouncing the Communist Party's influence, effectively crippling the \\"anti-liberal left\\" and leaving Buffet as candidate for the sole PCF. Buffet had to compete with the radical-left candidacies of Olivier Besancenot, Jos√© Bov√© and Arlette Laguiller.

Roman Republican and Iberian auxiliary forces under the command of Scipio Africanus routed the Carthaginian army of Hasdrubal Barca. Prelude According to Polybius,VIII.34-37 followed by Livy XXVII.18 after Scipio‚Äôs surprise attack and capture of Carthago Nova, the three Carthaginian armies in Iberia remained separated, and their generals at odds with each other, thus giving the Romans a chance to deal with them one by one. Early in 208 BC, Scipio, with 30,000 Roman and Italian troops and 10,000 Spanish auxiliaries, moved against Hasdrubal Barca, whose 30,000-strong force had wintered at Baecula, on the upper reaches of the river Baetis (modern day Guadalquivir). On learning of the Roman approach, Hasdrubal shifted his camp to a strong defensive position ‚Äî a high and steep plateau south of Baecula, protected by ravines on the flanks and the river to the front and rear. Moreover, the plateau was formed into two steps, on which Hasdrubal posted his light troops on the lower one and his main camp behind. After his arrival, Scipio was at first uncertain as to how to attack such a formidable position, but concerned that the other two Carthaginian armies might take advantage of his inaction and join with Hasdrubal, he took action on the third day.Polybius VIII.39 Livy XXVII.18 Battle Before his main attack, Scipio sent one detachment to block the entrance to the valley separating the two armies and one to the road leading north to Baecula, thus providing security to his main force, while harassing any Carthaginian attempt to retreat. After these preliminary deployments were done, the Roman light troops advanced against their Carthaginian counterparts on the first step. Despite the steep slope, and under a shower of missile attack, the Romans had little difficulty driving back the Carthaginian light troops once they got into hand-to-hand combat. After reinforcing his leading force, Scipio derived a pincer attack on the flanks of the Carthaginian main camp by ordering Gaius Laelius to lead half of the remaining heavy foot to the right of the enemy position, and he himself scaling the left. Hasdrubal, meanwhile, was under the impression that the Roman attack was only a skirmish (Scipio had hidden his main army in camp until the final attack) and failed to properly deploy his main force, thus his ill-prepared army was caught on three sides by the Romans. Despite being trapped, Hasdrubal was able to retreat unmolested with his elephants, main baggage train, and some of his Carthaginian troops. It appeared that his main losses in the battle were the majority of his light troops and Iberian allies. This was largely due to the legionnaires' choice to plunder the Carthaginian camp rather than pursue Hasdrubal with any earnestness. Aftermath After the battle, Hasdrubal led his depleted (and mainly Gallic) army over the western passes of the Pyrenees into Gaul, and subsequently into Italy in an attempt to join his brother Hannibal. Scipio's failure to stop Hasdrubal's march to Italy was criticized by the Roman Senate. Scipio did not exploit his victory at Baecula to drive out the Carthaginians from Iberia, instead choosing to withdraw to his base at Tarraco. He secured alliances with many of the Iberian tribes, who switched sides after the Roman successes at Carthago Nova and Baecula. Carthaginian reinforcements landed in Iberia in 207 BC, and would soon launch a final attempt to recover their losses at the Battle of Ilipa in 206 BC.

It requires less than $10 USD in materials to make, and is made of concrete poured into two simple fibreglass molds, some metal parts, one wrench, and any piece of rock or wood that can serve as a hammer. It accepts a wide range of nut sizes without adjustment. Operators can make necessary adjustments quickly and easily. It is estimated that one Universal Nut Sheller will serve the needs of a village of 2,000 people. The life expectancy of the machine is around 25 years. The Full Belly Project is working to establish local, sustainable businesses that manufacture and distribute appropriate technologies such as the Universal Nut Sheller.  History  In 2001 Jock Brandis traveled to Mali to fix a small village's water treatment system. While there he met a woman who informed him that it would be of great service to her village if he could find an affordable peanut sheller for them. Upon returning to the United States he contacted peanut authority Dr. Tim Williams of UGA, who told Brandis of a Bulgarian peanut shelling design. Jock adapted the design with help from a friend, Wes Perry. Jock went through several iterations of a redesign and one year later he completed the machine which is now called the Universal Nut Sheller. In 2003 Brandis teamed up with a group of returned Peace Corps volunteers from Wilmington, North Carolina, to form the Full Belly Project, dedicated to designing and distributing unique appropriate technologies in developing countries.  Operation  Diagram of the shelling machine The user loads the desired crop in the space at the top. The user turns the handle, which rotates the rotor continuously. This movement facilitates the nuts falling down the gradually narrowing gap. The shell of each nut is broken at the point where the gap is sufficiently narrow and the rotor motion causes sufficient friction to crack open the shell. The adjustable minimum width of the gap allows a range of nut sizes to be shelled. The kernels and shell fragments fall into a basket and are later separated by winnowing. The device works best for Jatropha curcas, shea, dried coffee, and peanuts (ground nuts). The Full Belly Project has developed a pedal powered agricultural processor, which places the universal nut sheller onto a pedaling chassis. In addition to the shelling method described, the pedaling apparatus is connected to a fan. The fan automatically winnows the harvest (separates the shells from the nuts). The pedal powered versions are capable of shelling the same variety of crops as the hand crank powered versions. The processor also provides access for the winnowing section to be used independently from the sheller. This allows winnowing of crops that are not shelled, including rice, maize, and sorghum.  Problems  The universal nut sheller has been less than successful in Ghana. First hand accounts relate almost universal breakage. Users can mitigate this breakage by pouring the nuts through initially at very broad settings and only later at finer settings, this practice does not eliminate the breakage and destroys the efficiency aspect. Groundnut shelling tends to be a social activity everyone engages in during their down time and there is rarely a need for a peanut sheller. The Universal Nut Sheller proved incapable of shelling shea nuts in a manner useful for shea butter extraction for the shea nuts of Ghana. However, there are reports that it works for shea nuts from trees in Uganda. The cost also proved a significant barrier. It simply cost far more to produce (even excepting the cost of the mold, transport of materials to the village, travel to the nearest town to find someone capable of welding the metal parts, etc.) than individual growers were able to pay. However, growers unions who made the investment have been successful.  Awards  * 1st place - Popular Mechanics 2006 Breakthrough Awards.

It is situated south of Little Weighton and approximately south-west of Beverley town centre. St Peter's Church, Rowley The civil parish is formed by the villages of Rowley and Little Weighton together with the hamlets of Bentley, High Hunsley, Risby and part of the hamlet of Riplingham. According to the 2011 UK census, Rowley parish had a population of 1,015, a decrease on the 2001 UK census figure of 1,030. The village of Rowley is now mostly depopulated, leaving only a few houses, and most of the population is now in Little Weighton. History Rev. Ezekiel Rogers, who became Rector of Rowley in 1621, was suspended from the parish church in 1638 for his non-conformist beliefs. Following this, he led 20 families to emigrate to the American colonies, where he founded the town of Rowley, Massachusetts in 1639. The emigrants sailed from Hull in , probably a merchant ship of around 200 tons, probably in June 1638, arriving in Salem, Massachusetts in August. One of those 20 families was the Grants, who are direct forebears of the model Jodie Kidd, as revealed in a 2008 edition of the BBC genealogy programme Who Do You Think You Are?. Also among the 1638 emigrants were two brothers, Richard and Thomas Wickham. Samuel, a son of Thomas, settled in Rhode Island and became a Freeman of the Colony and a Deputy. Another descendant, Captain John Clements Wickham served on the Royal Navy ship during its voyage with Charles Darwin and was later the first Magistrate and administrator of Queensland. Rev. Levett Edward Thoroton, son of Col. Thomas Blackborne Thoroton Hildyard of Flintham Hall, Flintham, Nottinghamshire, was rector of Rowley for 23 years. He is commemorated by a tablet on the south aisle of St Peter's Church in Rowley. The Hildyard family had a long association with Rowley and its church, where they were patrons of the living. The local church contains many memorials to the family. The church was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1968 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England.

Agnellus became known for his humble piety and prudence. In 1233 King Henry III asked him to help arbitrate a dispute with Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke that had broken out into civil war. The following year, he was part of a delegation representing the English bishops at the Roman Curia. Throughout his life, Agnellus would never allow expansion to the friars quarters, beyond what was absolutely necessary. This practice was maintained for a little more than a decade, until Haymo of Faversham began the expansion of the English order's holdings so that they would be able to provide for themselves rather than depend on others' charity. By the time of his death, there were forty-three friaries established in the English Province. Agnellus died after a brief illness, on 7 May 1236. His remains were buried at Oxford.

Deepalakshmis are many but none resembles the other. The Otraikkal Mandapam (single stone hall) made of a single stone 3 feet thick, is a marvel. Oorthuva Thandavam, Venugopala, Rathi, Manmatha, Lakshmana and Indrajit are excellently carved. The temple is also renowned for its murals. The composite columns of Virabhadra holding sword and horn are found be additions of the Vijayanayagara kings during the early 1500s. Similar columns of Virabhadra are found in Meenakshi Temple at Madurai, Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli, Kasi Viswanathar temple at Tenkasi, Krishnapuram Venkatachalapathy temple, Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram, Soundararajaperumal temple at Thadikombu, Srivilliputhur Andal temple, Srivaikuntanathan Permual temple at Srivaikuntam, Avudayarkovil, Vaishnava Nambi and Thirukurungudivalli Nachiar temple at Thirukkurungudi. Going by extant legends, the temple is closely associated with the famous Sree AnanthaPadmanabhaswamy Temple, Thiruvananthapuram. Thiruvananthapuram Sri Anantha Padmanabhaswamy temple deity lies in the direction as to see the Thiruvattar Adi kesava deity. The main deity was originally covered with gold kavachams in which diamonds and other precious stones were embedded which the Kerala kings had presented to the temple. There is also a small shrine for Lord Lakshmi Narasimhaswamy near the river and opposite to the Adikesavaperumal Temple. Alvar saint Nammalvar had sung 11 pasurams in praise of AdiKesavaSwamy. Treasures Pillared halls around the second precinct The entire present day Kanyakumari District formed part of erstwhile Thiruvithamkoor or Travancore Kingdom. Up to Marthanda Varma, all kings ruled the erstwhile Venad Kingdom (which was expanded by Marthanda Varma to form Thiruvithaamkoor) from Padmanabhapuram in Kanyakumari District. It was Dharma Raja, the nephew and successor of Marthanda Varma, who shifted the capital to Thiruvananthapuram. Padmanabhapuram Palace, the erstwhile royal abode of Travancore Kings, is still preserved in all its glory and is situated at Padmanabhapuram in Kalkulam Taluk of Kanyakumari District. Marthanda Varma was a staunch devotee of Lord Adikesava and used to worship at the temple before all the major war campaigns undertaken by him. Legend The Lord AdiKesavaSwamy means 'Foremost Friend'. Legend says that Lord AdiKesavaSwamy defeated the demon Kesi. The demon's wife prayed to the River Ganges and to River Thamirabarani and created a destruction. But it was in vain and she surrendered to the Lord. Thus, the formation of the rivers made in a circle came to be known as Thiruvattaru. Festivals and prasadhams Vaikunta Ekadesi is celebrated with pomp and glory. Paal Payasam (Milk Kheer), Aval and Appam are delicious prasadams at this temple. The pujas are done in the same manner as that of the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple, Thiruvananthapuram.

Mission in society and general strategy According to Catholic officials and scholars, Opus Dei is God's Work performing a divine operation in society which mobilises Christians to sanctify secular realities from within. Opus Dei does not act as a group, they say. It is a spiritual, catechetical agency of the Catholic Church in charge of forming people so they can act with personal responsibility \\"to put Christ on top of all human activities,\\" as their founder says. Arnold Hall Conference Center in Massachusetts Escriva said that Opus Dei evangelises people of all social classes: \\"Out of a hundred souls, we are interested in one hundred.\\" Opus Dei‚Äôs Statutes says that the goal of Opus Dei is to bring about that persons of all walks of life, first of all the intellectuals, practice Christianity through the sanctification of their work \\"so that all things will be put in order according to the Will of the Creator.\\"2.1 and 2.2; See Fuenmayor 1994, p. 610-611 According to Vittorio Messori in his book Opus Dei: Leadership and Vision in Today‚Äôs Catholic Church, Opus Dei‚Äôs manner of influencing society is based on the principle that \\"there is no way of improving humanity other than improving human beings--one by one, and profoundly.\\" Thus it has what it calls apostolate of friendship. Also, it follows the strategy of emphasising the evangelisation of the intelligentsia because, he says, \\"society arrives at the majority of its ideas and modes of behavior by way of the intellectuals.\\"p. 111; 177 So that the sanctification of society can take place through sanctification of work, the Opus Dei provides \\"professional formation.\\" This stresses hard work, cultural and professional development, human warmth and refinement, ethical behaviour, respect for freedom and pluralism, personal and collective humility, and personal prayer as the highest priority in one's daily schedule. The main strategy, according to Escriv√°'s teaching, is that each Christian must strive to become a \\"canonizable saint\\", another Christ redeeming all men and women, and thus also a responsible citizen who works for the common good. Because if Christians are not well ordered from within, he says, if they do not put God first through a life of contemplation, they will be merely spreading their disorder to other people. \\"These world crises\\", he says, \\"are crises of saints.\\" Thus, evangelization in Opus Dei is done one-on- one through its \\"apostolate of friendship and confidence.\\" Peter L. Berger and Samuel Huntington calls the attempt of Opus Dei an \\"alternative modernity,\\" a work towards a modern world which is \\"faithful\\" to the Christian traditions, as distinguished from other secular interventions in modernity. (Many Globalizations: Cultural Diversity in the Contemporary World 2002) Activities and work The largest part of the apostolic activity of the prelature is what the individual members do with their friends and colleagues in their respective communities and workplaces. Collective formative activities consist of religious retreats, recollections, and classes in Catholic doctrine. A big percentage of the undertakings of members of Opus Dei, if not the majority, are youth development centres: schools, youth clubs, study centres. There are also a good number of training centres for women. In Spain, Saint Josemar√≠a Escriv√° himself founded the University of Navarra in 1959 which confers 27 degrees and administers more than 300 post-graduate programs and includes a teaching hospital. =Opus Dei academic institutions= Schools *PAREF Southridge School, Muntinlupa, Philippines *PAREF Woodrose School, Muntinlupa, Philippines *PAREF Springdale School, Cebu City, Philippines *PAREF Westbridge School, Iloilo City, Philippines *PAREF Rosehill School, Antipolo, Philippines *PAREF Northfield School, Quezon City, Philippines *PAREF Southcrest School, Cebu City, Philippines *Rosevale School, Cagayan de Oro, Philippines Universities Universities operated by or related to Opus Dei are *Centro de Extens√£o Universit√°ria, S√£o Paulo, Brazil *IAE Business School, Buenos Aires, Argentina *IESE Business School, Barcelona, Spain *Instituto Panamericano de Alta Direcci√≥n de Empresa (IPADE), Mexico D.F., Mexico *ISE - Instituto Superior de Empresa, S√£o Paulo, Brazil *Lexington College, Chicago, USA *PAD: Escuela de Alta Direcci√≥n de la Universidad de Piura, Lima, Peru *Pan-Atlantic University, Lagos, Nigeria *Pontifical University of the Holy Cross, Rome, Italy *Strathmore University, Nairobi, Kenya *Universidad Austral, Buenos Aires, Argentina *Universidad Bonaterra, Aguascalientes, Mexico *Universidad de La Sabana, Ch√≠a, Colombia *Universidad de Los Hemisferios, Quito, Ecuador *Universidad de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay *Universidad del Istmo, Fraijanes, Guatemala *Universidad Monte√°vila, Caracas, Venezuela *Universidad Panamericana, Mexico D.F., Mexico *Universit√† Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy *Universitat Internacional de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain *University of Asia and the Pacific, Pasig City, Philippines *University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain *University of Piura, Piura, Peru *University of the Andes, Santiago, Chile Membership profile The Vatican Yearbook indicates that Opus Dei has 85,000 members about 1,900 of whom are priests. Of these 1,900 priests, 25 are bishops working in various dioceses. Members are distributed as follows: Africa 1600; Asia and the Pacific 4700; Americas, North and South 29,000; Europe 48,700. In terms of educational level, income and social status, V. Messori says that there is a predominance of middle-to-low levels among the members of Opus Dei. In Spain and Latin America, for example, Opus Dei is predominantly popular among laborers and campesinos.1997, p. 84 Gomez Perez, in Opus Dei: Una Explicaci√≥n, says that Opus Dei's social composition shows a correspondence with the local situation, because, he says, all honest trades can be sanctified. He also says that there are more teachers and professors among its ranks than the normal social composition because of Opus Dei's emphasis on the intellectual apostolate. Critics, however, accuse Opus Dei of elitism, and say that Opus Dei has amassed both power and wealth. On the other hand, John Allen in Opus Dei: Secrets and Power in the Catholic Church, says that Opus Dei's assets in the World are estimated to be at $2,800 million minimum, compared with an annual revenue for the Catholic Church in the US of $102 billion. By comparison, General Motors has assets of $455 billion. The worldwide revenue of Opus Dei is that of a mid-sized American diocese. He also says that Opus Dei has only 39 bishops out of the 4,564 in the world. And there are only 20 members out of 3920 working in the Vatican. As to real estate holdings, Opus Dei's holdings are notably inferior to those of the religious orders, says V. Messori. \\"Monks live in communities that require houses, while the great majority of Opus Dei members continue to live their everyday lives in their own homes.\\" Revolutionary or conservative? Opus Dei's influence in society, said Escriv√°, is not socio-economic but ethical: rich and poor work together to build a society that is more human, just, and progressive. However, in \\"Preserving Power and Privilege,\\" a report of Catholics for a Free Choice, Opus Dei is categorised together with Neocatechumenal Way, Focolare, Legion of Christ, Community of St. John, Charismatic Renewal, and Communion and Liberation, among Catholic groups having \\"neoconservative or fundamentalist moral and political beliefs,\\" \\"extremely traditionalist,\\" and \\"pre-enlightenment\\" messages for society. In contrast, Benedict XVI praises the catechetical work of these lay organizations and commented on the profile of Opus Dei as \\"this surprising link between absolute fidelity to the great tradition of the Church and to her faith, with a disarming simplicity and unconditional openness to all the challenges of this world, in the academic world, in the world of work, in the world of economics, etc.\\" There are also modern historians, many of whom are non-Catholics, who are now stating that the Catholic Church supports reason and progress, putting it \\"at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization,\\" in the words of Paul Legutko of Stanford University in his review of Thomas Woods' book How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization, Woods refers to both non-Catholic and Catholic historians of science: J.L. Heilbron, Alistair Cameron Crombie, David C. Lindberg, Edward Grant, and Thomas Goldstein, Stanley Jaki; economists: Joseph Schumpeter and Raymund de Roover; art historians: Kenneth Clark, Samuel Edgerton; historian of hospitals: Guenter B. Risse. Wood's book supports Christopher Dawson's thesis about religion \\"as the dynamic element in history and as a real world- transforming power.\\" Rodney Stark's The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success, Random House 2005. The debate about Opus Dei and its role in society continues. The two diametrically opposed positions are reflected in how one interprets point 353 of Escriv√°'s The Way: Opus Dei's prelatic church, Our Lady of Peace, located in the central headquarters in Rome. Below the altar lie the mortal remains of St. Josemar√≠a. Critics say this type of counsel makes it impossible for Opus Dei members to be free in political matters, since it creates ideologies such as \\"National Catholicism\\", according to Alberto Moncada, or \\"Catholic Totalitarianism,\\" according to Argentine Marxist historian Emilio Corbiere. Thus, Opus Dei members are placed squarely on the political right, becoming a conservative influence in world affairs, promoting the Vatican's traditionalist policies against divorce, abortion, euthanasia, gay marriages, contraception, etc. ‚ÄúThe claim that Opus Dei is merely a humanitarian organization with no political agenda is simply not credible,‚Äù said Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice. Opus Dei, according to its critics, serves as the Vatican's instrument to oppose the liberal and secular thought expressed by John Stuart Mill's classic statement: \\"The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way,\\" and lately put into American jurisprudence in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey 1992, ‚ÄúAt the heart of liberty is the right to define one‚Äôs own concept of existence, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\\" On the other hand, while espousing respect for each person's freedom of religion and search for truth, Ratzinger says that when there is rebellion against the light of truth revealed by Christ on man's origin and purpose, man is imprisoned in a meaningless existence.Ratzinger, Joseph. Behold the Pierced One. Ignatius Press 1986. The \\"attempt to be our own god, creator and judge,\\" he stated in The Way of the Cross, leads to self- destruction. The \\"choice of error does not liberate,\\" says Escriv√°, and brings instead the \\"slavery of sin.\\" His supporters say that the Catholic Church per se is beyond earthly power struggles and is engaged in a fundamental struggle for the peace and happiness of each soul: the battle between the powers of evil and the God-man Jesus Christ who, in the words of Opus Dei's founder, \\"never loses battles.\\" According to Escriv√°, \\"face-to-face with God, there is no room for anonymity: either one decides to be his friend or his foe.\\" He also states in a key teaching: \\"Many great things depend ‚Äî don't forget it ‚Äî on whether you and I live our lives as God wants.\\" His supporters say that if Christians throughout the world are completely faithful to the Beauty of Truth, Jesus Christ, then \\"the greatest revolution of all time would take place,\\" according to what they see as the prophetic vision of Opus Dei's founder, a vision altogether dismissed by its many critics.

He made his first amateur appearance in local stage productions at the age of fifteen. Though aspiring to be an actor, he worked at many different jobs during the 1930s, including selling beauty supplies and lingerie. After moving to Cleveland, Ohio, White began a career in vaudeville and burlesque, traveling widely before landing a role on Broadway. In 1942, White made his Broadway debut in The Moon is Down, followed by a successful performance in the role of a sanitarium orderly in the popular play Harvey. He would later reprise his role in the 1950 film version and the 1972 television movie. In 1947, White made his film debut in a small part in Kiss of Death. During the 1950s, he began landing roles on television shows, including appearances in Danny Thomas's Make Room for Daddy and Peter Lawford's Dear Phoebe. In 1954, he landed a semi-regular role as Cagey Calhoun on Private Secretary, starring Ann Sothern, Ann Tyrrell, and Don Porter. The role led to another semi-regular part as the deceitful Oscar Pudney on CBS's The Ann Sothern Show in 1960. White guest-starred on Four Star Playhouse and NBC's The Bob Cummings Show. He also appeared in roles in The Bad Seed (1956); Designing Woman (1957), with Lauren Bacall; and Marjorie Morningstar (1958), with Natalie Wood and Gene Kelly. On October 2, 1958, White portrayed the fast-talking, presumably dishonest, used-car salesman San Fernando Harry in the segment \\"The New Car\\" of the ABC sitcom, The Real McCoys, starring Walter Brennan, with whom he clashes in this episode, Richard Crenna, and Kathleen Nolan. From 1958 to 1965, White made five guest appearances on Perry Mason. In his first appearance he played murderer Luke Hickey in \\"The Case of the Married Moonlighter.\\" His third appearance featured him as murder victim Burt Renshaw in \\"The Case of the Polka Dot Pony.\\" In his final appearance he played murder victim Max Armstead in \\"The Case of the Fatal Fortune.\\" In the 1960s, White appeared on Tightrope, Oh! Those Bells, The Twilight Zone, The Dick Van Dyke Show; The Donna Reed Show; The Andy Griffith Show; The Roaring 20s, Mickey, starring Mickey Rooney; The Beverly Hillbillies; Petticoat Junction;The Munsters; The Addams Family; That Girl; and I Dream of Jeannie. In a memorable cameo, he played a frustrated airport tower controller (alongside Paul Ford, Carl Reiner & Eddie Ryder) in Stanley Kramer's It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). In 1966, he accepted the role of Donelli in The Reluctant Astronaut, playing a curmudgeonly janitorial supervisor who instructed his students in the use of a mop in a deadpan delivery rivaling that of an aerospace engineer. In a short but memorable performance, he routinely castigated Don Knotts's bumbling character Roy Fleming for his \\"lack of dedication\\" to cleaning floors. An advertising director who saw his performance on the film's release soon cast him in a television advertising campaign for the Maytag Corporation. Prior to his \\"career\\" as a washing machine repairman, White was briefly employed as a general repairman in the Twilight Zone episode: \\"Once Upon A Time\\" (episode 78, airing in 1961) appearing with Buster Keaton. White played the role of a lonely Maytag repairman, a man with nothing to do as a result of his company's dependable products. In one of the campaign's first spots, White's character unmistakably alluded to his former role as 'Donelli': \\"At ease men! Now, you men have all volunteered to be Maytag Repairmen and so I'm gonna give it to you straight. Maytag washers and dryers are built to last. That makes the Maytag Repairman the loneliest guy in town!\\"Advertising Mascots: People; The Maytag Man TVAcres.com (2009) The campaign proved wildly successful, and the actor began a long-running and highly paid career as the ever-lonely Maytag repairman. White continued appearing in both television and films during his many years as the Maytag repairman. His final film role was a small but pivotal role in the 1993 Joe Dante comedy Matinee starring John Goodman, and his last TV role was in an episode of Seinfeld in 1996, \\"The Cadillac\\". Seinfeld co-creator/star Jerry Seinfeld, who also co-wrote the episode, had been a fan of White since his appearances on The Ann Sothern Show, and described having him on Seinfeld as a boyhood dream come true. White was also a member of the stellar band of voiceover actors who voiced Stan Freberg's classic lampoon of American history, Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America: Volume One The Early Years, and thirty-five years later, \\"The Middle Years.\\" In addition to film and television work, White lent his voice to such cartoons as Jonny Quest, Garfield and Friends, and Inspector Gadget. Personal life In 1942, White married Celia Cohn (July 17, 1914 ‚Äì August 5, 2003). The couple had two daughters, Carole Ita White (who later became an actress) and Janet Jonas. Death On January 9, 1997, White died from a heart attack following surgery, six days after his 80th birthday. He is interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park in Los Angeles.

The fourth of Ray's feature films, it was filmed at Nimtita Raajbari, in Nimtita village, 10 kilometres from Murshidabad. Despite initial poor critical reception in India, Jalsaghar went on to win the Presidential Award for best film in New Delhi, and played a significant role in establishing Ray's international reputation as a director. It has since gained near-universal critical acclaim, and has come to be regarded by the cinema community as one of the greatest films of all time. Plot Jalsaghar depicts the end days of a decadent zamindar (landlord) in Bengal and his efforts to uphold his family prestige while facing economic adversity. The landlord, Biswambhar Roy (Chhabi Biswas), is a just but otherworldly man who loves to spend time listening to music and putting up spectacles rather than managing his properties ravaged by floods and the government's abolition of the zamindari system. He is challenged by a commoner who has attained riches through business dealings, in putting up spectacles and organising music fests. This is the tale of a zamindar who has nothing left but respect and sacrifices his family and wealth trying to retain it.

After the box office failure of Aparajito, Ray desperately needed a hit film and decided to make a film based on both a popular piece of literature and a film that would incorporate Indian music. It was the first film to extensively incorporate classical Indian music and dancing. Ray began shooting in May 1957. While in pre-production, Ray and his crew had difficulty finding a suitable location for Biswambhar Roy's palace. By chance they met a man who recommended the palace of Roy Chowdhurys in Nimtita, known as the Nimtita Rajbari and Ray decided to scout the location. To his surprise the palace was not only perfect for the film but just so happened to have once belonged to Upendra Narayan, whom Bandopadhyay had based his main character on when first writing the short story. Ray worked closely with composer Ustad Vilayat Khan on the film, although he was initially uncertain about the composer's musical choices and had to convince Khan to make more sombre music pieces for the film. According to Ray, \\"The Nimtita palace was perfect, except that the music room‚Äìit did have one, for Ganendra Narayan's uncle Upendra Narayan Choudhury had been a patron of music much like the nobleman in our story‚Äìwas not impressive enough to serve as the setting for the sumptuous soir√©es that I had planned.\\"Ray, Satyajit. \\"Winding Route to a Music Room,\\" in Our Films, Their Films. New York: Hyperion, 1994, p. 46 Therefore, the film's famed jalsaghar scenes were made inside the Aurora Film Corporation studio In Maniktala, Kolkata. The studio has now been demolished. Reception Although the film received mostly poor reviews in India, it received the Presidential Award in New Delhi for best film.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. 842‚Äì843. When the film was gradually released in Europe and the US in the early 1960s it became a critical and financial hit and helped establish Ray's international reputation, although Ray said that in 1958 he did not think that the film would be successful in foreign markets. New Statesman film critic John Coleman compared Ray to Jean RenoirWakeman. pp. 842‚Äì843. and Marie Seton said that the film \\"challenged the whole convention of songs and dances in India cinema. Audiences...conditioned to the introduction of songs and dances as entertainment interludes and [as] dramatic and romantic stresses, had never before been confronted with...classical singing and dancing as integral focal points of realistic sequences.\\"Wakeman. pp. 843. John Russell Taylor said that the film was \\"one of Ray's most masterly films, exquisitely photographed and directed with a complete, unquestioning mastery of mood ... For those willing to place themselves under its hypnotic spell it offers pleasures of unique delicacy.\\" Roger Ebert hailed it as \\"[Ray's] most evocative film, and he fills it with observant details.\\" In 1963 Bosley Crowther praised the \\"delicacy of direction ... [and] eloquence of Indian music and the aurora of mise en sc√®ne.\\" However, that same year Stanley Kauffmann criticised the film, calling it \\"a deeply felt, extremely tedious film...the Indian music is simply uncongenial and tiresome to our ears.\\" In 1965 Derek Malcolm called it Ray's \\"most perfect film.\\" When the film was released in Paris in 1981 it was a surprise hit and led many French critics to adopt a new appreciation for Ray that had not been common in France up to that time. San Francisco Chronicle critic Edward Guthmann described it as \\"A wonderful tale of pride and the fools it makes of men.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 100% based on 20 reviews with an average rating of 9.09/10. Box office In 1981, the film was a box office success in France, where it sold 173,758 tickets, the highest for an Indian film up until Salaam Bombay! (1988).

A proposed merger with Nisa-Today's collapsed in November 2006, after concerns about a cartel. which were reported to the Office of Fair Trading by members of Nisa-Today's, who opposed the merger. These claims were eventually proved to be unfounded and no action was taken by the OFT.

Three shops did not merge with SandpiperCI, due to their proximity to other shops of SandpiperCI. Since the merger, the store in St Ouen initially closed, but then re opened as the third Alliance with Tesco store on the island, and the remaining two shops in St John and Green Island are now trading as yourstore, initially a chain of two stores, but now a chain of five stores.

Early life Berlandier was born in Geneva, and later trained as a botanist there. During this time he probably served an apprenticeship to a pharmacist.Bour, Roger. (2016) Where and when was Jean Louis Berlandier born? Notes on Jean Louis Berlandier. I. Bibliotheca Herpetologica. volume 12. number 1 & 2\\\\. pages 18-40. Career In his early 20s on the recommendation of his mentor, Auguste Pyrame De Candolle, he joined a Mexican scientific expedition as a biologist and plant specialist. Berlandier arrived at P√°nuco, in the Mexican state of Veracruz, in December 1826. He collected plants in the surrounding area before continuing into Texas as part of the Mexican Boundary Commission. The commission left Mexico City on November 10, 1827, under the command of Manuel de Mier y Ter√°n. Berlandier made botanical collections around Laredo, Texas, in February 1828 and around San Antonio, Gonzales, and San Felipe in March, April, and May 1828. After a brief trip to the interior of the country after he contacted malaria, he returned to San Antonio. He collected botanical specimens, made notes on animal species, and collected information on over forty Native American tribes in the surrounding territory, with special emphasis on the Comanche. In the fall of 1828, with a group of 30 Mexican soldiers led by Colonel Jos√© Francisco Ruiz, Berlandier accompanied Comanche leaders Reyuna and El Ronca on a bear and American Bison hunt on open lands northwest of San Antonio. From November 19 to December 18, Berlandier accompanied Ruiz to explore the silver mines on the San Saba River. On February 3, 1829, he also joined a force led by Antonio Elos√∫a to put down an uprising against the presidio commander at Goliad.Hartmann, CP. \\"Berlandier, Jean Louis\\" The Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Assn. Downloaded 09/07/2015. After the commission was dissolved in November 1829, Berlandier settled in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, and became a physician. He made additional botanical and animal collecting trips in Texas and other parts of Mexico, including returning to Goliad in 1834. Berlandier compiled detailed information on the expeditions, including catalogues of plants, animals and Native American groups. This information is among the earliest ethnological studies of the tribes of the southern plains. One of his original manuscripts, dated 1834, is currently held by the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Berlandier served as a captain, cartographer, and aide-de-camp in Mexico's Army of the North at the outbreak of hostilities between the United States and Mexico in the spring of 1846, under the command of General (later President) Mariano Arista. Captain Berlandier drew the first sketch maps of the battle of Palo Alto (May 8, 1846), which now reside in the Library of Congress. Berlandier's extensive knowledge of the region of south Texas and Tamaulipas, garnered from his field explorations to collect botanical specimens, was invaluable to General Arista. After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the fighting in February 1848, Berlandier was asked in 1850 to take part in the International Boundary Commission to define the border between Mexico and the United States. During the Mexican War he was placed in charge of the hospitals in Matamoros and served as an interpreter. In 1851 Berlandier drowned in the San Fernando River near Matamoros.

The gardens are located in 500 acre Tyrrell Park at 6088 Babe Zaharias Drive, Beaumont, Texas, USA. An extra benefit is that the gardens are located in a migratory bird flyway. Tyrrell Park is listed on the Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail map. Hours and accessibility The outdoor gardens are open to the public every day during daylight hours at no charge; while the conservatory is open Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 9 am to 4 pm, Saturday and Sunday from 1 pm to 5 pm from April through October and noon to 4 pm November through March. (closed on Wednesdays and major holidays) Both the outdoor gardens and the Warren Loose Conservatory are wheel chair and stroller accessible. A large meeting center is also on the grounds. History The gardens trace their origin to April 12, 1951 when the Beaumont Council of Garden Clubs was formed. Creation of a public garden was one of the goals of that organization. The gardens were first established in 1968 when the city of Beaumont set aside 10 acres of land at Tyrrell Park. The Beaumont Garden Center Building was dedicated on August 20, 1971. In 1972, a master plan for the gardens was drawn up, and labeling of the trees, vines, and shrubs begun. The Beaumont Garden Center became the Beaumont Botanical Gardens in 1996.McDonald, Elvin; Kevin Vandivier; Earl Nottingham. \\"Texas Public Gardens\\". Gretna, La.: Pelican Publishing Company, 2008, p. 30, . In 1999, the city of Beaumont set aside additional acreage increasing the gardens to the present size of 23.5 acres.

The Loose Conservatory features tropical plants from around the world, a waterfall, a Koi fish pool; and many theme gardens displaying camellias, modern and antique roses, bromeliads, and native plants. The Warren Loose Conservatory was dedicated on September 7, 1997. The Binks Horticultural Center was dedicated on February 14, 2000. The Bob Whitman Propagation House has a collection of rare bromeliads and orchids. =Recovery from Hurricanes Rita and Ike= Hurricane Rita, in 2005, and Hurricane Ike in 2008, both damaged the conservatory as well as numerous trees on the garden grounds. In addition, the outdoor walks were damaged. Many plants died. Not only was the damage repaired and plants replaced, but many improvements to the grounds and buildings were made.

The service is available on a wide range of devices, including mobile phones and tablets, personal computers, and smart televisions. iPlayer services delivered to UK-based viewers feature no commercial advertising. The terms BBC iPlayer, iPlayer, and BBC Media Player refer to various methods for viewing or listening to the same content. Viewing or recording live television broadcasts from any UK broadcaster, or viewing BBC TV catch-up or BBC TV on demand programmes in the UK without a TV licence is a criminal offence. In 2015, the BBC reported that it was moving towards playing audio and video content via open HTML5 standards in web browsers rather than via Flash or their Media Player mobile app. On 17 October 2018, the BBC 'iPlayer Radio' brand was replaced with BBC Sounds.  History  BBC Redux was developed as a proof of concept for a cross-platform, Flash Video- based streaming system. BBC iPlayer left beta and went live on 25 December 2007. On 25 June 2008, a new-look iPlayer was launched, originally as a beta- test version alongside the earlier version. The site tagline was \\"Catch up on the last 7 days of BBC TV & Radio\\", reflecting that programmes were unavailable on iPlayer after this time (with some exceptions). The BBC state on their website that this is due to copyright reasons. The marketing slogan was later changed to \\"Making the unmissable, unmissable\\". In May 2010 the site was updated again, to include a recommendations feature and a \\"social makeover\\". In February 2011, the BBC iPlayer was once again modified to include links to programmes from other broadcasters, including ITV, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, Channel 4, E4, More4, Film4, Channel 5, 5Star, 5USA and S4C. The feature was added to the search function and the channels function. When users click on a programme by another broadcaster, they are redirected to the relevant broadcaster's catch up service (either the ITV Hub, All 4 or My5). In April 2014, BBC iPlayer was once again relaunched with a new look and a different user interface. From October 2014, the BBC extended the programme availability for programmes on iPlayer from 7 days to 30 days. However, due to legal reasons, most news bulletins are only available for 24 hours after initial broadcast (with the exception of World Business Report, Business Live, Victoria Derbyshire, Daily Politics, Politics Europe, Sunday Politics and Newsnight) . Some archive programming is available for the long term, such as Timewatch. Specific applications for mobile platforms were launched in February 2011. These were initially for iOS and Android devices, where the launch would have the biggest impact.  Development  The original iPlayer service was launched in October 2005, undergoing a five-month trial by five thousand broadband users until 28 February 2006. iPlayer was heavily criticised for delay in its launch, rebranding, and cost to BBC licence-fee payers, because no finished product had been released after four years of development. A new, improved iPlayer service then had another very limited user trial which began on 15 November 2006. At various times during its development, iPlayer was known as the Integrated Media Player (iMP), Interactive Media Player, and MyBBCPlayer. The iPlayer received the approval of the BBC Trust on 30 April 2007, and an open beta for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 was launched at midnight on 27 July 2007, where it was announced that only a fixed number of people would be able to sign up for the service, with a controlled increase in users over the summer. The BBC had been criticised for saying that the iPlayer would 'launch' on 27 July 2007, when what was on offer was simply an extension of the beta to an open beta, admitting more users in a controlled manner. This was done reportedly to allow British ISPs and the BBC to gauge the effect of the iPlayer traffic on the Internet within the UK. The open beta incorporated a media player, an electronic programme guide (EPG) and specially designed download client, and allowed the download of BBC Television content by computers assigned to a United Kingdom-based IP address, for use up to thirty days after broadcast. However, it was available only to users of Windows XP. This was a controversial decision by the BBC, which led to a petition against the decision being posted on 10 Downing Street's e-petition website. The petition reached 16,082 signatures on 20 August 2007. The response from the Government was: > ... the Trust noted the strong public demand for the service to be available > on a variety of operating systems. The BBC Trust made it a condition of > approval for the BBC's on-demand services that the iPlayer is available to > users of a range of operating systems, and has given a commitment that it > will ensure that the BBC meets this demand as soon as possible. They will > measure the BBC's progress on this every six months and publish the > findings. On 16 October 2007, the BBC announced a strategic relationship with Adobe, that would bring a limited, streaming-only version of the iPlayer to Mac and Linux users, and Windows users who cannot or do not wish to use the iPlayer download service, such as Windows 9x users. The streaming service was launched on 13 December 2007. Most programmes can be viewed for up to seven days after broadcast, unlike the thirty days provided by the download service. Since January 2008, iPlayer has supported Mozilla Firefox under the Microsoft Windows platform for downloading content. Before the iPlayer had even launched, it was announced that the BBC, alongside ITV and Channel 4, were intending to launch a new video on demand platform, provisionally named Kangaroo. It was intended that Kangaroo would complement the video on demand services that these channels were already offering, including the iPlayer, by making programmes available once their \\"catch up\\" period expires. The Kangaroo project was eventually abandoned after being blocked by the Competition Commission early in 2009. Following a deal between the BBC and cable television provider Virgin Media, the iPlayer service was made available through the provider's on-demand service. The cable service launched on 30 April 2008, and keeps the look and feel of the BBC iPlayer program. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the BBC revealed that as of 8 April 2008 the iPlayer had so far cost ¬£6 million to develop. On 23 August 2008, a new feature, Series Stacking, was announced. This feature started being rolled out on 13 September 2008, and allowed viewers to watch previous programmes from selected series until the series has ended, with a limit of up to thirteen weeks after first broadcast. Not all programmes will form part of the stack, however. The BBC Trust permitted 15% of content to be offered as part of the stacking service; soaps, news bulletins and review-based programmes will not be stacked, nor programmes containing material of a legal nature, such as Crimewatch. On 19 December 2008, the BBC released, as part of the iPlayer Labs feature, iPlayer Desktop for OS X and Linux operating systems. This moved the download service away from the previous P2P-based distribution model and onto an HTTP download model. On 20 April 2009, the BBC incorporated high-definition streams and downloads of some content on the iPlayer. There are plans to roll out the HD streams to devices such as the Virgin Set Top Box, but no date has yet been set. An iPlayer application for the PlayStation 3 was announced by Sony in August 2009 and was released on 1 September 2009 along with the Firmware 3.0 update to coincide with the launch of the slimline PlayStation 3. Another version of iPlayer was released in late 2009 as a 'channel' for the Nintendo Wii. This shows only low definition videos of BBC shows up to seven days after their release on television. On 28 July 2011, BBC Worldwide released an international version of the iPlayer. Speaking in 2012, Ralph Rivera, BBC Director of Future Media, said that \\"In the same way as the BBC has a role in making sure there is a healthy TV ecosystem, the BBC should be playing the same sort of role in the digital sector. It's part of why we have a licence fee.\\" BBC Radio services delivered via iPlayer were relaunched on 8 October 2012 under the BBC iPlayer Radio brand. The rebranded service offered different functionality to the main iPlayer interface and a BBC iPlayer Radio smartphone app was also launched. On 26 September 2013 BBC iPlayer Desktop was replaced by BBC iPlayer Downloads, which was no longer based on Adobe AIR. On the same date the BBC stopped making programmes available to download in WMV format. The BBC discontinued the RSS feed for iPlayer TV content in October 2014. This stopped some third- party tools such as the get_iplayer content downloader from working. In March 2016 an unofficial site restored access to this information. In September 2015 it was revealed that as part of Tony Hall's \\"open BBC\\" strategy, coming primarily in response to budget cuts across the BBC that will require it to discontinue or factor some of its services, the BBC planned to offer third- party content through iPlayer in the future, as well as launch a spin-off, iPlay, which would be tailored towards children's content. In September 2016, support for older Freeview and Freesat receivers manufactured between 2010 and 2014 was dropped. On 30 October 2018, the BBC relaunched its iPlayer Radio services as BBC Sounds, including a newly designed website and mobile apps.  Television licence requirements  Prior to September 2016, a television licence was not required to stream either BBC television or radio programmes from iPlayer which had already been broadcast, though a licence was still required in order to watch live content. Since 1 September 2016, a television licence is required to view any iPlayer content, regardless of whether it is live or on-demand. Despite the requirement, the enforcement of this measure only uses a trust system, under which users must acknowledge a pop-up window warning of the new requirements. Neither the BBC, nor TV Licensing, announced any specific plans to implement detection measures. In September 2016, the BBC also announced that users would eventually be required to sign in with a BBC ID account to access non-children's content on the service. In May 2017, iPlayer began to encourage users to login with a BBC ID in preparation for this change. Media outlets suggested that the account requirement was intended to help the BBC collect personal information that could be used to trace those who are evading TV Licensing whilst using iPlayer; Andrew Scott, launch director of the ongoing myBBC initiative, stated that the BBC may use account email addresses, along with existing methods, to help identify iPlayer users who do not hold a television licence. However, he repeatedly said that the account system was primarily intended to provide personalization features across BBC properties, such as content recommendations on iPlayer, and the ability to continue watching a programme on one device from where it was left off on another.  Computer platforms  = 'iPlayer 1.0' =  Download service  One of the key features of the original iPlayer download service was the use of peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to enable the distribution of large video files (i.e. TV programmes) to scale effectively. Once downloaded, the content was only playable within the iPlayer itself or Windows Media Player 10 or 11, and subject to digital rights management. In December 2008 the BBC moved to an Adobe AIR-based client that downloaded content via HTTP rather than P2P. The new system replaced the Windows DRM system with Adobe's own. DRM software prevents it being directly copied to another medium (e.g. another computer or CD-ROM), and allowed the BBC to control how long the programmes remain watchable. Programmes were available for download for seven days following broadcast. Once a programme is downloaded a user had thirty days to start watching it; after starting to watch, a programme remained available for the next seven days. Using the online streaming service most programmes became unavailable from the website after 7 days. There was criticism levelled at the iPlayer's use of KService from Kontiki, the peer-to- peer application which continued to use users' bandwidth even after the iPlayer had been shut down. However, the Kontiki P2P system was not used after the new client was introduced in December 2008. The client offered an electronic programme guide (EPG) with listings for both the previous seven and next seven days' programmes; selecting a programme which had already been broadcast began downloading it immediately, while those not yet shown would be downloaded when available. It was not possible to schedule a series to be automatically downloaded when the next episode becomes available.  Online streaming service  A screenshot of the old version of BBC iPlayer streaming page for television programme, Sound The BBC's streaming version of iPlayer, using Adobe Flash software, was launched on 13 December 2007. The BBC made use of the Christmas period to trumpet the new service with the tagline 'Making the unmissable... unmissable', and the service came out of beta on 25 December 2007. Also, seasonal specials were followed routinely throughout the Christmas week with plugs for iPlayer. The streaming version of iPlayer offered replays of programmes broadcast on all national BBC TV channels and S4C during the last seven days. Due to licensing agreements, all international and some privately produced TV shows and movies are not available on iPlayer. = 'iPlayer 2.0' = On 25 June 2008, the BBC announced that they had been developing a new version of the iPlayer based on user feedback ‚Äì it was then called \\"BBC iPlayer 2.0\\". New features included combining the normal television iPlayer with the radio iPlayer, schedules of programmes due to be on the iPlayer, automatic resumption of the last programme watched, an increase in the size of the screen by 25% to 640 pixels wide, RSS feeds of iPlayer data, and a \\"Yesterday's TV\\" function. The beta ran alongside the existing site until 3 July 2008, when a new version replaced it. Later versions have implemented an option of streaming videos in high quality in H.264. A special version of BBC iPlayer was launched 19 December 2008. It was designed for children aged 6 to 12, allowing them to choose from series such as Blue Peter, M.I. High, The Sarah Jane Adventures and more (non-children's programming is restricted).  BBC iPlayer Desktop Manager  At the end of 2008, a newer platform was launched which facilitated use of the new BBC iPlayer Desktop (replacement for Download Manager) and other \\"BBC iPlayer Labs\\" features such as adjustable video windows and user feedback options. In March 2009, the BBC launched a streaming version of the player which needs a 1500 kbit/s minimum connection. On 1 April 2010, this Desktop Manager was updated to version 1.5.15695.18135. The update claimed, amongst other things, optimisation of CPU usage in full screen: 20% to 40% improvement; videos that start to download in the UK should be able to complete downloading abroad; and update to use Adobe Integrated Runtime AIR 1.5.3 which has improved reliability, compatibility and security. = 'iPlayer 3.0' = The iPlayer team released the next-generation of the iPlayer, calling it the iPlayer 3.0 release, on 6 September 2010. It brought integration with various social networking sites to the TV on-demand service, through deals with Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Delicious, Digg and StumbleUpon. BBC ID was also added to allow users to access their iPlayer settings from a variety of devices and Favourite shows so the users get notified when new episodes of their favourited shows are available. The only other feature of the new-look iPlayer discussed was a new embeddable video player, being rolled out across the whole of the BBC's online presence. On 19 June 2012 on the live TV channels it added a rewind to start button. The BBC reported iPlayer users had technical problems with the release of Adobe AIR 3.5, and another with Google Chrome. = iPlayer Downloads = The iPlayer Desktop application was replaced with the simpler iPlayer Downloads application, from which some features were dropped, for example live streaming. = 'The New BBC iPlayer' = On 11 March 2014, the BBC introduced a new version of their BBC iPlayer service called 'The New BBC iPlayer'.Introducing The New BBC iPlayer ‚Äì Retrieved 17-3-14, BBC Internet Blog This new version included a new user interface, and uses the BBC's new 'responsive design,' which means iPlayer can be used on multiple different screen sizes without building separate versions. There is a new home screen along with new channel pages that also use the same responsive design that the rest of the BBC sites now use. The BBC ID is still used to track favourites across the site (however favourites have now been moved to a whole page rather than an individual bar), and new categories have been generated to expand the amount of programmes that can be found by the 42% of visitors who arrive to the iPlayer service without a particular programme in mind. The new pop-out radio player has removed the option to select either high or low bit- rate which may impact users with a data download cap. It no longer restores the volume level or play point from the previous session. BBC iPlayer introduced an Ultra HD trial allowing users with an Ultra HD device to watch with greater picture detail. From December 2016 to January 2017 this was being used to show a 4-minute clip of Planet Earth II in 4K. In early 2016, regional opt-outs for 15 English regions were introduced so regional programming could be watched live.  Television platforms  = BT Vision = On 27 May 2008, BT began to charge BT Vision customers ¬£3 per month for watching BBC Replay, a cut down version of iPlayer offering a more limited 30 hours of BBC programming per week. A spokesman for BT said that its customers had previously been able to view only BBC on-demand content because of \\"technical issues\\". A BBC spokesman said: \\"In line with other TV platforms where BBC programmes are made available on demand, the BBC requires that all public service content should be accessible via the lowest cost subscription tier. In this case, it is BT Replay.\\" From 1 April 2009, the Replay package was included in all of BT Vision's Value Packs but remained available as a separate, ¬£2.93 per month, package to non-subscribers. On 11 November 2010, the BBC and BT announced plans to bring the full BBC iPlayer package to BT Vision, replacing the BBC content on BT Vision's 50-hour \\"TV Replay\\" package. BT introduced BBC iPlayer in a phased release, starting in early December 2010, with all BT Vision customers able to access the service on channel 990 by 22 June 2011. = Digital media receivers = BBC iPlayer downloaded TV programmes can be streamed to televisions via the NetGear EVA8000 and Linksys DMA2200 digital media receivers, through PCs running Windows XP or Vista, with Windows Media Center installed. = FetchTV = On 23 July 2009 the first subscription-free digital terrestrial device to include iPlayer went on sale in UK retailers. The FetchTV Smartbox connects to any broadband connection and gives access to the BBC iPlayer and is a Freeview+ PVR. FetchTV created its own version of the iPlayer, believing it was adhering to BBC guidelines, but support was refused by BBC Future Media and Technology. IP Vision made a formal complaint to the BBC in March 2009: the matter then passed to the BBC Executive's Fair Trading Complaints Panel, which rejected the complaint, and IP Vision then appealed to the BBC Trust. On 22 December 2009 the BBC Trust rejected FetchTV's request to release the product. The Trust's Finance and Compliance Committee (FCC) found that the BBC had given reasonable arguments as to why IP Vision should not be allowed to go ahead with its self-build product. The Trust FCC also rescinded new guidelines introduced by the BBC in October 2009 formalising a ban on third parties building their own commercial iPlayer products . The Trust concluded that the clarification amounted to a significant change to the syndication guidelines which should have been referred to the Trust for approval before publication. = Freesat = BBC iPlayer as displayed by Freesat On 2 November 2009, it was announced that a beta release of BBC iPlayer for Freesat would be released on 7 December 2009 to a limited number of Freesat viewers. On 21 December 2009, iPlayer was made available on a soft launch to Freesat viewers with Humax Foxsat HD receivers only, with an official release on 11 January 2010. It is the final beta version of iPlayer, available via the red button on interactive page 7001. On 20 January 2010, Sony released software update 1.630SA to enable BBC iPlayer on all of their Freesat integrated televisions. On 25 March 2010, iPlayer was added to TechniSat receivers, with an update for Harvard International receivers released on 31 March. However, the Harvard upgrade will not be available on early model standard definition Freesat receivers sold under the Bush, Goodmans and Grundig brands. Harvard International is therefore offering a replacement high definition receiver to anyone affected. Panasonic had aimed to add iPlayer to all of its devices by October 2010, but support was only extended to the 2008 range in September 2011. LG have been unable to update their Freesat integrated LF7700 television and were offering a free Freesat set-top box, however this promotional goodwill gesture ended after a 6-month period. On 16 December 2010, BBC iPlayer was assigned to Freesat channel 901, in addition to access via the BBC Red Button. = Freeview = On 4 May 2009, the managing director of Freeview, Ilse Howling, announced expectations that iPlayer-enabled Freeview boxes would be available in 2009. From 1 April 2011, all new Freeview HD receiver products must include MHEG Interaction Channel (MHEG-IC) as part of D-Book 6.2.1. The move allowed the standard MHEG-5 reliant iPlayer application to be offered from 7 April via the red button on all BBC channels to Freeview HD certified devices. = Roku = On 10 February 2012, Roku launched their streaming devices in the UK for the first time, with BBC iPlayer available from launch. On 26 July 2013, Now TV released a Now TV- branded Roku streaming box, including the BBC iPlayer app. = Sky = On 30 January 2012, it was announced that BBC iPlayer would be added to Sky's On Demand service, arriving on 30 October 2012. The launch reduced the amount paid by the BBC for its carriage on Sky by up to 30%, following the introduction of a clause in BSkyB's Published Price List which reduces the amount paid by a public service broadcaster when one of its channels offers on demand programming to Sky receivers. BBC iPlayer via Sky requires a subscription to Sky TV channels or to Sky+ and a Sky+ HD box with an internet connection. = Televisions and Blu-ray players = In December 2009, Cello Electronics released the Marks & Spencer branded iViewer TV. The television is internet enabled, allowing for the viewing of online content including the BBC iPlayer, which has its own physical button on the remote, although BBC iPlayer HD wasn't available until 2010. On 11 January 2010, the BBC announced that BBC iPlayer would be built directly into TVs that would be widely available in the UK within months. Samsung Electronics became the first major manufacturer to officially announce that its televisions would be updated to include full access to the iPlayer. A BBC iPlayer app is available to download from Samsung Apps for Samsung Smart TV. Sony added BBC iPlayer to its BRAVIA Internet Video service, included in its 2010 range of televisions and Blu-ray players. On 9 September 2010, iPlayer was added to Sony's BRAVIA televisions, having previously only been available on Blu-ray players. Televisions needed a firmware update which could be upgraded over the internet or downloaded onto a USB flash drive for loading directly to the TV. At the time of launch BBC HD content is not available, though high and standard video quality are available on all programmes. = Virgin Media = On 30 April 2008 the iPlayer service was fed directly to Virgin Media's 3.4m digital cable TV customers as part of the company's video-on-demand service. Pressing the 'red button' while watching a BBC channel on TV will bring up the iPlayer service without the user having to access the web. On 29 May 2008 Virgin Media successfully integrated iPlayer with the Virgin Media electronic programme guide. Most BBC shows are now listed alongside other VOD content in Virgin's Catch Up TV section, and through the red button while viewing a BBC channel. There is no charge for watching BBC shows through the iPlayer on Virgin Media. As of 21 July 2008, iPlayer on Virgin Media had received 10.5 million views since its official launch on 1 June 2008. On 26 September 2008 it was revealed that one third of all iPlayer programme views were accessed through Virgin Media. On 1 May 2009, the BBC and Virgin Media announced the launch of HD content via BBC iPlayer on Virgin Media's TV platform, including Robin Hood, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and Later... with Jools Holland. On 2 March 2011, Virgin released an iPlayer application for their TiVo digital video recorder. Unlike the previous implementation, the application streams over the internet rather than utilising Virgin's video-on-demand service, to comply with the BBC's then proposed syndication policy. The change also allows an increase in the amount of programmes available, from around 300 to 700 hours on average, bringing Virgin into line with the iPlayer on connected TV devices. At the same time, Virgin Media were also forced to remove direct access to BBC content on TiVo, meaning that instead of being able to access BBC content through its EPG, Virgin TiVo users instead had to go through the Apps and Games area or press the Red Button from a BBC channel. This access was reimplemented with the release of TiVo update 15.2 in late 2011, which integrated BBC iPlayer once again into the TiVo search and EPG after new guidelines on syndicated content were published by the BBC Trust. = YouView = BBC iPlayer was one of four services available at the launch of YouView in July 2012. At launch the BBC iPlayer app contained options to resume watching recent programmes, access favourites, browse the most popular shows, find similar programmes or more episodes, included integrated search and was the only service to feature HD video.  Game consoles  = PlayStation 3 = Soon after the Wii release, several unofficial PlayStation 3 iPlayer proxy sites arose that used JavaScript to replace the UA string. On 2 December 2008, the BBC provided an official iPlayer application widget for the PS3. Shortly after release, the PS3 accounted for 6% of all iPlayer traffic, making it the third most popular platform used to access the service behind personal computers (85%) and mobile phones and iPods (7%). By January 2010, PS3 usage had risen to 8%, and by November 2010, over 6 million people accessed the iPlayer through the PlayStation 3. In September 2009, the PS3 iPlayer was updated with H.264 playback and full screen content. Future plans for the PS3 iPlayer include features from iPlayer V3 scheduled for late 2010. On 8 August 2011, the application was updated and now includes access to BBC HD, however most content remains unavailable to PS3 users due to DRM restrictions. = PlayStation 4 = In October 2013, Sony confirmed that the PlayStation 4 would have the BBC iPlayer app. Additionally, they announced that BBC iPlayer would continue to be free to access and would not be part of the PlayStation Plus subscription service. = Wii = BBC iPlayer as displayed by the Nintendo Wii On 9 April 2008, the BBC iPlayer was made available to stream video content on the Wii video game console via the Internet Channel. This was enabled by a recoding of the iPlayer to use Flash 7 rather than Flash 9. However, the Autumn 2009 update to the Wii's Internet Channel resulted in the iPlayer no longer working on updated consoles. A BBC iPlayer in the form of a dedicated Wii channel was launched on 18 November 2009. The BBC iPlayer Channel is free to download from the Wii Shop Channel; on 10 February 2015 the BBC announced on their website that they had removed BBC iPlayer from the Wii Shop Channel and terminated the service on the Wii. The BBC cited their policies in resource management as the reason.http://iplayerhelp.external.bbc.co.uk/tv/console/wii/nintendo_wii_closing = Wii U = BBC confirmed that this application was set to be released on Nintendo's Wii U at launch, but due to some issue, it was delayed. In January 2014, BBC stated that this application is set to appear soon on Wii U. On 11 December 2014, Senior product manager Peter Lasko of BBC stated that they hope this application will come to Wii U in early 2015. Without prior notice, however, the app was eventually released for the Nintendo eShop on the Wii U by 28 May 2015. On 31 August 2016, only about 15 months after launch, the BBC iPlayer was de-listed from the Nintendo eShop, and the BBC later confirmed terminating the service by 16 January 2017 for those who already downloaded the app on the Wii U. The BBC cited the end in the licence agreement between them and Nintendo UK as the reason. = Xbox 360 = The BBC and Microsoft had been unable to reach a deal to add the iPlayer to the Xbox 360 for a number of years, because Microsoft's strategy of charging for all content on its Xbox Live platform is incompatible with the BBC's public service remit. Microsoft wanted to ensure that only those paying for Xbox Live Gold accounts could access its added content services. The BBC is not legally allowed to charge the UK public for access to the iPlayer, as the access charges for it are included in the BBC licence fee already. In October 2011, it was announced that the BBC content would be made available to all Xbox Live members in the UK, including Xbox Live Free members. On 20 March 2012, BBC iPlayer became available on Xbox Live; the service includes Kinect functionality. The BBC announced that support for iPlayer on Xbox 360 is to be terminated on 27 March 2019. = Xbox One = In October 2013, Microsoft confirmed that the Xbox One would have the BBC iPlayer app. However, despite Microsoft's claim that the BBC iPlayer app would be available for Xbox One from launch day in the UK, it was not. The BBC commented in December 2013, saying: \\"BBC iPlayer is already available to audiences on over 1,000 devices and platforms in the UK. Whilst we are working to bring BBC iPlayer to Xbox One in the future, we have no further details to share at this time.\\" In January 2014, a report by a BBC programmer announced that an issue with the Kinect sensor had caused the app's delay. He added that all Xbox One apps have to offer gesture and voice controls, as well as Snap features and media achievements. In August 2014, the BBC reported on its blog that they were aiming to release BBC iPlayer on Xbox One by the end of 2014. On 4 December 2014 BBC iPlayer was released.  Mobile platforms  = Android devices = On 23 June 2010, after many months of complaints from Android users, BBC iPlayer officially announced support for the Android platform. Users can navigate to the usual BBC iPlayer website, and a mobile website is displayed. As a result of the BBC's decision to use Adobe Flash Player to handle video playback for Android devices on this website, users must be using Android 2.2 or later (the earliest Android version supported by Flash Player). There was also an unofficial but functional application for the Google Android platform called myPlayer but all BBC content was removed in November 2010 as the service was alleged to be in breach of the BBC terms of use. Another such application ‚Äì beebPlayer ‚Äì was removed from the market in May 2010 at the BBC's request. On 8 February 2011 the BBC announced that Android, alongside the iPad, would be amongst the first two platforms to receive a native iPlayer application. The application was made available via the Android Market to UK users, but as with the earlier mobile website, the application uses Adobe's Flash Player for video playback and as a result is only available for devices running Android 2.2 to 4.0 since Android 4.1 does not support Flash Player. On 4 September 2012 the BBC posted on their internet blog that Android users would soon be able to download programs using the BBC iPlayer app. On 19 September 2012 the BBC reported that an Adobe AIR-based iPlayer application had been developed for Android 4.1, as well as earlier versions. The application, named BBC Media Player, is intended to permit continued iPlayer support for the Android platform. = BlackBerry devices = On 5 November 2010, an official BBC iPlayer app that allows users to stream live television and radio, and catch-up on previously aired content became available for download on BlackBerry OS 5.0 (and higher) devices. A Wi- Fi connection is needed for an \\"optimal viewing experience\\" but 3 and Vodafone are allowing it run on their 3G networks. = iOS devices = On 7 March 2008, a beta version for Apple's iOS devices (iPhone, iPod Touch, and later iPad) was released, allowing streaming over a Wi-Fi connection. An update released on 12 December 2011 allowed streaming over 3G. On 4 September 2012, an update provided the ability to download programmes for up to 30 days, with a seven- day viewing window. The EDGE connectivity on the iPhone, however, is not supported, as it is too slow for streaming video. Non-iPhone users were found to be watching and downloading streams intended for iPhone users allowing them to play them on alternative devices. The BBC modified the iPlayer service on 13 March 2008 to prevent this. Through the month of June 2008 further methods were discovered by iPlayer users to watch and download streams intended for iPhones. A Ruby hole was followed by the BBC introducing XOR encryption on parts of the downloaded files if a genuine iPhone was not detected. The BBC introduced specially crafted web bugs, referrer checks and download chunk limits, such that only devices exhibiting this behaviour, i.e. a genuine iPhone handset, would be able to stream the video content. A cycle of updates and reverse engineering has followed such that all the various streams, both for the iPhone and Flash streaming service, are now able to be downloaded without the need for decryption or DRM circumvention. This has been made possible by various software which can effectively simulate a RTMP Flash client or an iPhone. In early December 2010, the iPhone MP3 access was being changed to use HTTPS. The server checks the client's certificate and only accepts connections for those issued to Apple. This change to the protocol not only prevents access to non-Apple devices but also disables use by a number of early generation iPod Touch devices. On 28 July 2011, BBC Worldwide released an international version of the iPlayer for the iPad. A UK version of the iPlayer for iPad app was also launched, however, this version only allowed streaming video and did not allow any offline viewing. In December 2011 the iPlayer app was extended to work with the iPhone and iPod Touch. = Nokia N96 phone = On 18 September 2008, the BBC announced that a version will become available to the Nokia N96 mobile phone as a download service to allow viewers to watch programmes even when they are out of reach of Wi-Fi or 3G networks. The launch date was set of 1 October 2008. Shortly after on 9 September 2008, even before the BBC Nokia N96 download service had gone live, a method was published to independently download and play the iPlayer N96 3GP stream on other mobiles, Linux and macOS. = Windows Phone = BBC Released BBC iPlayer app on Windows Phone 8 devices on 15 May 2013 as a mobile wrapper UI. Available on the Windows Phone Store. = Additional mobile devices = In early December 2008, iPlayer was updated to include streaming radio and television, and extended to a variety of handsets including Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, Nokia N8, Samsung Omnia, Sony Ericsson C905, Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1, and Sony Ericsson W995.  BBC Store  BBC Store codenamed Project Barcelona launched in the UK and opened the archive to consumers and allowed users to buy a show and download it. BBC Store was approved by the BBC Trust in 2014 and the store launched in 2015. It was initially hosted on a dedicated website but later integrated with BBC iPlayer. BBC Store closed in 2017.  Reception and adoption  Before the launch in December 2007, the BBC had hoped the service would reach half a million users in its first six months. This turned out to be a gross underestimate, as 3.5 million programmes were streamed or downloaded in the first three weeks alone. The Guardian described these figures as \\"remarkably promising\\". In its first year, 2008, growth continued at an impressive rate. By April, the iPlayer accounted for around five percent of all UK Internet traffic, and had approximately five million page views per day by June. In December, it was announced that more than 180 million programmes have been watched on iPlayer since its release. During the BAFTAs in May, the iPlayer won the \\"Interactive Innovation Service/Platform\\" Award, beating Channel 4's 'Big Art Mob' and the Bebo 'Open Media Platform'. The streaming of programmes forms the lion's share of the success, outnumbering downloads eight to one in January 2008, and 97:3 in October 2009. In the month of October 2009, it was revealed that the site experienced 70 million requests and transferred seven petabytes of data. Television formed about two thirds of all requests, with radio making up the rest. Most TV was streamed from pre-recorded footage, whereas live streaming was preferred of radio. Eighty-five percent of requests were from computers, with much of the rest coming from iPods, iPhones and PS3s (from a total of 15 platforms). The most popular TV programme of 2009 was Top Gear, and the most popular radio was that reporting The Ashes. The success of iPlayer may be down to a \\"long tail\\" effect, with users seeking out niche programmes; programmes broadcast on digital channels are doing remarkably well. However, this is expected to change with the introduction of booking programmes to download in advance, and automatic downloading of the next episode. The demands of the iPlayer have met with some concern and criticism from UK ISPs due to the added bandwidth the service will need. Several ISPs, notably Tiscali, have called on the BBC to partially fund network upgrades to cope with iPlayer traffic. The BBC responded by saying that the iPlayer was driving demand for broadband subscriptions. By May 2010, the site was getting 123 million monthly play requests. The service was being used by 40 per cent of online adults in the UK by March 2012. = DRM criticism = During the 2005 and 2006 iPlayer trials, the digital rights management (DRM) system used was based on Microsoft's Windows Media DRM, which led to concerns about cross-platform availability, as this technology is available only for Windows XP. However, some users have managed to get it working using compatibility options in Microsoft's Windows Vista. The BBC emphasises that it \\"has a commitment to platform neutrality and a remit to make its content as widely available as possible\\", and that while the initial trial used a Microsoft-based technology, they are constantly looking for new technologies which would enable them to relax the restriction: Ashley Highfield, then BBC's director of Future Media and Technology, explained that \\"we have always started with the platform that reaches the most number of people and then rolled it out from there\\". They also point out that not all of the content delivered through the iPlayer will be subject to DRM ‚Äì live streaming content, for instance, may not need the same level of control, presumably implying that players for OS X and Linux systems could be developed with a restricted range of content. However, a project was started to enable the iPlayer to work with other platforms via the Wine project. Streaming via the BBC iPlayer website is now available in all browsers supporting Adobe Flash. Also, iPlayer Desktop, which allows downloading programmes for later offline viewing, is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. On 14 August 2007, the Free Software Foundation staged a demonstration outside BBC Television Centre. The FSF's Peter T. Brown criticised the BBC for what he claimed was a break from previous tradition: the insistence that, for the first time, BBC viewers would be forced to use proprietary technology to watch BBC programmes. On 18 February 2010, the BBC updated iPlayer with an SWF verification layer which attempts to close the door on open source implementations of Real Time Messaging Protocol streaming. The attempt was unsuccessful, with most existing open source applications remaining capable of playing or downloading RTMP content from the iPlayer.  Overseas availability  BBC TV productions are paid for by the UK television licence fee and rights agreements with third parties. Thus, all BBC iPlayer TV programmes are accessible from IP addresses allocated to the UK only, . However, most radio programmes can be accessed globally, with the exception of a few programmes, mainly sports broadcasts, that are affected by rights issues. An international version of the iPlayer was launched on 28 July 2011 in eleven western European countries, after receiving the approval of the BBC Trust in November 2010. The international iPlayer takes the form of an iPad application which offers a limited amount of free content, supported by pre-roll ads and sponsorship, but its core business model is subscription (subscription costs approximately ¬£5.00 per month). The global iPlayer app includes some features that are not in the UK version, including the ability to stream shows over 3G as well as Wi-Fi, and a downloading feature to store programmes on one's mobile device for offline viewing. At launch 1,500 hours of content was made available, of which 60% had been produced and commissioned by the BBC, while 30% had been commissioned by the BBC but produced by independents. The other 10% was entirely non-BBC content, including ITV's Primeval, and Channel 4's The Naked Chef and Misfits. Launches in Australia and Canada followed by the end of 2011 as part of what was intended to be a one-year pilot. Although US availability was also anticipated in 2011, an American launch date was never announced. Reports from the summer of 2012 claimed that American cable providers threatened to drop BBC America if the iPlayer, which duplicates much of the content on the cable channel, were made available in the US market. In a statement on the difficulties facing the US rollout, BBC's Head of Communications for Global iPlayer Tessa Matchett said: \\"The United States is a very complex media market. Currently, we have one very successful cable channel in BBC America, and we‚Äôre looking into what options we have to roll out additional platforms in that country.\\" In May 2015, it was announced that the global iPlayer service would be discontinued. In early 2016, BBC Worldwide launched a version of the iPlayer service in Singapore, rebranded as BBC Player. The service is only available to Starhub subscribers who have subscribed to the BBC channels package in Singapore. The service was extended into Malaysia in 2017, however the service can only be accessed by UniFi subscribers who have signed up for the Jumbo pack on Hypp.TV. Access for Streamyx subscribers with the same Hypp.TV package was added a few months later. In March 2017, BBC Worldwide, as part of a joint venture with ITV plc, and BBC America co-owner AMC Networks, launched a new U.S. subscription video-on-demand service known as BritBox.  Humour  In 2009, the BBC's April Fools' joke was a press release announcing the availability of the iPlayer on a specialised toaster, supposedly for users to watch breakfast television. The volume control of the iPlayer goes up to 11, apparently a nod to a scene about an amplifier volume control that goes up to eleven in the rock mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap (1984).

He occasionally did commercial work for local radio and television stations until he was unable to due to his health in the last year of his life. Personal life Metz was born in Cleveland, Ohio. In the 1930 census he is listed as eight years old, living in Cleveland with his father, Russian-born Solomon Metz, his mother, English-born Sarah (Silverman) Metz, and two older sisters, Florance and Mildred. He attended Ohio State University. Little is publicized about Metz's personal life, including his age. In an interview with columnist Tom Dorsey of The Courier- Journal just prior to the end of his radio show in 1993, Metz would only say, \\"Let's just say I'm older than Diane Sawyer and younger than Mike Wallace.\\" Wallace was 75 at the time. Broadcast career \\"El Metzo\\", as he was known to fans, was best known for his work at WHAS (AM) radio, which began in 1946. His call-in show, Metz Here, which began its run on July 20, 1959 (with the title Juniper-5-2385), and ended on June 10, 1993. Though records aren't clear on the subject ‚Äî Larry King began his first local show a year before, but it isn't clear if he took calls on the air ‚Äî Metz Here is believed to be one of the first call-in shows on radio, pioneering a format that is in widespread use today as talk radio. Metz usually featured guests, and was always kind (almost to a fault) to both guests and callers. Thanks to the station's 50,000-watt clear channel AM signal, Metz Here was heard by listeners in 40 states and much of Canada. Metz was also widely seen on local television, serving as co-host and co-producer of Omelet, a morning‚Äìlunchtime talk and news program on WHAS-TV, and was the station's weatherman for 19 years. He also interviewed countless celebrities on the first Saturday in May during WHAS-TV's traditional marathon pre-race show before the Kentucky Derby, where he was a fixture on \\"Millionaire's Row\\", home to well-heeled spectators in the clubhouse of Churchill Downs. Metz later pared down his work to a series of daily 90-second commentaries on WHAS radio. They were discontinued around the turn of the century, and his voice now is heard almost exclusively on local commercials, though he still participated annually in the WHAS Crusade for Children telethon‚Äîas he has since the very first Crusade in 1954. Metz also recorded talking books for the American Printing House for the Blind through 1980. Metz was inducted into the University of Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in 1989. He was also named as a Gold Circle Honoree in 2009 by the Ohio Valley Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Metz died on January 12, 2017 at the age of 95, at a senior-care facility near Louisville where he lived after a rehabilitation stint for injuries suffered in a fall in 2016.

It occurs as glassy, colorless to white prismatic monoclinic crystals. Its Mohs scale hardness is between 3 and 4. It occurs as an alteration mineral in contact metamorphism of limestone. It occurs in association with apophyllite, natrolite, thaumasite, merwinite, spurrite, gehlenite, ettringite, portlandite, hillebrandite, foshagite, brucite and calcite. It was first described in 1925 for an occurrence in the Dutoitspan Mine, Kimberley, South Africa and was named for Alpheus Fuller Williams (1874‚Äì1953), a past official of the De Beers diamond company. Afwillite is typically found in veins of spurrite and it belongs to the nesosilicate sub- class. It is monoclinic, its space group is P2 and its point group is 2. Formation of afwillite It is suggested that afwillite forms in fractured veins of the mineral spurrite. Jennite, afwillite, oyelite and calcite are all minerals that form in layers within spurrite veins. It appears that the afwillite, as well as the calcite, forms from precipitated fluids. The jennite is actually an alteration of the afwillite, but both formed from calcium silicates through hydration.

(2007) Manual of Mineral Science. 23rd Edition, 63, 596 =Structure and properties= Afwillite has a complex monoclinic structure, and the silicon tetrahedra in the crystal structure are held together by hydrogen bonds.Malik, K. M. A & Jeffery J. W. (1976) A re- investigation of the structure of afwillite. Acta Crystallographica, B32, 475. It has perfect cleavage parallel to its (101) and poor cleavage parallel to its (100) faces.Megaw H. D. (1952). The structure of afwillite. Acta Crystallographica, 5, 477. It is biaxial and its 2V angle, the measurement from one optical axis to the other optical axis, is 50 ‚Äì 56 degrees. When viewed under crossed polarizers in a petrographic microscope, it displays first-order orange colors, giving a maximum birefringence of 0.0167 (determined by using the Michel- Levy chart). Afwillite is optically positive. Additionally, it has a prismatic crystal habit. Under a microscope afwillite looks like wollastonite, which is in the same family as afwillite. Afwillite is composed of double chains that consist of calcium and silicon polyhedral connected to each other by sharing corners and edges. This causes continuous sheets to form parallel to its miller index [-101] faces. The sheets are bonded together by hydrogen bonds and are all connected by Ca-Si-O bonds (Malik and Jeffery, 1976). Each calcium atom is in 6-fold octahedral coordination with the oxygen, and the silicon is in 4-fold tetrahedral coordination around the oxygen. Around each silicon there is one OH group and there are three oxygens that neighbor them. The silicon tetrahedra are arranged so that they share an edge with calcium(1), and silicon(2) shares edges with the calcium(2) and calcium(3) polyhedral. The silicon tetrahedra are held together by the OH group and hydrogen bonding occurs between the hydrogen in the OH and the silicon tetrahedra. Hydrogen bonding is caused because the positive ion, hydrogen, is attracted to negatively charge ions which, in this case, are the silicon tetrahedra. Occurrence in concrete Afwillite is one of the calcium silicates that form when Portland cement sets to form concrete.http://www.minersoc.org/pages/Archive- MM/Volume_29/29-216-838.pdf Moody, K.

Farley Michael Francis Farley (March 1, 1863 ‚Äì October 8, 1921) was a U.S. Representative from New York from 1915 to 1917. Biography Farley was born in Birr, County Offaly, Ireland on March 1, 1863. He immigrated to the United States in 1881, and lived in Brooklyn and New York City. Farley became the owner and operator of a tavern on West 22nd Street in New York City, and was later president of the Wine and Liquor Dealers Association of New York County and Manhattan's Central Association of Liquor Dealers. He was elected to the 64th United States Congress as a Democrat, and served from March 4, 1915 to March 3, 1917. Farley was defeated for reelection in 1916 by Fiorello H. La Guardia. In Congress Farley was a proponent of the 1916 Gore- McLemore Resolution. This resolution followed Germany's announcement that it would sink armed enemy merchant ships without warning, and was intended to prevent the United States from being drawn into World War I. As introduced, the Gore-McLemore Resolution asked American citizens not to travel on the armed vessels of any belligerent, and asked for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue passports to Americans intending to travel on such ships. President Woodrow Wilson opposed the resolution, arguing that travel restrictions were an infringement on the rights of individual Americans, and it was tabled by both the House and Senate.United States House of Representatives, History, Art and Archives, The Curious Death of Former New York Congressman Michael Farley from Anthrax, October 8, 1921, retrieved June 28, 2014Facts on File, Gore-McLemore Resolution, retrieved June 28, 2014 Death and burial Farley died as the result of exposure to anthrax contracted from his shaving brush. Upon becoming ill he sought treatment at a hospital and received anti-anthrax serum, but the treatment was unsuccessful. His death publicized the fact that New York public health officials had been waging a campaign to prevent the importation of infected hides and animal hair products. These products, including shaving brushes and toothbrushes, caused 11 deaths in the New York area.Medical Record, Anthrax in New York, October 22, 1921, page 728 Farley was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York.

These languages share irregular morphology with the Tupi and Carib families, and Rodrigues (2000) and Ribeiro connect them all as a Je‚ÄìTupi‚ÄìCarib family. Pache (2018) suggests a distant genetic relationship between Macro-J√™ and Chibchan.Pache, Matthias J. 2018. Contributions to Chibchan Historical Linguistics.

Proto-language Proto-Macro-J√™ is notable for having relatively few consonants and a large vocalic inventory. There are also complex onsets with rhotics, as well as contrastive nasalization for vowels. Phonological inventory of Proto-Macro-J√™ as reconstructed by Nikulin (2020): *Consonants: */p, m, w, t, n, r, c, √±, j, k, ≈ã/ **Complex onsets: */pr, mr, kr, ≈ãr/ *Vowels: */a, √¢, …ô, …ôÃÇ, y, o, √¥, u, e, √™, i, …ôÃÉ, ·ªπ, ≈©, ·∫Ω, ƒ©/ *Maximal syllable structure: */CrVC¬∞/, where /¬∞/ = echo vowel For a list of Proto- Macro-J√™ reconstructions by Nikulin (2020), see the corresponding Portuguese article. Language contact Many Macro-J√™ languages have been in contact with various languages of the Tup√≠-Guaran√≠ family, which resulted in lexical borrowings. For instance, Ribeiro (2012) finds a number of Apy√£wa loanwords in Karaj√° (such as b√®hyra ‚Äòcarrying basket‚Äô, k√≤m·ªπdawyra ‚Äòandu beans‚Äô, h√£rara ‚Äòmacaw (sp.)‚Äô, taraw√® ‚Äòparakeet (sp.)‚Äô, txakohi ‚ÄòTxakohi ceremonial mask‚Äô, hyty ‚Äògarbage (Java√© dialect)‚Äô) as well as several Karaj√° loans in Apy√£wa (t√£t√£ ‚Äòbanana‚Äô, tori ‚ÄòWhite man‚Äô, marara ‚Äòturtle stew‚Äô, ir√£wore ‚ÄòIrabure ceremonial mask‚Äô), Parakan√£, and Asurin√≠ of Trocar√° (sata ‚Äòbanana‚Äô, toria ‚ÄòWhite man‚Äô). Loans from one of the L√≠ngua Geral varieties (L√≠ngua Geral Paulista or L√≠ngua Geral Amaz√¥nica) have been found in Karaj√° (jykyra ‚Äòsalt‚Äô, m·ªπkawa ‚Äòfirearm‚Äô, br√πr√® ‚Äòhoe‚Äô, k√≤m·ªπta ‚Äòbeans‚Äô, mab√®ra ‚Äòpaper (Xambio√° dialect)‚Äô, ƒ©tajuwa ‚Äòmoney (dated)‚Äô), Maxakal√≠ (√£m√£nex ‚Äòpriest‚Äô, t√£y≈©mak ‚Äòmoney‚Äô, k√£m√£nok ‚Äòhorse‚Äô, tapay√µg ‚ÄòBlack man‚Äô), Ritual Maxakal√≠ (k√µn√µmƒ©y ‚Äòboy‚Äô, k√µy√£g ‚Äòwoman‚Äô, petup ‚Äòtobacco‚Äô, pak√µm ‚Äòbanana‚Äô, tapuux ‚Äòforeigner‚Äô, xetukxeka ‚Äòpotato‚Äô), and Krenak (tu≈ã ‚Äòflea‚Äô, krai ‚Äònon-Indigenous person, foreigner‚Äô). Chiquitano has borrowed extensively from an unidentified Tup√≠- Guaran√≠ variety; one example is Chiquitano takones [takoÀàn…õs] ‚Äòsugarcane‚Äô, borrowed from a form close to Paraguayan Guaran√≠ takuare'·∫Ω ‚Äòsugarcane‚Äô. Some Macro-J√™ languages from different branches have secondarily contacted with each other, also resulting in lexical loans. Ribeiro (2012), for instance, identifies several Karaj√° loans in M·∫Ωb√™ng√¥kre, especially in the dialect spoken by the Xikrin group. These loans are thought to have entered M·∫Ωb√™ng√¥kre from the variety spoken by the Xambio√° group of the Karaj√° people. Examples include warikoko (Kayap√≥ dialect) or watkoko (Xikrin dialect) ‚Äòtobacco pipe‚Äô, rara ‚Äòkind of basket‚Äô, wiwi ‚Äòsong, chant‚Äô, bikwa ‚Äòrelative, friend‚Äô, bero ‚Äòpuba flour‚Äô, borrowed from Karaj√° werik√≤k√≤, lala, wii, bik√≤wa, b√®r√≤. Loanwords from Brazilian Portuguese are found in many, if not all, Macro-J√™ languages spoken in Brazil. Examples from Maxakal√≠ include kapex ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô, komenok ‚Äòblanket‚Äô, kapit√µg ‚Äòcaptain‚Äô, p·∫Ωy√µg ‚Äòbeans‚Äô, mug ‚Äòbank‚Äô, tenemiyam ‚ÄòTV‚Äô (borrowed from Portuguese caf√©, cobertor, capit√£o, feij√£o, banco, televis√£o); in Karaj√°, Ribeiro (2012) documents the Portuguese loans nieru ‚Äòmoney‚Äô and marit√≤ ‚Äòsuit, jacket‚Äô (from dinheiro, palet√≥), among others. There is a significant number of loanwords from Chiquitano or from an extinct variety close to Chiquitano in Camba Spanish, including bi ‚Äògenipa‚Äô, masi ‚Äòsquirrel‚Äô, peni ‚Äòlizard‚Äô, peta ‚Äòturtle, tortoise‚Äô, jachi ‚Äòchicha leftover‚Äô, jichi ‚Äòworm; jichi spirit‚Äô, among many others. Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with Arawakan languages due to contact. See also *Je‚ÄìTupi‚ÄìCarib languages *Trans‚ÄìS√£o Francisco languages Further reading *Antunes, M.

He confessed to the murders of five young boys in 1983, as a result of a routine police investigation. Early life Arthur Gary Bishop was born in Hinckley, Utah, the eldest of six brothers. Bishop was raised as a devout Latter-day Saint (Mormon), and was an Eagle Scout and an honor student. When he was 19, Bishop served as a missionary in the Philippines. Bishop was arrested for embezzlement in February 1978 and given a five-year suspended sentence, but he skipped his parole and fled to Salt Lake City, living under the alias \\"Roger Downs.\\" In October 1978, the LDS Church excommunicated Bishop. In Salt Lake City, Bishop, registering under his pseudonym, joined the \\"Big Brother\\" program. No one initially suspected \\"Downs\\" of child molestation, although dozens of children would accuse him of abuse after he was arrested for murder. Murders Bishop killed his first victim, a four-year-old named Alonzo Daniels, on October 14, 1979. Bishop lured the boy from the courtyard of his apartment complex to his own apartment with the promise of free candy. After attempting to sexually assault the child, Bishop drowned him in a bathtub, and subsequently buried the boy's body in the desert. In November 1980, Bishop killed for the second time. At a skating rink, he met an 11-year-old boy named Claude Peterson whom he lured to his apartment on the pretext of buying a pair of roller-skates the boy was trying to sell. Witnesses described the man Peterson had talked with at the roller-skating rink the day prior to his disappearance as being white, aged 25‚Äì35, around 200 pounds and with dark hair. Bishop bludgeoned Peterson to death and his body was buried close to that of Alonzo Daniels outside of Cedar Fort. Bishop was again routinely questioned, but was not considered a suspect in Peterson's disappearance. On October 20, 1981, Bishop killed for the third time; luring a four-year-old named Danny Davis from a supermarket to his home half a block away. Several shoppers recalled a smiling man standing near the child, but could only give vague descriptions as to his appearance. Police launched one of the biggest searches in Salt Lake County history: teams of searchers scoured neighborhoods, searching fields and nearby mountains, divers dredged ponds and lakes, shoppers at the supermarket where Davis vanished agreed to undergo hypnosis in an effort to dislodge greater details of the abductor, fliers were printed offering a $20,000 reward, and the FBI were contacted but were unable to find any trace of the boy. Almost two years later, on June 22, 1983, Bishop struck again, abducting a boy named Troy Ward from a park near his home the day after his sixth birthday. Troy was seen leaving the park on foot with a man just prior to 4 p.m. As with the prior victims, Bishop sexually assaulted him, bludgeoned him and drowned him in his bathtub. One month later, on July 14, Bishop killed his final victim: 13-year- old Graeme Cunningham, who vanished from his neighbourhood prior to embarking upon a camping trip with a friend and an adult chaperone: Arthur Bishop. The boy's disappearance was statewide news. Local police looked into their past reports and found that Bishop (\\"Roger Downs\\") lived in the vicinity of four of the abductions, and knew the fifth child's parents. Police brought \\"Downs\\" in for questioning on the pretext of his assisting officers with their enquiries into Graeme Cunningham's disappearance. At the station, police managed to obtain Downs's real name, and eventually got him to confess to all five murders. The next day, Bishop led the police to three skeletons near Cedar Fort and two more recent corpses near Big Cottonwood Creek. Bishop told police he obtained a thrill from the act of murder, stating: \\"I'd do it again.\\" Trial and execution Bishop was brought to trial on February 27, 1984. During his trial, Bishop claimed that an addiction to child pornography molded his violent sexual fantasies and eventually drove him to act them out. The trial lasted three weeks; on March 19, 1984, Bishop was found guilty of five counts of aggravated murder, five counts of aggravated kidnapping, and one count of sexually abusing a minor, and sentenced to death. Upon receiving his sentence, Bishop apologized to his victims' families and made a request to be executed by lethal injection. After his conviction, he wrote a letter in which he explained the motivation for his crimes: Bishop was executed by lethal injection at Utah State Prison in Point of the Mountain on June 10, 1988. Prior to his execution, he again expressed remorse for his crimes: Victims *Alonzo Daniels, age 4, October 14, 1979 *Claude Kimley Peterson, age 11, November 8, 1980 *Danny Davis, age 4, October 20, 1981 *Troy Ward, age 6, June 22, 1983 *Graeme Cunningham, age 13, July 14, 1983  See also  * List of serial killers in the United States References External links * Contemporary news article pertaining to the execution of Arthur Gary Bishop Category:1952 births Category:1979 murders in the United States Category:1988 deaths Category:20th-century executions by Utah Category:20th-century executions of American people Category:American Mormon missionaries in the Philippines Category:American murderers of children Category:American people convicted of child sexual abuse Category:American people convicted of kidnapping Category:American people convicted of murder Category:Eagle Scouts (Boy Scouts of America) Category:Executed American serial killers Category:Executed people from Utah Category:Former Latter Day Saints Category:Male serial killers Category:Incidents of violence against boys Category:People convicted of embezzlement Category:People convicted of murder by Utah Category:People executed by Utah by lethal injection Category:People excommunicated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:People from Millard County, Utah Category:Violence against men in North America Category:Violence against children ","title":"Arthur Gary Bishop"},{"id":"2508809","text":"James Carl Jobb (born October 8, 1954, Lubbock, TexasTexas Births, 1926‚Äì1995, James Carl Jobb), known professionally as Jim Smith, is an American animator and musician.

While section 25 is also the Charter section that deals most directly with Aboriginal peoples in Canada, it does not create or constitutionalize rights for them. The Charter is a part of the larger Constitution Act, 1982. Aboriginal rights, including treaty rights, receive more direct constitutional protection under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Text Under the heading \\"General,\\" the section reads: Purpose In other words, the Charter must be enforced in a way that does not diminish Aboriginal rights. As the Court of Appeal for Ontario held in R. v. Agawa (1988), the section \\"confers no new rights,\\" but instead \\"shields\\" old ones.R. v. Agawa, (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 266 (Ont. C.A.); This is a stronger recognition for non-Charter rights than section 26's requirement that the Charter cannot be interpreted to deny that non-Charter rights exist, as section 25 specifically states that Aboriginal rights will not only continue to exist but also cannot be derogated by the Charter itself. The distinction came about during the negotiations of the Charter. Section 25's content did not appear in the first version of the Charter, in October 1980, but the original version of what later became section 26 did say that the existence of Aboriginal rights could not be denied. This sparked dramatic protests among Aboriginals, who viewed the proposed constitutional amendments as an insufficient protection of their rights. This persisted until some of their leaders, the National Indian Brotherhood, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, and the Native Council of Canada (now the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples), were appeased by the addition of sections 25 and 35 to the Constitution Act, 1982.Mandel, Michael. The Charter of Rights and the Legalization of Politics in Canada. Revised, Updated and Expanded Edition. (Toronto: Thompson Educational Publishing, Inc., 1994), pp. 354-356. The rights to which section 25 refers explicitly include those in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. They may also include those created by ordinary legislation, like the Indian Act, and constitutional scholar Peter Hogg has speculated that without this section, section 15 (the equality provision) would have possibly threatened these rights, since they are particular to a race. Nevertheless, in the Supreme Court case Corbiere v. Canada (1999), it was found that not all legislative distinctions relating to Aboriginals are protected by section 25, and section 15 was accordingly used to extend voting rights in Aboriginal reserves to Aboriginals who did not live in those reserves. As Hogg observes, what particular rights section 25 protects was in the meantime left uncertain.Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada'. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 631. Section 35 of the Constitution Act, which falls outside the Charter, does constitutionalize some aboriginal rights. As Hogg notes, this makes section 25 altogether less important than section 35, but Corbiere leaves open the possibility that rights not constitutionalized by section 35 can have some protection under section 25.Hogg, 631. Aboriginal self-government The question of how the Charter applies to Aboriginals and Aboriginal government has involved section 25. On the one hand, it has been argued that Aboriginal governments are not bound by the Charter. If section 35 includes a right to self-government, and section 25 ensures Aboriginal rights are not limited by the Charter, then section 25 would also guarantee that self-government is not limited by the Charter.Kent McNeil, \\"Aboriginal Governments and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,\\" (Canada, Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 1996), p. 73. On the other hand, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples once argued that while section 25 guarantees the existence of self- government itself, the powers of such Aboriginal governments will be limited to respect the Charter rights of individual Aboriginals.McNeil, p. 74. Some bands receive a measure of autonomy under the Indian Act, and the consequent powers of the councils would be protected by section 25. Meanwhile, section 32, which bounds the federal and provincial governments to the Charter, may not include the band councils if their authority derives not only from the Indian Act but also tradition.McNeil, pp. 87-89. Amendments to section 25 In 1983, with the passing of the Constitution Amendment Proclamation, 1983, section 25 was amended to expand the protection provided for rights associated with land claims. Whereas the original wording made reference to rights acquired \\"by way of land claim settlement,\\" the current version refers to rights that \\"now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.\\" While ordinarily, section 25 could have been amended with the standard 7/50 amending formula, this change was also carried out with agreement of aboriginal leaders. At the same time, the Constitution Act, 1982 was amended to add section 35.1. This new section suggests that, before section 25 is amended in the future, consultation with aboriginal leaders will again be requested by the prime minister. Case law Scholar Celeste Hutchinson remarks in an article that little has been done with section 25 by the courts. However, she points to the British Columbia Court of Appeal case R. v. Kapp as one that discusses section 25's application. She argues Kapp failed to resolve the issue of whether section 25 is only applied when the Charter is violated, or if applies earlier, when a Charter challenge is raised. Nevertheless, Hutchinson did feel Kapp provided some significant discussion of section 25. In Kapp, Justice Kirkpatrick endorsed the view that section 25 is first considered when a Charter challenge is raised, and made a three-step test asking (1) is the right in question a treaty, Aboriginal or other right related to Aboriginals? (2) if it falls in the \\"other\\" category, does it relate to a part of Aboriginal life? (3) would the remedy possibly given by the Charter limit Aboriginal rights?Hutchinson, Celeste, \\"Case comment on R. v. Kapp: an analytical framework for section 25 of the Charter,\\" McGill Law Journal, 52.1 (Spring 2007): 173(18).

Known for encouraging Confucianism and renovating state affairs at the beginning of his reign, political chaos and his incompetent leadership during the Japanese invasions of Korea marred his later years. Seonjo at Doosan Encyclopedia Biography =Background= King Seonjo was born Yi Yeon in 1552 in Hanseong (today, Seoul), capital of Korea, as the third son of Prince Deokheung (ÎçïÌù•Íµ∞), himself son of King Jungjong and Royal Noble Consort Changbin Ahn-ssi (Ï∞ΩÎπà ÏïàÏî®, 1499‚Äì1549). He was given the title of Prince Haseong. When King Myeongjong died young without an heir, Prince Haseong was the next in the line of succession. Then, by decision of the royal court, he was crowned king in 1567 at the age of 16. Seonjo at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture As a result, his father was promoted to the status of Daewongun (ÎåÄÏõêÍµ∞, 'Great Prince of the Court) Daewongun at Doosan Encyclopedia. An honorary title given to the father of the king who is not a direct heir from the previous king. =Early Reign (1567‚Äì1575)= King Seonjo focused on the improvement of the lives of the common people, as well as rebuilding the nation after the political corruption during the chaotic reign of Yeonsangun and King Jungjong. He encouraged Sarim scholars, who had been persecuted by entrenched aristocrats in four different purges between 1498 and 1545 during reign of Yeosangun and Jungjong. Seonjo continued the political reforms of King Myeongjong, and put many famous Confucian scholars, including Yi Hwang, Yi I, Jeong Cheol, and Yu Seong-ryong, in office. Seonjo also reformed the civil service examination system, particularly the civil official qualification exam. The previous exam was mainly concerned with literature, not with politics or history. The king himself ordered the system to be reformed by increasing the importance of these other subjects. He also restored the reputations of executed scholars such as Jo Gwang-jo, who died in Third Literati Purge of 1519, and denounced the accomplishments of corrupt aristocrats, notably Nam Gon, who instigated the purge under Jungjong and contributed greatly to the corruption of the era. These acts earned the king the respect of the general populace, and the country enjoyed a brief era of peace.The Academy of Korean Studies, Korea through the Ages Vol. 1 p189-p195, The Editor Publishing Co., Seoul, 2005. =Political division and East-West feud (1575‚Äì1592)= Among the scholars King Seonjo called to the government were Sim Ui-gyeom and Kim Hyowon. Sim was a relative of the queen, and heavily conservative. Sim Ui-gyeom at Doosan Encyclopedia Kim was the leading figure of the new generation of officials, and called for liberal reforms. Kim Hyowon at Doosan Encyclopedia The scholars who supported King Seonjo began to split into two factions, headed by Sim and Kim. Members of the two factions even lived in the same neighborhood; Sim's faction lived on west side of the city while Kim's followers gathered on the east side. Consequently, the two factions began to be called the Western Faction and the Easterners ; this two-faction based political system lasted 200 years and later helped bring about the collapse of the dynasty. At first the Westerners earned the favor of the king, since Sim was related to the queen and also had larger support from wealthy nobles. However, their attitudes on reformation and Sim's indecisiveness helped the Easterners take power, and the Westerners fell out of favor. Reforms were accelerated during the first period of influence of the Easterners, but then many Easterners began to urge others to slow down the reforms. The Easterners were once again divided into the Northern and the Southern Faction. Yu Seong-ryong led the Southern faction while the Northerners divided even further after arguments over many issues; the Greater Northerners Faction was an extreme leftist faction, while the Lesser Northerners Faction became less reform-minded than the Greater Northerners Faction, but still more leftist than the Southerners. The political divisions caused the nation to be weakened, since the size of the military was also one of the issues on the reform agenda. Yi I, a neutral conservative, urged the king to increase the size of the army to prepare against future invasions from the Jurchens and Japanese. However, both factions rejected Yi's suggestions, and the size of the army was decreased further since many believed the peaceful period would last. The Jurchens and Japanese used this opportunity to expand their influence in East Asia, resulting in the Seven-Year War, and the foundation of the Qing Dynasty in China, both of which would lead to devastation on the Korean Peninsula. King Seonjo faced many difficulties dealing with both new threats, sending many skilled military commanders to the northern front, while contending with Japanese leaders Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu in the south. However, after Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified Japan, the Japanese soon proved themselves to be the greater threat; and many Koreans began to fear that their country would be taken over by the Japanese. Many officials concerned with the defense of the kingdom urged the king to send delegates to Hideyoshi, their major purpose being to find out whether Hideyoshi was preparing for invasion or not. However, the two government factions could not even agree on this issue of national importance; so a compromise was made and one delegate from each faction was sent to Hideyoshi. When they returned to Korea, their reports only caused more controversy and confusion. Hwang Yun- gil, of the Westerners faction, reported that Hideyoshi was raising huge numbers of troops, Hwang Yun-gil at Doosan Encyclopedia but Kim Seong-Il, of the Easterners faction, told the king that he thought these large forces were not for the war against Korea, since he was trying to complete his reforms quickly to prevent lawlessness and quash the bandits now roaming the countryside. Kim Seong-il at Doosan Encyclopedia Since the Easterners had the bigger voice in government at the time, Hwang's reports were ignored and Seonjo decided not to prepare for war, even though the attitude of Hideyoshi in his letter to Seonjo clearly showed his interest in the conquest of Asia. Japanese invasions of Korea 1592‚Äì1598 at Doosan Encyclopedia =Six-Year War (1592‚Äì1598)= In 1591, after the delegates had returned from Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi sent his own delegates to visit King Seonjo, and asked permission to pass through the Korean Peninsula to invade China, in effect declaring war against the Joseon kingdom. The king was surprised; after refusing the Japanese request he sent a letter to Beijing to alert the Chinese that the Japanese were actually preparing for full-scale war against the Korean-Chinese alliance. He also ordered the construction of many forts in the coastal regions and sent generals Sin Rip and Yi Il to the southern coast to prepare for war. While the Koreans were busy making their preparations, the Japanese manufactured muskets for many of their soldiers, mobilized warriors from across the entire country. Japanese invasions of Korea 1592‚Äì1598 at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture On April 13, 1592, about 700 Japanese ships under Konishi Yukinaga invaded Korea. Konishi easily burned Fort Busan and Fort Donglae, killed commanders Jeong Bal and Song Sang-hyeon and marched northward. On the next day even more troops under Kat≈ç Kiyomasa and Kuroda Nagamasa landed, also marching toward Hanyang. A huge Japanese fleet under Todo Takatora and Kuki Yoshitaka supported them from the sea. General Yi Il faced Kat≈ç Kiyomasa at the Battle of Sangju, which was won by Japanese. Then Yi Il met General Sin Rip, but their combined forces were also defeated at the Battle of Chungju by Konishi Yukinaga. Then Seonjo appointed General Kim Myeong-won as Commander-in-Chief and Field Marshal, and ordered him to defend the capital. Then the king moved to Pyongyang, since the Japanese began to seize the capital. He later moved even further north to the border city of Uiju just before the fall of Pyongyang. While the king was absent from the capital, many people who had lost hope in the government plundered the palace and burned many public buildings. This resulted in even more damage than that perpetrated by the Japanese after they had captured the city. Although the army continued to lose men and battles, the navy successfully cut the Japanese supply line from the sea; Admiral Yi Sun-sin defeated the Japanese fleet several times and did much damage to the supply ships. With the navy blocking supplies, Chinese forces under General Li Rusong arrived, and began to push the Japanese southward, eventually retaking Pyongyang. Konishi Yukinaga successfully blocked a Chinese advance at Battle of Byeokjegwan, and again tried to push the Koreans northward, Battle of Byeokjegwan at Doosan Encyclopedia but the crucial blow came at the Battle of Hangju, where General Gwon Yul defeated the Japanese with a much smaller force. Gwon Yul at Doosan Encyclopedia The Japanese then decided to enter into peace negotiations, while both sides continued fighting. During these negotiations Koreans retook Seoul, but the palaces had all been burnt to the ground, so Seonjo repaired one of the old royal family's houses and renamed it Deoksugung, making it one of the official palaces. Deoksugung at Doosan Encyclopedia The peace negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese ended unsuccessfully, due to a lack of understanding between the two sides and misrepresentation of the Koreans. The Japanese again invaded Korea in 1597; but this time all three nations were ready for war, and the Japanese were not able to advance as easily as in 1592. The Japanese tried to take Hanyang from both land and sea routes. At first the plan seemed to work well when Todo Takatora defeated Admiral Won Gyun at the Battle of Chilchonryang, Won Gyun at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture but the plan was abandoned when the Korean navy under Admiral Yi Sun-sin defeated the Japanese fleet under Todo Takatora in the Battle of Myeongnyang with only 13 ships. The battle effectively ended the war, and in 1598 the Japanese at last withdrew from Korea after the sudden death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Battle of Noryang marked the end of the war, with the last Japanese units under Konishi Yukinaga leaving Korea. =Later days (1598‚Äì1608)= Despite all the efforts put in by Seonjo during the war, such as establishing army training facilities and reforming taxation laws ‚Äì people were awarded with increase of social class, exemption of labor or crimes in return for payment of tax in rice ‚Äì the war left a devastated land and starving people. After the war, his wish of reconstructing the nation was impeded by the political turmoil caused by quarrelling political factions and famine. King Seonjo lost hope in governing the nation, and let his Crown Prince Gwanghaegun rule in his place.

Allen (May 26, 1936 in Kansas City, Missouri ‚Äì September 22, 1999, Colorado Springs) served in the California Assembly from 1982 to 1995, representing part of Orange County, and as Speaker of that body from June 5 to September 14, 1995, before being recalled from office. She was the first woman to be elected to that office. History Before entering politics, Allen owned a successful household lighting store. An amateur actress, she played the title role in the musical \\"Mame\\" in productions by the Westminster Community Theater and Sebastian's West in the early 1970s. Career On November 2, 1982, Allen won the election and became a member of California State Assembly for District 71. Allen defeated Chester B. Wray with 51.6% of the votes. Based in Huntington Beach,Schroeder takes aim at GOP 'turncoat,' prepares recall drive - The Orange County Register Retrieved 2016-12-24. She compiled a relatively conservative record with special attention to environmental protection for her coastal district. Republicans gained a one- vote majority the House in 1995, threatening longtime Democratic Speaker Willie Brown's 15 year hold on power. Brown at first persuaded moderate Republican turned Independent Paul Horcher to keep him in power. Meanwhile, Allen was running in a special election for the State Senate. She became enraged when GOP party leaders endorsed fellow assemblyman (Ross Johnson) with a more conservative voting record than hers, who had moved into the district to run. Allen lost the election. When Horcher was recalled from office and replaced by a more loyal Republican, Speaker Brown convinced a still-angry Allen to vote with Democrats and become Speaker herself, though Brown continued to lead the legislative body as head of the Democratic Caucus. Allen's defection outraged her Republican colleagues, led by Curt Pringle, as well as her Republican constituents, who in November 1995 recalled her from office. Before her removal, Allen resigned as Speaker and handed the gavel over to another Republican who backed Brown, Brian Setencich. However, when Brown resigned his seat in the State Assembly to be sworn in as mayor of San Francisco, Setencich lost that vote, restoring the Republicans' majority electing Pringle as Speaker in January 1996. Setencich himself was defeated for reelection in that June's GOP primary. Following her recall, Allen turned her back on politics and eventually moved away from California, though she did make one last quixotic bid for her old seat in 1998.  Personal life  On September 22, 1999, Allen died of stomach and colon cancer at her home in Colorado Springs. # See also *List of female speakers of legislatures in the United States References  External links  * Doris Allen at ballotpedia.org * Doris Allen at geni.com Category:1936 births Category:1999 deaths Category:California Republicans Category:Deaths from cancer in Colorado Category:Deaths from colorectal cancer Category:Deaths from stomach cancer Category:Politicians from Kansas City, Missouri Category:People from Huntington Beach, California Category:Recalled American politicians Category:Speakers of the California State Assembly Category:Women state legislators in California Category:20th-century American politicians Category:20th-century American women politicians Category:Women legislative speakers Category:Colorado Republicans ","title":"Doris Allen (politician)"},{"id":"2508849","title":"Laura Molina (badminton)"},{"id":"2508854","text":"Michael Donohoe (February 22, 1864 ‚Äì January 17, 1958) of Philadelphia was a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania from 1911 to 1915.

Fairfax Water serves most of the populated areas of Fairfax County, and also serves neighboring communities of Alexandria, Prince William County, Virginia and Loudoun County, Virginia through an interconnection with Virginia American Water, which purchases water through wholesale agreements. It serves drinking water to 1.5 million people. FCWA does not provide sanitary sewer service; this is left to the individual jurisdictions it serves. History FCWA traces its history back to the 1950s. At the time, Fairfax County was a mostly rural county that was quickly becoming suburban, and was served by a number of small, privately owned water companies and private wells. This posed a problem in the first half of the decade, as hot summers and increased demand often caused the wells to run dry. The Alexandria Water Company, which served Alexandria, Virginia and its immediate suburbs, had opened a treatment plant on the Occoquan River near Occoquan, Virginia in 1954, but even that wasn't enough, and both the county government and the city of Alexandria were looking for a solution to the problem together. Fairfax became interested in buying the Annandale Water Company, a medium-sized utility in the heart of Fairfax that, by 1955, served about 3000 homes at the time and had severe problems with water supply. Alexandria was interested in buying Alexandria Water (a privately owned system controlled by American Water Works Company) and its Virginia Water subsidiary, citing its own water supply problems. By the end of the summer, Fairfax was ready to buy the Annandale system when they were blocked from doing so by a lawsuit from a group of subscribers, who were upset that the move may increase their water rates. FCWA has since expanded its filtration capacity several times, with the introduction of new plants at Lorton and Occoquan in the 1960s, and a new plant near Herndon, Virginia in 1982. A new plant that will replace all three of the Lorton and Occoquan plants was under construction and expected to go online in the fall of 2005.

A longbow is not significantly recurved. Its limbs are relatively narrow so that they are circular or D-shaped in cross section. Flatbows can be just as long; the difference is that, in cross-section, a flatbow has limbs that are approximately rectangular. Longbows for hunting and warfare have been made from many different woods by many cultures; in Europe they date from the Paleolithic, and since the Bronze Age were made mainly from yew, or from wych elm if yew was unavailable. The historical longbow was a self bow made of a single piece of wood, but modern longbows may also be made from modern materials or by gluing different timbers together. Organisations that run archery competitions have set out formal definitions for the various classes; many definitions of the longbow would exclude some medieval examples, materials, and techniques of use.The (UK) National Field Archery Association's definition of a longbow The International Field Archery's definition Some archery clubs in the US classify longbows simply as bows with strings that do not come in contact with their limbs. According to the British Longbow Society, the English longbow is made so that its thickness is at least (62.5%) of its width, as in Victorian longbows, and is widest at the handle. This differs from the Medieval longbow, which had a thickness between 33% and 75% of the width. Also, the Victorian longbow does not bend throughout the entire length, as does the medieval longbow. History Illustration of longbowmen from the 14th century The earliest known example of a longbow was found in 1991 in the √ñtztal Alps with a natural mummy known as √ñtzi. His bow was made from yew and was long; the body has been dated to around 3,300 BC. Another bow made from yew, found within some peat in Somerset, England has been dated to 2700‚Äì2600 BC. Forty longbows which date from the 4th century AD have been discovered in a peat bog at Nydam in Denmark.Loades, Mike (2013) The Longbow, Osprey Publishing, (p. 7) In the Middle Ages the Welsh and English were famous for their very powerful longbows, used en masse to great effect against the French in the Hundred Years' War, with notable success at the battles of Cr√©cy (1346), Poitiers (1356), and Agincourt (1415).\\"The Efficacy of the Medieval Longbow: A Reply to Kelly DeVries,\\" War in History 5, no. 2 (1998): 233-42; idem, \\"The Battle of Agincourt\\", The Hundred Years War (Part II): Different Vistas, ed. L. J. Andrew Villalon and Donald J. Kagay (Leiden: Brill, 2008): 37‚Äì132. During the reign of Edward III of England, laws were passed allowing fletchers and bowyers to be impressed into the army and enjoining them to practise archery. The dominance of the longbow on the battlefield continued until the French began to use cannon to break the formations of English archers at the Battle of Formigny (1450) and the Battle of Castillon (1453). Their use continued in the Wars of the Roses however and they survived as a weapon of war in England well beyond the introduction of effective firearms.Nolan, Cathal J (2006), The Age of Wars of Religion, 1000-1650: An Encyclopedia of Global Warfare and Civilization, Volume 2 , Greenwood Press, (pp. 546-547) The average length of arrow shafts recovered from the 1545 sinking of the Mary Rose is . In 1588, the militia was called out in anticipation of an invasion by the Spanish Armada and it included many archers in its ranks; the Kent militia for instance, had 1,662 archers out of 12,654 men mustered.Hutchinson, Robert (2013) The Spanish Armada, Phoenix (Orion Books Ltd) (pp. 65‚Äì66) The first book in English about longbow archery was Toxophilus by Roger Ascham, first published in London in 1545 and dedicated to King Henry VIII. Although firearms supplanted bows in warfare, wooden or fibreglass laminated longbows continue to be used by traditional archers and some tribal societies for recreation and hunting. A longbow has practical advantages compared with a modern recurve or compound bow; it is usually lighter, quicker to prepare for shooting, and shoots more quietly. However, other things being equal, the modern bow will shoot a faster arrow more accurately than the longbow. The Battle of Flodden (1513) was \\"a landmark in the history of archery, as the last battle on English soil to be fought with the longbow as the principal weapon...\\" The Battle of Tippermuir (1644), in Scotland, may have been the last battle involving the longbow in significant numbers. Design and construction Top: Lemonwood, purpleheart and hickory laminated bow. Bottom: Yew selfbow. Because the longbow can be made from a single piece of wood, it can be crafted relatively easily and quickly. Amateur bowyers today can make a longbow in about ten to twenty hours, while highly skilled bowyers, such as those who produced medieval English longbows, can make wooden longbows in just a few hours. One of the simpler longbow designs is known as the self bow, by definition made from a single piece of wood. Traditional English longbows are self bows made from yew wood. The bowstave is cut from the radius of the tree so that sapwood (on the outside of the tree) becomes the back and forms about one third of the total thickness; the remaining two thirds or so is heartwood (50/50 is about the maximum sapwood/heartwood ratio generally used). Yew sapwood is good only in tension, while the heartwood is good in compression. However, compromises must be made when making a yew longbow, as it is difficult to find perfect unblemished yew. The demand for yew bowstaves was such that by the late 16th century mature yew trees were almost extinct in northern Europe.Yew: A History. Hageneder F. Sutton Publishing, 2007. . In other desirable woods such as Osage orange and mulberry the sapwood is almost useless and is normally removed entirely. Longbows, because of their narrow limbs and rounded cross-section (which does not spread out stress within the wood as evenly as a flatbow‚Äôs rectangular cross section), need to be less powerful, longer or of more elastic wood than an equivalent flatbow. In Europe the last approach was used, with yew being the wood of choice, because of its high compressive strength, light weight, and elasticity. Yew is the best widespread European timber that will make good self longbows, (other woods such as Elm can make longbows but require heat treating of the belly and a wider belly/narrower back, while still falling into the definition of a longbow) and has been the main wood used in European bows since Neolithic times. More common and cheaper hard woods, including elm, oak, hickory, ash, hazel and maple, are good for flatbows. A narrow longbow with high draw-weight can be made from these woods, but it is likely to take a permanent bend (known as \\"set\\" or \\"following the string\\") and would probably be outshot by an equivalent made of yew. Wooden laminated longbows can be made by gluing together two or more different pieces of wood. Usually this is done to take advantage of the inherent properties of different woods: some woods can better withstand compression while others are better at withstanding tension. Examples include hickory and lemonwood, or bamboo and yew longbows: hickory or bamboo is used on the back of the bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting) and so is in tension, while the belly (the part facing the archer when shooting) is made of lemonwood or yew and undergoes compression (see bending for a further explanation of stresses in a bending beam). Traditionally made Japanese yumi are also laminated longbows, made from strips of wood: the core of the bow is bamboo, the back and belly are bamboo or hardwood, and hardwood strips are laminated to the bow's sides to prevent twisting. Ready-made laminated longbows are available for purchase. Any wooden bow must have gentle treatment and be protected from excessive damp or dryness. Wooden bows may shoot as well as fiberglass, but they are more easily dented or broken by abuse. Bows made of modern materials can be left strung for longer than wood bows, which may take a large amount of set if not unstrung immediately after use.  Legacy  The longbow and its historical significance, arising from its effective use by the English and Welsh during the Hundred Years' War, have created a lasting legacy for the longbow, which has given its name to modern military equipment, including: *The AH-64D Apache Longbow, an attack helicopter; *The AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire, an air-to- ground missile; and *The Dakota Longbow T-76, a sniper rifle.

Bursera graveolens is found in the seasonally dry tropical forests of Mexico, Venezuela, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and on the Gal√°pagos Islands. The tree belongs to the same family (Burseraceae) as frankincense and myrrh. It is widely used in ritual purification and as folk medicine for stomach ache, as a sudorific, and as liniment for rheumatism. Aged heartwood is rich in terpenes such as limonene and Œ±-terpineol. Conservation In 2006, the government of Peru listed Bursera graveolens as \\"In Critical Danger\\" (En Peligro Critico (CR)) under Decree 043-2006-AG, banning the cutting of live trees and allowing only for the collection of naturally fallen or dead trees. However, in 2014, it was removed from the SERFOR (National Forest and Wildlife Service) list of protected species. Illegal logging is a regular occurrence in northwestern Peru due to high demand. In 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) stated Bursera graveolens conservation status as \\"stable\\".  Uses  =Modern uses= Palo santo is used to produce burning sticks and incense. Production of essential oil is attracting most of the modern interest. Chemical composition, as reflected by aroma, is variable. The essential oil of palo santo is generally termed \\"Palo Santo Oil\\", and has received the Chemical Abstract Services number, 959130-05-3. When used as an ingredient in cosmetics the INCI name \\"Bursera graveolens wood oil\\" should be listed. =Ethnobotanical uses= The use of palo santo from B. graveolens is traditional in South America, especially in Ecuador. According to the local customs, it is used against the \\"mala energ√≠a\\" (bad energy) (\\"Palo santo para limpiar tu casa de la mala energia, palo santo para la buena suerte\\" or \\"Palo santo to clean your house of bad energy, palo santo for good luck\\"), which may sometimes refer to clinical disease. Its use reportedly dates back to the Inca era. Palo santo is common today as a type of incense, which gives off an aroma reminiscent of baked apples or burnt sugar. Palo santo oil was used during the time of the Incas for its reputed spiritual purifying properties. Today, palo santo oil may be applied to the body (such as at the base of the skull or on the spine) to increase relaxation, similar to aromatherapy. Palo santo may be burned, similar to incense, by lighting shavings of palo santo wood. In Peru, a shaman, or medicine man, reportedly lights palo santo sticks and the rising smoke will enter the \\"energy field\\" of ritual participants to \\"clear misfortune, negative thoughtprints, and 'evil spirits'\\". Peruvians harvest fallen branches and twigs of the B. graveolens tree, a practice that is regulated by the government of Peru, so trees are not cut for wood harvesting. The charcoal of palo santo sticks can also be used for ritual smudging. Yoga studios and witchcraft practitioners utilize the substance.Bosker, Bianca.

Biography O'Brien was born in Ireland in County Kings (since renamed). He attended the common schools, then immigrated to the United States in 1861. O'Brien served as alderman of New York City in 1864 and 1866, then became Sheriff of New York County, New York in 1867. O'Brien directly contributed to the downfall of the Tweed ring of Tammany Hall by providing city financial accounts to the New York Times in 1871. James Watson, who was a county auditor in Comptroller Dick Connolly's office and who also held and recorded the ring's books, died a week after his head was smashed by a horse in a sleigh accident on January 21, 1871. Although Tweed guarded Watson's estate in the week prior to Watson's death, and although another ring member attempted to destroy Watson's records, a replacement auditor, Matthew O'Rourke, associated with the former sheriff James O'Brien, provided city financial accounts to O'Brien, who then forwarded the accounts to the New York Times. The New York Times, at that time the only Republican associated paper in the city, was then able to reinforce stories they had previously published against the ring. O'Brien served in the New York State Senate in 1872 and 1873, during which time he founded the Apollo Hall Democracy. He was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of New York City in 1873 and an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1874 to the Forty-fourth Congress. Richard Croker was charged with the murder of John McKenna, a lieutenant of James O'Brien during a fight on election day of 1874 with O'Brien's rival political group. O'Brien was running for Congress against the Tammany-backed Abram S. Hewitt. John Kelly, the new Tammany Hall boss, attended the trial and Croker was freed after the jury was undecided. O'Brien was then elected as an Independent Democrat to the Forty-sixth Congress (March 4, 1879 - March 3, 1881), but was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1880. He then worked as a stock broker until his death. He died in Manhattan on March 5, 1907 at the age of 65. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Queens.

His services enabled the British Government to take measures which led to the fiasco of the Canadian invasion of 1870 and Kiel's surrender in 1871, and he supplied full details concerning the various Irish-American associations, in which he himself was a prominent member. His infiltration of the Fenian Brotherhood and subsequent reports and espionage greatly aided in upholding the British Empire in Canada from the Fenian raids which took place from 1866 - 1871. For twenty-five years he lived in Detroit, Michigan and other places in the United States, paying occasional visits to Europe, and all the time carrying his life in his hand. Early career Beach was born in Colchester, England. He had an adventurous character, and when nineteen years old went to Paris, where he found employment in business connected with America. Army life Infected with the excitement of the American Civil War, he crossed the Atlantic in 1861 and enlisted in the Northern army, taking the name of Henri Le Caron. In 1864, he married a young lady who had helped him to escape from some Confederate marauders; and by the end of the war he rose to the rank of major. In 1865, through a companion in arms named John O'Neill, he was brought into contact with Fenianism, and having learnt of the Fenian plot against Canada (the Fenian raids), he mentioned the designs when writing home to his father in England. Beach's father told his local M.P., who in turn told the Home Secretary, and the latter asked Beach to arrange for further information. Irish connections He was proficient in medicine, among other qualifications for this post, and he remained for years on intimate terms with the most extreme men in the Fenian organization. He was in the secrets of the \\"new departure\\" in 1879-1881, and in the latter year had an interview with Charles Stewart Parnell at the House of Commons, when the Irish leader allegedly spoke sympathetically of an armed revolution in Ireland.  End of career  The Parnell Commission of 1889 put an end to Beach's spying career. He was subpoenaed by The Times, and in the witness-box the whole story came out, all the efforts of Sir Charles Russell in cross-examination failing to shake his testimony. Nevertheless, The Times lost the case, Beach's career, for good or evil, was at an end, and Parnell, who had always insisted that he was opposed to violence, was completely exonerated.  Autobiography  Beach published the story of his life, Twenty-five Years in the Secret Service, in 1892 and it had an immense circulation, but he had to be constantly guarded, his acquaintances were hampered from seeing him, and he was the victim of a painful disease, peritonitis, from which he died on 1 April 1894.

After the war, J2F Ducks saw service with independent civilian operators, as well as the armed forces of Colombia and Mexico. The J2F was an improved version of the earlier JF Duck, the main differences being a longer float and a more-powerful engine (900 horsepower versus 775).Allen 1983, p. 49. Development The J2F-1 Duck first flew on 2 April 1936, powered by a 750 hp (559 kW) Wright R-1820 Cyclone, and was delivered to the U.S. Navy on the same day. The J2F-2 had an uprated Wright Cyclone engine of 790 hp (589 kW). Twenty J2F-3 variants were built in 1939 for use by the Navy as executive transports with plush interiors. Due to pressure of work following the United States entry into the war in 1941, production of the J2F Duck was transferred to the Columbia Aircraft Corp of New York. They produced 330 aircraft for the Navy and U.S. Coast Guard.Jordan, Corey C. \\"Grumman's Ascendency: Chapter Two.\\" Planes and Pilots Of World War Two, 2000. Retrieved: 22 July 2011. If standard Navy nomenclature practice had been followed, these would have been designated JL-1s, but it was not, and all Columbia-produced airframes were delivered as J2F-6s.Swanborough, Gordon, and Bowers, Peter M., \\"United States Navy Aircraft since 1911\\", Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 1976, Library of Congress card number 90-60097, , page 221. Several surplus Navy Ducks were converted for use by the United States Air Force in the air-sea rescue role as the OA-12 in 1948. Design The J2F was an equal-span single-bay biplane with a large monocoque central float which also housed the retractable main landing gear, a similar design to the Leroy Grumman-designed landing gear first used for Grover Loening's early amphibious biplane designs, and later adopted for the Grumman FF fighter biplane. The aircraft had strut-mounted stabilizer floats beneath each lower wing. A crew of two or three were carried in tandem cockpits, forward for the pilot and rear for an observer with room for a radio operator if required. It had a cabin in the fuselage for two passengers or a stretcher. The Duck's main pontoon was blended into the fuselage, making it almost a flying boat despite its similarity to a conventional landplane which has been float-equipped. This configuration was shared with the earlier Loening OL, Grumman having acquired the rights to Loening's hull, float, and undercarriage designs.Allen 1983, p. 47. Like the F4F Wildcat, its narrow-tracked landing gear was hand-cranked. Operational history The J2F was used by the U.S. Navy, Marines, Army Air Forces, and Coast Guard. Apart from general utility and light transport duties, its missions included mapping, scouting/observation, anti-submarine patrol, air-sea rescue work, photographic surveys, reconnaissance, and target tug. J2Fs of the utility squadron of US Patrol Wing 10 were destroyed at Mariveles Naval Section Base, Philippines, by a Japanese air raid on 5 January 1942.Alsleben, Allan. \\"US Patrol Wing 10 in the Dutch East Indies, 1942.\\" Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941‚Äì1942, 2000.

The only Duck to survive the attack had a dead engine but had been concealed at Cabcaben airfield during the Battle of Bataan, to be repaired afterwards with a cylinder removed from a destroyed J2F-4 submerged in Manila Bay. Following repairs the J2F-4 departed after midnight on 9 April 1942, overloaded with five passengers and the pilot, becoming the last aircraft to depart Bataan before the surrender of the Bataan to the Japanese only hours later.

She was the wife of Sir Paul Hasluck, Governor-General of Australia. Biography She was born in Perth, Western Australia, attended Presbyterian Ladies' College from 1916 to 1918, followed by Perth College, and was a graduate of the University of Western Australia. In 1932 she married Paul Hasluck, who (as Sir Paul) was Governor-General of Australia 1969‚Äì1974. In 1974 he was offered an extension of his term by the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, and he was willing to serve an extra two years, but Lady Hasluck (as she then was) refused to remain at Yarralumla longer than the originally agreed five years.'How one strong woman changed the course of Australian history, The Age, 2 January 2010 Whitlam then appointed Sir John Kerr. Historians of the period are certain that if Hasluck had still been Governor- General in 1975, as he would have been had his wife not intervened, the constitutional crisis of that year would have ended differently. Hasluck himself implied this in his book, The Office of Governor-General and also in the Queale Lecture. In the 1978 Queen's Birthday Honours, Lady Hasluck was appointed the first Dame of the Order of Australia for \\"pre-eminent achievement in the fields of literature and history and for extraordinary and meritorious public service to Australia\\". Dame Alexandra Hasluck's published works included talks to the Royal West Australian Historical Society as well as 11 books and numerous articles. One of her achievements was the editing of Audrey Tennyson's Vice-Regal Days, written by Lady (Audrey) Tennyson, wife of Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson, who was Governor-General from 1903 to 1904. She died in 1993. Dame Alexandra and Sir Paul Hasluck are joint eponyms of the Western Australian Federal House of Representatives Division of Hasluck.

The monument enshrines the severed noses of at least 38,000 Koreans killed during Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasions. The shrine is located just to the west of Toyokuni Shrine, the Shinto shrine honoring Hideyoshi in Kyoto. History left Traditionally, Japanese warriors brought back the heads of enemies slain on the battlefield as proof of their deeds. Nose collection in lieu of heads became a feature of the second Korean invasion. Originally, remuneration was paid to soldiers by their daimy≈ç commanders based on the severed heads upon submission to collection stations, where inspectors meticulously counted, recorded, salted and packed the heads bound for Japan. However, because of the number of civilians killed along with soldiers, and crowded conditions on the ships that transported troops, it was far easier to just bring back noses instead of whole heads. Hideyoshi was especially insistent upon receiving noses of people his samurai had killed as proof that his men really were killing people in Korea.Turnbull, Stephen The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592-98, London: Osprey, 2008 p.81. Japanese chroniclers on the second invading campaign mention that the ears hacked off the faces of the massacred were also of ordinary civilians mostly in the provinces Gyeongsang, Jeolla, and Chungcheong. In the second invasion Hideyoshi's orders were thus: One hundred and sixty-thousand Japanese troops had gone to Korea where they had taken 185,738 Korean heads and 29,014 Chinese ones, a grand total of 214,752. As some might have been discarded, it is impossible to enumerate how many were killed in total during the war. The Mimizuka was dedicated September 28, 1597. Though the exact reasons as to its construction are not entirely known, scholars contend that during the second Japanese invasion of Korea in 1597, Toyotomi Hideyoshi demanded his commanders show receipts of their martial valor in the destruction, dispatching congratulatory letters to his high-ranking warriors in the field as evidence of their service. Hideyoshi then ordered the relics entombed in a shrine on the grounds of Hokoji Temple, and set Buddhist priests to work praying for the repose of the souls of the hundreds of thousands of Koreans from whose bodies they had come; an act that chief priest Saish≈ç J≈çtai (1548‚Äì1608) in a fit of toadyism would hail as a sign of Hideyoshi's \\"great mercy and compassion.\\" The shrine initially was known as , Mound of Noses, but several decades later this would come to be regarded as too cruel-sounding a name, and would be changed to the more euphonious but inaccurate , Mound of Ears, the misnomer by which it is known to this day. Other nose tombs dating from the same period are found elsewhere in Japan, such as at Okayama. =Effect on modern foreign relations= The Mimizuka is almost unknown to the Japanese public unlike to the Koreans. The British historian Stephen Turnbull called the Mimizuka \\"...Kyoto's least mentioned and most often avoided tourist attraction\\".Turnbull, Stephen The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592-98, London: Osprey, 2008 p.81. A plaque, which was later removed, stood in front of the Ear Mound in the 1960s with the passage, \\"One cannot say that cutting off noses was so atrocious by the standard of the time.\\" Most guidebooks do not mention the Ear Mound, and only a few Japanese or foreign tourists visit the site. The majority of visiting tourists are Korean ‚Äì Korean tour buses are often seen parked near the Ear Mound. In 1982, not a single Japanese school textbook mentioned the Ear Mound. As of 1997, the mound is referred to in about half of all high-school history textbooks according to Shigeo Shimoyama, an official of Jikkyo, a publishing company. The publisher released the first Japanese text book mentioning the Ear Mound in the mid-1980s. The Education Ministry of Japan at that time opposed the description as \\"too vivid\\" and pressured the publisher to reduce the tone and also to praise Hideyoshi for religiously dedicating the Ear Mound to store the spirits of the killed people. In the 1970s under the Park Chung- hee administration, some of the officials of the South Korean government asked Japan to level the monument. However, most South Koreans said that the mound should stay in Japan as a reminder of past savagery. Activity since the 1990s is aptly conveyed thus: On September 28, 1997, the 400th anniversary of the Mimizuka, a ceremony was held in respect for those killed, which people of all nationalities and faiths attended. The current caretaker of Mimizuka as of August 2009 is Shimizu Shirou (Ê∏ÖÊ∞¥ÂõõÈÉé).

It is bordered to the east by the Darling Scarp. Both Ellenbrook and Jane Brook lie within the region and discharge into the Swan River. There are seven suburbs within the region: Baskerville, Belhus, Caversham, Henley Brook, Herne Hill, Millendon and West Swan. It is part of the City of Swan local government area. The Swan Valley Australian Geographical Indication is a sub-region of the larger Swan District wine region. Swan Valley was registered on 6 January 2003 following Swan District being registered on 10 December 1998.  History  The indigenous heritage of the region is over 40,000 years old. The Noongar Aboriginal people of the Wadjuk tribe, who are the traditional landowners of the Swan Valley, lived here before the colonial invasion began. As per the beliefs of the native people, the Swan Valley was created by a serpent named Wagyl who is still believed to be living under the Swan River. The area was explored in 1827 by Captain James Stirling later to become governor of the Swan River Colony. Stirling was so impressed with the area that he wrote in his diary:Explorers' Diaries of Western Australia All Saints Church in the Swan Valley When Stirling returned to establish the colony in 1829 he created three settlements: Fremantle as the port; Perth as the major commercial and political centre; and Guildford on the southern end of the Swan Valley region. Descendants of many of the early families still reside within the shire. Within the first ten years, two of Perth's oldest churches had been built there: the first was St. Mary's Church in Middle Swan, followed by All Saints Church, Henley Brook built at the site of Stirling's 1827 camp. St. Mary's was rebuilt in 1869 but All Saints still retains its original structure and is thus Perth's oldest standing church.  Attractions  The Swan Valley is noted for its fertile soil, uncommon in the Perth region, and tourism-based destinations. These include numerous wineries such as the huge complex at Houghton, the state's biggest producer, and Sandalford and also many small family-owned concerns. There are also several microbreweries and rum distilleries. The Swan Valley is served by roadside local-produce stalls which sell seasonal produce throughout the year. Grapes, melons, asparagus, stone fruits, citrus and strawberries are grown and sold in the Swan Valley. Swan Valley has a food element in the form of a chocolate factory, coffee roasters, several beekeepers, a lavender farm, olive groves, a goat farm, cheese farms, dried-fruit producers, restaurants and cafes. During October for many years the annual \\"Spring in the Valley\\" weekend took place; it was one of Australia's largest wine and food festivals. This community event ceased around 2009 due to excessive anti-social behaviour of some participants. However some of the smaller wineries in the area have banded together and still present some small scale events in the valley during spring.

In 1937 he began his prolific pulp writing career, with a sale to Weird Tales. He wrote many stories for Uncanny Tales, a Canadian pulp magazine. He was the author of some two-dozen paperback books, largely of the true-crime variety. Kelley claimed to be ‚Äòking of the Canadian pulp writers‚Äô and ‚Äòthe fastest author in the East‚Äô. He died in Toronto. Kelley claimed that when he began a novel he had no idea how it would end, and had used 30 pseudonyms.

After passing with distinction through King's College, London, he joined the staff of the Geological Survey in 1842, and was set to work in Radnorshire. From this county he was shortly afterwards transferred to the Cotteswold district, which he examined up to Bath, and afterwards surveyed a large part of Dorset, Wiltshire, and Hampshire, with the Isle of Wight, besides some of the Wealden area, Berkshire, and Essex, rising ultimately in 1872 to the position of director for England and Wales. His field work was admirable in quality, for he was no less patient than accurate in unravelling a complicated district ‚Äî one of those men, in short, who lay the foundations on which his successors can build, and whose services to British geology are more lasting than showy. He retired from the survey in July 1888 and died on 14 June 1889. He was elected F.G.S. in 1843 and F.R.S. in 1862, was an honorary member of sundry societies, and received the order of SS. Maurice and Lazarus. Works His separate papers are few in number ‚Äî about eight ‚Äî and during his later years he suffered from deafness, which prevented him from taking part in the business of societies. But his mark is made on several of the maps and other publications of the Geological Survey, more especially in the memoir of parts of Berkshire and Hampshire (a joint production), and in that admirable one, The Geology of the Isle of Wight, almost all of which was from his pen. He contributed also to sundry publications, official and otherwise, and wrote or edited the following books: 1. Glossary of Mineralogy, 1861. 2. Underground Life (translation, with additions of La Vie Souterraine, by L. Simonin), 1869. 3. The World before the Deluge (a translation, with additions, of a work by L. Figuier), 1872.

Eric and Josh and Paul have also been recording some material in a new project called, Timbre Barons. Paul Pugliese is playing in the surfy, gypsy jazz trio \\"Johnny NordstrUm and the Retailers.\\" Dave E. Martin joined up with the Pop/Rock band Black Whales in September opf 2010. He was asked to fill in on keyboards for a show after Mike Bayer decided to leave the band to focus on his other music projects. Black Whales released their debut full-length record \\"Shangri-La Indeed!\\"on June 28, 2011. Martin contributed keyboards to 6 tracks and a musical saw track that was looped at the beginning of the album's opening song. Sonny Votolato recently played bass on his brother Rocky's \\"Television Of Saints\\" record. In March 2012, Sonny, Paul and Dave reunited to form the new band \\"Bye Gones\\" with Drummer Abdon Valdez. Their first show was played at Sweet Lou's in North Seattle on August 18, 2012. Bye Gones was a very short lived project and came to an end around October 2012. However, Martin has continued to write songs for yet another project under the moniker, Ghost Pains along with Absolute Monarchs drummer Michael Stubz.

The National Finals Rodeo, organized by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), is the premier championship rodeo event in the United States. The NFR showcases the talents of the PRCA's top 15 money-winners in each event as they compete for the world title. The NFR is held each year in the first full week of December, at the Thomas & Mack Center on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. (UNLV) and is aired live on The Cowboy Channel. Cowboy Christmas, a cowboy gift show, is held concurrent with the rodeo at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Due to COVID-19, the rodeo has been temporarily relocated to the Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. The NFR is scheduled to take place from December 3 through December 12, 2020. Since the rodeo uses 'special dirt', the dirt is stored on the UNLV campus for use in the next NFR. Events The NFR is the final rodeo event of the PRCA season. World championship titles are awarded to the individuals who earn the most money in his or her event throughout the year. 7 events and 10 championships are sanctioned by the PRCA: Steer roping is publicized separately and its finals are held separately at the National Finals Steer Roping. Barrel racing is sanctioned by the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA). * Bronc riding - there are two divisions in rodeo, bareback bronc riding, where the rider is only allowed to hang onto a bucking horse with a type of surcingle called a \\"rigging\\"; and saddle bronc riding, where the rider uses a specialized western saddle without a horn (for safety) and hangs onto a heavy lead rope, called a bronc rein, which is attached to a halter on the horse. *Tie-Down Roping - also called calf roping, is based on ranch work in which calves are roped for branding, medical treatment, or other purposes. It is the oldest of rodeo's timed events. The cowboy ropes a running calf around the neck with a lariat, and his horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws it to the ground and ties three feet together. (If the calf falls when roped, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work.) The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope. A well-trained calf-roping horse will slowly back up while the cowboy ties the calf, to help keep the lariat snug. *Barrel Racing - is a timed speed and agility event. In barrel racing, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In professional, collegiate and high school rodeo, barrel racing is an exclusively women's sport, though men and boys occasionally compete at local O-Mok-See competition. Barrel racing takes place with other PRCA sanctioned events, but it is sanctioned by the Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA). Results are shown on that web site. *Steer Wrestling - Also known as \\"Bulldogging,\\" is a rodeo event where the rider jumps off his horse onto a Corriente steer and 'wrestles' it to the ground by grabbing it by the horns. This is probably the single most physically dangerous event in rodeo for the cowboy, who runs a high risk of jumping off a running horse head first and missing the steer, or of having the thrown steer land on top of him, sometimes horns first. *Team Roping - also called \\"heading and heeling,\\" is the only rodeo event where men and women riders compete together. Two people capture and restrain a full-grown steer. One horse and rider, the \\"header,\\" lassos a running steer's horns, while the other horse and rider, the \\"heeler,\\" lassos the steer's two hind legs. Once the animal is captured, the riders face each other and lightly pull the steer between them, so that both ropes are taut. This technique originated from methods of capture and restraint for treatment used on a ranch. *Bull Riding - an event where the cowboys ride full-grown bulls instead of horses. Although skills and equipment similar to those needed for bareback bronc riding are required, the event differs considerably from horse riding competition due to the danger involved. Because bulls are unpredictable and may attack a fallen rider, rodeo clowns, now known as \\"bullfighters\\", work during bull-riding competition to distract the bulls and help prevent injury to competitors. * Steer Roping - is based on tie-down roping. Instead of a calf, the cowboy must catch and tie down a large steer (approximately 450 to 600 pounds). Unlike tie-down roping, the cowboy must first rope the steer around its horns. The steer's horns are wrapped and then reinforced with rebar. The cowboy must then toss the rope over the steer's right hip. Then he rides leftward which brings the steer down to the ground. Once the steer is on his side and the rope is tight, then he can dismount. He will run to the steer in order to tie any three legs together. As in tie-down roping, the tie must hold for six seconds.2018 PRCA Media Guide\\" \\"Introduction, Event descriptions, p. 17. * Steer riding - a rough stock event for boys and girls where children ride steers, usually in a manner similar to bulls. Ages vary by region, as there is no national rule set for this event, but generally participants are at least eight years old and compete through about age 14. It is a training event for bronc riding and bull riding. *All- Around - The All-Around Cowboy is actually an award, not an event. It is awarded to the highest money winner in two or more events. * Barrel Racing - is a timed speed and agility event. In barrel racing, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In professional, collegiate and high school rodeo, barrel racing is an exclusively women's sport, though men and boys occasionally compete at local O-Mok-See competition. Barrel racing takes place with other PRCA sanctioned events, but it is sanctioned by the WPRA. Results are shown on that website. The All Around title is awarded at the end of the NFR to the highest-earning cowboy who has regularly competed in more than one event during the year. In addition to world championships, an average winner is crowned in each event. Since this event is extremely popular, it sells out all seats for all of the events. Many casinos carry the events live in their sports books or host special parties to accommodate all of the fans in town who can not get tickets for the events. Most of the major hotels and casinos book special entertainment into their showrooms with a country theme offering many of the regular shows an extended break. Format and prize structure The NFR consists of ten days, each of which has a competition, or \\"go-round\\", in each event with its own prizes. In addition, each event has a separate set of prizes for having the best combined results over the ten days, referred to as \\"the average.\\" The payouts are based on the total prize pool. For every $208,000 in the prize pool, the top six in each go-round receive $620, $490, $370, $260, $160, and $100, and the top eight in the average receive $1590, $1290, $1020, $750, $540, $390, $270, and $150. In 2012, the prize pool was $6,125,000, so each go-round paid $18,257 for first, $14,429 for second, $10,895 for third, $7656 for fourth, $4712 for fifth, and $2945 for sixth, and each event's average paid $46,821 for first, $37,987 for second, $30,036 for third, $22,085 for fourth, $15,901 for fifth, $11,484 for sixth, $7951 for seventh, and $4417 for eighth. History The National Finals Rodeo (NFR), known popularly as the \\"Super Bowl of rodeo,\\" is a championship event held annually by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). That organization established the NFR in 1958 in order to determine the world champion in each of rodeo's seven main events: tie-down roping, steer wrestling, bull riding, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, barrel racing and team roping. The world championship steer roping competition, the NFSR, has always been held separately from the regular NFR. The National Finals Steer Roping are currently held at the Kansas Star Arena. The National Finals Rodeo showcases the talents of the PRCA's top fifteen money-winners in each event as they compete for the world title. The inaugural NFR was held in Dallas, Texas in 1959 and continued at that venue through 1961. From 1962 to 1964, Los Angeles, California hosted the competition. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma successfully bid in 1964 to be the host city. In 1965 the first NFR at State Fair Arena drew 47,027 fans. NFR remained there through 1978 and through 1984 at the Myriad Convention Center, bringing Oklahoma merchants an estimated annual revenue of $8 million. In 1984, Las Vegas bid for the event. Although the Oklahoma City Council considered building a new $30 million arena at the State Fairgrounds, the Las Vegas bid won. Since 1985 the NFR has been held in the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. The NFR has become Thomas & Mack Center arena's biggest client, bringing in more than 170,000 fans during the 10-day event. In 2001 a landmark sponsorship agreement was achieved and Wrangler became the first title sponsor of the National Finals Rodeo. The agreement, part of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association's continuing effort to elevate professional rodeo to a new level, was made by PRCA Commissioner Steven J. Hatchell. Oklahoma City has bid to return the NFR to Oklahoma, but is always outbid by the deep pockets of Las Vegas. Starting in 2011, Oklahoma City hosted the National Circuit Finals Rodeo (RNCFR), which is the Finals for the PRCA's semi-pro series. This was seen as a step towards proving the crowds exist to bring the NFR back to Oklahoma City when Las Vegas' contract was scheduled to end in 2014.DNCFR moves to Oklahoma City in 2011 ProRodeo.com. February 3, 2011. Following the completion of the 2013 rodeo, Dallas, Texas and Kissimmee, Florida made bids to become the host city starting in 2015. However, on January 24, 2014 the PRCA signed a contract extension through 2024 with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Nevada's state mandated health restrictions, the 2020 National Finals Rodeo will be held at the Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, where the state's health restrictions were less onerous.  Impact on UNLV  The Thomas & Mack Center is the home court for the UNLV basketball team. By hosting the NFR, the basketball team plays a few of their away games for about 12 days every December while the NFR is in the Thomas & Mack Center.  Television  The National Finals Rodeo was previously broadcast by ESPN, although its coverage was often tape delayed due to coverage of other events. From 2011 to 2013, the NFR was broadcast live on Great American Country (GAC). From 2014 to 2019, it was televised on CBS Sports Network. In 2020, it moved to The Cowboy Channel.

The game received positive reviews to the point a version of this game was developed for the Nintendo DS by Firehazard Studio. It was released on May 28, 2010 in Europe, in North America on June 14, and in Australia on August 26.http://www.jowood.at/?lang=en&site;=10http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/960397-legend- of-kay/data There were also PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game released digitally in North America. Plot For many generations, the mystical land of Yenching had been inhabited by many animals, mainly cats, hares, frogs, and pandas. Because of a religious code called the Way, these four races had prospered throughout the ages in their own separate towns. But as the years passed, the younger generations began to defect from the Way. Ultimately, with no protective code to guide the races, Yenching was invaded by the Gorillas and the Rats (known as the Din), led by Gorilla Minister Shun and Tak, the Rat Alchemist. Minister Shun now rules the majority of Yenching with an iron fist, and is said to reside in the volcanic mountain of Waa-Lo. The story now focuses around a figure named Kay. Kay is a hotheaded young cat, and the Master's finest martial arts student. Like many of the people of the races, Kay does not believe in the Way, and likes to focus on physical skills and strength. This is what makes his friend, Su Ling, leave his town in disgust, hoping to find another town that would share her belief in resurrecting the Way. One day, in Kay's martial arts school, Shun's gorillas and the mayor of Kay's town declare that they must shut down the school because new 'Din schools' must soon be erected in the town. Kay is outraged, and even more so when his Master simply agrees to the new terms. And so, making up his mind, Kay sneaks into his Master's house at night (the Master is drunk, and asleep) and steals the mystical blade the Master keeps. Kay then jumps out of the town walls, and makes his way into the wilderness. Kay's exploits vary from traversing to the Haretree (the secret residence of all the hares of Yenching), befriending a dragon (and almost getting fried in the process), traveling through dangerous swamps in order to reach Frog City (the city of frogs, obviously), and riding on a dragon to get to the Forbidden City (the city of pandas, located on a plateau), all the while defeating hordes of rats, crocodiles, turtles, bears, ladybugs, and gorillas. There, in the Forbidden City, Kay finds his friend Su Ling, who is now a ringleader of the Avalanche, a group of pandas who are dedicated to the revival of the Way, and stopping Shun and the army of Din. After helping them out, the Avalanche begins its voyage to island of Waa-Lo, with Kay in tow. After an arduous voyage, Kay and the Avalanche begin to explore the caves of Waa-Lo, making their way to the center of the volcano. During the expedition, Kay finally catches up with Tak, the rat alchemist. After defeating him, Kay meets Shun in person. The two engage in a fierce duel, with Kay being the victor. Injured, Shun runs to the contraption he and Tak created. The fires of Waa-Lo power up the machine, and begin to fuse Shun and one of his bodyguards into a single, monstrous ape-like entity. With no choice left but to fight, Kay begins to do battle with the monster. As Kay strikes the final blow, Waa-Lo begins to erupt. Luckily, the Avalanche sends a rescue team, via a hot-air balloon. As Kay, Su Ling, and the Avalanche (all back in the ship) stare across the horizon at the exploding volcano, the merchant (who the pandas have seemingly saved) tries to sell some souvenirs to Kay and Su Ling. With a grin, Kay pulls off the merchant's rice hat to reveal the Master himself. Kay jokes about finally having to master his abilities by outfoxing his master. Kay, Su Ling, and the Master all then begin to laugh, the ship returning for a free Yenching.  Remaster  Legend of Kay Anniversary, a version of the game with improved graphics and online leaderboards for players to compare scores, was released on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, and Wii U on July 28, 2015. It was later ported to the Nintendo Switch on May 29, 2018. Reception The PlayStation 2 version of Legend of Kay received an aggregate score of 72/100 on Metacritic. However, the DS version received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews on GameRankings. The remaster, Legend of Kay Anniversary, received an aggregate score of 54/100 on Metacritic. Dom Reseigh-Lincoln of Nintendo Life called the Switch version of the game an \\"unremarkable experience\\", and said that while it was graphically the best version of the game, camera issues were not fixed from the original, and the game had \\"abysmal\\" voice acting, with dated gameplay compared to competitors on the same platform such as Super Mario Odyssey.

These may loosely imitate leather straps,Dundee School of Town & Regional Planning, The Conservation Glossary parchment or metal cut into elaborate shapes, with piercings, and often interwoven in a geometric pattern. In early examples there may or may not be three- dimensionality, either actual in curling relief ends of the elements, or just represented in two dimensions. As the style continued, these curling elements became more prominent, often turning into scrollwork, where the ends curl into spirals or scrolls. By the Baroque scrollwork was a common element in ornament, often partly submerged by other rich ornament. European strapwork is a frequent background and framework for grotesque ornament ‚Äì arabesque or candelabra figures filled with fantastical creatures, garlands and other elements ‚Äì which were a frequent decorative motif in 16th-century Northern Mannerism, and revived in the 19th century and which may appear on walls ‚Äì painted, in frescos, carved in wood, or moulded in plaster or stucco ‚Äì or in graphic work.Fuhring, 164 The Europeanized arabesque patterns called moresque are also very often combined with strapwork, especially in tooled and gilded bookbindings. Scrollwork is a variant that tended to replace strapwork almost completely by the Baroque. It is less geometric and more organic, more three dimensional, and with emphasis on the curling ends of the \\"straps\\". The Italian artists at the Palace of Fontainebleau had already moved onto this by the 1530s,Grove but in provincial work in northern Europe flat strapwork panels continued for another century or more. Where there is no suggestion of three dimensions ‚Äì curling ends and the like ‚Äì the decoration may also be called bandwork or \\"interlaced bands\\", the more technically correct term. Peter Fuhring derives this style from Islamic ornament.Fuhring, 163-164; Grove Italy Strapwork designs, influenced by Islamic ornament, are found on tooled book-covers in Italy and Spain by the mid-15th century, and in other media by the early 16th century, for example in the Raphael Loggie in the Vatican.Grove By the time the First School of Fontainebleau had spread their very emphatic version of the style to northern Europe, the Italians had largely abandoned it, although it remained common on fine decorated bookbindings in Italy as elsewhere, often combined with moresque decoration. Flemish Ornament print, 1550s, Hans Vredeman de Vries The forms developed in Antwerp by Cornelis Floris, Cornelis Bos, Hans Vredeman de Vries and others were disseminated by ornament prints from about 1550 and had an enormous influence across northern Europe. Floris \\"developed the massive Fontainebleau strapwork into a yet more nightmarish style of his own\\",Grove but also, with Bos, \\"experimented with an altogether lighter, more elegant variety\\".Grove France Strapwork was found earlier, but really came to prominence after it was used in stucco in the enormous elaborate decorative frames designed by Rosso Fiorentino and his team for the Palace of Fontainebleau in the 1530s. Thereafter, spread by prints, it became part of the vocabulary of Northern Mannerist ornament.Grove England Strapwork became popular in England in the late 16th and 17th centuries as a form of plasterwork decorative moulding used particularly on ceilings, but also sculpted in stone for example around entrance doors, as at Misarden Park (1620), Gloucestershire, or on monumental sculpture, as on the frieze of the monument to Sir John Newton (d.1568), at East Harptree, Gloucestershire, and on that of Sir Gawen Carew (d.1575) in Exeter Cathedral. Wollaton Hall outside Nottingham makes especially extensive, and for some excessive, use of strapwork inside and out. Islamic Islamic girih uses complex patterns and interlace, but the form of the strips is generally simple, does not vary along their length, and no attempt to achieve a stylized impression of other materials is made. The patterns it used influenced European ornament in the Renaissance, through the Moresque style.Grove Girih is an Islamic decorative art form used in architecture and handicrafts (book covers, tapestry, small metal objects) from the 8th century onwards. It consists of geometric lines that form an interlaced strapwork. Girih patterns are used in varied media including tilework, brickwork, stucco, wood (for example in minbar pulpits) and mosaic faience work.

Since then, the popularity of fish tacos has spread throughout California, although they remain uncommon elsewhere. Rubio's standard fish tacos are made from Alaskan pollock, which is battered, fried, and served in a corn tortilla, although optionally offered with a flour tortilla. Grilled mahi-mahi is also available at all locations. The first Rubio's restaurant was opened in 1983 at a former Orange Julius site on Mission Bay Drive in the Pacific Beach area of San Diego. The first restaurant offered French fries, calamari, and fish tacos, among other cuisine. In 2005, a class action lawsuit was brought against the company complaining that the \\"Lobster Burrito\\" offered at the restaurant contained squat lobster (also known as Langostino) rather than clawed lobster from the family Nephropidae. Rubio's subsequently changed the name of their product to the \\"Langostino Lobster Burrito\\" to avoid future confusion. The burrito is currently only occasionally sold, as a \\"limited time offer\\".

Based on the 2001 Formula One season, GP4 essentially serves as a graphical and seasonal update of Grand Prix 3 which had been released in 2000. The game retained the series' legendary physics engine. However it entered the market at a far less hospitable time than its three predecessors, and the game faced stiff competition from an alternative Formula One simulation from studios such as ISI.  Modifications from version 3  Grand Prix 4 featured a heavily revised graphics engine and updated physics including wet weather driving that even today is considered some of the best to ever feature in a motorsport simulation. Despite this, the game still showed Crammond's oft-commented dated approach to game design. * While it is possible to play the game on a LAN, multiplayer internet gameplay was not possible, due to licensing restrictions. Some individuals managed to circumvent this limitation later using the Free Tunngle Network. * The locked framerate and CPU-heavy graphics were still a big issue with the series despite a completely revised graphics engine. However, the graphics engine proved to be very scalable, supporting models and textures multiple times the detail of the original shipped materials. * The mod community faced similar frustrations with the track format and it took fully two years before the track format was truly \\"cracked\\". The first add-on tracks to be released for the game included Shanghai, Istanbul and Jerez. * When the game was initially launched, it had a large number of bugs. Many of these were addressed by a patch which was later included with the retail game, though the project was canned when Microprose closed and no further official fixes were forthcoming. To compensate for this some third party programmers addressed some of the remaining problems, and included enhancements which allowed the game to follow the updated rules of the Formula One championship. * Many claimed that the stated \\"minimum requirements\\" were set too low and that they could barely get the game to run on a significantly more powerful system. Although the game could be considered a relatively modest commercial success the chances of a further entry to the series could be considered slim to none because MicroProse's parent company Infogrames dissolved the developer shortly after the game's release. Also, the Sony Computer Entertainment brand's exclusive licensing deal for Formula One games rules out an update with official stats. An Xbox port of the title had been planned for release in late 2002 before being cancelled in October of that year.

It came into force on 1 January 1983, but the actual treaty was not signed until 28 March 1983 by the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and Minister for Trade, Lionel Bowen and the New Zealand High Commissioner to Australia, Laurie Francis in Canberra, Australia.  Overview  Prime Ministers Robert Muldoon (New Zealand) and Malcolm Fraser (Australia). CER built on the earlier New Zealand Australia Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was signed on 31 August 1965 and came into force on 1 January 1966. NAFTA had removed four-fifths of the tariffs between the two countries and quantitative restrictions on trade across the Tasman Sea. However, it came to be seen as too complex and bureaucratic, and in March 1980, a joint Prime Ministerial communiqu√© was released that called for \\"closer economic relations\\". The two major sticking points in the negotiations were New Zealand's wish for better access for its dairy products in Australia and Australia's wish for New Zealand to remove export incentives and quantitative restrictions. After the two hurdles were overcome, the Heads of Agreement was signed on 14 December 1982 and came into force on 1 January of the following year. One of the most important results of CER was the Protocol on the Acceleration of Free Trade in Goods, which resulted in the total elimination of tariffs or quantitative restrictions between the two countries by 1 July 1990, five years ahead of schedule. Other parts of CER include: *A good that can be legally sold in one country can also be legally sold in the other. Anyone registered to practise an occupation in one country may practise in the other (with some exemptions including medical practitioners) *Service providers may provide services in either country (except in certain areas such as airway services) The CER is complementary to the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement. Future prospects A$ millions) since 1988 A$ millions) since 1988 Continuing down the path of economic integration, the next step for the Australian and New Zealand governments is to create a customs union through a common external tariff and a common competition policy. New Zealand and Australia already have a common competition policy but are unlikely to have a common external tariff. Addressing the New Zealand Parliament in February 2011, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said: There has been a call from within both the Australian and the New Zealand business communities to extend the CER to other Pacific Island nations, harmonising the CER and the Pacific Regional Trade Agreement (PARTA) so as to move toward a single market and allowing the free movement of people and goods. There have also been calls from organisations such as CANZUK International to extend the CER and the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement to the United Kingdom and Canada, allowing free trade and free movement of people across four of the largest Commonwealth realms.
