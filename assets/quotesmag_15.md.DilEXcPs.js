Her paintings are included in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Life Parara was born around 1944 or 1945. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Parara' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. Parara and her siblings Yakari Napaltjarri, Joseph Jurra Tjapaltjarri and Payu Napaltjarri were the children of Anmanari Nangala and Kirindji Kuku Tjungurrayi. Parara and Payu were co-wives of Freddy West Tjakamarra, who was also married at one stage to artist Takariya Napaltjarri. Parara moved to Papunya with Freddy West in 1963, and died in 2003. Art=Background Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. Career Parara commenced painting for the famous Papunya Tula artists cooperative in June 1996, with her sister Payu commencing painting for them at the same time. Work by Parara is held by the Art Gallery of New Wales, including 1996 painting Women's Business at Marapinti portraying women's ceremonies at the rockhole site of Marapinti, west of Kiwirrkurra Community, Western Australia.

She was the unsuccessful Conservative Party candidate for Westminster North in the 2010 general election.  Early life and education  Cash was born in Northern Ireland. Her mother was a newsagent, while her father held various jobs, sometimes up to three at once. She has a brother who is an NHS doctor, and a sister who is a teacher. Cash was educated at Tandragee Primary and Banbridge AcademyHow the candidates from NI fared across the water BBC News, 9 May 2010 (both state schools). She read English Literature at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University. Cash was elected Librarian of the Oxford Union, but failed in her bid for its presidency.  Legal career  Cash qualified as a barrister after graduating. She was called to the Bar in 1994 as a member of Gray's Inn, and became a tenant at Farrars' Building. In 2000, she joined One Brick Court to specialise in libel, privacy and freedom of expression work. In 2005, Cash successfully represented an innocent man dubbed ‚Äúthe lotto rapist‚Äù in error by the Sunday Mirror winning her client considerable damages. Cash has spoken out strongly for strengthening freedom of the press, arguing that the Reynolds defence should be strengthened and that the Sullivan defence (derived from the 1964 US case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, allowing the press to write about public figures) should be introduced to the UK. Cash hosted a debate for Policy Exchange on libel reform, believing that libel tourism ought to be curbed. Cash has represented a number of clients, including Elle Macpherson and Trudie Styler. She was called a ‚Äúfreedom fighter‚Äù in an Observer article in 2009. For her legal work, the British edition of Vogue includes Cash as one of the 50 women of the age, alongside the likes of Michelle Obama and the Queen.  Conservative candidacy  As a member of the Society of Conservative Lawyers, Cash assisted the Shadow Cabinet on legal issues. She also worked with Policy Exchange the centre-right think tank to formulate policy proposals and to provide input on media issues, and enlisted governmental support from then Shadow Justice Secretary Dominic Grieve for libel reform. She is a key Tory activist for libel reform and free speech. In February 2006, she applied to become a Conservative candidate and was placed on the A-list. She was selected to fight her local seat, Westminster North, the first and only seat she had applied for, in November 2006, four months before she met her husband Octavius. In September 2008, Tatler featured Cash as one of ten top up-and-coming Tories, tipping her as a future Housing Minister. Cash spoke to the magazine about welfare reform, arguing that teenagers need more welfare support for staying in education, not for getting pregnant. Cash was described by The Times in February 2009 as ‚Äúone to watch‚Äù. In September 2009, she was profiled in a list of ‚Äúrising stars‚Äù of the Conservative party for The Daily Telegraph, who described her as a \\"Eurosceptic with a sharp mind\\". An article in The Sunday Telegraph in October 2009 reported \\"Some high-profile women are already installed in winnable seats: Louise Bagshawe, Annunziata Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel, Laura Sandys and Joanne Cash will all make colourful additions to the Tory benches.\\"Melissa Kite \\"The softly, softly fight for the women's vote at the general election\\" The Telegraph, 25 October 2009 In February 2010, Cash disagreed with members of her constituency association over strategies to win the seat, with the result that David Cameron, the leader of the party but not yet prime minister, intervened to sack Amanda Sayers, chair of the Westminster North Conservative Association. Cash then commented on her Twitter page that her opponents were ‚Äúdinosaurs‚Äù. Shortly afterwards Cash tendered her resignation as candidate, but the Conservatives did not accept it, and she continued to campaign for Westminster North until the election in May. Cash failed to gain the new seat from the incumbent Labour member for Regent's Park and Kensington North, Karen Buck. When she failed to secure the seat, she accused the media of lying about her and her husband.  Mind Gym  Fighting an inner London marginal seat inspired Cash to co-found Parent Gym, the philanthropic programme of Mind Gym, which runs workshops aimed at increasing parents' skills and confidence, and therefore improving the wellbeing of their children. On the back of the success of Parent Gym, Cash became a board director of Mind Gym in 2012 before becoming chair of the board in 2014.  Personal life  In December 2007, Cash married Octavius Black, the founder and managing director of The Mind Gym. Friends who attended their exchange of vows \\"included Ed Vaizey and Michael Gove, Viscount and Viscountess Rothermere, Stuart Rose and Kirstie Allsopp\\". Black was educated at Eton College at the same time as David Cameron; the two men have stayed close, and they and their wives socialise together. The couple are reported to live in Notting Hill.

Further, Du was said to be 79 years old at the time of his death. As Qin was executed in 873, it would appear that Du died in 873 as well, but that is not completely clear.New Book of Tang, vol. 166.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252.), courtesy name Yongyu (), formally the Duke of Bin (), was an official of the Tang dynasty of China, serving two terms as chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Wuzong and Emperor Wuzong's cousin Emperor Yizong. He was traditionally considered a skilled politician who maintained his high position throughout his lengthy career, but not a capable chancellor.  Background and early career  Du Cong came from a prominent aristocratic family, with his grandfather Du You having served as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Dezong, Emperor Dezong's son Emperor Shunzong, and Emperor Shunzong's son Emperor Xianzong. Du Cong's father Du Shifang () was Du You's second son, and served several terms as minister or regional governor. The famed poet Du Mu was his cousin (son of Du Shifang's brother Du Congyu ().Old Book of Tang, vol. 147. Because Du Cong's heritage, he entered civil service early, and as his third assignment he served as a staff member of the Crown Prince.However, while it appeared that this was during Emperor Xianzong's reign, it is not completely clear which crown prince he served under, as Emperor Xianzong had two ‚Äî Li Ning and Li Heng (the eventual Emperor Muzong). When the imperial scholar Dugu Yu () offered to resign on account of the fact that his father-in-law Quan Deyu had just been made chancellor, Emperor Xianzong, who was impressed with Dugu's talent, stated, \\"How is it that Quan Deyu gets a son-in-law like Dugu Yu and I do not?\\" Therefore, for his own daughters, he turned away from the tradition of selecting their husbands from the households of the nobles and the accomplished generals, instead requesting the officials in charge to select their husbands from scholarly officials whose sons had literary talents. Most of the candidates declined, but Du Cong did not. In 814, Emperor Xianzong therefore had him marry Emperor Xianzong's daughter Princess Qiyang, the oldest daughter of Emperor Xianzong's wife Consort Guo. It was said that Princess Qiyang was humble, unlike many princesses of the day, and, to avoid a situation where her servants would look down on the Du household, she declined to take them with her.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. Little was known about Du's career the rest of Emperor Xianzong's reign, or the reigns of his son Emperor Muzong and Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Jingzong, other than that he eventually became minister of agriculture (Âè∏Ëæ≤Âçø, Sinong Qing).  During Emperor Wenzong's reign  In 832, during the reign of Emperor Jingzong's younger brother Emperor Wenzong, Du Cong was made the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the region of the Tang capital Chang'an). At that time, he was considered a close associate of the chancellor Li Zongmin,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. a leader of the faction later known as the Niu Faction (named after Li Zongmin's ally Niu Sengru) in the Niu-Li Factional Struggles.See, e.g., Bo Yang, The Outlines of the History of the Chinese (‰∏≠Âúã‰∫∫Âè≤Á∂±), vol. 2, p. 568. He tried to broker a peace between Li Zongmin and Li Deyu, a leader of the rival Li Faction (after whom the Li Faction was named), by suggesting that Li Zongmin offer to recommend Li Deyu to oversee the imperial examinations. Li Zongmin rejected the idea, but agreed to Du's alternate proposal of recommending Li Deyu as chief imperial censor; Li Deyu was pleased, but when Li Zongmin subsequently reneged, the possibility of peace between Li Zongmin and Li Deyu was broken. In 833, Du was sent out of Chang'an to serve as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), as well as the mayor of its capital Fengxiang Municipality. Thereafter, he briefly left government service to observe a mourning period when his mother died. In 834, he was recalled to government service as the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in Xuchang, Henan). In 835, there was a time when Emperor Wenzong was set to replace him with the general Li Ting (), but Li Ting's commission was cancelled when Emperor Wenzong's close associate Zheng Zhu falsely accused Li Ting of corruption, and Du thus remained at Zhongwu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245. Around the new year 838,Old Book of Tang, vol. 17, part 2. Du was recalled to Chang'an to serve as the minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu) and acting director of finances. At that time, Princess Qiyang died; as a result of observing a mourning period for her ‚Äî as it was customary for princesses' husbands to observe a three-year mourning period for them, although that was not required of ordinary widowers ‚Äî he did not meet Emperor Wenzong to thank him for the commission, which surprised Emperor Wenzong. The chancellor Li Jue explained the reason why Du was not meeting him and commented, \\"This is half of the reason why prominent clans' members do not want to engage in marriages with the imperial household.\\" Emperor Wenzong commented that he did not know of this custom, and subsequently issued an edict abolishing it. In 838, Du was made minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Hubu Shanshu) and continued to act as the director of finances.  During Emperor Wuzong's reign  Emperor Wenzong died in 840 and was succeeded by his younger brother Emperor Wuzong, supported by the powerful eunuchs Qiu Shiliang and Yu Hongzhi (), against the wishes of the chancellors Li Jue and Yang Sifu. Therefore, after Emperor Wuzong took the throne, he had Yang and Li Jue removed from their chancellor positions and sent out of the capital. In 841, after further accusations by Qiu against Yang, Li Jue, as well as two eunuchs that Emperor Wenzong had favored, Liu Hongyi () and Xue Jileng (), Emperor Wuzong ordered Liu and Xue to commit suicide, and sent messengers to Tang Prefecture (ÊΩ≠Â∑û, in modern Changsha, Hunan), where Yang was serving as the governor of Hunan Circuit (), and Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, in modern Guilin, Guangxi), where Li Jue was serving as the governor of Gui District (), to order Yang and Li Jue to commit suicide as well. When Du Cong heard of this, he met Li Deyu (who had become the lead chancellor by this point) and warned Li Deyu that Emperor Wuzong, being still a young emperor, should not become accustomed to kill high-level officials. Li Deyu and his fellow chancellors Cui Gong, Cui Dan, and Chen Yixing thus interceded on Yang's and Li Jue's behalf. Emperor Wuzong relented and spared Yang's and Li Jue's lives, although they were further demoted.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246. As of 844, Du was serving as the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), when Emperor Wuzong issued an order to the eunuch monitor of Huainan Circuit that he should select 17 prostitutes who were capable in drinking games and send them to the palace. The eunuch monitor asked Du to be involved in the selection process, and further contemplated training regular women to learn the drinking games and then submitting them. Du refused to be involved. In anger, the eunuch monitor submitted an accusation against Du. When Emperor Wuzong received the report, however, he reconsidered and came to believe that his original order was inappropriate, and cancelled it. Later in the year, he recalled Du to serve as chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), and also to serve as the director of finances and the director of the salt and iron monopolies. When Du met with him to thank him, he praised Du and compared Du to the early Tang chancellor Wei Zheng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 247. Later in the year, after the imperial campaign against the warlord Liu Zhen resulted in Liu's officer Guo Yi () killing Liu and surrendering Liu's Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) to the imperial government, Li Deyu argued that Guo was treacherous and should be put to death as well. Emperor Wuzong agreed with Li Deyu. Du, pointing out that at that time the imperial treasury was exhausted, argued for Guo to be tolerated, thus drawing Emperor Wuzong's displeasure. In 845, he was thus removed from his chancellor post.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248. He was soon sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), and later was transferred to Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan).  During Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign  As of 849, by which time Emperor Wuzong had died and been succeeded by his uncle Emperor XuƒÅnzong, Du Cong was at Xichuan. That year, with Tang's rival to the west Tufan in internal turmoil and various Tang circuit armies set out to recover territory that Tang had previously lost to Tufan, Du's Xichuan Circuit recovered Wei Prefecture (Á∂≠Â∑û, in modern Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan). Later, Du was transferred back to Huainan Circuit. In 855, Huainan was suffering from a severe famine, but it was said that Du was spending his time in feasting and gaming, not managing the famine relief. When Emperor XuƒÅnzong received report of this, he sent the chancellor Cui Xuan to Huainan to serve as its military governor, and made Du a senior advisor to the Crown Prince, but with his office at the eastern capital Luoyang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249.However, as there was no crown prince at that time, the post was entirely honorary. A year or so later, he was made the defender of Luoyang. Sometime after, he was returned to Xichuan to serve as its military governor.  During Emperor Yizong's reign  As of 861, by which time Emperor XuƒÅnzong had died and been succeeded by his son Emperor Yizong, Du Cong was back at Chang'an and serving as Zuo Pushe (Â∑¶ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ, one of the heads of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng)) and the director of finances, when he was made Menxia Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and chancellor again with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi. It was said that there was a time when Emperor Yizong issued a secret order to him through the eunuch Yang Gongqing () that the other chancellors at the time, Bi Xian, Du Shenquan, and Jiang Shen should be punished for having failed to suggest Emperor Yizong's succession late in Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign. Du argued against it, pointing out to Yang and the other eunuchs that getting the emperor accustomed to killing would also hurt them in the future. As a result, nothing was eventually done against Bi, Du Shenquan, or Jiang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250.However, the Song Dynasty/Yuan Dynasty historian Hu Sanxing, the commentator to the Zizhi Tongjian, pointed out that this account was implausible given that Emperor Yizong had himself commissioned Bi and Du Shenquan as chancellors, and believed that this was an account forged by Du Cong's family members. See Hu's commentary, quoted in the Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 60 [861]. While serving as chancellor, he was also given the honorific title of Taifu () and created the Duke of Bin. At that time, Tang was engaged in a war with Nanzhao over Tang's refusal to bestow imperial sanction on the succession of Nanzhao's new king Qiulong () over Qiulong's name being violative of the naming taboo for Emperor Xuanzong (who was named Li Longji). Du suggested that new Tang emissaries be sent to Nanzhao to mourn the death of Qiulong's father Fengyou () and inform Qiulong that as soon as he changed his name, Tang would sanction his succession. Emperor Yizong agreed, but before the emissaries could be sent, Nanzhao launched an attack on Xi Prefecture (Â∑ÇÂ∑û, in modern Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan) and Qionglai Pass (ÈÇõÂ¥çÈóú, in modern Ya'an, Sichuan), and so the mission was cancelled. In 863, Du was sent out of Chang'an to serve as the military governor of Fengxiang, continuing to carry the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title. He was eventually transferred to Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). In 873, when Nanzhao attacked both Xichuan and Qianzhong Circuits (Èªî‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Chongqing), the defender of Qianzhong, Qin Kuangmou () had too weak of an army to defend against the Nanzhao attack, and he abandoned it and fled to Jingnan. Du arrested Qin and submitted an accusation against Qin. Emperor Yizong, in response, issued an edict ordering that Qin be executed and that his assets and family be forfeited.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252. This was not a response that Du expected, and, in shock, he suffered an illness and died. He was given posthumous honors. The traditional accounts of Du's career indicated that he was not talented‚Äîthat while he served as general and chancellor, he only cared about protecting himself and did not advance the careers of talented people.

The Mission Statement of the school is \\"to provide young children with the holistic concept of knowledge with the holy Quran and the Sunnah as the source of guidance\\". The core ideology adopted is \\"Every child in Jannah\\". JMS is run by the Johannesburg Muslim School Association (Incorporated under Section 21 of the Companies Act, 1973, South Africa). The members of the association administer the school on a voluntary basis. Being a Section 21 company, the association is incorporated as total profit. All funding received as fees from learners is used entire for the objectives of the school, including the payment of salaries to educators as well as to fill the pocket. Johannesburg Muslim School is ranked in the Top 100 schools in the Gauteng province as is rated in the top 5 feeder schools from previously disadvantaged communities by the University of the Witwatersrand.  History  Plans for a Muslim school in the Johannesburg area were conceived during 1989.Introducing the Johannesburg Muslim School, 19 January 2010 handout, Johannesburg Muslim School. The Johannesburg Muslim School had its humble beginnings in January 1990. From its premises on 10th Avenue, Mayfair, Johannesburg, the Johannesburg Muslim School (JMS) began with 115 learners. Tuition was first offered from Class 1 to Standard 2 (Grades 1 to 4). The Board of Management had resolved that the establishment of the school will take place in several stages. In 1991, tuition was extended to standard 3 (Grade 5) level and a pre- school with nursery classes was also introduced. The student enrolment increased to 189 in 1991. Tuition was subsequently offered at higher levels over the years that followed. As of 1997, the school offers classes from Nursery up to Matric (Grade 12) and the student enrollment in 2010 was 1200 students. The school outgrew its premises on 10th Avenue, Mayfair, and in 1992 moved to the old Bree Street School complex in Fordsburg. This complex was completely revamped to provide students with better facilities. Again, as a result of natural growth, the premises at the Bree Street School complex became inadequate. JMS then leased the old Johannesburg Secondary School premises in Fordsburg from the Department of Public Works. A new school complex is planned in nearby Crosby, Johannesburg.

Louisa commenced painting at Lajamanu, Northern Territory in 1986. Her work is held by the National Gallery of Victoria. Life Louisa Lawson Napaljarri was born circa 1926 or 1931. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Louisa Lawson' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. As a child, Louisa lived around Ngarrupalya, west of Yuendumu and over three hundred kilometres north-west of Alice Springs. Her first contact with white Australians was at Alice Springs. She worked as a cook at Granites, a Northern Territory goldmine, and her daughter by one of the miners, Robyn Napurrula Green, is also an artist. Louisa herself was the sister of prominent Yuendumu artist Paddy Japaljarri Sims. Louisa was a \\"senior woman in the ceremonial life of the Lajamanu community\\". She died in 2001. Art=Background Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale. Career Louisa Lawson was one of a number of artists who first learned painting through a course run in 1986 at Lajamanu, Northern Territory by an adult education officer, John Quinn, associated with the local Technical and Further Education unit. The course, initially attended only by men, eventually enrolled over a hundred community members. Others who began their careers through that course include Mona Napaljarri and Peggy Rockman Napaljarri. In the 1990s she was \\"one of the best known painters at Lajamanu\\". Works by Louisa are held by the National Gallery of Victoria, which included her works in its 1989 Mythscapes and 1991 Paint Up Big exhibitions.

Its caterpillar is a crop pest and is known as the croci or the cabbage cluster caterpillar. This moth is found in Africa and Asia, its range extending from South Africa through India to the Pacific Ocean, including Australia. The wingspan is about . The larvae feed on Brassicaceae species and are considered an agricultural pest on cabbages. At first, they feed only on the undersides of the leaves. Later they feed on the rest of the leaves and the central shoot. The species was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1794. Description Life cycle The adult male is between long with a wingspan of , and the female is slightly smaller. Both are rather variable in colouring but have brownish markings on a cream background. The male can be distinguished by the tufts of dark-coloured hairs at the front of the forewings. The eggs are pale green and up to three hundred are laid in an overlapping pile that may be in diameter. The larvae are grey with dark heads when they hatch and later become green with dark heads and five fine pale yellow longitudinal stripes. The pupa is cylindrical, olive green to light brown, becoming darker shortly before emergence. It is surrounded by a silken cocoon. Distribution and host plants Crocidolomia pavonana is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of Africa, Asia and Australia. Its range extends from South Africa and Madagascar through India, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines to northern Australia. Host plants eaten by the larvae include the brassicaceous plants Brassica oleracea and Brassica rapa and their varieties, but also cotton (Gossypium), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), Gynandropsis, nasturtium (Tropaeolum) and radish (Raphanus). Damage The eggs take about four days to hatch. The young larvae feed on the underside of the leaf on which they hatch before moving on to other parts of the plant. They pass through five instars over a period of about twelve days, burrowing into the centre of the plant after about four days. If the apical meristem is damaged, multiple heads may be produced or the plant may die. The larvae from a single egg cluster can destroy a whole cabbage or cauliflower plant. Ecology In tests in Uganda it was determined that when offered six brassicaceous crops, white cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Chinese cabbage and Indian mustard, the insect preferred to lay its eggs on Chinese cabbage and broccoli. Offered the choice of Chinese cabbage and white cabbage, the reduction of egg laying on the white cabbage ranged from 69 to 100%. Several parasitoids are known to attack the larvae of this moth in different parts of its range. These include braconid wasps and tachinid flies, and in India the larvae are preyed on by a predatory bug in the family Pentatomidae.

Biography  Eutychian was the son of the Consul of 361, Taurus; it is known that he had a wife. He should be identified with the character of Typhon in the allegorical work Aegyptus sive de providentia, by Synesius, where he represents the pro-Gothic party; Synesius said that he had a wild and reckless youth.Synesius, De providentia, 90C-91C. He converted to Arianism, the form of Christianity professed by the Goths.

A native of New York, he lived in Illinois and Missouri before he was captain of the first wagon train over the Oregon Trail to what became the state of Oregon. He also organized several schools and churches, and served as a judge and justice of the peace. In Oregon, he settled on the Tualatin Plains near what is now Hillsboro and later lived in Eastern Oregon. Early life David Lenox was born in Catskill, New York, on December 8, 1802.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 146. His parents were English of the Scotch Methodist faith. He became an orphan at an early age, and had a limited education in the local schools. At 18 he left New York for Lexington, Kentucky, where he worked on a plantation. There he married the plantation owner‚Äôs daughter, Louisa Swan, in 1826. The couple had ten children. The Lenox family moved to a farm at Rushville, Illinois, in 1829. There David Lenox farmed and served as a school teacher. He also converted to the Baptist sect in Rushville in 1832. In 1840, Lenox sold the farm and moved to Todds Creek in Platte County, where he bought timberland for $5 per acre. In Missouri he served as the clerk at his local church. After a couple years they decided their land would not be productive enough to sustain the family, and they resolved to immigrate to the Oregon Country. Oregon Trail About 1843 Lenox was working as a contractor in Missouri (now Kansas) near Fort Leavenworth when he heard a speech about Oregon from Peter Hardeman Burnett. Lenox was already waiting to start for the Willamette Valley, but after the speech he signed up to travel with Burnett to Oregon. They formed a wagon train for the journey and hired a Mr. Gantt to lead the group to Fort Hall. On April 9, the party departed Platte City, Missouri on what was the first wagon train to cross the Oregon Trail all the way to Oregon. Burnett was selected as the captain of the wagon train at the beginning, but after one day he resigned and Lenox was elected as the new captain. After complaints that those traveling with livestock would slow down the entire group, the wagon train was split into two groups. The light column without the cattle was led by Lenox, and the cow column was captained by Jesse Applegate. Despite Gannt being hired as the pilot, the Rev. Marcus Whitman arrived on May 15 at Westport, Missouri. Whitman arrived after his winter trip from his mission in the Oregon Country to Washington, D.C., and joined the group after they had started out. He was then hired to guide them all the way to the Columbia River, which was in addition to Gannt‚Äôs guide services. Asa Lovejoy also joined the group after he had returned east from Oregon with Whitman. During the trip Lenox and Whitman insisted the wagon train not proceed on Sundays due to their religious beliefs. On August 29, Whitman left the group after Fort Hall to return to his mission after word had reached him of trouble with the natives, but promised to send back a Cayuse chief to guide them across the Blue Mountains and on to the Columbia. Whitman arrived at the Snake River and waited for the wagon train to catch up after surmising the crossing was more difficult than anticipated. After the crossing Whitman again left, and a Native American guide sent by Whitman arrived when the wagon train was at the Grande Ronde Mountains, and led them to the Whitman Mission. After one day at the mission, the group headed for the Columbia River without Whitman. At The Dalles the wagon train took rafts down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver opposite the mouth of the Willamette River. Lenox arrived in Oregon City on the Willamette on November 26. Oregon The West Union Baptist Church Lenox founded Plaque dedicated to Lenox at his gravesite He settled first in 1844 on a land claim that he purchased near what is now Hillsboro, Oregon, in the community of West Union on the east Tualatin Plains, with that farm later known as the Joe Mecke farm. After a brief residence, he settled a donation land claim nearby and farmed the land. Lenox brought the first corn to the Willamette Valley. On May 25, 1844, he organized the West Union Baptist Church in his home, the first Baptist congregation west of the Rocky Mountains. Lenox donated the land for both the church and adjoining cemetery. The church is located where his original cabin was located. Lenox was selected as deacon of the congregation. Two of his daughters became the first Baptists baptized in Oregon when baptized in 1845. In 1845, the Rev. Ezra Fisher and his family arrived at the Lenox home and spent the winter with the Lenoxes. That winter the cabin held the thirteen members of the Lenox clan, six members of the Fisher family, and a widow and her three children. The cabin measured 18 feet by 22 feet, and Lenox left the cabin in the spring for a new cabin, with the Fisher family remaining on the old cabin. In 1847, Lenox helped to establish the Baptist Church in Oregon City. He helped establish the first Baptist Association on the west coast in 1848, and served as the clerk of that body. After farming at first, Lenox later ran a mercantile. On November 12, 1851, he helped found the West Union School District, the first in the county.Buan, Carolyn M. This Far- Off Sunset Land: A Pictorial History of Washington County, Oregon. Donning Company Publishers, 1999. pp. 46 and 69. He served on the first board of directors of the district along with Caleb Wilkins and James W. Chambers. Along with George W. Ebbert and Ralph Wilcox and several others, he was one of the first people to buy a lot in 1852 in what became the city of Hillsboro. In 1857, he and several others formed the West Union Institute to serve as a Baptist school. The school never held classes, and instead was transferred to a school in McMinnville run by Sebastian C. Adams and became the forerunner of Linfield College. Political career In the June 3, 1845, elections for the provisional government, Lenox was a candidate to represent Tuality District in the legislature. He finished sixth in the voting, with David Hill, Morton M. McCarver, and J. W. Smith elected to the House of Representatives instead of Lenox. From 1847 to 1848 he was a justice of the peace in that district, and was a candidate to be a probate judge there in 1850. A Democrat, he served in that position, the only judge in what had become Washington County.Provisional and Territorial Records. Washington County Probate Court Records. Film 24, reel 15, page 6. February 4, 1850. Later life Lenox moved to the Eastern Oregon city of Weston in 1870 where he purchased a farm. David Thomas Lenox died on October 18, 1874, near Weston at the age of 71. After his death he was buried on the farm, with the location of the gravesite at the Kees (or Blue Mountain) Cemetery later lost, but then rediscovered in 1924.

He played football for Corinthian F.C., and was selected to play for Wales four times between 1887 and 1890. As a cricketer, he made over 50 first-class appearances, all for Somerset County Cricket Club. His availability in both sports was limited by his career in education; he was headmaster at a number of schools across southern England. Challen was considered one of Somerset's principle amateur batsmen during the late 1880s and early 1890s, when he frequently finished near the top of their batting averages. His style was more defensive than many of his fellow amateurs, and he was often praised for playing vital innings to keep Somerset's batting together. He scored the only first-class century of his career in 1893 against Sussex, but began to appear less often after 1894, finally bowing out of county cricket after the 1899 season. In all, he scored 1,656 first-class runs at an average of 19.71 Life and education career John Bonamy Challen was born in Ruthin, Denbighshire, Wales, on 26 March 1863. He was the son of a school master based at Ruthin Grammar School, though the family home was in Nunney, near Frome in east Somerset. He was educated at Honiton Grammar School, Philberds School and then Marlborough College. At Marlborough, he played for the school's cricket team in 1879, and played at Lord's in their annual fixture against Rugby School, in which he scored 15 and 4 runs, and took one wicket, though Marlborough lost the match by 97 runs. After completing his studies at Marlborough, Challen taught at Thornton Heath in Surrey from 1880 until 1882, and then Wellingborough Grammar School until 1892. He was then appointed as headmaster of Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Crediton for three years. On 5 September 1893, he married Amy Price, in Willey, Warwickshire. He later moved to the Devon County School in West Buckland for four years. He then moved back out of the south-west, and was head master at Philberds School from 1905 to 1910, and then Aldro in Eastbourne until 1918, after which he became a partner at the Christopher's school in the same town. Challen died in a nursing home in Eastbourne on 5 June 1937, aged 74. Sporting career=Cricket In 1875, while still a teenager, Challen was among the youngest of those to donate half a guinea to help establish Somerset County Cricket Club. Five years later, in 1880, Challen began playing for Somerset; he appeared for the county in a match against sixteen players from Ashton Court in July, and in three county matches the following month. Though he played primarily as an attacking, free-hitting batsman, and an occasional fast-medium paced bowler, he also kept wicket for Somerset against Leicestershire in 1880, taking a stumping in the first innings. His teaching career meant that his availability for Somerset was limited, and the vast majority of his appearances were made during the summer holidays, typically in August. In 1883, while teaching at Wellingborough, he played a match for Northamptonshire, but the following season he was playing for Somerset again. In June 1884, Challen scored 205 runs for Wellingborough Grammar School against an Oxford team put together by R. T. Hughes. Challen's appearances for Somerset in 1880, and Northamptonshire in 1883, had all been in \\"second-class\\" cricket, as neither team had first-class status at the time. As such, Challen's debut in first-class cricket came in August 1884, when he played for Somerset against Hampshire. Somerset lost the match by a large margin, but after scoring 11 runs in the first innings, Challen made his team's highest score in the second, finishing with 93 runs. Challen, along with Stephen Newton, played a similar role in the next match; Somerset were trailing after both teams had batted their first innings, and after following- on, Challen and Newton resisted the Lancashire bowling. When Challen was dismissed for 42 runs, the Western Daily Press said that \\"it was felt that the chances of Somerset were very poor.\\" They went on to lose by eight wickets. It was as a bowler that Challen was most effective in the following match against second-class Devon. In a spell described in the Exeter and Plymouth Gazette Daily Telegram as \\"destructive\\", Challen took four wickets in the first innings against a weak Devon side, helping Somerset earn victory by an innings. Challen completed the season with two further first-class appearances, return matches against Hampshire and Lancashire, in which he did not score many runs. In his four first-class matches in 1884, he scored 176 runs at an average of 25.14, and took seven wickets at 22.71. He also made six appearances for the East Somerset Cricket Club, where he was one of their top batsmen, scoring 155 runs at an average of just over 30. The next season, Somerset struggled once again; they won just one of their six first-class fixtures. Challen was available for five of the six matches, and though he scored less prolifically than in the previous season, he ranked amongst the county's top batsmen; his 163 runs at 16.3 placed him fifth in the batting averages, and third by total number of runs. Of Challen's runs for Somerset that year, almost half came in one match, against Gloucestershire. In the first innings of that match, in which he scored 39 runs, Challen's batting was described by the Gloucester Citizen as \\"vigorous but rather lucky\\", while he was the final wicket to fall in the second innings, for 40. Somerset were stripped of their first-class status in 1886; they had not played enough cricket the previous year, and when they did their performances had been below that expected of a top-level county side. Challen only played four county matches during the season; appearing three times for Somerset, and once for Northamptonshire. His scores between 1886 and 1889 were generally reasonably low, though he did score 91 runs against the MCC to help Somerset to victory at Lord's in 1888. He topped Somerset's batting averages in 1888, scoring 219 runs at 31.2. As a batsman, Somerset cricket historian Stephen Hill describes Challen as \\"a beautiful timer of the ball capable of taking the fight to the bowlers.\\" However, Hill also notes that he often had to temper his game and play more steadily to accommodate some of the more reckless amateur batsmen in the Somerset team of the time. In 1889, Challen batted in seven innings for the county, averaging 21 runs, though his top-score was a relatively modest 28 not out. The subsequent 1890 season was a successful one for Somerset; they were unbeaten in their thirteen county matches, winning twelve and tying the other. Challen was fourth in Somerset's batting averages, achieving his highest score of the season, 67, against Leicestershire. Later in the season, he also scored 49 of the 107 runs that Somerset managed during their tied match against Middlesex; his innings was described as \\"far and away the best innings of the side.\\" Somerset's strong performance in 1890 saw them readmitted to first-class cricket in 1891, whereupon they joined the County Championship, a competition which had only been instituted the previous year. Challen, playing in a first-class match for the first time in over five years, only managed six runs against Middlesex in May that season, though Cricket magazine described the wicket as \\"not in favour of the batsmen\\" due to heavy rain. In Somerset's first win of 1891, Challen made modest scores of 41 and 18 not out, but he was praised for his steady play, both in a partnership with Lionel Palairet on the first day, and with his brother Richard Palairet towards the end of the game. Challen was praised later in the season for his resilient batting in difficult conditions against Lancashire's spin bowling duo of Johnny Briggs and Arthur Mold, though he could not prevent his side from losing. He scored his highest total of the season in mid-August against Surrey, playing \\"sound cricket with plenty of hit tempered by excellent defence\\" to score 89 runs in the second innings and help Somerset to victory. In the next match, he took advantage of difficult bowling conditions to score 79 runs against Gloucestershire during another win for Somerset. Challen finished the season top of the Somerset batting averages, and eleventh in the national averages, with 394 runs scored at 26.26. In 1892, Challen played an \\"excellent innings\\" to score 45 runs against a strong Middlesex team, but could not offer any resistance in the second innings as Middlesex won by 112 runs. He played well again to give Somerset victory over Kent, when he scored 48 not out in the second innings, and a string of good results for the county led Cricket magazine to suggest that they \\"must not be overlooked\\" in the county championship race. In early August, Challen made a pair of centuries for the Old Wellingburians, scoring 166 against the Old Bedford Modernians, and 104 against Rolvenden. During a victory over Middlesex, Challen scored his highest total of the season, 72 runs scored in an hour and a half. Challen was fourth in the county batting averages, and 33rd nationally, scoring 835 runs at 22.33. Challen was missing for much of the early part of 1893, but performed well in both matches against Sussex that year. He scored 57 of Somerset's 137 runs in the first innings of their match in Brighton, while he played \\"free and attractive cricket without a mistake\\" to score 108 in two hours at Taunton. That score was both his highest score, and his only century in first-class cricket. He once again finished the season fourth in the county averages, with 311 runs at 25.91. Though Challen was able to play six times for Somerset in 1894, he only managed to score 92 runs at an average of 7.66. His appearances became less frequent over the following years; he played for Somerset just once in 1895, five times in 1896, and then not again until 1899. He did score a half-century on his first match in 1896, but struggled in his later appearances. During two matches against the Nondescripts in 1899, Challen scored centuries in non-first-class matches, scoring 102 for a team he put together, and 100 exactly for North Devon Cricket Club. His final first- class appearance was against Gloucestershire from 28‚Äì30 August 1899, when he scored six runs in the first innings, and was not needed in the second as Somerset won by five wickets. He completed his career with 1,656 first-class runs at an average of 19.71, and sixteen wickets at 35.75. Football Challen made his first appearance for the Wales national football team in February 1887, playing against England in the 1886‚Äì87 British Home Championship. Wales lost the match 4‚Äì0. Challen appeared again the following month against Scotland, in a 2‚Äì0 loss for Wales. In each of these appearances, Challen is listed by The Times as representing Ruthin, but it is unclear if this refers to a football team, or just the place of his birth. He played his third match for Wales in February 1888, when they lost 5‚Äì1 to England, though Challen was praised for his play on the right-wing. His fourth and final international appearance came in March 1890, and was once again in a match against England. Though the Welsh lost 3‚Äì1, Challen was again praised for his play, and had two openings at goal, though he did not manage to score either. Challen played football for Corinthian F.C., an amateur team which \\"[cherry- picked] the best players from leading sides\\". The club had been formed to provide the England national football team with players that were used to playing together, and during the late-1880s and early-1890s, the majority of England players also played for the Corinthians. As the club was strictly amateur, it did not compete in the FA Cup, and players could continue to represent other teams in professional competitions. Challen supplemented his matches for the Corinthians with appearances for Swifts F.C., based in Slough, Berkshire.

ALL-IN-1 was designed and developed by Skip Walter, John Churin and Marty Skinner from Digital Equipment Corporation who began work in 1977.Microsoft Research Digital Computing TimelineComputer History Digital Computing Timeline Sheila Chance was hired as the software engineering manager in 1981. The first version of the software was called CP/OSS, the Charlotte Package of Office System Services, named after the location of the developers. In 1983, the product was renamed ALL-IN-1 and the Charlotte group continued to develop versions 1.1 through 1.3. Digital then made the decision to move most of the development activity to its central engineering facility in Reading, United Kingdom, where a group there took responsibility for the product from version 2.0 (released in field test in 1984 and to customers in 1985) onward. The Charlotte group continued to work on the Time Management subsystem until version 2.3 and other contributions were made from groups based in Sophia Antipolis, France (System for Customization Management and the integration with VAX Notes), Reading (Message Router and MAILbus), and Nashua, New Hampshire (FMS). ALL-IN-1 V3.0 introduced shared file cabinets and the File Cabinet Server (FCS) to lay the foundation for an eventual integration with TeamLinks, Digital's PC office client. Previous integrations with PCs included PC ALL-IN-1, a DOS-based product introduced in 1989 that never proved popular with customers. Bob Wyman was the first product manager. He oversaw the growth of the product culminating in over $2 billion per year in leveraged revenue and market leadership in the proprietary office automation sector.

The Ninjas were formed by the politician Bernard Kol√©las in the early 1990s and were commanded by Fr√©d√©ric Bintsamou, alias Pastor Ntoumi, when Kolelas was in exile. The militia fought the supporters of President Pascal Lissouba in the 1993‚Äì94 Civil War. In the 1997-99 Civil War, they allied with Lissouba's forces against the supporters of former President Denis Sassou Nguesso. After Sassou Nguesso's victory in this Civil War, Ntoumi's Ninjas fought an insurgency against his government in the Pool Department. The conflict in the Pool escalated in a series of violent clashes in 2002-03, after which the Ninja leadership eventually gave up their armed struggle. Ntoumi announced the disbanding of the Ninjas in 2008 but they resurfaced in 2016, starting the Pool War. Character and ideology Frederick Bintsamou who is also known as Pastor Ntoumi. Formed by and originally loyal to Bernard Kol√©las, the Ninja militia was associated with the Bakongo ethnic group. The militia was named after the ninjas of feudal Japan. The Ninja field commander, Pastor Ntoumi, has been described as a cult leader and a \\"messianic pastor\\". In 2003, he told a journalist that the Holy Spirit told him to revive the Ninjas. Ninja militiamen wore the colour purple (symbolizing suffering), and had their hair in dreadlocks. They were reported to believe that the apocalypse was near. A Ninja leader quoted in a 2000 report claimed that there were \\"almost 16,000 Ninjas in the Pool region\\". According to a 2002 news report by IRIN News, analysts believed Ntoumi commanded \\"only a few hundred dedicated fighters and up to 3,000 more loosely attached\\", the latter of which were divided and unenthusiastic.  History = 1990s: Foundation and Civil War  The Republic of the Congo, formerly the People's Republic of the Congo (1970‚Äì1991), abolished its Marxist-Leninist one-party system in 1991. In the new multi-party state, rivaling political leaders formed their own militias. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President for much of the one-party era, formed the Cobra militia. Pascal Lissouba, elected President from 1992, formed the Ministerial Guard, or Cocoye militia, and the Zulu militia. Bernard Kol√©las, leader of the Mouvement Congolais pour la D√©mocratie et la D√©veloppement Integral (MCDDI) party, formed the Ninjas, recruiting from his party. After the disputed 1993 elections, violent conflict between the militias began. In this conflict, which lasted until 1994, the Ninjas were allied with Sassou Nguesso's Cobras against Lissouba's Cocoyes. In December 1995, the parties in the conflict signed a peace treaty where they agreed that militiamen aged 18‚Äì24 would be integrated into the national gendarmerie and police force. UNESCO also launched a plan to disarm the militias. These programs to pacify the country were controversial and unsuccessful, and the militias survived. In peacetime, the morale among the Ninjas suffered due to lack of payments. The Republic of the Congo Civil War began in June 1997, when the supporters of President Lissouba (including the Army and the Cocoye, Zulu, and Mamba militias) clashed with those of Denis Sassou Nguesso (including the Cobra militia and Sassou Nguesso's sympathizers in the army). Kol√©las, then Mayor of Brazzaville, was initially neutral. The Ninja-controlled districts of Brazzaville, Bacongo and Mak√©l√©k√©l√© therefore suffered far less casualties than the rest of the city during the first months of the war. In September, Kol√©las sided with Lissouba, and was installed as Prime Minister. The Ninjas thus entered the war on Lissouba's side. The alliance between the Ninjas and Lissouba's Cocoyes was formalized with the founding of the Mouvement National pour la Liberation du Congo (MNLC), but Ninja leaders such as Claude-Ernest Ndalla and Willy Matsanga opposed the alliance and defected with their men to Sassou Nguesso's side. Sassou Nguesso's forces, supported by Angola, took control of Brazzaville in October 1997, and overthrew Lissouba's government. Sassou Nguesso returned to the presidency. The Ninjas retreated to the Pool Department and fought an insurgency against the new government. In 1999, leaders of the Ninjas and Cocoyes signed a ceasefire agreement. Following the ceasefire and defeats against government forces, about 2000 Ninjas and Cocoyes surrendered to the government. The ceasefire agreement was condemned by Kol√©las. By 1999, American sources speculated if Kol√©las and Lissouba were no longer in control of their militias.  2000s: Pool insurgency  Map showing districts of Pool as well as Pool's location within the Republic of the Congo. There were several major clashes between government forces and Ninjas in 2002 and 2003, resulting in large humanitarian casualties. In March 2003, Ninja leaders signed agreements with the government to cease hostilities in Pool. Despite of the peace accords, many Ninja militiamen remained active, and engaged in robberies of civilians and train hijackings. As of 2009, active Ninja remnants still exist in the southern Pool. In June 2007, Ntoumi announced that the Ninjas were \\"going into constructive opposition\\" and were determined \\"to work for peace in Pool and across the country\\". Ninja members led by Ntoumi burned around 100 of their weapons in a ceremony in Kinkala. On June 10, 2008, the National Programme of Demobilisation, Disarmament and Reintegration (NPDDR), aiming to reintegrate ex-combatants from the wars of the 1990s and 2000s into civilian society, was launched. Ntoumi spoke at the launching in Kinkala and announced the disbanding of the Ninjas. He was offered a government post in September 2007, but remained in hiding until December 2009, when he went to Brazzaville to take up the post.

Violence continued with events such as shelling by the Congolese armed forces and attacks on trains by the Ninja militia. The Congolese government and the Ninja militia signed a ceasefire agreement on 23 December 2017.

They were employed to measure the time at sea or on a given navigational course, in repeated measures of small time increments (e.g., 30 minutes). Used together with the chip log, smaller marine sandglasses were also used to measure the boat speed through the water in knots. Although vital to maritime navigation, marine sandglasses were not accurate measuring instruments for the passage of time; many design and environmental factors could affect the duration of sand's flow, and therefore its reported time. Their use continued through the early 19th century, when they were supplanted by reliable mechanical timepieces, and by other advances in marine navigation. Marine sandglasses were very popular on board ships, as they were the most dependable measurement of time while at sea. Unlike the clepsydra, the motion of the ship while sailing did not affect the hourglass. The fact that the hourglass also used granular materials instead of liquids gave it more accurate measurements, as the clepsydra was prone to get condensation inside it during temperature changes.Balmer, R. T. \\"The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development.\\" Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632 Balmer, R. T. \\"The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development.\\" Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632. In conjunction with a record of a ship's speed and direction, seamen used the hourglass to determine their position with reasonable accuracy. Design and use Marine sandglasses originally consisted of two glass bottles one inverted above the other, connected by a small tube, with the ends wrapped and so joined together. Over time, the later progress in the art of glassblowing allowed them to be made in a single piece. The marine glass was filled with sand or a suitable material such as finely ground eggshell, lead or tin chips (used to avoid humidity). This flowing material was chosen with two main objectives: to avoid the humidity and to absorb motion, both required for shipboard use. Placed in the upper half, the sand would flow slowly and steadily towards the lower half by the action of gravity, taking a certain time to empty (that was calibrated during their design and manufacture). Once the upper portion of the glass was empty, the glass could be turned to measure another time period.  History = Antiquity  Sarcophagus dated ca 350 AD, representing the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (observe the magnification with the hourglass held by Morpheus in his hands) The origin of the hourglass is unclear, although unlike its predecessor the clepsydra, or water clock, which may have been invented in ancient Egypt, the first referenced use: *According to The American Institute of New York: The clepsammia or sand-glass was invented at Alexandria about 150 B. C. *According to the Journal of the British Archaeological Association: the so-called clepsammia were in use before the time of St Jerome (335 AD) *M.Llaurad√≥, found during an investigation, the first representation of an hourglass in a sarcophagus dated c. 350 AD, representing the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, discovered in Rome in the 18th century, and studied by Wincklemann in the 19th century, who remarked the hourglass held by Morpheus in his hands.  Middle age  Temperance bearing an hourglass; detail Lorenzetti's Allegory of Good Government, 1338 From the Roman time it disappears completely from historical records until it is re-introduced in medieval Europe.Mills, A. A., S. Day, and S.Parkes. \\"Mechanics of the sandglass.\\" Eur. J. Phys. 17 (1996): 97-109. By the 8th century it is mentioned by a monk named Luitprand, who served at the cathedral of Chartres, France.Hourglass history But it was not until the 14th century that the marine sandglass was seen commonly, the earliest firm evidence being a depiction in the 1338 fresco Allegory of Good Government by Ambrogio Lorenzetti. Use of the marine sandglass has been recorded since the 14th century; The written records about it were mostly from logbooks of European ships. In the same period it appears in other records and lists of ships stores. The earliest recorded reference that can be said with certainty to refer to a marine sandglass dates from c. 1345, in a receipt of Thomas de Stetesham, clerk of the King's ship La George, in the reign of Edward III of England; translated from the Latin, the receipt says: in 1345: > The same Thomas accounts to have paid at Lescluse, in Flanders, for twelve > glass horologes (\\" pro xii. orlogiis vitreis \\"), price of each 4¬Ω gross', in > sterling 9s. Item, For four horologes of the same sort (\\" de eadem secta \\"), > bought there, price of each five gross', making in sterling 3s. 4d. Another reference is found in an extensive inventory of the property of Charles V of France in his possession at the time of his death on September 16, 1380. One item is an hourglass from the king's study at his castle of St. Germain en Laye, described as follows: This \\"orloge de mer\\" or \\"heures de naviguer\\" was sent to him, as a present, when he still was a prince (being therefore prior to 1356 when he took the place of his imprisoned father), by his aunt Yolande of Aragon, when asking him for a manuscript of John de Mandeville, to be translated to the Aragonese tongue. Dotz√® del Cresti√† (Valencia-1484) The most interesting thing about the second reference, the one from King Charles, is that a common sand-glass is defined as \\"ung grant orloge de mer\\" or \\"a large sea clock\\", this together with the fact that the first explanation of its use at sea (found by M.Llaurad√≥) appears in the Francesc Eiximenis work \\"lo dotz√© del cresti√†\\" and that was given to him as a present by his aunt Yolande of Aragon, suggests that, at this period, the importance of a sand-glass was more commonly related to its use at sea and its fabrication demand may have been originated from the navigational needs from the Crown of Aragon a maritime power of the moment in the Mediterranean.Diccionari Catal√† Valenci√† Balear, Alcover-Moll: Rellotge de sorra. Item dos flascons d'hores, doc. mall., a. 1434 (Boll. Lul. Iii, 312)  Importance in navigation  Sandglass in a three-legged stand In long-distance navigation through the open ocean, the sandglass or \\"glass\\" used to measure the time was a tool as important as the compass (which indicated sailing direction, and so ship's course). Filled with the amount of sand suitable for measuring a lapse of half an hour, each time the sand emptied was also called a \\"glass\\"; eight glasses (four hours) defined a \\"watch\\". The times determined by the sandglass, along with the record in the logbook of the speed measured with the \\"chip log\\", permitted the ship's navigator to plot his map position. Multiplying the ship's speed by the time the course had been kept (measured with the glass), gave traveled distance, a simple, overall method termed dead reckoning. The marine sandglass was critical for maritime navigation before the 19th century. At the beginning of that century it became possible to navigate by the lunar distances, thanks to the tables of haversines of Joseph de Mendoza y R√≠os. Prior to this, dead reckoning navigation based on sandglass-determined times was used, alongside determination of latitude using the quadrant (see also backstaff, astrolabe, and octant); this was the only system available to mariners to navigate the globe. The parallel use of relative time measurements at sea, and time measurement by mechanical clocks on land continued from at least 1350 to 1805, i.e., for more than 450 years. Although vital to navigation, the marine glass was not an accurate instrument to measure the passage of time. The design of the glass affected its accuracy in time measurement; the uniformity in fineness of the sand, the inner diameter of the connecting tube, and design aspects allowing wear that would effect the flow of sand all could contribute. In addition, many shipboard factors could affect the duration of sand's flow and therefore influence the time measured, including the humidity inside the glass, the ability for it to be positioned in a perfectly vertical position, and the acceleration or deceleration of the ship's movements. Finally, the use of short duration glasses to measure long periods of time introduced further error. Marine glass use was supplanted by reliable mechanical timepieces, and by other advances in marine navigation. Watch sandglasses Ship log sandglass in the left of the ship's log. Watch sandglasses were used on ships to measure watch times, typically in half-hour periods. The helmsman or ship's page were the crewmen responsible for turning the watch sandglass, thus supplying the time to be registered on the ship's log; watch measurement began with the sun reaching its highest point‚Äîits zenith‚Äîat midday, which was likewise the essential time reference point for navigation. At that point in time, the ship's bell was struck eight times; after the first glass had emptied (half an hour), the ship's bell was struck once, after another glass, twice, and so on until four hours after midday, when it was again struck eight times. At that point, a new watch began, and the sequence was repeated. Hence, in the voyages of Columbus, there are records that his crew logged the passage of time using a half-hour \\"ampolleta\\" (glass) that was turned every time it emptied to keep track of the \\"canonical\\" hours. Likewise, during the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan to circumnavigate the globe, 18 hourglasses from Barcelona were in the ship's inventory, after the trip being authorized by emperor Charles V. Ship-log sandglass From the 16th century a much smaller 30-second \\"glass\\" was used along with the chip log, to measure the speed (in knots) of the vessel over the water.

The data distributed is collected from sources such as a stock exchange feeds, brokers and dealer desks or regulatory filings (e.g. an SEC filing).  History  Financial data vendors have been in existence as long as financial data has been available. The first technology that allowed data vendors to disseminate was the ticker tape starting in the 1870s. Financial data includes \\"pre-trade\\" such as bid/ask data necessary to price a financial instrument and post-trade data such as the last trade price and other transaction data. From ticker tape to television cameras, from databases to websites this multibillion-dollar industry provides data to trading rooms and consumers. Paper ticker tape became obsolete in the 1960s, as television and computers were increasingly used to transmit financial information. The concept of the stock ticker lives on, however, in the scrolling electronic tickers seen on brokerage walls and on news and financial television channels. Because the financial investment needed to provide the services needed, the industry had become ever more consolidated, but in 2004 it was forecast that the industry was beginning to fragment.Delaney AP.

Types of data  There are many different types of instruments (including stocks, bonds, funds, options, futures, currencies, etc.) and hundreds of different markets for investment, leading to an extremely large and hard to define universe of data.Anderson D. (2005). The market data 'industry' 2005. 'The Handbook of World Stock, Derivative and Commodity Exchanges. The types of data offered vary by vendor, and most typically cover information about entities (companies) and instruments (shares, bonds etc.) which companies might issue. Typically, pricing data is sold separately from other related data, such as corporate actions and events, valuation information, fundamental data including company performance and reference data on the entities and instruments themselves. In addition to market price data there are data known as market reference data, such as a ticker name, which describe securities, commodities and transactions. Intraday Data are prices provided during the day, they are usually released every 15 minutes. The majority of financial data vendors can access data during trading sessions but with the requirement that any inquiry be in reference to historical market analysis. Analysis of historical market data provides a larger snapshot of the market at the expense of timely information (time inbetween database updates).  Services offered  Most of the market differentiation between competitors is based on some combination of the following: * Delivery frequency - Data can be updated in Real-Time, Delayed, Conflated, or End of Day * Delivery latency - vendors offer different amounts of data latency, with lower latency typically being more expensive and more complex. An individual vendor may offer different products with different latencies. * Delivery method - Data is delivered either in a streaming format, or as snapshot files of streamed data, or as \\"end of day\\" files showing the position at the close of business of a certain market or region * Delivery transportation - Data can be delivered via Broadcast, Multicast, Satellite, Private Line, VPN, or Internet * Delivery format - Data can be encoded heavily to optimize performance, or can be left in simple formats to simplify databasing * Normalization and Data Model - Vendors collect from sources all around the world and then translates all of those formats into a single format (by vendor or by product) for consumption by either a financial data processor or by the end user. Each vendor typically has a different way of modelling financial data. * Reliability - High availability of data is a primary concern in the financial markets * Value Added Services - Data value can be improved by adding on related services such as listing information, share data, fundamental data, time series, historical data, etc. * Local experience - Larger data vendors have sales and service offices and data centers worldwide in major financial centers in the US, Europe and Asia. This allows their customers to access local expertise without having to have a local presence.  Global nature  Many vendors began as local companies, serving their own local markets. However, through merger and acquisition and in response to the increasing globalisation of world markets, many vendors now describe themselves as global.

Overview Isha l'Isha, Aswat, Kayan and the Haifa Rape Crisis Center have gained international recognition. In 2008, Aswat was awarded the Go visible Award of the city of Vienna, an initiative of the Austrian Green Party. Rauda Morcos, then the head of Aswat, was awarded the Felipa de Souza Award of the OutRight Action International in 2006. Aswat was the first public organization for Arab lesbians in the Middle East and Rauda Morcos was for a long time the only openly gay member of Aswat. The group has supporters in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, but most Arab lesbians hide their sexual preferences for fear of reprisals. The first conference of Aswat in March 2008 was met with a high level of response from supporters but also from opponents of gay rights. Israel's Islamic Movement had requested cancellation of the conference. The organizers refused, and members of the Islamic Movement demonstrated in front of the conference building.Haaretz: First Israeli Arab conference of lesbians convened in Haifa Aswat aims to strengthen cooperation with feminist organizations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The women see their struggle for gay rights in connection to the Palestinian struggle against the occupation, and also aim to show solidarity with Palestinian homosexuals in the OPT whose situation is even more difficult than that of Palestinian homosexuals in Israel.The Guardian: Coming Out in Arabic Kayan called public and media attention inter alia with its research about mobility among women in Arab villages and towns in Northern Israel. This first study of the topic showed the complete lack of public transportation in Israel's Arab localities, and convinced the Ministry of Transport to install bus lines in Sakhnin, Arara, Umm el Fahm and other Arab towns and villages. The project \\"Women Demand Mobility\\" also involved women's community activism in Mghar and other villages without public transportation, where women installed bus lines out of their own initiative.Report: Government should subsidize public transport in Arab communities / No buses means Arab women can't work Israeli media also reported widely about an environmental project where women from Mghar raise environmental awareness among children and youth. Environmental work by women is a novelty in Arab society, empowers women and helps the community at the same time.Women bring green revolution to Arab sector Isha l'Isha's achievements for the prevention of trafficking of women are of utmost importance. The organization succeeded in raising public awareness for the problem, including the installation of a parliamentary committee that deals with the issue. Traffickers of women face heavier punishments today thanks to Isha l'Isha's initiative, and Isha l'Isha is regarded a central reference and expert on the topic in Israel.Rita Chaikin: Fighting against Trafficking in Women in the North of Israel In July 2000, the Haifa Rape Crisis Center, along with the other nine national rape crisis centers, received the Volunteer Award presented by the President of Israel. The award is in recognition of the Centers‚Äô ‚Äú important pioneering contribution to Israeli Society‚Äù and their ‚Äúcontribution to the uprooting of the epidemic of sexual violence from Israeli Society and on the support given to survivors.‚Äù Criticism Especially the quarter policy of the Israeli feminist movement, which is also implemented in the Haifa Women's Coalition, is subject to criticism. The quarter policy aims to ensure equal representation of Israel's large population groups - Mizrahi women (Jews who descend from the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and the Caucasus), Ashkenazi women (Jews who descend from European countries), Lesbian and Palestinian women. On the one hand, there are basic discussions about the implementation and usefulness of this policy. On the other hand, it is asked why Russian women, a large minority in Israel today, are not represented.Dalia Sachs/ Hannah Safran: Equal Representation in a Divided Society: The Feminist Experience in Israel In reaction to this criticism, the quarter system was expanded to accommodate additional groups that make up Israeli society. The different identities of the women are an ongoing topic of discussion. Women from minority groups often feel dominated by Ashkenazi women and unequally represented. The building of coalitions and the sharing of resources shall provide answers to these questions.Kalpana Misra/ Melanie S. Rich: Jewish Feminism in Israel.

Origin According to a 2008 paper by Sara Seager and Linda Elkins-Tanton, there are probably two ways in which a coreless planet may form. In the first, the planet accretes from chondrite-like fully oxidized water-rich material, where all the metallic iron is bound into silicate mineral crystals. Such planets may form in cooler regions farther from the central star. In the second, the planet accretes from both water-rich and iron metal-rich material. However, the metal iron reacts with water to form iron oxide and release hydrogen before differentiation of a metal core has taken place. Provided the iron droplets are well mixed and small enough (<1 centimeter), the predicted end result is that the iron is oxidized and trapped in the mantle, unable to form a core. Magnetic field Earth's magnetic field results from its flowing liquid metallic core, according to the dynamo theory, but in super-Earths the mass can produce high pressures with large viscosities and high melting temperatures which could prevent the interiors from separating into different layers and so result in undifferentiated coreless mantles. Magnesium oxide, which is rocky on Earth, can be liquid at the pressures and temperatures found in super-Earths and could generate a magnetic field in the mantles of super- Earths.Super-Earths Get Magnetic 'Shield' from Liquid Metal, Charles Q.

Early life and family Philip de Lange was probably born near Strasbourg and was trained as a mason in the Netherlands. He arrived in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1729 where he quickly gained a reputation as an architect and master builder.Philip de Lange. From Den store Danske. In Danish. Retrieved 13 January 2010. Achievements De Lange created a large number of works of various types including civil and military buildings, mansions, country houses, warehouses, factories, churches and parks. The Dutch Baroque influence in his early work can, for example, be seen in the premises he built for Ziegler, the pastry cook, at Nybrogade 12 (1732).Philip de Lange. From KunstIndeks Danmark. In Danish. Retrieved 13 January 2010. While initially he appears to have been struck by Ewert Janssen's earlier work, he soon seems to have been influenced by Elias H√§usser and Lauritz de Thurah. Like Krieger, he participated strongly in creating fine bourgeois dwellings in Copenhagen, especially the gabled houses on K√∏bmagergade. His most notable achievements include the Headquarters of the Asiatic Company in Christianshavn (1739), the Masting Crane on Holmen (1750) and Stephen Hansen's Mansion in Helsing√∏r (1763). He also adapted Glorup Manor on Funen to the Baroque style adding a magnificent mansard roof (1744).Glorup Gods. In Danish. Retrieved 13 January 2010.

He made his debut during the episode broadcast on 8 July 2008. He has been central to many notable storylines including shooting dead Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien), his time working as a Sergeant of Summer Bay's police force and his relationship with Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). In 2011, it was revealed that Jacobz had been written out of the serial as producers felt there was \\"nowhere else to go\\" with Angelo. The character departed on 21 June 2011. In February 2020, it was announced that Jacobz had agreed to reprise the role. Angelo returned on 13 August 2020 to investigate a murder, following his promotion to detective. Casting Actor Luke Jacobz joined the cast of Home and Away in June 2008, following the cancellation of McLeod's Daughters, with which he had a recurring role. He previously appeared in the serial in the nineties as three different guest characters. Jacobz told a TV Week writer that producers were looking for \\"an outgoing Italian\\", and while Jacobz is not Italian, he decided to attend the audition anyway. He had recently relocated from South Australia to Sydney to sign up to work as a labourer when he received the offer to play Angelo. He was on set filming his first scenes four days later. Jacobz was originally signed to the show for six months. Development=Characterisation Jacobz said Angelo is \\"of Italian extraction\\", but his family is from the north, which explains his lighter hair colour. He described him as \\"really confident with the ladies in his job as a police officer ‚Äì he thinks he's a bit of alright.\\" He also thought Angelo was a combination of himself and his character Patrick from McLeod Daughters. The serial's official website describe Angelo stating: \\"Growing up in a close-knit family; with three brothers, Angelo was generally perceived as the loudmouth, boofhead kid who would never amount to much.\\" They also state that his passion to solve crimes leads him to step over the line. Angelo has been portrayed as having a very confident manner, during an interview with Yahoo!7 Jacobz describes his characters stating: \\"He's a cheeky cop. He's very confident. He's not arrogant at all, it's not as if he's got attitude. He's a confident guy, and he knows what he's doing in the police force. He like the ladies. He's outgoing and he's always in a good mood.\\" Jacobz said Angelo searches for love upon his arrival. stating: \\"He's looking for the right one ‚Äì He's shopping around\\". Angelo immediately asks his colleague Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) out to dinner, which surprises her. Jacobz teased that Angelo would have a date or two in the future, but not necessarily with Charlie. Angelo and Charlie date, but later split up. He begins dating May Stone (Alin Sumarwata), Charlie becomes jealous. Of the storyline commented on Angelo stating: \\"She admits part of her wanted to cause trouble, but Angelo is still attracted to Charlie and they sleep together.\\" However Angelo doesn't want to reunite with her straight away, Anderson comments that Angelo is left wanting to do the right thing and stand by May. Shooting Jack Holden Angelo shoots and kills Jack Holden, played by Paul O'Brien (pictured), leading to him being dubbed \\"Summer Bay's most hated citizen\\". Towards the end of 2008, Angelo shoots and kills fellow officer Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien). Jacobz believed Angelo lost all sympathy from viewers, as Jack was a popular character. He relished played Summer Bay's most hated character, saying \\"For many years I've played the likeable characters that never do anything wrong, so it's been great to walk into a room and have daggers thrown at you. It's good playing a character that isn't liked. Everyone hates him and it's been great to play something new.\\" Angelo is eventually charged with Jack's murder. Jacobz told an Inside Soap columnist that Angelo has been consumed with guilt since the shooting, and he has no doubts that he killed Jack. But his lawyer finds some new evidence concerning a second gunshot during the investigation, which offers Angelo \\"a glimmer of hope\\". Until it is proved, Angelo decides to change his plea to not guilty. Charlie is forced to tell Jack's widow Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon) the news, and Jacobz said that she is \\"distressed\\" and does not want Angelo to go free because of a technicality. During a walk-through of the crime scene, Martha confronts Angelo and accuses him of trying to get away with Jack's murder. Jacobz stated \\"He understands where she's coming from. Martha's life has been ripped apart. Angelo's prepared to take responsibility for that, but if there's a chance that he didn't kill Jack, he has to explore it.\\" Angelo temporarily leaves the Bay, but in \\"a dramatic twist\\" he returns to conduct a special investigation. Jacobz told Jason Herbison of Inside Soap that Angelo left the Bay as the most hated man in town, so no one is pleased to see him back. They are also struggling to accept that he was acquitted of Jack's murder. Jacobz said that Angelo understands how they feel, as he does not want to be in the Bay either, but he had no choice. Angelo now works for Marine Area Command and is trying to find a shark who has attacked and killed a person, after a severed hand washes up on the beach. Angelo and his team are tasked with trying to find out who the hand belongs to and what happened. Jacobz joked that while everyone is worried about further attacks, some of the locals are more scared of Angelo. Angelo apologises to Jack's father Tony Holden (Jon Sivewright) for his return and assures him that he will be leaving as soon as the case is solved. He later learns that Martha is so scared of him, she will not leave her home. Jacobz commented \\"Angelo feels terrible, and wants to assure her she has no reason to fear him.\\" He visits Martha, who barely speaks due to shock, but she later unleashes her pent-up anger on him when they meet again. Jacobz said \\"she lets Angelo know exactly what she thinks of him!\\" The actor also teased that the severed hand would be the beginning of a bigger mystery, which unfolds over several months. Brother's arrival Producers introduced the character's younger brother Paulie Rosetta (Ryan Johnson) in August 2010, leading to further exploration of Angelo's fictional backstory. Speaking with Carolyn Stewart of TV Week, Johnson said Paulie \\"has always been the starry-eyed dreamer in the family\\" and his \\"desire to think big\\" has often landed him in trouble. Growing up, Paulie was always doing crazy things and Angelo had to bail him out. Angelo is not happy to see his brother in town, especially when he starts flirting with Charlie. Johnson commented that Paulie's arrival surprises Angelo, and as he has had to take the blame for his brother's mistakes in the past, he knows that Paulie showing up unannounced means things are not going well. Johnson added \\"If Paulie's in town, there has to be some sort of agenda. Angelo's waiting for the truth to come out.\\" Angelo's suspicions that Paulie has an ulterior motive for coming to see him soon comes to fruition when Paulie reveals that he is in financial trouble. He asks for his brother's help, but due to their past Angelo is hesitant bail him out again. It later emerges that the reason for the brothers' bad relationship was an accident in which Paulie's set fire to their parents' restaurant. Angelo took the blame and was subsequently kicked out of the family business. Paulie took over the running of the business, but \\"bit off more than he could chew\\" and he believes Angelo is the only one who can help him. Angelo later lends Paulie a large sum of money to gamble at the races with. Charlie is \\"furious\\" with Angelo for lying to her and insists that they leave. Steve Peacocke and Dan Ewing (pictured left to right) play Brax and Heath, Angelo's business partner and his brother, who attacks him. Braxton brothers and attack Angelo goes through a career change and opens his own Italian restaurant in the surf club. He soon goes into business with the newly arrived Darryl \\"Brax\\" Braxton (Steve Peacocke). When Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) tells Angelo that Brax's brother Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing) supplied him with drugs, Angelo \\"grows suspicious\\" and he later deduces that Brax and Heath are running a drugs operation. He follows Brax to a national park where he encounters \\"a vicious guard dog\\". Angelo later goes missing after trying to prove Brax and Heath are dealing drugs. Peacocke told an Inside Soap writer \\"Brax has warned Angelo to keep his nose of out of his business. But Angelo isn't intimidated, and when Brax says he needs to take care of something for a few days, Angelo thinks it's an opportunity to catch him and his brothers up to no good.\\" Angelo finds Heath and his friends tending to a large drugs crop, so he calls Charlie and leaves a message telling her what is going on. Angelo is then hit over the head with a shovel, and Heath contacts Brax to tell him that he has \\"taken care\\" of Angelo. Meanwhile Charlie finds the crop and Heath nearby, but no Angelo. Peacocke said there is suggestion of foul play, and added \\"Has Heath actually killed Angelo? It's not beyond the realms of possibility...\\" Angelo is taken to the hospital by Brodie Upton (Guy Edmonds), where he remains in a coma. Brodie becomes the prime suspect in Angelo's attack and is arrested for assault, but the police need Angelo to wake up and give a statement. Peacocke said that his character really dislikes being brought into the situation, but as his brother is involved, Brax feels like \\"he's the one who has to clean up the mess.\\" An Inside Soap columnist observed that there was a lot at stake when Angelo awakens, as Brax is also in a secret relationship with Charlie, who immediately goes to the hospital to question Angelo. Of what happens, Peacocke explained \\"Brax is worried that Angelo will spill the beans and implicate Heath as well as Brodie. However, Angelo actually lies and claims that he doesn't remember what happened.\\" Following this, Brodie gets himself transferred to the hospital where he takes Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) hostage and tries to escape the Bay with Brax's help. Departure In February 2011, a writer for TV Week announced that Jacobz had left Home and Away. They said Jacobz would be seen on screen for a few more months, but the actor had finished filming. On his departure from the show, Jacobz said \\"I've thoroughly enjoyed playing Angelo. I've worked with some amazing people ‚Äì and, as they say, when one door closes, another door opens. So I'm looking forward to what's next... here or abroad.\\" The following month Jacobz revealed that it was not his decision to leave Home and Away and that the show's bosses decided to write his character out as they felt he had \\"nowhere else to go.\\" Jacobz explained, \\"When they said the character was leaving I was upset, because I love working on the show. It was really that the character had reached all the different goals that the show wanted him to, and it worked out really well with storylines having the River Boys come in so that Angelo could go.\\" Jacobz later explained that just as his contract with Home and Away was ending, Seven asked him to host The X Factor. He recalled \\"I actually got called off set. I think Cameron Welsh was the EP of Home & Away and he said, 'You need to ring (programming boss) Tim Worner.' Next thing you know I was getting a photo shoot that day and the following Sunday we were on air.\\" Jacobz admitted that he would have stayed with Home and Away, but the time needed to prepare for both shows would have been too much. Return On 15 February 2020, it was announced that Jacobz would return to the show after nine years off-screen. Of his return Jacobz stated \\"I'm so excited that my first scene back is with Ray Meagher who plays Alf Stewart! We all have so much to catch up on.\\" A Home and Away publicist told Claire Crick from What's on TV that they were \\"thrilled\\" about Jacobz's return. They added that Angelo would be \\"back on the police force with everything to prove.\\" Jacobz later explained that he was contacted by the show's producers in January. They asked him how he felt about his character returning to the Bay, and he said it was \\"very good\\". Jacobz began preparing for his return immediately with a new haircut and a wardrobe fitting. He said he would be on the show for \\"a good few months\\" and confirmed that Angelo was not coming back to be killed off. Jacobz filmed with the show for five weeks until production was temporarily shutdown due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Angelo returns on 13 August 2020. He has since rejoined the police force and is now a detective. He returns to the Bay to investigate a murder. Jacobz said his character has \\"a lot of hunches, some things that he thinks he can follow up. But unfortunately a group of people try to put Angelo off the scent. Some of them try to protect each other, so it's not an open and shut case for Angelo. They don't make his job easy at all.\\" Producers also cast Annabelle Stephenson as Angelo's wife Taylor Rosetta. Storylines Angelo replaces Jack Holden at Yabbie Creek Police Station when he takes time off to deal with Martha MacKenzie's cancer diagnosis. He flirts with Charlie Buckton on an assignment and asks her out but she rejects him. He then turns his attention to Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) who refuses at first but only goes out with Angelo to make her boyfriend Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) jealous. When Belle is held hostage by Aden, Angelo rescues her. They form a friendship which develops into something more. The first test in the relationship is when Angelo is forced to arrest Belle when she protests at a development site but convinces Charlie to drop the charges. Belle later receives threats from the developers, which become a reality when Angelo is attacked. After Belle reunites with Aden, Angelo is incensed and loses his temper, trashing the beach house. That evening, Belle is attacked and Angelo is a suspect. He becomes a pariah in Summer Bay and turns to developer Tim Coleman (Kieran Darcy-Smith) for help. In exchange for clearing his name, Angelo switches the soil samples to get the investigation against the developers dropped. Belle's attacker Eric \\"Nobby\\" Nobbes (Mark Casamento) is arrested and Angelo pays his bail. Nobby is later killed in a confrontation with Tim and Angelo is warned to back off. Angelo then saves Belle's life when a gunman menaces them. Angelo receives a phone call from Tim, who tells him to meet him at the site. Jack has a feeling that Angelo might know something about some alleged toxic waste around the site and follows him there. Jack arrives and Angelo calls out Tim's name several times, but receives no reply. While Jack watches Angelo from behind a tree, a shot is fired in Angelo's direction. Frightened, Angelo draws his revolver and hears a second shot which is even closer, and points his gun ahead. He hears a noise behind him, turns around and shoots twice, resulting in Jack being hit in the chest. Angelo hears Jack fall and thinks it is Tim but realises it is Jack and runs away in shock, leaving him dying at the site. He tries to cover up the killing but Charlie is suspicious and sets up a plan to catch Angelo out. At Jack's wake, Angelo is exposed by Martha when she tells Jack's father Tony, who lashes out Angelo but is restrained by several friends. Angelo confesses to killing Jack. He is then arrested and charged. However, he returns several months later under a special investigation into people smuggling as part of the Marine Area Command division of the police. His return upsets and angers Jack's friends and family. Angelo uncovers Jack's cousin Hugo Austin (Bernard Curry) is the mastermind behind the operation. Hugo refuses to admit anything and he is escorted to a city police station. Hugo is shot and Angelo fabricates a story to Hugo's family that Hugo is dead but in reality Hugo has made a deal. Angelo and Charlie are later promoted to Sergeant and Leading Senior Constable, respectively, which causes jealousy on Charlie's part as Angelo is now her superior. They later split and agree to be just friends. Angelo then discovers Hugo is in hiding with Martha and Senior Detective Gordon Eaves (Lewis Fitz- Gerald) is a corrupt police officer bent on bringing Hugo down. Angelo and Charlie arrest Eaves. Angelo then arrests Hugo and Martha but lets them get away before they can be charged. As a result, Angelo is dismissed from the force and Charlie takes his position. He then starts his own restaurant, Angelo's, in the upper floor of the Surf Club. Angelo's younger brother Paulie Rosetta is mistaken as a food critic by Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) and Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood). It becomes clear that Angelo bears a grudge towards Paulie when he greets his brother with a frosty reception. It also annoys Angelo that everybody, including Charlie all seem taken by Paulie's outgoing nature and charming ways. The reason for Angelo's resentment is because Paulie inherited the family restaurants and Angelo had taken the blame for a fire when they were younger. It emerges Paulie is in some hot water with loan sharks and Angelo agrees to help him. Charlie tries to assist with some illegal money left by Hugo but Angelo refuses. He borrows $3,000 from the bank and tells Charlie the debt is paid. After finding out Angelo and Paulie have gambled the money, Charlie is angry and forces them to call their parents and they bail out Paulie. The brothers then mend their feud. Angelo hosts a singles' night at the restaurant, which is gatecrashed by the River Boys. After they get drunk, they begin a brawl. Angelo goes into business with Darryl \\"Brax\\" Braxton, after Brax helps the restaurant make a profit. Angelo later becomes uneasy with his new partnership, especially when Brax changes the menu. Angelo becomes good friends with Nicole Franklin and he helps deliver her son, George. They then begin a relationship. When Angelo discovers a large marijuana crop being harvested in the forest, he calls Charlie to let her know, before being knocked out by Heath Braxton. Angelo is taken to the hospital where he remains unconscious. He wakes up and tells Charlie that he does not remember what happened, but when he warns Nicole, she realises that he does. Brodie Upton holds Nicole hostage and Angelo helps talk him down. Angelo discovers that Charlie is dating Brax and try to warn her about him. Angelo manages to blackmail Brax into buying him out of the business and he and Nicole leave Summer Bay with George. Angelo and Nicole later meet up with Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) in the city when she comes to visit George. Angelo returns to Summer Bay nine years later, having rejoined the police force as a detective, to investigate the murder of Ross Nixon (Justin Rosniak). He questions and interviews Colby Thorne (Tim Franklin) about the day Ross took his sister Bella Nixon (Courtney Miller), his wife Chelsea Campbell (Ashleigh Brewer) and friend Willow Harris (Sarah Roberts) hostage. Angelo also asks Colby to tell Dean Thompson (Patrick O'Connor) that he wants to interview him too. Reception Jacobz received a nomination for the Logie Award for Most Popular Actor in 2010 for his portrayal of Angelo. In the same year, he was also nominated for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. Holy Soap recall Angelo's most memorable moment as being: \\"Shooting Jack Holden, of course!\\" A reporter for The Daily Telegraph branded Angelo \\"the most hated character on Home and Away\\", after he killed Jack.

He was President of the Edinburgh Geological Society 1950-52 and was awarded the Lyell Medal by the Geological Society of London in 1954. Life Simpson was born on the Glenferness estate near Ardclach, Nairnshire, the son of Thomas Simpson, the estate manager. After schooling at Nairn Academy, he went to the University of Aberdeen, where he graduated with a BSc in Agriculture, in 1914. At the outbreak of the First World War he joined the Royal Engineers, and was later commissioned in the Gordon Highlanders. He was wounded, and badly gassed, during active service in France. He returned to civilian life in 1918, and resumed his studies at the University of Aberdeen later that year, graduating in 1920 with a degree in Pure Science, with special distinction in Geology. Later in 1920, he was appointed to the field staff of the Geological Survey in Scotland. He was promoted to Senior Geologist in 1932, and to District Geologist in 1945. He retired in 1954. His work with the Survey fell into two broad categories. He carried out a lot of the early earliest mapping of the Western Highlands and Islands of Scotland, including the Lewisian of Coll and Tiree, the Mesozoic sediments and Tertiary lavas of Morvern and Ardnamurchan, and the Moine Schists of Ardnamurchan, Sunart and South Morar. Some of his most important work concerned the Scottish Coalfields and their associated rocks, in Ayrshire, Dumfriesshire, Dumbartonshire, Lanarkshire and Midlothian, leading to significant upward revisions to reserves estimates. He mapped superficial deposits, in particular the boulder clays of Ayrshire, which led to new time- correlations of glacial events in Scotland and Scandinavia. Some of this work was submitted to the University of Aberdeen for his doctorate (DSc), which was conferred on him in 1933. The other aspect of his work built on his early agricultural and botanical training, and he became a recognised authority on fossil pollen. In large part, this work was \\"private research\\", as opposed to \\"official\\", meaning that it was done in his spare time, not as part of his Survey duties. The work led to significant conclusions, though, and was published in journals such as the Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was elected a Fellow of the Society in 1932 his proposers being John Smith Flett, Murray Macgregor, James Ernest Richey and Robert Campbell. He was a contributor to the Geological Magazine, and the Transactions of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Geological Societies. He became a Fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1949. He was awarded the Clough Medal by the Edinburgh Geological Society, for the period 1953-4,\\"Clough Medallists & Memorial Award\\" Edinburgh Geological Society. Retrieved 15 January 2010. and the Lyell Medal by the Geological Society of London, in 1954. Many undergraduates studying geology and, as part of their practical training having to interpret the Sanquhar sheet, in Southern Scotland, will have thanked him for the challenges set by his mapping this complex geological setting. He retired in 1954 and died near his birthplace on 28 June 1960.https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/Archive/May-2013/John-Baird- Simpson Two obituaries capture the character of the man nicely: \\"Johnnie Simpson was a man of exceptional kindliness, generosity and charm, loved by all of his friends ... [his professional] reputation was the result of a patient and selfless devotion to research worthy of the high traditions of Scottish natural science\\";Royal Society of Edinburgh Year Book, 1959-60 and \\"To be his companion on a Highland traverse was ... both an inspiration and memory to treasure. He possessed other qualities - an innate courtesy, forbearance, helpfulness and loyalty - which gained for him the affection of many friends and for which he will long be remembered ... the end came as he himself might surely have wished it to come. He was found lying peacefully by the banks of his beloved [River] Findhorn with his rod and line stretched out over its grey waters. The country laddie from Glenferness had travelled far and risen high but had come home at last.\\"Proceedings of the Geological Society of London, October 1960.

Her style was partially inspired by Latin American music.  Biography  Navarov√° studied Spanish and Czech language at the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy of the Charles University in Prague. A part of her studies Navarov√° spent in Havana, Cuba where she took music inspiration for her later career. Following her studies she began to work as a teacher. At the end of the 1980s, together with fellow musicians from Nerez, she studied also at the Prague Conservatory. Although she began her music career as a student, with the band V√Ωlety, her breakthrough only came in early 1980s, when she joined Nerez. She met co-founding members of Nerez, Zdenƒõk V≈ôe≈°≈•√°l and V√≠t S√°zavsk√Ω, during her studies in Prague. The performances with the band brought her first critical acclaim and popularity.

History The concerto was begun, at the suggestion of Serge Koussevitzky, in the summer of 1927‚Äîalthough the composer later postdated the beginning of this work to his years at the American Academy in Rome in 1928 and 1929,Olmstead 2008, 246‚Äîand was completed in 1935.Babbitt 2003, 394.Schubart 1946, 212. It was originally meant to have been premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra during their 1932‚Äì33 season, with Richard Burgin as soloist, but Sessions did not finish the finale‚Äîoriginally to have been the third movement‚Äîin time.Olmstead 2008, 247. Ultimately deciding on a four- movement form, Sessions delivered the violin part to Burgin in the fall of 1934, while still orchestrating the last movement, and Koussevitzky agreed to program the concerto during the first half of the 1935‚Äì36 season.Olmstead 2008, 247‚Äì48. When Sessions expressed a preference for a better-known violinist, Burgin graciously stepped aside and Joseph Szigeti was named as the probable soloist.Olmstead 2008, 248; Anon. 1935. The Concerto was finally completed in San Francisco in August 1935,Sessions 1937, 98. and the premiere was scheduled to take place in November 1936, but the now-intended soloist, Albert Spalding, asked for a postponement and requested that Sessions compose a new finale. Sessions declined and released the violinist of his obligation to perform the concerto. Spalding could not master the violin part, especially the \\"punishingly fast\\" tarantella finale, and the performance was cancelled at the last minute.Olmstead 2008, 249. The concerto was finally given its first performance with a professional orchestra by Louis Krasner and the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos, on November 14, 1947,Steinberg 2000, 430‚Äì33.Olmstead 2008, 250. though an earlier performance had been given in Chicago on January 8, 1940, by Robert Arthur Gross, the WPA Illinois Symphony Orchestra, and Izler Solomon, and Gross also performed the first two movements in 1941 with the National Youth Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski. It is dedicated to Sessions' first wife, Barbara.Sessions 1937, 1. The concerto's advocates have included Tossy Spivakovsky (who gave the New York premiere with Leonard Bernstein conducting in 1959);Henahan 1968, 385. more recently, it has been performed by David Schneider,West Coast premiere under Josef Krips, in 1968, see http://sfgate.com/bayarea/article/David- Schneider-longtime-violinist-with-the-San-2575436.php and Ole Bohn, who has made the work's second recording. Style and form Sessions regarded his concerto as a pronounced move away from his previous neoclassical style.Cone and Sessions 1966, 39. It marks the beginning of his characteristic, unique style featuring extended, continuously flowing sections in which ideas surface, gain clarity and definition, and then recede again into the general flow.Carter 1959, 380. It is in four movements: #Largo e tranquillo, con grande espressione (ca. 9‚Äì11 minutes)Timings from Zukofsky's and Bohn's recordings, to give an idea of the proportions of the work. #Scherzo (Allegro) (ca. 6‚Äì8 minutes) #Romanza (Andante) (ca. 4 minutes) #Molto vivace e sempre con fuoco (ca. 10‚Äì11 minutes) The first movement opens with two motifs, a rising diatonic segment in the trombone consisting of the first five notes of the B minor scale, and a more intense, jagged line in the trumpet, in a rapidly rising and falling pattern covering a diminished eleventh. These two figures occur throughout the entire concerto, and serve to unify the whole.Carter 1959, 377‚Äì79. The third movement is joined to the finale by a cadenza for the soloist, which employs a sort of metric modulation in which the violin accelerates through a measure of thirty-seconds to a bridge passage of sextuplet thirty-seconds, entering the finale with a passage equivalent in basic pulse though not in speed with the previous movement.Henahan 1968, 386.

Background  The (GAF) comprising twelve Belgian divisions, ten divisions of the British Second Army and six divisions of the French Sixth Army, under the command of King Albert I of Belgium, with the French General Jean Degoutte as Chief of Staff, defeated the German 4th Army in the Fifth Battle of Ypres The breaking of the Hindenburg Line further south, led the Allies to follow a strategy of pursuing the Germans for as long as possible, before movement was stopped by the winter rains. Mud and a collapse of the supply-system, had stopped the advance in early October but by the middle of the month, the GAF was ready to resume the offensive. Battle The offensive began at on 14 October, with an attack by the GAF from the Lys river at Comines northwards to Dixmude. The British creeping barrage advanced at a rate of per minute, much faster and much further than the practice in 1917, in expectation that there would be little resistance from German infantry. By the evening the British forces had reached high ground which dominated Werviq, Menin and Wevelghem in the south; further north the British captured Moorslede and closed up to Gulleghem and Steenbeek. Belgian troops on the left reached Iseghem, French troops surrounded Roulers and more Belgian troops captured Cortemarck. Roulers fell the next day and by 16 October, the British held the north bank of the Lys up to Harelbeke and had crossed the river at several points. By 17 October, Thourout, Ostend, Lille and Douai had been recaptured; Bruges and Zeebrugge fell by 19 October and the Dutch border was reached the following day. The crossing of the Lys and the capture of Courtrai by the British Second Army on 19 October, led to a German retreat on the front of the Fifth Army further south, which encircled Lille on 18 October. Next day the British were in Roubaix and Tourcoing and by the evening of 22 October, the British had reached the Scheldt from Valenciennes to Avelghem. Aftermath Western Front, 16 October 1918 A new offensive would be launched by the GAF on 30 October, which would be ended by the Armistice signed on 11 November. By the time the Armistice had been signed, the front was an average of east of the old front line and ran from Terneuzen to Ghent, along the River Scheldt to Ath and from there to Saint-Ghislain, where it joined with the BEF positions on the Somme.

It is found from India to the Philippines, Sulawesi, Java, and Sri Lanka. Female Female from Borneo Upperside and wing venation Description The wingspan is 65‚Äì100 mm. Adults are on wing from May to June with a possible second brood from August to September. Male is brown, ochreous, yellowish to reddish. Forewings are consisted with a waved anti- medial dark line and a small hyaline spot beyond the end of the cell, with one or two others above it. The upper one is a dark spot. Hindwings with oblique line continued to the inner margin before the middle. There is a hyaline spot beyond the cell. Ventral side is much purple. Female is red. There are three large irregularly shaped hyaline spots beyond the cell of the forewing, often with one or two small sides inside them. Larva is blackish brown with red spots in color and hairy. There are six setiferous tubercles in each somite from 2nd to 11th. First somite and anal claspers are crimson colored. Legs and prolegs are brown colored. The larvae have been recorded on Anacardium, Mangifera, Spondias, Careya, Bischofia, Canarium, Quercus, Cinnamomum, Machilus, Persea, Acrocarpus, Ziziphus, Malus, Prunus, Pyrus, Salix and Schleichera species. Pupa At this phase, a tube that releases golden silk fibres replaces the mouth as they do not eat. After passing the last frass, each pupa will begin to spin golden cocoon between one or several leaves. Cocoon composed of bright golden yellow silk firmly united into a network. The female spins larger cocoon than the male to accommodate its larger size. The golden cocoon is usually completed in about 8 hours. This incubation phase normally lasts for 21 ‚Äì 26 days. However, during radical climate condition, it may last for 2 ‚Äì 3 months. Distribution=Javanese population On the island of Java, Cricula silk moths are usually seen on wing around August, with a possible second brood from January to February. However, due to drastic climate changes, it is getting harder to predict their appearances. Unlike the domesticated Bombyx Mori silkworm which feeds solely on mulberry leaves, the Cricula is a polyphagous. This means that it is capable of feeding on a variety of host plants. In Java, Cricula feeds on the leaves of cashew, soursop, avocado, mahogany; with a keen preference towards cashew leaves. With technology collaboration with Japan, the naturally golden cocoons have been successfully utilised into wild silk yarns and other crafts, creating a source of income for the local villagers. In 2019, the utilisation of Cricula golden cocoons have been recognised by the United Nation as a sustainable practice, inline with UNSDG2030.  Utilisations = Introduction  Since 1994 to present day, the cocoons of the wild silk moth: Cricula trifenestrata are utilised for the production of wild silk yarns. This practice has also brought a long run impact on afforestation as an initiative to preserve the moth's natural habitat by active tree planting.  Objective of the practice  Batik is a World Intangible Cultural Heritage, but the fabric used to create this textile art such as silk was too expensive for the low-income batik artists as they were mostly imported from overseas. Hence, endangering the art of Batik making as less people in the region can afford to create this art. They are abundantly found in specific-regions in Indonesia. However, in Indonesia, the larvae were subjected to control as agricultural pests. When viewed from a different perspective and by applying suitable technology and knowledge, pests can be transformed into a sustainable beneficial material that occur in large quantities. In this good practice, applicable Japanese biodiversity knowledge and collaboration with the Kimono market has significantly proven to improve the profitability of low-income earners, with an impact of greening the devastated 60 hectare land that belongs to the Royal Family of Jogjakarta.  Implementation of the Project  The Royal Silk Foundation has continuously created seminars to educate the villagers on how to turn the Cricula's cocoon into wild silk yarns and other handicrafts. This creates jobs and income for the local villagers as the yarns are exported to Japan to be used to create high value, Kimono and Obis. The business partners who purchase the wild silk yarns helped restore the Cricula's natural habitat by planting cashews, avocados etc. Tree planting tours are also actively conducted.  Impacts  Today the Royal hill is a green sanctuary and home to the Cricula Trifenestrata. Farmers understand that pests can be beneficial insects by changing their perspectives. The village has evolved into a sustainable village, with higher income and creativity in utilizing their local resources. The village is now popular as a cashew nuts and chips producer. There are inspection trip from overseas about the efforts of this successful project. There is a request from overseas for cooperation on this initiative.

Background Originating in Reims, Biscuit rose de Reims is a product of the Biscuits Fossier company. It is customary to dip the biscuit in champagne or red wine. The biscuit was created around 1690 in Reims. A baker wanted to make the most of the heat in the bread oven between the two batches, so he had the idea of creating a special dough; cooking it twice, which is where the name \\"biscuit\\" or \\"bis-cuit\\" meaning \\"cooked twice\\" in French. The biscuit initially was white. In order to add flavor to it, a pod of vanilla was introduced into the recipe. This vanilla left brown traces on the biscuit. In order to hide them, the baker decided to add a natural color based on cochineal, a scarlet dye, to disguise his mistake. From this sequence of events, the Biscuit Rose de Reims was born. The biscuit is oblong in shape, and is lightly sprinkled with caster sugar. Enthusiasts for the biscuit included King Charles X, Leopold II of Belgium, the Russian czar, and the Marquise de Polignac. It is commonly dipped in the following liquids to bring out its flavor: * Champagne * Ratafia * Coffee * Lemonade * Milk It quickly became a great success in terms of confectionery throughout France. The original recipe of the famous \\"Biscuit Rose\\" is still kept secretly by Fossier's confectioners. Despite the basic ingredients that include eggs, sugar, flour, and vanilla, the traditional French recipe demands special mastery and daintiness.

It was built between 1841 and 1843 in Saint-Denis at the direction of French prime minister Adolphe Thiers, and was part of an immense defensive belt comprising 17 detached forts and the Thiers Wall surrounding Paris. The evolution of artillery quickly made these fortifications obsolete. The fort is still used by the French Army. Units associated with the fort include a number of reserve units and the headquarters of the National Association of Reserve Warrant Officers. French Foreign Legion units associated with Operation Vigipirate are also stationed at Fort de l'Est. The northeast bastion of the formerly four-sided fort was removed to make way for the A1 autoroute, from which the fort is visible, and faces the Lyc√©e Suger secondary school, built in 1994. The military files concerning military insubordinations of World War I in the French Army are preserved there, as well as some unclassified files from the library of the former garrison. The glacis of the fort is partly occupied by community gardens.  Significant events  In 1870 the French forces at the Fort de l'Est fired on Stains, which was occupied by the Prussians, damaging a church and demolishing the chateau. Prussians eventually occupied the fort. In 1872 the fort's chaplain, Jules Bonhomme, published a popular memoir featuring the fort. On August 25, 1944, German army occupation forces evacuated the fort. In 1958 the inter-army office for standardization of materials (BICM) was installed at Fort de l'Est after France's ratification in 1956 of NATO standardization policies. During the Algerian War in 1962, a military tribunal held hearings at the Fort d l'Est in which Jean Bastien- Thiry was judged guilty of attempting to assassinate President Charles de Gaulle and condemned to death. He was executed at the Fort d'Ivry. Almost one hundred officers were held at Fort de l'Est. Between 2002 and 2004 the Salvation Army operated a 150-bed winter shelter within the fort, assisting 18,000 persons in 2002. In 2009 a village of temporary houses was placed on the site to accommodate about twenty Romani families moved from the \\"Andr√©- Campra\\" shantytown in La Plaine.

Background Axis-held territory at the end of the war in Europe shown in blue. At the beginning of May 1945 Nazi Germany was collapsing under the Allied onslaught. The Soviets had captured Berlin, and on 30 April Hitler had committed suicide. He had appointed Grand Admiral Karl D√∂nitz as Head of State and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. US Forces from the west and Soviet forces from the east had already met at Torgau, cutting the Reich in two, while in the north 21st Army Group was poised to capture Hamburg and the other German ports. The state of the German navy, the Kriegsmarine, was no better. Of its capital ships only survived, sheltering at Copenhagen; only the U-Boat Arm was capable of continuing the fight. The Kriegsmarine had approximately 470 U-boats remaining. Some 170 of these were operational U-boats (Front boats), based mainly in occupied Norway, and another 200 home- based boats in various stages of building, commissioning and working up; these were mainly in the north German ports and on the Baltic. As head of the Kriegsmarine, and as commander of the U-boat arm, D√∂nitz was committed that his U-boat force should not be surrendered. However, as the new German leader, he was keen to extricate Germany from the war and, if possible, avoid Allied, particularly Soviet, retribution. To that end he had opened negotiations with the western Allies, through Field Marshal Montgomery commander of Allied 21 Army Group, in North Germany. As the Allies closed in on the North German ports the Kriegsmarine started to destroy what was left to prevent its capture, while all serviceable boats were ordered to bases in Norway. During May a final massacre of U-boats fleeing to Norway took place; 23 U-boats were destroyed or damaged beyond repair in transit in the first week of May. Against this backdrop, D√∂nitz and the U-boat arm made plans for a mass scuttle of his U-boats, to be carried out on receiving the code-word \\"Regenbogen\\". The Operation During May the Kriegsmarine started to scuttle its U-boats ahead of the advancing Allied armies. On 1 May 1945, 3 U-boats were wrecked at Warnem√ºnde, outside Rostock on the Baltic coast, the first of a wave of scuttling boats and destroying facilities. On 2 May, a further 32 U-boats were scuttled at Travem√ºnde, near L√ºbeck. On 3 May, D√∂nitz sent his chief aide von Friedeburg to Montgomery at L√ºneburg to open negotiations for an armistice with the western allies. This was refused, as von Friedeburg was not empowered to agree to an unconditional surrender, upon which the Allies insisted. Also on 3 May another 39 boats were wrecked, 32 at Kiel and another 7 at Hamburg, on the North Sea coast. On 4 May the Supreme Allied Commander, Eisenhower allowed the German forces in Northwest Europe, including naval forces, to surrender to Montgomery and 21 Group; for this, Montgomery insisted that German naval forces, including the U-Boat arm, be surrendered intact. This would come into effect at 8 am on 5 May. Meanwhile, on 4 May, four more boats, two in the Kiel Canal and two at Flensburg, were scuttled. In the early hours of 5 May, the Regenbogen order was given, only to be countermanded 8 minutes later, to avoid jeopardizing the surrender negotiations, and later that day all operational U-boats were ordered to cease hostilities. Despite this a further 87 boats were destroyed on 5 May; 64 on the Baltic (41 at Gelting Bay, 13 at Flensburg and 10 at various other points), while on the North Sea coast 23 boats were disposed of, 13 at Wilhelmshaven and 10 in the Weser estuary. On 6 May, there were no further sinkings, but on 7 May the two Walter boats were wrecked at Cuxhaven. Over the last week at least 195 U-boats had been scuttled. On 8 May, Germany surrendered unconditionally; the remaining naval units, including the surviving U-boats, surrendered to Allied forces. At least 150 U-boats were surrendered to the Allied navies, either at sea or at their operational bases. 52 boats were surrendered at sea, either on patrol or in transit, and 98 in port, mostly in Norway and at bases in Germany, Denmark and France. Two U-boats ( and ) fled to Portuguese waters, where they were scuttled by their crews, the former off Porto and the later some miles from Nazar√©. Two others ( and ) and their crews arrived in Mar del Plata, Argentina, where they surrendered to the local authorities. Conclusion Various figures are given for the numbers of U-boats involved during this period; Kemp gives 218 scuttled, and 154 surrendered; Tarrant gives the same. Blair gives 222 scuttled and 174 surrendered. Neistle lists 195 scuttled and 150 surrendered. A number of U-boats disposed of were not in commission; some had not yet been commissioned, some had been decommissioned. The discrepancies are mainly accounted for depending on whether these are included or not. Most sourcesKemp, Roskill, Tarrant give a number of U‚Äìboats scuttled at the end of the war, and describe the Regenbogen order, conflating the two. Kemp describes the scuttle as an act of defiance, and quotes \\"Ali\\" Cremer's order to scuttle rather than surrender her. It is questionable, however, to what extent the effect the order had, or even if it was given at all. To take Cremer's case in point, Neistle lists U-2519 as being scuttled on 3 May at Kiel, before the surrender negotiations were complete, and at least 24 hours before the Regenbogen order was given. Dan van der Vat states the order was given at 1:34 am on 5 May, but countermanded eight minutes later by D√∂nitz. Blair on the other hand describes the order as being given \\"according to some sources\\", and queries \\"whether it was true or not\\", but believes some \\"ambiguous orders of some kind\\" were issued. But he also states the scuttle began on 5 May, while Neistle is clear it started 4 days earlier, at beginning of the month. Certainly by 1 am on 5 May at least 76 boats had already been wrecked, about half the total. On 5 May, and subsequently, another 89 were wrecked/scuttled, all in North German ports. Neistle gives the total of U-boats scuttled as 195, of which half were destroyed before, and half after, the Regenbogen order was given. Of the boats destroyed, most (184) were non-operational \\"Home\\" boats in North German ports. 11 were Front boats, and these include those fatally damaged in the May massacre and subsequently scuttled by their crews. On 8 May 1945, the surviving U-boats were surrendered to the Allied navies, either at sea or at their operational bases in Norway and on the North Sea coast, ending the Kriegsmarines war at sea.

Related, though broader, terms include \\"lifestyle balance\\" and \\"life balance\\". United States history= Agricultural work: 1800‚Äì1850  The first enforceable hours' law in the United States was in 1874 when Massachusetts enacted a law which limited the amount of time that women and children could work each week. This limit was set at sixty hours per week. Similar laws were later adopted by about half of the country's states. Only men in exceptionally hazardous jobs were covered in early legislation and most had no limit to the number of hours their employees could have them work. Ten-hour workdays were accepted in the agriculture industry during certain seasons and six-day workweeks were not unheard of. Bakers did not win the right to work less than ten hours per day until 1905 with the court case of Lochner v. New York. The general presumption during this period was that the courts would allow regulation of labor concerning women and children, who were thought to be incapable of bargaining on an equal footing with employers and in special need of protection. Men were allowed freedom of contract unless it could be proven that regulating their hours served a higher good for the population at large.  Industrial work-life: 1850s‚Äì1970  During the turn of the twentieth century, the push for an eight-hour workday was geared primarily toward raising the hourly wage. The idea was that by maintaining the current weekly pay while lowering working hours, a fairer rate of pay would result. The slogan, \\"Whether you work by the piece or work by the day, decreasing the hours increases the pay,\\" seemed to carry the mood of the day. The early twentieth century laid the groundwork for the idea of work-life balance. Advancements in social sciences would move the focus towards the impact of long hours on the physical and mental health of the employee. At this time, however, the new information was used to enhance productivity for the company. The shorter hours movement began to focus on the fact that an overworked employee is more prone to injury or mistake and becomes less productive. Josephine Goldmark wrote a book in 1912 detailing this fact and the Federal Public Works Act was passed the same year. This new act required a 40-hour workweek for employees of government contracted firms. Over the next ten years, the government passed legislation requiring a 40-hour work week for individual industries nearly every time the issue arose in court. When the employees of the steel industry failed to obtain a reduction from their 84-hour work week in 1919, the industry soon allowed their employees an eight- hour workday, a four-hour-per-day reduction‚Äîa move brought about by much \\"arm- twisting\\" on the part of President Harding. By the 1920s, the average work week was fifty hours and was considered a great stride and well-earned award for America's working man. (Whaples) The push for fewer hours had come to a close, but they had one more hurdle to overcome. The new concentration was on the ability to work half a day on Saturdays or have the day off completely. The ability to have two days of rest was unprecedented but was considered vital to finalize an ethical work schedule. Pressure was put on businesses to make the change, especially in industries and cities with a large number of Jewish workers (Jewish Sabbath is on Saturday), and they finally achieved this goal by the end of the decade. Where only thirty-two firms had a five-day workweek in 1920, nearly half had adopted the practice by 1927. Their success was short-lived. In the 1920s, the workers were coaxed into believing that they wanted to work longer hours and that they would be harmed by measures that limited how many hours they were allowed to work. Social scientists would later name this force the \\"gospel of consumption.\\" Beginning in the 1920s, advertisers persuaded Americans that happiness would not come from leisure time, but from purchasing commodities, and he concluded that this made it easier for managers to \\"allow\\" workers to make more money by working longer hours. Social scientists would conclude that a new work ethic began as Americans left the psychology of scarcity and adopted one of abundance. Some argue that this mentality of consumption or \\"consumerism\\" persists to this day. During the twentieth century, the average workweek has changed drastically. In 1900, the average workweek in manufacturing was approximately fifty-three hours. However, the workweek is responsive to business conditions. During the Great Depression, the average number of hours for production workers in manufacturing dropped to 34.6 each week. During World War II, hours worked rose to forty-five each week. The normal range of hours worked during the four decades after World War II was thirty-nine to forty-one hours (Whaples); however, starting in the 1990s, factory workweek hours began to exceed forty-one hours. As previously mentioned, Americans work approximately 47.1 hours each week; some employees work up to seventy hours. Therefore, it is safe to state that the average number of hours Americans presently work each week is the highest it has been in nearly seventy-five years. In 1900, only nineteen percent of women of working age were in the labor force. In 1999 sixty percent of women worked outside the home. Even if the hours worked were slightly higher at the turn of the century, most households were supported by one paycheck. \\"In 1900, eighty percent of American children had a working father and a stay-at-home mother; however, by 1999, that figure was only twenty-four percent.\\" During the Great Depression, working hours were reduced. By 1932, approximately fifty percent of Americans were working a shortened work week. Instead of reducing wages, employers decided to lay off many workers and attempted to protect the employees that remained by encouraging them to job share. President Herbert Hoover's Commission for Work Sharing pushed voluntary hours reductions, and it is estimated that nearly three to five million jobs had been saved. (Whaples) Companies such as Sears, General Motors, and Standard Oil reduced the number of days worked each week, and Akron began a six-hour workday. The AFL began to call for a federally mandated 30-hour workweek. By 1933, some experts were predicting that the \\"thirty-hour workweek was within a month of becoming federal law.\\" Congress began hearings on mandating the 30-hour workweek, and the Senate even passed the bill (which was written by Hugo Black and sponsored in the House by William Connery) fifty-three to thirty. Newly elected President, Franklin Roosevelt initially supported the bill, but had second thoughts when he realized that the bill had a provision to forbid importation of goods produced by workers who worked longer than thirty hours a week. Instead, Roosevelt began to support the National Industrial Recovery Act. Labor leaders were encouraged to support the NIRA instead of the Black-Connery Thirty-Hour Bill with a guarantee of union organization and collective bargaining. With the threat of a mandated 30-hour work week, businesses \\"fell into line.\\" When specifics codes for the NIRA were drawn up, shorter hours were no longer a genuine concern. After the Great Depression ended, the average weekly hours worked began to rise. (According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1934 the average hours worked each week was approximately thirty-four hours). During World War II, hours increased by approximately ten hours a week but, in the aftermath of the war, weekly work hours averaged forty hours.  Informational work‚Äìlife: 1970‚Äìpresent  With automation of the workplace in \\"full swing\\" by the 1970s, large numbers of women began entering the work force and an \\"awareness of stress rose to the forefront\\". In the publication Type A Behavior and Your Heart, cardiologists Meyer Friedman and Ray H. Rosenman wrote about the \\"hurry sickness\\" common to \\"workaholics\\"‚Äîpeople who had no friends and who \\"never relaxed or went to museums\\". In the late 1970s, Professor Robert Karasek of the University of Lowell (now known as University of Massachusetts Lowell) developed a method for analyzing stress-producing factors in the workplace. It has been widely employed to examine workplace pressures and their relationship with research data on coronary heart disease, musculoskeletal illnesses, psychological strain and absenteeism. Karasek explains, \\"In situations where an individual has high demands on him and low control, the undesirable stress of work and other situations becomes problematic.\\" The 1980s brought new complaints of work-life balance related stress. This time period was given such names as \\"the ME generation,\\" \\"the age of narcissism\\" and \\"the pursuit of loneliness.\\" The number of cases of emotional depression in the United States was believed to have doubled between 1970 and 1990. \\"What you do is what you are\\" was the common and unhealthy assumption. According to 'The Workaholic Syndrome', written by Judith K. Sprankle and Henry Ebel, \\"By their sheer numbers and the consequently narrowing opportunities at every upward run of the organizational ladder, the baby-boomers have been compelled to do more, to move faster, to compete harder. They, in turn, have set the pace for other age groups. The signs of increased stress are legion and have been intensified by an economic climate that mandates that if we marry at all, we marry a working spouse.\\" In the late 1980s, the \\"computer revolution\\" was not only responsible for corporate downsizing, but also increased the demand of employee output. Social critic Jeremy Rifkin states, \\"Back in the agriculture-based society, people were more attuned to generatively, and middle-stress disorders and diseases of affluence were not part of life. They weren't triggered until the Industrial Age, and now the Information Age has worsened them. Nowadays, instead of seconds, it's nanoseconds. We have moved from designing a schedule that real people can execute in whatever time it takes them, to a program which people can monitor but can't affect.\\" In the 1980s, the number of workers' compensation claims for \\"gradual mental stress\\" began to rise. Claims rose from 1,844 cases in 1981 to 15,688 in 1999 in the state of California alone. Because of the large number of cases as well as evidence of numerous cases of fraud, efforts were made in the early 1990s to reform the workers compensation program. Led by Republican Governor of California Pete Wilson and Democratic Party State assembly Speaker Willie Brown, the new law stated that claimants had to prove that stress was at least 51 percent of the reason for their illness. Unfortunately, because of these reforms some feel that it is now extremely difficult to be approved for workers compensation. John Burton, dean of the school of management and labor relations at Rutgers University feels that part of the reason for the decline is that \\"a number of states made it difficult to get stress into the system. So even if the stress is out there, it's not showing up (in the compensation statistics). Some of it shows up in the rising violence, which is a crude proxy for the stress out there.\\" American laws and policies regarding labor=Family and Medical Leave Act The 1990s saw the introduction of additional laws designed to help the American worker. One current law that guarantees employees time off is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 signed under U.S. President Bill Clinton. According to the Family and Medical Leave Act, any \\"eligible\\" employee is entitled to twelve weeks of leave for immediate family member need and medical reasons during a twelve-month period. An employee's spouse, children, and parents are considered immediate family. The term \\"parent\\" does not include an employee's in-laws or children over the age of eighteen unless they are \\"incapable of self-care\\" because of mental or physical disability that limits one or more of the \\"major life activities.\\" Employees are eligible to take FMLA leave if they have worked for their employer for at least twelve months, have worked at least 1,250 hours during the previous twelve months, and have worked at a company with a minimum of fifty employees that work either at that work site or at work sites within a seventy-five mile radius. Employers may select one of four options for determining the required twelve-month period. They can decide to determine eligibility by the calendar year, by any fixed twelve-month \\"leave year\\" such as a fiscal year, a year required by state law, or a year starting on the employee's \\"anniversary\\" date, by the twelve-month period measured forward from the date when an employee's first FMLA leave begins, or by a \\"rolling\\" twelve-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses FMLA leave. Pregnancy disability leave or maternity leave for the birth of a child would be considered qualifying FMLA leave. This law, however, does not guarantee paid time off; the FMLA only requires unpaid leave. However, the law permits an employee to elect, or the employer to require the employee, to use accrued paid leave, such as vacation or sick leave, for some or all of the FMLA leave period. It is unlawful for any employer to deny the right of any eligible employee the use of FMLA leave. Small Necessities Leave Act In addition to the Family Leave and Medical Act, there are many other federal and state statutes that allow employees legal time off from work. Massachusetts enacted the Small Necessities Leave Act in 1998 which expanded upon the rights guaranteed by the FMLA. The Small Necessities Leave Act allows eligible employees a total of twenty-four hours of unpaid leave during any twelve-month period, \\"over and above\\" the leave granted by the FMLA. This act allows an employee to participate in school activities directly related to the \\"educational advancement\\" of his/her child. This includes parent-teacher conferences, \\"back to school\\" activities, and even interviewing for a new school. The term \\"school\\" includes any public or private elementary or secondary schools, Head Start programs, and licensed children's day care centers. (Gallitano) The SNLA also allows employees to attend routine medical or dental appointments with their children. In addition, the employee is allowed to accompany an \\"elderly relative\\" to medical or dental appointments or any other services that provide professional services related to elder care. (The elderly relative must be at least sixty years old and be related by blood or marriage to the employee) The SNLA includes time off to arrange for professional care at a nursing home or rehabilitation facility. The eligibility required for leave under the Small Necessities Leave Act is the same as for eligibility under the Family and Medical Leave Act and, like the FMLA, the employer is permitted to choose the method for determining which twelve-month period will apply when calculating the twenty-four hours of leave that may be taken by the employee. Leaves of absences can be taken intermittently. For example, if the employee needs to take off two hours in the morning to attend a parent-teacher conference, the employer may not require the employee to take time off in blocks of half or full days. Also, the employer is given the option of requesting certification (from a physician or school, for example) for leave requests. Massachusetts Maternity Leave Statute Massachusetts created the Massachusetts Maternity Leave Statute in 1972. This law provides eight weeks of leave to female employees who have met certain criteria. This statute applies to all employers having six or more employees. Those eligible under the Massachusetts statute must be full-time employees who have completed three months of work. It also applies when an eligible female adopts a child under eighteen years old (or under twenty-three if the child is mentally or physically disabled). The employer can decide if this leave will be paid or unpaid. If the leave is unpaid, the employer must permit the employee to use accrued paid sick, vacation, or personal time, but the employer may not require the employee to use that accrued time. Wage and Hour Law and \\"Day of Rest\\" Statute Massachusetts also has a statute, known as the Wage and Hour Law, which creates a number of additional rights for employees regarding time off. Massachusetts law requires employers to provide a thirty-minute meal break to every employee who works more than six hours a day; it does not require that the meal break be paid. Another form of time off from work that is governed by the statute is the creation of \\"legal holidays.\\" Massachusetts law presently includes eleven legal holidays. If employees are required to work on a legal holiday (such as retail employees) they must be paid at a rate of one and a half times their normal pay rate. Massachusetts also has a \\"Day of Rest\\" statute that provides that all employees are entitled to one day off from work in seven calendar days. Short- and long-term disability Many employers offer short and /or long-term disability insurance to their employees. These plans offer wage replacement benefits for employees who are not able to work based on a physical or mental condition. There are no laws requiring an employer to grant paid vacations to its employees in Massachusetts. However, nearly all employers provide paid vacation benefits in some form in order to remain competitive. Exemption status Besides the different compensation structures between exempt and nonexempt workers (for example, exempt employees are excluded from minimum wage and are paid a salary rather than minimum wage; whereas, nonexempt employees must be paid at least the federal minimum wage for each hour worked), there are differences in overtime requirements and expectations. Exempt employees are usually expected to work the number of hours necessary to complete their tasks, regardless of whether that requires thirty-five or fifty-five hours per week. On the other hand, nonexempt employees must be paid overtime if they work more than forty hours per week. If an exempt employee's \\"tasks\\" are extensive and time-consuming, he/she is required to put in an indeterminable number of hours at the workplace. If staying late or coming in early is required to do the job, exempt employees are frequently expected to do just that. This could cut down on the amount of time he/she has for family, friends, or leisure activities, increase stress, and could even lead to Occupational Burnout.  Global comparisons  Work- life balance has been a controversial issue for workers across the United States for decades. Long work hours are based partly on some business's long operating schedules, while many European countries do not. According to the OECD Better Life Index the United States ranked 28th in work-life balance while European nations dominate this category. Countries adopt welfare state, which determines the role the government takes to preserve the well being of the citizen. The United States developed a limited welfare state in 1930. Denmark, Sweden and Norway are ranked in the top 10 countries with the best work‚Äìlife balance and have all adopted the Social-Democratic Welfare State Regime. This system promotes many appealing benefits for single men, women and families. In Denmark new parents are guaranteed 52 weeks of paid leave and universal childcare facilities. Sweden also has an attractive parental leave insuring workers 480 days of paid parental leave. For the Swedish long work hours have been replaced with 6-hour workdays with 1% of the population working more than 50 hours a week. Other countries like Spain, Germany and the Netherlands are leading in successful work-life balance by adopting the Mediterranean and Conservative Regimes. Within this welfare state there's a focus on traditional family values and gender norm. According to Dr. Deirdre Anderson of Cranfield School of Management \\"women's place in the labor market is fairly low\\" compared to the United States, which allows time for family and additional source of income. In Spain gender norms have created the availability of part-time jobs that are typically \\"employed\\" by women. The Netherlands follows the same approach on part-time employment as Spain and has \\"more than half of the working population work part time\\". Another benefit of work-life balance within this welfare state is the approach on vacation days. Germans are required by law to have 20 paid days off a year and their Dutch counterparts also are insured 20 vacation days. The common factor between the nations that have prosperous work-life balance is flexible working hours, parental leave and child care policies.  Gender and work‚Äìlife balance  A study conducted in 2009 concluded that 39% of working women and 45% of working men experience issues with work-life balance. Full-time male employees worked an average of 8.4 hours per day in 2014, compared with the 7.8 hours worked by women. But nearly 8 million more women than men worked part-time last year. 2013 and 2014 states that 57 percent of women participated in the labor force. Since 1975, the rate of working mothers has risen from 47.4 percent to 70.3 percent. Women became more prominent in the professional workforce during the 1970s even after getting married and having children. Today women make up 47 percent of the labor force, compared to 38 percent in 1970. Mothers entering the workforce was a shift in traditional values for women and mothers, however in the 2010s, 70% of high school students surveyed believed that mothers could have a healthy relationship with their mother, as opposed to 53% in the 1970s. Studies show the paid family leave and paid sick days are the issues women care about over any other work-life policy issue. In a poll conducted in November 2008, 35% of women felt that issues in work-life balance for women would be best addressed through paid family leave and sick days. Both genders actually feel that these concerns better address work-life balance with growing concerns of watching children, older family members, and ill family members.

Name In some documents he is known as Cinzio Personeni Aldobrandini or Cinzio Passeri Aldobrandini because, after settling in Romagna, the family varied its name according to the place from which they had moved - his father Aurelio Personeni was born in C√† Personeni (frazione of Bedulita in the province of Bergamo) and later Aurelio's family moved to C√† Passero (frazione of Berbenno in the province of Bergamo); as a merchant, Aurelio moved to Senigallia, where he married. The latin inscription on his tomb monument identifies him simply as \\"CINTHIO ALDOBRANDINO\\". Life Tomb in the church San Pietro in Vincoli, Rome Cinzio was born in Senigallia, a son of Aurelio Personeni and Giulia Aldobrandini, the latter being sister to cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini (later Pope Clement VIII). In 1565 Cinzio began his studies in letters and law at Ippolito's household in Rome. Attending Rome's Collegio Germanico, the university of Perugia and the university of Padua, he graduated as a doctor of law at Padua. Cinzio accompanied Ippolito on the legation to bring an end to the war between Poland and Germany and in 1588 was back in Rome to bring news of the legation's success to pope Sixtus V. On 17 September 1593 the consistory named Cinzio a cardinal deacon of San Giorgio al Velabro with dispensation thanks to Ippolito's intercession to the College of Cardinals. Governor of Spoleto from 4 February 1595 until 21 February 1607, Cinzio then became prefect of the Tribunale della Segnatura Apostolica from 23 December 1599. From 1601 to 1607 he was papal legate to Avignon and he participated in the March‚ÄìApril and May 1605 conclaves. In 1605 he was made Major Penitentiary by pope Leo XI but suddenly resigned that office because he had still not been ordained priest - he was ordained priest later in 1605 and re-assumed the office. He was then given the titulus of San Pietro in Vincoli on 1 June 1605. He was known for his generosity to the poor and to the arts and letters, as well as being a friend of Torquato Tasso (for some years in the papal service). Cinzio died in Rome in 1610 and was buried at San Pietro in Vincoli where nearly a century later (1705-07) prince Giovanni Battista Pamphili Aldobrandini erected a monument to him, designed by the architect Carlo Francesco Bizzaccheri and with sculptures by Pierre Le Gros the Younger.

The Erean Mountains () are a mountain chain in central Sicily, southern Italy, mostly located in the central and northern areas of the province of Enna. The highest peak is the Monte Altesina, at 1,192 m above sea level. Description The Erean Mountains are of limestone origin, and do not reach high altitudes. Their area was once one of the most important in the world for the production of sulphur, as testified today by numerous mineral quarries, the largest being that of Floristella-Grottacalda. There are several lakes in the mountain group, such as Pergusa Lake, whose rich bird life has given it the status of being the first special Natural Reserve in Sicily, and Pozzillo Lake, the largest artificial basin on the island. Due to the rugged landscape, the population totals less than 200,000 and thus the area's population density is lower. The chain is home to the largest Italian city above 900 m altitude (and the largest provincial capital in Europe at that altitude as well), Enna, which is home more or less to one-sixth of the whole Erean population. The mountain chain is crossed by a motorway, A19 Palermo-Catania, and by a railroad running in the same direction. Most of the remaining roads wind and curve extensively through the terrain due to its rugged and geologically unstable nature.

Along with Annabel Morris Buchanan, he helped found the White Top Folk Festival, which promoted music of the people in the Appalachian Mountains. A firm believer in segregation and white supremacy, Powell also helped found the Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America, which soon had numerous posts in Virginia. He contributed to the drafting and passage of the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which institutionalized the one-drop rule by classifying as black (colored) anyone with African ancestry. Early life and education Powell was born and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. He graduated from the University of Virginia in 1901, and studied piano with Theodor Leschetizky and composition in Vienna with composer Karel Navr√°til. He made his debut as a concert pianist in 1908 in Berlin. Music career Powell became a world-renowned composer. He had a racialist approach to music, which he expressed in his writings. He was interested in Appalachian folk music and championed its performance and preservation. He was one of the founders of the White Top Folk Festival, held in Grayson County, Virginia annually from 1931 to 1939.Whisnant (1983) Political activism Powell's ideology‚Äîand musicology‚Äîwere strongly racialist and anti-black, a topic which served as the subject for many of his essays.Kushner (1986) In the fall of 1922 together with Earnest Sevier Cox (a self-proclaimed ethnologist and explorer) and Dr. Walter Plecker, Powell founded the Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America in Richmond, Virginia.Smith (2002) They worked closely with Walter Ashby Plecker to promote state legislation to classify people simply as \\"white\\" or \\"negro\\", and to end \\"amalgamation\\" of the races by intermarriage. The activities of the club split the elite in Virginia, which had tried to take pride in its \\"genteel paternalism\\" in controlling racial relations. The clubs attracted more racists. Within a year, more than 400 white men had joined as members and the club had 31 \\"posts\\" in Virginia, including two in Charlottesville, one for the town and one at the University of Virginia. Powell worked with Dr. Plecker, the state's registrar of statistics, to draft the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. The club members were successful in lobbying the legislature to gain passage of the act, which classified as black any person with any African ancestry, although the previous law recognized persons with one-sixteenth or less black ancestry as white.Whisnant 1983, pp. 240-242.

Death and legacy Powell died in Albemarle County, Virginia near Charlottesville, and was buried at Hollywood cemetery in Richmond. Radford University named its arts and music hall after Powell, honoring his championing of Appalachian music. However, in 2005, Prof. Richard Straw's Appalachian Studies class at the university discovered Powell's role in white supremacy and brought it to the attention of administrators. The school developed a plan to rename the hall, but did not implement it at the time. In 2010, Christian Trejbal, a columnist for The Roanoke Times, contacted the university about why the hall had not been renamed, prompting officials to take up the issue again. The University Board of Visitors voted to remove Powell's name, merging the hall with Porterfield Hall, to which it was already physically connected.Tonia Moxley, \\"White supremacist's name removed from RU building\\", The Roanoke Times, 18 September 2010, accessed 26 August 2011 External links * *Papers of John Powell at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia References ;Notes ;Sources * Kushner, David Z.

The album was made available for official download on bleep.com and the Japanese iTunes Store on 22 February 2010; the CD and deluxe vinyl editions were released on 22 March 2010. Critics were generally quite positive about Oversteps, with many considering it more focused and accessible than previous albums. A few months after its release, Oversteps was followed by a companion EP entitled Move of Ten. Background and production In a March 2010 interview with Clash, Autechre members Sean Booth and Rob Brown said they did not know if any other music influenced the development of Oversteps; Booth commented that \\"I don‚Äôt own a single record that sounds like 'Oversteps'\\". The dynamic between the duo in the studio was called \\"hilariously accommodating\\" in the same interview, with Booth stating \\"I don‚Äôt mind backing down\\". Autechre streamed a twelve-hour webcast in early March 2010, coinciding with the album's release, as they had with the releases of Untilted and Quaristice. The album artwork was created by The Designers Republic. In an interview with Warp Records, Ian Anderson of tDR explained that the album's artwork was based on a life-long influence of Anderson's, that of man versus machine. The cover is based on the idea that \\"[people are] trying to be as effective as machines and do the tasks that we‚Äôve developed machines to do\\", and that a relatively simple task for a computer but an arduous one for a human is to draw a perfect circle. Anderson remarked that, in a March 2020 interview with Creative Boom editor Katy Cowan, while the duo described Oversteps as their \\"the most unhuman album\\" to date, he thought that their material was more organic than their other work by comparison. The artwork was created by staff at tDR who then attempted to create perfect circles by using a variety of materials and sizes. In all, seventy-two different circles were generated with paintbrushes and felt tip pens, making the covers of each format (CD, vinyl record, and in the case of digital, individual song artwork), print ad and merchandise a unique attempt at a perfectly drawn circle by a human. The concept would be applied to concentric rings forming circles for Autechre's follow-up EP, Move of Ten. Release Oversteps was released on 22 March 2010. Before its release, numerous fake versions of the album showed up on Internet websites, just as had happened with the previous three sets. Brown said it was \\"becoming a bit of a tradition\\" at the time of the album's release. Oversteps peaked at number 13 on the UK Official Charts Company's Independent Albums Chart. In the US, the album peaked at No. 15 and No. 46 on Billboards Dance/Electronic Albums and Heatseekers Albums charts, respectively, the week of 10 April 2010. Reception Oversteps received generally positive reviews, with most agreeing it is one of the band's most accessible albums to date. Matt Kennedy of BBC was highly complimentary, and noted that while \\"Oversteps is certainly no exception to their outwardly difficult aesthetic.... Beneath the icy exterior, deceptively warm hearts beat\\". He added that, as per usual, the album was not immediately accessible, but that repeatedly listening to it is \\"the only method of absorbing Oversteps‚Äô depths\\", concluding, \\"Autechre continue to test themselves and listeners alike with stunningly intricate results.\\" Paul Clarke of Drowned in Sound agreed, saying Oversteps \\"initially still seems as imposing as an abandoned warehouse surrounded by nine feet of razor wire\\", but \\"does have entry points for the casual listener\\". He compared it to mid-1990s sets by fellow IDM group Future Sound of London, saying the album's songs \\"all seem to blossom out of each other to immerse the listener in a synaesthetic environment.\\" He concluded his review on a similar note as Kennedy, saying, \\"Oversteps is still a challenging listen, and one which reveals endless layers of new detail with each spin. But it‚Äôs also their most instantly rewarding‚Äîand arguably best‚Äîalbum to date.\\" Patrick Sisson of Pitchfork Media said the album recalled earlier works such as Amber, saying, \\"the ambience and atmospheres of Oversteps are haunting.\\" He also called the album \\"less rigid\\" and \\"almost organic\\", concluding that Autechre were \\"still incorporating new designs, not merely repackaging the previous products.\\" Track listingReferencesExternal links * Official release announcement Category:Autechre albums Category:2010 albums Category:Warp (record label) albums Category:Albums with cover art by The Designer's Republic ","title":"Oversteps (album)"},{"id":"25792180","text":"Sir Nicholas Crispe, 1st Baronet (c. 1599 ‚Äì 26 February 1666 (O.S)) was an English Royalist and a wealthy merchant who pioneered the West African trade in the 1630s; a customs farmer (1640 and c. 1661-6); Member of Parliament for Winchelsea Nov. 1640-1 (being expelled as a monopolist); member of the Council of Trade (from 1660) and for Foreign Plantations (from 1661); and Gentleman of the Privy Chamber from 1664. He was knighted in 1640 or 1641 and was made a baronet in 1665. He died in February 1666 (O.S.) aged 67. Early life Little is known of his early life and even his name is variously spelled as Crisp or Crispe. He was the son of Ellis Crispe who was Sheriff of London and died in 1625. He was the brother of Tobias Crisp, a prominent cleric and antinomian. Crisp made money from brickworks in Hammersmith then invested in other trade. Crisp's main commercial interests were in the trades to India and Africa. Like his father he was a substantial stockholder in the East India Company, and throughout his twenties he imported a wide variety of commodities, including cloves, indigo, silks, pepper, elephant tusks, calicoes, and shells. The shells were specially purchased on his behalf by the company's agents and it is thought that they were used to finance the purchase of slaves in west Africa. Guinea Company The Company of Adventurers of London trading to the ports of Africa, or more commonly known as \\"The Guinea Company\\" was the first private company to colonize Africa for profit. They were a trading company primarily exporting redwood (used for dyes) from the western parts of Africa. Nicholas Crisp started investing in the company in 1625 and became the controlling stock holder in 1628. Nicholas Crisp got most of his royalist support through the building of trading forts on the Gold Coast of Komenda and Kormantin. The King, James I, saw them as a great value to future of England/Africa trade. It is estimated that Nicholas Crisp and his company made a profit of over ‚Ç§500,000 through the gold they had collected within the 11‚Äì12 years after 1632. According to British parliamentary records, the company also appears to have been involved in the trade of enslaved Africans.The Crispe Family and the African Trade in the Seventeenth Century R. Porter The Journal of African History, Vol. 9, No. 1 (1968), pp. 57-77 (article consists of 21 pages) Published by: Cambridge University Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/179920 A sizeable assemblage of early-17th century glass beads and ‚Äòwasters‚Äô were discovered in association with a brick furnace in the grounds of the private estate of Sir Nicholas Crisp (on what is now Hammersmith Embankment) during excavation in 2005. Crisp had a patent for making and vending beads and he also obtained a patent for slave trading from Guinea to the West Indies. These beads were probably used for both the local and colonial markets as researchers have uncovered similar beads in the Americas and in Ghana. This is the first clear archaeological evidence for the manufacture of early post-medieval glass beads in England. Elected to the Long Parliament in 1640 to represent Winchelsea he was expelled in 1641 for collecting duties on merchandise which he used as security to loan money to the cash-strapped King Charles I without the authorization of Parliament. On New Year's Day 1640, Charles knighted Crisp, recognising his past services, but perhaps more importantly, anticipating his further services. Civil War Despite his loyalties to the King, who had fled to Oxford on the outbreak of Civil War, Crisp remained in Roundhead-controlled London. However he was questioned by the House of Commons in January 1643 about ¬£3,700, which an intercepted letter revealed as owed to him ‚Äòfor secrett service done for his Majestie‚Äô. He promptly slipped away to Oxford, where he was warmly welcomed by the King, but his houses in Hammersmith and Lime Street were ransacked. Crisp was forced by Parliament to surrender his patents for making and vending beads and for slave trading from Guinea to the West Indies. An order relating to a debt owed by Sir Nicholas Crisp to the Navy was laid before the House of Lords in December 1643. The House of Commons of England had ordered that Crisp's share in the Guinea Company, his trading venture to Africa, should be used to cover this debt. The arrival of gold from this adventure now prompted the House of Lords to confirm that Crisp's share in this should be used to pay off the debt. Crisp ‚Äôs supported the King in a number of ways throughout the Civil War. He was at the centre of a plan in March 1643 to head a force to take over London, but the idea failed. A letter to him from Sir Thomas Ogle was intercepted and published. He was also frustrated in his attempts to raise an infantry regiment of 1,500 later that year. However, on 6 May 1644, he was commissioned to equip 15 warships at his own and his partner's expense and granted a tenth of any prizes taken by them. Operating from west country ports, he ferried troops from Ireland and played an important role in shipping tin and wool to the continent. He would also bring back arms and ammunition as a return cargo, and ultimately held the important position of deputy controller-general of posts. His allegiance to the crown was steadfast, even after Charles I was executed in 1649 and he was forced to flee to France like many others. Family connections allowed him to return but his politics had not changed in the least and in the run up to the Restoration, Crisp performed secret services and raised money for exiled Charles II. He was among those London Royalists who signed the declaration in support of General Monk to restore the Stuart monarchy. He was also involved in clandestine support for royalist conspiracies, such as the abortive plot of 1650 to land forces from the Scillies on the Cornish coast. In May 1660 Crisp was one of the committee sent to meet Charles II at Breda as he returned to England to take to the throne his father had vacated. Later life Once the monarchy was restored he was paid back in part for all he had lost defending the Crown. The King also appointed him to a number of prominent offices to make up the deficit. He tried to regain his former trading position, but was unsuccessful, though his membership in the Company of Adventurers did give him some influence on the trade. He was mentioned in Samuel Pepys' diary on 11 February 1660; 25 January, 15 and 19 February, 5 September 1662; and 22 August 1663. Pepys notes his inventiveness and mentions his proposals for a wet-dock. He was returned to Parliament again in 1661 to represent Winchelsea until 1666. In 1665 Charles II honoured his loyal servant by creating him a baronet. He died on 26 February 1666 (O.S.) aged 67. Legacy In his will he directed that his monument should record that he had lost ‚Äòout of purse about a Hundred Thousand pounds‚Äô by his pioneering efforts in the Guinea trade. He was buried in the church of St Mildred, Bread Street in east London, but: > \\"...he directed that his embalmed heart should be placed in an urn beneath a > bronze bust of Charles I which in his lifetime he had placed in the Church > where he had worshipped God ‚Ä¶ For a century and a half the heart was taken > out on the anniversary of its burial and refreshed with wine.

The memorial to Crisp was transferred to the newer church, which was built on the same site in 1883. On 18 June 1898, his remains and his heart were reunited in a chest tomb which stands in the churchyard of St Paul's by the north-east door of the church.

It contains the name of John Addison, Privy Councilor. His grandson Henry was rector of St. John's for thirty years. He was educated at Oxford, and in the corner of a quaint old portrait of him in the possession of the family is a scroll containing the picture of his college. His parish would have no other rector during his life. A later descendant, Walter Dulaney Addison, became rector in the year 1801. The old Bible and prayer book used by Rev.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 14, 2010. In the episode, Leslie (Amy Poehler) is set up on a blind date with an MRI technologist, played by Poehler's then-husband, comedic actor Will Arnett. The episode was directed by Troy Miller and written by Katie Dippold. In addition to Arnett's performance, \\"The Set Up\\" featured the first of several guest appearances by Justin Theroux, who portrayed a love interest for Leslie, and Ben Schwartz, who played Tom's fast-talking friend Jean-Ralphio. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"The Set Up\\" was seen by 4.59 million households, which was considered consistent with other second season episodes. \\"The Set Up\\" received generally positive reviews. Plot When Leslie (Amy Poehler) learns Pawnee is being sued by the previous owners of the lot where she is seeking to build a park, Ann (Rashida Jones) refers her to her lawyer friend Justin Anderson (Justin Theroux), who she calls \\"the greatest guy ever\\". Justin helps Leslie resolve the issue, and the two seem to get along very well together. Having recently broken up with her boyfriend, Leslie asks Ann to set her up on a date, but is surprised when Ann hesitates to set her up with Justin. Instead, she arranges a date with Chris (Will Arnett) an MRI technologist Ann works with. The date goes poorly, with Chris appearing annoyed upon learning Leslie attended a rival college, and that she was a director of regular parks, not amusement parks. When Leslie said she has never received an MRI, Chris takes her to the hospital to receive one. Chris makes uncomfortable comments, remarking that Leslie has an excellent uterus (\\"could easily have triplets right off the bat\\") and asking whether she is having her period, presumably in anticipation of sex later. Leslie rejects his advances when the date ends, prompting him to make an angry goodbye, even though Leslie still needs to give him a ride home. Meanwhile, Mark (Paul Schneider) grows suspicious that Ann harbors romantic feelings for Justin. He eventually confronts Ann and accuses her of trying to \\"save\\" Justin for a possible relationship in the future, and after Ann lamely half-denies this is true, Mark leaves their date night and annoyedly spoils the ending of the movie they'd planned to watch (Marley & Me). Mark asks Ann's ex-boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt), who also recalls Ann's infatuation with Justin and makes sure to tell Mark that Justin is a far better man than he is. Andy scolds Ann for hurting Mark's feelings, then tries to trick her into thinking she was still dating him, which does not work. Realizing her behavior was inappropriate, Ann sets Leslie up on a date with Justin. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) deals with complaints from local residents due to a new town policy requiring public officials to deal more directly to the public. Ron calls the policy \\"my hell\\", and seeks a new assistant to protect him from the citizens. Tom (Aziz Ansari) volunteers to find Ron an assistant, but during job interviews he asks questions about \\"real-world expertise\\", such as what tie he should wear to the club and what to text girls after a party. Tom brings forward a fast-talking candidate named Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz), whose personality closely resembles Tom's. Ron hates him right away. April (Aubrey Plaza) draws attention around the office for showing up late and slacking off at work. Bored with her internship, April insists she cannot wait to leave the parks department. However, after spending time with Andy at the town hall shoeshine stand where he works, April decides she wants to stay closer to him and volunteers to be Ron's assistant. She also convinces Andy to sell his band's CDs at the hall, which proves successful. When she slams the door on Tom while he tries to talk to them, Ron immediately hires her. Production alt=A black-haired man wearing a black fedora, a black leather jacket and a green T-shirt. \\"The Set Up\\" was directed by Troy Miller and written by Katie Dippold. It featured guest appearances by Will Arnett as MRI technologist Chris and Justin Theroux as Ann's lawyer friend Justin, Arnett was at the time the real-life husband of Amy Poehler, who plays protagonist Leslie Knope. It was not Poehler who arranged for him to be on the show, but rather Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur, who is a good friend of Arnett and felt he would be a good fit for the character. Their date scenes marked the second on-screen pairing between a Parks and Recreation actor and their real-life spouse; Megan Mullally, the wife of actor Nick Offerman, guest starred as Ron Swanson's ex-wife Tammy in the episode, \\"Ron and Tammy\\". Although Theroux was slated to make appearances in multiple Parks and Recreation episodes, Arnett was scheduled to appear only in \\"The Set Up\\". \\"The Set Up\\" also marked the first of several recurring appearances by Ben Schwartz as Tom's friend Jean- Ralphio Saperstein. Schur said the character was invented because the Parks and Recreation staff liked the actor and tried to find a way to work him into the show. Cultural references At the start of the episode, Leslie had a large framed photo of Dave Sanderson, the Pawnee police officer she had recently broken up with in the episode \\"Christmas Scandal\\". Sanderson was played by stand-up comedian Louis C.K. in several of Parks and Recreation episodes. When asked about her ideal man, Leslie said she wanted somebody with the brains of film star George Clooney and the body of Joe Biden, the 67-year- old Vice President of the United States. April said she was late for work because she had to finish watching the 2002 teenage horror-film Swimfan. Ann and Mark watch the 2008 comedy-drama film Marley & Me and the 2009 sci-fi action film District 9. Reception In its original American broadcast on January 14, 2010, \\"The Set Up\\" was seen by 4.59 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research. The viewership was considered consistent with other second season episodes. \\"The Set Up\\" drew a 2.1 rating/6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. The episode received generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez favorably compared the on-screen pairing of Poehler and Arnett to the comedic chemistry between Jennifer Aniston and her then-husband Brad Pitt when he guest-starred on the sitcom Friends. However, Gonzalez said the Poehler and Arnett scenes were \\"the best worst first date I‚Äôd seen on TV in a while\\". Gonzalez also said she continued to be bored by the subplots involving Ann and Mark. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club complimented \\"The Set Up\\" and said the characters played off each other well, but added the episode \\"felt a little too plot driven to ascend to A-material heights\\". Heisler particularly praised the performances of Chris Pratt and Will Arnett, who he said displayed a subtler sense of humor than in his role on the television series Arrested Development. TV Squad writer Kona Gallagher praised the episode, and said she was glad the writers found a reason to keep April in the show without keeping her on as an intern indefinitely. Gallagher also said the jealousy issue was handled well between Mark and Ann, giving the impression of true feelings between the characters. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger praised the decision of April becoming Ron's assistant because of the comedic potential of the duo. Sepinwall said although Theroux was charming and funny, Arnett \\"didn't quite fit into the show's low- key, naturalistic vibe\\". DVD release \\"The Set Up\\", along with the other 23 second season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010.

The operation culminated in the Battle of the Barents Sea. Background Following the hard-fought PQ 18 and the disastrous PQ 17 battles in the autumn and summer of 1942 the Allied supply convoys to the Soviet Union had been temporarily suspended. In December 1942 they started again with a new JW/RA convoy series. Against this possibility the had concentrated a large force of surface vessels and U-boats, supported by aircraft from the (German Air Force). German plan was based on a plan to intercept the next Allied convoy to Murmansk. A patrol line of four U-boats was established off Bear Island and a surface force consisting of cruisers Hipper, L√ºtzow and six destroyers was assembled at Altafjord. In the event of a convoy report the fleet would sail as two battle-groups; one to engage the expected cruiser escort and the other to attack the convoy. The German force was handicapped by strict orders from Adolf Hitler not to take excessive risks with the capital ships, which led to a general loss of aggression. was also hampered by an additional aim of sending L√ºtzow on into the Atlantic following the action, which also led to a reluctance to take risks. Action On 22 December 1942 Convoy JW 51B sailed for Murmansk and was detected by on 30 December and the German flotilla sailed from Altafjord the same day on an interception course. In the Battle of the Barents Sea, Regenbogen had some success; Hipper was able to draw off the escort as planned, allowing L√ºtzow to close with the convoy. Excessive caution by the captain of Lutzow caused him to break off the attack having caused little damage. Aftermath The failure of the operation can be attributed to the spirited defence made by the convoy escort and the restrictive and contradictory orders given by Hitler to the force commander. Hitler was furious when he heard about the dismal performance by the navy. He subjected Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, the head of the , to a 90-minute tirade, in which he berated the uselessness of the German surface fleet, and announced a decision to scrap all its ships and use its guns and men as shore defences. Raeder felt unable to continue without the confidence of his leader and offered his resignation, which was accepted. Raeder was replaced by Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, the commander of the U-boat fleet.

Synopsis The story starts in Melbourne, Australia with two women. Vicky is a beautiful tall Greek woman who works as a model and, despite her good looks, has little luck with men (her concern being that nobody looks beyond her appearance). She is friends with Stella, a short and overweight woman, who was born in Australia to Greek parents and works as a fashion designer at her own atelier. Stella and best friend and co-worker Toula, who is also overweight, have a big crush on Nikos Bezendakos, a Greek businessman whom they gaze every day out of the shop window while he is on his way to the gym. Meanwhile, Stella has developed an internet relationship with Grigoris, a fast-food employee in Greece. It is not long before Vicky (unaware of Stella's crush on Nikos) and Nikos meet, fall in love and get engaged and Stella decides to leave her dreams of Nikos behind and travel to Greece to meet Grigoris in person. At the same time Vicky also decides to travel to Greece to meet Nikos' family and make preparations for their wedding and rebooks her ticket on the same flight as Stella. While on a stopover in Bangkok Airport, Vicky is stressed at the idea of meeting Nikos' parents and comes up with an idea. She wants Stella and herself to switch places so that Stella will meet her future in-laws (to see what they're like) and so that she will meet Grigoris (in order to discover what he really thinks of Stella). Stella rejects her idea but Vicky puts her plan in action at Athens Airport, leaving Stella behind to meet her in-laws. From this moment on, Vicky becomes \\"Stella\\" and Stella becomes \\"Vicky\\", Nikos' fianc√©e. \\"Vicky\\" (Stella) immediately wants to tell the truth to Nikos' family (for fear of legal problems if her real identity is revealed), however she is unable to partly because Nikos' family becomes emotionally attached to her (and, being an orphan, doesn't want to upset them) and partly because she immediately falls in love with Sotiris, Nikos' rebellious younger brother. In the meantime, she has to deal with Vera and Lykourgos, Nikos' overprotective and caring parents (who adore their supposed future daughter-in-law), grandpa Nikos (who soon realizes that she is not really who she is supposed to be but doesn't give away her secret), Nikos' neurotic and overbearing sister Annetta (who greatly dislikes her) and Annetta's docile and submissive husband Panagiotis. Panagiotis, impressed by Stella's outgoing personality develops a secret crush on her and, due to a misunderstanding, she thinks that Sotiris is in love with her. Meanwhile, \\"Stella\\" (Vicky) falls in love with Grigoris (who loves her because of who she is and not because of her looks) but soon she feels guilt over what she has done to Nikos and she leaves Grigoris and Greece and goes back to Australia in order to be with her fianc√©. However, once she gets there she discovers that he is cheating on her and, furious, she goes back to Greece. Vicky gets back with Grigoris but after a while also reconciles with Nikos. When she finds out that Nikos intends to surprise her by an impromptu visit to Greece, she rushes to the airport and informs him of the switch. Nikos immediately dislikes Stella, holding her responsible for the entire plan and they soon stage a fight and \\"break up\\", with Stella leaving the house. Before she leaves for Australia, she confesses her love to Sotiris and he runs after her but is unable to stop her. Nikos' father, unaware of the switch and thinking that Nikos and \\"Vicky\\" (Stella) are just acting out, devises a plan to get them back together and pretends to be gravely ill to force them to reconcile and get married. Nikos travels to Australia to convince Stella to pretend they are back together and, moved by Lykourgos' \\"illness\\", she accepts and returns to Greece with Nikos (having become friends with him along the way) to prepare their mariage blanc. Soon, she and Sotiris consummate their relationship but he breaks it off since he believes Stella is the future wife of his brother. In the meantime, Grigoris lost track of Vicky for a few days and, thinking she went back to Australia, decided to go and search for her. However, once there he realizes that she was in Greece all along and worse still, when he returns to Greece she tells him the truth about who she is and, feeling guilty for the shock that she caused, breaks up with him so that he can rebuild his life. Having fallen in love with Grigoris and after they both realize that their relationship is not based on solid ground, Vicky and Nikos eventually break up while he prepares to marry Stella. One week before the wedding, Sotiris decides to go on a motorbike trip so that he won't be around to see Stella get married and Toula, finds him in the middle of the road and explains everything to him about the switch and the fact that the marriage is fake. The night before the wedding, having ended her friendship with Vicky (who believes that Stella wants to marry Nikos and that she planned for it all along) and having read Sotiris' journals and how deep in love he was with her, Stella decides to leave in the middle of the night and cancel her wedding with Nikos, revealing what her real name is amidst a teary farewell with some of the family members who are awake. As soon as she leaves the house, she finds Sotiris waiting for her and the series ends with the couple going on a motorbike trip together.

Its primary mission was observation aircraft training and antisubmarine patrols. The group moved to several different U.S. locations in preparation for overseas deployment in 1942. It moved to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO), October‚ÄìNovember 1942, and became part of Twelfth Air Force. Shortly after the group began operations most of its squadrons were detached for separate duty in order to carry out diverse activities over a wide area. Operating from bases in North Africa until November 1943, the group, or elements of the group, engaged in patrolling the Mediterranean; strafing trucks, tanks, gun positions, and supply dumps to support ground troops in Tunisia; training fighter pilots and replacement crews; and flying photographic and visual reconnaissance missions in Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy to provide information needed to adjust artillery fire. The group moved to Italy and became part of Fifteenth Air Force in November 1943. It continued visual and photographic reconnaissance and began flying weather reconnaissance missions in Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the Balkans. Also engaged in electronic-countermeasure activities, investigating radar equipment captured from the enemy, flying ferret missions along the coasts of Italy and southern France, and accompanying bomber formations to detect approaching enemy fighters. Inactivated in 1944, Strategic reconnaissance The unit trained in the Reserve as the 68th Reconnaissance Group at Hamilton Field (later Hamilton AFB), California between, 1947‚Äì1949, when it was inactivated as a result of Continental Air Command's reorganization of its flying units under the Wing Base (Hobson) plan and its personnel transferred to units of the 349th Troop Carrier Wing.See Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 135‚Äì136 and Ravenstein, Combat Wings, pp. 184‚Äì185 The 68th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing was activated by Strategic Air Command (SAC) on 10 October 1951, with an initial cadre of 16 people from the 44th Bombardment Wing. The group was assigned as a subordinate unit to the new wing at Lake Charles AFB, Louisiana. The wing was assigned to the 37th Air Division of Second Air Force. The group was activated as the 68th Strategic Reconnaissance Group, but it was a paper unit, with token personnel assigned on additional duty to keep it active and with its flying squadrons controlled by the wing. Support organizations for the wing were also activated, but they were located at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio and were not controlled by the wing. It was not until May 1952 that the wing received Boeing RB-29 Superfortress aircraft. Its primary mission was gathering intelligence on the Soviet Union. In June the group was discontinued entirely. Under SAC's new Dual Deputate organization,Under this plan flying [and missile] squadrons reported to the wing Deputy Commander for Operations and maintenance squadrons reported to the wing Deputy Commander for Maintenance squadrons all flying and maintenance squadrons were directly assigned to the wing, so no operational group element was needed. It added a Boeing KC-97 refueling mission in November 1953. Strategic bombardmentMedium Bomber era= The wing replaced its propeller-driven RB-29s with new Boeing B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers in October 1953 and was redesignated as the 68th Bombardment Wing. The B-47 was capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. Becoming operationally ready with the B-47 in May 1954, the wing conducted strategic bombardment training and air refueling to meet SAC's global commitments. The wing performed Reflex deployments to RAF Fairford, England from 14 June to 7 August 1954 and to RAF Brize Norton, England from 27 September 1957 to 8 January 1958. The B-47s were reaching the end of their operational lifetime in the late 1950s, and the wing's aircraft were sent to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in April 1963 with the closure of Chennault AFB. With the closing of Chennault, and in order to retain the lineage of 379th, Headquarters SAC received authority from Headquarters USAF to move the 68th without personnel or equipment to Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina on 15 April where it replaced the 4241st Strategic Wing, which could not carry a permanent history or lineageRavenstein, Guide to Air Force Lineage and Honors, p. 12 =Heavy Bombardment era= 4241st Strategic Wing emblem 4241st Strategic Wing SAC had organized the 4241st Strategic Wing at Seymour Johnson on 1 October 1958Mueller, pp. 521‚Äì526 and assigned it to Second Air Force as part of SAC's plan to disperse its Boeing B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. The wing remained a headquarters only until 1 December 1959 when the 911th Air Refueling Squadron, flying Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers, three maintenance squadrons, and a squadron to provide security for special weapons were activated and assigned to the wing. On 5 January 1959 the 73d Bombardment Squadron, consisting of 15 Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses moved to Seymour Johnson from Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico where it had been one of the three squadrons of the 72d Bombardment Wing and the wing was transferred from Second Air Force to the 822d Air Division. The wing was fully organized at the start of May when the 53d Aviation Depot Squadron' moved from Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana to oversee the wing's special weapons. Starting in 1960, one third of the squadron's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute alert, fully fueled and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike. This was increased to half the squadron's aircraft in 1962. The 4241st (and later the 68th) continued to maintain an alert commitment until the end of the Cold War. In 1962, the wing's bombers began to be equipped with the GAM-77 Hound Dog and the GAM-72 Quail air-launched cruise missiles, The 4134th Airborne Missile Maintenance Squadron was activated in November to maintain these missiles. 68th Bombardment Wing, Heavy When the 68th replaced the 4341stThe 68th Wing continued, through temporary bestowal, the history, and honors of the World War II 68th Reconnaissance Group. It was also entitled to retain the honors (but not the history or lineage) of the 4341st Strategic Wing. This temporary bestowal ended when the wing and group were consolidated into a single unit. the 53d Munitions Maintenance Squadron and the 911th Air Refueling Squadron were reassigned to the 68th. The 4241st's maintenance and security squadrons were replaced by ones with the 68th numerical designation. Each of the new units assumed the personnel, equipment, and mission of its predecessor. The wing continued to conduct strategic bombardment training and global refueling operations to meet SAC commitments. Wing aircraft, most aircrews and maintenance personnel, and other support personnel were loaned to other SAC units for combat operations in Southeast Asia, 27 May 1972 ‚Äì 15 July 1973. Air refueling In 1982 the B-52Gs of the wing were retired and the 68th Wing became the 68th Air Refueling Group. Elevated back to wing status in 1986, the 68th Air Refueling Wing participated in combat operations in Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury) in October 1983, in Libya (Operation Eldorado Canyon) in April 1986, and in Panama (Operation Just Cause) in December 1989. It deployed to Spain to provide airlift and air refueling during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm from August 1990 to March 1991. The 68th Air Refueling Wing was inactivated on 22 April 1991 as part of the objective wing reorganization of the Air Force, which called for one wing on a base. Its 911th Air Refueling Squadron was reassigned to the 4th Wing. Its support organizations were inactivated and their personnel and equipment assigned to elements of the 4th Wing or transferred, Modern era The group was activated again on 15 April 1993 as the 68th Electronic Combat Group. It provided operational and technical electronic combat expertise for US combat air forces from 1993 to 1998 when it was inactivated and replaced by the 53d Electronic Warfare Group due to USAF policy that groups carry the same number as their parent wing.See Air Force Instruction 38-101 Manpower and Organization 16 March 2005 Two years later USAF once again acted to preserve this historic unit by consolidating it with the organization that had replaced it. The group performed electronic warfare (EW) technology assessments; tested, developed, managed, and maintained EW systems hardware and software to meet Combat Air Force (CAF) mission requirements, since 1998.

It is primarily a federation of national and transnational organizations. These organizations represent national interests in medical and biological engineering. The objectives of the IFMBE are scientific, technological, literary, and educational. Within the field of medical, biological and clinical engineering IFMBE's aims are to encourage research and the application of knowledge, and to disseminate information and promote collaboration. History of IFMBE In 1959 a group of medical engineers, physicists and physicians met at the 2nd International Conference of Medical and Biological Engineering, in the UNESCO Building, Paris, France to create an organization entitled International Federation for Medical Electronics and Biological Engineering. At that time there were few national biomedical engineering societies and workers in the discipline joined as Associates of the Federation. Later, as national societies were formed, these societies became affiliates of the Federation. In the mid-1960s, the name was shortened to International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering. Its international conferences were held first on a yearly basis, then on a two- year basis and eventually on a three-year basis, to conform to the practice of most other international scientific bodies. As the Federation grew, its constituency and objectives changed. During the first ten years of its existence, clinical engineering became a viable subdiscipline with an increasing number of members employed in the health care area. The IFMBE mandate was expanded to represent those engaged in Research and Development and in Clinical Engineering. The latter category now represents close to half of the total membership. As of October 2010, IFMBE has an estimated 130,000 members in 61 affiliated organizations. It is also associated with the International Organization for Medical Physics (IOMP) since 1976, and together the two bodies established the International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM). Publications *Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing (ISSN 0140-0118) The IFMBE publishes the journal Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing with Springer, aims to cover all fields of Medical and Biological Engineering and Sciences. *IFMBE News The IFMBE News Magazine, published electronically with Springer, documents developments in biomedical engineering. *IFMBE Book Series The official IFMBE book series, Biomedical Engineering represents another service to the Biomedical Engineering Community. *IFMBE Proceedings In co-operation with its World Congress and regional conferences, IFMBE also issues the IFMBE Proceedings Series published with Springer. World Congress The major International Conference of the Federation is now titled the World Congress. Meetings of the Federation are combined with those of the Organization for medical Physics (IOMP) and co-ordinated by the Conference Co-ordinating Committee of the International Union for Physics and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM). The Congresses are scheduled on a three-year basis and aligned with Federation's General Assembly meeting at which elections are held.

James had been proposed as a bridegroom to his cousin Anne Boleyn in 1522 in an attempt to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the earldom of Ormond to which Anne's father, Sir Thomas Boleyn had a claim as his mother had been Lady Margaret Butler, eldest daughter of the 7th earl of Ormond. For reasons unknown, the marriage negotiations came to a halt and Anne later became the second wife of King Henry VIII of England. James and Joan had seven sons: *Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond (c.1532- 22 November 1614), married firstly Elizabeth Berkeley; secondly, Elizabeth Sheffield, by whom he had issue; thirdly, Helen Barry *John Butler of Kilcash (died 10 May 1570), married Katherine MacCartie, by whom he had a son, Walter Butler, 11th Earl of Ormond. *Edward Butler, married Mary Bourke, by whom he had issue. *Walter Butler, married and had one daughter. *Sir Edmund Butler (1534‚Äì1602), married Eleanor Eustace, by whom he had issue. *James Butler of Duiske *Piers Butler On 17 October 1546, James went to dine at Ely House in Holborn, London. He fell victim of a mass poisoning along with his steward and 16 of his servants.Emerson He died on 28 October, leaving Joan a widow in her thirties. As a widow, she could legally act independently and she regained control of her dowry. She sought the help of influential people at court to protect her children's inheritance.Holland She had desired to marry as her second husband her cousin Gerald FitzGerald, heir to the Earldom of Desmond and many years her junior; however, she was forcefully persuaded to marry the English courtier and diplomat Sir Francis Bryan in August 1548. He was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland and the couple returned to Ireland in November 1548. Due to his reputation of being a rake and libertine at the English court, Sir Francis Bryan earned the nickname \\"Vicar of Hell\\". Joan is quoted as saying, \\"While I was a widow and not married [to] an Englishman, I defended and kept my own, or at the least, no man went about to defeat me of my right. Well is the woman unmarried; I am bade to hold my peace, and my husband shall have answer made unto him.\\"Kirwan, John. \\"Lady Joan FitzGerald, Countess of Ormond, Ossory, and Desmond\\", Journal of the Butler Society, 4, 92000), 297. While Bryan lay dying at Clonmel, Joan was allegedly out on a hunting expedition with her cousin, Gerald.Emerson He died on 2 February 1550, and she married Gerald in 1551. Their marriage brought about a temporary peace in Ireland between the rival families of Butler and FitzGerald. Gerald succeeded to the earldom in 1558, making Joan the Countess of Desmond. She used her considerable talent for diplomacy to act as a \\"peacemaker\\" between her eldest son and third husband.Holland Faction fighting between the Butlers and Fitzgeralds  Joan maintained a friendly correspondence with Queen Elizabeth I, who recognised her ability, and relied on her to restore and keep the precarious peace in Munster after her husband, allegedly tired of Joan's domination over him,Emerson broke the truce with her eldest son, Thomas, who had succeeded his father as Earl of Ormond. After the two factions began making raids against one another, Joan spent nearly two weeks journeying back and forth on horseback to arbitrate between the two enemy camps, before a tenuous peace was finally re-established.Emerson In 1562, her husband was sent to the Tower of London for his allegedly \\"insolent\\" behaviour before the Privy Council. Joan worked hard to persuade Queen Elizabeth to release him. She was eventually successful in 1564; however, she herself died on 2 January 1565. She was buried at the Friary of Askeaton in Limerick. Following her death, warfare broke out between the Butlers and Fitzgeralds, with her Butler son emerging the victor after the Battle of Affane in 1565. Joan, in her roles as landowner, household manager, and parent, wielded a powerful influence upon the lives of her tenants, retainers, and children.Holland As a countess-albeit by marriage, she participated significantly in the world of Irish politics and the British royal Tudor court.Holland References Category:16th-century births Category:16th- century Irish people Category:1565 deaths Joan Joan Category:People from County Cork Category:Women of the Tudor period FitzGerald Category:16th- century Irish women Category:Irish countesses ","title":"Joan Fitzgerald, Countess of Ormond"},{"id":"25792638","text":"Hemmo-Silvennoinen-1955 Hemmo Valio Silvennoinen (6 November 1932 in Kes√§lahti ‚Äì 4 December 2002 in Vantaa) was a Finnish ski jumper who competed from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s.

It was originally the most important of the five streets that were part of the √Ñussere Neustadt, which was the section outside the city walls. One fountain, the Ryfflibrunnen on the Aarbergergasse is listed on the Swiss inventory of heritage site of national significanceSwiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance 21.11.2008 version, accessed 12-Jan-2010 and it is part of the UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site that encompasses the Old City. Topography Aarbergergasse was originally one of the most important streets in the unwalled √Ñussere Neustadt. Originally the street ran from the Golatenmatt tower, which was part of the outer city wall, to the Waisenhausplatz. The lane is divided into two different sections, one running west from Sterneng√§sschen to the western end and the other running east from Sterneng√§sschen to Waisenhausplatz. The western section is narrow, curved and lined with arcades. The houses were built with no central plan or unifying style. The eastern section is wider and straight with arcades only on the Schattseite (shadow side or southern side of the road). History Old City of Bern with Aarbergergasse highlighted The region west of the Frauentor (the northern tower of the 2nd city wall) was known as golatunmattun as early as 1279. So, as the city expanded outside the K√§figturm wall into the √Ñussere Neustadt, the northernmost road (which would become Aarbergergasse) was first known as turn an colatten matten and then later shortened to Golatenmattgasse. The main roads to the north and northwest passed through this road because it led to the northernmost entrance into the city. When the 3rd city wall was built in 1344‚Äì46, the Golatenmatt gate was built at the end of Aarbergergasse. The name was officially changed in 1798, but wasn't adopted by the locals until the mid-19th Century. In the night of 14/15 July 1575, a large fire broke out in the area. A total of 43 houses or other buildings were destroyed on Aarbergergasse, Waisenhausplatz and Neuengasse. The city quickly rebuilt 32 houses, paying for the construction from the city treasury. The original wooden buildings were replaced with sandstone walled houses. This was last major reconstruction project of the Old City of Bern. In the 17th-20th Centuries, all the buildings, except for Aarbergergasse 25, were enlarged with additional stories. Nearly all the buildings changed the style of windows over these centuries. However, most of the rest of the architectural elements have remained unchanged.Hofer, pg 454 References Category:Streets in Bern Category:Old City of Bern ","title":"Aarbergergasse"},{"id":"25792781","text":"A√Øn Soltane is a town and commune of A√Øn Defla Province, Algeria.

The mortars were mainly operated by the 20th Independent Mortar Battalion. During the Iwo Jima campaign, many of the 12 to 24 launchers were placed inside the mouths of caves to protect them from American artillery bombardment, requiring the gun crews to live in the caves that housed their guns, like the infantry.

History=Origins From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a movement began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but did not find major commercial success until the late 1990s included the Verve and Radiohead. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead although having achieved moderate recognition with The Bends in 1995 achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).V.

These bands have been seen as looking less to music of the 1960s and more to 1970s punk and post-punk, while still being influenced by Britpop. Significance Bands in the post-Britpop era have been credited with revitalising the British rock music scene in the late 1990s and 2000s, and of reaping the commercial benefits opened up by Britpop. They have also been criticised for providing a \\"homogenised and conformist\\" version of Britpop that serves as music for TV soundtracks, shopping malls, bars and nightclubs.

They take their name from the Argyreia nervosa, a plant commonly known as Hawaiian baby woodrose, which can be used for hallucinogenic effects. History=Early years (2001‚Äì2002) Baby Woodrose was started in 2001 by Uffe Lorenzen, later known under the alias Lorenzo Woodrose. Initially Baby Woodrose was a personal side-project for Lorenzo Woodrose, who was still drummer and songwriter in On Trial then. Lorenzo recorded Baby Woodrose's first album Blows Your Mind by himself on Pan Records (re-released by Bad Afro in 2003). Later on he decided to take the project to the next level and contacted 'The Moody Guru' (Riky Woodrose, bassist) and 'Fuzz Daddy' (Rocco Woodrose, drummer). Breakthrough (2003‚Äì2004) As a power trio they recorded several more albums, the first of which was Money for Soul, released on Bad Afro in 2003. The album catapulted Baby Woodrose into public recognition in Denmark, receiving considerable airplay, and 2003 became a turning point. They won the P3 Award in 2003,http://www.dr.dk/DRPresse/Artikler/2003/12/04/Seks+fik+P3+Guld++og+Baby+Woodrose+tog+topprisen.htm Press announcement from P3, April 12, 2003. the main award in Denmark's largest music award show. The show was broadcast live on national television in Denmark, and during their live musical performance, they were joined on stage by Danish beat music icon Peter Belli. Following the quick success of Baby Woodrose, Lorenzo quit On Trial in 2003, after 17 years in the band.http://www.prog-sphere.com/2011/03/03/baby-woodrose/ An interview with Lorenzo Woodrose on Prog Sphere They released a live record of their performance on Gutter Island Garage Rock Festival, Live at Gutter Island later in 2003. In 2004, Baby Woodrose played the opening show on the main stage of Roskilde Festival, Denmark's largest music festival. They closed the stage again three days later, playing the final show under the title \\"An Evening with Baby Woodrose\\".http://www.roskilde-festival.dk/music/2004/an-evening- with-baby-woodrose/ Roskilde Festival's programme, 2004 Same year they were nominated for the Danish Music Awards in 2004, which they didn't win however. They also released Dropout!, which was an album of cover songs by other artists, such as The Savages and 13th Floor Elevators in 2004.http://www.discogs.com/Baby-Woodrose-Dropout/master/321463 Dropout! on Discogs.com Post-breakthrough (2005‚Äì2010) 2006 saw the release of the follow-up studio album with the band's own songs, after their breakthrough. The album Love Comes Down was released on Playground Music Scandinavia, as the only collaboration between Baby Woodrose and a larger record label (Lorenzo later bought the master tapes back, to re-release Love Comes Down on Bad Afro). The mainstream media's interest was not as massive as earlier, but Baby Woodrose had attracted a following in the psychedelic underground, and continued to tour and release records. There were some changes in the band's lineup during the following years, and Lorenzo Woodrose lent himself to various side-projects, such as Dragontears and The Setting Son. He also played a few reunion concerts with an older side-project, Spids N√∏genhat (the Danish name for the psilocybin mushroom 'liberty cap', Psilocybe semilanceata), one of which were to spark a renewed interest for Baby Woodrose. Renewed interest (2011‚Äì) Lorenzo Woodrose performed with Spids N√∏genhat, an old side-project brought back to life, on Roskilde Festival 2011. The Spids N√∏genhat project was very little known, but the show at Roskilde Festival, which took place at 02:00 AM, became a big hit.http://roskilde- festival.dk/dk/band/singleband/spids-noegenhat/ The small stage was packed with audience, who kept chanting the chorus of the last song \\"Er vi de sidste her p√• jorden?\\" for hours after the show.http://gaffa.dk/anmeldelse/50868 This led to a renewed interest in Baby Woodrose's music, reflected in the number of audience showing up for concerts in Copenhagen. In 2012 the album Third Eye Surgery was released, displaying a more space rock type sound from the band, which was well received among critics and fans.http://gaffa.dk/anmeldelse/58519 Third Eye Surgery review in Gaffa, April 16, 2012 Baby Woodrose released Freedom, the group's eleventh full-length, on September 16, 2016. Freedom displays a more politically outright Baby Woodrose with a powerful, distorted rock sound in the veins of Third Eye Surgery (2012). Since the album release, Baby Woodrose's live line-up has included two former members, Anders Gr√∏n (Fuzz Daddy) on drums and Anders Skj√∏dt (Moody Guru) on bass guitar, with Mads Saaby (Yobo) continuing on guitar alongside Lorenzo. Baby Woodrose announced a break from live concerts from the summer 2016. Since then Lorenzo Woodrose has released a new solo album, Galmandsv√¶rk (Bad Afro, 2017) under his own name, Uffe Lorenzen, which he tours with. Lineup changes Some years after joining, Moody Guru and Fuzz Daddy both left Baby Woodrose. K√•re Joenson replaced Moody Guru on the bass, and for some time, Johan Lei-Gellett replaced Fuzz Daddy on drums with Adam Olsson joining on guitar. Johan Lei-Gellett and Adam Olsson (both of the surf band, The Good The Bad) were later replaced by Geronimo (drums) and Yobo (guitar), resulting in the most stable lineup in later years: * Lorenzo Woodrose: Lead guitar, lead vocals. * K√•re Joensen: Bass, vocals. * Yobo: Guitar, vocals. * Geronimo: Drums. After the 2016 release of the album Freedom old members Fuzz Daddy and Moody Guru have replaced Geronimo and Joensen in the live lineup.

At the age of 13, he watched a performance on television by Hank Williams. Duly inspired and equipped with a cheap guitar purchased by his father, he started playing the songs previously performed by Freddie King and Floyd London. As he lived close to the Duke/Peacock recording studio, Robertson took the opportunity to acquaint himself with some of the musicians who recorded there. At the same time, in his late teens, Robertson played in a band in various bars of his Fifth Ward, Houston neighborhood. In 1982, Clifton Chenier heard Robertson's band playing at the Crosstown Blues Festival. Robertson moved back to Louisiana, learned to play slide guitar, and toured for several years in the 1980s with Chenier. Robertson contributed to his Live At The (1982) and San Francisco Blues Festival (1985) albums. After Chenier's death, Robertson played with Rockin' Dopsie, appearing on his Crowned Prince Of Zydeco album (1986), and Terrance Simien & the Mallet Playboys, before going solo. In addition, Robertson's guitar work appeared on Paul Simon's Graceland album, and he was on the bill at the 1994 Notodden Blues Festival. Robertson's I'm the Man (1994) was the first release on the Code Blue label. It was nominated for a W.C. Handy Award. Robertson's follow-up, Here & Now (1995), included his cover of the Tracy Nelson song \\"Here & Now\\". However the record label folded and Robertson re- appeared in 1998 on the independent label, Audioquest, with his next offering, Going Back Home.

Its primary method is to create intensive collaborative relationships between students and working field researchers through structured programs involving the University of Chicago and other institutions. In January 2010, it received a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. The organization, founded in 1999, is based in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Activities Project Exploration currently serves nearly 1,000 students. It began as an after-school and summer program when Gabrielle Lyon, a teacher at Fiske Elementary School on the South Side of Chicago, decided that students underrepresented in the sciences, primarily girls and minorities, should be given opportunities to collaborate with actual scientists and participate in real-life scientific research. Students design research projects and test them in the field, or work summers at museums demonstrating science to young children. *Sisters4Science Sisters4Science is a year-round after-school and field program that combines science exploration with leadership development for approximately 100 minority middle school girls. Girls participate in hands-on science activities led by women scientists as well as participate in science-based field trips. *Girls Health and Science Day Project Exploration organizes a one-day symposium with workshops on the topics of sexuality and tolerance, healthy relationships, self-worth, the female body, and self- defense for female students across Chicago in grades 7-10. * All Girls Expedition The All Girls Expedition is an intensive two-week classroom and field work experience for twenty girls . It includes intensive classroom instruction in geology, biology, evaluation, and field skills followed by one week working in the field alongside scientists. A recent expedition was to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, to conduct fieldwork on the water chemistry of geysers, track coyotes and explore a cave with Project Exploration and Yellowstone researchers. * The Science Teacher Field Institute The Science Teacher Field Institute is an annual three-week professional development program for Chicago Public School teachers which includes both classroom and field experience with scientists in the disciplines of geology, paleontology, and astronomy. All costs are covered by private donations. This program includes field work at eastern Montana's Lost-in-Time Ranch under supervision of professional paleontologists from the University of Chicago and Project co-founder Gabrielle Lyon. Presidential Award The Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, awarded each year to individuals or organizations, recognizes the crucial role that mentoring plays in the academic and personal development of students studying science or engineering and who belong to minorities that are underrepresented in those fields. By offering their time, encouragement and expertise to these students, mentors help ensure that the next generation of scientists and engineers will better reflect the diversity of the United States. Candidates for the Presidential Mentoring Award are nominated by colleagues, administrators, and students from their home institutions. The mentoring can involve students at any grade level from elementary through graduate school. In addition to being honored at the White House, recipients receive awards of $10,000 to advance their mentoring efforts. \\"There is no higher calling than furthering the educational advancement of our nation‚Äôs young people and encouraging and inspiring our next generation of leaders,\\" President Obama said. \\"These awards represent a heartfelt salute of appreciation to a remarkable group of individuals who have devoted their lives and careers to helping others and in doing so have helped us all.\\" The award to Project Exploration was announced in July 2009. The award ceremony took place in January 2010 at the White House.

Set in 19th-century India, It is acclaimed as one of the masterpiece of Gujarati literature. Though the novel was published in four parts, each part has a distinct thematic content, its own cast of characters and independent beginnings and ends. It was adapted into several plays, radio plays, films and TV series. It was well received by the number of critics, and was translated into several Indian languages, along with English. However, Suresh Joshi, a strong proponent of formalism theory, criticized the novel for its structural failure. Publication history Govardhanram Tripathi The novel takes its title after the name of its protagonist. The novel was written over a period of 15 years, with the first volume being published in 1887 and the fourth one in 1901. Govardhanram began to write first part on 18 September 1885 and published it in April 1887. He started to write second part in 1888, completed in June 1891 and published it on 9 June 1892, and in the next year he started to write third part, which he completed in 17 October 1896 and published in 1898. On 20 December 1896, he started to write fourth part and completed it on 23 December 1901. The fourth part was published in 1902. Characters There are about 150 characters in the novel, among which the principal characters are: * Saraswatichandra - a young lawyer, an idealist * Lakshminandan - Saraswatichandra's father, a rich merchant * Gunasundari - Saraswatichandra's mother in low * Kumud or Kumudsundari - betrothed to Saraswatichandra * Buddhidhan - minister of Suvarnapur * Pramadadhan - son of Buddhidhan * Kusum - sister of Kumud * Guman - stepmother of Saraswatichandra Structure Volumes of Saraswatichandra at Gujarati Sahitya Parishad library Spanned about in 2000 pages, the novel divided into four parts with subtitle: The Administration of Buddhidhan, The Family-maze of Gunasundari, The Political Administration of Ratnanagari and The Dreamland of Saraswati. As the titles suggest, the first part is about the administration of Buddhidhan, the second about Gunasundari's family life, the third about the politics of Ratnanagari, and the fourth about the consciousness of Saraswatichandra, the hero. The novel begin with the Saraswatichandra's arrival in Suvarnapur and his meeting with Buddhidhan, a Divan of Suvarnapur. Hence, the first part gives an account of politics and conspiracy in Suvarnapur under the administration of Buddhidhan. At the end of the first part Kumud, wife of Pramadadhan who is a son of Buddhidhan, leaves Suvarnapur to visit her parents home. Thus, the second part gives an account of Kumud's family. As Kumud's father is a Divan in Ratnanagari, the third part is about the political administration of Ratnanagari. While all social, political and religious reflections are concentrated in the last part. Plot summary The novel take place in two fictional towns, Suvarnapur and Ratnanagari. Saraswatichandra, the protagonist of the novel, is a well educated, young lawyer deeply interested in literature, quite emotional and idealistic. He has been engaged to marry Kumudsundari (daughter of Vidyachatur - a Divan of Ratnanagari), a charming and proficient lady. But for certain reasons, Saraswatichandra renounce his home. He assumes the name Navinchandra and starts his pilgrimage. As a result, Kumudsundari's parents marry her to Pramadadhan, the wayward son of Buddhidhan of Suvarnapur. Subsequently, Saraswatichandra (with the pseudonym of Navinchandra) arrives in Suvarnapur and has a meeting with Buddhidhan. Impressed by his eloquent talk and command over English, Buddhidhan invites him to stay with him. Saraswatichandra accepts Buddhidhan's proposal, resides at his home and finally becomes important member of Buddhidhan's family. But soon after, Saraswatichandra leaves Buddhidhan's house due to the tensions that contact with Kumud is causing them both, but on the way, he is attacked by bandits. The Sadhus of Sundargiri pick him and nurse him. At the same night, Kumud also leave Suvarnapur to visit her parents home and on the way, get attacked by the same bandits gang, but is saved by her grandfather, who had come halfway to receive her. Kumud somehow falls into the river and is picked up by Sadhvis at the bank of the river. Reception and criticism Saraswatichandra has been described as a magnum opus of Govardhanram, and as a 'highest pinnacle of Gujarati literature'. Anandshankar Dhruv described the novel as a purana; Vishwanath Bhatt called it an 'epic in prose'; while Dolarrai Mankad hailed it as 'Sakalakatha'. Umashankar Joshi also appreciated the novel and called it 'the poem of the Age written in prose'. The size of Saraswatichandra was criticized in the context of form-content relationship. But, Ramnarayan V. Pathak observed that the looseness of the novel does not diminish from its aesthetic beauty. However, Suresh Joshi, a strong proponent of formalism, criticized the novel for its structural failure. One of his student and critic Suman Shah, also supported Joshi's statement. K. M. Munshi called it the 'gigantic' work of Govardhanram and wrote, \\"The Sarasvatichandra, as a work of fiction, is poor, but as a record of the impact of the West on the thought, outlook and life of India, it is the most outstanding work in Gujarati literature. It exerted profound influence on Gujarat during the last decade of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th\\" It is believed that Govardhanram has sketched his own various personality through this novel. Translation and adaptations Saraswatichandra was translated and published in English by the director of Sabarmati Ashram, Tridip Suhrud, in four volumes starting 2015. The book was also translated into Hindi by Alok Gupta and Virendranarayan Sinh in 2015 and was published by Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi. The novel was adapted in several plays, radio plays, films and TV series. One play was adapted in lifetime of Tripathi. One adapted was adapted by Raghunath Brahmabhatt of Nadiad which became very popular. It was adapted for radio too. The Hindi film Saraswatichandra (1968) was based on this novel. Chhotalal Rukhdev Sharma had adapted it into a play produced by Aryanitidarshak Natak Samaj which premiered on 11 March 1912. The novel was adapted in 1972 Gujarati film Gunsundarino Gharsansar, directed by Govind Saraiya, which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Gujarati at the 20th National Film Awards. The film was considered important for its artistry and aesthetic. It was adapted in TV serials four times. The 2013 television series of the same name based on the novel was broadcast on Star Plus in 2013‚Äì14. The novel was retold in abridged version by Sameer Acharya. The version was published by HarperCollins India in 2018.

This is contrasted with other guardian figures such as family gods responsible for the well-being of individual clans or professions, or personal gods who are responsible for the well-being of individuals. These guardian roles augment the functions that a divinity might otherwise have (wisdom, health, war, and so on). Ancient gods In antiquity (and to some extent continuing today), religion was a characteristic of regional culture, together with language, customs, traditions, etc. Many of these ethnic religions included national god(s) in their pantheons, such as *Amaterasu of the Japanese; *Amun, Amun-Ra and Horus for the Egyptians; *Apollo for the people of Troy; *eponymous Assur for the Assyrians; *Ashtoret for the Sidonians; *the eponymous Athena-Mykene for the Athenians and Mycenaeans; *Baal for the Tyrians; *Bathala of the Tagalogs; *Chemosh for the Moabites; *Dagon for Philistia; *Gaut for the Geats; *Huitzilopochtli of the Tenochtitlan Aztecs; *Indra for the Vedic Indians; *Inti for the Incas; *Itzamna for the Mayas; *Jhulelal/Zinda Pir, a river protector of the sacred Sindhu River revered by ancient Pakistanis *Lugh (Gaulish Mercury, Lugus, Lleu) for the ancient Celts; *Marduk for the Babylonians; *Mars and eponymous Romulus-Quirinus for the Romans; *Ninsusinak for the Elamites; *Perun for the ancient Slavs; *Qos for the Edomites; *Siam Devadhiraj for the Thais; *the Sovereignty goddess and eponymous √âriu for Ireland; *Tengri for the Turks and Mongols; *Teshub for the Hittites;A Dictionary of Ancient Near Eastern Mythology *Wadd for the Kingdom of Awsan; *Yahweh for the Israelites; *Zalmoxis for the Dacians. In antiquity In antiquity, each ethnic group (nation) had its own pantheon, which may or may not have overlapped with that of neighbouring groups. Many of these religions had guardian figures, which then sometimes included national gods, who were considered responsible for the safety and well-being of the nation and of its people, with a special concern for the nation's ruler and guardian. These national gods stood alongside the personal gods, that is, the patron gods who took a special interest in an individual's personal well-being. Additionally, there were the family gods associated with the care of a clan or profession, as well as gods associated with specific situations or the protection thereof (fertility, health, war, contracts and so on). This perception of divinity was common in the ancient world. Deities were often geographically localized by association to their main cult centers, and in the Ancient Near East were often tutelary deities of their respective city-states. Many of the individual ethnic groups also considered itself the progeny of its national gods. For example, in the region that is now Yemen, the Sabaeans, the Minaeans and the Himyar each perceived themselves to be the children of respectively Almaqah, Wadd and Shamash.. Similarly, in Canaan, Milcom held that role for the Ammonites, while Chemosh did so for the Moab. Yahweh's role as God of the Judaeans and Samarians is a key reason for that figure's adoption as the monist figure by the Yahweh-only movement of the 7th-century BC. Yahweh's subsequent exaltation as a supreme figure occurred not because national gods were necessarily heads of their pantheons (this was certainly not the case for the national gods of the peoples surrounding Israel), but as a reaction to the changing political landscape, in which other national gods had previously become exalted in that fashion. Because peoples were perceived to effectively worship the same gods, merely by different names (Smith (2008) terms this \\"translatability\\"), Yahweh's function as a national god had previously automatically equated him with other national gods. Thus, with the rise of the multi-cultural Assyrian Empire in the 10th century BC, the concomitant rise of the Assyrian's nation god Assur to inter-cultural prominence influenced how national gods were generally perceived. Moreover, the political unification of the fractured nation-states under a single supreme head of state encouraged the idea of a multi-national \\"one-god\\" worldview as well. By the 7th-century BC however, Assyria was in decline and the smaller nation-states began to reassert their independence. In this context, the development of a \\"one-god\\" worldview in 7th century BC Kingdom of Judah can be perceived as a response to the diminishing claims to cultural hegemony of the Assyrian \\"one-god\\" ideology of the time.. The process is evident in some parts of the Torah which predate the 6th century BC and thus preserve vestiges of the theology centered on a national god during the 10th-century BC monarchic period.. \\"The OT is still conscious of the fact that Yhwh, the national god of Israel, originally was one of the gods in the council of El.\\" (Deut 32:8-9*). Modern period=Philippine In search of a national culture and identity, away from those imposed by Spain during the 300-year Spanish-Christian colonial age, Filipino revolutionaries during the Philippine revolution proposed to revive the indigenous Philippine folk religions and make them the national religion of the entire country. The Katipunan opposed the religious teachings of the Spanish Christian friars, saying that they \\"obscured rather than explained religious truths.\\" After the revival of the Katipunan during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, an idealized form of the folk religions was proposed by some, with the worship of God under the ancient name of Bathala, which applies to all supreme deities under the many ethnic pantheons in the Philippines. However, the re-vitalization process of the indigenous faiths of the Philippines did not progress further as the Filipino forces were defeated by the Americans in 1902, which led to the second Christian colonization of the archipelago. Christianity Christian missionaries have repeatedly re-interpreted national gods in terms of the Christian God. This fact is reflected in the names of God in various languages of Christianized peoples, such as Shangdi or Shen among Chinese Christians, Ngai among a number of tribes of Kenya, etc. In a modern context, the term of a \\"national god\\" addresses the emergence of national churches within Christianity. This tendency of \\"nationalizing\\" the Christian God, especially in the context of national churches sanctioning warfare against other Christian nations during World War I, was denounced as heretical by Karl Barth.Barth, Ethnics, ed. Braun, transl. Bromiley, New York, 1981, p. 305. Germanic Carl Jung in his essay Wotan (1936) identifies the Germanic god of the storm (leader of the Wild Hunt), Wotan, as the national god of the German people, and warns of the rise of German nationalism and ultimately the then-impending catastrophe of Nazism and World War II in terms of the re- awakening of this god: :\\"But what is more than curious -- indeed, piquant to a degree -- is that an ancient god of storm and frenzy, the long quiescent Wotan, should awake, like an extinct volcano, to new activity, in a civilized country that had long been supposed to have outgrown the Middle Ages. [...] I venture the heretical suggestion that the unfathomable depths of Wotan's character explain more of National Socialism than all three reasonable factors [viz. economic, political, and psychological] put together. [...] This is a tragic experience and no disgrace. It has always been terrible to fall into the hands of a living god. Yahweh was no exception to this rule, and the Philistines, Edomites, Amorites and the rest, who were outside the Yahweh experience, must certainly have found it exceedingly disagreeable. The Semitic experience of Allah was for a long time an extremely painful affair for the whole of Christendom. We who stand outside judge the Germans far too much, as if they were responsible agents, but perhaps it would be nearer the truth to regard them, also, as victims.\\"First published in Neue Schweizer Rundschau (Zurich) (March, 1936), 657-69.

History One of the oldest preparatory schools in the United States, Lawrenceville was founded in 1810 as the Maidenhead Academy by Presbyterian clergyman Isaac Van Arsdale Brown. As early as 1828, the school attracted students from Cuba and England, as well as from the Cherokee Nation. It had several names, including the Lawrenceville Classical and Commercial High School, the Lawrenceville Academy, and the Lawrenceville Classical Academy, before its current name, \\"The Lawrenceville School,\\" was adopted during its refounding under the John Cleve Green Foundation in 1883. An area of the campus built then, including the Hamill House and numerous other buildings, has been designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark District. This portion of the campus includes buildings designed to a master plan by Peabody and Sterns, with landscape design by Frederick Law Olmsted.\\"Lawrenceville School National Historic Landmark\\" , National Park Service. Accessed July 27, 2011. An addition to the campus outside of that district was built in the 1920s. Lawrenceville's student body was almost entirely white for its first 150 years, with the first African American student admitted in 1964. Lawrenceville was featured in a number of novels by Owen Johnson, class of 1895, notably The Prodigious Hickey, The Tennessee Shad, and The Varmint (1910). The Varmint, which recounts the school years of the fictional character Dink Stover, was made into the 1950 motion picture The Happy Years, starring Leo G. Carroll and Dean Stockwell, and was filmed on the Lawrenceville campus. A 1986 PBS miniseries was based on Johnson's Lawrenceville tales.Johnson, Malcolm. \\"Regaining The Spirit Of Prep School Stories\\", Hartford Courant, November 15, 2001.

The area also has several honey-producing bee hives, part of the Big Red Farm, which ring the perimeter of the array.\\"The Lawrenceville School Signs Six Megawatt Solar Power Purchase Agreement with TurtleEnergy\\" , Lawrenceville School News, September 3, 2010. Accessed July 27, 2011. \\"Fully operational, the solar array will produce 8,500 megawatt-hours annually of clean electricity or more than 90 percent of the School's needs, offset of , and provide a setting to teach sustainable energy and the use of materials, land, and water in ways that promote ecological literacy and sustainability. The natural slope of the 30-acre site, currently part of a farm that is a part of Lawrenceville's 700-acre campus, will make the solar farm invisible from Route 206 and only partially visible from Lewisville Road.\\" Affiliations Lawrenceville athletics compete in the Mid-Atlantic Prep League.

He had used the Right to Information Act to expose irregularities in Government offices in the last five years. He was killed on 13 January 2010, by unknown attackers in Talegaon.Whistleblower RTI activist Satish Shetty killedRTI activist Satish Shetty killed near Pune Background and Killing In recent years, Shetty had used the RTI Act to expose large scale land scams involving the leading real estate firm IRB Infrastructure and its subsidiary Aryan. In 2009, he filed a complaint that forged documents had been used by these firms to acquire large swathes of land in the Taje and Pimploli villages off the Pune-Mumbai highway. After investigations, 90 sale deeds were cancelled, and sub-registrar Ashwini Kshirsagar was suspended. The company blamed land brokers for the irregularities, and the planned IRB township project was eventually scrapped. After this episode, Shetty started getting threat calls. In November 2009, he filed a request with the Pune rural police seeking protection. In the request, he said that he had been receiving threats allegedly originating with Virendra Mhaiskar,http://ibnlive.in.com/news/rti- activist-satish-shetty-murder-case-cbi-searches-irb-premises/303498-37.html chairman of IRB Infrastructure. Protection was not granted. In January 2010, Shetty was knifed by several people while he was at a kiosk reading a paper after his morning walk. The subsequent police investigations proposed a different theory for the murder, ignoring the IRB infrastructure association. Quote: While granting bail to Waghmore for Rs 25,000, the court observed, \\"In spite of the fact that Sandip Shetty, in his affidavit, had said that the dispute between Satish and Dabhade was settled over a year before he was killed, the investigation continued in the same direction.\\" Eventually the case was transferred to the CBI. In Oct 2012, CBI raided the offices of IRB Infrastructure http://ibnlive.in.com/news/rti-activist-satish-shetty-murder- case-cbi-searches-irb-premises/303498-3-237.html and that of IRB advocate Ajit Kulkarni.

They are also found in some areas of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland. They are recognized as a Scheduled tribe within the State of Assam. They were known as Lalungs in the Assamese Buranjis, Colonial literatureBhuyan S.K. (ed.) Deodhai Asam Buranji. Gauhati: DHAS, 1932.Hunter W. A statistical account of Assam. London: Trubner, 1879. and in the Constitution of India, though members of the group prefer to call themselves Tiwa (meaning \\"the people who were lifted from below\\"). Some of their neighbors still call them Lalung. A striking peculiarity of the Tiwa is their division into two sub-groups, Hill Tiwa and Plains Tiwas, displaying contrasting cultural features. Origin According to late Bishnu Prasad Rabha, the Tiwas are originally the Patorgoyan clan of the Chutias (now officially Tiwas and Chutias are two separate communities of North East, India). He said that the word \\"Chutia\\" became \\"Tia/Tiwa\\" by omitting the first part \\"Chu\\". The Patorgoyan clan is no more found among Chutia, and are believed to have migrated to the west. The Ahoms upon their arrival in Assam also called the Chutias as \\"Tiura\\". Dalton has also remarked that the tribe called \\"Tiwa\\" are of the same family and the \\"Lalungs\\" of Upper Assam claim to be of Chutia descent. Surnames like Pator (chiefs), Dewri (priests), Bhuyan (landlords), Bordoloi (councilor), Borah (minister) all have roots in the Chutia kingdom. The origin of the word \\"Lalung\\" hasn't yet been decided by the historians. In the Karbi language, \\"Lalung\\" means \\"sinking from the water\\", while in the Tai language (Ahom), it means \\"migration towards the west\\". From this, it can be presumed that the Tiwa people first met the Karbis when they proceeded towards the west to Nagaon by crossing the Brahmaputra. This is moreover supported by the folklore of the Tiwa people who believe that they migrated a long time back from their homeland which was situated in the eastern part of undivided Darrang district (Sonitpur district). The memory of their original homeland is expressed in their popular song \\"Lali-lai-Hilali\\". This folklore of Hilali is also shared by the Sadiyal Kacharis (i.e. Sonowals, Chutias, Deoris) which points out to the fact that the entire area including the hills of Arunachal, and the present-day districts of Sonitpur, Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sibsagar was once a single kingdom which was bounded by the Dikarai and Dikhou. Researchers like Robert Shafer, George Greirson and Dr. Suniti Chatterjee have all placed the Tiwa, Kokborok and the Chutia language as belonging to a single family under Kachari languages. In the 'Assam Census report, 1881' Wadell makes a significant proposition about the Tiwas, \\"The Lalungs got mixed up with the Garos and the Mikirs. They have numerous exogamous clans\\". This could be one of the reasons as to why the Ahom chroniclers could not differentiate between the Tiwas and the other tribes of the hills, and the reason why the Tiwas developed a unique culture of their own retaining old customs from their homeland as well as getting influenced from the Karbis and Garos. Later period The Buranjis (Assamese chronicles) recount the meeting of Assamese soldiers with \\"people of the margins\\"(datiyaliya) and the settlement of 12 families of Lalung and Mikir, i.e. Tiwas and Karbis, in the plains in the 17th century.Bhuyan S.K. (ed.) Deodhai Asam Buranji. Gauhati: DHAS, 1932. Tiwa people are closely associated with the principality of Gobha.Ramirez, 2014 The Gobha raja belongs to a Tiwa clan and his territory covers more or less the Tiwa cultural realm. Gobha is mentioned in the Buranjis since the early 18th century, as an important market for the trade between Tiwa (Lalung) Kingdom of greater Assam, and the Jaintia Kingdom.Bhuyan S.K. (ed.) Deodhai Asam Buranji. Gauhati: DHAS, 1932; p.35. These two powerful neighbors have since been competing to keep Gobha principality under their authority, with varying success. The historical role of Gobha and the Tiwas as mediators between plains and hills in Central Assam is enacted every year during an old fair, the Jonbeel mela. Hill Tiwas The Hill Tiwas live in the westernmost areas of \\"The Ancient Lalung - Tiwa Hills\\" now known as Umswai of Amri block in West Karbi Anglong district (Assam) and as well as in the Northeastern corner of Ri-Bhoi district (Meghalaya). They speak a Tibeto-Burman language of the Bodo-Garo group. They are divided into a dozen clans recognized by specific names which they use as patronymics. Their descent system can be said to be ambilineal.Ramirez, Philippe, People of the Margins, Spectrum, 2014 In most cases, the husband goes to live in her wife's family settlement (matrilocality), and their children are included in their mother's clan. However, in about 30% of unions, the woman comes to live with her husband. In such cases, children take the name of their father. This trend is on the rise under the influence of neighbouring populations which are mostly patrilineal. About one-half of Hill Tiwas follow their \\"traditional\\" religion. It is based on the worship of local deities. The other half has been converted to Christianity since the 1950s. The Hill Tiwas society is organized around seven old villages which constitute its political as well as ritual center. Each of them harbors a chief (loro) who performs judicial and religious duties for a network of settlements. Old villages are also characterized by their bachelor dormitory (shamadi). A Tiwa Women Preparing food Plains Tiwas Plains Tiwas live on the flatlands of the Southern bank of the Brahmaputra valley, The following places below are the areas mostly in Morigaon, Nagaon, Hojai, Kamrup (Rural) and (Metro), Sibsagar, Jorhat, Sonitpur, Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts. The vast majority speak Assamese as their mother tongue, Tiwa language is still spoken on the foothills and in rare villages of the plains. Their descent system is definitely patrilineal. Their patronymics are not derived from their clan's names but are common Assamese and plain Tiwas ethnic surname-names instead (mostly Lalung, Pator, Senapati, Manta, Dekaraja, Dewraja, Bordoloi, Konwar, Doloi, Kakoti, Deka, Dewri, Deuri, Deory, Deori, Bhuyan, etc.). Their religion shares many elements with Assamese Hinduism but remains specific. Tiwa clan system The Tiwa community is divided into several Phoit (Wali) and Dilok (divided into exogamous clans and again the clans are sub-divided into many sub-clans) Example - Amsai wali, Marjong wali, Magro, Sagra, Mayong, Lingra, Lumphui, Amkha, Amlera, Amni baro, Amnisa, Rongkhoi baro, Rongkhoisa. The Wali or Phoits have their own own Loro. The 'Loro' (priest) is the Governor of the 12 Phoits or Wali kingdoms. Now in every Phoits there is a Sat Phuni, Baro Phuni called Khul, Pongos, Khel, Mahar, and Warang. Tiwa have various Khuls, they can marry with other Khul but not with Pongos, Khel, and Warang (means that they are allowed to marry people from other clans). A single khul consists of several Khel Mahar. In every Khul there are different Khel called Warang. Note: Khul = Clan, (i) Pongos, (a) Khel, Warang The Tiwa clans cooperate with one another as a community, whether constructing a house, harvesting rice, or worshiping. Every clan has its own place of community worship where there is a titular for the clan's god. The List of clans of the Tiwa (Lalung): 1\\\\. Agari (‡¶Ü‡¶ó‡¶æ‡ß∞‡¶ø), 2\\\\.

Tiwa festivals Festivals constitute a significant part of the culture of the Tiwa people. There are many festivals of Tiwa tribes. Tiwa people celebrate several occasions and festivals. The main festivals of the Tiwa tribes are: Three Pisu (Bihu), Borot utsav, Sogra puja, Wanshuwa, Jonbeel Mela, Kabla, Langkhon Puja, Yangli Puja, etc. Tiwas celebrate Christmas, New Year, and Easter. They consider Christmas the best. In the festivals, the Tiwa communities sing two types of songs. These are: 1) Lo Ho La Hai - songs of the ceremony of name giving, wedding and harvesting, etc. 2) Lali Hilali Lai‚Äì song of the marriage ceremony, Karam and similar festivals. *Songs and dances are the life spirit of the Tiwa community; the tribe is considered to have one of the richest reservoirs of folk songs and dances in the state of Assam and Meghalaya. Population A Hill Tiwa house Tiwa population in India is 371,000 approx. (2011 census). But according to the 2001 Census reports 161,000 approx. \\"Tiwas/Lalungs\\"; this figure comprises only the Plains Tiwas. As they became a Scheduled Tribe after the 2001 Census, the Hill Tiwas were not taken into account. Their population may be estimated at around 10,000 approx. The total number of Tiwa speakers amounts only to 34, 800 approx. (2011 Census).The Joshua Project lists the Tiwa population as 348,000 with no quoted reference. This figure seems largely over-estimated Joshua Project entry on Tiwa Official status Tiwas, under the denomination of \\"Lalung\\", have been recorded as a Scheduled Tribe since the first Constitution Order (1950) for the State of Assam \\"excluding the autonomous districts of Karbi Anglong and North Cachar Hills (now named Dima Hasao)\\", thus leaving the Hill Tiwas out. It was only in 2002 that the Lalung ST status has been extended to Karbi-Anglong district and thus to the Hill Tiwas. Tiwas still do not benefit the ST status in the State of Meghalaya.

The legislation provided $1.5 billion for a National Surface Transportation System through September 30, 2011, \\"to be awarded on a competitive basis for capital investments in surface transportation projects\\". Requirements The U.S. government designed TIGER grants in order to incentivize bettering environmental problems and reducing the United States' dependence on energy. On the economic front, the United States hopes infrastructure investment will encourage job creation, a pressing political priority; this would likely require the project to be shovel-ready. Eligible applicants Applicants eligible to receive funding for surface transportation projects include: * State and local governments, including U.S. territories and regional tribal councils * Transit agencies * Port authorities * Metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) * Multi-state or multi-jurisdictional applicants Qualifications Qualified projects should result in \\"desirable, long-term outcomes\\" for the United States, a state within, or a regional or metropolitan area. According to Title 23 of the United States Code, eligible projects could include improvements to interstate highways, reworking of interchanges, bridge replacements, earthquake-related improvements, relocating roads, upgrading rural collector roads, certain transit projects, passenger and freight rail transportation projects, and port infrastructure. Selected projects might improve the economy of the entire country, transportation safety, and quality of life for communities. Funding history=TIGER I (2009) U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood announced the TIGER discretionary grants program on February 4, 2009. Lana T. Hurdle, deputy assistant secretary for budget and programs, and Joel Szabat, deputy assistant secretary for transportation policy, co-chaired the team responsible for selecting projects and monitoring spending. Out of nearly 1,400 applications who collectively submitted $60 billion in applications, the Department of Transportation was only able to award $1.5 billion in TIGER grant funds to a just 3% of applicants‚Äî51 innovative projects. TIGER II (2010) The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2010 made $600 million available for transportation infrastructure investment. TIGER III (2011) On June 30, 2011, Secretary LaHood announced that nearly $527 million would go towards the third round of TIGER fund disbursal. On December 15, 2011, that $511 million from the TIGER grant program would fund 46 transportation projects in 33 states and Puerto Rico. TIGER IV (2012) The fourth round of TIGER funding‚Äîclose to $500 million‚Äîwent to 47 transportation projects in 34 states and the District of Columbia. For fiscal year 2012, Democratic districts won projects that concern ports, multimodal transport, and freight rail transport; receiving 24% of total funds, rural areas also performed strongly. TIGER 2013 Although federal funding no longer referred to the funding allocations as TIGER grants, the US DOT continued to allocate these funds according to the same formula and continued to use the TIGER name. In 2013, 51 projects received TIGER funds, totaling approximately $458.3 million. TIGER 2014 In 2014, the US Congress appropriated $600 million for TIGER funds. The US DOT received 797 applications requesting more than $9.5 billion. Seventy-two capital and planning projects in 46 states and the District of Columbia were selected for funding that totaled more than $584 million. TIGER 2015 The seventh round of TIGER grants generated 625 applications requesting $9.8 billion worth of projects; of those projects, 60 were road projects, 18 percent were transit projects, and eight percent were rail projects, and port and bicycle and pedestrian projects made up six percent of the total.

It is endemic to Guangxi province in southern China, and only known from a subterranean tributary of the Hongshui River, a tributary of the Pearl River. Its specific name donglanensis refers to the Donglan County where its type locality is located. It is not known from elsewhere. Description Sinocyclocheilus donglanensis grows to standard length; mean length of five individuals was . The head is compressed and has developed eyes. The mouth has two barbels and is slightly inferior, with the upper jaw that protrudes slightly beyond the lower one. The body is compressed and completely scaled. The highest body depth (about 31% of standard length) occurs exactly at the dorsal fin insertion. The lateral line is complete and curved. In preservative, the colour of the back is dark brownish; the abdomen is light grayish. Pelvic and anal fins are light yellowish. It resembles morphologically most closely Sinocyclocheilus yishanensis known from the Liu River, another river in the Pearl River system. Both have \\"normal\\" body shape, in contrast to some other Sinocyclocheilus species showing humps or horns. Ecology and behaviour Virtually nothing is known about the ecology and behaviour of this species. It shares its habitat (and type locality) with another cave fish species, Sinocyclocheilus altishoulderus. Habitat and conservation The type locality, near Gongping Village, Taiping Town, Donglan County, is a subterranean river some 10‚Äì20 metres inside from the mouth of a small cave. During the rainy season, the water can extend outside the cave to form a small lake. The habitat is potentially threatened by water extraction, waste disposal and pesticide pollution, and landscape alterations in general.

Located in Nicholson Township west of the borough of Smithfield, it was once occupied by a village of the Monongahela people. Location The Deffenbaugh Site occupies a saddle between two low hills; its elevation is approximately , while the hills rise to approximately . Rising in a valley immediately southeast of the site is a spring that feeds York Run; via Georges Creek, this stream is a tributary of the Monongahela River. Land in the vicinity of the site is a mix of cleared and wooded areas; the site itself is clear of trees.DeLorme. Pennsylvania Atlas & Gazetteer. 8th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2003, 85. . Profile Like other Monongahela villages, the Deffenbaugh Site is believed to consist of the remains of circular houses built around a central plaza and surrounded by a defensive stockade. Like many other Monongahela villages, the site occupies a location atop a ridge; this location was likely chosen for its defensive value, as the Monongahela were a warlike people who frequently fought among themselves. The residents may have been related to those of villages excavated in Somerset County to the east, who produced pottery similar to that found at Deffenbaugh. Additionally, the site may be related to other sites in Fayette County; while pottery samples for identification purposes are lacking, it is known that at least two other Monongahela villages occupied hilltops within of Deffenbaugh. Excavations The first study of the Deffenbaugh Site, published in 1931, reported the excavations of local archaeologist George Fisher, who recorded the discovery of bone beads and the burial of a child. After this minimal investigation, the next work at the site was carried out in the 1960s by Donald Tanner of the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. His test excavations revealed pottery, bits of bones, and shells, as well as the remnants of a tramway. A further study, conducted in 1980, revealed that the tramway had significantly damaged part of the site. Despite this disturbance, it was rated to be in fine condition overall; because surface mining has disrupted wide areas of Fayette County, sites such as Deffenbaugh are extremely rare and thus of great value. In 1984, the Deffenbaugh Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its information-yielding potential.

Ancient Rome Roman society is largely viewed as hierarchical, with slaves (servi) at the bottom, freedmen (liberti) above them, and free-born citizens (cives) at the top. Free citizens were themselves also divided by class. The broadest, and earliest, division was between the patricians, who could trace their ancestry to one of the 100 Patriarchs at the founding of the city, and the plebeians, who could not. This became less important in the later Republic, as some plebeian families became wealthy and entered politics, and some patrician families fell on hard times. Anyone, patrician or plebeian, who could count a consul as his ancestor was a noble (nobilis); a man who was the first of his family to hold the consulship, such as Marius or Cicero, was known as a novus homo (\\"new man\\") and ennobled his descendants. Patrician ancestry, however, still conferred considerable prestige, and many religious offices remained restricted to patricians. A class division originally based on military service became more important. Membership of these classes was determined periodically by the Censors, according to property. The wealthiest were the Senatorial class, who dominated politics and command of the army. Next came the equestrians (equites, sometimes translated \\"knights\\"), originally those who could afford a warhorse, who formed a powerful mercantile class. Several further classes, originally based on what military equipment their members could afford, followed, with the proletarii, citizens who had no property at all, at the bottom. Before the reforms of Marius they were ineligible for military service and are often described as being just barely above freed slaves in terms of wealth and prestige. Voting power in the Republic was dependent on class. Citizens were enrolled in voting \\"tribes\\", but the tribes of the richer classes had fewer members than the poorer ones, all the proletarii being enrolled in a single tribe. Voting was done in class order and stopped as soon as a majority of the tribes had been reached, so the poorer classes were often unable even to cast their votes. Allied foreign cities were often given the Latin Right, an intermediary level between full citizens and foreigners (peregrini), which gave their citizens rights under Roman law and allowed their leading magistrates to become full Roman citizens. While there were varying degrees of Latin rights, the main division was between those cum suffragio (\\"with vote\\"; enrolled in a Roman tribe and able to take part in the comitia tributa) and sine suffragio (\\"without vote\\"; unable to take part in Roman politics). Some of Rome's Italian allies were given full citizenship after the Social War of 91‚Äì88 BC, and full Roman citizenship was extended to all free-born men in the Empire by Caracalla in 212. Women shared some basic rights with their male counterparts, but were not fully regarded as citizens and were thus not allowed to vote or participate in politics. Contemporary Italian social structure A hierarchy of social class rank in Italy today. :1. Bourgeoisie (10% of the working population) includes high-class entrepreneurs, managers, politicians, self-employed people, highest-ranking celebrities, etc. :2. White-collar middle class (17% of the working population) includes middle class workers not employed in manual work. :3. Urban petite bourgeoisie (14% of the working population), is mainly made up of shopkeepers, small-business entrepreneurs, self-employed artisans etc. :4. Rural petite bourgeoisie (10% of the working population) consists of small entrepreneurs or estate owners who operate in the countryside, mainly in agriculture and forestry. :5. Urban working class (37% of the working population) refers to the people employed in manual work. :6. Rural working class (9% of the working population) consists of people operating in the primary industry, such as farmers, loggers, fishermen etc. References ","title":"Social class in Italy"},{"id":"25793362","text":"El Affroun ÿßŸÑÿπŸÅÿ±ŸàŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÑŸäÿØÿ© is a town and commune in Blida Province, Algeria.

He is the first man to have won the Arnold Strongman Classic and the World‚Äôs Strongest Man contest in the same calendar year, a feat he accomplished in 2011 and then replicated in 2015. Early life Shaw was born in Fort Lupton, Colorado, on February 26, 1982, the son of Jay and Bonnie Shaw. Both of his parents were taller than average, with his father standing at and his mother . It has been noted that he had uncles of exceptional stature. At Fort Lupton High School, Shaw excelled in basketball. He then attended Otero Junior College in La Junta, Colorado. There, he was able to form an inside combination with current Louisiana State University-Alexandria Head Women's Basketball Coach Bob Austin. Shaw was one of the team leaders for the Rattlers in his sophomore season. Following Otero, he went to Black Hills State University where he was on a full basketball scholarship and received a degree in wellness management. During his basketball career, Shaw was \\"hooked on the weights\\" and he has said that the weight room was his \\"sanctuary\\". In his own words, \\"I've always been able to do this. The biggest tire, the heaviest stone... I've always been able to walk up and lift it. Odd strength is what it is, not weight-room strength. It's brute strength.\\" Career=2005‚Äì2006 Shaw began his career as a strongman with a win when he entered the Denver Strongest Man contest in October 2005. He had entered with no formal training. Just seven months later in June 2006 he joined the professional ranks and his successes continued. 2009 In 2009 he entered Fortissimus, otherwise known as the Strongest Man on Earth competition, in Canada where he came in third and was the only man to lift six Atlas stones weighing from . He then competed in Romania in the World Strongman Super Series. In September he travelled to his second World's Strongest Man contest in Valletta. There he was grouped in what was termed the \\"group of death\\" not least because of his presence in it. Alongside him in this group was Zydrunas Savickas who went on to win the title. Although Savickas won the group he and Shaw were separated by just two points. In the final Shaw went on to attain a podium finish, something Randell Strossen of Ironmind had predicted would happen when he said \\"he has to be considered a favorite for a podium position. If he can stay healthy, there's no end to what he could do. He's got these gifts. He's the total package.\\" 2010 Shaw qualified for the finals at the 2010 World's Strongest Man in Sun City, South Africa in September 2010. He was tied for the lead at the end of the finals with Zydrunas Savickas and lost by countback, a system of scoring based on how the athletes placed in each event throughout the finals. Savickas had higher overall placings (2 first places and 1 second place out of 6 events) than Shaw (2 first places and 1 fourth place out of 6 events) and won the 2010 title. Shaw competed against Savickas again in October 2010 at the Giants Live Istanbul contest. Shaw again finished second behind Savickas. Shaw won the inaugural J√≥n P√°ll Sigmarsson Classic on November 21, 2010. Shaw won the Strongman Super Series Swedish Grand Prix and became the 2010 overall Super Series champion on December 18, 2010. This was Shaw's second consecutive overall Super Series championship. 2011-2013 In 2011, Shaw once again participated in the World's Strongest man competition. Going into the final event, the Atlas Stones, Shaw was tied with two-time champion Zydrunas Savickas. Shaw beat Savickas taking 1st place. In the 2013 competition, Shaw led Savickas into the final event (again the Atlas Stones) and again beat Savickas to win the competition. 2015‚Äì2016 Shaw also won the 2015 and 2016 World's Strongest Man competitions. Shaw during the 2017 Arnold Strongman Classic 2017 In 2017, Shaw competed in both the World's Strongest Man and Arnold Strongman Classic, Shaw would then go on to finish in 1st at the Arnold Strongman Classic but later in the year coming in at 3rd place with Eddie Hall defeating him by coming in at 1st place. 20182018 Arnold Strongman Classic= In March 2018 Shaw competed in the 2018 Arnold Strongman Classic. Shaw placed 2nd in Event One: The Bag Over Bar, 4th in Event Two: The Stone Shoulder, 2nd in Event Three: The Timber Carry, 3rd in Event Four: The Rogue Elephant Bar Deadlift, and was tied for 1st in Event Five: Apollon's Wheel leaving Shaw in 2nd place overall with 42 points to Bjornsson's 45.5 =World's Ultimate Strongman= In October 2018 Shaw competed in the World‚Äôs Ultimate Strongman competition in Dubai. Shaw struggled with some of the events including the dead lift where he had trained with a different bar height and the yoke walk where the stage cracked under the combined weight of Shaw and the yoke, causing Shaw to briefly drop the yoke and increase his time. Shaw still performed well, lifting all the objects in the overhead medley and was separated from Hafthor Bjornsson by less than one point going into the sixth and final event. In the sixth and final event, the Atlas Stones, Shaw lifted all five stones but this was not enough to surpass Bjornsson in the final points tally, leaving Shaw in second place. In other media Shaw has a YouTube channel, SHAWSTRENGTH, which has videos of training footage, fitness and strength challenges, and eating challenges. Eddie Hall, is also seen occasionally on his videos. Shaw also was one of four strongmen to be featured in the History Channel series, The Strongest Man in History, which premiered on July 10, 2019. On the first episode of the show, he pulled a viking ship on a incline course in 44.05 seconds.

He was convicted for involvement in an attempted coup against military head of state General Sani Abacha in 1997, and was on death row when Abacha died in June 1998. He was subsequently pardoned. Military career Abdulkareem Adisa was born in Ilorin, now in Kwara State. As a Lieutenant during the Nigerian Civil War, he was captured by Biafran forces in August 1967, and was detained until January 1970. Abdulkareem Adisa was appointed military governor of Oyo State in August 1990 by the head of state, Major-General Ibrahim Babangida, holding office until January 1992. While governor of Oyo State, Adisa erected a statue of the unknown soldier in front of government house, Ibadan. This statue was destroyed and replaced with a statue of Obafemi Awolowo by Governor Lam Adeshina. The second statue was pulled down a few days after Governor Adeshina left office. Minister of Works & Housing  General Sani Abacha, who became head of state in November 1993, appointed him Minister of Works and Housing. He investigated the conduct of his predecessor at the ministry, Alhaji Lateef Kayode Jakande, and absolved him of any wrongdoing. He continued the National Housing Policy initiated by Lateef Jakande, which planned to build affordable units across Nigeria, but more than doubled the price of each type of house. During his term of office, deposits for the houses were used to award contracts for infrastructure to the sites. As a result, many years later a considerable number of depositors had not got houses or refunds of their deposits. Adisa directed that the Federal School of Surveying should channel the evolution from analogue to digital methods. Coup attempt and trial In December 1997, Abdulkareem Adisa was arrested on charges of participating in a coup attempt against General Sani Abacha, along with Lt-General Oladipo Diya, Major-General Tajudeen Olanrewaju and others. He was tried and found guilty on 28 April 1998. In June 1998, he was on death row when Abacha died suddenly. In March 1999, Nigeria's outgoing military government granted state pardons to Adisa and the others convicted of the coup attempt. Later career After the return to democracy in 1999, Adisa ventured into publishing with a paper The People's Advocate based in Ilorin. The paper was the target of a N250 million libel action from the Kwara State Governor, Mohammed Lawal, which was later withdrawn. In 2003, Adisa said he would not accept a pardon from President Olusegun Obasanjo, who had himself participated in a coup attempt in 1995. In April 2004, he was active in the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara State. One PDP group suspended the Minister of State for Women Affairs, Miss Funke Adedoyin, but another group of PDP elders, led by Adisa, voided Adedoyin‚Äôs suspension. Adisa also became vice-chairman of the Kwara Progressive Movement (KPM). Adisa was leader of a movement to elect General Ibrahim Babangida as president in 2007. He published an attack on the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) in The Guardian of 28 April 2004, warning the group not to try to prevent the Babangida's presidential election. He said the Yoruba would vote for Ibrahim Babangida despite his role in annulling the 12 June 1993 presidential election won by the Chief MKO Abiola. Adisa died in a London hospital in February 2005 from injuries sustained in a car accident. His body was returned for burial in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital on 27 February 2005, in a ceremony attended by many prominent people including three former state governors and former General Ibrahim Babangida. On 23 June 2009, President Umaru Yar'Adua granted a presidential pardon to Abdulkareem Adisa and others convicted of treason for the Sani Abacha coup attempts.

NWJRCF reports directly to the United States Army Corrections Command in Alexandria, Virginia.  Mission statement  The Northwestern Joint Regional Correctional Facility provides custody/control, education and vocational opportunities as well as behavioral mental health programs of prisoners in an effort to assist their transition back into the civilian community or return to duty. On order, prepare individual soldiers to deploy and conduct full-spectrum operations.  Organization structure The NWJRCF consists of primarily of Army Soldiers assigned to the 508th Military Police Battalion, 42nd Military Police Brigade. These Soldiers are joined by several members of the Navy assigned to the sub base in Bangor who serve as the liaisons for their respective service personnel incarcerated within the facility and also assist in the daily operations of the facility. The staff is rounded out Navy Department and Army civilians.  History  The Fort Lewis Regional Corrections Facility (RCF) was activated in March 1957 as an Installation Detention Facility (IDF) to specifically satisfy the post's short term confinement and those transfers to the United States Corrections Brigade at Fort Riley, KS or the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, KS. During the Vietnam War the facility was managed by personnel from the 18th Military Police Company (Escort Guard), 392d MP Bn, 2 MP Gp. The Company personnel were supplemented by soldiers from units assigned to Ft. Lewis which raised the company headcount to upwards of 270 guard personnel. Not until the commencement of the Vietnam War did the IDF population began to regularly exceed 50 Army prisoners although many times prior it was well over that amount. The IDF was officially established as a Regional Corrections Facility on 20 June 1984. As the number of Desert Storm unit deployments increased, the Acting Commander, I Corps & Fort Lewis approved the activation of a Provisional Battalion Headquarters to assume command of rear detachment units. When officially activated on 30 November 1990, the Garrison Troop Support Battalion (GTSB) assumed command of 15 rear detachment commands. The IDF commander was designated the commander of the GTSB. On 1 May 1991, the IDF was reorganized as a Regional Corrections Facility to support Army commands and activities in the Western United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Korea. The facility operated a wide variety of correctional and employment programs to support prisoners from all military departments within the Department of Defense. In October 1992, the GTSB was inactivated and the battalion was redesignated as the Law Enforcement Battalion consisting of the Correctional Holding Detachment, B Company (garrison law enforcement) and C Company (corrections). On 30 March 1993, Department of the Army redesignated the Law Enforcement Battalion as the 704th Military Police Battalion. The battalion was activated, reorganized, and redesignated as the 508th Military Police Battalion (Internment/Resettlement) 16 October 2005 at Fort Lewis, Washington, and deployed in December to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 508th Military Police Battalion (I/R) was constituted on 29 July 1921 in the Organized Reserves as the 308th Military Police Battalion. The battalion was withdrawn from the Organized Reserves on 1 January 1938 and allotted to the Regular Army. The battalion was redesignated on 1 June 1940 as the 508th Military Police Battalion. The battalion was activated on 20 March 1944 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and arrived in the European Theater in December 1944. It initially served in England where in January 1945, it was transferred to the newly formed 15th Army. In mid-March, the 508th was moved to France and attached to 1st Army. The battalion participated in the final drive of the allied armies into Germany performing traffic control, operation of straggler control points, and suppression of violence between Russian and Polish displaced persons and German Civilians in and around the area of Dueren, Germany. The battalion was reorganized and redesignated 20 October 1947 as the 508th Military Police Service Battalion. During 1945‚Äì51 the battalion and its subordinate companies were located in the Stetten Kaserne, Dachau Strasse, responsible for law and order operations in the locale and on the Munich and Garmisch Military Posts. The battalion was inactivated 1 July 1964 in Germany, and reactivated 25 August 1967 at Fort Riley, Kansas. Companies A, B, C, and D were inactivated 1 November 1970, followed by the Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment on 29 March 1973. In October 2008, the Regional Corrections facility was realigned under the Army Corrections Command. On 30 April 2009, the memorandum of agreement between all services as directed by BRAC 2005, established the partnership with the Consolidated Naval Brig Miramar Detachment Puget Sound, as the Northwestern Joint Regional Correctional Facility. In the second half of 2019, it was announced that the NWJRCF would be demolished for the construction of a new facility to be built on the same site. A ceremony to commemorate the closure of the (old) NWJRCF and celebrate the groundbreaking for the (new) NWJRCF facility was held on 3 March 2020.

It was discovered in 1857 by http://arthistorians.info/francoisa and Adolphe No√´l des Vergers. It dates to the last quarter of the fourth century BC. The tomb seems to belong to the Etruscan family of the Saties (or Seties) and one of its chief occupants is Vel Saties, who appears with his dwarf, Arnza. Its outstanding frescoes are significant both iconographically and also in terms of their comments on Etruscan history and identity. Vel Saties, wearing the toga picta, and Arnza The tomb contains a fresco depicting Caelius Vibenna (whom the Romans believed the Caelian Hill was named after) and Mastarna (a legendary figure whom the Emperor Claudius identified with Servius Tullius). The tomb paintings include a representation of 'Marce Camitlas' (Latin equivalent 'Marcus Camillus') about to draw his sword against a crouching 'Cneve Tarchunies Rumach' ('Gnaeus Tarquinius of Rome'). The ancient histories of Rome do not include any reference to a 'Gnaeus Tarquinius'. The frescos were removed by Prince Torlonia soon after their discovery and were kept in the Torlonia Museum (Rome). Since 1946, they have been stored at the private Villa Albani in Rome as part of the Torlonia collection.

They are Rohingya Muslims (), an ethnic group native to Rakhine State, Myanmar (also known as Arakan, Burma), who have fled their homeland because of the persecution of Muslims by the Burmese government and Buddhist majority. According to varied Pakistani government sources and the Arakan Historical Society, there are some 200,000 Rohingya refugees residing in Pakistan. All of them have made a perilous journey across Bangladesh and India and have settled in Karachi. A report on human trafficking stated that Burmese people make up fourteen percent of Karachi's undocumented immigrants. Large scale Rohingya migration to Karachi made Karachi one of the largest population centres of Rohingyas in the world after Myanmar. In the recent years, scores of Burmese women seeking employment have entered the country. Different resources cite the number of these women to be in the thousands.  Rohingyas and Bengalis in Karachi  According to community leaders and social scientists, there are over 1.6 million Bengalis and up to 400,000 Rohingyas living in Karachi. There are numerous Burmese housing colonies that can be found throughout Karachi. Traditionally, cultural similarities of the Rohingya people to those of Bengalis has enabled easier communication and interaction of the Burmese in Karachi with the Bengali community. Their native Rohingya language furthermore has dialect familiarities especially with the Bangladeshi natives hailing from Chittagong, who speak a somewhat indistinct Chittagonian language. As a result of the great inter-ethnic engagement, the Burmese people in Pakistan have a special reputation for being found in areas only that traditionally also contain a Bengali population. With more stringent control and difficulty in traversing borders the Burmese have now started travelling east to countries closer to Myanmar such as Thailand, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Malaysia.

Giovanni Battista Caproni, 1st Count of Taliedo (July 3, 1886 ‚Äì October 27, 1957), known as \\"Gianni\\" Caproni, was an Italian aeronautical engineer, civil engineer, electrical engineer, and aircraft designer who founded the Caproni aircraft-manufacturing company. Early life and education Caproni was born on July 3, 1886 in Massone, which at the time was in Austria-Hungary but became a part of Italy in 1919. In 1907 he received a degree in civil engineering from the Technical University Munich. A year later he received a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from the University of Li√®ge. Career In 1907 and 1908, Caproni gained experience in the construction of aircraft engines; he also collaborated with the Romanian aircraft designer Henri CoandƒÉ, whom he had met at lIstituto Montefiori di Liegi, in the building of sailplanes. In 1908, he founded the Caproni factory in the Taliedo district of Milan, Italy, to manufacture biplanes. In 1909 he opened an industrial airport near the Cascina Malpensa - today's Milan‚ÄìMalpensa Airport - to manufacture and test his aircraft. In 1910, he designed and built his first powered aircraft, the Caproni Ca. 1, an experimental biplane which was the first aircraft built in Italy. It was destroyed during its first flight on May 27, 1910. In 1911, the year his company was named Societ√† de Agostini e Caproni, he switched to monoplane construction, in which he had greater success. In 1914, he tested Italys first multi-engined aircraft, a three-engine biplane later dubbed the Caproni Ca.31 . After Italy entered World War I in 1915, he devoted his efforts to designing and constructing bombers. His company later was renamed Societ√† Caproni e Comitti. Caproni was an early proponent of the development of passenger aircraft, and developed a variant of the Ca.4 bomber into the Ca.48 airliner. Although it made a very favorable impression on the public when first displayed, the Ca.48 probably never entered airline service, and on August 2, 1919, a Ca.48 crashed near Verona, Italy, killing everyone on board (14, 15, or 17 people, according to various sources) in Italys first commercial aviation disaster and one of the earliest ‚Äì and, at the time, the deadliest ‚Äì airliner accidents in history.The civilian transport aircraft of Caproni (1918‚Äì1939) Flight, August 7, 1919, p. 1053, at flightglobal.comGuttman, \\"Crazy Capronis,\\" Aviation History, July 2008, p. 55. In 1921, he built the prototype of a giant transatlantic passenger seaplane, the Caproni Ca.60 Noviplano, with a capacity of 100 passengers, but it proved unstable and crashed on its second flight. He also designed gliders. Between World War I and World War II, he devoted most of his effort to the design and production of bombers and light transport aircraft, and his company manufactured the early Stipa-Caproni and Caproni Campini N.1, the ducted fan experimental aircraft which were precursors of true jet aircraft. During this period, his company became Societ√† Italiana Caproni, a major conglomerate which purchased other manufacturers, creating subsidiaries which included Caproni Bergamasca and Caproni Vizzola, although the assertion that Caproni also purchased the Reggiane company to form a \\"Caproni Reggiane\\" subsidiary is a myth.Green, William, and Gordon Swanborough.

The Caproni company produced aircraft for the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) during World War II ‚Äì primarily bombers, transports, seaplanes, and trainers, although the Caproni Vizzola subsidiary also built several fighter prototypes. The Societ√† Italiana Caproni conglomerate ceased operations in 1950, although its last vestige, the Caproni Vizzola subsidiary, survived until 1983. Death and legacy Caproni died in Rome on October 27, 1957. His remains were transferred to his hometown of Massone where he was buried in the Caproni family grave.

Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 12th century. The manuscript contains text of the four Gospels with unusual grammar forms and numerous errors. Textually it does not belong to any of the main text-types, and is a member of the textual family Family 13, known also as Ferrar Group. The lacunose manuscript is housed at the University of Michigan.  Description = Contents  The codex contains the text of the four Gospels, on 184 thick parchment leaves (size ), with several lacunae (Matthew 12:11-13:10; Mark 8:4-28; Luke 15:20-16:9; John 2:22-4:6; 4:52-5:43; 11:21-47). One leaf was misplaced in binding. The parchment is coarse and yellowed by age. The text of the codex was written two columns per page, 27-30 lines per page, 17 letters per line, in minute hand, in brown ink. The same scribe wrote all four Gospels. There are breathings and accents used in regular form, but in some sort of system. There is not found iota subscript, iota adscriptum occurs very often (especially in Mark).Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener, Adversaria Critica Sacra: With a Short Explanatory Introduction (Cambridge, 1893), p. XIX. The titles to the Gospels of Matthew and Mark run: .In this way are also titled the headings of the Gospels in Minuscule 69, 178, 668. The titles to the Luke and John are usual: . The lists of the (chapters) are placed before every Gospel, numbers of the are given at the left margin, with their (titles) in red at the top of pages. There is a division according to the Ammonian Sections, with a references to the Eusebian Canons. It contains lectionary markings, Synaxarion, Menologion, subscriptions, , and .

Rendel Harris, The Origin of the Leicester Codex of the New Testament (London, 1887), pp. 62-65.  Nomina sacra and OT quotations  The nomina sacra are contracted in the usual way, but there are a number of words which the scribe failed to abbreviate. In some of the cases where nomina sacra are uncontracted, they have the heavy bar signifying contraction. œÖŒπŒøœÇ is contracted only once (John 4:47). On the other hand, it gives unusual abbreviations: for œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœâœÉŒøŒΩ (crucify) the manuscript has œÉœÑœâœÉŒøŒΩ, for œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœâŒ∏Œ∑ ‚Äî œÉœÑœÅœâŒ∏Œ∑, (virgin) is contracted to œÄŒ±œÅŒΩŒøœÇ.Jacob Geerlings, Codex 543, University of Michigan 15 (Gregory 543; von Soden Œµ 257), in Six Collations, pp. 28-29.

Errors  Almost all the necessary corrections of misspellings have been made. Sometimes a stroke of the pen indicates an error, perhaps to be corrected later. Some corrections seem to be written by prima manu (e.g. Matthew 4:10; 5:19) others plainly secondary manu (Matthew 6; Luke 3; 10:35). The apostrophe is used even when not required, especially in ŒµŒæ', and ŒøœÖŒ∫'. According tŒø Scrivener movable nu occurs 416 times especially with words , . In Matthew 12:7; Luke 8:10; John 5:46; 7:7; 8:27 there is a hiatus for lack of it. The error of iotacism occurs 358 times: ŒµŒπ for Œπ (16 occurrences), Œπ for ŒµŒπ (35), Œø for œâ (40), œâ for Œø (33), Œ±Œπ for Œµ (13), Œµ for Œ±Œπ (31), ŒµŒπ for Œ∑ (23), Œ∑ for ŒµŒπ (19), Œ∑ for Œπ (11), Œπ for Œ∑ (7), Œµ for Œ∑ (11), Œ∑ for Œµ (2), ŒøŒπ for Œπ (3), œâ for ŒøœÖ (20), Œ∑ for œÖ (3), œÖ for Œ∑ (5), œÖ for ŒøŒπ (1), œÖ for ŒµŒπ (1), Œ∑ for ŒøŒπ (1), ŒøŒπ for Œ∑ (1), Œπ for œÖ (1), ŒøŒπ for ŒµŒπ (2). There are many errors by homoioteleuton (Mark 2:18; 4:24; 12:26; 14:70; 15:14; Luke 12:22.47; 13:28.29; John 4:14). There are some unusual forms like: .  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Caesarean text-type. It belongs to the textual family f13, known also as Ferrar Family. Also the handwriting and the menology show that is a close member of the group.Jacob Geerlings, Codex 543, University of Michigan 15 (Gregory 543; von Soden Œµ 257), in Six Collations, p. 26. According to Kurt and Barbara Aland it agrees with the Byzantine standard text 151 times, and 72 times with the Byzantine when it has the same reading as the original text. It agrees 31 times with the original text against the Byzantine. It has 57 independent or distinctive readings. Alands placed it in Category III. According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents the textual family f13 in Luke 1, Luke 10, and Luke 20, as a core member. The Pericope Adulterae follows Luke 21:38, like in other manuscripts of the Ferrar Family. ; Textual variants The words after the bracket are the readings of the codex (before the bracket are readings of Textus Receptus). * Matthew 1:18 and 1:23 ‚Äî ŒµŒΩ Œ≥Œ±œÉœÑœÅŒπ (pregnant, literary in womb) ] ŒµŒ≥Œ≥Œ±œÉœÑœÅŒπ (inwomb) * Matthew 5:48 ‚Äî ŒµŒΩ œÑŒøŒπœÇ ŒøœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩŒøŒπœÇ (in heavens) ] ŒøœÖŒΩŒπŒøœÇ (heavens) * Matthew 6:24 ‚Äî ŒºŒ±ŒºŒºœâŒΩŒ± (mammona) ] ŒºŒ±ŒºœâŒΩŒ± (mamona) * Matthew 7:2 ‚Äî Œ±œÄŒø (from) ] ŒµŒ∫ (from) * Matthew 8:4 ‚Äî ŒúœâœÉŒ∑œÇ (Moses) ] ŒúœâœÖœÉŒ∑œÇ (Moses) * Matthew 8:8 ‚Äî Œ¥ŒµŒπŒΩœâœÇ (terrible) ] Œ¥ŒµŒπŒΩŒøœÇ (terrible) * Matthew 8:8 ‚Äî ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒøœÇ (worthy) ] Œ±ŒæŒπŒøœÇ (worthy) * Matthew 8:26 ‚Äî œÑŒøŒπœÇ Œ±ŒΩŒµŒºŒøŒπœÇ (winds) ] œÑœâ Œ±ŒΩŒµŒºœâ (wind) * Matthew 9:17 ‚Äî Œ±œÄŒøŒªŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ (ruined) ] Œ±œÄŒøŒªŒªŒøœÖŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ (ŒùŒë27 has Œ±œÄŒøŒªŒªœÖŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ) * Matthew 9:17 ‚Äî Œ±ŒºœÜŒøœÑŒµœÅŒ± ] Œ±ŒºœÜŒøœÑŒµœÅŒøŒπ (both) * Matthew 11:5 ‚Äî Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅŒøŒπ ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒπœÅŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄœÑœâœáŒøŒπ ŒµœÖŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒπŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ (and the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them) ] Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄœÑœâœáŒøŒπ ŒµœÖŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒπŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅŒøŒπ ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒπœÅŒøŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ (and the poor have the gospel preached to them and the dead are raised up) * Matthew 26:39 ‚Äî ] œâœÜŒ∏Œ∑ Œ¥Œµ Œ±œÖœÑœâ Œ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÇ Œ±œÄŒø œÑŒøœÖ ŒøœÖŒΩŒøœÖ ŒµŒΩŒπœÉœáœÖœÉŒøŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ ŒµŒΩ Œ±Œ≥œâŒΩŒπŒ± ŒµŒ∫œÑŒµŒΩŒµœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∑œÖœáŒµœÑŒø ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒµœÑŒø Œ¥Œµ Œø ŒπŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ œâœÉŒµŒπ Œ∏œÅŒøŒºŒ≤Œ∑ Œ±Œ∏ŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ≤Œ±ŒπŒΩŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ ŒµœÄŒπ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ≥Œ∑ŒΩ * Mark 1:9 ‚Äî ŒùŒ±Œ∂Œ±œÅŒµœÑ (Nazaret) ] ŒùŒ±Œ∂Œ±œÅŒµŒ∏ * Mark 1:10 ‚Äî Œ±œÄŒø ] ŒµŒ∫ * Mark 1:10 ‚Äî ŒµŒ∫ (from) ] ŒµŒπœÇ (to) * Mark 2:4 ‚Äî Œ∫œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒΩ ] Œ∫œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÑœÑŒøŒΩ (bed)  History  J. Rendel Harris pointed out that the menology of the Ferrar group contains saints which appear to be peculiar to Calabria or Sicily.Rendel Harris, Further Researches into the History of the Ferrar Group, 1900. Abbe Martin had previously stated that certain palaeographical traits to be observed in these manuscripts were characteristic of Calabrian scriptoria. The Lady Burdett-Coutts Of the history of the codex 543 nothing is known until the year 1864, when it was in the possession of a dealer at Janina in Epeiros. It was then purchased from him by a representative of Baroness Burdett-Coutts (1814‚Äì1906), a philanthropist, together with other Greek manuscripts (among them codices 532-546). They were transported to England in 1870-1871.Robert Mathiesen, An Important Greek Manuscript Rediscovered and Redated (Codex Burdett-Coutts III.42), The Harvard Theological Review, Vol. 76, No. 1 (Jan., 1983), pp. 131-133. The manuscript was presented by Burdett-Coutts to Sir Roger Cholmely's School, and was housed at the Highgate (Burdett-Coutts III. 5), in London.F. H. A. Scrivener, Adversaria critica sacra (Cambridge, 1893), pp. XVI-XVII. In 1922 it was acquired for the University of Michigan.Kenneth W. Clark, A Descriptive Catalogue of Greek New Testament Manuscripts in America (Chicago, 1937), p. 294. It is currently housed at the University of Michigan (Ms. 15) in Ann Arbor. Scrivener observed a close textual affinity to the Ferrar group and announced in 1883 in the third edition of \\"Plain Introduction\\" (p. 236) as portaining to the same class.F. H. A. Scrivener, A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament, Third Edition, Vol. 1 (1883), p. 236. Scrivener collated its text and it was edited posthumously in 1893.F. H. A.

The player takes the role from any of the playable characters to defeat other characters before SurRaider, a powerful warrior from another dimension, attempts to conquer the Earth and add it to his vast empire. Originally announced on January 1995, Thea Realm Fighters was one of the many fighting games developed in response to Mortal Kombat and the series' popularity during the 1990s, featuring digitized graphics and characters, with some of them portrayed by known martial artists from the Mortal Kombat series and even the plot bears striking resemblance to Mortal Kombat II. After several delays and expenses, Atari Corporation cancelled the game in January 1996, a decision that was seen by the video game press as an indication that the company was preparing to drop support of the Jaguar, particularly as one of the other games, Black ICE\\\\White Noise, was also cancelled at the same time. The game was close to completion before it was cancelled, according to one of the game's programmers. Although never released, various playable prototypes of the game have been showcased at multiple Jaguar-dedicated festivals such as the JagFest 2K1. In 2016 and 2017 respectively, several ROMs were leaked online by video game collector Nicolas Persjin.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot from one of the released beta builds. Thea Realm Fighters is a two- dimensional fighting game with digitized characters and graphics, featuring more than twenty-five playable characters, each one with four special moves and two finisher moves, four different gameplay modes with over 30 stages. In the single-player mode, the player has to defeat twelve CPU-controlled opponents and after doing so the player was going to face SurRaider, a powerful warrior from another dimension.  History  The game was unveiled during the January WCES 1995, where the game was reported to be unpolished and too early to judge, with spectacular backgrounds and lackluster character animation. Only four characters were available at that time, with only one featuring special moves. The game was also known internally as SurRaider's Galactic Challenge. It was also playable at E3 1995, with several more characters and stages available. In a Slashdot post, a former programmer of the project stated that the game was 90% close to completion, before Atari Corporation cancelled it alongside other upcoming Jaguar projects in 1996.  Characters  The game was going to feature over 25 fighters to play against, including twelve starting fighters, 12 special fighters, various hidden sub- bosses, the final boss and five hidden fighters. Characters known from the available screenshots online and press coverage include: * Billie Bobcat * Chan Ho * Draccar * Electrika * Fyrina * Jack * Neptar * Onyx * Peace * Prince Pak * Renegade Marshall * Royal Marshall * Sakura * Shadow * Soldier X * Sparq * SurRaider * Surreal * Tok * Velocia  Cast  At least four martial artists were known to be involved in the development of the game. There were also other 20 martial artists involved in the game as well. Some of them are: * Ho- Sung Pak, who played Liu Kang and Shang Tsung in the Mortal Kombat series (he also served as technical advisor for the choreography of the game) * Philip Ahn M.D., who previously played Shang Tsung in Mortal Kombat II * Katalin Zamiar, who previously played Kitana, Mileena and Jade in Mortal Kombat II * Daniel Pesina, who played Johnny Cage and the ninjas in the Mortal Kombat series ReferencesExternal links * Thea Realm Fighters at GameFAQs Category:1995 video games Category:Atari games Category:Cancelled Atari Jaguar games Category:Fighting games Category:High Voltage Software games Category:Mortal Kombat clones Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with digitized sprites ","title":"Thea Realm Fighters"},{"id":"25793944","text":"Forzzaea warasii is a plant species in the genus Forzzaea.

Cobb (December 26, 1797 ‚Äì February 26, 1876) was a farmer, businessman, and philanthropist from Barnstable, Massachusetts. He is known locally for bequeathing in his will land that would help to benefit public school students of the town. Biography An attendant of the public school system, he married a local woman and had 4 children. Three of the children died in infancy, while the fourth became a Harvard University graduate and a surveyor. His son died at age 24 and two wives predeceased him. Cobb was a local businessman and farmer, and he co-ran the local general store. He also owned eight woodlots in town which he would later leave to the town upon his death. Trust fund=Early years In his will, Cobb left 100 plus acres of woodlots to the town. He specified in his will that a trustee would be appointed to run the fund. The will called for the raising of funds for the trust to be accomplished by cutting the wood on the land and selling it at public auction. Once the money accumulated to $10,000, the income would be used to buy school books. A trustee for the fund would then be appointed at a town meeting. After the town accepted the terms of the will, they would have to abide by it. The next town meeting after the creation of the trust, voters approved the trust and they also appointed Isaac Davis as the first trustee. After he died, the fund fell into the hands of his son, until he too died in 1932. Disuse Sometime after 1932, the state of Massachusetts passed a law that mandated that schools provide textbooks for their children. The fund also fell out of use after the 1932 death of its trustee because the town did not appoint someone to take their place. As a result, land was rented out for fees ranging between a dollar to one hundred dollars a year. In addition, part of the land on the nearby Barnstable Municipal Airport was used to build a runway. In 1981, plans were brought about which would include the expansion of Runway 15/33, something which abutted the trust fund's land. This brought up the issue of what should be done with the fund, as it became relevant in town politics again. During this time, it was also revealed that the local Veterans of Foreign Wars headquarters was also located on trust land. Revival Town attorneys then revealed plans to put the trust back on track. Local attorney David Cole was suggested to the selectman by another local attorney. Cole started showing interest in the fund in the mid-1970s, and he was one of the few people to actively support change of the fund's purpose. A lawsuit was then brought against the town over the fund. The office of state Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti also became involved as the fund had been seriously misused over the years. The suit was brought in the local probate court. The result of the lawsuit was for a new plan to be developed on how to run the fund. The presiding judge also undid the leases, invalidating them because they were signed by selectman not the trustee. A new plan of operation for trust was adopted after Cole and the assistant attorney general created the plan. The Cy-pr√®s doctrine was used to redevelop the trust fund as the original plans of the will would be hard to follow since selling cords of wood was not as profitable as it once was. As the trustee of the fund, Cole increased the funds from the $10,233 that had existed since 1932 to the over four million dollars that it is at today. The land that was planned for the expansion was then sold to the airport to help to raise further cash for the fund. Trust today Today, there are around of land remaining in the fund out of the original plus. Around 2005, there were plans to build affordable housing on of the remaining land. There are over four million dollars left in the fund, and the income of the trust is used for grants. The monies from the fund are not to be used for regular budgetary things, otherwise the use of the fund would be defeated. In 2003, the trust offered over $125,000 in grants to the children of the school district alone.

Milk or cream may be added to make a lemon cream liqueur. Lemon juice is not used to alter the taste and affect the stability of the lemon liqueur. Production To produce the Lemon liqueur requires sugar, water, lemon zest, liquor, and time to mature. Lemon zest is soaked in high proof neutral spirits to extract from it the lemon oil (an essential oil). The extraction is then diluted with simple syrup.  Variations  Different varieties of lemon are used to produce different flavors. The variety of lemon used is usually dictated by region. Various alcohols can be used to give distinct flavors. A higher proof alcohol maximizes extraction of the lemon flavor, whereas darker alcohols add complexity of flavor.

The tax is associated with the financial sector and is a type of financial transaction tax, as opposed to a consumption tax paid by consumers, though the tax may be passed on by the financial institution to the customer. Types of currency transaction taxes Currency transaction taxes have been proposed as taxes on domestic currency usage as part of the automated payment transaction (APT) tax and on international currency transactions, the Tobin tax and the Spahn tax.  APT tax The automated payment transaction (APT) tax was first proposed in Buenos Aires at the International Institute of Public Finance Conference by Edgar L. Feige in 1989 and an extended version of the proposal appeared in Economic Policy in 2000. The APT tax proposal is a generalization of the Keynes taxKeynes, J.M. (1936). The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Harcourt Brace, New York, NY. and the Tobin tax. The APT tax consists of a small flat tax levied on all transactions. The tax is automatically assessed and collected when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking or payments system. In order to assure that all cash transactions are also taxed, the APT system proposes to exact a tax on currency as it enters and leaves the banking system. In order to be an effective means of discouraging currency usage for tax evasion, the APT tax imposes a tax rate on currency higher than the rate automatically charged on cheque transactions. Since cash can be used multiple times between the time it enters into circulation and the time it is returned to the banking system, the APT currency transaction tax is set at a multiple of the rate charged for all other transactions using non cash payment methods. Tobin tax A Tobin tax is a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another. Named after the economist James Tobin, the tax is intended to put a penalty on short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency. Tobin suggested his currency transaction tax in 1972 in his Janeway Lectures at Princeton, shortly after the Bretton Woods system effectively ended. Spahn tax In 1995, Paul Bernd Spahn suggested an alternative involving \\"a two-tier rate structure consisting of a low-rate financial transactions tax, plus an exchange surcharge at prohibitive rates as a piggyback. The latter would be dormant in times of normal financial activities, and be activated only in the case of speculative attacks. The mechanism allowing the identification of abnormal trading in world financial markets would make reference to a \\"crawling peg\\" with an appropriate exchange rate band. The exchange rate would move freely within this band without transactions being taxed. Only transactions effected at exchange rates outside the permissible range would become subject to tax. This would automatically induce stabilizing behavior on the part of market participants.\\" On June 15, 2004, the Commission of Finance and Budget in the Belgian Federal Parliament approved a bill implementing a Spahn tax. According to the legislation, Belgium will introduce the Spahn tax once all countries of the eurozone introduce a similar law.ECB (2004). Opinion of the European Central Bank (CON/2004/34) In July 2005 former Austrian chancellor Wolfgang Sch√ºssel called for a European Union Tobin tax which he thought would base the community's financial structure on more stable and independent grounds. However, the proposal was rejected by the European Commission. Special Drawing Rights On September 19, 2001, retired speculator George Soros put forward a proposal, special drawing rights or SDRs that the rich countries would pledge for the purpose of providing international assistance, without necessarily dismissing the Tobin tax idea. He stated, \\"I think there is a case for a Tobin tax... (but) it is not at all clear to me that a Tobin tax would reduce volatility in the currency markets. It is true that it may discourage currency speculation but it would also reduce the liquidity of the marketplace.\\" Evaluation=Impacts In 1994, Canadian economist Rodney Schmidt noted that \\"in two- thirds of all the outright forward and currency swap transactions, the money moved into another currency for fewer than seven days. In only 1 per cent did the money stay for as long as one year. While the volatile exchange rates caused by all this rapid movement posed problems for national economies, it was the bread and butter of those playing the currency markets. Without constant fluctuations in the currency markets, Schmidt noted, there was little opportunity for profit.\\" \\"This certainly seemed to suggest the interests of currency traders and the interests of ordinary citizens were operating at cross-purposes.\\" \\"Schmidt also noted another interesting aspect of the foreign- exchange market: The dominant players were the private banks, which had huge pools of capital and access to information about currency values. Since much of the market involved moving large sums of money (typically in the tens of millions of dollars) for very short periods of time (often less than a day), banks were perfectly positioned to participate. Among swap transactions, which represented a major chunk of the foreign exchange market, 86 per cent of the transactions were actually between banks.\\" A representative of a ‚Äúpro Tobin tax‚Äù NGO argued as follows: \\"[The Tobin tax] is designed to reduce the power financial markets have to determine the economic policies of national governments. Traditionally, a country‚Äôs central bank buys and sells its own currency on international markets to keep its value relatively stable. The bank buys back its currency when a ‚Äòglut‚Äô caused by an investor selloff threatens to reduce the currency's value. In the past, most central banks had enough cash in reserve to offset any selloff or ‚Äòattack‚Äô. However, this is no longer the case. Speculators now have more cash than all the world's central banks put together. Official global reserves are less than half the value of one day of global foreign-exchange turnover. Many countries are simply unable to protect their currencies from speculative attack.\\" \\"By cutting down on the overall volume of foreign-exchange transactions, a Tobin Tax would mean that central banks would not need as much reserve money to defend their currency. The tax would allow governments the freedom to act in the best interests of their own economic development, rather than being forced to shape fiscal and monetary policies according to demands of fickle financial markets.\\" Implemented of a Tobin tax In early November 2007, a regional Tobin tax was adopted by the Bank of the South in Latin America, after an initiative of Presidents Hugo Chavez from Venezuela and N√©stor Kirchner from Argentina.SIN PERMISO - art√≠culos en la WEB Chronology * 1972 - Supporter: James Tobin, author of a \\"tax on foreign exchange transactions\\",James Tobin-El movimiento antiglobalizaci√≥n abusa de mi nombre which was later dubbed \\"Tobin tax\\" * June, 2000 - Thomas Palley publishes \\"Destabilizing Speculation and the Case for an International Currency Transactions Tax\\" * April 1, 2001 - Supporters: Peter Wahl and Peter Waldow publish \\"Currency Transaction Tax - a Concept with a Future\\" * In 2001 the charity War on Want released The Robin Hood Tax,The Robin Hood Tax a report presenting their case for a currency transactions tax.

It can be made by either weaving or knitting. Waffle weave is a further exploitation of plain weave and twill weave which produces a three-dimensional effect. The combination of warp and weft floats creates the structure. It is woven partly on tabby areas surrounded by ridges of long floats. The weave consists of warp and weft floats arranged around a plain weave center. The warp and weft threads are interlaced and floating in a way that creates small square ridges and hollows in the fabric in a regular pattern. The surface of the fabric has a texture that looks like the food called a waffle, hence the name. An example of waffle fabric Waffle fabric can also be made on a double jersey knitting machine by selecting the needle position for knitting and tucking the loops for the formation of the structure similar to floating warps and weft in weaving. The knitted waffle can be produced in two variants big waffle and mini waffle, it is also known as thermal fabric.  Characteristics  The \\"face\\" is a weaver's term that refers to whether the warp or weft dominates the fabric.

The Authority was created under the provisions of Act 784 by the South Carolina General Assembly in 1954 to provide services to Beaufort County. In 1969, its powers were expanded to include wastewater facility construction and services. In 1983, the authority merged with the Jasper County Water and Sewer Authority and thus adopting the BJWSA moniker. Although initially set up to provide water and wastewater services to unincorporated areas, BJWSA has over time acquired municipal water and sewer systems for Beaufort, Port Royal, Bluffton, and Hardeeville. Since 2008, BJWSA also provides water and service to the military installations located in northern Beaufort County. In 2009, BJWSA assumed ownership of the former Port Royal Railroad right-of-way in northern Beaufort County. The railway was decommissioned and removed in order to allow BJWSA to use the right-of-way for future utility routing and to create the Spanish Moss Trail. The authority is governed by an eleven-member board appointed by the Governor of South Carolina. A general manager is in charge of day-to-day operations of the authority and oversees the various departments and functions of BJWSA. The Authority's headquarters is located near the border of Beaufort and Jasper counties, between Beaufort and Bluffton along S.C. Highway 170 in the Okatie area. The major fresh-water source for BJWSA is the Savannah River, approximately eight miles north of downtown Hardeeville. An eighteen-mile canal carries freshwater from the river to the BJWSA facility for treatment purposes. The authority operates two water treatment plants, three wastewater treatment plants and hundreds of pump stations. BJWSA has approximately 45,000 retail accounts for water services and approximately 28,000 for wastewater services. BJWSA treats an average of 20 million gallons of water for consumption and 7 million gallons of wastewater each day.
