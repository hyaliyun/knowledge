The campaign would spur industrialization in Cuba and focus the economy on sugar production, specifically to a deadline for an annual sugar harvest of 10 million tons by 1970. The economic focus on sugar production involved international volunteers and the mobilization of workers from all sectors of the Cuban economy. Economic mobilization also coincided with greater militarization of Cuban political structures and society in general. By 1970 production in other sectors of the Cuban economy had fallen, and the predicted 10 million ton annual harvest fell short to only 8.5 million. The failure of the 1970 harvest caused officials to reassess the Cuban economy, sacrificing egalitarian measures and embracing Soviet influence. Background By 1965 Cuba was officially a One-party state after a long period of political solidification by Fidel Castro after the Cuban Revolution. In September 1966 Fidel Castro gave a speech to representatives of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. In the speech he gave his ruling that workers would no longer receive material bonuses for extra labor and instead be encouraged by moral enthusiasm alone, which distanced Cuba from the soviet model of using material incentives. This independent approach to economic policy fell into a global trend in the Cold War in which Third World countries adopted independent economic strategies in relation to the industrialized dominant power blocs. Cuba had begun what was refereed to as the \\"Radical experiment\\", where the country was to be reorganized to promote revolutionary consciousness and an independent economy. Rural to urban migration was regulated, excess urban workers were sent to the countryside, and agricultural labor became common for students, soldiers, and convicts. The Military Units to Aid Production were established and used \\"anti-social\\" prisoners as penal laborers in agriculture. In February 1968 a group in the Communist Party of Cuba and other official organizations known as the \\"microfaction\\" were purged from government. The group numbered almost 40 officials who endorsed soviet-style material incentives over moral enthusiasm to encourage workers. They were accused of conspiring against the state, and made to serve prison sentences. Events=Implementation In March 13, 1968 on the eleventh anniversary Havana Presidential Palace attack, Fidel Castro announced plans to nationalize all remaining private businesses in Cuba, thus ushering in the Revolutionary Offensive. The nationalizations would be the first step in the larger economic mobilization of the country to achieve an annual sugar harvest of 10 million tons by 1970. Alcohol sales would be outright banned. Nightclubs and bars were closed and their closures would be justified via official accusations that they were epicenters of prostitution, homosexuality, and crime. The Cuban government would also outright ban self-employment, farmer's markets, and private gardens on state farms. In total the nationalized enterprises included 17,000 food retailers, 2.5000 industrial product merchants, 11,3000 bars and restaurants, 9,600 small workshops, and 14,000 barbers, laundries, and other retail shops. All production in Cuba would be organized using civil defense structures, where workers would be organized into squadrons, platoons, and other military brackets and be commanded by the military command post in their region. Workers were often moved to temporarily live in work stations outside their cities. The government implemented the Youth Centennial Column, composed of volunteers from the Young Communist League, to work in the countryside. By August 1968 around 350,000 workers, soldiers, students, and peasants were deployed to work in agriculture. In April 1968 plans were implemented for CDRs to monitor parents and reward them for following official parenting protocols. During this time policies regarding youth began changing. Work programs and vocational schools for \\"maladjusted\\" students were created. Officials also warned that those embracing a hippie lifestyle could be rounded up and sent to jails or labor camps for their accused lazy behavior. Reactions Many Cubans were overcome with a fierce passion to accomplish the planned economic goals, and government officials saw this as evidence that moral enthusiasm alone could incentivize workers into better production. With the elimination of many niche artisans the state often never filled the void of their services and their economic sectors often became under-served. With this unexpected economic downturn the Cuban government initiated new policies militarizing labor forces. Some of the small merchants whose enterprises were nationalized would decide to leave Cuba in the airlift active at the time. With the total erasure of small enterprises the black market was severely reduced, however barter transactions still continued in the rural countryside. Many Cuban students failed to embrace new government promoted consciousness. In a 1968 survey of people in the Centennial Youth Column, only 17 of the 35 students gave \\"revolutionary\\" reasoning for joining, others gave reasons such as avoiding conscription, or to leave home.

Rakoshino is located 7 kilometers from Mukachevo. It has a population of 3,280. http://www.tiptopglobe.com/city?n=Rakoshyno&p;=3145, 20 Aug 2020 History History of Rakoszyno Translated from the Ukrainian http://translate.google.com, 20 Aug 2020. According to legend, the name of the village Rakosh (Rakove) comes from the word \\"crayfish\\", many of which were found in the old bed of the river Latorytsia, which ran through the village. In some written sources, the village is also called Beregrakosh (ie Rakoshin Berezky), because it belonged to the Berezka Committee. The area where the villages of Rakoshinskaya village council are located has been inhabited since ancient times. Stone tools of the Neolithic era (IV-III centuries BC) were found in the area of Kaidanov and the vicinity of Rakoshin. In written sources the village is mentioned in 1330. In written sources the village is mentioned in 1332 as Rakus. As early as 1427, the inhabitants of Rakoshin and other villages fought against the transfer of their lands to Brankovych. In 1463, he and the peasants of Ianoshiev (Ivanivka) protested against the attacks and violence of the Irshava feudal lord Ladislav Karachoni. In 1514 they took part in the peasant war! Authorities sent regular troops to suppress the protests. Authorities built barracks to house parts of the castle cavalry in the village. The village had a church in the Middle Ages, which was already in 1737 in ruins. In 1645 there was the Rakoczi estate, destroyed by the Poles in 1657. The Reformed Church was built in the neoclassical style between 1836 and 1844 and was restored in 1981. In the XVII century. the village was owned by the Semigrad princes, in particular the Rakoci family. Changes in the owners of the village, their quarrels led to increased enslavement of peasants, to delay the development of the village. During the war, men were drafted into the army. The serfs were obliged to pay numerous monetary and in-kind duties. In addition to numerous dues, the peasants performed various works on construction and repair in the manor or in Mukachevo Castle, carried security, transported various things and so on. During the invasion of Transcarpathia by the Polish - noble army in 1657, the estate of the Rakoci in Rakoshin was destroyed. However, the rulers forced the peasants to quickly rebuild it, and in 1684 it was completely reconstructed. In addition to feudal exploitation, the peasants suffered religious and national oppression. The Greek Catholic religion was forcibly imposed on the Ukrainian population, which recognized Orthodoxy; the Hungarian population suffered from the Catholic Church and converted to Protestantism. After the conquest of Transcarpathia by the Austrian Habsburgs, the situation of the masses worsened. The serfs still barely survived, suffered from shortages, and were also robbed by stationed German troops. This, first of all, explains the active participation of many peasants of Rakoshin in the liberation war of the Hungarian people in 1703-1711. There were more than 40 people of Rakoshin and neighboring villages in the detachments of chickens. After 1728, Rakoshino, like the entire Mukachevo-Chinadiyev dominion, passed into the hands of Count Schönborn. In the XIX century, according to T. Lehotsky and J. Sternberg, the community of Rakoshin (village of Mukachevo district of Berezka County) used a seal with the image of cancer (which reproduced one of the legends about the origin of the name of the village). On March 22, 1919, the period of Soviet occupation began in the village. However, the Bolshevik occupation lasted 39 days. On April 29, 1919, Rakoshino was occupied by Romanian troops. And in May they were replaced by Czechoslovak troops. During the years from the First to the Second World Wars, Rakoshino has hardly changed. Most of the houses were wooden, the streets were untidy. On March 15, 1939, the village was occupied by the Nazis. Dark days began for the people of Rakoshyn. Gendarmes were stationed in the village. National oppression intensified. The Ukrainian language was expelled from school, and it was forbidden even to speak it in government institutions. Terror, torture and persecution forced many young men and women to flee to the Soviet Union. In 1940, 29 people illegally moved from Rakoshyn to the USSR. Rakoshintsy refused to fight against the Soviet Union. On October 26, 1944, the troops of the 4th Ukrainian Front liberated Rakoshino. Many of Rakoshin's youth joined the Red Army and took part in the final defeat of the Nazis. M.Doktor, V.Krupka, I.Kogutych, Y.Glagola and others from Rakoshyn went to Berlin with battles. On November 17, 1944, the villagers called for the reunification of Transcarpathia with Soviet Ukraine. Their elected representatives Dmytro Kovach and Petro Varha voted for the reunification of Transcarpathia with the USSR at the First Congress of the People's Committees of Transcarpathian Ukraine. Religion Church of St. arch. Michael. 1833 In the XVII century. the majority of the population were Protestants. In 1682 the church received a plot allocated by the landlord. In 1733 the wooden church of St. Michael. In 1798 there is a mention of an old wooden church in poor condition. In 1833 a new plot of land for the construction of a church was donated from the count's lands, and building materials were also provided. In 1834 an additional plot of land was provided for the parish near the newly built church. In 1839, the houses of the deacon and the priest were exchanged, as a result of which the lighthouse was in its present place. In 1937, a stone cross was erected on the site where the old church (or churches) stood from 1576 to 1833. The stone church is a typical for the neighborhood one-nave basilica, built after Fr. Mykola Bachynsky. At the end of the XIX century. Mykola Golovchak painted the interior. The wooden chandelier was made by Vasyl Lendel and Yuriy Logoyda. In 1996, Myron Kurtseba from Rusky repainted frescoes and icons. The bell tower was built of metal and concrete in 1935, when the church was renovated by the efforts of the parish priest Mykola Tovt. Three bells were cast by the Uzhhorod firm \\"Akord\\" in 1933 for the 100th anniversary of the church. The bells were consecrated by Bishop O. Stoyka on the feast of St. St. Michael's 1935. Several wooden crosses have been destroyed near the church.

Munsell received his country's highest award for bravery during combat, the Medal of Honor, for actions taken over the course of 13 engagements from July 1–3, 1863 during the Battle of Gettysburg. Civil War service Munsell enlisted with the 32nd Pennsylvania (lateral renumbered the 99th) in Philadelphia at age 18. He had been managing a lumberyard for his uncle in Oil City, Pennsylvania at the time the Civil War began, and enlisted in the Union Army due to his opposition to slavery. Due to his short stature, and reported to be only 100 pounds, Munsell was turned away at all enlistment sites along the way from Oil City until he reached Philadelphia, where there was such a high demand for volunteers that his small size was overlooked. He was enlisted as a private, and was made color-bearer. Munsell first saw action during the Peninsula campaign, where he charged a Georgian line with his flag encouraging his men to follow and drive back the Confederate advance. His next battle was the Battle of Chancellorsville from May 2-3, 1863. During this battle, Munsell and his unit were tasked with clearing from the woods a group of Confederate soldiers for which they received the Kearny Cross. Munsell was next at the Battle of Gettysburg, the 99th situated at the Devil's Den on the left flank of General Ward's brigade. During the ensuing battle, Munsell misunderstood commands to fall back with his company and found himself exposed to Confederate fire. A cannon shell burst nearby causing him to hit the ground and fall into a cavity made by a previous shell explosion. Here, he remained until the Sixth Corps pushed back the Confederate advance and he was able to return back to his unit. Following this action, Major John W. Moore, commander of the 99th, made a special note of Munsell's actions, calling it \\"worthy of the most decided approval\\". Further commendations were sent to the Secretary of War by General J. H. Hobart Ward. Following Gettysburg, Munsell took part in the Battle of Kelly's Ford, the Battle of Mine Run, and the Battle of Manassas Gap. He then received an extended furlough to attend the Free Military School in Washington, D.C., where he left as a First Lieutenant. He then rejoined his regiment and took part in the Battle of Cold Harbor, the Siege of Petersburg, and the Second Battle of Deep Bottom. In the latter fight, Munsell was captured and held as a prisoner of war until his release in 1865. He returned to his company yet again, now as a Captain.

The multi-award winning book tells the story of Daniel Ellsberg's role in the Vietnam War and the Pentagon Papers. Overview The book begins by telling the reader about how two members of The Plumbers are preparing to break into the office of a psychiatrist named Lewis J. Fielding, in an attempt to dig up dirt on his former clients, Daniel Ellsberg, and hopefully ruin his reputation. Like a few other books by Sheinkin, it then backtracks many years, telling the reader why the government would be inclined to do such a thing. The book explains how Ellsberg got a job at the RAND Corporation, how he left to work at The Pentagon, how the Pentagon Papers were created, how Ellsberg became an anti- war advocate, and how Ellsberg accessed and released the Pentagon Papers. It often veers off Ellsberg, and tells the reader what was happening in the White House before and during the Vietnam War. The book closes off with the court cases involving the printing of the Pentagon Papers in the New York Times and Washington Post, and the case in which Ellsberg was tried for violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Reception Reviews of the book were overwhelmingly positive. In a starred review, Booklist says that \\"Sheinkin offers a fascinating portrait\\" of Ellsberg. They add that it is both \\"thorough and challenging\\" and \\"powerful and thought-provoking.\\" Publisher's Weekly starts off its starred review by saying that \\"Sheinkin...has done again what he does so well: condense mountains of research into a concise, accessible, and riveting account of history,\\" that \\"read[s] like the stuff of spy novels and will keep readers racing forward.\\" A starred Kirkus review calls it \\"Lively, detailed\\" and \\"fully documented\\" before proclaiming the book to be \\"Easily the best study of the Vietnam War available for teen readers.” Its fourth starred review, given by VOYA, calls it \\"Fast-paced and fascinating\\" and \\"backed up by meticulous research.\\" Another starred review was handed out by School Library Journal, stating that the book is \\"Thoroughly researched...and beautifully written.\\" The Horn Book slaps down a sixth star, and says the book is so good, Sheinkin \\"has outdone even himself.\\" The stars continue with one from Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, which calls Most Dangerous a \\"thrilling ride.\\" The Washington Post declined to give a star, but did inform their readers that Most Dangerous is \\"Sheinkin's most compelling yet.\\" The New York Times followed suit in the lack of a star, but did call the book \\"gripping\\".

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The design is most likely a catboat-rigged derivation of the Mills-designed Windmill of 1953. Production The design was initially built by Kuppersmith's company, the Advance Sailboat Corporation of Parkville, Missouri and later of Independence, Missouri, United States. That company went out of business in 1980 and the boat design was then built by Continental Sailcraft. A total of 450 boats were completed, but it is now out of production. Design The US1 is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a catboat rig with a loose-footed mainsail and foam-filled aluminum spars to reduce the risk of turtling. The hull features a rounded foredeck, a plumb stem, a vertical transom, a transom-hung, kick-up rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable centerboard. It displaces . The boat has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer or car roof rack. For sailing the design is equipped with a dual Cunningham and an outhaul. The class rules allow specific modifications to the boat, including the installation of two bailers, centerboard gaskets, four inspection ports, changes to the sheeting, the boom vang, the Cunningham, mainsheet traveler, outhaul, as well as the rudder and tiller and the centerboard control lines. At one time the class rules allowed the use of a three-piece mast as an alternative to the standard two-piece mast, but this change was repealed. The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 91.5 and is normally raced with a crew of one or two sailors, who are limited by the class rules to total weight.

A politico-religious leader considered in 2020 one of the most influential people in Mali, though he has never run for public office, Dicko served as mediator between the Malian government and jihadist groups in the north of the country. After supporting Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta in the 2013 election, he started supporting the opposition in 2017. On 7 September 2019, he started his own movement called Coordination of Movements, Associations and Sympathizers (Coordination des Mouvements, Associations et Sympathisants, CMAS). In 2019 and 2020, he called for several important demonstrations against President Keïta.  Biography  Dicko is Fulani. A former Arabic professor, trained in Saudi Arabia and Mauritania, Dicko became imam of the Salam mosque of Badalabougou in the early 1980s. A quietist Salafi, he considers himself a Sunni and not a Wahhabite. He was secretary general of the Malian Association for the Unity and Progress of Islam (Association Malienne pour l’Unité et la Progrès de l’Islam; AMUPI).. Dicko rejects jihad and the most violent rules of Sharia law. He also views as important Mali's pre-Islamic traditions.. In 2009, he opposed the draft personal and family code proposed by the government and with the mobilization of his followers succeeded in eliminating provisions of the code that were favorable to women's rights. In 2012, during the Mali War, he took a stand in favor of dialogue with Islamists and met with Iyad Ag Ghali, the leader of Ansar Dine. In 2013, he stated that the intervention of the French army in Mali, in support of the Malian army against armed jihadist groups, was not an aggression against Islam, saying that France had come to the aid of a people in distress, who had been abandoned by Muslim countries to their own fate. During the 2013 Malian presidential election, he supported the candidacy of Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. In November 2015, after a terrorist attack on a Bamako hotel, Dicko stated on VOA that the terrorists were sent by God to punish Mali for the promotion of homosexuality, which had been imported from the West. In December 2015, at the Grand Mosque of Bamako, he stated that jihadism was a creation of the West and of France with the goal of \\"recolonizing Mali\\". On 30 October 2016, Dicko announced that he had received, after eight months of discussions, a letter from Iyad Ag Ghaly in which Ag Ghaly announced \\"the end of attacks throughout the territory\\". But Ansar Dine denied these statements on 2 November. After having supported Keïta, Dicko moved to the opposition around the end of 2017. At his urging, 30,000-50,000 people demonstrated against the government in Bamako on 5 April 2019. On 7 September 2019, as others speculated about his presidential ambitions, he launched CMAS, a political movement that follows his Islamist line. As his influence grew, some analysts viewed him as a contender to win Mali's presidency in the 2023 election. In June 2020, the CMAS united with the 5 June Movement/Gathering of Patriotic Forces (Mouvement du 5 juin / Rassemblement des Forces Patriotiques, M5-RFP). According to Aly Tounkara's analysis, \\"Many opponents who would have had no chance of gaining power have decided to rely on the imam and his thousands of followers, giving him great political power\\". On 19 June 2020, he organized a demonstration of tens of thousands of faithful and supporters to ask the President, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, to resign. On 10 July, during the third day of mobilization, clashes occurred, causing several deaths; leaders of the opposition coalition were arrested and then released. On 18 August, during a coup d'état, Keïta and the Prime Minister, Boubou Cissé, were arrested by a military garrison. A few hours later, the President of the Republic, still detained by the army in a military camp, announced his resignation as well as the dissolution of the government and of the Parliament. On 19 August, Dicko announced that he was leaving politics.

She was a pioneer of the revolutionary Bais Yaakov girl's education movement. She taught teachers in Poland and then led a Jewish school of girls, which was evacuated throughout the war to the small town of Shefford. Life Grunfeld was born in Budapest in 1902, but she was educated and raised in Frankfurt where she attended the Hirsch Real Schule before going on to Frankfurt University. Judith Rosenbaum (later Grunfeld) on a fund raising trip for the school in Krakow It was Rabbi Jacob Rosenheim of Agudat Yisrael who persuaded her to abandon her dreams of going to Palestine, but to go to Krakow and join Sarah Schenirer fledgling school that was trying to teach girls from Jewish backgrounds. Schenirer had no great education but she was to change the way that women were regarded within Jewish culture. They aimed to teach girls and their teachers and get them to appreciate their culture and religion. For five years from 1924 she was involved with teaching teachers at the Beit Yaakov teachers' Seminary. She also had to raise the funds and this would involved some travel. In 1929 the school was adopted by the Orthodox \\"Agudat Yisrael\\" now that Rabbi Jacob Rosenheim was its President. The Beit Yaakov teachers' Seminary in Kraków today She married lawyer Isidor Grunfeld on 22 November 1932. He was a lawyer in Würzburg until 1933. When the Nazis' rise to power prompted them to move to Israel, but finding no work there they moved to London. In London she was employed at the girls' Jewish secondary school and by 1934 she was the head teacher. The school had been running since 1917, but two years after she started the board of education refused to recognise the school. Grunfeld's leadership led to improvements and new buildings were found for her school and the boys school. In 1938 to 1939 a large number of refugees arrived in the UK and Grunfeld's school gained a share and by the outbreak of war the school had 450 pupils. Three days later the whole school was evacuated north to the town of Shefford in rural Bedfordshire. The school was to remain in Shefford until 1945. She and her husband moved to Bedfordshire and her husband would commute to his job leading the Jewish court (London Beth Din). In 1943 their fourth child was born. In 1947 she was said to have surprised the school when she gave birth to her fifth and last child as no one was aware that she was pregnant. In 1954 a heart attack led to her husband's early retirement from the London Beth Din, but he would continue to write. The following year Judith retired to start twenty years of caring for him, although she still gave talks internationally. He died in 1975. In 1980 she published \\"Shefford: The Story of a Jewish School Community in Evacuation, 1939-1945\\", telling the story of her time leading the evacuated school. Death and legacy Grunfeld died in London Borough of Hackney in 1998 and she was buried in Jerusalem beside her husband.

Coastline was recognized for its world-weary but hopeful songs inspired by extensive travels.

The next few years were reserved for extensive touring in Europe and North America with artists like Fakear. Dozens of performances and almost 40,000 miles travelled. The following two years marked an emotional period for Geoffroy, defined by further world travel, creative trials and most significantly, the loss of his mother who succumbed to a long battle with Cancer during the writing process.

Early life and family Alexander Strain was born around 1877 in Markethill, County Armagh. His parents were builder Robert Douglas and Margaret Strain (née McFadden). He was their eldest son. Strain moved to Dublin in 1893, where he was employed at a timber dealership in Rathmines. He married Kathleen Parr in 1898,Civil Records, Marriage certificate of Alexander Strain who was from Dublin. They had 4 daughters, Madge, Belinda, Caroline, and May. He was a Presbyterian, and an active member of the church in Dublin. He served as the chair of the board of governors of Drumcondra Hospital, supported the Marrowbone Lane fund, and was a governor of the Adelaide Hospital. Strain died suddenly at home in Cremore Park on 18 September 1943. One of Strain's daughters married George Linzell, who also built many houses in Dublin from the late 1920s. Career Soon after his moved to Dublin, Strain noticed the potential to build houses on the northern outskirts of Dublin. He borrowed capital to buy 10 acres in 1896 in the areas known as Daneswell and Cross Guns. He started construction on Iona Road, Drumcondra in 1904, building to a high quality with spacious homes that were in stark contrast to the existing local housing stock. He built houses on streets including Iona Road, Iona Drive, Lindsay Road, and Lindsay Crescent from 1904 to 1914. He and his family would live in the houses he built, leading to them moving at least 16 times around the Drumcondra and Glasnevin area. The housing market went into decline during World War I, and during the Easter Rising a number of the properties Strain owned on Lower Sackville Street appear to have been damaged. He began to build again from the mid-1920s, at locations including Hollybank Road, Cliftonville Road, and the Cremore estate. Cremore was named for the townland in County Armagh that his father was from. With his family, Strain settled in Cremore Park in 1930, where he built a number of houses for his family. Strain developed a reputation for his customised houses with special features, and the high standards he maintained in the inter-war years when funds and materials were in short supply. He was also lauded for his honest business practices. While his houses were uniform from the outside, and were similar in style to others built elsewhere in the city, the interiors and some decorative exterior features were modified to the clients requirements. These customisations included glazed exterior bricks, different sill and lintel profiles, varying iron railing designs, and unique stained glass window panels in the doors. In response to changing economic and social trends in the 1920s he adapted his designs, reducing the space for servants and accommodating private cars. His houses were marketed very successfully as \\"Strain-built\\", and this has since been co-opted by estate agents as a descriptor for any high-quality home of the era in Drumcondra and Glasnevin. Roughly half of the houses on Iona Road and Lindsay Road can be definitely attributed to Strain, such as 34, 66, 68, and 76 Iona Road and 24 Cremore Park. He owned a large property portfolio, with some areas such as Tyrconnell Road and Jamestown Road, Inchicore which were developed in the 1930s. Given the lower quality of these buildings, it is unlikely he was involved in their construction. Strain was an advocate for modern town planning, and was the first chairman of the Dublin and District Housebuilders' Association after its establishment in 1932.

Asafo literally means in the local parlance war \\"sa\\" and people \\"fo\\" with the defense of the state and welfare as their primary role. They were also responsible for sanitation and roadworks, protection of state goods, local policies, conducting funeral rights, and community entertainment. The Asafo companies predate European contact. After three decades of trading in gold, ivory, and slaves with the Europeans, the Asafo company adopted their flag and used it to display designs symbolizing proverbs about security and warfare. The fighting role of the Asafo companies ended with the British colonial takeover, but their role in the ritual life of Fante villages remained.  Asafo Flag  The Posuban was the central shrine of each company, a concrete structure colorfully decorated with bright figures that served as regalia and a focus for sacrifice. In Fante, flags are called \\"frank\\" and are a key item of the Asafo regalia. A man who wishes to join the society designs a new flag and commissions its production from the local flag maker. The imagery of the flag challenges rival groups as it asserts the wealth and prowess of the company. The designs are a reflection of the importance of proverbs throughout Akan culture. The flags are used at annual festivals, funerals for company members, and other occasions and are usually hung around the shrine and a procession through the village.  Significance  Flags are still being made and used as an important part of communal life in Fante villages today. Asafo flags have been highly collectible in countries and regions outside Ghana since the 1990s due to their striking imagery.

Season With most programs having now returned from absences caused by World War I, Penn was hoping to form a new intercollegiate league with old rivals from the IHA. Harvard, the leading program at the time, elected to only keep its arrangement with Princeton and Yale. As a result, plans for the league were changed to allow Harvard to participate; instead of a conference, the league would operate in a more informal manner that would facilitate scheduling between teams as well as to certify rules that all members could accept. With those modifications, Penn was able to join the Intercollegiate Ice Hockey Association of America with five of its contemporaries, but membership was not the stabilizing force that Penn hoped it would be. Penn had originally hoped to schedule a practice game before the winter break but no arrangement could be finalized. After Christmas the team was supposed to open the season on the 7th and 8th of January, but both games were cancelled due to scheduling conflicts. In the end they were able to rope the St. Nicholas Hockey Club into a game on the 8th before playing their first intercollegiate game the following week. In February Harvard finally accepted the inevitable and agreed to play 6-on-6 hockey beginning the following year. As a result the expectation was that the Intercollegiate league that had just been formed would become a fully-formed conference in the near future. The news came amidst a good streak for the Quakers with the team going 3–0–1 and looking like they would have a chance to earn a split with Princeton, but the Tigers, who were using the Philadelphia Ice Palace as their home rink, shut down the Penn offense and won the game 2–0.

Biography Encarna Hernández was born in the Region of Murcia town of Lorca in 1917. At the age of 10 she arrived in Barcelona together with her parents and ten siblings since her father had to work at the Universal Exposition of 1929. She began practicing basketball at the age of 13 with the boys and girls of her neighborhood, on a field built by what would later become her husband, Emilio Planelles. She not only played basketball but also practiced other sports: cycling, skating ... For her the most important thing was playing sports. At 154 centimeters tall, Encarna was known as 'the girl with the hook' for her ability to use this resource. In 1931 she participated in the founding of the Atlas Club, to which her husband also belonged. Aurora Jordà and Encarna Hernández were among the most outstanding players in the women's team, with Encarna being the absolute top scorer of the club, above the men. In 1932 the Atlas Club was dissolved and its players became part of Laietà. There she would be trained by Fernando Muscat and would coincide with players from the Club Femení i d'Esports such as Maria \\"Mary\\" Morros or Carmen Sugrañes, in a team in which they won the first Catalan Women's Championship held in the 1935/36 season, winning all their matches. Encarna was selected to participate in athletics events of the Popular Olympiad, but this was not held at the outbreak of the Civil War. During the Civil War she continued to play basketball matches despite the difficulties of the war itself, these being more exhibitions than official competitions. At the end of the Civil War, she was a basketball instructor appointed by the Falange to make \\"strong and healthy women for the country.\\" Although she became a popular figure in the local sports press, it was only when she played for the Falange that she charged a modest amount of money, so she had to work hard off the court and had to combine work hours with training. After the Civil War he played for Laietà, Cottet, Moix Llambés, apart from the Women's Falange Section, teams in which his sister Maruja Hernández also played. She won championships in Spain with both Cottet and the Women's Section. In 1944 she received an offer from FC Barcelona, staying at the club until 1953, retiring from the competition at the age of 36 to be a mother. She got an offer from the Italian SEU, which she rejected. She broke barriers in the world of sports in the 1930s and was active until 1953. She was one of the pioneers of Spanish basketball, as a player, coach and referee. She was the first coach of Spain when she led the Peña García de Hospitalet team in 1932. She would lead five more teams. With a ball in her hands, trying to emulate admired heroines of the social sphere, as \\"blessed those women Victoria Kent , Clara Campoamor , Federica Montseny ...\\". She was also one of the first women in Barcelona to obtain a driving license in Franco's Spain. Her home has become a pilgrimage site for many of the basketball players. Women who have made history like Amaya Valdemoro, Elisa Aguilar or Laia Palau (from the same neighborhood of Barcelona where the lorquina lives), have come to her home to meet a woman who has a small museum in her apartment with her memories and compilations from the triumphs of women's basketball to the present.

He co-hosted The New Symposium on New York City's WBAI from 1968 to 1969, the first weekly public radio program to offer an affirming discussion of homosexuality by openly gay hosts. After the Stonewall Riots, he co-founded the Gay Liberation Front in New York City and continued his audio activism through the program Homosexual News. From 1971–73, his weekly WBAI show Out of the Slough broke barriers as the first freeform radio show centered on gay politics and culture. Early Life and Family Charles Pitts was born on July 24, 1941 in Jamestown, New York. His childhood home was at 509 Lakeview Avenue in Jamestown. His father, George B. Pitts, Jr. (1905-1997), ran Pitts Home and Garden, a home and hardware store inherited from his father. As a young man, he had been enrolled as a student of philosophy and religion at the University of Chicago, intending to become a minister or social worker, before a family crisis forced him to return to Jamestown. Driven by a social conscience, he integrated his company's workforce, introduced an innovative profit-sharing plan for his employees, and helped create the local community college. Charles recalled him as a loving, well-intentioned man who provided for his family despite his life's disappointments, and who attempted to love and accept his son while unable to understand his homosexuality and unconventional life. His mother Frances Pitts (1911-2012), was born Frances Warrington Porter in Falconer, New York. After marrying George B. Pitts, Jr. she also worked for Pitts Home and Garden, and later in life was involved in founding the Bioregional Conservancy and Reclamation Trust in Maine. Frances and George Pitts had four children, including Charles, his sisters Mary and Martha, and his brother Robert. As a student at Jamestown High School, Charles Pitts already exhibited many of the interests that he would maintain throughout his lifetime. While an honor roll student, he found time to explore many hobbies and passions; he participated in the “Lyceum” debating society, served on the editorial committee of the school yearbook, was a school PA announcer, and held the vice president role in the Radio Club. He participated in a group of students that produced a radio program broadcast weekly on local FM stations. A yearbook caption identified him as a “hard worker” with “original ideas,” interested in photography and radio electronics. After high school, Pitts was briefly confined in a psychiatric unit at Gowanda State Hospital, related to his homosexuality. After emerging from the hospital, he began to publicly acknowledge his sexuality to his family and others. Press Pass for WVOR FM in Rochester, c. 1964 Early career In the early 1960s, Pitts attended Jamestown Community College and worked at WJTN, the town's local radio station. He later studied at Alleghany College in Meadville, PA, where he hosted the college's program on a local radio station. Before moving to New York City, he held positions at several commercial radio stations around the state, including Rochester, Salamanca, and Olean. From 1965 to 1967 he worked for Cine Magnetics in Mamaroneck, NY, where he recorded audio soundtracks for sales presentations and teaching aids on 8-millimeter film, before moving to Manhattan. Move to New York City In the mid-1960s, Pitts decided to move to New York City. A major impetus for his relocation was to seek treatment from psychotherapist C.A. Tripp, whose perspective that homosexuality constituted “a difference rather than an illness” promised a route towards a more affirming self-understanding. Tripp had worked under Dr. Alfred Kinsey studying human sexuality at the Kinsey Institute, became an advisor to the New York Mattachine Society, and would gain prominence as the author of The Homosexual Matrix, a controversial but influential 1975 book critiquing psychoanalytic perspectives on homosexuality and arguing in favor of social acceptance of homosexuals. Upon arriving in Manhattan, Pitts met with Tripp, joined a therapy group of other gay men led by Wardell Pomeroy, and soon “developed a strong and positive gay identity and a deep anger at the cultural standards that for so long had kept him guilty and unhappy.” While exploring the city's gay world, Pitts also became an active participant in hippie and countercultural circles. During his early years in New York City, Pitts worked as a freelance sound engineer for a range of companies, including recording radio programs and commercials for Cinema Sound, Ltd. And museum and historical site tours for the Acoustiguide Corporation. He performed location dialog recording for various film projects, including the movies Greetings (1968), The Projectionist (1970), and Love and Kisses (1971). He also attended the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, where he worked as a sound engineer with a film crew documenting the performances. Their work would be released in the 1970 documentary film Woodstock; in addition to winning an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, the film also received a nomination for Best Sound. Charles appears briefly at 13:40 in the later Woodstock Diary feature, recording the film sound. WBAI Radio and Gay Activism As a lifelong radio enthusiast, Pitts quickly gravitated to WBAI upon moving to Manhattan, where he worked as an engineer and announcer off and on from 1967 to 1973. Longtime WBAI participant Steve Post recalled that Pitts simply wandered into the studio at some point, announcing his intention to volunteer, and by persistently showing up and taking on tasks had managed to secure engineering and announcing roles at the station. At WBAI, Pitts interacted with a range of countercultural and New Left radicals, whose convictions that “individuals could revolutionize society by thinking and acting in new ways” helped to bolster his determination to live openly as a gay man. His participation in community radio fed directly into his activism in the emerging gay liberation movement. In 1968, Pitts along with Baird Searles, Bill Weaver, and other gay men launched a weekly radio program on WBAI called “The New Symposium.” The program's stated goal was “inspiring a sense of social identification within our subculture.” In contrast to the standard practice of a previous generation of homophile activists who wrote and spoke publicly using pseudonyms, all of the gay men who participated in “The New Symposium” used their legal names. The thirty minute shows featured discussions between the hosts, invited guests, and callers, exploring a wide range of themes relevant to gay men and lesbians. Topics included couples and relationships, the leather scene, physique magazines, gay and lesbian youth, employment, hustlers, cruising, homosexuality in literature, anti-gay violence, and religion. The show became famous in the New York City area gay community, recognized by listeners for the openness of its hosts and its candid conversation on controversial topics that had rarely, if ever, been discussed in public media before. Founding of the Gay Liberation Front As historian David Carter notes, “Pitts’s position as an openly gay radio personality positioned him to take action in the immediate aftermath of the Stonewall Riots.” Shortly after the riots had taken place, SDS activist Bill Katzenberg contacted Pitts, suggesting that the two discuss creating a radical gay organization. The two arranged to meet, and Pitts invited Pete Wilson, an activist with the New York City Sexual Freedom League and a frequent guest on \\"The New Symposium.\\" During their meeting, Pitts came up with the slogan that would appear on the flyer promoting the new organization: “Do you think homosexuals are revolting? You bet your sweet ass we are!” Before the riots, Katzenberg and fellow gay New Left activist John O’Brien had already reserved space at Alternate U for a meeting on July 24. Alternate U, located on the second floor of 530 Sixth Avenue at West 14th Street in Greenwich Village, was “a free counterculture school and leftist political organizing center” and a “radical haven.” Pitts, Katzenberg, and Wilson agreed to promote the July 24th meeting as an opportunity for homosexuals to “make a place for ourselves in the revolutionary movement.” Pitts joined Katzenberg, Weaver, O’Brien, and about forty other radical homosexuals at the July 24th meeting. Lesbian writer and activist Karla Jay recalled that the crowd included “drag queens, bar dykes, street people, feminists, radical students, leftists, socialists, Marxists, Maoists, anarchists, libertarians, hippies, and former Yippies.” Pitts later recalled the early GLF meetings as “mind-bending,” marked by conflicts over purpose, methods, and strategy, and diverging over whether to focus specifically on homosexuality versus organizing as gay people to participate in the broader revolutionary movement. While participating in the GLF, Pitts continued his exploration of gay themes through radio. In 1969, the WBAI program director fired Pitts for refusing to adhere to the station's music policies. In response, Pitts called a meeting with other staffers at which he argued that the true reason for his termination lay in the fears of heterosexual staffers that the station was “being taken over by homosexuals.” Although he was not reinstated at first, he continued to spend time at the station as a volunteer until he was rehired by different staff some months later. From 1970–71, Pitts co-hosted with Pete Wilson the show “Homosexual News” on WBAI, consisting of reports on local and national current events relating to gay men, lesbians, and sexuality. “Out of the Slough” Program on WBAI In 1971, WBAI agreed to give Pitts time in the programming schedule to use for his own gay-themed freeform radio show. His new program, titled “Out of the Slough,” first aired on July 3rd, 1971. Shows centered around discussions with callers, along with Pitts’ reflections on gay life, current events, and articles from local media as well as music. The show continued until January 1973. The program provided an opportunity for many gay people to connect with others, explore ideas, and express themselves. For example, gay singer-songwriter Michael Cohen, after listening to Pitts’ show, stopped by WBAI to bring him a tape of his songs. Despite getting into “a violent ideological argument” with the young musician, Pitts nonetheless played the tape on his Saturday night show, invited him back to the station to record more tracks, and interviewed him on subsequent shows. Cohen’s first self-titled album was recorded at WBAI, engineered and produced by Pitts, including one song recorded live on the air during “Out of the Slough” in September 1972. Cohen went on to release two additional albums on the Smithsonian Folkways record label. Pitts’ show attracted controversy and condemnation from some listeners and WBAI staff. One outraged listener writing to the station in 1972 castigated Pitts as “spiteful, intolerant, and tedious, and a querulous spoiled brat to boot.” Journalist John Dalmas from the Rockland County Journal-News argued that Pitts “has a reputation for being a gay bigot—he puts down gays who don’t swing his way” and claimed that “Out of the Slough” had “done little to advance the cause of gay liberation.” WBAI producer Paul McIsaac, while considering himself both a supporter of gay liberation and a personal friend of Pitts, questioned the show’s style and expressed discomfort over the content, particularly its discussion of intergenerational sex. Despite the complaints of its critics, the show proved an important influence for a significant number of young gay men. George Plagianos, who grew up Brooklyn and would go on to become an activist in ACT- UP, remembers that after acknowledging his homosexuality but before actually meeting other gay people, he learned about gay life and politics by listening to Pitts’ show on WBAI. Victor Patin began listening to “Out of the Slough” in eleventh grade, and described how his life was profoundly changed by having Pitts “with me, guiding me, giving me strength” through his voice and the voices of the other gay young people who called and wrote in to the show. R. Paul Martin, host of WBAI’s free-form “Back of the Book” radio show, described his importance for the gay community: “By the ‘70s and ‘80s the number of gay men who acknowledged having been educated about gay male life and issues by Charles Pitts’ broadcasts was astounding.” In May 1973, Charles Pitts was again fired by WBAI manager Jerry Coffin. While he would continue to spend time at the WBAI studio and appeared as a guest on other shows, he would not host his own program on the station again. Beating and Recovery Around 4:30 AM on February 18th, 1978, Pitts was violently attacked by a stranger while waiting for a cab home in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. After spending the evening at a gay leather bar and then eating at an all-night restaurant, he was walking on 22nd Street towards 10th Avenue when an unknown man accosted him and began hitting him. Pitts did not fight back, but attempted to call for help. The attacker eventually began to walk away, but when Pitts attempted to reach a telephone booth to call for help, the man returned and resumed beating him. He lost consciousness, and was eventually transported to St. Vincent’s Hospital by a police officer, where he awoke in the emergency room. The motivation for the attack was unknown. While the attacker did not use any verbal anti-gay slurs, Pitts understood the assault within the broader context of a wave of anti-gay violence taking place in New York City at the time. As he explained in a radio interview a month after the attack, “My getting beaten up was necessary for society to continue as it is now; whoever beat me up was also playing his part. These things are necessary in order to continue the oppression of homosexuals.” Pitts’ injuries were severe, including a splintered nose, a jaw broken in several places that had to be wired together, orbital fractures around the eyes, and major swelling to his head. The damage required a week of recovery at St. Vincent’s, followed by a two week stay at Bellevue where he underwent five hours of plastic surgery. Over the course of the year he underwent five different reconstructive operations, spending 48 days in hospitals. Recovery proceeded slowly, requiring a long regimen of pain medication; he would suffer from chronic pain as a result of his injuries for years. Later Life Pitts continued to work in commercial radio through much of his time in New York City. He served as a Production Engineer at WNCN-FM from 1976 to 1991. In addition to his work miking, recording, editing, and mixing, he wrote a computer program called “Sked” to facilitate scheduling feature broadcasts. His commercial work garnered recognition through several industry awards, including sharing a Peabody Award and a Major Armstrong Award for his work on the program “Conversations with Horowitz,” and another Peabody Award for “New York City Musicbox.” In 1994, he began working at as a production engineer at WQXR until his retirement. Pitts died on May 21, 2015 from lung disease. Social and Political Beliefs=Sexual Freedom Historian Toby Marotta notes that Pitts marked an exception from the norm among early Gay Liberation Front activists, who had become politicized within the New Left and generally lacked a “strong and positive sense of identification with the gay subculture.” By contrast, Pitts and a few others were “self-taught radicals with strong libertarian biases and little experience in the organized Movement,” which informed his divergent perspective from the nascent sexual politics of the GLF radicals. While many of the young activists criticized gay male sexual culture, condemning promiscuity and anonymous sex, Pitts consistently defended and celebrated it. Pitts insisted that young people were sexual beings and deserved the opportunity to explore their erotic selves with themselves, their peers, and adults. His support for the right of younger and older people to form intergenerational sexual relationships, as he advocated in discussions on his program “Out of the Slough,” proved one of his most controversial topics, attracting significant criticism. Pitts was a practitioner and defender of S&M; and a participant in the gay leather community. While emphatically defending the validity of consensual S&M;, Pitts joined with other “radical gay sadists” in criticizing the “conservatism, consumerism, hipsterism, and outright sexism” he perceived in gay male leather and S&M; communities emerging visibly in the 1970s and exemplified by figures such as filmmaker Fred Halsted and author Larry Townsend. Consumerism Pitts was a vehement critic of consumerism, particularly its impact on gay communities. In a 1989 letter to his doctor published in the journal _And Then_ , he lamented that before the AIDS epidemic, gay men “bought into an ugly, vicious scene, where one’s value was only what could be currency in that money-culture: money itself, or saleable good looks.” In contrast to the original inclusive, counter-cultural message of gay liberation, he believed, they were “utterly consumed with what they could consume, since their freedom and equality as human beings ended with their wallet or their credit line, whichever went first.” Free Speech Pitts passionately advocated for free speech without restrictions. He put this belief into practice in his radio shows, refusing to censor himself or others even when this brought him into conflict with the FCC, station management, listeners, and friends. By the early 1980s, Pitts had become involved in the Libertarian Party.

He is commonly regarded as one of the most important Neo-Confucian thinkers in the school of Wang Yangming, along with Wang Gen. Life Wang Ji hailed from Shanyin (山陰) County in Shaoxing (紹興) Prefecture, Zhejiang. He became a student of Wang Yangming fairly early in his life, eventually numbering among one of his most important disciples, contributing important parts to their collective posthumous records of Yangming's life and thought. After Yangming's death, Wang Ji tended associate himself with the nascent members of the Taizhou school, rather than the quietist and orthodox interpretations of his master's thought. Philosophy=Beyond Good and Evil Wang Longxi interpreted his teacher's summarization of his own teachings into the \\"Four Sentences\\" into his own form, the \\"Four Nothings\\" (四無), which stated that \\"If we realize that the mind is the mind which is neither good nor evil, that intention is intention which is neither good nor evil, that knowledge is knowledge which is neither good nor evil, and that things are things which are neither good nor evil, then the mindless mind is concealed in the secret, the intentionless intention responds perfectly, knowledgeless knowledge is embodied in quiescence, and thingless things function spiritually.\\" (若悟得心是無善無惡之心﹐意即是無善無惡之意﹐知即是無善無惡之知﹐物即是無善無惡之物。蓋無心之心則藏密﹐無意之意則應圓﹐無知之知則體寂﹐無物之物則用神。) This teaching is intended to obliterate the difference between subject and object, entering the mind of no-mind. Longxi assumed that if, according to Wang Yangming, the mind is without good or evil, then all thoughts, volition, and intuitive knowing should be likewise. According to Wang Longxi, Wang Yangming said that \\"If one can realize the original substance in which there is neither good nor evil, one will know what absolute Nothing is. And then all will, knowledge, and things will emerge from Nothing. Once this is done, it settles everything. Effort is substance. This truth is simple and direct. It is neither too much nor too little. This is the secret to be passed from one mind to another.\\" Intuitive Knowledge Wang developed his teacher's concept of intuitive knowing (良知, liangzhi) into three essential aspects: solitary knowledge (獨知, duzhi), primal knowledge (乾知, qianzhi), and knowledge free or thought and action (無思無為, wusi wuwei). Longxi believed that in solitary knowledge, \\"nothing is not original. It is invisible and inaudible, and is the foundation of liang chih. It is through this foundation that appearance and invisibility (reality), substance and function, are interfused and non-differentiated.\\" Solitary knowledge knows itself without being attached to anything (including itself), it is called knowledge of the solitary. According to the Yijing, \\"To know the great beginning is primal knowledge.\\" Longxi explained that \\"One who is equipped with primal knowledge is strong, persistent, tranquil, and correct, because primal knowledge is the origin of all this.\\" Knowledge free of thought and action is pure illumination through direct spontaneity, perfect in both action and stillness, beyond being and nonbeing. These three aspects of intuitive knowledge form the base teaching of Wang Longxi. Intuitive knowing is to be distinguished, according to Longxi, from the volitional ideas and passing thoughts which make up one's ordinary perception of the universe. In this way, one may abolish all ordinary consciousness in the intuitive knowing beyond all transient thoughts, ideas, good, and evil. In the emptiness of liangzhi, expressions of good may arise, but they will inevitably pass like an echo, leaving only the void of intuitive knowing. Direct Realization For Wang Longxi, the apprehension of Nothingness and intuitive knowing occurs by means of \\"the mind of the absolute present\\" (見在心, jianzaixin), saying that \\"When the mind is in the absolute present it will be free from the departing of the past and the coming of the future, and will be unified.\\" The absolute present is the moment in the now which is beyond deliberation or thought, and is simply spontaneous action. Longxi distinguished between precosmic (先天, xiantian) and postcosmic (後天, houtian) knowledge. Postcosmic knowledge arises in the mind when there is still conceptual thinking (i.e., when the mind has not yet apprehended liangzhi). It is equivalent with making the will sincere, which Longxi characterized as Wang Yangming's teaching. Precosmic knowing is prior to conceptual thinking, pure knowing \\"which is Nothing as well as being, unexpressed as well as always expressing, beyond the distinction of good and evil, and the supreme good.\\" The only thing to be done is to let the mind stand as it is in its right position, which is actually no position, since the mind is universal being, as well as universal Nothing. The introduction of these two methods of realization, one of which is direct (precosmic) and the other provisional (postcosmic), led to Longxi's synthesis of Chan Buddhism, Daoism, and Neo-Confucian thought as individual methods of apprehending Nothingness. Criticizing the faults of postcosmic teachings, Longxi noted that their students would become inevitably attached to them, despite their provisionality. Thus, the secret key is the spontaneous functioning free of preconception or attachment and appropriate to every circumstance. In accordance with Wang Ji's doctrine of original substance, i.e., direct enlightenment, original substance must be identical with effort, realization with cultivation, and nature with effort. He concluded that, should there be even a bit of discrepancy between these, the way of unity and oneness would be lost. Influence and Criticism Wang Yangming considered Wang Ji's ideas on intuitive knowing beyond good or evil to be those of the student of keen intelligence, while the views of other students who emphasized the moral character of passing thoughts were to instruct those of lesser knowing. However, he warned Longxi that \\"You should not show your interpretation to people. You cannot readily expect from them full realization of the unity of the original substance of the mind and effort. For it is not easy to find people of keen intelligence in this world. Otherwise they will imagine an original substance in a vacuum. Whatever they do will not be genuine. They will do no more than cultivate a mind of vacuity and quietness, and will make the mistake of skipping over [not following the proper steps].\\" In general, the schools of Wang Ji and the Taizhou school of Wang Gen were the only traditions of Yangmingist thought which adapted themselves to the romantic, emotional, and sensual mood of the late Ming dynasty, which was represented by such works as the novel the Golden Lotus (among many other vernacular dramas and novels centered around passion and emotion), the poetry of Yuan Hongdao, the painting of Xu Wei, and the calligraphy of Dong Qichang. The important late Ming individualist thinker Li Zhi's philosophy was heavily inspired by the thought of Wang Yangming and Wang Ji, particularly in the form of his conception of the \\"childlike mind\\". Huang Zongxi believed that Wang Ji distorted and corrupted the teachings of Wang Yangming through addition of Chan Buddhist elements.

Formed around the old Land and Freedom Column, the unit took part in the battles of Belchite, Aragon and Segre.  History  The unit was created in June 1937, in the Aragon front, from the militarization of the Land and Freedom Column. It was also joined by elements of various origins, such as the \\"Battalion of Death\\" or former Poumists of the 29th Division. Antonio Seba Amorós was appointed to the head of the unit, while the anarchist Francisco Sener Martín was appointed political commissioner. During the first months it went through a training period. Later, the 153rd Mixed Brigade was integrated into the 24th Division of the 12th Army Corps. The unit took part in the Battle of Belchite. Stationed in the rear, in Caspe, the 153rd MB was called to intervene in the new Zaragoza Offensive. After having some difficulties, on August 28 it managed to penetrate Belchite by the Mediana road. As of September 5, the unit, together with the 32nd Mixed Brigade, was in charge of the siege of Belchite. The last resistance photos continued until the next day, when they gave up. For the next several months it remained inactive. At the beginning of March 1938, the unit was deployed in the sector of Fuendetodos-Azuara-Herrera, with a force of 2,970 people.

It was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 738–739 in its catalogues. Plot Before a backdrop of a rugged landscape, a magician conjures up various outfits from an empty glass box, and, with the aid of an assistant transforms them into a couple in 18th-century dress. Summoning two flunkeys carrying a sedan chair, the magician performs an illusion in which the couple, under cover of a shawl and the chair itself, switch places. Leading on his assistant, he sets up what appears to be a three-person variation of the same trick. However, all three of the assistants suddenly transform into the magician and the flunkeys. The magician makes the original three assistants appear and disappear, along with the sedan chair itself, before the whole company dance on once more for a curtain call. Production Méliès plays the magician in the film, which is probably based on \\"La Cage d'Or\\", an 1897 illusion he had created for his stage magic venue, the Théâtre Robert-Houdin.

The Parks=The City of Rocks National Reserve Designated as a National Reserve in 1988 and located in on the southern edge of Idaho near the Utah border (), this site is also known as the Silent City of Rocks. The park covers almost and is adjacent to Castle Rocks State Park. As its name implies, the area is notable for its rock formations and is largely composed of granitic rock; the park is a popular location for rock climbers, offering a variety of routes for climbers of different skill levels.>> At the time settlers began traveling through the area the Shoshone and Bannock tribes inhabited the region. In 1826, Peter Skene Ogden and his Snake River brigade of beaver trappers were the first Euro-Americans to note the City of Rocks. However, the lack of beavers in the area caused the area to be ignored until the 1840s, when immigrant wagon trains began traveling through the area along the California Trail during the summer migration season. In 1849, a party of settlers \\"encamped at the city of the rocks\\" on the California Trail. Visitors can see marks on rock faces from axle grease. One immigrant described seeing distant rocks and said they were like \\"water thrown up into the air from numerous artificial hydrants.\\" Since them the City of Rocks became a landmark for emigrants traveling along the California Trail and Salt Lake Alternate Trail.

The park covers an area of and has an average elevation of The area contains different volcanic formations, basalt flows, and significant lava flows, tubes, and tree molds. Areas of sagebrush, steppe, and grassland cover a total area of . An area within the preserve was named a national monument on May 2, 1924 and expanded by President Bill Clinton in 2000. It currently covers parts of Blaine, Butte, Lincoln, Minidoka, and Power counties. The park was officially named Craters of the Moon National Preserve in August 2002. The park is jointly managed by the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument Located in south central Idaho (), running along the west bank of the Snake River, this national park is home to a large collection of Hageraman Horse fossils. This paleontological site dates to the late Pliocene era and is known as the Hagerman Horse Quarry. The site contains many fossilized plants and animals and are considered some of the latest fossils from their era. In 1975, the archeological site was declared a National Natural Landmark by President Gerald Ford. The visitor center and museum for the park is in the town of Hagerman, Idaho, located on the east side of the Snake river, opposite the park. Developed locations for visitors to the monument and park are two overlook locations, one of the Snake river, and one overlooking a section of the historic Oregon Trail.

Much of Yellowstone is situated on four overlapping volcanic calderas, collectively known as the Yellowstone Caldera. This vast underground system is responsible for the volcanism and geothermal activity at the park. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is one of the last remaining large, nearly intact ecosystems in the northern temperate zone of the Earth. While the park is widely known for its geothermal landscapes, it contains a vast area of subalpine forests. Yellowstone's bison herds make up the largest bison population in the United States and are notable for being one of the few bison herds that has not been altered by inbreeding with cattle.

Early life and education Stella Nellie Runnels was born on June 12, 1918 in Ferry County, Washington to Maud/Maude Stella (née Sears) and Hiram Bagley Runnels. Her mother was enrolled as a Pine Ridge Sioux, along with her half-sister Pearl Stirk and oldest brother Raymond Runnels. Maude had previously been married to James Stirk, but he and their son James, Jr. died before 1907. Runnels and her siblings — Mary E (1908), John A. (1909), George W. (1912), Louis (1914), Juanita Elsie (1915), William Riley (1920), Josephine Myrtle (1921), Clara (1923), Hiram Jr. (1924), and Thaddeus (1927) — were enrolled with their father in the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. The children began their schooling in Keller, Washington, but when Runnels was 10, they taken from their father's farm and sent by Indian Agency officials to American Indian boarding schools. On July 9, 1936 at Davenport, Washington, Runnels married Johnnie Bray. The couple would have two sons, Kenneth Patrick and Garry Thomas Bray before they separated in 1940. She later had four other children and married Harry Leland Leach, Sr. During the 1950s, Leach was critical of the Colville tribes' involvement with the National Congress of American Indians and the NCAI's backing of investigations on Un-American activities and McCarthyism. By 1959, the couple had divorced and Leach moved to Oakland, California as part of the Indian Relocation Program. Career and activism When Leach arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area with her 6 children, she intended to go to school, but the Relocation Act required her to get a job. She joined the staff of the Peralta Hospital as a nurse's aide. She eventually was able to transfer to the night shift and enrolled at Laney College, earning her certificate as a licensed practical nurse (LPN). She began working as a nurse for Dr. David Tepper and actively worked to improve medical care for the urban Indian population in the Bay Area. Because health care for Native Americans had been removed from federal programs in 1955 and given to states to administer, lack of funding resulted in an inability for urban Indians to obtain treatment anywhere. Leach served as the chair of the Bay Area Indian Council's health and welfare section. In 1964, the Council formed a successful partnership with Pacific Hospital to initiate the first children's and \\"well-baby\\" clinic directed to American Indians in the area, known as the All-Indian Well Baby Clinic. In January 1968, as chair of the health and welfare division, Leach met with Senators Paul Fannin (Republican) and Robert F. Kennedy (Democrat) at the American Indian Center to discuss a series of issues including insufficient relocation allowances, insufficient medical funding, inadequate educational opportunities, and difficulties with draft registration. She was concerned about veterans issues, as five of her six children had served in the Vietnam War. Shortly after the meeting, in May, Leach and her children began receiving racist and threatening calls at their residence near Mills College. Their home was broken into and vandalized, and their rent was quadrupled, when their neighbors and landlord realized they were American Indians. Senator Kennedy sent aides to stay in the house overnight, as the property doors had been removed. Initially, the Leach family intended to remain in their home, but as tension continued, they moved to the East Bay area. Leach joined her son David, who was in the November 20 landing party for the Occupation of Alcatraz, on November 22, 1969. Her sons David and Gary Leach, both veterans, were participants in the standoff. She set up and directed the health clinic on Alcatraz Island and was assisted by Jennie R. Joe (Navajo) and Dorothy Lonewolf Miller (Blackfoot), as nurses, and Robert Brennan and Richard Fine, as doctors. Leach's employer, Dr. Tepper allowed her to stay on the island for three months and volunteered his services once a week. After Richard Oakes (Mohawk) left the island, Leach was one of the seven representatives selected as members of the board of directors for the Indians of All Tribes and was a spokesperson for the board. The goals of the council were to establish a Native American center on Alcatraz to promote cultural study, as well as training in spiritual and ecological matters from an indigenous perspective. Leach stressed the importance of American Indians being able to determine their own future. In 1970, Leach also participated in the founding of the National Indian Women's Action Corps, an empowerment organization for Native American women. The organizing officers included Dorothy Lonewolf Miller, president; Grace Thorpe (Sac & Fox), vice president; Leach, 2nd vice president; Woesha Cloud North (Ho-Chunk), secretary; Henrietta Whiteman (Cheyenne), treasurer; and Jennie Joe, sergeant-at-arms. When the occupation ended, Leach and other activists from Alcatraz, like John Trudell (Santee Dakota) moved on to occupy the abandoned Nike Missile site at Richmond, California, but were removed in June 1971. In the 1980s, Leach returned to using her maiden name of Runnels. She worked to help her son Harry Leach, Jr., a recipient of the Bronze Star Medal and a Purple Heart, who had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, \\"triggered by his military service\\". Harry was accused of threatening to poison water supplies in San Jose, as well as Caesars Tahoe and Sahara Tahoe, both in Stateline, Nevada. His case brought the mental health of Vietnam veterans and the inadequate care they were receiving into the spotlight of the national media. After his acquittal, Runnels remarried and moved to Sonoma, California where the couple operated a chicken ranch. She returned to Washington, locating in Nespelem around 2000 and remained active in issues effecting the Colville Indian Reservation. Death and legacy Runnels died on January 29, 2010 in Grant, Mason County, Washington. She was buried near her family members in the Sacred Heart Cemetery in Nespelem. She was interviewed as part of the American Indian Historical Research Project in 1970 by Anna Boyd. Her interview is in the holdings of the Doris Duke Oral History Collection at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.

It went through various significant changes in extent. The eastern part very roughly corresponded to the present province of Mongala. Location A decree of 3 September 1886 by the Congo Free State administrator general Camille Janssen defined nine districts in the colony, each headed by a district commissioner. Bangala District was one of the districts named. The name comes from the Bangala language, the lingua-franca of the northeast Congo region. A decree of 1 August 1888 divided the Congo Free State into eleven districts, of which the first five were in the lower Congo region. Bangala District had been replaced by Ubangi-Uélé District. In 1895 the number of the districts was increased to fifteen, including Bangala District and Ubangi District. A map of the Congo Free State in 1897 shows the Bangalas district extending along both sides of the northwest section Congo River from Lake Tumba upstream to where the Itimbiri River enters from the north. It is bounded to the northwest by the Ubangi District, to the east by the Uellé District and Aruwimi District, and to the south by the Équateur District. Bangala District is shown on maps of 1910, 1912 and 1926 with somewhat different boundaries on each map. Équateur Province was created in 1917. As of 1926 the province included the districts of Ubangi, Bangala, Lulonga, Équateur and Lac Léopold II. With the reorganization of 1933, Ubangi District and Bangala District were combined to form Congo-Ubangi District, the northern part of Coquilhatville Province. Coquilhatville Province was renamed Équateur Province in 1947. Post-Independance On 14 August 1962 Cuvette Centrale Province and Ubangi Province were separated from Équateur Province, and on 5 February 1963 the remainder became Moyen-Congo Province. These three provinces were combined into a new Équateur Province on 25 April 1966. On 11 July 2015 Équateur was split into the present provinces of Équateur, Mongala, Nord- Ubangi, Sud-Ubangi and Tshuapa. Mongala very roughly corresponds to the eastern part of the former Bangala District.

H. Rogers and Mark Twain, 1908 Reisenweber's Cafe, also known as Reisenweber's Restaurant or simply Reisenweber's, was a restaurant, nightclub, and hotel in Columbus Circle, Manhattan, on the intersection of Eighth Ave and 58th Street, from 1856/7 to 1922. Reisenweber's Cafe was known for introducing and/or popularizing jazz \\"Reisenweber’s, where the Original Dixieland Jazz Band was discovered (spurring the jazz age) and where a hula dancer performed in Doraldina’s Hawaiian Room.

History  A banquet at Reisenweber's for a group of returning World War I soldiers, 1918 Reisenweber's started as a roadside tavern in 1856 or 1857, by John Reisenweber, a Brooklyn resident of German descent, at a time when the Columbus Circle area was still encircled by farmland. The 1890s bicycle craze significantly increased demand for the tavern, and Reisenweber's began a process of expansion under John Reisenweber Jr. and his son-in-law Louis Fischer, who was named restaurant manager in 1901. The restaurant was further substantially expanded in 1910 and 1916, eventually becoming a seven- floor complex of two buildings, with four stories used for dining and entertainment, including a first-floor restaurant, a second-floor cabaret (the \\"400 Club\\"), a third-floor dance floor (the \\"Paradise Supper Club\\"), a \\"Hawaiian Room\\" on the fourth floor, and a rooftop garden for patrons. The Paradise Club, built in 1916, was designed by Joseph Urban and cost $250,000 to construct (about $6 million in 2020 dollars). The hotel within the complex had 50 rooms as of 1905Kuhn, M. (1905). All happy. New York: Wynkoop, Hallenbeck, Crawford Co.. At its height, Reisenweber’s covered nearly an entire city block and “housed a dozen dining rooms, employed more than 1,000 in help and seated 5,000 diners at one time\\", making it one of the largest restaurants in the city. In 1917, Reisenweber's celebrated its 60th anniversary with an entertainment program broadcast by \\"wireless telephone\\", a novelty at the time. That year, the establishment was grossing $3,600 per day (about $85,000 per day in 2020 dollars).  Notable patrons  The Pleiades Club would occasionally meet at Reisenweber's. \\"After several seasons of moves, the Club settled in 1906 at the Hotel Brevoort, where it remained for most of its existence, with the exception of a few short-term stays at Reisenweber's and Hotel Martinique\\" The 1917 campaign to elect John F. Hylan mayor of New York City was first hatched at the Beefsteak Room of Reisenweber's first-floor restaurant, a popular gathering spot for the city's political scene. The wealthy wholesaler Sam Balcom was referred to as a \\"big butter-and-egg man\\" at Reisenweber's in reference to his lavish spending habits, which included inviting the entire chorus of popular musicals to the Reisenweber's cabaret, all expenses paid. This was likely the origin of the Prohibition-era slang phrase \\"big butter-and-egg man\\", that was later incorporated into the 1925 play The Butter and Egg Man and the jazz standard \\"Big Butter and Egg Man\\".

In 1912, Reisenweber's became the first restaurant in New York City to provide its patrons with space to dance, initially with tea dances at the Crystal Room and later with dancing at the lavish third-floor Paradise Supper Club. In 1913, Reisenweber's manager Louis Fischer introduced the first modern cover chargeJohn Reisenweber's 1931 obituary in the Brooklyn Standard Union. \\"Reisenweber's was the first to initiate dancing for its patrons and was instrumental in introducing the modern cabaret. They also installed the modern \\"cover charge\\" in 1913, when the fee for witnessing their elaborate entertainment specialties was twenty-five cents, an exorbitant sum at that time.\\" , to cover the production costs of Ned Wayburn's revues \\"To pay for Ned Wayburn's lavish revues in the Paradise Room, Reisenweber's imposed New York's first cover charge, a whopping twenty-five cents.\\". The Hawaiian Room on the fourth floor was opened for Doraldina's Hawaiian dance routine, precipitating the city's 1916 \\"Hawaiian craze\\". Sophie Tucker was a star performer at the second-floor 400 Club starting in 1918. Her \\"Bohemian Nights\\" performances helped popularize the modern cabaret style, and were so successful that the 400 Club was renamed the \\"Sophie Tucker Room\\" in 1919. = \\"Jass\\" at Reisenweber's = In January of 1917, the Original Dixieland Jass Band began an engagement playing for dancers at the second-floor 400 Club of Reisenweber's Cafe, an engagement that introduced jazz to a wider audience. In the words of jazz historian Joachim Berendt in his 1975 The Jazz BookBerendt. J. (1975). The jazz book: From New Orleans to rock and free jazz. New York, NY: Lawrence Hill and Company: Among the audience at the band's first week of performances were representatives from Victor Talking Machine Company, who signed a recording contract with the band. The Original Dixieland Jass Band recorded \\"Livery Stable Blues\\" and \\"Dixieland Jass Band One-Step\\", on February 26, 1917 at Victor's New York studiosJohn Robert Brown, A Concise History of Jazz. Mel Bay Publications, 2004, p. 25. , and the titles were released as Victor 18255 in May 1917, the first issued jazz record. The Original Dixieland Jass band would go on to record 25 singles between 1917 and 1923, including the 1917 \\"Reisenweber Rag\\" (Aeolian-Vocalion 1242). In 1918, Bert Kelly brought his \\"Jass Band\\", including Joe \\"Ragbaby\\" Stephens, Alcide Nunez, and Tom Brown, to New York City to fill in for the Original Dixieland Jass Band at Reisenweber's Cafe, while the latter was away on tour. After the Original Dixieland Jass Band returned to New York, the two continued to alternate at Reisenweber's. After the Kelly Band won greater approval from the crowds at a \\"Battle of the Bands\\" competition, Stephens, the drummer, found his drum heads slashed, after which he took the next train back to Chicago and never again headed east.  Decline and closure  The passage of the Volstead Act and start of national prohibition caused a decline in business, and manager Louis Fischer liquidated Reisenweber's Cafe in 1920 to pay off a $100,000 debt. In December 1921, Fischer sold his controlling interest in Reisenweber's to a syndicate run by John Wagener, Walter Kaffenberg, and B. H. Uberall, who announced that they would change the name of the business in the course of their reorganization. By 1922, Reisenweber's was operating in part as a speakeasy, serving private stocks of liquor at invitation-only events. On New Year's Day, 1922, prohibition agents raided a private party at the restaurant and served summonses to the manager, John Gorman, and his son for serving liquor to a half dozen diners. The prohibition agents alleged that \\"a telephone bell linked with all the dining rooms was to have been rung a certain number of times when [prohibition officers] appeared\\". In March of 1922, federal authorities sued to close Reisenweber's on the accusation that liquor was served on its premises, marking the first time that the injunction clause of the Volstead Act had been invoked in the Southern District of New York. On September 28, 1922, federal judge Martin T. Manton decreed the closing of Reisenweber's Cafe for a year, a decision that was upheld on appeal the following January. Reisenweber's never reopened. By November of 1923, the Paradise Gardens \\"dancing palace\\" was operating out of the former Reisenweber's Cafe. The Reisenweber's buildings housed a Woolworth store in the 1940s, and were finally demolished in the 1980s. Reisenweber's Brighton Beach Casino and Shelbourne Hotel Postcard of Reisenweber's Brighton Beach Casino, 1910 Starting in 1909, a second branch of Reisenweber's, Reisenweber's Brighton Beach Casino, operated in Brighton Beach, at Ocean Parkway and Surf Avenue, next door to the New Brighton Theater. The casino was built around 1907, in the lot that formerly belonged to Bader's Hotel. Its edifice was made of ornamental Spanish tile and brick, and its elaborate bar cost $42,000 to build (about $1,100,000 in 2020 dollars). Its top floor deck resembled the deck of an ocean liner, overlooking the beach and ocean, and an advertisement promised \\"All the Joys of a Sail, Without the Motion!\\". Dances were held in the Wisteria Ballroom. Reisenweber's Brighton Beach Casino featured performances by Lillian Russell and Eddie Cantor. The popular 1914 song \\"By the Beautiful Sea\\" was written on its terrace, during a party held by Russell and Diamond Jim Brady, who had a private dining room at the casino. John Reisenweber, Jr., later purchased the Ricca Donna Hotel on the other side of New Brighton Theater, renamed it the Shelbourne Hotel, and ran it as a sister entertainment venue to the Brighton Beach Casino. Both establishments were managed by Victor Herz, who would later become controller of the Trommer Brewery. Herz introduced the modern floor show to Brooklyn audiences, and the entertainers who performed at the Shelbourne included Sophie Tucker, George Jessel, Lila Lee, Ben Bernie, and Harry Richman. The Casino closed during prohibition and was replaced by a bathhouse, Publix Baths, and, in the early 1950s, a bingo parlor and event hall, Club 28. The building was demolished after an 1980 fire, likely caused by arson, and was replaced by a high-rise apartment building.

The species is known from fossils found in Middle Miocene deposits of central Oregon. T. rosayi are possibly the fruits belonging to the extinct trochodendraceous leaf species Trochodendron postnastae. Distribution and paleoenvironment Trochodendron rosayi fossils are found in the Moose Mountain Flora, formerly called the Cascadia flora or Menagerie Wilderness flora, of Linn County, Oregon. The flora is included in the Little Butte Volcanic series outcropping near the town of Cascadia in the central Oregon Cascades. Work on the flora by paleobotanist Jack Wolfe in 1964 gave an estimated age of Early Miocene, this was later revised by Wolfe and Tanai in 1987 to a Late Oligocene estimation. In the descriptive paper naming T. postnastae Manchester et al reported that radioisotope dating of plagioclase crystals collected by Robert Rosé from the fossilifrous horizon of the Moose Mountain flora had been performed. Using crystals obtained from tuffaceous sandstones, Argon–argon dating provided an age of 14.91 ± 0.23 Ma placing the flora as Middle Miocene Langhian stage. T. postnastae is found associated with species such as Acer cascadense, Acer smileyi, Concavistylon kvacekii, Ozakia emryi, and Trochodendron postnastae. The fruits are noted to be similar in size to the living Trochodendron aralioides while being bigger then the coeval Concavistylon fruits. Several additional Middle Miocene fossils were considered by Manchester et al to also be T. rosayi specimens. In 1991, Manchester et al made the first mention of several infructescences, including a figured specimen from the Latah Formation at Emerald Creek, Idaho. At that time the fossils were suggested to be indistinguishable from living T. aralioides fruits. Similarly a fossil first figured by Fields in 1996 from the Sucker Creek Formation in eastern Oregon is also considered to belong to T. rosayi. Taxonomy The species holotype was collected by Robert Rosé and is part of the Florida Museum of Natural Historys collections in Gainesville, Florida. The fossils were studied by paleobotanists Steven Manchester, Kathleen Pigg, and Melanie DeVore with their 2019 type description being published in the journal Fossil Imprint. The etymology of the specific name rosayi is a patronym honoring Robert Rosé. In addition to T rosayi Manchester et al provided descriptions of the coeval species Trochodendron postnastae and the related trochodendraceous species Concavistylon kvacekii. Based on the similarities of the T. rosayi fruits and T postnastae foliage, and on similar leaf and fruit associations in the older Klondike Mountain Formation of Washington state, Manchester et al considered it possible that the leaves and fruits were produced by he same plant. At the time of description however the two organs had not been found in connection, and so where described under separate names. The fruits are over double the size of the older Ypresian age Trochodendron drachukii fruits from the McAbee Fossil Beds in Canada. Description Trochodendron rosayi fruits are born on pedicels sprouting from a thick central stalk. The fruits have a globose to turbinate outline, with a narrow base that flares out towards the apex. The tops of the fruits are rounded with approximately ten locular slits joining at the fruit apex to from a polygonal opening when the mature fruits dehisced. The locular slits form just above the straight to slightly outwardly curved persistant styles which sprout from the fruit 1/3 of the way below the apex. Below the styles are triangular flattened structures that were likely the flower nectaries. Encircling the basal section of the fruits are an estimated 25 scars left by the shed stamens.

The film offers a look into the life and final days of Robin Williams, and how his struggles with diffuse Lewy body disease impacted his acting career and contributed to his death by suicide. The film was produced by Ben Sinclair, executive produced by physician and journalist, Shoshana R. Ungerleider and released digitally and on-demand on September 1, 2020.  Background  Robin Williams' widow, Susan Schneider Williams, chose the film's title, and approached director Tylor Norwood to make the film. Initially resistant, Norwood said he wanted to help people \\"understand the pain [Williams] felt as his talents and faculties rapidly slipped away\\" and he hopes the film \\"rights a wrong that was done to him, and takes away a cloud that has unjustly hung over his legacy for far too long.\\" Interviews include Susan Williams and Shawn Levy (who directed Williams in the Night at the Museum series), as well as John R. Montgomery and David E. Kelley, who both worked with Williams on the TV series The Crazy Ones.  Reception  On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85%, based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 7.49/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Robin's Wish offers an emotional look at the end of a life suddenly cut short—and pays warm tribute to the brilliant legacy that was left behind.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"a moving coda to a life ended much too soon\\" and wrote: \\"Robin's Wish suffers at times from its lack of objectivity. Williams' widow is clearly the project's driving force, with much of the story told from her perspective (his children, on the other hand, are not heard from at all). Nonetheless, the film, which incorporates testimony from several medical experts, fully succeeds in its admirable goal of using Williams' story to shed light on a disease with which many people were previously unfamiliar.\\"  References  External links  * Category:2020 documentary films Category:2020 films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Biographical films Category:Documentaries Category:English- language films Category:Films about mental states Category:Lewy body dementia Category:Robin Williams ","title":"Robin's Wish"},{"id":"65010619","title":"Rice Innovation District"},{"id":"65010641","title":"Athletics at the 1963 Pan American Games – Men's 4 × 400 metres relay"},{"id":"65010666","text":"Historic occupancy rates of congregate shelters may not provide appropriate physical distancing. Signs similar to this one from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare may remind evacuees to avoid risky behavior if posted at evacuation check-in areas or shared use facilities. Emergency evacuation may be required for people living in areas threatened by natural disasters. It is not advisable to set up congregate shelters in an environment heavily impacted by a pandemic. Non-congregate shelters typically provide more effective physical distancing. Examples include buildings with single room occupancy, hotels or dormitories with private sleeping spaces but possibly shared bathroom or cooking facilities. Historic procedures maximizing capacity of public transport and emergency shelters may be inconsistent with quarantine and physical distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Evacuation planning  Evacuation plans may be prepared for areas routinely experiencing life-threatening conditions. Texas coastal regions have standing agreements in place with inland communities that take in evacuees and people rescued from hurricanes. Port Arthur and Beaumont evacuate to San Antonio, while Galveston evacuates to Austin. The state provides buses to transport people to the partner cities and towns where they are checked in and taken to government-paid hotel or motel rooms where families can be better isolated than in congregate shelters. The city's costs for the hotels, like emergency shelters, were expected to be reimbursable with disaster funds from the federal government. Texas increased its contracted number of buses, because a bus that might previously have transported fifty people may seat only fifteen or twenty with physical distancing. Masks were required on buses and were provided to those who don't have them. As hotels filled to capacity in the normal evacuation cities, evacuees were urged to stay on the road north toward Dallas. Evacuees were checked for fevers before getting on the bus transporting them.  Individual preparation  Residents in the projected path of hurricanes were encouraged stockpile food and water for two weeks, and to prepare an emergency evacuation kit including everything needed to survive unassisted for three days with prescription medications for a full month. Evacuees coming to shelters were encouraged to bring extra clothing, pillows, blankets, other comfort items and important documents. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended adding the following items to an emergency evacuation supply kit: * Disinfectant wipes and spray * Bar or liquid soap * Hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol * Minimum of two masks per person for each person over the age of 2 in your household  Evacuation registration points  Some large indoor shelters were replaced with evacuation check-in points where evacuees were given hotel room vouchers, while others were assigned dormitory rooms at colleges where classes had been cancelled. Evacuees arriving by car lined up in the parking lot and remained in their vehicle during the screening. Those arriving by foot or bicycle, or dropped off by a taxi or ride-share service were to maintain physical distancing and stay 6 feet away from other people. Arriving evacuees were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and exposure by Public Health or other qualified personnel. COVID-19 positive individuals and members of their household were routed or transported to the most appropriate shelter site. Individuals identified as COVID-19 positive or symptomatic, and/or exposed to COVID-19, were not sheltered with the general population.  Medical needs shelters  Locations receiving evacuees may establish a medical shelter for evacuees with COVID-19 symptoms or other health needs. Mississippi opened shelters including the Mississippi State Medical Needs Shelter in Wiggins. Admission to the Mississippi State Medical Needs Shelter is evaluated based on the following criteria: * Those with health or medical conditions who require professional observation or care, * Those with chronic conditions who require assistance with daily living activities or skilled nursing care, but do not require hospitalization, * Those who need supervised medication dispensing or vital signs readings, * Those with physical, mental, or cognitive disabilities who cannot be sheltered in a general population shelter, or * Those with other disabilities who cannot be sheltered in a general population shelter.  Congregate shelters  The American Red Cross published Pre-Landfall Shelter Operations in COVID-19 Pandemic guidelines. Red Cross physical distancing guidelines for congregate shelters may reduce historic shelter capacity by 60 percent. Emergency shelter personnel followed CDC official guidance, local health officer orders, and best practices to protect shelter guests and workers and reduce the rate of transmission of COVID-19. Modifications to shelter operations include: * Temperature checks, ongoing screening, and assessment of shelter guests and workers for COVID-19 symptoms. Shelter workers used personal protective equipment (PPE) when conducting temperature checks and screening. * Shelter guests were instructed to watch their children for signs of illness and immediately inform shelter staff if they start to feel ill while sheltering or if they observe children who may be ill. * Shelter guests and workers were instructed to avoid touching high-touch surfaces, such as handrails, as much as possible; and to wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol immediately after touching these surfaces. Shelters provided additional hand-washing stations in addition to normal restroom facilities. * Individual meals were distributed without buffet set-up or queue area. * Cots were spaced further apart to allow for physical distancing. FEMA recommends per person for long-term sheltering. * Face coverings were required. * Pets were excluded from Red Cross shelters. United States gulf coast evacuees were urged to go to a friend or relative's home or a hotel, and consider the shelter a last resort because of COVID-19 risks; although shelters might open for families, who could be housed together in tents inside shelter facilities if absolutely necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic coincided with record-breaking wildfires in the western United States and a record number of hurricane landfalls in the southeastern United States. Thousands of evacuees from Hurricane Laura were still in emergency lodgings as Hurricane Delta approached the Louisiana coast. Six-thousand from southwest Louisiana were in twelve New Orleans area hotels.

It went through various significant changes in extent. It roughly corresponds to the present province of Kongo Central. Location A map of the Congo Free State in 1897 shows four small districts along the lower reaches of the Congo River. From the sea they were Banana District, Boma District, Matadi District and Cataractes District. Above them Stanley Pool District extended north along the east shore of the Congo River. The Free State was annexed by Belgium in 1908 as the Belgian Congo. In 1910 the districts of Banana, Boma, Matadi and Cataracts were consolidated into the Bas-Congo District. Bas-Congo contained the port of Boma, the main port of entry to the Belgian Congo. The district was bounded to the south by Portuguese possessions, now Angola, and to the north by a Portuguese enclave of Cabinda and then by the French Congo, now the Republic of the Congo. Bas- Congo District is shown on maps of 1910, 1912 and 1926 with somewhat different boundaries on each map. In the 1910 and 1912 maps it is bounded by the Moyen- Congo District to the northeast and the Kwango District to the east. Congo- Kasaï formally became a vice-government in 1919. It contained the districts of Bas-Congo, Léopoldville, Kwango, Kasai and Sankuru. A 1926 map shows that Bas- Congo had been extended to the north, absorbing the lower part of Moyen-Congo District, and now bordered Lac Léopold II District to the north. With the 1933 reorganization Bas-Congo had been extended again to include a section of Lac Léopold II District along the Congo. Bas-Congo, Léopoldville, Kwango and Lac Léopold II were now included in the Léopoldville Province. A 1955-1957 map shows that Bas-Congo had been reduced to a small region at the mouth of the Congo, with Cataractes District now extending east and northeast, surrounding the urban district of Léopoldville. The area was now just out of a total of for Léopoldville province as a whole. Post-Independance On 14 August 1962 the province of Congo Central was formed from part of Léopoldville Province. It was renamed Bas-Zaïre from 27 October 1971, Bas-Congo in 1997 and received its current name of Kongo Central in 2015.

Livshits the name is derived from Old Iranian *Sāsāna (\\"defeating enemy\\"). It was the name of a local Zoroastrian deity venerated in Indo-Parthia and Khwarazm.  Biography  Farn-Sasan gained control of the Indo-Parthian throne sometime in 210. The identity of his predecessor is unknown; it may have been Pacores. Farn-Sasan is not mentioned in any literary sources, and is only solely known through his coins, which has the inscription; \\"Farn-Sasan, son of Adur-Sasan, grandson of Tirdat, son of the grandson of Sanabares, the King of Kings.\\" With this inscription, Farn-Sasan tried to legitimize his rule by linking himself with his great- grandfather Sanabares, who was the last prominent Indo-Parthian king. Although the title of King of Kings is put after the name of Sanabares, Farn-Sasan in reality refers himself as King of Kings, a title which was regularly used by the Achaemenid and Parthian rulers. Neither Adur-Sasan nor Tirdat is known to have ruled, which implies that Farn-Sasan was seemingly from a cadet branch of the dynasty. On the obverse of his coins, he is portrayed with a cap. On the reverse, a fire altar is depicted, with an inscription circled around it. The usage of fire altar on coinage was uncommon in Sakastan, and were only minted by Farn-Sasan. Around the same time, another king issued coins with a similar fire-atar depicted on it, which was the Sasanian ruler Ardashir I (), who around the same time was extending his domains into the east. It is uncertain if Farn-Sasan copied the iconography of Ardashir I's reverse coins, or vice versa. The resemblance of the coinage of Farn-Sasan and the Sasanian Ardashir I, including the shared name Sasan—a name popular in the Indo-Parthian realm—suggests that the Sasanians and Indo-Parthians possibly shared a common ancestry. In circa 226, Farn-Sasan was defeated by the Ardashir I, who conquered Sakastan, thus dissolving the Indo-Parthians.

It is a broad history of the Early Middle Ages, the period after what is commonly called the fall of the Western Roman Empire (though multiple reviewers argue Wickham is critical of the view that Rome fell). The book received mostly positive reviews.  Reception  A reviewer at the University of Oxford said Wickham's analysis is potent for challenging \\"two of the predominant misconceptions held about the Middle Ages; firstly, that the 10 centuries or so that spanned between the fall of Rome and Renaissance were wholly unsophisticated and brutal [...] and secondly that this period acted as the birthing of what we may call a 'modern nation'\\". The reviewer also called the book \\"remarkably easy to pick up and read [...] a gentle but engaging introduction into [the] period\\". John R. Vallely of the Historical Novel Society said that while the book is for somewhat knowledgeable readers rather than novices, such readers \\"will be impressed at his analysis of a world staggered by political turbulence but resilient in its response.\\" Tyler Cowen lauded it as one of the best history books he had ever read, praising its “[fluid] integration of historical and archeological sources” and its “illuminating discussion of how family control made it incentive-compatible to invest so much wealth in monasteries”, among other things. In The Telegraph, Dominic Sandbrook dubbed The Inheritance of Rome a \\"worthy competitor\\" to Gibbon's history, commending \\"Wickham's awe-inspiring command of his sources\\" and \\"vast geographical and comparative range, so that we get a sense not just of one society, but of half a dozen or more\\". He called the author \\"a pithy and compelling guide through the narrative complexities of Constantinople politics\\" and praised Wickham for showing how both the Byzantium and the Abbasid Caliphate \\"were the heirs of Rome\\". Sandbrook described the book as \\"a superlative work of historical scholarship\\" that illuminates murky corners of the time period. The Independent's Boyd Tonkin wrote that \\"this epic of European history between 400 and 1000AD leaves no cliché unchallenged.\\" He said that \\"gripping as Wickham's narratives prove from Scotland to Byzantium, his impatience with myth for a time leaves us with history as one damn thing after another. Only at the end does this majestic panorama specify the [...] trends behind the tales.\\" A reviewer for Publishers Weekly billed the book as \\"a magisterial narrative of the political, economic, cultural and religious fabrics [...] Wickham's achievement contributes richly to our picture of this often narrowly understood period.\\" A reviewer for The New Yorker asserted that while \\"a single volume [...] using only a slender and unreliable documentary record and no narrative crutches, [covering] six centuries and at least seven major rival powers\\" sounds like an historiographical stunt, Wickham \\"largely pulls it off\\". He credits Wickham with striking comparisons such as valuations in Ireland (slave women and cows) versus valuations in other early medieval societies (coins). Matthew Hoskin, an historian at the University of Edinburgh, wrote a highly positive review in 2014 and described The Inheritance of Rome as a \\"tour-de-force of narrative history\\", saying the author makes a large story of interlocking stories readable by \\"carefully [choosing] not to tell everything at once.\\" He also said that Wickham remembering \\"the importance of Eastern Europe and the Middle East for the development of history in this period makes it stand out in relation to other books about the era. Indeed, the breadth of The Inheritance of Rome is astounding.\\" Some reviewers were less enthusiastic. The Guardian's Ian Mortimer praised the book for providing information that challenges common generalizations about the period and said, \\"The breadth of reading is astounding, the knowledge displayed is awe-inspiring, and the attention quietly given to critical theory and the postmodern questioning of evidence is both careful and sincere.\\" However, Mortimer also argued that Wickham overly stresses the difficulty of knowing the specifics of the period and is too wary about offering interpretations that might face criticism. He also said the author gives too little attention to such aspects of the period as battles, private life, and the aesthetics of artifacts, stating that ultimately \\"all one can see is blurred masses, not people.\\" Laura Schneiderman said in Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Wickham “sheds little light on the murk” and generally presents events without examining motivations behind them. She said that the work “reads like a lengthy academic paper that assumes the reader already knows a great deal about the period”, and that the author “organizes his chapters around the points he wants to make rather than around coherent narratives.” Michael Patrick Brady of PopMatters described it as \\"a very meticulous, overwhelmingly detailed account [...] It is, at times, exhausting and cluttered, but also laden with interesting passages that shed light on this volatile period\\". He said that \\"the most tedious\\" chapters are those on cultures organized immediately after the Roman Empire's fragmentation, due to the chapters' reliance on archaeological evidence. He criticized the section on the Merovingian era as \\"replete with names and dates, but utterly lacking in significant context, motivation, or revelation\\", considering this evidence the Early Middle Ages are indeed a period obscured by a dearth of reliable information despite Wickham's view. Brady called the portions on the more stable polities \\"a fuller, more colorful depiction of their inner workings [...] much more enlightening\\", ultimately crediting the author with as thorough a depiction of the time period as is possible.

The proposed tunnel would have connected the Western Addition and Fillmore Districts, near the south portal at Sutter Street, with Marina and Cow Hollow, near the north portal at Filbert Street. One tunnel would have been reserved for railroad and pedestrian traffic, while the parallel tunnel would have been for vehicles. The tunnel was planned, along with the contemporary Twin Peaks and Stockton Street Tunnels, to serve the traffic that was anticipated from the 1914–15 Panama–Pacific International Exposition. The tunnel was first announced in early 1912. However, the preparation of detailed plans and permits delayed the estimated start of construction to July 1914, which meant the tunnel could not be completed in time to service the Exposition, and the project was killed in September 1913. History Harbor View with the Western Addition Shortly after the directors of the Panama–Pacific International Exposition (PPIE) selected a site in the Harbor View district, the merchants along Fillmore formed the Fillmore Street Improvement Association (FSIA) to study the possibility of constructing a tunnel along Fillmore Street. The FSIA hired an engineer to prepare preliminary plans and estimates, and FSIA members visited similar contemporary tunnels in Los Angeles to obtain practical advice; an official announcement was scheduled for early January 1912. Fillmore Street had come into prominence following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which forced many businesses to relocate from Market to Fillmore. In addition to the temporary benefit to speed traffic to and from the PPIE, the Fillmore Tunnel was expected to spur development along the northern waterfront for trade via the Panama Canal and to shorten the commute from the Marin County suburbs. The Fillmore Street Tunnel and a rival parallel route under Steiner Street, one block to the west, were compared in January 1912. While Steiner Street proponents declared their tunnel would be shorter and less expensive, the FSIA argued that tradition and existing streetcar routes favored their proposal. They pressed the case for Fillmore in a front-page editorial published in January 1912, and the editors of the San Francisco Call agreed with FSIA. By February, the Fillmore alignment was being favored over competing parallel routes along Steiner, Pierce, and Divisadero; however, the land and tunnels committee of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors delayed their official endorsement of the Fillmore Street Tunnel proposal while awaiting the results of consultant Bion J. Arnold's study; Arnold declared his support in March 1912 via telegram. Later that month, the City Attorney determined that rail service could be provided through the tunnel as an alternative to the existing surface streetcar franchise granted to the United Railroads of San Francisco (URR) on Fillmore; URR service was via the 23-line (Fillmore-Valencia) up the south side of Fillmore to Broadway, connecting to the Fillmore Counterbalance funicular on the steep north side down to Green on the Bay waterfront. Arnold followed up with a written report in April 1912 with a more detailed design and a cost estimate of $1.7–1.8 million, depending on configuration. Funding for the tunnel became an issue. Special assessment districts were established to cover the areas at the north and south ends of the tunnel, keeping with precedent established for the contemporary Twin Peaks and Stockton Street Tunnels. Property owners within these districts would be responsible to pay an extra tax based on property size; in return, the tunnel was expected to increase the assessed value of the property in the assessment districts after completion. The fairgrounds for PPIE were in the northern special assessment district, but the land had been leased, and the PPIE Company could not agree on a plan to share the cost of the special property tax with the owners. In April 1912, the PPIE Company declined a tunnel assessment cost-sharing proposal, stating their budget was reserved for construction of buildings and grounds for the Exposition. The northern assessment district for the Fillmore Tunnel was projected to overlap with a western assessment district for a planned Broadway Tunnel, which would have caused some property owners to pay for two tunnels. The competing Devisadero Street Improvement Association also filed a protest over their inclusion in the special assessment district, stating they would receive no benefit and promoting their alignment instead. Residents of Harbor View also opposed further industrial development of their neighborhood. View north along Fillmore towards San Francisco Bay and Marin County, taken north of the intersection with Broadway (2009); the steep grade is apparent. By September 1912, the preliminary engineering design was complete and legal work began to acquire the properties needed to widen Fillmore at the north and south portals. In December, the San Francisco Call reported that plans for the Fillmore Street Tunnel were almost completed, and estimated that construction would begin the following Spring; according to City Engineer M.M. O'Shaughnessy, the tunnel would take approximately 11 months to complete and would have been ready by Spring 1914. The Fillmore Street Tunnel Property Owners' association was formed that month to advocate for the tunnel's construction. On February 24, 1913, the Board of Supervisors unanimously adopted a resolution to build a streetcar line on Van Ness Avenue (completed in 1914 as the D Geary-Van Ness) and construct the Fillmore Street Tunnel. Arnold's report to the City of San Francisco, submitted on March 1913, urged \\"the Fillmore Street tunnel should be built immediately, extending from Sutter Street to Filbert Street, with the necessary street-widening at portals to preserve the roadways at either side for street-cars, traffic, and sidewalks.\\" The proposed Fillmore tunnel offered the best combination of grade and level despite its relatively long length. In May 1913, the lands and tunnels committee were beset by property owners in the special assessment districts demanding to know what their levies would be, bringing further progress to a halt. The number of protests led at least one supervisor to propose the cost should be spread city-wide instead of two special assessment districts. O'Shaughnessy quashed rumors the Fillmore Street Tunnel would cost $6–10 million, stating that his estimate was less than $3 million based on detailed designs his office was preparing in June 1913. Plan of the Panama–Pacific International Exposition grounds at Harbor View; Fillmore connects just to the right of the phrase \\"main exhibit palaces\\". Although the tunnel had not started construction by June 1913, the Call confidently predicted that work would begin that fall; upon completion, 80% of San Francisco's residents would have direct access to the central gate for the Panama–Pacific Exposition via the proposed tunnel. Plans were also announced that Robert Dollar Steamship Company would add large concrete docks to Harbor View once the fair had concluded, giving more support for the Fillmore Street Tunnel, leading to notable real estate speculation along Fillmore. Cutaway profile of Fillmore Street Tunnel project (1913) However, the final design for the tunnel continued to be delayed until August, leaving little time for construction to complete prior to the exposition. In addition, costs were expected to be relatively high: while the Twin Peaks tunnel had been contracted for $4 million, the shorter Fillmore tunnel was expected to cost $2.9 million because of its greater complexity and width. Tunnel advocates appealed directly to Mayor Rolph and asserted the $2.9 million estimate was overly conservative, meaning the special assessment, estimated at $1 per square foot of property, should be closer to $0.08/ft2 instead. In a late push to build support, The Call ran stories throughout 1913 featuring supportive citizens, businessmen, and property owners in the assessment districts. Despite these efforts, by September the directors of the PPIE firmly opposed the tunnel, saying that construction activities would disrupt the exposition and that it would not be ready by 1915. One of the original advocates for the tunnel, Samuel Adelstein, now also opposed the tunnel's construction, as he felt the improvement district levies for his property was disproportionately large. Believing that it could not be finished in time for the exposition, the Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution to abandon the Fillmore Tunnel project in mid-September; by that time, the estimated start of construction had slipped to July 1914. Design The tunnel was to run from Sutter to Filbert, including approaches. Its design was divided into two bores: one was wide for pedestrian and rail traffic, and the other bore was wide with three vehicle lanes. The maximum vertical clearance within the tunnel as designed was at the center of each bore. When completed, the maximum grade along Fillmore would have been reduced to 2.3 percent; an alternative, constructing a balanced cable way on the surface, would require a maximum 25.4 percent grade. Arnold's study, which included considering alternative routes for both low-level tunnels along Steiner (from Pine to Union) and Divisadero (from Pine to Lombard), and high-level tunnels along Divsiadero (Sacramento to Greenwich) and Broadway (Mason to Larkin), concluded the Fillmore tunnel offered the best (low-level) approach and grade, but would cost significantly more than the similar Stockton Street Tunnel due to its additional length and bore size. The design would have widened Fillmore along the two blocks at either end (between Bush and Sutter on the south, and between Union and Filbert on the north) to accommodate the approaches; the existing URR Fillmore line would continue to run over the hill. In the initial plan, the tunnel was to be bored from the north using a tunneling shield, with the material removed to be used as fill to reclaim land at Harbor View. Several test wells were drilled along the proposed route to determine the composition of the hill. Although most of the test bores encountered only sand and clay, near the crest of the hill at Broadway, the drill encountered broken rock below the surface and would not go further.

The boats were armed with eight internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of 20 torpedoes. They were also armed with a single /40 deck gun and two single or twin mounts for Type 96 anti- aircraft guns. They were equipped to carry one Type A midget submarine aft of the conning tower.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 104 Construction and commissioning Ordered under the Rapid Naval Armaments Supplement Programme and built by the Sasebo Naval Arsenal at Sasebo, Japan, I-46 was laid down on 21 November 1942 with the name Submarine No. 376 and was numbered I-46 on 25 May 1943. Launched on 3 June 1943 and provisionally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District, she was completed and commissioned on 29 February 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-46 formally was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for shakdeown and work-ups. During a training sortie in the Iyo-nada on 2 April 1944, she collided underwater with the submarine off Minase Bight southwest of Kominasa Light at 21:45, suffering damage to her conning tower and periscopes. After repairs and testing, she arrived at Sasebo Navy Yard on 7 May 1944 for additional repairs. I-46 was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in the 6th Fleet on 30 May 1944. On 12 August 1944, her commanding officer submitted a memorandum to the headquarters of the 6th Fleet and the commander of Submarine Squadron 11 suggesting improvements to the Type 13 air search radar installation and application of the anti-radar coating aboard I-46. On 13 October 1944, the Combined Fleet ordered the activation of Operation Shō-Gō 1, the defense of the Philippine Islands, in anticipation of an American invasion of the islands. I-46 departed Kure, Japan, to begin her first war patrol and take part in Shō-Gō 1, assigned a patrol area east of Leyte in the Philippines as part of the \\"B\\" Group. Her patrol area was the westernmost of those assigned to the submarines of her group, and was adjacent to the area assigned to the submarine . On 20 October 1944, the Battle of Leyte began with U.S. landings on Leyte. In response, major units of the Imperial Japanese Navy converged on Leyte, resulting in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which lasted from 23 to 26 October 1944. On 24 October, the 6th Fleet ordered eleven submarines, including I-46, to converge in an area extending from Samar to Surigao Strait. While I-46 was operating east of Leyte on 25 October 1944, a U.S. patrol plane forced her to dive at 06:45. A ship she identified from its propeller noises as a destroyer pursued her for the next eleven hours, during which she heard over 200 distant depth charge explosions. On 26 October 1944, I-46 transmitted a report that she had sighted a small Allied convoy east of her patrol area. She was never heard from again. When the 6th Fleet ordered her to move to a new patrol station east of Leyte on 27 October 1944, she did not acknowledge it.  Loss  The circumstances of I-46′s loss remain unknown. At 12:18 on 28 October 1944, the destroyers and detected a submarine attempting to penetrate the screen of United States Navy Task Group 38.4 — which included the aircraft carriers , , , and — east of Leyte. While the aircraft carriers steered away from the submarine contact at high speed, Gridley made three depth charge attacks against the submarine and Helm made four. After Helm′s fourth attack, which took place at 14:11, a large explosion followed by two smaller ones occurred. Oil and air bubbles appeared on the surface, and damaged deck planking and human remains were recovered after the attack. The submarine sank at . On both 30 October and 1 November 1944, , I-46, and I-54 all failed to make scheduled daily 19:00 status reports. On 2 December 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-46 to be presumed lost east of the Philippines with the loss of all 112 men on board. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 March 1945. The identity of the submarine Gridley and Helm sank remains a mystery, and has been reported both as I-46 and I-54.

History  The school was built in 1910 to serve the Atlanta neighborhood of Western Heights, a predecessor of today's English Avenue neighborhood. Additional construction occurred between 1911 and 1930 as the school's enrollment continued to grow. As part of the system of school segregation in the United States, the school was initially only open for White Americans, but in 1950, due to changes in the neighborhoods demographics, it was changed to an African American school. On December 12, 1960, the school was the site of a bombing after the school's auditorium had been used for a prayer meeting prior to an anti-segregation protest the previous day. The event has been called \\"one of the worst racially motivated bombings in the city of Atlanta.\\" The school closed in 1995. Since the school's closing, the building has remained unoccupied.

The Chase method is based on the discredited idea that retained waste in the body causes tumours. Chase stated that raw fruit and vegetables soak up unexcreted wastes like a sponge so should be consumed daily. The Chase method consists of fasting, consuming vegetable juice, bed rest and enemas. Chase was influenced by John Henry Tilden and aimed to eliminate human diseases through dietary methods. Chase encouraged the consumption of vegetable juice from celery, parsley and cabbage leaves as she believed they soak out unexcreted wastes. Sulfur containing foods such as eggs, fish and meat are forbidden. Colon cleansing must be practiced daily. Coffee and fruit juices such as grapefruit and lemon are to be taken as enemas. Chase wrote that \\"the coffee enema by rectum is a stimulant, by mouth it is a poisonous beverage\\".

Early life and education Harry Volk grew up in Trenton, New Jersey, and attended Rutgers College, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in 1927 and a law degree in 1930. Prudential Insurance He joined Prudential Insurance Company in 1930 as a vice president and, as senior vice president, created the company’s first regional home office in Los Angeles, California, in 1947. He helped mastermind Prudential’s decentralization and originated the family policy, a life insurance innovation. Union Bank Because of his work with Prudential, which included instigating the return of unclaimed funds to beneficiaries, Volk was recruited as chairman and chief executive officer of Union Bank of California in 1957. Volk was considered a banking pioneer. He helped bring about new offerings like daily compounding of interest and banking by mail, which were radical for the time. It was Volk, a trained lawyer, who spotted the loophole in federal laws that made it possible for banks to form holding companies, and in 1967 he established the country's first one-bank holding company, Union Bancorp Inc. He also had a knack for spotting executive talent, hiring such individuals as Carl E. Reichardt, later the highly-successful CEO of Wells Fargo Bank, and Donald Prell, a visionary venture capitalist who was responsible for producing Union Bank’s first and only 30-year Strategic Plan. In the turbulent economic times of the 1970s, Volk and Union Bank had their setbacks. He took Union into insurance and mortgage banking, only to have California regulators insist that it pull out of those enterprises in 1975. The bank never quite regained its vibrant growth. Many of its higher-level executives departed, and a significant number of the bank's business customers followed them to their new employers. During the bleak days of the mid-1970s as banks began to fail, Volk managed reductions in staff through attrition, telling a reporter: “There were no wholesale firings. We simply adjusted our staff to the workload.” Union Bank was taken over by Standard Chartered Bank of London in 1979. Volk retired a year later. Philanthropy While still at Prudential, Volk was asked to head a Los Angeles citizens committee to resolve disputes involving the United Way fund-raising campaign and its recipient charities. Volk set up what he called Associated In-Group Donors, an innovative system for voluntary contributions by employees through payroll withholding. It has now become the standard for nonprofit fund-raising organizations. With that, he persuaded United Way to accept policies for collecting and distributing donations, including a “donor choice” option directing how a contribution could be allotted. Volk was a prime mover in rebuilding Los Angeles's historic Bunker Hill district. He helped found many cultural institutions, including the Music Center and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. After he retired from Union Bank in 1980, he became head of the Weingart Foundation, a California charitable organization with $155 million in assets established by a longtime banking customer of Volk, Ben Weingart. By the time Volk retired from the foundation in 1993, its assets had increased to more than $500 million. Personal life Volk’s wife of 41 years, Marion, died in 1972. He was survived by his second wife, actress Marjorie Lord, who died in 2015. Lord was best known for playing the role of Kathy, the second wife of Danny Thomas, on the long-running television series, The Danny Thomas Show. Volk's stepdaughter is the actress Anne Archer.

She played an influential public role in the Byzantine Iconoclasm, as well as the controversial second marriage of emperor Constantine VI. Her biography was written by her son, Theodore the Studite. Life Theoctista was the daughter of a Byzantine official and married her father's colleague, another wealthy official in Constantinople, Photius. She was described as very religious, strong-willed and strict, generous to the poor and ambitious for her sons. She supported the iconophile policy of Irene of Athens, and her house became a meeting place of the pro-icon party in Constantinople. She sold most of the property of the family and moved to Bithynia, where she founded a monastery on her estate Sakkoudion, were her husband and her brother and sons became monks, while she and her daughter were the only women allowed. She was related to Empress Theodote but protested on religious grounds to Emperor Constantine VI's divorce and remarriage to Theodote in 795, and her monastery became a center of the opposition toward it. The emperor, therefore, had her monastery dissolved and arrested her brother Plato and her son, Theodore. Theoktiste became the leader of the opposition in Constantinople, which resulted in her arrest. Her arrest gave her martyr status and was one of the factors which eased the way for the succession of Irene to the throne in 797. After Irene's accession, Theoktiste and her family were able to open their monastery again, where Theoktiste lived another five years under extreme asceticism.

It is set on the boundary of Norse Peak Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. It is situated north of Crystal Mountain ski area, and one mile west of the crest of the Cascade Range. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the east slope of Castle's Southeast Peak. Precipitation runoff from Castle Mountain drains into tributaries of the White River. Climate Castle Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association was a Supreme Court case related to Indian fishing rights in Washington State. It held that the usual and accustomed clause of the Stevens Treaties protected Indians share of anadromous fish in addition to protecting fishing grounds. To do this, runs of anadromous fish that travel through tribal fishing areas should be divided equally between treaty-protected and non-treaty parties. After that, the treaty-protected parties cut should be lowered if they can be satisfied with a smaller amount. The court also held that its decision superseded state law, and that Washington's Game and Fisheries Department may be required to make laws upholding the ruling. “Full Case Name: Washington v.

Fish Wars and Boldt Decision  Billy Frank Jr., an important activist in the Fish Wars Over the next 50 years the salmon populations were depleted. In the 1960's and 70's, Indians were targeted and arrested for fishing. In response, many Indians started protesting by fishing on rivers. Tensions flared until it was brought before the district court. As a result of this, the US brought suit against Washington in support of the Indian's right to fish. The usual and accustomed grounds clause was used to support the right. Four interpretations arose from the following legal battles. The Game Department argued this only allowed access to fishing grounds and exemptions from license fees. The Fisheries Department argued this allowed a \\"fair and equitable share\\", which they decided to be one-third of the salmon in a run. The United States argued that it gave them 50% of the salmon in a run or to their needs, whichever was lower. The Indian tribes argued that they were entitled to an unlimited share of fish. In the district court, Judge Boldt decided in favor of the Indians. He interpreted the usual and accustomed grounds clause as meaning that the state needed provide Indians with both grounds to fish and a supply of fish to harvest. Washington was required to provide a \\"moderate living\\" to the tr ibes, which Boldt decided to be 50% of the fish (taking the United States treaty interpretation).American Indian Law Journal. US v State of Washington. Vol. 7, 19 May 2017, p. 54. American Indian Law Journal.  Challenge in State Courts  In the following years, the Boldt decision was challenged twice in the State Supreme Court. In Puget Sound Gillnetters Assn. v. Moos and Fishing Vessel Assn. v. Tollefson it was decided the federal injunction could not be followed. This made the state switch to the Game Department's interpretation. Due to conflict between state and federal treaty interpretations, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the decisions.

It is an erect shrub with its stems and leaves densely covered with silvery, greyish-green hairs, and has narrow egg-shaped leaves and white to cream-coloured flowers with mauve or purple striations inside. Description Prostanthera althoferi is an erect shrub that typically grows to a height of with stems that are square in cross- section and densely covered with silvery, greyish-green hairs. The leaves are sessile, linear to narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, densely covered with silvery, greyish-green hairs, long and wide. The flowers are arranged singly in four to twenty leaf axils near the ends of branchlets, each flower on a densely hairy pedicel long. The sepals form a green to cream- coloured, hairy tube tinged with maroon and long with two lobes, the lower lobe broadly egg-shaped, long and wide, the upper lobe long and wide. The petals form a white to cream-coloured tube long with mauve to purple striations inside. The lower lip has three lobes, the centre lobe spatula- shaped, long and wide and the side lobes long and wide. The upper lip has two lobes long and about wide. Flowering occurs from March to October. Taxonomy Prostanthera althoferi was first formally described in 1988 by Barry Conn in the journal Nuytsia from specimens collected near Leonora in 1975. The specific epithet (althoferi) honours George Althofer. In the same journal, Conn described two subspecies and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Prostanthera althoferi B.J.Conn subsp. althoferi has leaves long; * Prostanthera althoferi subsp. longifolia B.J.Conn has leaves long. Distribution and habitat This mintbush grows on sandplains, granite outcrops, low sandy rises and dunes. Subspecies althoferi is restricted to Western Australia where it is found in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Great Victoria Desert, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Subspecies longifolia occurs in the southern part of the Northern Territory and the northern arid and western pastoral regions and Eyre Peninsula in South Australia.

Stuart Clark & William Monter: Witchcraft and Magic in Europe, Volume 4: The Period of the Witch Trials While there is much secondary information about witch trials in France, the poor state of documentation often makes them hard to confirm. As no national Witchcraft Act was enacted in France, they fell under the jurisdiction of local courts and the witch hunt differed between regions. The witch trials of Northern France fell under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Paris, which was normally not liberal in enforcing the death penalty. However, the local courts did not always defer to Paris, which is another contributing factor to the difficulty in estimating the witch hunt in France. Present day North Eastern France is known to have experienced a severe witch hunt, close to the border of the territories of the Catholic Prince Bishops as it was, but at that point this, part of France belonged to the Holey Roman Empire. History During the first half of the 16th-century, a few cases of witch trials are noted to have taken place in France. In 1539 a witch trial resulted in four executions in Beaujolais; in 1553 a \\"Faustian magician\\" was executed in Poitiers; and in 1558 and 1562 witch trials were conducted in Nevers and Toulouse respectively both of whom resulted in three executions. In France, no national witchcraft law was introduced, and the procedure of such a trial was therefore up to the local court and judge to decide. The book Demonomanie by Jean Bodin, which was published in 1578, was to have a great impact upon the witch trials in France. Northern France Northern France was under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Paris, and all sentences of local witchcraft trials therefore fell under its jurisdiction. This proved to have an inhibiting effect on witch trials in Northern France. Between 1568 and 1625, the Parliament of Paris only confirmed one hundred death sentences for witchcraft and thus confirmed less than five percent of the cases from local courts which were put before it. The Parliament of Paris refused to follow the example of other countries and make witchcraft an \\"Exceptional Crime\\". In 1588, the Parliament issued regulations to prevent what they termed as \\"excessive\\" zeal and exaggerations in witchcraft persecutions. However, it is known that local courts ignored the recommendations of the Parliament of Paris, and those local witchcraft sentences which were never reported or appealed to Paris, is unknown or unconfirmed. In 1624, a new law required all sentences made by a local court in Northern France to be confirmed by the Parliament of Paris before they could be carried out. With one exception, the Parliament of Paris stopped confirming death sentenced for witchcraft after 1625. However, local witch trials who did not report their cases to be confirmed by Paris would still go undetected. Southern France Southern France was not under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Paris, and a number of large witch trials were conducted there during the first half of the 17th-century, among them being the famous Labourd witch-hunt of 1609 and the Aix-en-Provence possessions (1611). North West France The North West of present-day France, particularly Lorraine and Franche-Comté (at that time a part of the Holy Roman Empire), was an area strongly affected by witch hunt. About 800 witch trials took place in these areas with numerous executions in the period of 1603-1614 and 1627-1632, and again in France-Comté with 100 executions in 1658-1661.Bengt Ankerloo, Stuart Clark & William Monter: Witchcraft and Magic in Europe, Volume 4: The Period of the Witch Trials End of witch trials Peronne Goguillon has been referred to as the last woman to be executed for witchcraft in France in 1678. There have been different opinions as to whether the Affair of the Poisons (1679–1682) should be defined a witch trial or not. While the accused of the Affair de Poisons had indeed positioned themselves as professional witches, they were prosecuted and executed for poison and murder rather than for witchcraft. The 1682 Edict of Louis XIV of France described witchcraft as fraudulent magic, a definition which did not as such prevent witch trials, but made it more difficult to convict people of witchcraft. Ankarloo, Bengt & Henningsen, Gustav (red.), Skrifter. Bd 13, Häxornas Europa 1400-1700: historiska och antropologiska studier, Nerenius & Santérus, Stockholm, 1987 A few witch trials were conducted in France during the 18th- century, some of which resulted in death sentences for men. The execution of an alleged male sorcerer in Bordeaux in 1718 has traditionally been referred to as the last. However, a donkey-driver and the nobleman des Chauffors were in fact executed for the same crimes in Paris in 1724 and 1726 respectively. The last witch trial resulting in an execution in France was likely that of Louis Debaraz, who was executed in Lyon in 1745. His was executed as the last of several men implicated in the Lyon witch trial in 1743–1745, in which several men were charged with making a Devil's pact in order to find hidden treasures, following the case of Bertrand Guilladot. As late as 1768, a woman was trialed and sentenced for witchcraft in France, but she was only given a fine.

The Spanish were in Florida for almost a century before ranching became widespread in the colony. Late in the seventeenth century, ranches were located along the middle St. Johns River, in Potano Province (present-day North Central Florida), and in Apalachee Province (the easternmost part of the Florida Panhandle). Ranches flourished despite conflicts with the native people of Florida. Attacks by the English colony, the Province of Carolina, and its native allies brought an abrupt end to ranching in Florida at the beginning of the eighteenth century.  Conditions in Spanish Florida  Spanish Florida in the 16th and 17th centuries was a frontier colony. There were only some 2,000 Spaniards in the colony, and between 800 and 1,500 people in the Presidio of St. Augustine. Florida was a poor colony, with no source of precious metals and little else of value to the Spanish. The European population was almost completely dependent on government salaries paid from the situado, an annual subsidy provided to the colony by the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Most goods used by the colonists had to be imported from Cuba and New Spain (Mexico). The situado was often late, sometimes by years, or even skipped. One year the ship carrying the situado was captured by a Dutch privateer. Another year, it was lost in a shipwreck. The small amount of the situado, and the frequent delays in its provision, left the colony constantly short of supplies and funds. The government and the Spanish people of Florida bought goods in Havana on credit, but growing debt caused prices to rise and credit to dry up. The Spaniards of Florida therefore sought means to generate additional income. Products grown or gathered in Florida and shipped to Havana and Spain included ambergris that washed up on the Atlantic coast of Florida, maize and beans from Apalachee Province, and deerskins and furs obtained from the Apalachicola people. However, cattle ranching was, for a few decades, the most successful effort in Spanish Florida to supplement the meager support provided for the colony by the situado.  Early attempts  Juan Ponce de León, Hernando de Soto and Tristán de Luna y Arellano all took cattle with their expeditions to Florida, in line with their intentions to found Spanish settlements there, but there is no evidence that any of those animals survived to reproduce. Pedro Menéndez de Avilés again introduced cattle to Florida when he founded St. Augustine in 1565. For the rest of the sixteenth century cattle were periodically imported from Cuba and placed on islands along the coast near St. Augustine, but shortages of pasture and fresh water and, to some extent, excessive mosquito bites, killed them. Householders in St. Augustine each kept a few cows. A few hundred head of cattle were reported in the town in 1600. The failure to establish herds of cattle meant that 2,000 ducats worth of dried beef had to be imported from Havana yearly. Documentation about ranches in Spanish Florida is scarce, particularly in the first half of the 17th century. Arnade, writing in 1961, stated that there was no evidence of cattle ranching in Florida before 1657, and that cattle ranching in Florida began sometime between 1605 and 1655. It is now known that continuing herds were established in Florida starting in 1618, when governor Juan de Salinas began importing cattle from Cuba in sufficient numbers. Expanses of vacant land became available in Spanish Florida as natives in mission villages died in frequent epidemics, or left their villages to avoid the repartimiento, in which men from mission villages were required to work, without pay, for the Spanish. The Saltwater and Freshwater Timucua villages along the St. Johns River were largely empty by 1617, leaving unused land that could serve for cattle ranches. The earliest reference to a cattle ranch in Florida is for one in Potano Province, possibly dating to the mid-1620s, but Hann speculates that earlier ranches had been established closer to St. Augustine.  Growth  Luis Benedit y Horruytiner became governor of Florida in 1633. He encouraged criollos (people of European descent born in the Americas) in St. Augustine to move to the inland provinces to start farming and ranching, using the native population as laborers. Horruytiner made a significant number of grants of land during his term as governor that were probably used as ranches. Horruytiner stayed in Florida after his term as governor ended, and his family later owned several cattle ranches. A dozen of so criollo families holding administrative and military positions in St. Augustine obtained land grants. Construction of the Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine, which began in 1672, created an increased demand for food for the workers. Pablo de Hita y Salazar, governor of Spanish Florida from 1675 to 1680, also freely distributed land grants, for which he was reprimanded by the Spanish Crown. He also stayed in Florida and became a cattle rancher after leaving office. The best potential pastures in Spanish Florida were grasslands in the Potano Province, 15 leagues west of the St. Johns River. The Potano people had regularly burned their lands to clear them for agriculture and to create better conditions for hunting. The repeated fires converted woodlands to savannas of wiregrass (Aristida stricta). The population of Potano Province started falling soon after the first missions were established there in 1606. Two of the early missions in Potano, San Miguel de Potano and San Buenaventura de Potano, disappeared from Spanish records after 1613, likely because of loss of population. Repeated epidemics struck Spanish Florida, including several between 1649 and 1655, leading governor Diego de Rebolledo to observe in 1657 that plague and smallpox had left few natives alive in Timucua Province (which by then included Potano Province).  Operations  Cattle on ranches were allowed to freely browse in the woods for most of the year. They were gathered up and confined in pens in the spring, where calves were branded, and a portion were selected to go to slaughter. Most of the cattle to be slaughtered were driven to St. Augustine. The cattle sent to St. Augustine initially provided meat for the garrison, with any surplus meat sold to civilians in the city. As ranch production increased, surplus hides, tallow and dried meat became available for export. Some was sent to Spain on the one ship a year that was permitted to sail from St. Augustine to Spain. The rest was shipped to Havana and other cities in the Caribbean. Juan Márquez Cabrera, governor of Florida from 1680 to 1687, ordered that cattle ready for sale were to be slaughtered at a government slaughterhouse in St. Augustine, at a fixed price, and with the payment of a tax. Ranches drew on several sources for workers. Some were repartimiento (involuntary unpaid draft) laborers, procured through the caciques of mission villages. Mission population declines led to ranchers contracting with natives as day laborers, with resettlement of the workers on ranches. Full-time ranch hands included both contract workers and slaves. In the 1660s a company of soldiers was sent from Mexico to Florida to fill up the ranks of the garrison. The Mexican soldiers were mestizos or mulattos, and were regarded in St. Augustine as unfit to be soldiers. Many of them ended up working on ranches. Ranches and farms in Spanish Florida paid a tithe, or tax in kind, of two-and- one-half percent of their produce. Governor Hita y Salazar, needing funds for construction of the Castillo de San Marcos, and for founding new Spanish towns at strategic points in Florida, introduced new taxes on farms and ranches, including an annual tax of 50 pesos for each ranch, and a charge of 50 pesos per league to make the grazing licenses inheritable. The new taxes brought in 2,500 pesos for the government between 1677 and 1685. Inspired by the new taxes imposed by the Spanish government, caciques (native chiefs) began levying a charge on the use of old fields in their chiefdoms, which they called \\"tribute\\".  Menéndez Márquez family  Foremost among the criollos engaged in cattle ranching in Spanish Florida was the Menéndez Márquez family. The family was descended from Pedro Menéndez Márquez, nephew of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, the founder of Spanish Florida. Pedro Menéndez Márquez was the third royal governor of Spanish Florida. Pedro Menéndez Márquez's great-nephew (or, possibly, his grandson), Francisco Menéndez Márquez, was the Royal Treasurer-Steward for Spanish Florida from 1628 until 1637, and again from 1639 until his death in 1649. When governor Benito Ruíz de Salazar Vallecilla was suspended from office in 1646, Francisco Menéndez Márquez and acting accountant Pedro Benedit Horruytiner acted as co-governors until Salazar Vallecilla was returned to office in 1648. By the 1640s Potano Province had become largely depopulated and subsumed into Timucua Province. Francisco started cattle ranching in the abandoned Potano lands, with the approval of Timucua chief Lúcas Menéndez, probably in 1646 or 1647, while acting as co- governor. By 1649 the ranch was worth 8,000 pesos and earning 700 pesos a year. A few years after Francisco's death, the royal treasury in St. Augustine was audited, and it was found that between 16,000 and 20,000 pesos were missing (Francisco's salary as treasurer was 1,470 pesos a year). Bushnell calculates that 6,000 pesos would have purchased about 200 head of cattle, five horses, and two slaves to serve as ranch hands. This sum accounts for much of the 16,000 to 20,000 pesos that Francisco had \\"borrowed\\" from the royal treasury. Francisco's family repaid about three-quarters of the missing funds, and was allowed to repay the balance over six years. Cattle ranching boomed in Spanish Florida in the latter part of the 17th century. Francisco's son, Tomás Menéndez Márquez, and Tomás's son Francisco II, founded or bought most of the ranches located between the St. Johns River and the Potano missions (in what is now western Alachua County). The best known of the ranches was la Chua, on the north side of what is now known as Paynes Prairie. Tomás also formed alliances with other cattle ranchers. Several of his children married into other ranching families. As did other ranches, the Menéndez Márquez ranches sent cattle to St. Augustine. Cattle were sometimes driven to Apalachee Province, as well. A port called San Martin was established in the early 1670s on the Suwannee River, and Tomás shipped hides, dried meat and tallow to Havana from that port. Tomás owned a ship which was engaged in the trade between San Martin, Havana and San Marcos in Apalachee Province.  Conflict with chiefdoms  The natives of Spanish Florida did not take well to cattle ranching in their territories. Resistance to the ranches was part of an ongoing struggle between the \\"republic of Indians\\" and the \\"republic of Spaniards\\" over the control of land and of the labor of the natives. That struggle was complicated by differences between caciques and \\"common\\" natives, and by missionaries supporting native complaints against Spanish ranchers and the Spanish government. Trouble over cattle started with the founding of the colony. At the very beginning of the colony, cattle had to be placed on an island on the coast, where they were protected from native attacks by trained attack dogs. Reports of natives complaining about cattle destroying crops occurred throughout the 17th century. In 1694, the residents of San Diego de Salamototo, the ferry station on the St. Johns River for the trail connecting St. Augustine and Apalachee, were severely short of food after cattle had destroyed their crops. Timucuas sometimes killed cattle to protect their fields, with the earliest report of such killing dating from 1614. During the Timucua Rebellion in 1658, Timucuas raided the Menéndez Márquez family's la Chua ranch, killing four ranch hands (two on the trail and two at the ranch) and all the cattle they could find. Franciscan missionaries to the Apalachee and Timucua resisted Spanish settlements and ranches near native towns as threats to the conversion of natives, as well as threats to the power of the caciques. Another source of conflict was the recruitment of natives as ranch hands. The power of the caciques of Apalachee and Timucua chiefdoms was dependent on their control of land and labor. A sufficient number of subjects working in the fields was required for the production of agricultural surpluses, which gave caciques the means to compete against other caciques, and facilitated the acquisition of prestige goods. Shortages of labor available to ranches through the repartimiento system led to ranchers offering higher wages to voluntary contract workers. This in turn led native men to leave their villages and take up residence on ranches, which deprived their caciques of their labor in the village's fields, and of their availability to meet the repartimiento demands of the Spanish government. It also removed the native men and their families from the Christianizing efforts of the missionaries.  Prosperity, decline and sudden destruction  Late in the 17th century, there were 34 permanent ranches in Spanish Florida. In 1698 and 1699, those 34 ranches paid a tax in kind of 222 head of cattle. The largest ranch, la Chua, paid a tax of 77 head of cattle. The tax rate on the produce of ranches (\\"fruits of the land\\") was two-and-a-half percent. A paid tax of 222 head of cattle implies that 8,880 calves were born in those two years, including 3,080 calves born on the la Chua ranch alone. In 1763, British colonial official James Robertson noted that, before the destruction of the Spanish missions in Florida at the beginning of the 18th century, cattle abounded in Florida, and one Spaniard (presumably, Tomás Menéndez Márquez, whose family owned la Chua) owned 7,000 head. Ranching had become less profitable with time. A beef steer was worth 21 pesos in 1651, but only six pesos in 1689. The value of a horse fell from 100 pesos in 1651 to 25 pesos in 1682. A pair of draft oxen was worth 80 pesos in 1651, but only 25 pesos in 1682. Moreover, the abundance of cattle attracted unwanted attention. French pirates based on Anclote Key on the Gulf coast of Florida raided Spanish ranches in 1682 and 1684, reaching the la Chua ranch in the Potano region both times. Runaway slaves and natives who had left their mission villages killed cattle for food. Native allies of the English Province of South Carolina who participated in the siege of St. Augustine in 1702, retreated through the Potano region, taking cattle, horses and Timucua captives with them to Carolina. By the first years of the 18th century, raids by pirates, rustlers, and the English had severely affected ranching in Spanish Florida. A blockhouse was constructed at la Chua and soldiers were stationed there to help work the ranch and protect it. The pressure of further raids forced the defenders to burn the blockhouse in 1706 and retreat to St. Augustine. The Spanish had lost control of Florida outside of the immediate vicinity of St. Augustine, including the cattle ranches.

The goal of the offensive was to capture major settlements, mainly in South Kivu province in order to raise support for a popular uprising against then-president Joseph Kabila, who the coalition had deemed as an illegitimate president. The offensive culminated in the Battle of Uvira in which rebels attempted to capture the major city, but were eventually pushed out by state security forces. The offensive continued after the battle, but then ended as a counter offensive by the FARDC began in December. Background The CNPSC coalition was brokered by William Yakutumba, a prominent Mai-Mai commander involved in armed rebellion since the 1990s. It unified around 12 Mai-Mai groups into a coalition, aimed at removing the government of Joseph Kabila, who had delayed scheduled elections in late 2016. The idea of the coalition had been around since about 2013, but only became in existence after Kabila's electoral delay. Several armed groups came to be prominent in the group, notably Yakutumba's PARC-FAAL, the Mai-Mai Malaika, and the Uvira hills-based Mai-Mai groups of René Itongwa, Réunion Warusasa, and several others. The Offensive= June  ;1 June The offensive began with rebel forces of Yakutumba's group attacking Force Bendera, the site of a hydroelectric dam in Tanganyika Province. CNPSC forces stormed the area, which was protected by elements of the FARDC, in an attempt to secure weapons. Two FARDC soldiers were killed in the attack, and the rebel forces made off with a large stash of arms and ammunition. ;30 June On June 30th, Congolese Independence Day, the coalition was announced by Yakutumba, who stated his intention to overthrow Joseph Kabila's government, which he called illegitimate. The same day, the coalition attacked and captured the localities of Lulimba, Misisi, Lubondja, and Iseke.  July  ;1 July Heavy fighting erupted south of Fizi town, with the CNPSC occupying several localities. The FARDC claimed that they had the situation under control, and locals stated that they had seen an increased presence of FARDC troops in Fizi town. ;3 July The FARDC reported that they had recaptured some localities under CNPSC control south of the mining town of Misisi in Maniema. ;4 July The CNPSC announced their intention to take the city of Kindu, the capital of Maniema province. In response, the Canadian mining company Banro Corporation announced an evacuation of all personnel from the province, citing security issues and harassment by CNPSC-affiliated militias. ;12 July On July 12, the United Nations estimated that 80,000 people were internally displaced as a result of the fighting between the coalition and government in Fizi Territory. The same day, CNPSC forces ambushed a FARDC convoy from Namoya to Wamaza. ;26 July Armed men likely belonging to a CNPSC militia ambushed a group of FARDC reinforcements travelling from Maniema to Fizi.

According to the FARDC, the withdrawal was to \\"avoid the bloodbath\\". ;28 November The FARDC recaptured Kilembwe from CNPSC forces. It was reported that the FARDC encountered no resistance when capturing the town.  December  ;23 December Militiamen of the CNPSC shot and killed a FARDC soldier in the village of Kikwena. ;26 December General Philemon Yav was selected to become the commander of the Sukola II operation, and would lead military operations against the CNPSC. This date is generally accepted as when the offensive ended, as a large-scale FARDC counter-offensive launched by Yav would begin in the following weeks. Aftermath Following Philemon Yav's appointment as overall commander of Sukola II, the FARDC began a major offensive against the CNPSC rebels which was intended to destroy the group. Heavy losses were inflicted against the group, mainly against Yakutumba's Mai-Mai militia, and the group was falsely labeled as \\"annihilated\\" by the army. In late 2018, another CNPSC offensive would be launched. Towards the end of the offensive, FARDC forces targeted Bembe civilians, who they believed to be CNPSC rebels. Arbitrary arrests of Bembes, specifically young adults, were carried out in Baraka and Uvira. This harassment led to a recruitment spike for the coalition.

History The Chandrakona area was once thickly forested. The earliest rulers of the area were the Ketu dynasty, who possibly ruled up to the 16th century, when they were overthrown by the Chouhan dynasty, also known as Bhan kings. They built several temples in and around Chandrakona. The last Bhan king, Mitrasen, died childless and Raghunath Singh of Bishnupur took over the kingdom. Subsequently, Kirtichandra of Burdwan defeated him and annexed the area. He built many temples in Chandrakona. It came under the rule of British East India Company in 1760. Geography The Malleswara Shiva temple is located at . The temple David J. McCutchion says that the pancha-ratna, along with the at-chala, is the most popular type of Bengal temple, “especially in 19th century Midnapore where it outnumbers all others,” The roof of a ratna temple “is surmounted by one or more towers or pinnacles called ratna (jewel). The simplest form has a single central tower (eka- ratna), to which may be added four more at the corners (pancha-ratna)”. The number of towers or pinnacles can be increased up to a maximum of twentyfive. The ratna style came up in the 15th-16th century. McCutchion classifies the Malleswara Shiva temple as a pancha-ratna with ridged rekha turrets and porch on triple archway. Built of laterite possibly in the 18th century, it has stucco figures and measures 26’ square.McCutchion, David J., Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal, first published 1972, reprinted 2017, pages 8-10, 44, 46. The Asiatic Society, Kolkata, There is another view point worth noting. The Malleswar Shiva temple is one of the oldest temples in Chandrakona. It was in all probability built in the 14th century and was renovated by Maharaja Tejchandra in 1831. The temple originally stood in a fortified compound. There was a double storied gateway and a plate detailed the renovation work done by Maharaja Tejchandra. The gate is in a dilapidated condition and the plate is missing. There was a natmandir till 2017, when it was pulled down by locals with the excuse of being in a bad shape and unsafe. The Jorbangla temple is just 500 m away. It has a height of 60’.

The rubric (red) above the first line reads Incipit hystoria tartarorum. The Tartar Relation (Latin: Hystoria Tartarorum, \\"History of the Tartars\\") is an ethnographic report on the Mongol Empire composed by a certain C. de Bridia in Latin in 1247. It is one of the most detailed accounts of the history and customs of the Mongols to appear in Europe around that time. Circumstances of composition The Relation is one of several reports produced by the Franciscan mission dispatched by Pope Innocent IV to the courts of Batu Khan and Güyük Khan in 1245. This mission was led by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, who was accompanied by Benedict of Poland and the Bohemians Ceslaus and Stephen. During their return journey through Europe, Carpine wrote that they were obliged to hand over drafts of their official report to the curious. The official report by Carpine is known as the Ystoria Mongalorum. In October 1247, Benedict also dictated an account known as the De itinere Fratrum Minorum ad Tartaros. The circumstances of the genesis of the Tartar Relation are unclear, although the date of its completion is known precisely: 30 July 1247. The author, C. de Bridia, is not otherwise known and his first name is initialized in the manuscripts. He describes himself modestly as \\"least among the Franciscans\\". He is generally thought to have been Polish, and his surname may indicate that he came from Brzeg in Poland. Marian Plezia believes he was one of the members of the embassy who stayed at the court of Batu and did not go on to Güyük. In this case, the work is partially based on his own experiences and partially on the reports of his colleagues. George D. Painter, on the other hand, argued that de Bridia wrote the account based on a lecture given by Benedict of Poland, probably in Germany, since the manuscript tradition of the text is associated with the Upper Rhineland. Benedict's own De itinere was written in Cologne. Tadeusz Bieńkowski argues for its composition in Breslau or Cracow. The friars traveled through Poland on their return journey. Others have suggested Prague. Gregory Guzman argues that Benedict must have given lectures in his native Polish, which de Bridia translated into Latin. He borrowed some parts from the Ystoria. Probably Benedict also had a written draft of his own report by then. Manuscripts The Tartar Relation is known from two manuscripts, both also containing the Speculum historiale of Vincent of Beauvais. The earlier dates to 1338–1340 and the later to about 1440. The latter was first brought to public attention in 1965 because it had been bound with the Vinland map, a modern forgery. It is part of the Beinecke collection at Yale University Library. Unlike the map, the Relation was generally accepted by scholars as authentic, although there were dissenters. In 2006, an earlier copy of the text in the Lucerne Central and University Library was brought to public attention (having been catalogued as early as 1959). The start of the Tartar Relation in the Yale manuscript. The rubric above the first line reads Incipit hystoria tartarorum. The Lucerne manuscript (Latin MS P Msc 13.2°) is written in Gothic script. The scribe, Hugo de Tennach, was employed by Peter of Bebelnhein, a teacher in the cathedral of Basel and the prior of Saint Martin's Church in Colmar. He wrote out not only the Tartar Relation but all four volumes of the Speculum. These four manuscripts belonged to the abbey of Pairis until in 1420 they were pawned to the abbey of Saint Urban for 110 Rhenish guilders. The Relation is bound in the fourth volume, although it may once have been part of the third. The Yale manuscript (Beinecke MS 350A) is also associated with the Upper Rhineland and was probably made at Basel. The Lucerne manuscript is all parchment, while the Yale is a mix of parchment and paper. The Yale manuscript is written in bastard cursive. Colophons in the Lucerne manuscript give the title of the work as Hystoria Tartarorum and specify that it is not part of the Speculum historiale, which contains material on the Mongols derived from the Ystoria Mongalorum and the lost Historia Tartarorum of Simon of Saint- Quentin. The Yale manuscript may be a copy of the Lucerne, but it is more likely they both derive from the same exemplar. They certainly belong to the same manuscript family. The title Tartar Relation, coined by Painter for his 1965 edition, has stuck. Content The text of the Relation is almost identical at parts with the Ystoria Mongalorum, but it is not simply a version of Carpine's text. It differs in tone and purpose. Its portrayal of the Mongols (and the Jews) is far more negative. It also lacks the strategic purpose of the Ystoria, preferring to describe the Mongols as divine punishment on Christians. Religious references are pervasive. Gregory Werner propses that the Relation is \\"an eschatological reinterpretation of Carpine's account [and] a complement to [it]\\". The Relation is dedicated to Boguslaus, \\"minister of the [Franciscan] friars who live in Bohemia and Poland\\", and the author claims to be writing in obedience to Boguslaus' authority, suggesting that the text was commissioned. It is an ethnographic report, although it also contains legendary material borrowed from the mirabilia (wonders) genre, perhaps because, as a non-traveler, de Bridia considered them missing from the accounts of the travelers. It reports the existence of dog-face people, ox- footed people and other monstrous races typical of the genre. Another people, the Parossits, appear to be the actual Permians. The Samoyeds are also mentioned. The magnetic island from the legend of Sinbad the Sailor is also incorporated. It is called Narayrgen, which is said to come from the Tatar for \\"Men of the Sun\\". Compared to the Ystoria and Benedict's De itinere, the Relation lacks information on the friars' travels. It is more focused on Mongol history, customs and plans. For its time, its account of Mongol history, genealogies and methods of warfare are among the most detailed. It covers the Mongol invasion of Europe from the 1220s through the 1240s, correctly crediting the invasion to Jochi's command rather than Batu's, as all other western sources do. His account of Genghis Khan's rise, however, is marred by legendary material, such as his encounter with Gog and Magog, inspired by the Alexander Romance. In places, the text of the Relation uses the correct spelling Tataros rather than the corrupt form Tartaros common in Europe. It records that the Mongols called the pope the \\"great pope throughout the West\\" (magnum papam per totum occidentem). Like Friar Julian and the Tractatus de ortu Tartarorum, the Relation portrays the Mongols as operatin on three distinct fronts: against the Sultanate of Egypt, against the Sultanate of Rum (Anatolia) and against the Hungarians and Poles.

It is closely associated with the Okanagan region of British Columbia and Washington. Geography This ecoregion occupies the south-central interior of British Columbia and adjacent Washington state between the Rocky Mountains to the east and the Pacific Ranges to the west. It is composed of gently rolling hills of Tertiary sediments and volcanic rocks between 1220-1525 metres (4000-5000 ft) in elevation. These hills are incised by numerous bodies of water such as the Columbia River, Thompson River, and Okanagan Lake. Climate The ecoregion has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk) with very warm to hot, dry summers and moderately cool winters with little snowfall. A strong elevational gradient in precipitation occurs, ranging from 250 mm (9.8 in) to over 1000 mm (39.4 in) per year. On average, precipitation is in the range of 400 mm (15.75 in) on the plateaus. The mean annual temperature is around 7°C (44.6°F), mean summer temperature ranges from 15°C (59°F) to 16.5°C (61.7°F), and mean winter temperature is around -2.5°C (27.5°F). The driest place in Canada outside of the Arctic is in the Kamloops region of Thompson Country, which falls within the northwestern bounds of this ecoregion. The Okanagan dry forests ecoregion is sometimes referred to as a desert due to its hot, dry climate relative to the rest of Canada. However, it and the neighbouring Columbia Plateau ecoregion near Osoyoos are semi-arid ecoregions and are not true deserts. Ecology=Flora Vegetative cover in this region encompasses forests and grasslands that change in character with increasing altitude. Lower elevations contain communities of ponderosa pine, bluebunch wheatgrass, blue grass, June-grass, and Great Basin sagebrush. Mid-slope elevations are home to communities of Douglas-fir and pinegrass. Higher elevations are home to communities lodgepole pine, quaking aspen, white spruce, and Douglas-fir. Fauna Large mammals that inhabit this ecoregion include American black bear, bighorn sheep, black-tailed and white-tailed deer, North American river otter, American badger, coyote, bobcat, and cougar. Birds that inhabit this ecoregion include California quail, blue grouse, long- billed curlew, and waterfowl. Threats and preservation Agricultural development of the Okanagan Valley near Okanagan Falls Approximately 20% of the Okanagan dry forests remains intact, with most parts having been heavily altered due to clearing of land for agricultural production. Growing urban expansion also threatens this ecoregion, most notably around the cities of Kamloops, Kelowna, and Spokane. Connectivity between grasslands for wildlife is heavily impaired by the development of lowland valleys. Human-caused climate change threatens to increase the frequency and intensity of droughts and wildfires in this ecoregion. Wildfires of note include the 2003 Okanagan Mountain Park fire, 2009 West Kelowna wildfires, and 2017 British Columbia wildfires.

Description On Broad Street looking south down High Street, 1880 The bronze sculpture of Dr. Samuel Mitchel Smith (1816–1874) was sculpted in 1880 by Columbus artist William Walcutt. Smith was the Surgeon General of Ohio during the American Civil War (1862–64) and the 25th president of the Ohio State Medical Society (1869–70). He was also the first professor of psychiatry (or its equivalent) in the U.S., at Willoughby Medical College (later known as Starling Medical College; the present-day Ohio State University College of Medicine). Smith later served as a dean of the school, from 1849 to 1858, and again from 1860 to 1863. The statue measures approximately 6.5 x 2 x 2.5 ft and weighs 900 pounds. It rests on a granite base measuring approximately 8 x 5 x 5 ft and weighing 14 tons. His full-size figure is shown wearing a Prince Albert coat and with his hands folded behind his back. Two sides of the base display bronze oval cameos with profiles of the doctor's two deceased sons, Charles and Samuel. The left side depicts his son Charles who died the same year, 1874, at the age of 21, while the right depicts his son Samuel, who died in 1878 at the age of 30. The front of the base has an animal head above a fountain, formerly operational. It was chosen as the family was impressed with drinking fountain statues they saw in Europe. Smith reportedly preferred the idea of a social, usable drinking fountain over a headstone in a cemetery. The statue's inscription reads \\"Memorial Fountain, to Dr. Samuel Mitchel Smith and His Sons, 1880.\\" In 1994, the statue was valued by the city at $25,000, though its replacement cost would exceed that due to its almost seven-foot height and composition of solid bronze. History Featured in the 1908 Columbus Plan for its original poor placement The Dr. Samuel Mitchel Smith and Sons Memorial Fountain was developed as a memorial to the doctor by his widow and daughters, five years after his 1874 death. It was forged at the Kelby Foundry in New York state. The memorial was originally installed at the southeast corner of Broad and High streets around 1880. It was authorized in 1879, and officially unveiled on Memorial Day in 1881, and was then given as a gift to the city. The statue was a feature of the 1908 Columbus Plan; the statue's placement interfered with traffic, as it was installed on sidewalk sticking out onto Broad Street. This problem, as well as the fountain not functioning and defacement by vandalism, spurred its first move. The Samuel Smith statue in front of St. Francis Hospital as it is torn down, 1957 In 1915, after 35 years, it was relocated to the Starling Medical College (also known as St. Francis Hospital) at the intersection of State and Sixth Streets. The move led the statue's admirers to believe it escaped being adorned with a hat, an occurrence that happened each autumn by an unknown visitor, though the acts continued. The statue stood there for 42 years. Around 1957, the hospital was torn town and replaced by the larger Grant Medical Center. The statue was viewed as being in imminent danger. Columbus City Council's president suggested it be moved to the City Health and Safety Center (the Columbus Health Department offices), where it was temporarily stored in its basement. Several months later, it was placed on its front lawn, at the southeast corner of the Scioto Peninsula, where the statue faced downtown Columbus for 37 years. In 1987, local psychiatrists honored Smith for his pioneering ideas by visiting his statue. The statue was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in 1993. The statue (lowerright), by the Columbus Health Department, 1992 Ohio State University's psychiatry department chair began looking into having the statue relocated to the campus in the mid 1980s. Before this could happen, however, the statue was stolen from its Health Center site. The October 1994 theft led to the statue's sale to an antique dealer in Atlanta, and resale to a dealer in Durham, North Carolina, for $6,800. The statue was then confiscated by Durham police. A Columbus-area former antiques dealer was arrested over the theft. Columbus police claimed he and others were looking to steal a statue of President James A. Garfield. The man was fined and given a 90-day prison sentence. Damage to the statue's shoes indicated its theft to a Columbus-area antiques show promoter who viewed it in Atlanta, who also received a tip that the statue might be the one stolen in Columbus. The statue was returned to Columbus for restoration in December 1994. Following the restoration, the statue was placed at the Harding Hospital, Ohio State's then-new psychiatry building on the Wexner Medical Center campus. The building opened in March 1994 with the statue in mind; a foundation was created at that time for the statue outside its Upham Drive entrance.

Renkl is the author of Late Migrations: A Natural History of Love and Loss. Her weekly opinion columns focus on nature, politics and culture.  Early life  Renkl was born in Andalusia, Alabama and moved with her family to Birmingham, Alabama as a child. Renkl spent much of her childhood out-of-doors, with frequent visits to her maternal grandparents, who remained in lower Alabama. Renkl's mother was descended from peanut farmers and her father was an apartment complex developer. Renkl attended Auburn University, describing herself as an eager and enthusiastic undergraduate student who \\"wanted to learn everything, read everything, think about everything.\\" While a student, she was involved in running a literary magazine, and upon graduation, was accepted into a literature PhD program at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At the time, Renkl had never traveled further north than Tennessee, and found the more northerly climate inhospitable. The program, with a focus on critical theory, was a poor fit for her poetic aspirations. Renkl returned south after one semester and later obtained a masters degree from a graduate writing program at the University of South Carolina.  Career  Renkl taught high school English at Harpeth Hall, a private school in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1987 to 1997. Renkl quit teaching after a difficult pregnancy with her second child, and spent years freelance writing for various publications, including Glamour, Guernica, Literary Hub, Oxford American, and River Teeth. In October, 2009, she founded Chapter16, an online literary magazine featuring Tennessee and Tennessee-adjacent writers. Renkl stepped down as founding editor after ten years. Renkl's work began appearing in The New York Times in 2015, with an essay focusing on care-giving for elderly relatives. Soon after, she was offered a weekly column, with early pieces on the backyard drama of nesting birds and the way the 2016 United States presidential election played out in her local neighborhood. Renkl spent 15 years writing poetry, but eventually focused more on prose after concluding that poetry would \\"require an intensity and concentration that ultimately I just don’t have.\\"  Late Migrations  The raw material for Renkl's 2019 non-fiction book, Late Migrations: A Natural History of Love and Loss, arose from a weekly blog she began as she and her husband dealt with caring for, and the eventual deaths of, Renkl's parents and her husband's mother. The book interweaves short pieces on nature and the natural world with family stories and memories from Renkl's life. Renkl had not originally planned to turn the material into a book, considering the blog as a way to process her grief. \\"I found that I took a lot of comfort from watching the natural cycles in my yard. I didn't actually start writing the nature essays until a few months later, when the primary season for the 2018 election really started gearing up. And all this ugliness was coming out.\\" The book includes original artwork by Renkl's brother, Billy Renkl. The book received generally favorable reviews, though some reviewers found the book hard to characterize.  Influences  Renkl's formal education was mainly focused around poetry, however she eventually settled on her current prose style, including some notably short micro-essays. Renkl names E.B. White, Annie Dillard, Mary Oliver, Wendell Berry and James Agee among those writers who have influenced her own work. In Death of a Cat, Renkl explicitly links an existential understanding of the animal world to E.B. White's Death of a Pig. Danny Heitman of The Wall Street Journal, noted that Renkl's nature writing \\"seems like a belated answer to White\\". Her nature writing has been compared to naturalist writers like Annie Dillard and Peter Matthiessen. Renkl's book, Late Migrations, was selected for Jenna Bush Hager's book club, with Hager comparing the work to that of Mary Oliver.  The South  Renkl is influenced by her upbringing and life in the American south. In an opinion essay, What is a Southern Writer?, Renkl grapples with its meaning, both in her own work and for the canon as a whole, writing: > \\"People can hardly help loving the hands that rocked their cradles or the > landscapes that shaped their souls, but I doubt there’s a single writer in > the South for whom life here isn’t a source of deep ambivalence. And yet all > the writers I’ve mentioned had opportunities to leave — many actually did > leave for a time before returning to stay. It has all made me wonder: What > if being a Southern writer has nothing to do with rural tropes or lyrical > prose or a lush landscape or humid heat so thick it’s hard to breathe? What > if being a Southern writer is foremost a matter of growing up in a deeply > troubled place and yet finding it somehow impossible to leave? Of seeing > clearly the failings of home and nevertheless refusing to flee?\\"  Personal life  Renkl is married to Haywood Moxley, a writer and English teacher. They have three adult sons.

It was built in the 19th century as a home for John Woodall, a prominent local businessman, and then converted and extended for municipal use in 1903. Situated overlooking the South Bay, it is a grade II listed building. History The origins of local government in Scarborough date to a charter granted by Henry II in 1163. An ancient town hall based on Sandside, facing the harbour on a site now occupied by the former Bethel Mission Chapel, moved in 1800 to William Newstead's Assembly Rooms on Long Room Street (now St Nicholas Street). This was the Corporation's seat until 1867, when a new town hall and courthouse were opened in Castle Road. By 1898, this too was considered inadequate and the Corporation sought a new town hall site. The mansion which was to become the town hall was St Nicholas House, which was commissioned by John Woodall – part of a prominent and successful Scarborough family – to replace his previous home, 22 Long Room Street. The date and architect of the construction appears to be contested; research by Scarborough Civic Society suggests it was by Henry Wyatt in 1844, while the listing description from Historic England ascribes it to W B Stewart, 1869–70. It cost approximately £2,300 () at a time when Scarborough's population was 18,377. In 1898 – by which point the population had grown to 33,776 and needed further resources for administration – John Woodall's son, John W Woodall, whose portrait hangs inside the building's foyer, and who had inherited the property in 1879, put forward and sold St Nicholas House to the Corporation. It paid £33,575 () for the building; this price also included other properties on the cliff which have been demolished. The house needed work to make it suitable for use as a town hall, and this was designed by the newly appointed borough engineer and surveyor Harry W Smith in 1898–1903. This involved a new east wing to fit new rooms such as departmental offices and the council chamber. The cost of conversion was about £19,500. A blue plaque on Scarborough Heritage Trail An official opening ceremony took place on 28 July 1903, during which Queen Victoria's youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, formally opened the Town Hall – the ceremonial key used is displayed in a cabinet inside the building – and unveiled a new bronze statue of Victoria by Charles Bell Birch in gardens outside. The memorial statue, which is separately grade II listed, is the only statue of a public figure in Scarborough. Later history Further extensions were made in King Street and St Nicholas Street in 1962–64 in a standard modern office block style. This is used as further accommodation for the borough council and as a \\"customer first centre\\". Scarborough Town Hall is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 8 June 1973. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to \\"buildings that are nationally important and of special interest\\". A proposed plan to sell the Victorian building and move to a new out-of-town purpose-built site was considered by the Conservative-run Scarborough Borough Council in March to July 2012. It was estimated that maintenance of the building could cost £5.7 million over the following 25 years and that an estimated £1.7 million would be needed for an IT upgrade. Though the plan was rejected, the office accommodation was considered too large, in poor condition and costing too much to bring up to standard, leading to a second plan in December 2012 to reduce office space by up to 71 per cent. A sum of £90,000 was invested in a complete replacement of the security system of the Town Hall in 2018. Five of Scarborough Town Hall's historic rooms are licensed for weddings and other civil ceremonies, giving the Council a stream of income to help conserve and maintain it. Architecture The Town Hall takes the form of a Jacobean-style mansion with two-storeys plus attic, of red brick with stone dressings, string courses, cornice and parapet, whose main south front is set on a strapwork balustraded terrace to public gardens. Along this main front are Dutch gabled bays to the left and centre, and to the right, a pair of square turrets with leaded ogee domes, between which is a large stained-glass oriel window. Another Dutch gabled block at the western end forms the main entrance from St Nicholas Street. The doorway is flanked by engaged stone Ionic columns on pedestals, topped by an entablature with a cartouche with pyramid finials. Internally, the Town Hall features a Civic Parlour, Mayor's Parlour, Mayoral Corridor, Committee Room and Council Chamber. These are all lavishly decorated in a style Edwardian municipal grandeur, with plaster ceilings, fine carpets, and hardwood furniture and panelling; the Council Chamber also has an intricate wooden arched ceiling and raised public gallery.

Toronto Star, August 25, 2020. According to Fumero, \\"while I understand the Latina population is [very] small in Quebec (& how many of them are funny actors?) the Amy and Rosa roles could’ve gone to ANY BIPOC so it’s disappointing to see that missed opportunity.\\" Talhi Briones, a Chilean Canadian writer and illustrator, also criticized the apparent whitewashing of Latina characters, as well as expressing concern about whether the series would retain Rosa Diaz's bisexuality. Writing for Le Devoir, Justine Robidas also expressed concern about the show's cast, praising it for casting Haitian Canadian actors Widemir Normil and Fayolle Jean as its versions of Captain Holt and Terry Jeffords, but noting the absence of any significant characters representing Quebec's large Maghreban, Asian or indigenous communities.Justine Robidas, \\"«Escouade 99» ou l’histoire d’un rendez-vous manqué\\".

She was a friend of Federico Fellini, with whom she collaborated for the 1970 film I clowns. She carried out research for the film on the circus and produced the French language version of the dialogue. She also served as assistant director of the 1955 film The Belle of Rome, directed by Luigi Comencini. In the 1960s, she published multiple books, such as Vampires parmi nous, Le Vampire, and Frankenstein & Company. She also collaborated with magazines such as Vogue, Quindici, and Il Delatore. Volta was a specialist on Erik Satie, and in 1981 she founded the Fondation Erik Satie at her home in Paris. In 2000, she donated a large collection of Satie's works to the French National Archives, which entrusted their conservation to the Institute for Contemporary Publishing Archives. Volta organized numerous exhibitions dedicated to Satie, including the foundation of Erik Satie : les Maisons Satie in Honfleur in 1998. A recreation of Satie's room was made in Montmartre, but it eventually had to close due to lack of subsidies in 2008. Ornella Volta was a member of the Carnets de l'Iliad-Club and a Regent of 'Pataphysics. She died on 16 August 2020 in Paris at the age of 93.

Design and description The Type C submarines were derived from the earlier KD6 sub-class of the with a heavier torpedo armament for long-range attacks. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of .Bagnasco, p. 192 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft.

They could reach on the surface and underwater.Chesneau, p. 201 On the surface, the C1s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with eight internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of 20 torpedoes. They were also armed with a single /40 deck gun and two single or twin mounts for Type 96 anti- aircraft guns. They were equipped to carry one Type A midget submarine aft of the conning tower.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 104 Construction and commissioning Ordered under the Rapid Naval Armaments Supplement Programme and built by the Sasebo Naval Arsenal at Sasebo, Japan, I-48 was laid down on 19 June 1943 with the name Submarine No. 378. On 12 December 1943 she was numbered I-48 and Launched. She was completed and commissioned on 5 September 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-48 was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 in the 6th Fleet. She was configured to carry four kaiten manned suicide attack torpedoes on her after deck, two of them with access tubes that allowed their pilots to enter them while she was submerged. On 7 December 1944 she was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in the 6th Fleet, and on 8 December she was assigned to the Kongo (\\"Steel\\") kaiten unit. I-48 completed work-ups in the Seto Inland Sea on 26 December 1944 and proceeded to the naval base at Otsujima. She embarked her kaitens and their pilots there, and on 9 January 1945 became the last submarine of the Kongo unit to get underway for the U.S. naval base at Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands to participate in a kaiten attack on the U.S. fleet there scheduled for 21 January 1945. The Japanese never heard from her again. On 21 January 1945, I-48 was west of Ulithi Atoll proceeding toward the atoll on the surface at when a Tinian-based PBM Mariner flying boat of U.S. Navy Patrol Bombing Squadron 20 (VPB-20) spotted her on radar at 19:30. When the plane tried to ascertain I-48′s nationality, she submerged, and the Mariner attacked her with two depth charges and a Mark 24 \\"Fido\\" acoustic homing torpedo. She survived, but aborted her kaiten attack on the anchorage. After the Mariner′s crew reported the sighting, a hunter-killer group of three destroyer escorts — , , and , with Conklin serving as flagship — from U.S. Navy Escort Division 65 began a search for I-48. The hunter-killer group′s commander made the assumption that I-48 was damaged and would head for Japanese-held Yap at an average submerged speed of . After the group made no contact with I-48, the group expanded its search all the way to Yap on 22 January 1945. At 03:10 on 23 January 1945, I-48 was on the surface northeast of Yap, proceeding southwest at when Corbesier detected her on radar at a range of . Corbesier closed the range and I-48 submerged. Corbesier picked up sonar contact on I-48 at 03:36 and fired a Hedgehog salvo that missed. Conklin and Raby also arrived on the scene. Corbesier fired five more Hedgehog salvoes without scoring any hits, then lost contact. Corbesier regained contact on I-48 at 09:02 and fired another Hedgehog salvo, which missed. Corbesier again gained sound contact at 09:12, but lost it before she could attack again. Conklin, however, was able to launch a Hedgehog attack at 09:34 from a range of . Seventeen seconds later, she heard four or five explosions at an estimated depth of , followed at 09:36 by a violent explosion that knocked out Conklin′s engines and steering gear. Conklin observed huge air bubbles rising to the surface, soon followed by oil, wreckage, and large quantities of human remains. It marked the end of I-48, sunk with the loss of all 122 men aboard — her crew of 118 and four embarked kaiten pilots — at either or , according to different sources. A motor whaleboat from Conklin later recovered pieces of planking, splintered wood, cork, interior woodwork with varnished surfaces, a sleeve of a knitted blue sweater containing human flesh, chopsticks, and a seaman's manual from the water north of Yap. The Japanese 6th Fleet attempted to contact I-48 on 31 January 1945, ordering her to proceed to Kure, Japan. She did not acknowledge the order. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 May 1945.

History Land ownership map of Somervell County in 1884. Both George Barnard's and J.H. Chambers' plots are recorded The community was a companion town to Fort Spunky and was developed on the 8-mile long George's Creek, a tributary of the Brazos River. The land that the community was located on land owned by George Barnard, an owner of several trading posts for Native Americans and the namesake of the aforementioned creek. He bought several thousand acres of land around the area. At the time, the community was part of Johnson County. J.H. Chambers and Norv Randle, the first settlers of the town, came in 1854. A copper and sulfur mine opened during the Civil War. After the war, many families came to George's Creek, most of them farmers. A cotton gin, school, church, and a cemetery operated in the town's business center following the influx of families. It became a part of Somervell County in 1875, following its transfer to Hood County at some point. A year later, a post office serving the community opened. A blacksmith, photography studio, shoe store, barbershop, doctor's office, and a telephone exchange all operated in the community at some point. In the 1880s, two Baptist churches served the community. Cumberland Presbyterian and Methodist congregations also existed. Following the advent of the automobile and paved roads, many residents moved to cities. Smaller farms were merged into large ranches and the population began to decline from 86 in the mid-1920s to 25 in 1960. The post office ceased operations in 1939. A population count in 1988 saw the number of residents rise back to 86. 66 was the recorded population in 2000 and 2010. Every year since 1892, relatives of the early settlers meet at the cemetery and partake in a clean-up, dinner, and reunion on the grounds. Around 400 came in the mid-1970s. The creek proved to be rich in silica and a mine that specialized in the material thrived in the town around 1888. Unimin operates a silica mine on the banks of the creek today. George's Creek Baptist Church was established in 1885, with the sanctuary built in 1915 following various places serving as places of worship for the congregation, including the Methodist church, schoolhouses, and even tents. A video from The Atlantic documented the church and showed its decline from a thriving congregation to averaging an attendance of around six or seven people.

Harden founded the First Baptist Church in Lagos and laid the foundation of the Baptist Academy in Lagos.  Life  Harden was born free to parents who had known slavery, his father was of the Methodist Faith and Harden was baptized as a Methodist before switching to the Southern Baptist Church. Upon his switch, he became a member of the Saratoga Street African Baptist Church in Baltimore. When the Southern Baptist Convention established a Foreign Mission Board to sponsor missionary activities, a mission station was to be established in China and in West Africa, the presence of ex-slaves in Liberia was thought by the Baptist to be a suitable location to convert Africans to Christianity. Harden, a member of a Baptist church in Maryland was nominated by the mission board to relocate to Liberia for missionary duties. Harden's initial experience with mission life in West Africa was demoralizing, his first wife and child died within a year of reaching the shores of Liberia. He took a second wife, a Liberian lady who died at childbirth. But, he was ready to endure to succeed in his endeavour. In Liberia, he befriended John Day, who was in charge of the Baptist Mission, and also spent time with a young American preacher, William Clark who was on his way to Ijaye and James Churchill Vaughan who later played a role in the development of the church in Lagos. Harden transferred services to Lagos in 1855, by then two Southern Baptist missionaries preceded his arrival, Thomas Bowen and William H.

Agronomic advancement had deteriorated under Visigothic rule, but there are eight known agricultural treatises dating from the late 10th century to the mid 14th century. The Andalusi treatises follow the same pattern as Latin agronomic texts: a discussion of soil, water and manure followed by crop science, and sometimes notes on animal husbandry. Six of these are written between the 11th and 13th centuries.Middle East Garden Traditions: Unity and Diversity : Questions, Methods and Resources in a Multicultural Perspective Volume 31 The authors of this body of texts are Ibn al-Wafid, Ibn Hajjaj, Ibn Bassal, Abū l-Khayr, Ibn al-'Awwam, Al-Tighnari and Ibn Luyun. Background Muslims from North Africa crossed the Strait of Gibraltar in 711 and established the Caliphate of Córdoba in the southern part of the Iberian peninsula, which they called Al-Andalus. During their long reign of prosperity, the Muslims created a culture that favored the proliferation of cultural and scientific works, including agronomic works. The Byzantine emperor Constantine VII sent a copy of Dioscorides' pharmacopeia to Caliph Abd al-Rahman III, and also sent a monk named Nicolas to translate the book into Arabic. The first Andalusi botanical garden known from 8th century sources was created in the Palace Al-Munyat al- Rusafa (Arruzafa) of Abd al-Rahman I. Texts The Arabic language agricultural corpus were composed between the 11th and 14th century in Seville, Toledo, Granada and Córdoba. Abū l-Khayr's botanical workUmdat al- tabib fi ma'rifat al-n abat (Medical support for the knowledge of plants by all experts) is the most complete Andalusi botanical text known to modern scholars, containing richer descriptions of plant morphology than other agronomy texts, and detailed information about habitat, plant phenology, uses, cultivars and geographical distribution. Ibn al-Awamm's Kitab al Filaha is considered the most important and encyclopedic of the medieval writings from the European west, but it was relatively unknown in Northwestern Europe until the 19th century when it was first translated into French and Spanish.It contains details on plants like \\"All plants planted in [the walnut's] vicinity show antipathy to it, with the exception of the fig\\". He quotes extensively from the Nabatean Agriculture, and to a lesser extent from earlier Roman and Andalusi authors. These texts were mostly based on Columella's earlier work De re rustica. But they were also influenced by earlier peasant knowledge and contained details about the agricultural practices of al-Andalus, many of which came from the palace gardens or nearby agricultural areas. As such they contain details about Ummayad Córdoba's aristocratic gardens. There is some information of how new species like the Syrian pomegranate were adapted to Al- Andalus. The Syrian pomegranate was brought to Al-Andalus by a returning ambassador where it was planted in Bunila (modern day Casarabonela, Malaga) in 780 AD. Ornamentals The taxonomy criteria of these medieval texts is different then what is used today. Plants with similar external appearance usually fall under the same species name, though in modern taxonomy they are considered different. Many plants were cultivated as ornamentals, but agricultural treatises don't clearly differentiate between decorative plants in gardens and plants with other uses sown in fields and orchards. Ibn Luyun, following al-Tighnari, devotes several chapters to alimentary seeds with culinary uses as spices or vegetables, followed by a section on plants that that he describes as maslayat, which carries connotations of amusement or peacefulness. Ibn Luyun says there are some plants culivated for tasliya (delight) primarily for their scent or visual appearance, or as ornamentation (li-l-zina) planted in the domestic gardens (basatin). Ibn Luyun is exception, and most treatises classify species based on morphological ualities like aroma, and the color and shape of flowers. Pinus pinea (Sanawbar) was planted along walls to create a more beautiful appearance and placed at the center of a pool to provide shade. Cupressus sempervirens, (Sarw, sarwal) - was also a decorative plant used along garden walls for appearance, near the gate, pool, and along paths and angles. (Decorative cypress trees are still a common feature of Mediterranean gardens in modern times.) Colocasia esclulenta, (Qulqas) was planted next to water sources and ponds for its appearance. Lilium candidum was grown as ponds for its aroma and beautiful appearance. Crocus sativus, (Za 'faran) was noted by Andalusi writers for its aromatic quality. Many species of narjis (narcissus) are identified, and yellow narcissus is noted for its appearance and aroma, but not all are considered valuable as ornamental plants. Of the many species of Nymphaeaceae (Nilufar), al-'Awwam mostly discusses the white water lily (nilufar abyad) References Category:Andalusian culture Category:Agriculture ","title":"Andalusi agricultural corpus"},{"id":"65014859","text":"Escadrille Spa.69 (originally named Escadrille N.69) was a French fighter squadron derived from one of its military's oldest aviation units.

The guide was sent to listeners in advance, and contained readings and discussion questions related to the week's broadcast. The National Farm Radio Forum was a weekly radio show that aired on the CBC from 1941 until 1965. The program was targeted at rural audiences, who were encouraged to form local listening groups (\\"forums\\"). Forums would meet weekly to listen to the broadcast together and discuss its content. The program was praised for its effectiveness as a form of adult education, and for encouraging socialization and community improvement projects. In 1949, at the height of its popularity, the Farm Radio Forum had over 1,600 registered forums comprising over 21,000 registered listeners. It aired 20 weekly 30-minute broadcasts per year, from November to March.  Background  The National Farm Radio Forum was the result of a partnership between three recently created organizations: the Canadian Association for Adult Education, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. It was intended to improve the dire condition of farming families in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930's. Provinces had previously experimented with sending university-educated experts to instruct farmers in scientific farming techniques, but this was considered to have been ineffective.  Forum format  A typical local forum consisted of between 10 and 30 individuals. Meetings would typically rotate between the homes of members, though they could also be held in a local church or community hall. Before the Monday broadcast, members received a supplementary publication called the Farm Forum Guide by mail, which they were encouraged to read in advance. After listening to the half hour broadcast together, the forum would engage in discussion. The Guide included a set of suggested questions for discussion for each broadcast. For example: \\"Has the war caused a farm labour shortage in your community? Has the farm labor shortage affected production?\\" The forum's secretary would summarize the group's response, and it would be mailed to the provincial office. The provincial office would then read selected feedback on the following week's broadcast. Summaries of forum feedback would also sometimes be forwarded to government agencies.https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/farm-radio-forum In addition, meetings would often include time for short speeches and socialization, often centred around card games.  Content  Each week's broadcast was themed around a particular issue. A wide range of topics were covered, some relating directly to farming (soil erosion, mechanization, tariffs), but also including more general topics of interest to rural audiences, including health, the family, and the household. Women were encouraged to accompany their husbands to meetings, and certain broadcasts were specifically devoted to \\"women's issues\\", including titles such as: \\"Farm Women in Public Life\\", \\"More Attractive Homesteads\\", and \\"The Teacher in the Community\\". Content was delivered in a variety of formats. Early broadcasts made heavy use of dramatizations, with actors playing neighbours on the fictional \\"Sunnybridge Farm\\", who would discuss the pros and cons of the week's topic. The show also used panel discussions, speeches, and interviews.  Decline  The National Farm Radio Forum reached its height of popularity around 1949. The show's subsequent decline has been attributed to the contemporaneous decline in Canada's rural population, the displacement of family farms by big business agriculture, and the diverging aims of the three organizations behind the Forum (the CAAE, CBC and CFA). The program went off the air in 1965.  Legacy  The show's success inspired a study commission by UNESCO, which resulted in a detailed and complimentary report published in 1954. Though not the first of its kind, the show served as a model for similar community listening groups in countries such as India, Ghana, and France. A number of founding National Farm Radio Forum went on to form Farm Radio Forum International in 1979, a non-profit dedicated to promulgating the format internationally. The Farm Radio Forum was praised for spurring thousands of \\"Action Projects\\" across communities. Examples included co-operative hospitalization schemes, fighting insect infestations, extending telephone service, and the creation of cooperative enterprises, such as credit unions, creameries, and mutual fire insurance.

Picking up from its predecessor series, Fantastic Fears, Fantastic Comics started its issue numbering at 10, rather than 1, and was comprised primarily of Horror comics, with other genres such as Science fiction, War, and Adventure being present in its other stories. In the wake of 40's-50's sentiments, Fantastic Comics likely saw a crackdown by the public, the government, and the industry, as its story content can be speculated to have violated various elements of the Comics Code Authority's 1954 code, and with these reactions, and the decline in sales they presented, the book likely ceased publication after its January/February 1955 issue. Following its suspension, Fantastic Comics was superseded in issue number by the Ajax-Farrell issues of Samson in April 1955. Noted Professionals During its run, Fantastic Comics, and its predecessor series, Fantastic Fears, had a number of notable professionals from the comic book industry working on its various issues and stories, among them are Frank Belknap Long, who produced the script for the story \\"Druid's Castle\\" in Fantastic Fears #3 (September 1953), Steve Ditko, who produced the pencil work and ink for the story \\"Stretching Things\\" in Fantastic Fears #5 (January 1954), Ken Battefield who produced the pencil work for the story \\"Green Horror\\" in Fantastic Fears #8 (July/August 1954), and Ben Oda who produced the lettering for the aforementioned story \\"Stretching Things\\" from Fantastic Fears #5 (January 1954). Content Being a Pre-Code comic book anthology, much of the content found in both Fantastic Comics and in its predecessor series, Fantastic Fears, likely went against much of the sensibilities of society at the time, as several of its horror and horror Esq stories featured content involving violence, horror tropes, mild sexuality and other content that most weren't ready for at the time. In particular, stories such as \\"Gravestone for Gratis\\" from Fantastic Comics #11 Fantastic Comics #11, for example, which featured a character known as the \\"Banbury Ghoul\\", who is an undead ghoulish figure that feasted on corpses, violated the Comics Code Authority's 1954 code of \\"Scenes dealing with, or instruments associated with walking dead, torture, vampires, ghouls, cannibalism, and werewolfism are prohibited.\\", while other stories, such as \\"If a Body Kill a Body\\" from Fantastic Fears #9Fantastic Fears #9, violated the Comics Code Authority's code of \\"Sex perversion or any inference to same is forbidden\\", via its display of subtle or inferred sexual intimacy between its characters on its title page. This content, among other undesirable content, as cited by Frederic Wertham, landed many horror and crime based comic publishers in heavy controversy at the time, and lead to swift repercussions from both the government and the public, strangling sales and forcing publishers to cancel crime and horror type books, based on both reputation and local government mandates, as was the case in Oklahoma City, and Houston, which each placed bans on crime and horror comic books. In regards to Fantastic Comics, the controversy could potentially be said to have caused the title to cease in 1955, as its violations of the Authority's 1954 code, the reputation garnered of these type of genre titles by society and the government, and the strangling of sales due to all of the factors above, likely forced its publisher, Ajax-Farrell, to cancel the title in response, in order to salvage its image. Reprints Following its discontinuation in 1955, a number of stories from Fantastic Comics and its predecessor series Fantastic Fears, were reprinted over the years by other publishers such as Eerie Publications' in their series, Terror Tales, and IDW in their title, \\"Ghosts: Classic Monsters of Pre-Code Horror Comics\\". Among them are the stories, \\"Gravestone for Gratis\\", which was reprinted in Terror Tales v1#7 (March 1969) from its debut in Fantastic Comics #11 (January/February 1955), \\"The Tiger's Paw\\", reprinted in Terror Tales v4 #4 (June 1972), from its debut in Fantastic Comics #11 (January/February 1955), \\"Fate Laughs At Clowns\\", which was reprinted in Terror Tales v3 #5 (September 1971), from its debut in Fantastic Comics #10 (November/December 1954), \\"Scream No More, My Lady\\", reprinted in Terror Tales v1 #10 (November 1969), from its debut in Fantastic Comics #10 (November/December 1954), and \\"If a Body Kill a Body\\", reprinted in \\"Ghosts: Classic Monsters of Pre-Code Horror Comics\\" (2019), from its debut in Fantastic Fears #9 (September/October 1954).

The complex was composed of numerous lightning-sparked fires, most of which were small. However, while they initially started separate from each other, the Hennessey Fire eventually grew to merge with the Gamble, Green, Markley, Spanish, and Morgan Fires, scorching by itself, for a total burn area of in the complex. The fire, which burned in the hills surrounding several large cities, such as Fairfield, Napa, and Vacaville, destroyed 1,491 structures and damaged a further 232. In all, six people were killed and another five injured. The LNU Lighting Complex is currently the fourth-largest wildfire in the recorded history of California. Name The name of the complex fire refers to the name of the local unit of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), the Sonoma–Lake–Napa Unit (LNU). Timeline In the early morning hours of Sunday, August 16 through Monday, August 17, a series of highly unusual thunderstorms rolled through most of northern California, which came from the moisture of the diminishing Tropical Storm Fausto. With these thunderstorms came a reported 10,849 lightning strikes that – within a 72-hour period – had then presumably sparked 376 known fires across much of the state. Monday, August 17 Early on Monday, August 17, at around 6:40 am PDT a spotfire was reported burning in the 60 block of Hennessey Ridge Road near Lake Hennessey which was initially dubbed the 14-3 Fire but then later named the Hennessey Fire. The incident was reported alongside several other fires burning not far from it, most notably the Gamble Fire which began burning in an area off Berryessa Knoxville Road north of Lake Berryessa and west of state Highway 16, the Spanish Fire which was burning near Spanish Flat, the 15-10 Fire burning near the Putah Bridge and the Markley Fire near the Monticello Dam. All of which had been reportedly burning almost completely unchecked as resources meant to combat the incidents had been stretched thin due to the onslaught of new and persisting fires throughout the state. Due to this factor, the fires were not contained during their most critical early phases, and by the evening of that day, the multiple conflagrations sizes were all ranging between 1,000 and 8,000 acres with 0% containment for each fire. Tuesday, August 18 The Hennessey Fire as seen from Sonoma. By the morning of August 18, the complex of fires burning through much of the Napa County region had already expanded to collectively encompass over 12,000 acres. By this time, only several hundred firefighters were actively engaging the firelines. Air attack reported additional spotfires beginning to flare up due to the deteriorating weather conditions as between at least 20 to 30 new fires that had been ignited by lightning the day prior were discovered. One of those ignitions was the actively expanding Walbridge Fire (then the 13-4 fire) that had started in rugged hills north of the Austin Creek State Recreation Area of Sonoma County and was now 75 acres in size with vitally no firefighter apparatus engaging the fire. Evacuation warnings were put in place for the rural area in the hills between Healdsburg and Stewarts Point as the fire burned virtually unchecked. Those evacuations were then expanded to include areas east of Sewell Road and King Ridge Road; north of Old Cazadero Road and Austin Creek; west of East Austin Creek and Wal Bridge Ridge; and south of Stewarts Point Skaggs Springs Road --as well as Guerneville, Monte Rio and other areas north of the Russian River-- which displaced hundreds of residences by nightfall as the fire grew to 500 acres. Meanwhile, a 15 acre fire had also been spotted burning between Meyers Grade and Highway 1 north of the community of Jenner after being caused by lightning the day prior and would later be dubbed the Meyers Fire as it also rapidly expanded in the area. Mandatory evacuations were put in place for areas west of Meyers Grade Road, south of Fort Ross Road and North of the intersection of Meyers Grade Road and Highway 1 throughout the day. Evacuations orders that initially were put in place for roads near the Hennessey Fire off of Hennessey Ridge Road and Highway 128 and along Chiles Pope Valley Road and Lower Chiles Valley Road began to expand for much of the surrounding Lake Berryessa area as the fire and multipule other conflagrations effectively exploded in size in that area. These mandatory evacuations were put in place for the Berryessa Highlands and Spanish Flat areas as the fires rapidly raged towards those communities. By this time, the Hennessey Fire has reportedly only destroyed one structure and two outbuildings in the area and threatened 205 structures, however an additional 390 homes in the Berryessa Estates area were now reportedly threatened and multiple structures were reported burning throughout the valley. Later that afternoon, the fire further threatened additional rural areas along Highway 128 as it jumped the two-lane winding highway twice and it raced towards the Vaca Mountains bordering Napa and Solano County. At 8:15 pm on Tuesday night, CAL FIRE has reported that the Hennessey Fire had consumed 10,000 acres, the Gamble Fire off of Berryessa Knoxville Road has also consumed 10,000 acres, the Spanish Fire near Spanish Flat had grown to 1,000 acres, the \\"15-10\\" near Putah Creek Bridge had burned 8,000 acres, and the newly-ignited Markley Fire near the Monticello Dam had also grown to 2,500 acres. All zero percent contained that night. By 11:30 pm, the Hennessey Fire was seen still burning at a critical to dangerous rate of spread as the massive conflagration had traveled 13 miles to the southeast scorching the Vaca Mountains and rolled down the canyons towards the city of Fairfield and Vacaville. This dangerous fire spread spurred additional mandatory evacuations for north Fairfield and northwest Vacaville as the fireline made its way down Mix Canyon Road to Pleasants Valley Road and proceeded to destroy hundreds of structures in areas to the west and north of the cities. September In September, fire activity decreased significantly within the complex, as firefighters brought most of the fire complex under control. By mid-September, only the Hennessey and Walbridge Fires were still burning within the complex. On October 2, 2020, CAL FIRE reported that the entire complex had been extinguished.

He previously served as the voivode and governor of Łódź Voivodeship from 8 December 2015 to 11 November 2019. Biography=Early life and studies Rau was born on 3 February 1955 in Łódź (English: Lodz), in central Poland. In 1977, he graduated from law at the University of Łódź and then briefly worked as a librarian. In 1980, he joined the free trade union \\"Solidarity\\" which opposed communism. Since 1982, Rau attained the Doctor of Juridical Science degree from Łódź University and occasionally taught at institutions of higher learning in Germany, Great Britain, Australia and the United States. Most notably, Rau was employed and worked at the Max Planck Society in Göttingen, Trinity College in Cambridge and at the University of Texas in Austin. In 1995, he became an academic at his native Łódź University. In 1998, Rau was hired as the spokesman and assistant to the rector at the university's faculty in Tomaszów Mazowiecki. In 2007, he was nominated as the first director of the Alexis de Tocqueville Center for Political and Legal Thought. Political career Rau supported the candidacy of Lech Kaczyński from the Law and Justice party in the 2005 Polish presidential elections. In the same year, he assumed the role of senator at the Polish Senate, the upper house of the bicameral parliament in Poland. Rau also represents Poland at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and is a member of the European Conservatives Group and Democratic Alliance since March 2020. On 8 December 2015, he was nominated as the voivode and governor of Łódź Voivodeship, one of Poland's sixteen administrative provinces. Upon being nominated a member of parliament (Sejm), his term as voivode concluded in November 2019. Simultaneously, he became the lead delegate and head of the Polish Committee on Foreign Affairs. In August 2020, he replaced Jacek Czaputowicz as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Political views Rau holds conservative views; he is an ardent and outspoken supporter of the Law and Justice party which propagates right-wing populism. Whilst voivode, he imposed the policy of complete decommunization in the Łódź Province. He is also critical of the LGBT social movements and left-wing politics. In 2018, Rau called for the immediate removal of Hanna Zdanowska from her position as city mayor of Łódź. Zdanowska, a member of the opposing Civic Platform party, was accused of corruption, but had overwhelming support from the city's residents and was predicted to win in the upcoming elections. Rau's decision, which was viewed by some as highly controversial and dictatorial, did not come into effect.

The franchise was introduced in 2002 with Divine Divinity. The franchise received more mainstream attention following the critically and commercially successful release of Divinity: Original Sin (2014). Main games=Divine Divinity (2002) Development of Divine Divinity started as Divinity: The Sword of Lies. The game was based on developer Larian Studios's cancelled project, The Lady, the Mage and the Knight, and it was inspired by Diablo. According to studio founder Swen Vincke, the publisher rushed Divine Divinitys development and released the game \\"unexpectedly\\". At that time, Vincke was still on press tours promoting it and did not know that the game, which required more work, were released. The game received generally positive reviews upon release and it sold very well. However, the contract agreement with the publisher meant that Larian did not earn any money from the game as the game was not commercially successful enough. Larian nearly closed its doors following the release of the game. Beyond Divinity (2004) Vincke reassembled the development team to make a sequel to Divine Divinity, and the main goal for this release was to \\"make money\\". The development for the game was also rushed, with quests being rewritten and features being removed so that the game could release on time. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, and it is considered to be one of the weaker games in the series. Divinity II (2009) While the first two installments in the series were isometric role-playing games, the team wanted to step up and make a 3D action role-playing game. The team was impressed by the production value behind Xbox 360 games and therefore, decide to make an \\"ambitious\\" game for that platform. Bethesda Game Studios agreed to license their Gamebryo engine for Larian to make the game. Divinity II: Ego Draconis was released in 2009, and the publishers rushed the game's development again as they were under the pressure of bankruptcy during the 2009 financial crisis. The game received mixed reviews upon release. An updated version for the game, titled The Dragon Knight Saga, was released in 2010 and published by Focus Home Interactive. The Dragon Knight Saga received generally positive reviews, a significant improvement over Ego Draconis. It also sold fairly well. Divinity: Original Sin (2014) Using the funds from venture capitalists, the team wanted to create a turn-based strategy game for Xbox Live Arcade. The team saw the opportunity of making a 3D isometric role-playing game since there were not a lot of these games on the market. However, despite the team wanting to expand the game's scope, many of its staff were reassigned to finish Dragon Commander, which was not very profitable for the company. As the studio was working on the game, they wanted to expand its scope, but the studio was slowly running out of money. According to a studio member, Original Sin was the \\"do or die\\" project for Larian. A crowdfunding campaign was launched on Kickstarter on 27 March 2013 so that the team would have additional budget to polish the game. The Kickstarter was successfully funded by 26 April, raising almost $950,000, with donations from other sources bringing the total to over $1,000,000 of the game's final budget of €4 million. The game was made by about 35-40 people. The game received very positive reviews when it was released in 2014, and an Enhanced Edition for the game was published by Focus Home in the following year for consoles. Divinity: Original Sin II (2017) Following the success of Original Sin, the studio decided to expand their team to about 130 in order to make a sequel. Larian returned to Kickstarter to secure additional funds for the game's development. Despite being financially stable, Larian returned to crowdfunding again so that they can gather community opinion and further expand the scope of the game. Ultimately, the Kickstarter campaign was a big success, with over 2 million dollars collected in total. The game was released as an early access title in 2016, and the full release came in the following year. The game received critical acclaim upon release, and it was regarded as one of the best role- playing games of all time. Spin-offs=Divinity: Dragon Commander (2013) Following multiple unpleasant experiences with publishers, the team decided to approach venture capitalists directly to fund the game's development. Dragon Commander is a spin-off title, which expanded the dragon combat featured in Divinity II. It is a real-time strategy game and it received generally mixed reviews from critics. Dragon Commander was not a very profitable game, according to Vincke. Divinity: Fallen Heroes (on hold) Larian Studios partnered with Logic Artists to create a tactical role-playing game based on the series. Originally scheduled to be released in November 2019, it was put on hold indefinitely a month before the scheduled release date as Larian stated that the game required significantly more development time and resources. Other media Larian partnered with Lynnvander Studios to make Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game.

It is hosted by the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery. The event is notable for being regularly attended by Australian high society. Among regular attendees of the dinner are political leaders (e.g. the Australian Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition); as well as staffers, journalists, celebrities, and prominent members of the business community. Organizers of the event describe its purpose as to 'bring together the journalistic, political, and corporate chiefs of Australia', in a night of 'entertainment, networking opportunities, and charity'.  Event details  The event is loosely modeled upon the White House Correspondents annual gala dinner held in Washington DC. It is held in the third week of June each year. The dress code is black tie, and the traditional venue is the Great Hall of Parliament House. Tickets are unavailable to members of the general public. Requests for tickets may only be made by full-time residents of either the Press Gallery, or Members of either of the Houses of Parliament and their staff. The number of attendees to the event is strictly limited to a total of 640, due to the limited capacity of the Great Hall and for reasons of exclusivity. A speech is given at the event by the incumbent prime minister and the leader of the opposition. Function rules prior to 2019 prohibited the reporting of speech contents by attendees (although this protocol was occasionally breached). Starting from the 2019 ball onwards the speech has been publicly broadcast.  Charitable auction tradition  Politicians attending the ball have traditionally raised money for charity, through auctioning access to their time. For example, in 2014 then-prime minister Tony Abbott raised $15,100 for charity through auctioning a dinner with him. Another notable bid was $3,000 raised from a forestry association in return for a dinner with the Australian Greens. As of June 2020, the ball has raised a total of $4.5M in charitable contributions over its 20 years of events.  Themes  Each year, the event is organized around a particular theme. The first Midwinter Ball, held in 2000, had the theme 'Inaugural Cabaret'. The other themes have been: * Winter Wonderland (2001) * Year of the Outback (2002) * Parliamentary Circus (2003) * The Opulence of the Orient (2004) * The Australian Dream (2005) * Showgirl (2006) * 18th Century Splendour (2007) * All that Glitters (2008) * 10th Anniversary (2009) * Kick Up Your Heels!

Journalists known have attended the event include Latika Bourke, Laura Tingle, Annabel Crabb and David Speers.  Controversies  The Midwinter Ball has been the venue for a number of reported controversies in Australian public life. A staffer to a lower house MP had his career ended after allegedly groping a woman at the event. It has also been reported in The Australian that Kevin Rudd's speech to the Midwinter ball as prime minister was 'so unfunny it surely contributed to his political demise a few days later. An impersonation of Donald Trump made by then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull caused a minor diplomatic stir in 2017 after being recorded and leaked. The recording of the speech was criticized by politicians on both sides of the aisle, some decrying the recording as 'unethical', while others described the incident as having 'damaged politicians' belief in the mid-winter ball as somewhere they can let their hair down'. The incident led speeches being broadcast publicly from the 2019 event onwards. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's speech to the ball a few weeks after becoming prime minister, was infamously heckled by Senator Sarah Hanson-Young who shouted 'bring back Malcolm' throughout his speech.https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/sep/13/coalition- labor-morrison-shorten-dutton-women?page=with:block-5b999789e4b0761badf41a6f  See also  * Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery * White House Correspondents' Association * White House Correspondents Dinner  References  Category:Dining events Category:Annual events in Australia Category:Culture of Canberra ","title":"Midwinter Ball"},{"id":"65016493","text":"Clio Art Fair is an international contemporary art fair staged bi-annually in New York City, USA.

Although the dominant religion in Ecuador is historically Roman Catholicism, in recent decades, other Christian denominations have gained adherents there, specially from Pentecostal protestant denominations. Currently, there are two canonical Eastern Orthodox communities in Ecuador, the Serbian and Russian. Besides that, there are also two Old Calendarist, non-canonical, Orthodox communities operating in the country that belongs to Ukraine and Greece. Although there are no exact figures for the number of Orthodox faithful in the country, according to a report by the newspaper El Universo in 2017, it is estimated that there are at least more than 400 parishioners in Guayaquil, mostly descendants of Palestinians, in addition to people converted to Orthodoxy. However, the activities of the Orthodox Church in Ecuador are few due to the growth of evangelical denominations, the entrenchment of the Roman Catholic faithful, in addition to the attempts of various jurisdictions of the Roman Catholic Church in the country to warn their parishioners of the activities of other denominations called catholic, as it has happened within the Old Catholic Church and the Episcopal Church.  Serbian  Eastern Orthodox Christianity arrived in Ecuador through the immigration of people from Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon. Many of those immigrants were Maronite Catholics, faithful to Rome who later switched to the Latin Rite after assimilation and after failed attempts to establish a Maronite Rite church. During the 1960s, a group of people from Guayaquil, descendants of Palestinians, began to organize to form an Orthodox community called Fundación Cultural Católica Apostólica Ortodoxa Santa María, whose goal was to form an Orthodox church in Guayaquil. On December 12, 1981, the first Orthodox church in Ecuador was created under the Antiochian Patriarchate. In 2012, the church became part of the Serbian Patriarchate. Currently, the parish called \\"Anunciación de Santa María\\" is located in Central Urdesa, in Guayaquil, under the command of archimandrite Rafael Chepernich. In addition, the parish has a site where an Orthodox church has begun to be built. As of August 2020, that construction has been stopped.  Russian  Since 2007, there has been an Orthodox church that belongs to the Russian Patriarchate, it is under the command of archpriest Alexei Karpov. However, the church is ethnic since its divine liturgies are mostly performed in Russian. In 2009, during his meeting with the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Kirill, Rafael Correa, former president of Ecuador, showed the church's intentions to build a church in Quito.

Biography His father, , was a well known painter and provided him with his first lessons. He had his debut at the Salon in 1834. This was followed by a trip to Brittany and London in 1835. While in England, he was taken by a bit of Anglomania and began spelling his last name with a \\"y\\". The paintings he displayed at the Salon of Dijon, in 1837, were the first to be signed in that style.Pierre Sánchez, Les salons de Dijon, 1771-1950 : Catalogue des exposants et liste de leurs œuvres, L'Échelle de Jacob, 2002 ) His children would retain the spelling. In 1845, the city of Le Havre asked him to help organize the new city museum, and he became its first curator.Charles Lhullier, Musée du Havre : Catalogue peinture, sculpture, dessins, Maudey et Godefroy, 1887 While serving in that role, he met the young painter, Eugène Boudin, and became his sponsor. In 1851, he was able to obtain a grant from Le Havre that would enable Boudin to study in Paris.Gilbert De Knyff, Eugène Boudin raconté par lui-même : sa vie, son atelier, son œuvre, Éditions Mayer, 1976 In 1859, he was named a Knight in the Legion of Honor. Despite these successes, his paintings always fared poorly. One had been refused at the Salon of 1841. His \\"View of Marseille\\", exhibited at the Salon of 1861, was scathingly dismissed by the painter and critic, .Charles-Olivier Merson, Exposition de 1861 : La peinture en France, E. Dentu Online After that, his financial situation worsened considerably. On one occasion, he was caught putting his signature on some of Boudin's works.Pierre Angrand, Histoire des musées de province au xixe siècle : La Normandie, vol. 2, Le Cercle d'Or, 1985 ) When he died, a large part of his debt was paid by selling the paintings he had loaned to the museum in Le Havre, depriving it of much of its collection.

It was started following the 2016 presidential election as \\"Draft Bernie for a People's Party.\\" Bernie Sanders declined becoming the party's figurehead, instead again seeking the presidential nomination within the Democratic Party process. Convention The organization held a virtual People's Convention on August 30, 2020. The convention was covered live and viewed by 400,000 people on various social media platforms.https://yr.media/news/over-politics-hold-up-the-peoples-party- wants-you/ Speakers at the convention included former 2020 presidential election candidate Marianne Williamson, Harvard University professor and philosopher Cornel West, Sanders 2020 co-chairman Nina Turner, former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura, journalist Chris Hedges, and podcasters Jimmy Dore and Ryan Knight. The ultimate goal of the convention is intended to be to \\"vote on forming a major new political party free of corporate money and influence.\\" Background A Gallup poll in 2017 indicated 61 percent of the US wants a competitive third party, while support for the current Democratic and Republican parties were at an all-time low. In addition, progressives have accused the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee of actively working to keep progressive candidates off the ballot in favor of moderate or conservative-leaning candidates. When challenged, the DNC claimed in court that they had the right to do so. The national coordinator of the movement is Nick Brana, who previously worked with the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign as the National Political Outreach Coordinator. In 2018, the Movement for a People's Party posted this mission statement: The movement maintains in its website FAQ that the left- most main party, the Democratic Party, has policies dictated by \\"billionaires and corporations\\" that help finance it, operates undemocratically and cannot be reformed. As for joining an existing third party, MPP feels that the progressive Green Party, to its disadvantage, is perceived as a \\"niche environmental party\\"; MPP aspires to be a coalition of people with broader societal concerns, and that a new movement offers the energy and innovation to make a greater impact. The group has an eight-point plan of how to affect change. # Change hearts and minds, unify around a revolutionary progressive platform, activate people to build a mass movement. # Organize around progressive issues and initiatives with allied groups to network the movement, unions and organizations into a coalition. # Partner with and endorse independent candidates to be leaders in forming a new party. # Attract stellar independents and pull progressive organizations and influencers out of the Democratic Party into a party that truly supports them. # Launch state parties in the most progressive and independent states. # Run inspiring candidates and build a bench of elected officials. # Network our state parties into a nationally viable people's party. # Wipe away the old system and bring the people's platform to life. Future plans While many of the speakers at the convention expressed frustration and distaste for the candidates for the 2020 presidential election, The organization will not contest the 2020 election and instead plans to form a party in 2021, run in the midterms in 2022 and possibly run a presidential candidate in 2024.

The yeshivas therefore escaped to Vilnius in Lithuania at the advice of Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzenski. In Lithuania, the yeshivas were able to function fully for over a year and many of the students survived the Holocaust because of their refuge there, either because they managed to escape from there or because they were ultimately deported to other areas of Russia that the Nazis did not reach. Many students however did not manage to escape and were killed by the Nazis or their Lithuanian collaborators.  Background  Before the second World War, there were many yeshivas in Eastern Europe, mostly in what is present-day Belarus and Lithuania as well as Poland, and what was then mostly the Second Polish Republic and Lithuania. These include the yeshivas of Mir, Slabodka, Telshe, Radin, Lomza, Kaminetz, Kletsk, Grodno, Baranovich, and Bialystok. Thousands of students flocked to Eastern Europe from all over the world, mostly from local locations, but also from Sweden, the United States, Germany, England, Belgium, and more, to study in the famous yeshivas, under venerable roshei yeshiva.  Escape to Vilnius  Vilnius, early 1900s At the outbreak of World War II in September, 1934, the Nazis overran Poland before partitioning it with the Soviet Union. Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski then sent out an urgent message to all the yeshivas that had just fallen under Soviet rule, to escape to Vilnius (), previously part of Poland which at that point had also fallen under Soviet rule. However, Rabbi Grodzinski knew that the Russians and Lithuanians had made an agreement that they would return Vilnius to Lithuania, which had been their capital city for centuries. Many of the yeshivas, including Mir, Kletsk, Kaminetz, Baranovich, Grodno and Radin, therefore escaped to Vilna. Altogether, there were about 25,000 Jewish refugees in Vilna at the time. The Polish refugees were warmly welcomed by the Jews of Vilna, with many of them hosting refugees in their homes; sometimes the host families were left with just one room for themselves. Some hosts also aided their guests financially. Although the Prime Minister of Lithuania treated the Jews well, his government decided after a few weeks that having the capital city packed with refugees was an unsustainable situation, and so the yeshivas were ordered to scatter throughout the nearby towns. The Kaminetz Yeshiva resettled in Rasein, where shiurim (classes) continued more or less regularly. The Mir Yeshiva relocated to Keidan, the Radin Yeshiva to Eishishok, the Kletsk Yeshiva to Yanov, and the Baranovich Yeshiva to Troki, and later in Smilishoki. The exiled yeshivas were supported by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and the by Rabbis in America.  Attempt to Escape Europe  Mir Yeshiva in Shanghai Zheshart in the Komi Republic, one of the places the Soviets sent yeshiva students to. The refugees in Lithuania knew that staying where they were in Europe was not a permanent setup, as they were situated in between two warring nations, with the Nazis to the west and the Soviets to the east. The Vaad Hayeshivos (\\"The Council of Yeshivas\\", an organization in Eastern Europe led by Rabbi Grodzinski that helped support the region's yeshivas) worked to supply all the yeshiva students with visas and passports that they would need to escape Europe for Japan and Curacao. Japanese consul Chiune Sugihara issued visas to refugees, against his country's orders, from morning until night. For many of the students, the visas were insufficient: they needed to cross Russia to Japan on the Trans- Siberian Railway, and tickets cost $170, money which many of them didn't have. The Nasi (president) of the Mir Yeshiva, Rabbi Avraham Kalmanowitz, went to the United States, understanding that he would be able to help the Jews in Europe much more from there. He was one of the heads of the Vaad Hatzolah in America, and collected money to help his yeshiva. Rabbi Shlomo Wolbe, who was in Sweden at the time, and Mike Tress from the United States, also helped collect the funds. In the end, virtually the entire Mir Yeshiva was able to escape Europe via the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Vladivostok, and from there to Kobe, Japan. The yeshiva, together with many other Jewish refugees who managed to escape to the east, were later transferred to Shanghai, where the Japanese interred them in a ghetto. Rabbi Kalmanowitz continued sending money to them. Fragments of the Polish chassidic Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva also managed to escape to Japan and then China, and studied in the same beth midrash (Torah study hall) as the Mir. The many students who remained in Lithuania continued their escape efforts, attempting to travel to America. Although Vilnius had originally been given by the Soviets to Lithuania, the Soviets soon took over the entire region in 1940. When the Russian government found that the yeshiva students were attempting to leave for America, they began to view the students as anti-Communist and against the Soviet Union. They therefore didn't want them so close to the war front, lest the Germans invaded Russia and the yeshiva students joined sides with them (as the Nazis were intent on wiping out European Jewry, the yeshivas wouldn't have joined them anyway). They therefore made plans to deport the students to Siberia. However, Russian soldiers had been commandeering Jewish homes in Lithuania, and when the hosts got wind of the situation, they warned the yeshiva students of the government's plans. Many of the students therefore went into hiding to avoid the deportation, while many felt it would be safer for them in Siberia than to be so close to the Nazi front. In the end, many of the yeshiva students, including those from the Kaminetz, Radin, and Bialystok yeshivas, were sent to Russia, although not all to Siberia. While some, including students from Novardok and their teacher, Rabbi Yehudah Leib Nekritz, were indeed sent to Siberia, others were taken to the remote Komi Republic at the foot of the Ural Mountains where they were forced to work.  The Holocaust  The Seventh Fort, where thousands of Jews were murdered by Lithuanian Nazi sympathizers Mere days after the yeshiva students' deportation to the Komi Republic, the Nazis invaded Lithuania, bringing the Holocaust along with them. The students who had stayed behind hoping for safety were ultimately killed by the Nazis. The Telshe Yeshiva was located in the city of Telšiai () in Lithuania, and was therefore relatively already safe when World War II broke out. However, they made plans to move the yeshiva to the United States, and Rabbi Elya Meir Bloch and Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz traveled to America to arrange the transfer. The yeshiva, led by Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Bloch, continued in Telshe. While the rosh yeshiva's daughter and son, Rabbi Baruch and Rebbitzen Rochel Sorotzkin, fled to Japan, Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak remained in Lithuania with his students. All of the many yeshiva students as well as the rosh yeshiva were killed by the Nazis soon after. The members of the Kelm Talmud Torah, also already located in Lithuania since before the outbreak of World War II, were also massacred in the Holocaust, along with the rest of the city's Jewish population. Rounded up on July 29, 1941, the Jews were marched to the forest in outskirts of the city to be murdered. The yeshiva's mashgiach ruchani, Rabbi Doniel Movshovitz, was forced to lead the Jews, with his brother-in-law Rabbi Gershon Miadnik, holding a sefer Torah, and the city's rabbi, Rabbi Kalman Reinishovitz, alongside him. They were then forced to dig graves. Before being killed, Rabbi Movshovitz got permission to speak to everyone, and afterwards, they were all shot. In the town of Slabodka, on June 25, 1941, the Kaunas pogrom broke out, during which thousands of Jews were murdered. It was around this time that all of the Slabodka Yeshiva were killed, with 108 students and teachers being killed in a single week. Many were killed in the Seventh and Ninth Forts, where Lithuanian Nazi- collaborators killed thousands of Jews. Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman of Baranovich and Rabbi Avrohom Grodzinski of Slabodka were murdered around that time too, in the Seventh Fort. The members of the Ponovezh Yeshiva were all killed as well, by the Nazis. The rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, was in Palestine at the time.  Outside of Europe  Battle of El Alamein ultimately saved the Jews in Palestine from the Holocaust While the yeshivas affected the most were those in Europe, the yeshivas in Mandatory Palestine and the United States were affected as well. In 1942, Nazi General Erwin Rommel and his army conquered North Africa and planned to advance further into Palestine. All the Jews in the region, which included the students of the Chevron Yeshiva, Yeshivas Eitz Chaim, and Yeshiva Porat Yosef, were terrified of succumbing to the Holocaust. In the end, the British defeated Rommel in the Battle of El Alamein in Egypt. The United States also was affected by the war. In 1940, Zeirei Agudath Israel founded a night yeshiva for young Jewish refugees from Europe. Headed at first by Rabbi Gedalia Schorr and later by Rabbi Shlomo Rottenberg, its teachers included Rabbi Berel Belsky (father of Rabbi Yisroel Belsky), Rabbi Simcha Wasserman, Rabbi Shachne Zohn, and Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Shurkin.  Reestablishment  Mir Yeshiva in Brooklyn Despite being destroyed in the Holocaust, many of the yeshivas were reestablished in the United States and/or Israel during or after World War II. The Mir Yeshiva, likely the only Eastern European yeshiva to continue during the Holocaust, divided after World War II, between a yeshiva in New York, opened and led by Rabbi Avraham Kalmanowitz, and a yeshiva in Jerusalem, opened and led by Rabbi Eliezer Yehudah Finkel, who had already served as rosh yeshiva in Europe. The Telshe Yeshiva was reopened in the United States in Cleveland by Rabbi Eliyahu Meir Bloch and Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz. The Ramailes Yeshiva was reestablished by Rabbi Yisrael Zev Gustman in New York and later in Israel. The Grodno yeshiva was reestablished in Queens and led by Rabbi Zelig Epstein. The Kaminetz Yeshiva as well was reestablished, by Rabbi Moshe Bernstein and Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Leibowitz in Jerusalem; and the Ponovezh Yeshiva was reestablished in Bnei Brak by Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman. The branch of the Lomza Yeshiva that had been opened in Petach Tikvah in 1926 continued functioning after the war.

History According to Binoy Ghosh, it is very difficult to penetrate the hazy clouds of imagination and mythology that surround the king named Chandraketu of Chandrakona. It is popular belief in Chandrakona that Bir Bhan of the Bhan dynasty (Chouhan dynasty) overthrew the last king of the Chandraketu dynasty and became the king of Chandrakona. An English translation of the Persian book Baharistan-i-Ghaibi has recently been published. (Binoy Ghosh visited Chandrakona in 1952.)Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part II, 1976 edition, pages 95-97, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata. Binoy Ghosh writes that in Baharistan-i-Ghaibi it is mentioned that Bir Bhan succeeded Chandra Bhan. This change must have taken place around mid-17th century. It is possible that Chandra Bhan became Chandra Ketu as information spread amongst the people. The stone tablet in the Lalji temple mentions that the nava-ratna temple was established by the wife of Harinarayan, daughter-in-law of Bir Bhan, Mitrasen’s mother, daughter of Holray, and sister of the Malla king (of Bishnupur) Srinarayan. The construction work started in 1571 Sakabda (1649 AD) and was completed in 1577 Shakabda (1655 AD). It was the golden age of Chandrakona when the Bhan dyanasty ruled in the 17th century. Chandrakona became famous for its ‘fiftytwo markets and fiftythree lanes’. The number of temples that are still there in Chandrakona is a matter of wonder. Geography The Parvatinatha temple is located at . The temple David J. McCutchion says that the roof of a ratna temple “is surmounted by one or more towers or pinnacles called ratna (jewel). The simplest form has a single central tower (eka-ratna), to which may be added four more at the corners (pancha-ratna)”. The number of towers or pinnacles can be increased up to a maximum of twentyfive. The ratna style came up in the 15th-16th century. McCutchion classifies the Parvatinatha temple as a standard saptadasa-ratna. Built in the 19th century, it has rich terracotta and stucco decoration and measures 21’ 6” square.McCutchion, David J., Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal, first published 1972, reprinted 2017, pages 8-10, 55. The Asiatic Society, Kolkata, Chandrakona town showcases a large 17-pinnacled Parvatinatha temple, built in 1871 and “reconstructed with no thought to its heritage value.

In 1998, the reconstructed facility opened as the First USA Riverfront Arts Center, a 120,000-square-foot hall holding museum-quality exhibits. The center was made for traveling special exhibitions, with the designers specifically copying the role of the Florida International Museum. The facility featured 25,000 square feet of galleries, a 6,000-square-foot gift shop and a 13,000-square-foot lobby, with design touches such as a terrazo floor with a compass rose design. The cost was $10 million and included $2.5 million in funding from First USA Bank, which purchased the naming rights. It was built to complement the Shipyard Shops outlet mall, built at the same time, but which went defunct in 2009. In 2002, the facility was occupied by the Delaware Art Museum as temporary exhibition space until their facility reconstruction opened in 2005. In January 2003, concurrent with the deprecation of the First USA brand by Bank One, the building was renamed to the Bank One Center on the Riverfront. After the Delaware Art Museum moved out, renovation began to transition the facility into a convention center and banquet hall, and the center was rededicated in 2005.

It was first published in the United States on July 7, 2020 through Simon & Schuster and centers upon a family living in Atlantic City during the 1930s. Synopsis Esther and Joseph Adler own a bakery, above which is an apartment they lived in while they raised their two daughters. While they now have a house, they still return to the apartment each summer so they can make extra money by renting out their home to vacationers eager to visit Atlantic City. The apartment grows cramped after their daughters, college girl Florence and expectant mother Fannie, return home. Florence is preparing to swim the English Channel, a dangerous venture that requires that she spend the summer training, and Fannie must remain on bed rest lest she run the risk of miscarriage. Joseph has also brought home a young Jewish woman that he helped emigrate from Nazi Germany, which makes the apartment even more crowded. After Florence dies during a swimming accident Esther convinces the family to hide the truth from Fannie out of fear that that she would lose the baby. This proves to be a difficult venture and one that brings out much family tension and many secrets. Development Beanland began writing the novel during a novel writing workshop at Virginia Commonwealth University during 2016; she would later use the first six chapters of the novel for her Master of Fine Arts thesis. The book's central premise, that a mother would hide the death of a child from their sibling, was derived from the story of her great-aunt Florence Lowenthal's death. Florence died from drowning and while the youngest sibling (Beanland's grandmother) had known about the death as soon as it happened, the eldest sibling was not told because she was in the hospital. Beanland stated that her mother emphasized \\"what a strong woman Florence’s mother must have been\\" and as such, that she had been doing the right thing. Beachland, who was a teenager at the time, wondered “What if Florence’s sister — my great-grandmother — had wanted to know her sister had died.” She was initially nervous to have her mother and grandmother read the story; her grandmother died before the novel was completed but had stated that she was fine with the novel's premise. Beanland's mother read one of the novel's drafts and while she initially had some trouble separating some of the characters from their real life counterparts, \\"two-thirds of the way through she was able to let go of the real people and embrace the characters. When she finished the book she called me in tears and said it was lovely.\\" The professor teaching the workshop, Tom De Haven, introduced Beanland to an agent with Janklow & Nesbit Associates. After several drafts were completed, the agent shopped the final draft to several publishing houses. They eventually chose to sell the book to Simon & Schuster in January 2019. Publication Florence Adler Swims Forever was first published in hardback and ebook format on July 7, 2020 through Simon & Schuster. An audiobook adaptation was released through Simon & Schuster Audio and is narrated by the ensemble cast of Jonathan Davis, Tim Paige, Carly Robins, Jonathan Todd Ross, Tara Sands, Jesse Vilinsky, Gabra Zackman, and the author, Rachel Beanland. Reception Critical reception was largely positive and common elements of praise centered around the book's handling of tragedy and family drama. A reviewer for the Jewish Book Council praised the accuracy of Beanland's depiction of a Jewish person trying to flee pre-war Germany and for being one of \\"not many stories depicting Jewish immigrants already living for a generation in America in 1934\\". The New York Times's Allegra Goodman noted that while the book had some limitations, \\"Beanland’s novel draws the reader in. The situation she describes is poignant and the characters she develops win us over with their private grief.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2020 American novels Category:2020 debut novels Category:Nazis in fiction Category:Immigration in fiction Category:Simon & Schuster books Category:Atlantic City, New Jersey in fiction Category:Novels set in New Jersey Category:Novels set in the 1930s Category:Fiction set in 1934 Category:Jewish American novels ","title":"Florence Adler Swims Forever"},{"id":"65018076","text":"Baldomero Argente del Castillo (1877–1965) was a Spanish politician, sociologist, lawyer, economist, writer and journalist.

History=Forerunner The Königsberg theatre began with carnival games and school comedies at the beginning of the 16th century. In 1552, Conquest of Rome by Georg Sabinus was performed in the courtyard, and in 1573 The Fall of Man by the schoolmaster Roll. In 1605, Marie Eleonore of Cleves had English comedians perform for her in Königsberg Castle. In 1618, they played Shakespeare. The first opera, Cleomedes by Heinrich Albert, was performed by students in 1635 before Władysław IV Vasa. In 1688 Christopher Marlowe's The Tragic History of Doctor Faustus was performed. Arranged by director Hilferding, the Schönemann company played Dr. Faustus, Molière's Tartuffe and Gottsched's The Dying Cato.Herbert Meinhard Mühlpfordt: Königsberg von A bis Z. Ein Stadtlexikon. München 1972, . In 1753 Frederick the Great donated Kreytzenschen Square to the theatre director Konrad Ernst Ackermann to build a permanent theatre. With the money of businessman Friedrich Saturgus, Ackermann built the 300-seat theatre as the first in the Kingdom of Prussia. It was opened in 1755 with Racine's \\"Mithridate\\". Lessing's Miss Sara Sampson followed. Fearing the Seven Years' War, Ackermann left Königsberg in 1756 and went to Leipzig. In 1768 Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder wrote the first theatre reviews in Johann Jakob Kanter's Königsberg Scholars and Political Newspapers. In 1769 director Karl Theophil Döbbelin performed Minna von Barnhelm. Caroline Schuch used the Singspiel between 1771 and 1787. In 1785 there were the first performances of The Robbers, The Fiesco Conspiracy in Genoa, Don Carlos and Clavigo. In 1788 the Schuch siblings brought The Abduction from the Seraglio, in 1793 Don Giovanni and in 1794 The Magic Flute. In 1795 the theatre burned down. Plays continued in the old town of Junkerhof. The first performance of The Marriage of Figaro took place there in 1798. In 1800 a new theatre was built on the old site based on a design by Friedrich Gilly. After another fire, it was rebuilt in 1802. Director Steinberg brought Zacharias Werner's Consecration of Power, Wallenstein and Mary Stuart in 1803, Nathan the Wise in 1804 and The Bride of Messina in 1807. At the beginning of the Coalition Wars, songs by Max von Schenkendorf were performed. In 1809 Racine's tragedy Phèdre was staged. After that the theatre became a concert and society centre.  Municipal theatre New foyer The foundation stone for the municipal theatre was laid in 1806 by the Minister for East Prussia of the German Empire Friedrich von Schrötter on Paradeplatz (Königsberg)). The building, designed by , stood partly on the foundations of the that was still under construction. On 9 March 1808, director Carl Steinberg opened it in the presence of the court with the opera La clemenza di Tito. For unexplained reasons, the building burned down on 1 July 1808. The reopening took place in the presence of the royal couple in December 1809 with the festival The Consecration. The theatre premiered William Tell (Schiller) in 1810, and The Maid of Orleans in 1811. August von Kotzebue was the artistic director. In 1815, Iphigenia in Tauris and Götz von Berlichingen were performed. In 1819, director Hurray brought the first performances of Fidelio and Der Freischütz. After the collapse of the theatre in 1828 and the dissolution of the ensemble, The Broken Jug premiered in 1830 and Faust in 1832. The world premiere of The Last Held of Marienburg by Joseph von Eichendorff in 1831 was unsuccessful. The composer Richard Wagner was Kapellmeister at the city theatre from 1836 to 1837. In 1836 he married the actress Minna Planer, who was engaged there, in the Tragheim Church. In 1854 the theatre received gas lighting. For years, German Student Corps from and Corps Masovia acted as doormen. They had to make sure that only students who had been designated by the were allowed to enter the ground floor for 6 Silbergroschen. In return, they were allowed to watch the performance free of charge.John Koch: Die Geschichte des Corps Baltia. Königsberg 1906, S. 48. In 1879, under the direction of and conducted by Emil Paur, the German premiere of Bizet's Carmen began, with which it began its global triumph. After the theatre collapsed again after 1890, the foyer was rebuilt and restaurants were added in 1893. In 1903 the theatre was fitted out with electrical lighting. At the beginning of the First World War, the theatre was rededicated as a hospital. Reopened on 27 August 1918 as a pure opera house, in 1924 it was merged with the New Playhouse to form the East Prussian State Theatre. The first performance of Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss took place in 1927. In 1928 the city acquired both theatres. The history of the theatre ended in World War II when it burned to the ground during the air raids on Königsberg at the end of August 1944.

Since 2007, she has been listed as one of the richest women in Indonesia. Early life and education Kartini was born Pauline Fanny Kho on 17 May 1930 in Kebumen, Central Java, the Dutch East Indies. Her parents were Budi Tjahono and Marianne Han. Her mother, who was of partial Dutch ancestry, was a teacher at a local school. Her father worked as an accountant for the colony’s electricity company, Algemene Nederlandsch Indische Electriciteit Maatschappij. When Kartini was about two-and-a-half years old, her mother died. Her father then married a woman of Chinese descent, who worked as a trader and taught Kartini to work industriously, especially during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies when there was no school. Her father encouraged her to save money. After Indonesia’s 1945 declaration of independence, when ethnic Chinese citizens were encouraged to adopt Indonesian names, her father changed his name from Kho (Xu in Chinese) to Budi Tjahjono, while Pauline Fanny Kho became Kartini, choosing the name of pioneering Indonesian feminist Kartini. Kartini and her brother were among a few non-Dutch children permitted to attend a European school, where they studied Indonesian, Dutch, English, German and French, before opting for elective mathematics. Kartini also studied in Surabaya and Yogyakarta, before moving to Jakarta, where she majored in Law and Social Sciences at the University of Indonesia. During her studies, she worked at Candra Naya Social Organization (established 1946 as Sin Ming Hui), which provided health and legal services for the poor. She received her law degree in 1958. Judicial career In 1958, Kartini was appointed a judge at Jakarta Special Court, where she was assigned to handle criminal, civil and bankruptcy cases. At that time, Dutch judges had been replaced by Indonesian judges. She served on the court until 1970 and had a reputation for not being corrupt. During her time as a judge, she undertook notary studies at the University of Indonesia, completing her course in 1967. Following the death on 21 February 1973 of her husband, Djojo Muljadi, who was a notary, Kartini resigned as a civil servant because her income was insufficient to cover her family’s needs. She was appointed a notary domiciled in Jakarta. Her clients included state-owned companies such as Widya Karya and multinationals such as Unilever. She also began to lecture in civil procedural law at various law faculties in Jakarta. She became a prominent notary, working for major companies in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1990, she retired as a notary and established her own law office and legal consultancy, named Muljadi & Rekan. Her clients included large national and multinational companies. When the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis struck, she provided legal guidance to the banking sector. She was part of a team that provided legal advice to the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA). She also provided legal opinions and recommendations to government agencies and shareholders of insolvent banks. She has also advised the World Bank. Kartini was involved in drafting laws, such as the Limited Liability Company Law and the Bankruptcy Law. Cosmetics and pharmaceuticals business During her studies in Jakarta, Kartini worked at a beauty salon owned by a Dutch woman married to an Indonesian doctor. The Dutch woman taught her how to make cosmetics. When the woman went back to the Netherlands, Kartini took over the business, paying for it in installments and bought its trademark. This business became Tempo Scan, which was established in 1953. Later renamed Tempo Scan Pacific, it became one of Indonesia’s leading pharmaceutical firms. The group's branded pharmaceutical products include Bodrex and Hemaviton. Cosmetics include Marina brand body lotion and the My Baby range of oils, powders and wipes. In 2007, Kartini was ranked 28th on Forbes' list of richest Indonesians, with wealth of $260 million. In 2008, she was ranked 32nd, with a fortune of $130 million. In 2019, Kartini was listed 48th on Forbes' list of 50 richest Indonesians, with a fortune of $630 million. She was the highest-ranked woman on the list. Sumber Waras case In November 1970, Candra Naya Social Organization (PSCN) head Padmo Sumasto granted a 32,372-square-meter plot of land in Grogol, West Jakarta, to Sumber Waras Foundation. He canceled the decision in September 1999, taking back the land for PSCN. Later, when Kartini became head of Sumber Waras Foundation, she filed a police report against new PSCN head, I Wayan Suparmin, alleging he had embezzled a certificate for the land. Sumber Waras Foundation held a certificate for 3.7 hectares of land adjacent to the disputed plot. In 2014, it sold the 3.7 hectare plot to Jakarta administration for Rp775.69 billion ($55.9 million). The city administration planned to build a cancer hospital on the site, but could not access the site from a main road unless it also purchased the disputed land held by PSCN. In the sale and purchase agreement, Sumber Waras said the city administration could use the entrance gate on the disputed land. On 23 September 2015, West Jakarta District Court ruled the disputed land to be held by Sumber Waras Foundation and sentenced Wayan to 18 months in jail. On 16 November 2015, Jakarta High Court overturned the decision, returned the certificate to Wayan and cleared him of embezzlement. Separately, the State Audit Agency (BPK) claimed the 3.7 hectares had been sold at an allegedly inflated price, causing the city to suffer losses of Rp191 billion. The BPK report was submitted to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). In April 2016, KPK questioned Kartini over the case. She reportedly said that she received only Rp335 billion of the total land purchase price of Rp775.69 billion. KPK later said it found no evidence of wrongdoing in the sale. In January 2017, West Jakarta District Court ruled Sumber Waras Foundation had legally sold the land without needing to involve PSCN. Family Kartini was married to Djojo Muljadi (Liem Tjing Hien, 1915-1973), who was a notary and had served as secretary of Sing Ming Hui in 1950 and as its president from 1953-55. They had four children: Sutjipto Husodo Muljadi, Dian Mulyani Muljadi, Gunawan S. Muljadi and Handojo Selamet Muljadi. Oldest son Sutjipto owns oil services company PT Mulia Graha Abadi. Daughter Dian is a magazine editor and socialite, and runs an online media portal called Fimela. Third child, Gunawan, runs Kartini's law firm. Youngest son, Handojo, leads Tempo Scan Pacific. Kartini is the grandmother of socialite Richard Muljadi, who gained notoriety for showing off his lavish spending habits on social media, including buying a Mitsubishi Outlander car for one of his pet dogs. Richard was in August 2018 arrested for snorting cocaine in the toilet of a restaurant at South Jakarta's Pacific Place mall. He was sentenced in February 2019 to 18 months of rehabilitation. Awards In 2004, President Megawati Sukarnoputri presented the Capital Market Lifetime Achievement Award to Kartini in recognition of her law firm's development of the Master Settlement and Master Refinancing Agreement that was used to rescue banks that had foundered during the 1997-98 economic crisis.

It concerns a plan by two wives to test their husbands' fidelity. At a masked ball at the Paris Opéra, each wife disguises herself in a pink domino – a hooded cloak with a mask – to woo the other's husband. The play was first produced at the Théâtre du Vaudeville, Paris on 17 April 1876 and ran for 127 performances. It was adapted for the West End and Broadway stages as The Pink Dominos, and later became the basis of a Viennese operetta (Der Opernball, 1898) and a musical comedy (To-Night's the Night, 1914). Background and first production In 1876 the Théâtre du Vaudeville emerged from a succession of short and unprofitable runs with the production of Le Procès Veauradieux by Alfred Delacour and Alfred Hennequin, which ran for 175 performances, at a time when a run of 100 performances was regarded as a success for a Parisian theatre.Noël and Stoullig (1876), p. 250 and (1877), p. 467\\"Edmond Audran\\" , Opérette – Théâtre Musical, Académie Nationale de l'Opérette.

The former is a mildly cynical Parisienne, and the latter a more innocent country girl. Angèle is indignant when her friend suggests that all husbands are untrustworthy, and she agrees to Marguerite's suggestion of putting the matter to a practical test. Each will attempt to woo the other's husband at a masked ball at the Opéra. With the aid of Hortense, Marguerite's maid, they concoct notes from supposed anonymous admirers to Georges and Paul, their spouses, inviting them to a rendezvous that evening. Both husbands fall for the ploy and invent plausible excuses for absenting themselves from home that night. Each meets his friend's wife, who is disguised under the folds of a \\"pink domino\\". (The Oxford English Dictionary defines a domino as \\"A kind of loose cloak, apparently of Venetian origin, chiefly worn at masquerades, with a small mask covering the upper part of the face\\"). Paul with Marguerite on his arm, and Georges conducting Angèle, both adjourn after midnight to private dining rooms in a fashionable restaurant. The potential for confusion is enhanced by the presence in another private room of Hortense, the maid, also wearing a pink domino. She is escorted by Henri, a young lawyer, the nephew of Marguerite's formidable aunt, Madame Beaubuisson. When the three couples have supped, and the champagne has flowed freely, a series of \\"quiproquos\\" – mistaken identities – follows, in which there is a continual, rapid interchange of partners. Hortense flirts with each of the men in turn, and eventually all three couples leave. Next morning Paul finds that Georges's wife had been at the ball, wearing a domino rose; Georges learns the same as regards Angèle. There is no doubt in the mind of either that he has terribly injured his friend, and both are conscience-stricken. A bracelet has been found in the restaurant, which fell from the arm of the mysterious \\"pink domino\\", and, in the midst of noisy and fruitless explanations between the whole party, it is brought in. This relieves Paul and Georges from their self recriminations, but it leads to a discovery that almost equally confounds them, for it turns out to belong to Madame Beaubuisson, a grande dame who for thirty years has been seen as a model of rectitude. In the end this mystery, as well as all the other incidents of the evening, is explained when it becomes known that the young lawyer had borrowed some of his aunt's jewellery with which to adorn Hortense. The latter's domino is produced; Paul sees in it a hole that had been burned by his cigar; Georges sees a corner that he had accidentally torn, and both are consequently enlightened as to whose conquest they have effected. Each keeps his knowledge to himself. Marguerite is pleased at the success of her plan and Angèle has had her lesson in Parisian philosophy; Marguerite has no great confidence that the men's reformation will last, but both wives are satisfied to forgive the antics of their penitent husbands. :Source: The Era.\\"The Drama in Paris\\", The Era, 23 April 1876, p. 4 Reception In the Journal amusant Pierre Véron wrote, \\"I will not tell you that the laughter completely escapes vulgarity, but the important thing is to have fun, and frankly we were very amused with the frenetic comings and goings.

Life  Pantjiti Mary McLean was born circa 1930 in Kaltukatjara, Docker River, Western Australia. She met her husband Mr. Bates at Blackstone. In the 1950s she left the Western Desert walking with her husband and son to the Warburton Ranges, and then to Cosmo Newbury in the Eastern Goldfields. According to government policy of that time local Aboriginal children were to be raised and schooled by the missionaries at Mount Margaret Mission where McLean’s son went too. When McLean’s daughter was born, she was also taken away from her. While children were at the mission McLean was directed to work on the district sheep station where she chose to be a station hand mustering the sheep. In the 1970s McLean moved to the Kalgoorlie Native Reserve, and then in the 1980s to the Ninga Mia Community in the Kalgoorlie, where she lived until 2008. Then she moved to Kunkurangkalpa Aged Care.  Art  During the 1980s McLean produced craftworks and traditional paintings. In 1992 she participated in the Warta Kutju (Wama Wanti) Street Art Project where she met fibre artist Nalda Searles. Starting from 1992 McLean’s paintings have been exhibited widely. In 1993, she created her famous painting Hunting grounds depicting the ripe quandong fruit (walku), the ripples on the surface of the waterholes, the scampering of the goanna (nyintaka) and the laughter and song of her people. The same year a sell-out exhibition of her work in Fremantle launched her career. Throughout the 1990s she worked with artist Nalda Searles as part of the Healthway Fringe Camp Project and developed her distinctive painterly style. In 1995, McLean received a prestigious Telstra Indigenous Award. In 2001, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the Curtin University of Technology in Perth. In 2005 a book with a catalogue for a retrospective exhibition Pantjiti Mary McLean: A Big Story: Paintings and Drawings 1992–2005 was published in Adelaide.

Southern Peninsula) is just a part of and an administrative unit on Reykjanes Peninsula. Origin The two most important factors for the existence of Iceland, rifting in combination with a hot spot, an upwelling of unusual quantities of magma from the mantle, were also responsible for the existence of Reykjanesskagi.Thor Thordarson, Armann Hoskuldsson: Iceland. Classic geology of Europe 3. Harpenden 2002, p. 8-10 Reykjanes Peninsula has its origin in a so called rift jump 6-7 million years ago. At this time, the active Snæfellsnes-Skagi rift had drifted so far to the west and away from the presumed steady place hot spot, that activity shifted eastwards in direction of this mantle plume which is now thought to be situated under the big glacier shield of Vatnajökull. Outcropping rocks have ages from 3.2 mill. years (Esja) to the present.Thor Thordarson, Armann Hoskuldsson: Iceland. Classic geology of Europe 3. Harpenden 2002, p. 48 Volcanism and glaciations The topography of Reykjanes Peninsula is moted by volcanism, basaltic lava fields covering a good part of the peninsula, in between volcanoes of subglacial as well as subaerial origin, namely tuyas, hyaloclastic ridges (tindars), shield volcanoes and crater rows. Some volcanic systems are even (partially) submarine, so that there is a pronounced continuation between the volcanism of Reykjanes Ridge and the one on Reykjanes Peninsula. Shield volcanoes and glaciovolcanoes of Reykjanes PeninsulaTertiary lavas, sediments and volcanoes around Reykjavík= Famous in the area of Reykjavík is the so called Grágrýti (= Gray Lava). These tertiary basalt lava layers cover for a good part the ground around and under the Capital City. But up to now, their exact origin is unknown.Freyr Pálsson: Jarðfræði Reykjavíkursvæðisins. Háskóla Íslands, Raunvísindadeild, Jarð- og landfræðiskor. (2007) Also it is thought, that the small hills within the City like Öskuhlíð, some of which were islands after the cold spells of glaciation, could be small shield volcanoes from warm spells of the glaciations.Snæbjörn Guðmundsson: Vegavísir um jarðfræði Íslands. Reykjavík 2015, p. 28-30 Known is on the other hand, that during the Plio-Pleistocene (from 3.2 – 1.8 mill. years BP) two central volcanoes were active in the region of today’s Reykjavík, Viðeyvolcano and Stardalsvolcano, both of them partially formed Esja and the smaller mountains near Reykjavík like Úlfarsfell and the hills on the islands and small peninsulas like Viðey and Kjarlarnes. Volcanic and glacial sediments crop out at some places around Reykjavík, esp. in Fossvogur.Snæbjörn Guðmundsson: Vegavísir um jarðfræði Íslands. Reykjavík 2015, p. 31-33 =Volcanoes of subglacial origin= As Iceland was heavily ice covered during the glaciations, and even completely ice covered during parts of them, there are hundreds of subglacially formed volcanoes to be found. On Reykjanes Peninsula glaciers stayed till around 15.000 -12.000 years ago. Most subglacial edifices are thought to be Weichselian and just some of them older. The subglacial volcanoes can be identified according to type as tuyas (bigger edifices whose upper parts are covered by the products of subaerial eruptions), hyaloclastite ridges (also called tindars) which means elongated subvolcanic volcanic buildings of different sizes (most of them) and cone-like subglacial mounds (very rare). On the other hand, there are many hyaloclastite ridges, actually most of them consisting of mixtures of pillow lavas, hyaloclastite and lapilli tuff. Edwards, B.R., Gudmundsson, M.T., Russell, J.K., 2015. Glaciovolcanism. In: Sigurdsson, H., Houghton, B., Rymer, H., Stix, J., McNutt, S. (Eds.), The Encyclopedia of Volcanoes, pp. 377–393. There are also elongated pillow structures, called pillow tindars by Pedersen. Examples on Reykjanes peninsula are Sveifluháls, Núpshlíðarháls, Undirhlíðar, Helgafell (Hafnarfjörður) and Vífilsfell. The tuyas are often sorted acc. to their form (morphology) into flat-topped tuyas, elongated tuyas, conical tuyas and complex tuyas. (See M.T.Russell, cited in ) Many different types are to be found on Reykjanes Peninsula, also mixed types or intergrown hyaloclastite ridges (tindars) and tuyas exist. The prominent igneous rock is basalt, though there are also some basaltic andesite or andesite volcanoes on Reykjanes, like the tindars Húsmúli and Stapafell within the Hengill Volcanic System. Examples for tuyas on Reykjanes Peninsula are Keilir (conical tuya), Geitafell (Brennisteinsfjöll), Geitahlíð and Þorbjörn are flat-topped tuyas whereas Þorðarfell and Syllingarfell (Reykjanes Volcanic System) are complex tuyas. =Postglacial shield volcanoes= \\"The Holocene shield volcanoes even represent the great bulk of magma production in this part of Iceland and the base of many other volcanic landforms. At the end of the glacioisostatic period\\" - ie. after glaciation, when the weight of the glaciers wasn't pushing down the flexible crust of the earth any more and there was an uplift - \\"olivine tholeiites were erupted which have been proposed to constitute ¾60% by volume of all post-glacial lava products on the Reykjanes Peninsula.”M.A.M. Gee et al.: Glacioisostacy controls chemical and isotopic characteristics of tholeiites from the Reykjanes Peninsula, SW Iceland. / Earth and Planetary Science Letters 164 (1998) 1–5 The postglacial shield volcanoes today are situated at the periphery of fissure systems. They erupted after the Weichselian glaciation (i.e. after 15.000 – 12.000) years ago. \\"These shields are mostly circular in form, built up from pahoehoe lavas and “composed of a low-sloping lava cone surrounded by an lava apron”; the older shields are made from picrite, the younger, bigger ones from olivine-tholeiite. They probably were formed in long-lived eruptions (years to decennies).

Earthquakes are often registered. They may reach up to M6, but most of the earthquakes are small ones. See eg.: Reykjanes Peninsula. Icelandic Met OfficeThese earthquakes often take place within the volcanic systems, but there are also many faults, fractures and fissures in N-S direction on the peninsula. Additionally, the region is influenced by the South Iceland Seismic Zone. This southern transform zone of Iceland is located between the West Volcanic Zone and the East Volcanic Zone. The bigger earthquakes there not only are felt and registered on Reykjanes Peninsula, but they can also trigger medium sized quakes in this region, as last seen in 2008 and especially in 2000.

The structure was located on Kottbusser Ufer 48–50, today's Fraenkelufer 10-16. On Kristallnacht, the evening of November 9-10th, 1938, the main building of the synagogue was badly damaged. Further destruction in the following years led to the structures ultimate demolition in 1958/1959 after the end of World War II. Today the surviving outbuilding, previously used for the youth service, has been renovated and is home to a Conservative Synagogue. A complete reconstruction of the main synagogue that was destroyed by the National Socialists is being planned for its original location. History=1913–1933: Construction and Life in the Weimar Republic The Jewish master builder Alexander Beer designed the neoclassical synagogue in 1912 after the Jewish community acquired the site in 1911. Construction work began a year later and the inauguration took place on September 17, 1916. With over 2,000 seats, this synagogue was one of the largest in Berlin. In addition to the main prayer hall, the building complex also had a weekday synagogue, a hall for youth services, a wedding hall, and meeting and living rooms. In 1925 the Jewish community opened a kindergarten and after-school care center and in the following years a youth home and a holiday playground on the site. Twice a week there was also an afternoon religious school. The rabbi of the synagogue from its inauguration until 1932 was Isidor Bleichrode. He was later replaced by Rabbi Julius Jakobovits. The composer and collector of synagogue music Arno Nadel officiated as cantor and choir director. 1933–1942: The Synagogue during National Socialism The systematic social, economic exclusion and expropriation of the Jews by the National Socialists resulted in poverty and material hardship. The Jewish community tried to provide help through welfare offices and a Jewish Winter Aid (Jüdische Winterhilfe) distribution point, which were located in the building complex. In 1935 a relief kitchen was set up in the basement of the synagogue. As early as 1930 the synagogue was defaced with swastikas and other anti-Semitic slogans. Like many other buildings belonging to the Jewish community, this synagogue was set on fire during the November pogroms, Kristallnacht, in 1938. Since the synagogue was adjacent to a city school, the fire brigade and police kept the spread of the flames in check. The synagogue was badly damaged, but not destroyed, however the main prayer hall could no longer be used for services. From December 1938 until October 1942, the congregation therefore met in the youth synagogue in the side wing of the building instead. Since only seven Berlin synagogues were reopened after the November pogroms, other congregations in the neighborhood also held their services in the building. Youth Synagogue on Fraenkelufer Memorial Marker at Fraenkelufer 10 Inauguration of the Synagogue, 1959 After Rabbi Julius Jakobovits emigrated to Great Britain, where his son Immanuel Jakobovits later became Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Georg Kantorowski, Rabbi Regina Jonas and Rabbi Martin Riesenburger occasionally officiated in the synagogue. At the end of 1941 the building was used to store looted Jewish property from around Berlin. At the beginning of 1942 the Gestapo occupied the entire property and used it to park military vehicles. In a bombing raid on Berlin in 1944 the site suffered further destruction and in 1958/1959 the main building was fully demolished. Reopening in 1945 Immediately after the war, the youth services building was the first synagogue in Berlin to be reopened in time for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year celebrations, in September 1945. This is primarily thanks to the initiative of the Jewish American soldier Harry Nowalsky. The Jewish Hungarian-American war photographer Robert Capa immortalized this special moment in a series of pictures for ’’Life’’ magazine. Some of these images have been displayed in the synagogue since 2016. In the years following its reopening in 1945, weddings, bar mitzvahs and religious instruction took place in the synagogue. In 1985, around 25 Torah curtains from various synagogues were found hidden in the attic and were restored. Some of them can be viewed today in the synagogue on Fraenkelufer. A memorial stone by Cornelia Lengfeld erected on the property boundary in 1989 reminds visitors of the destruction in the past. The building is a historical monument, and a memorial plaque on the embankment shows the earlier construction and tells the story of the site's destruction. The community since its rededication in 1959 On April 22, 1959, the former side wing of the synagogue was consecrated again, after significant reconstruction and has since been used for prayers and community life. There, rabbis of different affiliations take turns, from liberal to orthodox. In the beginning, the community of prayer consisted of survivors and returnees. Many of them lived and worked in the immediate vicinity of the synagogue. Over the years, immigrants from different countries also joined, and in the 1980s and 1990s, many immigrants came from the former Soviet Union. From the mid-2000s, the congregants became even more diverse and international: Many young Israelis, North and South Americans, people from different European countries and beyond have made Kreuzberg and Neukölln - and with it the Fraenkelufer Synagogue - their new home. The Board of Trustees for the Reconstruction of the Fraenkelufer Synagogue, 2019 In 2012 the Friends of the Fraenkelufer Synagogue (Freunde der Synagoge Fraenkelufer e. V.) was founded by supporters and members in order to actively shape community life and to organize cultural and educational events. The community has grown so much that the reconstruction of the original synagogue building as a Jewish community and cultural center is now being planned. Planned Reconstruction The synagogue is to be completely rebuilt in its original location in Kreuzberg. The project represents the first time that a fully complete reconstruction of a synagogue that was destroyed during the Nazi period in Berlin will come to fruition. Other projects in the city to date are partial or considered renovations. On the initiative of the SPD Politician Raed Saleh, the Förderverein Jüdisches Zentrum Synagoge Fraenkelufer e.V. set up a board of trustees that will deal intensively with the reconstruction. The 20-person committee attaches great importance to the fact that the new synagogue is based on the architectural style of the previous building. The committee includes Raed Saleh, Monika Herrmann, Michael Müller, as well as representatives of the Jewish and Muslim communities and people from business and the media. In order to actually make progress, donations must first be raised and the population's understanding of this reconstruction must be deepened, especially in times of increasing anti- Semitism. The laying of the foundation stone is planned for 2023, 85 years after the destruction in the night of the pogrom. Completion is planned for the 110th anniversary of the synagogue in 2026. Architecture The synagogue consisted of a main building with several auxiliary buildings on a triangular site, in which a weekday synagogue, official apartments and a building for the youth service were housed. Accordingly, it was not only intended to serve as a place of worship, but also as a community center and was used in this way in the early years. The synagogue building consisted of a three-aisled structure that offered space for 2,000 people. It was built as a pillar basilica, with the facade facing the Landwehr Canal structured with windows in the upper storey. As an architectural style, Beer chose a neoclassical style with elements from medieval and baroque buildings; a large portico with four Greek columns represented the dominant three-part entrance area. The smaller synagogue for youth services was structured by Doric half-columns. By the end of the 1970s, its facade was painted green and white. It is roughly half as high as the former main sanctuary building.

The game was released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in July 28, 2020. The game later released for the Nintendo Switch on September 10 that same year. It had received generally positive reviews upon release. Gameplay Othercide is a tactical role-playing video game that the player controls a group of Daughters, who are female warriors who fight against the nightmarish Suffering in a dimension known as the Dark Corner. While the Daughters and the enemies take turn to take actions, the game features a dynamic timeline system, allowing players to use various skills to delay an opponent's turn or speed up another Daughter's turn. All actions require action points, and if the players spend too many action points, the Daughter will become exhausted and she will need to wait longer before she can act again. The game features three classes: Blademaster, who wields a melee weapon, the Shieldbearer which has a lot of health, and the Soulslinger who serves mainly as a ranged support character. Each character has unique skills and can be combined together to start a chain reaction. The skills of these classes can also be extensively customised. The player's playstyle will also shape their traits and personalities. The game also features roguelike elements. Battles take place in small maps, and when the player's squad is defeated, they would not lose their progress and new items named \\"Remembrances\\" are unlocked. These items improve combat efficiency and allow players to survive longer. The only way to heal a fallen daughter is to sacrifice another Daughter in exchange. The surviving Daughter will have altered traits, enabling further customisations. Development The development of the game began in 2017. French studio Lightbulb Crews served as the game's developer. The main goal for art director Alex Chaudret was to make the game artistically distinct from other strategy games in the market. The game's artistic direction was inspired by BLAME , Berserk and Claymore. Initially, the game was set in a city inspired by Paris (where Lightbulb Crews is based in), the team ultimately decided that they did not want to create a setting that was grounded in reality, and therefore, opted to set the game in an otherworldly dimension named The Dark Corner. According to Chaudret, the Dark Corner was \\"shaped by broken psyches and trauma\\". The game mainly features black and white as its color scheme, with splashes of red to \\"flesh out the important elements of both the lore and the gameplay\\". Publisher Focus Home Interactive announced the game on February 21, 2020. It was released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on July 28, 2020. A Nintendo Switch version released on September 10, 2020. Reception The PC and PS4 versions of the game received generally positive reviews upon release according to review aggregator Metacritic, while the Xbox One version received mixed reviews. T.J Hafer from IGN awarded the game a 9/10, praising its combat and difficulty. He concluded his review by saying that \\"Othercide is a tactical roguelike with a flair for the dramatic, full of satisfying combat, careful planning, and sometimes heart-rending decisions\\". Tom Hatfield from PC Gamer also enjoyed the combat and described the combat system as \\"a pleasing puzzle\\". He also praised the \\"striking\\" art style, which helps create the game's \\"doom and gloom atmosphere\\". Due to the game's inclusion of roguelike elements, Hatfield believed that the game may not be suitable for players who are impatient.

He served as director of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1818 to 1821. Life=Early life and education Dajon was born on 21 January 1748 in Copenhagen, the son of building administrator Frantz Dajon (1719–94) and Agnete Plum (1718–87). His family was of French origin but had been present in Denmark from at least 1624 and had for several generations counted members in royal service. He trained as a sculptor under Jacques Saly at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1759 and won its large gold medal for the relief Israeliterne samle Manna i Ørken in 1766. Career Jens Juel: Portrait of the sculptor Nicolai Dajon, 1780s Dajon began his career as an employee in Johannes Wiedewelt's studio. Although he received promise of a travel stipend in conjunction with the gold medal, the actual funds would not be made available until 1776. He made his way over Germany to Italy. In 1778, he sent a now lost statue of Paris in half natural size back to Denmark. He returned to Denmark in 1781 and was in 1783 admitted as member of the Academy. His admission piece was an allegorical representation of the Baltic Sea in the form of a reclined figure. It was difficult times for a young sculptor since the few major commissions all went to Wiedewelt, and Dajon, therefore, had to survive on a small income by teaching moulding at the Academy's decoration school. In 1803, after Wiedewelt's death, he was finally appointed as professor at the Academy. The position came with a studio in Civiletatens Materialgård at Frederiksholms Kanal.. Dajon served as director of the Academy from 1818 to 1821. Death He died on 14 December 1823 and is buried in Assistens Cemetery. Works Dajon: Autumn, 1783 Dajon has only left a relatively small body of work. His best works are from the 1780s and 1790s. His style remained more closely influenced by his training under Saly than the Classicism that would later become fashionable. His works from this period include the allegorical sculptures of Spring Summer and Autumn for Vodroffslund (now in the Danish National Gallery), Tapperhed and Borgerdyd for the Liberty Column (possibly after Nicolai Abildgaard's sketches). Jens Lowson by Nicolai Dajon, 1786 He has also created a number of portrait busts and reliefs. These include a portrait bust of Crown Prince Frederick from 1783 (Sorø Academy). His marble bust of A. P. Bernstorff created for Landhusholdningsselskabet (now Frederiksborg Museum) is believed to be a copy of Bertel Thorvaldsen's Bernstorff bust, although it may also be the other way round. He has for instance created portrait medallions of A. C. Hviid (Regensen), Jens Low-zon (Danish National Gallery) and Christian VII (Christiansborg Court Theatre). A bust of Ludvig Holberg (1784) is now located in the Royal Danish Theatre. After the turn of the century, his work was almost exclusively confined to grave monuments of heterogeneous artistic quality. A number of these are located in Assistens Cemetery. He would occasionally also receive a portrait commission. A couple of times he would also collaborate with other artists on decorative assignments. He collaborated with Nicolai Abildgaard on the memorial decorations for Frederik VI and the Battle of Copenhagen (Slaget paa Reden) at Nørrejylland's arsenal in Randers (c. 1805) and with Peder Malling on the monument to Tordenskjold in the Church of Holmen. His portrait relief of the naval hero was based on Balthasar Denner's portrait painting.

Life and work He was born in 1960 to an American father and a Spanish mother. His father's abandonment of the family has marked Hernandez Velez's work, with its recurring themes of loss and identity. In 1976, he moved to Mallorca for familial reasons. He had already started to write poetry, and received the Ciutat de Palma prize in 1981 for his first book of poems Crònica dels argonautes. He dropped out of the University of the Balearic Islands and became a school teacher in Sóller, a mountainous town in the north of Mallorca. In 1985, he gave up his job as a teacher to focus on his novel Naturaleza, the writing of which took him three years.

Sunday school above Post Office Yard, Burley in Wharfedale, 1835 In 1835, Clapham and the curate from St Mary's converted the upper storey of three cottages at Post Office Yard into a non- denominational Sunday School. It closed in 1837 when a new curate, hired \\"at a liberal salary\\" by Mrs Anderton of Burley House, started a rival ecumenical Sunday school in Back Lane. Clapham later built the schoolroom close to the Salem chapel to replace his earlier one. Another version of this story says that in the early 1830s Clapham was superintendent of the Queen Street Sunday School when the vicar of St Mary's asked him to open and run a village school. However a new curate tried to make the new venture an Anglican school. The Sunday School teachers wanted a non-denominational school, and this was why he saw fit to commission the Salem Chapel and its Sunday school with support from \\"Leeds, Bradford and elsewhere.\\" Burley Grange, 1839–1840 Burley Grange (now The Grange) replaced a previous Burley Grange which was still standing in 1837. The new one was commissioned by Claphem and completed in 1840, although at the beginning of 1841 he was still living at Burley Hall. In 1849 Burley Grange was sold, to be later owned by Standfield, Emley and Hodson among others. Burley Urban District Council (which from 1937 was Ilkley Urban District Council) bought it in 1905. Thus it became the council office, the public library, and Grange Men's Club. It was then purchased by Bradford College for adult education, and closed again in 2006. Alan Hayes of Business Support and Development purchased Burley Grange in January 2009 with the intention of reopening it in the following August as a centre for business and education.

The schoolroom was a revival of his previous Sunday school which had closed in 1837. He laid the foundation stone of the chapel on 14 October 1849. Mary Ann, his wife, laid the cornerstone for the schoolroom on the same day. The chapel, consecrated on 29 July 1840, was intended for “the special use of the congregation of Protestant Dissenters of the International Order.” The building, in the \\"Pointed style of the 12th century,\\" originally had a balcony and a vestry inside. Between the chapel and the school was a graveyard, which was last used in 1896. In 1920, a 1911 German-made organ was installed in the chapel, replacing a harmonium. By 1987 the German organ had fallen into disrepair and was replaced in 1990 with an Wyvern organ. An accessible entrance was attached to the rear or south end of the church in 2005. Between at least 1858 and 1969 it was a Congregationalist church. The building is now in use as a United Reformed church.

Clapham was one of the founders of this charity and building; he was a subscriber to the charity from 1842. As of 2020 the building was in use as Abbeyfield Grove House Care Home. Nonconformist chapel at Grove Road Cemetery, Harrogate, 1863 The 4.5 acre site for Grove Road Cemetery, Harrogate, was purchased in 1862. It once had two chapels with spires, designed by Thomas Charles Sorby (1836–1924) of London, at a cost of £5,000. Clapham laid the foundation stone for the non-denominational chapel on 23 May 1863. One of the ministers who spoke at the ceremony was Rev. John Henry Gavin, the first minister of West Park Congregational Church, Harrogate. Gavin was to be buried there himself at age 38 in 1868. Having processed from the National School to the cemetery with interested parties including eleven clergymen and various Burial Board members, the Bishop of Ripon consecrated the episcopalian half of the cemetery and the Anglican chapel on 23 April 1864. Although the chapels formed an \\"attractive feature in the landscape,\\" they were both demolished in 1958 to create more burial space.

It was first aired over DZMM-AM from April 2003 to May 5, 2020 and was simulcast on its sister cable television channel from its launch in February 2007 until July 31, 2020. It resumed airing over DZRH and DZRH News Television on August 31, 2020. Created by Angelo Palmones, the program is hosted by Anthony Taberna and Gerry Baja. History=DZMM: 2003–2020 Dos por Dos was the brainchild of then-DZMM manager Angelo Palmones. The program name was derived from the Filipino slang term for the length and width of a wooden jack. Network promotional material touted its hard-hitting commentary format as being likened to the strength of the jack's striking when it is being utilized for construction. Prior to getting the job of the show's program hosts, Taberna and Baja were concurrently serving as DZMM Radyo Patrol field reporters and already paired as co-anchors for the station's weekend current affairs show Ito ang Radyo Patrol which they handled from 1999 to 2002. The program premiered in April 2003 as a half-hour commentary program at the 7:30 am slot. Initially, the hosts tried to emulate the formal, high-brow and seriously-toned commentary programs of the time before retooling to exchanges of wacky banter interspersed between interview segments and field reports. This proved to be successful and by 2007, prior to the launch of DZMM TeleRadyo, the show was expanded to an hour and expanded to the late afternoon slot as lead-in to the radio station's simulcast of TV Patrol, a position it held until 2020. In 2011, due to programming changes, most notably with Noli de Castro's Kabayan moving to the 6:00 am slot, the morning edition of Dos por Dos was moved to 5:00 am, more concentrating on early-morning field reports. With Gerry Baja's addition as co-host to ABS-CBN's morning show Umagang Kay Ganda in January 2012, the program was retooled again with its first fifteen minutes acting as a news rundown on a three-way simulcast with the morning show, TeleRadyo and 630 AM. This lasted until 2013 when Taberna decided to concentrate on television duties, leaving Baja alone to host a new program titled Garantisadong Balita, which replaced the morning edition. On May 5, 2020, Dos por Dos aired its final broadcast on 630 AM as a part of breaking news coverage surrounding the issuance of a cease and desist order from the NTC against ABS-CBN's terrestrial broadcast assets as its legislative franchise expired the day before, with Taberna, Baja, and Alvin Elchico anchoring the proceedings. It resumed on May 8 through cable on the provisionally-rebranded TeleRadyo, with occasional pre-emptions on days when the House of Representatives scheduled hearings concerning the ABS-CBN legislative franchise. However, as a result of retrenchments following the House committee vote denying the network a fresh legislative broadcast franchise, the show ended on July 31, 2020 with both Taberna and Baja's contracts terminated on the same date. Its vacated timeslot was absorbed by its lead-in Pasada sa TeleRadyo (the erstwhile Pasada Sais Trenta) effective August 3. DZRH: 2020–present In the interim, numerous unconfirmed reports concerning the show's future circulated. Among those were reported talks between the hosts and Radyo5 92.3 News FM, and Super Radyo DZBB, while others postulated a possible split with Baja eyeing to move to DWIZ. However, reported talks with DZRH to accommodate the two were first disclosed through The Philippine Star entertainment columnist Ricky Lo. The move became confirmed and official on August 20, 2020 with the two hosts signing the contract within the Manila Broadcasting Company's premises. DZRH anchor Deo Macalma further disclosed that the two hosts were greenlit by Ging Reyes to continue using the name as it was not put up for patenting by ABS-CBN. The transfer would also reunite the two hosts with the show's original creator Angelo Palmones. Dos por Dos resumed as a 90-minute show on August 31, 2020 through DZRH at 5:00 pm. Its format remained the same while adding a half-hour news rundown as lead-off segment.

One of the largest centers of innovation in Central and Eastern Europe. The park was opened in 2017 in Kyiv on the territory of the former Kyiv Motorcycle Plant. As of 2020, there are 108 resident companies in the innovation park. These include four laboratories, three business campuses and coworkings, eight accelerators and three investment funds to support and develop Ukrainian startups. In total, it is estimated that the park will accommodate 15,000 professionals and the total area of real estate in the park should be 500,000 square meters. The second phase of UNIT.City development will be completed by 2025. In result there should be a favorable ecosystem for business development and research, which will help create companies that are successful in the global market. The cost of the project is estimated at more than $700-800.  History  UNIT.City was founded by Vasyl Khmelnytsky in 2017. The project is funded by the holding company UFuture Investment Group. UDP, KAN Development and the European Investment Bank are co-inventors of the project. The first resident of the innovation park was the free programming school UNIT Factory. By 2019, the innovation park was built by leading partners Maxim Bakhmatov and Max Yakover. In autumn 2019, UNIT.City was headed by a new top management team consisting of managing partner Konstantin Yevtushenko, partner and CFO Kirill Bondar and CEO Dominique Piotet. \\"The Beacon\\" In October 2019, the light installation \\"The Beacon\\" was completed. The tallest factory pipe in Kyiv (60 meters) was converted into a light installation — a symbol of the future. As darkness falls, the light gradually rises up along the tube. Reaching the top, a bright ray lights up in the sky over Kyiv. The length of the beam reaches 100 meters. In the middle of the pipe is a metal platform, where there are three floodlights with halogen lamps with a capacity of 7.5 kW each. Different variants of pipe operation scenarios have been developed, depending on events and seasons. Appropriate beacons for aircraft orientation are also installed at the top of the pipe. \\"The Beacon\\" became the winner of the international competition LIT Lighting Design Awards in the nomination Light Art Project. In 2019, the B12 campus of the UNIT.City innovation park was the first in Ukraine to receive a silver LEEDv.4 Core & Shell certificate from the US Environmental Protection Board (USGBC). In February 2020, UNIT.City and the Ministry of Education and Science signed a memorandum of cooperation. In May 2020, UNIT Factory ceased its activities. The UCode educational IT program was launched on the basis of UNIT Factory. It was initiated by UFuture and InSoft Partners. The program is based on the Challenge Based Learning methodology, which was initiated by Apple and used at the Apple Developer Academy. thumb On July 1, 2020, an agreement was concluded under which the European Investment Bank provides a loan of 50 million euros to UNIT.City. On July 15, 2020, UNIT.City announced the launch of the NEST project for startups. NEST combines an accelerator and an incubator; meeting place and platform for attracting investments; HR-hub and \\"bridge\\" to Western markets for talented Ukrainians who have their own quality product. As of July 2020, NEST includes Bootcamp and eResidence. On July 16, 2020, the Ukrainian Startup Fund and UNIT.City signed a memorandum on strategic cooperation.  Other cities  In Lviv and Kharkiv, investors are developing local innovation parks. Thus, in 2019, the UNIT.Factory programming school was opened in Kharkiv, as well as coworking. In Lviv, an innovation park LvivTech.City is under construction, with an area of 1.77 hectares. The park is located in the industrial zone of the former Lvivprilad plant.

Background  The exploration for natural gas under the United Kingdom’s sector of the North Sea began in 1964. The first gas was found in September 1965 by the self- elevating drilling rig Sea Gem. Tragically, on 27 December 1965 Sea Gem collapsed and sank 43 miles east of the Humber. Thirteen of the crew of 32 were killed. A tribunal was appointed in February 1967 to establish the circumstances of the accident. The hearing lasted 29 days, and the tribunal report was published on 26 July 1967. The report identified that statutory provisions for regulating the safety of offshore installations, together with credible sanctions, should be available for installations working on the United Kingdom continental shelf. The Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971, enacted these measures which gave the Government the powers to regulate the safety, health and welfare on offshore installations.  Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971  The Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971(1971 c. 61) received Royal Assent on 27 July 1971.

This states that \\"All the provisions of the Act other than sections 4 and 5 shall come into force on 1 May 1972 and sections 4 and 5 of the Act shall come into force on 31st August 1972.\\"  Consequential legislation  The 1971 Act empowered the Secretary of State to make a wide range of Regulations, a sample of these include: * The Offshore Installations (Registration) Regulations 1972 Statutory Instrument 1972 No. 702 * The Offshore Installations (Managers) Regulations 1972 Statutory Instrument 1972 No. 703 * The Offshore Installations (Logbooks and Registration of Death) Regulations 1972 Statutory Instrument 1972 No. 1542 * The Offshore Installations (Public Inquiries) Regulations 1974 Statutory Instrument 1974 No. 338 * The Offshore Installations (Construction and Survey) Regulations 1974 Statutory Instrument 1974 No. 289 * The Offshore Installations (Emergency Procedures) Regulations 1976 Statutory Instrument 1976 No. 1542 * The Offshore Installations (Operational Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations 1976 Statutory Instrument 1976 No. 1019 * The Offshore Installations (Life-saving Appliances) Regulations 1977 Statutory Instrument 1977 No. 486 * The Offshore Installations (Fire-fighting Equipment) Regulations 1978 Statutory Instrument 1978 No. 611.  Certification  The Offshore Installations (Construction and Survey) Regulations 1974 (Statutory Instrument 1974 No. 289) established a certification regime. Offshore duty holders (oil and gas companies) appointed a Certifying Authority to inspect the design, construction and operation of their installation(s) against published guidance. The Certifying Authorities were the major ship classification societies: Lloyd's Register of Shipping, Bureau Veritas, Germanisher Lloyd's, Det Norske Veritas, American Bureau of Shipping.Offshore Petroleum Exploitation: the United Kingdom Legislation, Les Plates-formes Offshore, Travaux du premier Congrès de la SFDE (Strasbourg, les 6, 7 et 8 mai 1975) The Petroleum Engineering Division of the Department of Energy audited the Certifying Authorities, for compliance with their duties under the legislation and the against the guidance.

Following the Piper Alpha disaster and the Inquiry by Lord Cullen the Offshore Safety Act 1992 (1992 c. 15) was enacted to better regulate offshore safety. The provisions of the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 were made relevant statutory provisions of the Offshore Safety Act. As of August 2020, Sections 1 to 6, 8, 10, and the Schedule of the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 have been repealed by subsequent legislation. Only Sections 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are still in force.

Whilst she was there she wrote The Pool of Ch’ien Lung which was about her time in China in 1936. She retired at the same time as Miss Starkey and they went to live together in Salisbury. Her work Jesus and Woman was published in 1946 and it was abridged and retitled as The Master Calleth for Thee and published in America. It sold over 130,000 copies and was republished in Britain under its original title. The book looks through all four gospels and discusses the role of women with Christianity.

S. Gold (March 2, 1818 — March 20, 1906), was an American farmer and schoolteacher who served as Secretary of the State of Connecticut Board of Agriculture (1866–1901) and trustee of the Connecticut Agricultural College from its founding in 1881 through 1901. He played a vital role in establishing the college and fostering agriculture in the state.  Early life and education  Gold was born in Madison, New York, on March 2, 1818. He was a son of Dr. Samuel Wadsworth Gold and Phebe (Cleveland) Gold. His family moved to Cornwall, Connecticut, that same year, returning to his father's ancestral farm. In 1824, the family moved to Goshen, where the doctor practiced medicine for fifteen years before returning to Cornwall to cultivate the family farm. Gold attended local public schools and Goshen Academy. Like his father and grandfather before him, Gold attended Yale University, graduating with his bachelor's degree in 1838. He spent the following three years teaching in Goshen and Waterbury academies while pursuing graduate coursework in medicine, botany, and mineralogy at Yale.  Career  Gold believed that agricultural education was key to improving the quantity and quality of crops for Connecticut's struggling farmers. In 1845, Gold and his father founded the Cream Hill Agricultural School on their family farm. The school remained in operation until Samuel Gold's death in 1869. The all-boys school never had more than 24 students at a time, but it graduated a total of 272, some as far afield as Louisiana, Michigan, Germany, and Peru. Gold and his father were the only full-time instructors, teaching subjects from practical farming and military drill to foreign languages and piano. Gold was a charter member of the Connecticut State Agricultural Society in 1852. He and his wife were charter members of the Cornwall Grange and held most meetings in their home. Gold edited The Homestead, an agricultural paper, from 1856 to 1861. In 1864, he obtained from the Connecticut General Assembly a charter for the Connecticut Soldiers' Orphans' Home in Mansfield. He served as secretary of the corporation until 1874. In August 1866, Gold was appointed Secretary of the Connecticut Board of Agriculture, established by the General Assembly earlier that year. After his father's death and Cream Hill's closure in 1869, Gold devoted himself to the work of the board. Initially formed as a clearinghouse for the state's farmers, Gold's leadership ensured its reconstitution in 1871 as an administrative and regulatory agency, with the power to quarantine diseased animals, appoint state officials, and shape policy. Gold convinced the legislature to establish the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (the nation's first state-sponsored agricultural experiment station) in 1875. He served as secretary of the station's board of control for many years. Gold was a major influence in arranging for the state to charter the Storrs Agricultural School in 1881. The school became Connecticut's land-grant college, taking away the title and Morrill Act subsidy from Yale. Gold served as trustee of the future University of Connecticut from 1881 to 1901 and exerted a powerful influence on its development. He wrote the trustees' annual reports and continually lobbied the General Assembly for increased funding. The college named its first dormitory Gold Hall in his honor (the building burned down in 1914). The college was the culmination of Gold's use of \\"progressive means such as education, scientific methods and state organization to preserve the traditional values and social position of the Connecticut farmer.\\" In addition to his state-wide activities, Gold was an active citizen of Cornwall. Although he never sought elected office, he was appointed to many town committees, taking a special interest in fiscal affairs and education. He served as deacon of the North Cornwall Congregational Church for many years. \\"To him,\\" remarked one historian, \\"the pillars of society were family, farm, and church.\\" Later in life, Gold became a committed conservationist. He served as the first vice president of the Connecticut Forestry Association, formed in 1895 to “develop public appreciation of the value of forests and the need for preserving and using them rightly.” Gold’s son, Charles Lockwood Gold, also a Yale graduate and farmer, served as the association's vice president in the 1920s. Gold retired as secretary of the Board of Agriculture and trustee of the Connecticut Agricultural College in 1901, at the age of 83. In retirement, he continued to give speeches, publish essays, and edit the Handbook of Connecticut Agriculture and the Descriptive Catalogue of Farms in Connecticut for Sale. He wrote an unfinished history of Connecticut Agricultural College.  Personal life  In 1843, Gold married Caroline E. Lockwood of Bridgeport. They had three daughters: Eleanor Gold Hubbard, Rebecca Gold Cornell and Caroline Gold Gibson. Gold's first wife died in 1857. In 1859, Gold married Emma Tracey Baldwin (1835–1927) of Rockville. They had two sons and two daughters: Alice Gold Puttkamer, Martha Gold Morgan, Charles L. Gold, and James Gold. Gold died at his home in West Cornwall on March 20, 1906. He was survived by his wife and children. His body was interred at the North Cornwall Cemetery.  References  External links  * T. S.

This is distinct from textual nusach, the exact text of the prayer service, which varies somewhat between Jewish communities. Description The whole musical style or tradition of a community is sometimes referred to as its nusach, but this term is most often used in connection with the chants used for recitative passages, in particular the Amidah. Many of the passages in the prayer book, such as the Amidah and the Psalms, are chanted in a recitative rather than either read in normal speech or sung to a rhythmical tune. The recitatives follow a system of musical modes, somewhat like the maqamat of Arabic music. For example, Ashkenazi cantorial practice distinguishes a number of steiger (scales) named after the prayers in which they are most frequently used, such as the Adonoi moloch steiger and the Ahavoh rabboh steiger. Mizrahi communities such as the Syrian Jews use the full maqam system. The scales used may vary both with the particular prayer and with the season. For examples, there are often special modes for the High Holy Days, and in Syrian practice the scale used depends on the Torah reading for the week (see The Weekly Maqam). In some cases the actual melodies are fixed, while in others the reader has freedom of improvisation. Musical modes Jewish liturgical music is characterized by a set of musical modes. The prayer modes form part of what is known as the musical nusach (tradition) of a community, and serve both to identify different types of prayer and to link those prayers to the time of year or even time of day in which they are set. Various Jewish traditions developed their own modal systems, such as the maqamat of the Middle Eastern Jewish communities. The modes discussed in this article are specific to the traditions of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish Communities. There are three main modes, as well as a number of combined or compound modes. The three main modes are called Ahavah Rabbah, Magein Avot and Adonai Malach. Traditionally, the cantor (hazzan) improvised sung prayers within the designated mode, while following a general structure of how each prayer should sound. Over time many of these chants have been written down and standardized, yet the practice of improvisation still exists to this day. Early studies in the history of Jewish Prayer Modes concluded that the musical scales used were based upon ancient Biblical cantillation,Cohon, 17 but modern scholarship has questioned the validity of these findings. Ahavah Rabbah mode Basic Ahavah Rabbah scale The Ahavah Rabbah mode – sometimes referred to as Freygish (Phrygian dominant) – is named after the blessing that immediately precedes the Sh'ma in the morning service. This blessing begins with the words Ahavah Rabbah (literally: great love), and describes how God's love for Israel is manifest through God's revelation of Torah. Musically, Ahavah Rabbah is considered to be the most Jewish-sounding of all the prayer modes, because of the interval of a flattened second, creating a minor third interval between the second and third scale degrees.Cohon, 11 This mode is used in the beginning of the weekday evening service through the Chatzi Kaddish, a large portion of the weekday morning service, parts of the Shabbat morning service, and occasionally on the High Holidays. The Ahavah Rabbah mode is also used in many Jewish folk songs, such as \\"Hava Nagila\\", and popular liturgical melodies, such as \\"Yismechu\\". It is similar to the Arabic maqam Hijaz, but whereas the dominant of Hijaz is on the fourth degree, Ahavah Rabbah strongly favors the third. =Ukrainian Dorian mode= Basic Ukrainian Dorian scale The Ukrainian Dorian mode (also known as Misheberach mode) is a combined scale built upon the seventh degree of the Ahavah Rabbah scale. It is also closely related to the Magein Avot mode, in that a pre- concluding phrase in Ukrainian Dorian can cadence on its supertonic, which is the 5th degree of the relative Magein Avot scale. This happens quite often in the nusach for the Three Festivals.Cohon, 52 It is similar to the Arabic maqam Nikriz. Magein Avot mode Basic Magein Avot scale The Magein Avot (literally: Shield of our Fathers) mode takes its name from a paragraph in the Me'ein Sheva prayer, which directly follows the Amidah in the Friday evening service. Musically, it most closely resembles a minor scale from the Western classical music tradition or the Arabic maqam Nahawand. It is used in simple davening, or prayer chant, often by means of a single recitation tone, which the cantor uses to cover a large amount of liturgical text in a quickly- flowing style. The simplicity of both the mode and the chanting associated with it is meant to reflect the peaceful atmosphere of Shabbat. When chanting in the Magein Avot mode, it is common for the cantor to pivot into the relative major at certain liturgical points, often to highlight a particular line of text. It is this use of the relative major, in concert with Magein Avot, that distinguishes the mode from a regular minor scale. In addition to Shabbat evening, the Magein Avot mode is also prominent for the opening blessings of the weekday morning and afternoon services.Cohon, 107-110 =Yishtabach mode= The Yishtabach mode is a variant of the Magein Avot scale that flattens the second scale degree. Adonai (HaShem) Malach mode Basic Adonai Malach scale (Adonai malakh mode on D) Adonai malakh mode on C.Gottlieb, Jack (2004). Funny, It Doesn't Sound Jewish, p.11. . The Adonai malach (literally: God Reigns) mode consists of a major scale with a lowered (minor) seventh and tenth. This mode has a majestic feel to it and is used for a number of services that require a grand atmosphere. Traditionally, it is used for psalms 95–99 in Kabbalat Shabbat, Lekhah Dodi in Kabbalat Shabbat, and the Friday night Kiddush. On Shabbat morning it is used for the Avot and G'vurot, during the Torah service, and on Rosh Chodesh when blessing the new month. Adonai Malach mode is also used at various times during the High Holidays when a majestic quality is required, such as the Shofar service, and parts of the Amidah. In High Holiday contexts, the seventh and tenth degrees are often raised, causing the mode to strongly resemble the classical major scale.Cohon, 142-143 \\"Adonai malakh\\" (\\"God is King\\"), a line from Psalm 93, is set using the Adonai malakh scale at the close of the introduction to the Kabalat Shabat (Friday evening synagogue service).Gottlieb (2004), p.122. It adds flats as it goes higher, and its pitch set is similar to the Persian Dastgāh-e Māhur and Russian Obikhod scale. Maneuvers Maneuvers are used within prayer chants in order to change the mood and mode during prayer. There are a few characteristic moves that cantors tend to use in order to modulate through various modes. Two of the most common maneuvers are the Yishtabach maneuver and the Sim Shalom maneuver.  Yishtabach maneuver  The Yishtabach maneuver moves from Magein Avot to Adonai Malach on the 4th degree of the scale. It then moves through Ukrainian Dorian and back to Magein Avot. This maneuver helps to highlight the grandeur of the proclamation of God's name that occurs in the final blessing of the Shabbat morning service.Cohon, 90  Sim Shalom maneuver  The Sim Shalom maneuver, which is named after the Sim Shalom prayer, in which it often occurs, begins in Ahavah Rabbah, and modulates to the major key on the fourth degree of the scale. It also uses Ukrainian Dorian as a shift back to the original Ahavah Rabbah.Cohon, 91 ReferencesWorks cited * Cohon, Baruch Joseph. \\"The Structure of Synagogue Prayer Chant.\\" Journal of the American Musicological Society 3, no. 1, 17–32, 1950.

Plot With smoke from a brazier, a magician makes a woman appear in midair and slowly float to the ground. Two assistants bring in an arrangement of pedestals, onto which they lead the woman. The magician blows soap bubbles through a straw, and they appear as women's faces, floating up to join the woman posing on the set of pedestals. Next they themselves change into real butterfly-winged women, before the whole tableau disappears. Having his assistants bring on a wide plinth, the magician summons up the three women again, joining them on the plinth before they fade away. Finally, the magician curls up into a ball, becomes a giant soap bubble, and floats slowly upward. The magician returns to join his surprised assistants in a curtain call. Production Méliès is the magician in the film, which combines stage machinery, pyrotechnics, substitution splices, multiple exposures, and dissolves to create its illusions. The opening title card is hand-lettered as in three other films by Méliès made around the same time: Rip's Dream (1905), The Tramp and the Mattress Makers (1906), and The Witch (1906). Méliès's final trick, curling into a fetal position and disappearing into the womb of the bubble, is reminiscent of his later film The Knight of Black Art (1907), in which he disappears into a large hoop. In both cases, he returns at the end of the film to reassure his frightened assistants. Release and legacy Soap Bubbles was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 846–848 in its catalogues. At his stage venue, the Théâtre Robert-Houdin, Méliès did a magic act between 1907 and 1910 developing the soap-bubble motif from the film. In the stage act, a ghost slept on a stool, with huge soap bubbles come out of his head as he snored. Three such bubbles floated around the stage, and three phosphorescent ghostly heads appeared inside them.

In 1985, had 70 receptions for 1,057 yards and nine touchdowns and also scored a touchdown on a 60-yard punt return. Crawford had been selected in the first round (24th pick) of the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL players by the San Francisco 49ers and signed with the team after the USFL folded in 1986. He played one season for the team, catching five passes for 70 yards. Crawford returned to professional football in 1990 when he joined the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). In 1992, Crawford had 47 receptions for 714 yards and five touchdowns in the regular season was the leading receiver with 162 yards in the Stampeders 80th Grey Cup victory. After sitting out the 1994 season Crawford was signed by the Birmingham Barracudas, formed as part of the CFL's attempted expansion into the United States, in 1995.

The film, of which only fragments are known to survive, featured Méliès as a magician making playing-card figures come to life in miniature. Plot A magician transforms a marble statue into a living woman, who acts as his assistant. She puts a pack of playing cards in a glass box; four cards (the king of spades, the queen of hearts, the queen of clubs, and the king of diamonds) jump out of the pack into the magician's hands. When the magician puts the four cards on a platform, the kings and queens depicted on them come to life as tiny people, and dance a minuet. Then the kings and queens return to their places on the cards. The magician takes up the cards and makes them disappear, and he and his assistant take a bow. Production Méliès is the magician in the film, which reuses props and costumes from The Living Playing Cards, a film he had made earlier in the year. In turn, he reused the effect of superimposing people at different sizes in a film released the following year, The Hilarious Posters. The special effects were created using substitution splices and multiple exposures. Release and survival The Lilliputian Minuet was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 690–692 in its catalogues. A print of the film was preserved at the Filmoteca Española in Madrid, with a copy held in the possession of the Méliès family; the print contains a large part of the action, but is missing the ending and part of the statue transformation.

It covered most of the eastern part of the colony along the Congo River south from Stanleyville. Location The explorer Henry Morton Stanley visited the area in 1883, and established a station that became the city of Kisangani below the Boyoma Falls, a series of cataracts. The river was navigable from Léopoldville up to this point. The station was known first as Falls Station and then as Stanleyville, and the falls were known as Stanley Falls. A decree of 3 September 1886 by the Congo Free State administrator general Camille Janssen defined nine districts in the colony, each headed by a district commissioner, including Stanley Falls District. Article 3 of the decree of 16 April 1887 provided for the Congo Free State to be divided into administrative districts headed by district commissioners, assisted by one or more deputies. The decree of 1 August 1888 divided the Congo Free State into eleven districts including Stanley Falls District with capital at Stanley Falls. An 1897 map of the Congo Free State showed the huge Stanley Falls District where the later Stanleyville and Katanga districts would be created. It covered an area of about . It was bounded by Uellé District to the northeast and Aruwimi District to the northwest, then by Lualaba Kassai District to the southwest. To the south and east it was bordered by English and German possessions. The district covered almost the whole Congo Basin south of the Stanley Falls. The boundary with Aruwimi District was defined by the Lomami River. From north to south, the eastern border included Lake Albert Nyassa, Lake Albert-Edward, Lake Tanganyika, Lake Moero and Lake Bangwelo. Later, Lake Bangweulu was determined to be within Northern Rhodesia. Lake Kivu was shown as contained within the district, although later it was found to be on the border between Rwanda and the Belgian Congo. A 1910 map of the Belgian Congo shows the districts after Stanley Falls District had been separated into Stanleyville District to the north and the vice-government general of Katanga to the south, with the Lualaba portion of Lualaba Kassai District transferred to Katanga. The reorganization had been done that year. History thumb In February 1887 Henry Morton Stanley arrived in Zanzibar. There he met Tippu Tip, his former opponent and head of a great trading empire in the eastern Congo region. Stanley told him Leopold II of Belgium wanted to make peace with the Arabs, and offered Tippu Tip the position of governor of Stanley Falls District (the king had approved this offer by telegram, but it originated with Stanley). Tippoo Tib accepted the offer, which gave a monthly salary of ₤30. He promised to raise the Belgian flag and to restrain his fellow Arabs from slaving and other depredations. A European officer would be attached to him, and would make regular reports to the Belgian king. King Leopold II collaborated with the Arabs at first, but disagreements arose over control of ivory and compliance with Leopold II's pledges to the Berlin Conference to end slavery. Leopold II's stance turned confrontational against his once-allies. The Congo–Arab War took place between the forces of King Leopold II of Belgium's Congo Free State and various Zanzibari Arab slave traders led by Sefu bin Hamid, the son of Tippu Tip. Fighting occurred in the eastern Congo between 1892 and 1894. It was a proxy war, with most of the fighting being done by native Congolese, who aligned themselves with either side and sometimes switched sides. The causes of the war were largely economic based, since Leopold and the Arabs were contending to gain control of the wealth of the Congo. In 1893 Louis-Napoléon Chaltin reached the Stanley Falls station (now Kisangani) when it was on the point of falling to the Swahilis. He defeated the Arab-led forces on 18 May 1893. After defeating them again at Kirundu, the Arabs were expelled from the region. The war ended in January 1894 with a victory of Leopold's Force Publique. On 15 July 1898 the Stanley Falls District became the Orientale Province, with Stanleyville as its headquarters. The Apostolic Prefecture of Stanley Falls was created on 3 August 1904 out of territory taken from the Apostolic Vicariate of Congo Belge.

His work as a designer is known by a number of art galleries in London, where his commissions include designs for exhibition posters and the design of rooms for the display of artworks, most notably at the Victoria and Albert Museum. His own artworks have been exhibited in London and New South Wales, Australia, and a selection of his architectural photographs are held in the Courtauld Institute of Art Conway photographic library in London.  Biography  Firmstone was born in 1937, the birth being registered in Rowley, Staffordshire. An entry in the United Kingdom Births, Marriages and Deaths Register, dated April 1965, records marriage to Joan G. Kenrick.  Career = Designer  Firmstone's work as designer was recognised by various art establishments particularly in London. This work includes designs for exhibition posters at the National Portrait Gallery, now held in the collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum. His work for the Royal Academy of Arts includes a poster for the exhibition Dante Gabriel Rossetti: Painter and Poet. Copies of the poster are archived in the collection of the British Council and Royal Academy. Firmstone designed the galleries for the 1976 Victoria and Albert Museum show A Tonic to the Nation, which commemorated the 1951 Festival of Britain and was co-organized by art historian Bevis Hillier. Firmstone is also credited with the cover design, with others, of the pamphlet that accompanied the exhibition, a reference to which can be found in The Victoria and Albert Museum: A Bibliography and Exhibition Chronology, 1852-1996, by Elizabeth James. Photographs of Firmstone's designs of Baroque in Bohemia, a 1969 show at the Victoria and Albert Museum, are reproduced in Michaela Malek's article which documents growing interest in Baroque design in the 1960s in Britain and Czechoslovakia. Malek notes that \\"Firmstone designed an architecture for the sculptures that recalled a vaulted basilica, with pillars and curving walls and niches for sculptures, which was ‘dramatically’ lit, supposedly to evoke the impression of a Baroque interior\\". When the Courtauld Gallery moved in 1990 to Somerset House, Firmstone led the design team to create the space for the hanging of paintings and placement of art objects in its collection.  Artist  Firmstone's artworks suggest the influence of Modernism. His artworks have been exhibited in London and in New South Wales, Australia. In 2017 his work was included in the exhibition ‘Contemporary British Art’ at the Millinery Works in London. His more recent works have appeared at galleries in New South Wales at the Bradford Studio. These works had previously been exhibited at the Yuill Crowley Gallery in 2018.  Photography  Alongside his work at the Courtauld Gallery, photographs attributed to Firmstone are held in the Conway Library at the Courtauld Insitute of Art Collection. The collection consists of mainly architectural images. Firmstone's photographs are of interiors of Somerset House, a building designed by the architect William Chambers (1723-1796).

The twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the very active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Laura originated from a large tropical wave that moved off the West African coast on August 16 and became a tropical depression on August 20\\\\. Laura intensified into a tropical storm a day later, becoming the earliest twelfth named storm on record in the North Atlantic basin, forming eight days earlier than 1995's Hurricane Luis. Laura first hit the Lesser Antilles and brushed Puerto Rico as a tropical storm, then moved across the island of Hispaniola, killing 31 people in Haiti and four in the Dominican Republic. The storm then moved across the length of Cuba, prompting tropical storm warnings and the evacuation of more than 260,000 people there. Subsequently, the outer rainbands extended into the Florida Keys and South Florida. Laura then moved across the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slowly at first, before a period of rapid intensification on August 26\\\\. That day, Laura became a major hurricane, and later attained peak 1-minute sustained winds of , making it a Category 4 hurricane. Early on August 27, Laura made landfall near peak intensity on Cameron, Louisiana. This was the tenth-strongest U.S. hurricane landfall by windspeed on record. The storm caused the deaths of at least 42 people in the U.S. and inflicted an estimated $14 billion in damages on southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas near the Gulf of Mexico. After landfall, Laura rapidly weakened as it moved inland, becoming a tropical storm later that day, and weakening further to a tropical depression over Arkansas the next day. On August 29, Laura degenerated into a remnant low over Kentucky, before being absorbed into another extratropical storm near the East Coast of the U.S. shortly afterward. Overall, Laura caused more than $14.1 billion in damage and 77 deaths. Areas that were affected by Laura, namely the Gulf Coast, were affected again six weeks later by Hurricane Delta. Meteorological history On August 16, 2020, a westward-moving tropical wave along the eastern end of a monsoon trough emerged off the west coast of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean. At this time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis over the next five days as environmental conditions gradually became more favorable for development. The system produced disorganized convection over a broad area, and steadily consolidated. A surface low accompanied by organizing banding features coalesced about 700 mi (1,120 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. By 03:00 UTC on August 20, the low and accompanying convection became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression, the thirteenth of the season, about 1,035 mi (1,670 km) east-southeast of the Leeward Islands. The depression moved briskly west- northwest in response to the Bermuda High to the north, a high that would steer the system throughout its lifetime. After struggling for over a day, the depression center reformed and an increase an organization and the presence of tropical storm-force winds prompted an upgrade to tropical storm status and storm was named Laura. This marked the earliest classification of a season's twelfth named storm since reliable records began in 1851, surpassing the previous record set by Hurricane Luis, on August 28, 1995. Moderate wind shear hampered further development through August 22, displacing the bulk of convection east of the surface circulation. Early on August 22, Laura traversed the Virgin Islands and sideswiped Puerto Rico to the south before making landfall in the southeastern Dominican Republic with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) early on August 23. Tropical Storm Laura over Cuba as seen from International Space Station Despite interacting with the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, the overall structure of Laura actually improved with little intensity loss. Laura subsequently traversed Haiti and emerged over the Windward Passage. Once back over water, the storm intensified some and made a brief landfall around 00:00 UTC on August 24 in Santiago de Cuba Province, Cuba, with winds of 60–65 mph (95–100 km/h) before emerging over the Caribbean Sea along Cuba's southern coast. Laura's structure briefly degraded on August 24 before it reorganized and traversed Pinar del Río Province in western Cuba, early on August 25. Maintaining a west-northwest trajectory, Laura entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and quickly organized throughout August 25, reaching hurricane-strength by 12:15 UTC. After moving out of an area of dry air, the hurricane began a period of rapid intensification on August 26. The storm grew in size and featured a defined eye surrounded by increasingly symmetric deep convection. By 12:00 UTC, Laura strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale before becoming a Category 4 hurricane six hours later. Continuing to strengthen into August 27, Laura reached its peak intensity of 150 mph (240 km/h), a high-end Category 4 hurricane, and a minimum pressure of 937 mbar (hPa; 27.67 inHg). At this time, the hurricane turned north toward the Texas-Louisiana coastline within a weakness along the western edge of the Bermuda High. Animated loop of Laura making landfall near Cameron, Louisiana, early on August 27 from the Lake Charles (KLCH) radar, before it failed at 12:53 a.m CDT (05:53 UTC) Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron, Louisiana, around 06:00 UTC on August 27 near peak strength as its pressure had risen by 1 mbar. Laura matched the strength of the 1856 Last Island hurricane for strongest landfall in the state and was the first Category 4 landfall on record in southwestern Louisiana. Progressing inland across southwestern Louisiana, Laura produced destructive winds over a wide area, although the storm rapidly weakened as it progressed farther inland. Steady filling of the storm and the disappearance of its eye ensued throughout the day, and Laura weakened to a tropical storm by 17:00 UTC about 50 mi (85 km) east-southeast of Shreveport. Maintaining tropical storm-force winds, the system progressed into southwestern Arkansas. By August 28, Laura degraded to a tropical depression over central Arkansas; heavy rain became the primary threat across the Southeast. Around that time, the NHC issued their final advisory on Laura, passing on the responsibility for issuing advisories to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). Gradually losing tropical characteristics, the weakening storm accelerated east- northeast within the mid-latitude westerlies. The system ultimately degenerated into a remnant low over Kentucky early on August 29, as it began merging with an approaching extratropical storm. Laura's remnant low continued moving eastward, before being absorbed into the approaching extratropical system several hours later, over Maryland. Preparations Hurricane Marco (left) and Tropical Storm Laura (right) on August 23. Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings were issued for almost all of the Greater Antilles. Lesser Antilles and Virgin Islands In preparation for the storm, schools were closed in Anguilla and Antigua. A tropical storm watch was issued for several islands in the group on August 20, being upgraded to a warning the next day. The storm prompted the closing of all ports in the British Virgin Islands. Dominican Republic A tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to the northern Haitian border. A red alert was also issued for 18 provinces, a yellow alert for 8, and a green alert for 6. Haiti Haitian authorities urged people to evacuate to shelters, but to remember to wear masks and respect social distancing orders in the areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Jamaica and Cayman Islands Although the center of Laura was forecast to remain north of Jamaica, associated rainbands on the southern side of the circulation were anticipated to bring significant precipitation. On August 23, the Jamaican Meteorological Service issued a flash flood watch for low-lying areas nationwide. This was later upgraded to a flash flood warning on August 24 as torrential rains affected the nation. Originally, the bulk of the storm was forecasted to stay north of the Cayman Islands, but as the forecast kept on shifting further southwest of earlier forecast, the projections of significant precipitation and for Tropical Storm conditions continued to increase. The Cayman Islands Government issued Tropical Storm Warning for their Islands on August 23\\\\. This was in addition to the Severe Weather Statements and Flood Warnings that were already posted. Cuba Ahead of Laura's first landfall in Cuba on August 23, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued throughout the nation. At one point, the western tip of Cuba was under both a tropical storm watch from Laura and a tropical storm warning from Hurricane Marco at the same time. Officials evacuated 106,000 people in Santiago de Cuba Province, 81,300 in Holguín Province, and 12,000 in Guantánamo Province. Power was preemptively cut across Guantánamo Province as a precautionary measure. On August 24, a further 45,000 people in Villa Clara Province, 16,466 people in Matanzas Province, and 300 in Ciego de Ávila Province were evacuated. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic complicated evacuation efforts, resulting in typical evacuation shelters such as schools not being opened. Those suspected of being infected were relocated to quarantine centers. Residents nationwide were alerted to the potential of widespread flooding as many reservoirs were at or near capacity. United States Hurricanes Marco and Laura threatened a large swath of oil rigs positioned across the Gulf of Mexico. By August 23, approximately 58 percent of oil production and 45 percent of natural gas production was shut down; this included the evacuation of 114 platforms. By August 25, 299 of 643 platforms and 27 of 28 mobile rigs were evacuated. Seven tornado watches were issued for this storm. They included the Coastal Waters as well as Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky. The staff at the NWS Lake Charles office also evacuated with warnings for their area being issued by NWS Brownsville. Three rare Extreme Wind Warnings were issued for Louisiana and Texas as Laura approached landfall. =Puerto Rico= Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vázquez declared a state of emergency, and FEMA teams were ready to help with recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. =Florida= On August 21, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for southern counties in the state. A mobile hospital unit was pre-staged in Marion County and personal protection equipment kits were readied for distribution to shelters. A tropical storm watch was issued for the Florida Keys as the storm approached, although the north side of the area was dropped when Laura went farther south than expected. The rest were eventually upgraded to warnings. The mayor of Monroe County, Heather Carruthers declared a local state of emergency, and mandatory evacuations for mobile homes and boats, although visitors were allowed to stay. =Texas= United States Coast Guard boats pre-staging at a NASA facility in Houston Road sign in Texas on August 25 Hurricane, tropical storm, and storm surge watches were issued for areas mainly near and east of Galveston on August 24. Most were upgraded to warnings the next day and a flash flood watch was also issued for the eastern portion of the state. On August 23, Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for 23 counties in eastern Texas. On August 25, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas of Chambers, Galveston and Jefferson counties, and for the entirety of Orange County. This included the entirety of the Bolivar Peninsula and cities of Galveston and Port Arthur. Galveston city officials advised residents that all city services would cease at noon on August 25 and upon the arrival of tropical storm-force winds, emergency services would be suspended. A total of 50 busses were used to assist in evacuations. A voluntary evacuation order was issued for coastal areas of Brazoria and Harris counties. An estimated 385,000 people were under evacuation orders in the state, including the entire city of Beaumont. =Louisiana= Soldiers and vehicles from the Louisiana Army National Guard reinforce a levee ahead of Hurricane Laura Hurricane, tropical storm, and storm surge watches were issued for almost the entire coastline on August 24\\\\. This came just hours after the southeastern portion of the state had their tropical storm and storm surge warnings for Marco cancelled. Most of the watches were upgraded to warnings the next day and a flash flood watch was also issued for the western half of the state as over of rain was expected. As the threat of surge increased for the coastline, the NHC stated that there would be \\"unsurvivable storm surge with large and destructive waves.\\" Due to the continued threat of Marco and Laura making landfall in Louisiana, on August 21, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency for 36 parishes. Evacuations related to Marco were in place for Plaquemines Parish, Jefferson Parish, Grand Isle, and Port Fourchon. A mandatory evacuation for the entirety of Calcasieu Parish, approximately 200,000 people, was ordered on August 25. State-run shelters were opened with cots spread farther apart due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Just hours before Laura made landfall on August 26, I-10 was shut down in both directions between the Louisiana/Texas border eastward to the Atchafalaya Basin. =Mississippi= Despite being well away from the center of the storm, the coastline of Mississippi was placed under a storm surge watch from Ocean Springs westward on August 24 due to the massive size of Laura. However, these were dropped before the storm made landfall. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency on August 22 due to both Hurricanes Laura and Marco threatening the state, which the federal government granted on August 24. =Arkansas= Search and rescue teams were put on standby as Governor Asa Hutchinson declared an emergency ahead of Hurricane Laura and set aside $250,000 to prepare for the storm's impacts. One day later President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the state of Arkansas.

Four tornadoes were confirmed in Alabama with three being rated EF1 while the other was rated EF0. Aftermath=Haiti Following the passage of Laura, Haiti's Directorate General of Civil Protection (DGCP) began damage assessments. The agency quickly distributed food kits to affected residents in the Ouest, Nippes, Sud-Est, and Sud departments. Water treatment products were sent to Anse-à-Pitres and Belle-Anse by the National Directorate for Drinking Water and Sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) deployed medical teams across the country to assist the Haitian National Red Cross Society, though transport of victims was hampered by limited access to ambulances. Eleven schools were converted to shelters; however, many evacuees opted to stay with neighbors or relatives due to fears of COVID-19. United States National Guard troops respond in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura in Lake Charles. The Capital One Tower in the background had many of its windows blown out. U.S. President Donald Trump at a FEMA meeting on August 27 The governors of both Texas and Louisiana surveyed storm damage in the hardest hit parts of their respective states after the storm had passed. Roads in both Calcasieu and Cameron Parishes in Louisiana were impassable, cutting off road access to both Cameron and Creole. About 200,000 people were left without drinking water after Laura made 80 water systems inoperable. Additionally, some areas saw complete destruction in their power grids, and over a million people lost power. Some areas were expected to be without power for weeks or even months. Multiple homes also were uninhabitable due to air conditioning units being destroyed. Recovery efforts were hampered by additional rainfall in the days after Laura had passed. After the storm, President Donald Trump approved a post-storm major disaster declaration for 23 parishes in Louisiana on August 27\\\\. Two days later, he visited the areas most heavily affected by the storm, including Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish, and Orange County. Trump visited the Cajun Navy, a rescue organization, and met with Governor John Bel Edwards. Post-storm assessments indicated extensive damage and losses to Louisiana's timber industry with some small private forest landowners reporting complete loss of their timber acreage, an outcome which they had not experienced in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita, 15 years earlier. Extensive damage was also reported to Louisiana's industrial facilities with one-third showing some type of damage and nine out of the 138 facilities showing critical damage, causing environmental concerns. Some of the most critically damaged facilities were the BioLab facility and the Equistar Chemicals facility in Westlake, and the Chemical Waste Management facility and the Lotte Chemical plant in Lake Charles. Many of the repairs in Louisiana were undone six weeks later by Hurricane Delta, which made landfall just east of where Hurricane Laura did, with many areas in and around hard-hit Lake Charles being damaged again.

His subsequent studies on the ANP-like stimulation of guanylyl cyclase by enterotoxins eventually led to new research venues into the study of guanylyl cyclase C and its role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Recently, Waldman has extensively explored concepts surrounding the role of membrane- bound GUCY2C receptors lining the gastrointestinal tract in relation to the homeostatic regulation of the crypt-surface axis by paracrine hormones uroguanylin and guanylin. His recent research includes the experimental targeting of such receptors in various ways for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal neoplasias, including (under his leadership) a phase-I clinical trial to test a recombinant vaccine against colorectal cancer aimed to immunize against GUCY2C receptors.

The genus is known from fossil fruits and leaves found in the early Eocene deposits of northern Washington state, United States, and southern British Columbia, Canada. The species was initially described as a member of the related extinct genus Concavistylon as \\"Concavistylon\\" wehrii, but subsequently moved to the new genus Paraconcavistylon in 2020 after additional study. Distribution and paleoenvironment Paraconcavistylon wehrii is known from specimens which were recovered from outcrops of the early Eocene, Ypresian Klondike Mountain Formation in Republic and coeval McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, British Columbia. The Klondike Mountain Formation and McAbee Fossil sites preserve upland temperate floras which were first interpreted as being microthermal, however further study has shown the floras to be more mesothermal in nature. The plant community preserved in the Klondike Mountain formation is a mixed conifer–broadleaf forest with large pollen elements of birch and golden larch, but also having notable traces of fir, spruce, cypress, and palm. Taxonomy and phylogeny The holotype was originally collected by Dwyane Day 1999 and subsequently donated to the University of Washington's Burke Museum as specimen UWBM PB 101336. One of the paratypes, specimen USNM 537360 is the earliest collected specimen, being recovered in 1901 by then Washington State Geologist Harry Landis. Study of the fossil by paleobotanists Steven Manchester et al resulted in the description of \\"Concavistylon\\" wehrii being published in 2018, 117 years after the Landis specimen was found. The specific name wehrii was chosen as a patronym honoring Wesley \\"Wes\\" Wehr for his enthusiasm and generosity. Often plant fossils are isolated parts such as leaves or seeds, which makes it difficult to identify relationships to other isolated parts. Such fossils from the same species are described as morphospecies. \\"Rosetta Stone\\" fossils are rare cases of multiple portions of a fossil preserved in connection. The holotype of Paraconcavistylon has been described as a Rosetta Stone fossil as it bears an infructescence attached to branchlet that also has leaves and terminal buds connected, allowing for a fuller plant description than is usually possible. The description of Paleocene trochodendraceous fossils from Wyoming and a phylogenetic analysis of two living and four extinct genera indicated that Concavistylon was not monophyletic. Based on the pendulous nature of \\"C.\\" wehrii inflorescences, which are distinct from the erect inflorescences of C. kvacekii, the new genus Paraconcavistylon was erected with \\"C.\\" wehrii as the type species. Paraconcavistylon wehrii is one of between three and four trochodendraceae species that have been described from the Klondike Mountain Formation. Broadly circumscribed three other species have been identified at Republic, Pentacentron sternhartae, Tetracentron hopkinsii, and Trochodendron nastae. Additionally the species Trochodendron drachukii is known from related Kamloops group shales at the McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, British Columbia. Manchester et al. 2018B noted that Tr. drachukii is likely the fruits of Tr. nastae, while Pe. sternhartae are likely the fruits of Te. hopkinsii. If fossils of the fruits and foliage in attachment are found, that would bring the species count down to three whole plant taxa. Description The fruiting bodies of Paraconcavistylon wehrii are simple racemes that taper from a wide base down to a tip under wide, with lengths of up to and over . Fruit capsules are born on pedicels which curve upwards towards the raceme apex in a helical pattern and the longest preserved raceme has 33 attached fruits, though the specimen is missing both basal and apical sections. Given the length of the racemes, they likely hung down like a pendulum, with the fruits pointing downwards. Each of the smooth teardrop shaped fruits is between wide by tall. They have a slight thickening in the basal area where a ring of perianth scars encircling the connection with the pedicel is, but are widest near the fruit apex. Between four and six long persistent styles are arranged just below the midpoint of the capsules and curving upwards towards the capsule apex. At the base of each style are swollen elliptical bulges that likely were nectaries. The fruits opened at the apex, with a four to six rayed star pattern formed by the dehiscence splits which run from just above the styles to the fruit apex where they join together. P. wehrii twigs have alternating leaves with terminal and axillary buds. The raceme is born from a fork of the twig and leaf, as are the pointed buds. Typically the axillary buds are around long by while the terminal buds are larger at long by . Encircling the twig are between five and eight distinct terminal bud scars. The leaves have a narrow base connecting to the long petioles. They have regularly spaced teeth along the margin that are rounded and bearing glands, and a few specimens from the McAbee site also have distinct laminal lobes bracketing the petiole. The leaves have an overall range between long by , with an obovate outline. Like Trochodendron the leaves have a pinnate vein structure, with between eight and fifteen secondary veins that fork from the central main vein and arch towards the leaf apex before merging with the secondary above.

Personal life  Chemancheri Kunhiraman Nair was raised in the village of Cheliya near Kozhikode/Calicut. His mother died when he was only three years old, and then, at the age of thirteen, he lost his father. He had an early interest in the performances presented by visiting drama troupes, and at the age of fifteen, left his home to begin training at a Kathikali centre, some 25 km away. Later, he came to live in Kannur, and at the age of 31, he met his life partner, Janaki. After six years of marriage, the couple lost their first-born child, a girl. Janaki died a year later, leaving Nair to raise their one-year-old son.  Education Nair received Kathakali training under Gurus (teachers/mentors) Karunakara Menon, Ambu Panicker, Katathanad Ramunni Nair and Matasseri Kochugovindan Nair. He studied Bharatanatyamunder Kalamandalam Madhavan Nair, Salem Rajaratnam Pillai and Balachandra Bhai of Madras. Within the art of Kathakali, he was attracted to the Kallatikkotan of the Kaplingatan sampradayam and came to specialize in it.  Career and teaching  After many years as a performer, Nair eventually became a teacher of Kathakali.Nonetheless, he continued as a stage performer for selected roles including the Srikrishna Vesham in Santhanagopalam and several dance-dramas seen in India. He also choreographed various dance-dramas. He has said that the role of Krishna is his favorite.

Three others were said to have been injured when the gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on their car while travelling, with the victim Reham Yacoub inside. According to Al Jazeera, the three others injured were all women, although one of them died. Her murder showcased a serious major crackdown and growing violence against anti-government activists and protesters in Iraq. She was the second prominent activist from Basra to be assassinated after Tahseen Osama Al-Shahmani and was the third targeted attack by gunmen against anti-governmental activists in a week in Iraq. New waves of protests in Basra were staged by protesters in the wake of the murder of Reham.

History = Foundation  Cosin's library, centre right with flat roof, between the 19th-century university library, left, and Bishop Neville's 15th-century exchequer, right John Cosin, a monarchist who was then master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, went into exile in Paris during the English Civil War, where he became acquainted with the Bibliothèque Mazarine, one of the earliest public libraries. On the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Cosin returned to England, and shortly afterwards was appointed Bishop of Durham. In Durham, he began a programme of improvements around Palace Green, including building the library, one of the first public libraries in northern England, for the use of clergy and gentlemen of the diocese. It was constructed in 1667-8 by Cosin's Quaker architect, John Longstaffe, at a cost of £2500 (). Its initial collection consisted of over 5,000 books collected by Bishop Cosin, including his own collection previously stored at Peterhouse. These books included a copy of William Shakespeare's First Folio, which Cosin had probably bought new in 1623 and is the only copy to have remained in the same personal collection since it was first purchased. The original portrait panels located above the bookshelves were painted by Jan Baptist van Eerssell in 1668–1669. Further portraits hang in the library, including half portraits of English statesmen.  Durham University  Plaque on the library describing its history At its foundation in 1833, Durham University was granted use of the library, and received a donation of books from Bishop William Van Mildert as the founding collection of the Durham University Library. A gallery was constructed in Cosin's Library to accommodate this collection. The roof was raised, and the parapet also raised and altered from battlements to conceal the heightened roof. A two-story porch was added to the front of the library at this time to give access to the gallery. In the 1930s, the library came under the sole trusteeship of Durham University. In 1968 an extension was added to the University Library, designed by George Pace, and is called the Pace Library. In 1998, a group of manuscripts was stolen from the library, including Bishop Cosin's copy of the Shakespeare First Folio. The folio was recovered in 2008 after it was taken to the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC to be valued, though it had sustained damage from attempts to hide its provenance. It returned to display at the library in 2010. In October 2005, the collections in the library were included in the first group given Designated status by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council as having an \\"outstanding national and international significance\\". In 2019, the university received an £85,000 grant to catalogue and digitise the contents of the library.

Contents First published as Harris (then the San Francisco district attorney) was beginning her 2010 campaign for California Attorney General, the book outlines her vision of how the criminal justice system should function. She explains in detail why it is not enough to simply be tough on crime, and how prosecutors and lawmakers must also be smart and reform-minded in their approach. She argues such changes would increase public safety, reduce costs, and strengthen communities. Reception Children's Defense Fund president Marian Wright Edelman praised the book saying \\"Harris speaks from experience to debunk myths and offer real solutions to many of the problems with [our] current criminal justice system. Her suggestions have the potential to change and save lives.\\" In view of the police killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests, some critics have observed that Harris did not pay enough attention to race, instead attributing the problem of disparities in the system to class, and mentioning racial profiling from law enforcement only twice. In one passage, she dispels the notion that communities of color are inherently hostile towards the police saying, \\"There is a widely held notion that poor communities, particularly poor African-American and Latino communities, consider law enforcement the enemy and that they do not want police officers in their neighborhoods. In fact, the opposite is true. Both my experience and scientific surveys reflect this fact again and again. I can state categorically that economically poor people want and support law enforcement.\\" In response, Harris has stated that she is well aware of the racial biases in criminal justice and policing, citing her decision to become a prosecutor as an extension of the work her parents did during the civil rights movement. Those same critics have also noted that since being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016, Harris has become more assertive on issues such as prison reform, racial equality, and scrutinizing police practices.

It was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 818–820 in its catalogues. Plot In front of a shop, three mattress makers are busy sewing a mattress. When they go into a cheap wine bar for a break, a drunken tramp ambles onto the scene, and decides to take a nap inside the mattress. The workers come back and finish sewing up the mattress, not noticing the tramp sleeping inside it. Suddenly the tramp wakes up and tries to struggle out. Workers and passersby alike are startled to see what appears to be a living mattress tumbling and stumbling in the street. The tramp, still completely inside the mattress, makes his way into the nearby wine bar. In the ensuing confusion, all the customers and bar staff run out, and a policeman rushes in to arrest the living mattress. When he stumbles into the policeman, the tramp finally manages to tear his way out of the mattress. Bar, mattress, and furniture alike all end up on top of the policeman. In a final medium shot, preceded by a trilingual intertitle (\\"À Votre Santé, Good Health, Prosit!!!\\"), the tramp pours himself a drink and toasts the audience. Production The actors Manuel and Bruneval appear in the film as the tramp and the bald barman, respectively. The only special effect used is the substitution splice. The intertitle is lettered similarly to the title cards in two other films Méliès made that year, The Witch and Soap Bubbles. Méliès only rarely used titles within his films; in at least one example, the 1908 comedy French Cops Learning English, these took the form of placards held up within the film itself. The concluding medium shot is likewise a rare occurrence in Méliès's films, which are typically made up of long shots. He later used similar concluding shots in The Witch the same year, and How Bridget's Lover Escaped the following year.

During the Holocaust the Jewish population of the city was concentrated in the northern-district of the city, Baluty, where a Nazi ghetto was established. The community numbers a few hundreds and is headquartered at the Karol Gebhardt House located in 18 Pomorska Street in the city.Pałac Gebhardta przy Pomorskiej trafił do rejestru zabytków w Łodzi History Alte Szil Synagogue in Wolborska Street The beginnings of Jewish settlement in Łódź date back to the 18th century, the period of the fall of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The city did not have the de non tolerandis Judaeis privilege. The first known Jewish inhabitants of the city were Daniel Layzerowicz, a baker and Abram Lewkowicz, a tailor. They both lived in Łódź already in 1785. In 1791 Mosiek aka Mojżesz Pryntz from Lutomiersk settled here. The first wealthy and learned Jews living in Łódź were: Pinkus Zajdler, who came from Przedbórz in 1795, Pinkus Sonenberg, who came in 1797 from Łęczyca, and Lewek Heber, who came to Łódź in 1801 from Lutomiersk. They all played an important role, performing the functions of successive members of the Jewish community. The influx of Jewish people to the town was not large until the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. Out of a total of 190 inhabitants, only 11 were Jews. It was undoubtedly influenced by the character of the city; it was still the so-called a typical agricultural village, not very attractive to newcomers. The fact that Łódź was the property of the bishop until the Second Partition of Poland was also of great importance for the Jewish settlement; only in the period 1796–1798 it became a government city. Sukkot in the Jewish community center In the years 1818-1817 the Jews of Lodz constituted about a third of the city's inhabitants and most of them were poor. In 1825, German experts were invited to Łódź to help industrialize the city. The Germans signed a treaty called the \\"Zagirez Treaty\\" which included restrictions on the Jews. The Jews were required to live in the southern edges of the city, and move to the Jewish quarter within two years, except for two families who received permission to live in another part of the city. This area covered the southern side of the Old Market Square, Wolborska and Podrzeczna Streets up to the Łódka River. The area of the Jewish district was expanded several times: in 1841, the entire Old Town Square was included, Wolborska, Podrzeczna, and Drewnowska Streets, and in 1861, it was extended to the southern and western parts of Kościelny Square, Franciszkańska and Północna Streets.היסטוריה של הקהילה Hanukkah candles- lighting ceremony in Izrael Poznański Palace by Rabbi Dawid Szychowski Although this ban only applied to Zgierz, the authorities by establishing factory settlements: Nowe Miasto and Łódka, they followed suit on the Agreement of Zgierz, therefore settling here handicraftsmen, the vast majority of them Germans, decided that the ban Jewish settlement also includes this area. Reluctant to Jews the attitude of Łódź weavers and craftsmen decided that the first Jewish inhabitant of Nowe Miasto was only left at the end of 1833, Ludwik Mamroth, a wealthy merchant and component of Kalisz, which received permission from the government authorities to establish a yarn warehouse here. The next Jewish entrepreneurs who in the period until 1848 that were allowed to live in or set up a shop or yarn warehouse in Nowe Miasto were: Dawid Lande from Kalisz, Chaim Tykociner from Warsaw, Szmul Saltzman and Jakub Tyński. in total, until 1848, only 8 families lived there Jewish. The breakthrough came after the publication in September 1848 of the which definitely softened the limitations of the 1825 decree, between among others, it reduced by half the value of the property required from candidates wishing to live outside the district (previously PLN 20,000).Żydzi w Łodzi w latach zaborów 1793-1914, p. 18 In 1836, the Jews began to take an active part in the city's economy. In addition, this year educated Jews came to the city who fought for the dismantling of the ghetto and managed to live in the other part of the city as individuals in various tricks. In 1840 the authorities realized that the boundaries of the Jewish Quarter should be expanded as the number of Jewish residents in the city reached over 1350, but this plan was not approved. The Jews turned to the Russian commissioner and asked for official approval for \\"retrospective rights\\", the approval was given after 20 years when there were already about 5,500 Jews in the city. Despite the approval and expansion of the neighborhood, the place was still crowded and the municipality did not allow more Jews to settle in the city, expelling Jews who were not permanent. Synagogue in 18 Pomorska Street The end and the various restrictions on the Jews were in 1862 with the advent of the reform initiated by Prince Wielopowski, the liberal constitution - the emancipation of all the inhabitants of Poland and then the ghetto was also abolished and the Jews were released from the Treaty of Ziegler and the German Custodian. At the beginning of the reform, the Poles and Germans boycotted Jews who rented houses and evicted them from the common well, but later realized that cooperation with the Jews was economically viable for them. The Jews lived mainly in the center of Lodz, where there was also a Jewish character. The Jews who lived far from the center of Lodz were more involved with the Germans and Poles. After the ghetto was abolished, there was a great change among the Jews. The old wooden houses have disappeared and magnificent stone houses have been erected in their place. In addition the educated and merchants moved to more distant streets and established a branch trade. During this period there were wars between the old and the new between the educated and the Hasidim. In 1870 there were about 10,000 Jews in Lodz and in 1897 there were about 98,000 Jews. In 1809 the first synagogue was established and in 1811 land was purchased for the Jewish cemetery and thus the Jewish community of the city became an independent community independent of the communities around it. The Jews contributed greatly to the city's economy. First world war Great Synagogue in the city World War I caused a drastic decline in the number of Jews in Lodz, even before the Germans occupied the city. From the outbreak of World War I until the conquest of the city on December 6, 1914, about 50,000 Jews left the city. Their number dropped from 200,000 Jews on the eve of the war to less than 150,000. The Jews who fled the city for fear of being occupied by the Germans flowed east or into the surrounding villages. With the outbreak of the war, industrial production greatly diminished. There was a stagnation in trade and the financial market. The employment of the workers, and the Jewish workers among them, fell sharply. To deal with the famine, morbidity and mortality that were a result of the war, the community initiated mutual aid operations. With the help of the JDC, productive and consumer cooperatives were established and the activities of charities were expanded. Second Polish Republic Between the two world wars, the Łódź community was active not only in the field of education but also in the broader field of culture and various ideological movements: books were published in Hebrew and Yiddish, mainly in the fields of rabbinic literature, commentary and Hasidism, but also poetry and prose files. The most famous Lodz poet was Itzhak Katzenelson, who lived in Lodz from 1896 to 1939 when he escaped the city. He founded the Habima Hebrew Theater in Lodz. In 1939, with the outbreak of World War II, he fled to Warsaw. He devoted himself to literary activity in the Warsaw ghetto and even led a dramatic troupe in the ghetto. In 1943 he was sent to the Vital detention camp in France, and from there to Auschwitz, where he was murdered. In addition, daily newspapers, weekly magazines and periodicals in Yiddish and Hebrew appeared in Lodz. II World War and holocaustLodz Ghetto= Jews clean and repair coats salvaged at Chełmno for redistribution among Volksdeutsche in accordance with the top secret August Frank memorandum. The yellow badge was removed. The ghetto was officially demarcated on February 8, 1940, and was the first to be built by the Nazis and the last to be destroyed. Its area was less than 4 square kilometers, most streets had no sewers. To speed up the transition to the Nazi ghetto, a pogrom was carried out on March 1, during which many Jews were killed, and on April 30 the ghetto was closed to 164,000 Jews. The inhabitants of the ghetto suffered from hunger, and soon the inhabitants were left without means of subsistence, which led to demonstrations and riots, the situation improved somewhat after the establishment of production plants for the needs of Germany. In August 1942, 91 ghetto factories employed about 78,000 workers. About 15,000 people were sent to labor camps, only a few returned, and for many years there were periods when Germans brought remnants from various communities to the ghetto, which increased Residents suffered from famine, overcrowding and sanitation that caused epidemics, typhus and tuberculosis, and Rumkowski created a network designed to meet the needs of the population between 1940 and 1942, headed 7 hospitals, five pharmacies, an education department with 47 schools, a food department, a welfare department, nursing homes, dormitories, courts, and prisons, etc. Jewish police maintained order in the ghetto, but handed over deportations and recruitment to forced labor and even confiscated Jewish property, some opposed to Rumkowski. People's Republic of Poland Former office and apartment of Zew Wawa Morejno, 78 Zachodnia in Łódź Current office of the Jewish community board of Łódź in 18 Pomorska Street In the first years after World War II, when Warsaw had not yet been rebuilt from its ruins, Łódź actually served as the capital of Poland due to its central location in Poland and due to the fact that the city itself, compared to Warsaw, was not destroyed. Therefore, in 1945–1948, the Polish authorities and its central institutions were located in Łódź. For the same reason, the Jewish community in Łódź was extremely important in Poland, both quantitatively and organizationally and institutionally. Because of this challenge, the Łódź Jewish Committee was established. His main role was to rehabilitate the Sh'erit ha-Pletah, including housing, clothing, food, work, medical assistance, assistance in finding relatives and family reunification. The main source of aid was the JDC, which resumed operations in Poland in September 1946, and the TAZ. The ORT organization also resumed its operations in Poland at about the same time. The magnitude of the Holocaust, and the large number of Jews who arrived in Lodz within a few months after the Holocaust, presented the committee with many difficult tasks. The committee also worked in the field of children, almost all of whom were orphans. The activities of the orphanage were renewed, and efforts were made to remove Jewish orphans hidden in them during the Holocaust.Zakhor- קהילת לודז' After the Kielce pogrom, nearly half of the Jews of Łódź left Poland. The remaining Jewish community began to recover: a theater, two schools and about 20 newspapers and magazines in Yiddish, Hebrew and Polish began to operate. In the years 1956–1957, more Jews left the city, moving to Israel as part of the Gomulka Aliyah (). In 1969, following the 1968 anti-Jewish campaign, people of Jewish origin left Łódź again.

Publication history Between 1984 and 1987, Simon Forrest and Basil Barrett wrote a series of four fantasy role-playing adventures that were published by Integrated Games as The Complete Dungeon Master Series. The second adventure, published in 1985, was The Lost Shrine of Kasar-Khan, written by Forrest and Barrett, with interior art by Jon Baker, Selina Goodman, and Brendan Hickling, cartography by Justin Gregory and Allen Hickling, and cover art by Jez Goodwin. It was published by Integrated Games in 1985 as a boxed set containing * a 16-page booklet with a complete adventure * the book's cardstock cover also doubled as a gamemaster's screen * six sheets of color cardstock floor plans * four sheets of NPC statistics * four sheets of player handouts This scenario is the sequel to The Halls of the Dwarven Kings and precursor to The Watchers of the Sacred Flame and The Feathered Priests.

HAM. Accessed 21.08.2020.Leskinen, M. & J. Keronen. Secret Helsinki. Jonglez Publishing, 2019. The bronze and granite monument is situated in the Southern Helsinki Kamppi neighborhood on Lönnrotinkatu street, in small Lönnrot's Park. History In 1899 Emil Wikström won the contest held by the Finnish Literature Society to design a sculpture of the Finnish folklore collector Elias Lönnrot. The final version differed considerably from the original draft. It was influenced by the sculpture of Eemil Halonen, who held the second position in the contest. The monument was unveiled at night, October 18, 1902. The monument is currently the part of the Helsinki Art Museum collection. Description The monument depicts realistic figure of Lönnrot, writing down the songs, with two epic figures, Väinämöinen, hero-god from the national epic Kalevala, and mythic maiden Impi from the folklore collection Kanteletar. Väinämöinen rises from the mouth of a giant Antero Vipunen, carved on the right side of the granite pedestal. Antero Vipunen has a pentagram on the forehead, symbolizing his divine protection and magic power. Next to Lönnrot's name the front of the pedestal contains the words from Kalevala, poem 17: \\"Sain sanat salasta ilmi\\", which was translated by John Martin Crawford (1888) as \\"Hidden deep for many ages, learned the words of ancient wisdom\\". The context comes from the songs 16, 17 and 18 of the Finnish national epic Kalevala. Väinämöinen intends to obtain missing magic spells. A giant Antero Vipunen, buried with head emerging from the ground, swallows him. Väinämöinen fights to escape. Finally released from the mouth, Väinämöinen obtains new spells. The words on the pedestal refer to this event, as well as the collection work of Lönnrot.
