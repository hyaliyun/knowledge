His trip was sponsored by a Danish newspaper and made on the occasion of the 100th birthday of Jules Verne, a French author of adventure and science fiction. Palle Huld was chosen after having answered a newspaper advertisement; applicants had to be boys, 15 years old, able to manage in English and German and of good health. Like the characters in Jules Verne’s 1873 novel Around the World in 80 days he was only allowed to travel by land and sea, not by air. The travel (on first class) went from Denmark to Great Britain, across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada. From the American west coast he continued to Japan, China, Soviet Union, Poland, Germany and back to Denmark. He had to travel alone but was helped along the way by reporters of the newspaper, members of Danish embassies and local Boy Scouts. The travel was followed by not only Danish newspapers but newspapers around the world and on his return to Copenhagen he was met by a crowd of 20,000 people. He travelled towards the west, which was the fastest but also the opposite direction of the one taken in Around the World in 80 Days. Unlike the novel, he had little problems in reaching departures. In western Canada he met First Nations, who promised not to take his scalp, though red scalps were at a premium. He was impressed by the luxury of the Pacific Ocean liner; its restaurant was the size of the hall of a castle in his opinion and onboard he could play tennis and water polo. Around the world he was met by the press and he got increasingly better at handling them as the travel progressed. One question that gave him problems was about his taste in women; he told the journalist that he was too young to think of it. He was met with generosity, many accessories for his travel such as shoes and a camera were given to him for free. He declined one offer. On board the Pacific liner he would not let a young American woman darn his socks. Later, when he visited the famous Japanese Admiral Togo, he had to take his shoes off and thereby reveal the holes in his socks, which made him regret not taking the offer. Nevertheless, Japan was his favorite country since he found everything pretty. After his journey he was invited to, among others, Great Britain where he met with Baden-Powell founder of the boy Scout Movement and France where he laid flowers on the grave of Jules Verne. Legacy The book was translated into 11 languages and is said to have inspired Belgian cartoonist Hergé to create the comics Tintin. The theory that Palle Huld should be the inspiration for Tintin goes back to 1988 where it was proposed by Tintin collector Stéphane Steeman in an article titled Les Amis d’Hergé. He found striking resemblances between the pictures of Palle Huld's memoires and Hergé's early drawings of Tintin He was backed by Philippe Goddin, who found it likely that especially Tintin's staged reception at Brussels' north station in the guise of a 15-year-old Belgian Boy Scout, following the publication of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, was inspired by Palle Huld's reception in Copenhagen. It has not been possible to verify these claims by the papers left by Hergé, and Palle Huld himself had not heard of them when interviewed in 2009 on Tintin's 80 birthday. Palle Huld died in 2010 at the age of 98 years. On what would have been his 100th birthday in 2012 the Danish version was reprinted in his honor. Language editions *Czech: Kolem svêta za 44 dni...

Two were built. Design and development right The R.V was the Rieseler brother's first multiple passenger aircraft, a single engine parasol wing cabin design. The wing was in two parts, each with two wooden spars and ribs. Though the wings had quite thick, high lift airfoil sections, they were not cantilever structures and wing loads were transmitted to the fuselage via N form struts from the lower fuselage longerons to the wing spars, their outer, parallel members enclosed in fairings. A shallow steel tube cabane connected and supported the wings over the fuselage. They were fitted with high aspect ratio overhung balanced ailerons and had a deep cut- out in the trailing edge over the cockpit to enhance the pilot's forward and upward vision. The clean fuselage of the R.V was an internally wire braced, welded steel tube structure of rectangular cross section. The Mercedes D.I water-cooled six cylinder inline engine was mounted behind a rectangular nose radiator in an aluminium covered forward fuselage region; fuel was gravity fed from a wing tank. Aft, the fuselage was fabric covered. The pilot had an open cockpit under the wing trailing edge, with one passenger next to him. Two other passengers could sit, though not stand, side by side within the fuselage forward of the pilot in a cabin lit by windows, one in the small, starboard side door, and heated by hot air from the engine. Their luggage was placed in a small compartment behind the pilot. The empennage was a steel tube structure, fabric covered. The braced tailplane carried separate elevators which, like the rudder, were balanced. The R.V had a simple, fixed conventional undercarriage with steel tube V struts and mainwheels on a rubber sprung single axle, together with a tailskid. The R.V was flying before mid- January 1924. There were plans to accommodate all three passengers in the cabin. By February, their test pilot Raab had expressed strong concerns about the pilot's position, particularly the lack of visibility and his exposure to wind and pitching motions, suggesting that the relative positions of cockpit and cabin needed altering. This advice was heeded and in the second aircraft the cockpit had been moved forward, the cut-out in the trailing edge removed and the cabin placed under the trailing edge. In addition, the ailerons were no longer overhung and the vertical tail was broader and less high. This machine had a Daimler engine.

He was tall and performed with several groups from the early 1920s through the late 1940s, billed as the smallest man in the world. His small physique was often contrasted alongside larger circus sideshow acts, such as the juvenile obese and the excessively tall. Regarded as a \\"highly successful sideshow [novelty]\\" and celebrity, Howerton visited the White House and represented recruitment efforts of the United States Marine Corps. He was featured in multiple films, including a role as a Munchkin in 1939's The Wizard of Oz. He retired in 1949.

An expert said that he might have a \\"deranged ductless gland\\". Howerton's mother was just over tall, which led some to wonder if his small stature was inherited. At age six, Howerton was living in McCleary, Washington, with his parents and five brothers, Albert, Ernest, Forrest, LeRoy, and Charles. His father was employed at the time as a factory mechanic. Howerton never attended school, likely owing to his physical size and associated emotional consequences. In January 1926, Frank Howerton shot himself, having been in poor health previously. His mother subsequently married Robert Crawford. At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Howerton was living with Crawford and his mother in Manhattan. According to the census listing, Crawford was a \\"showman\\" while Howerton and his mother were identified as performers.Census entry for Robert Crawford, Helen Crawford, and Clarence Howerton.

Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Career Howerton's career began at a young age, when his father entered him into a local vaudeville show. In 1923, at the age of ten, Howerton joined the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, where he starred as a major attraction. The circus was the largest of the kind, with 800 performers and over 1000 animals. Although he was only ten years old, the circus sought to exaggerate his diminutive size by claiming that he was 18 years old. He was billed as the smallest man in the world, exhibited and known to the public under the name, \\"Major Mite\\". The \\"Major Mite\\" moniker had previously been used by an American comedian who died in 1900, and a 19th-century circus performer, William E. Jackson, who died in 1901, at 24, tall and weighing . Accompanied by his mother, Howerton spent 20 years with Ringling Brothers and also worked with the Cole Brothers Circus, the Coney Island Dreamland Side Show, and the World Circus Sideshow. In December 1922, Howerton received national press coverage when he visited U.S. President Warren G. Harding at the White House and was billed as \\"the world's smallest man.\\" One newspaper noted at the time: \\"The smallest midget and the smallest Shriner in the world, known as Major Mite, caused more excitement when he called at the White House recently than many a notable has done.\\" Howerton with the world's largest woman in 1922. In 1927, Howerton drew the attention of The New York Times when he led a \\"strange cavalcade\\" through the streets of Manhattan to the Hospital for Crippled and Ruptured Children. Howerton led the parade in the original coach that had previously been used by General Tom Thumb. The coach was drawn by two Shetland ponies, and Howerton was accompanied by \\"Tiny Doll\\", described as \\"the Major's sweetheart\\" and other circus performers. He also drew the attention of the Chicago Tribune when he visited Chicago in 1928. In 1928, Howerton was paired with an extraordinarily large circus sideshow performer known as \\"Tom Ton\\" and billed as the \\"Human Atom\\" and \\"Big Baby Elephant.\\" Howerton is said to have performed with numerous human oddities, also working with Ruth Pontico, a woman weighing , in his career. In advertising and film, Howerton found success beyond the sideshow. During the 1930s, he was used as a mascot for the recruitment side of the United States Marine Corps. His biggest role in acting was with 1939's The Wizard of Oz, in which he played the part of a trumpet-playing Munchkin, Herald #3, who announced the arrival of the mayor. He was one of the smallest Munchkins in Oz. Howerton also appeared in the 1932 Our Gang comedy \\"Free Eats\\". By 1940, he was living with his mother in Manhattan. His occupation was described as \\"exhibitionist\\" in a circus, but a 1941 document states that he registered with \\"Clackamas County Local Board No. 2\\", located in Estacada, Oregon; his registration prompted the Board to state: \\"We believe we have the smallest registrant in the United States\\". In the announcement of his registration, his weight and height are given, vastly contrasting to other sources: a height of and a weight of . His last performance was for Cole Bros. in 1948. Reputation Howerton was often seen with other human oddities; for example, in 1924, he was photographed with Martin Feig, a four-year-old boy who weighed 104 pounds. Feig reportedly said to Howerton, \\"Aw, you're nothing but a germ-weight midget.\\" One newspaper referred to Howerton, who was in reality only 13 years old at the time, as \\"the Beau Brummel of the side shows\\", noting that the Doll sisters (two female small persons working with Ringling Brothers) declared him \\"a regular sheik\\". In contrast to his public persona, Howerton reportedly enjoyed cigars and beer, \\"often yelled obscenities\\", and was known to \\"run the length of a bar, kicking anything in his way\\", sometimes whilst dressed in children's clothes. While working with Ringling Brothers, Howerton befriended Jack Earle, who was tall, but at the time was advertised as being . The two were often photographed together in promotional materials for Ringling Brothers, with it being said that \\"it is penny-ante poker which has made pals of Jack and the major\\". = Size = Reports of Howerton's size range vastly; the upper boundary for both height and weight is given by the United States Selective Service System, who report a height of and a weight of . A height of is given in several more modern sources, including Ripley's Believe It or Not!: Howerton himself claimed that was his height at 22, and that his weight was The Chicago Tribune gave his height as and his weight as . At 18, it was reported that he weighed . Post entertainment industry and death Howerton retired from the entertainment industry in 1949 at the age of 35. By 1970 he had moved back to Oregon and was living with a niece in the small town of Dayton. His diminutive size meant that he didn't pay welfare to the state, as it was \\"never collected from \\"children\\" less than tall\\". His size, however, meant that he was forced to have tailor-made clothing, which he \\"demand[ed be] good standard\\". On November 18, 1975, at the age of 62, Howerton died of pneumonia in a hospital in McMinnville, Oregon. He was buried in Mountainview Cemetery in nearby Oregon City.

It is described by Marathis as a sport with a Marathi ethos. Efforts to popularise the sport Langdi is considered to be useful in training for sports like kho kho, volleyball and gymnastics. The National Langdi Federation received national recognition in 2010. Langdi in Maharashtra is a popular childhood pastime, it is described as the foundation of all sports. Suresh Gandhi, Secretary of Langdi Federation of India acknowledges playing langdi isn't financially rewarding. Stake holders have to arrange for funds out of their own resources. Mumbai University will be the first Indian university to introduce langdi at the college level, for female students thus revitalising the traditional sport. 5 lakh female students study in the university in 700 colleges affiliated to it. C. N. Vidyamandir, a school in Ahmedabad, encourages participation in traditional sports such as langdi as these cost less money to play and are mentally and physically refreshing for children addicted to the electronic media and games.

This recognition results in facilities like concessional railway travel being made available, thus ensuring in growth of the sport. Expatriate Indians have associated in the effort to popularise langdi in other countries, such as Thailand. Video films of the sport being played have been prepared in order raise interest internationally. Brief Rules The rules of this sport have been standardised by the Akhil Maharashtra Sharirik Shikshan Mandal. Langdi is a team sport between two sides, played 12 players a side, and an additional three extra players. A match lasts 36 minutes. It is played in four innings of nine minutes each.

In Japan, a national debate about the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion resulted in widespread coverage of the show's endings and its retellings, contributing to the interest in academic analysis of the show. Most of the franchise features an apocalyptic mecha action story, which revolves around the efforts by the paramilitary organization NERV to fight hostile beings called Angels, using giant humanoids called Evangelions that are piloted by select teenagers. The psychological, religious, and philosophical themes explored in the work represent the majority of the discussion. Evangelion's influence in postmodern apocalyptic narratives on the \\"sekaikei\\" genre has been great, but it remains the most successful example. Psychoanalysis Evangelion has long been taken as a deeply personal expression of Hideaki Anno's personal struggles\\"Whereas Yamaga Hiroyuki last year said that Honneamise reflected his opinion of the world at the time he wrote and directed it, Anno Hideaki declared in last November's issue of Newtype that he's going only by his own value system in judging the series. That, combined with Anno's surprise remarks at the end of vol. 1 of \\"Eva\\" character designer Sadamoto Yoshiyuki's Evangelion manga (itself a similar, but \\"alternate\\" version of the anime story) that this project represents the end of four years that were for him no more than \\"simply not dying,\\" indicate this anime television series is personal and deeply felt to Anno.\\" \\"Overriding it all, as the noted Japanese social writer, Sato Kenji, has remarked, is Anno Hideaki's overall honesty, his own whisper of the heart—\\"to live is to change\\"—from one of Japan's top animators, caught for four years in the personal hell of depression and helplessness as an artist. It helps to remind one that the people who make anime don't do it just for the often paltry living it provides, but to express what's inside them with these tools they know. To make something that means something to them is the reason Gainax makes everything. \\"Arrogant and selfish\\" is how Anno describes it.\\" \\"Speaking Once as They Return: Gainax's Neon Genesis Evangelion\\"]; Carl Horn, AMPlus 1.2 1996 and his long battle with depression. From the start, Evangelion invokes many psychological themes. Phrases used in episodes, their titles, and the names of the background music frequently derive from Sigmund Freud's works,\\"Aside from Old Testament quotes, there are numerous cases in Evangelion of far-reaching references to such Freudian concepts as the Libido and death wish…\\", \\"Going off on a tangent, the choice of theme songs, \\"Thanatos—If I can't be yours\\" and \\"Come Sweet Death\\" both illustrate the importance of the death wish to the movie.\\" pg 147, 150 of Fujie 2004 in addition to perhaps some Lacanian influences in general.\\"In the final episode, Anno is clearly referencing Freud and perhaps Lacan as the unseen voice inside Shinji's head explains to him that he creates his personality first through disassociating with the mother and then through distinguishing himself from others.\\" pg 434 of Napier 2002 Examples include \\"Thanatos\\", \\"Oral stage\\", \\"Separation Anxiety\\", and \\"Mother Is the First Other\\" (the basis of the Oedipus complex is that the mother is the first object of the child's love). The scenery and buildings in Tokyo-3 often seem laden with psychological import, even in the first episode.\\"Shinji and Misato's descent into the seemingly bottomless depths of Nerv headquarters can be read, as critic Endo Toru suggests, as a descent into the unconsciousness, metonymically reinforced by the profusion of downward escalators and elevators from which the protagonists emerge into a disorienting maze of long empty corridors and bizarre machinery (84). It is surely no coincidence that, in the first episode, Misato and Shinji enter Nerv only to become hopelessly lost, a situation that recurs symbolically and concretely throughout the series until the final episode explicitly displays Shinji as \\"lost\\" in his own subconscious.\\" pg 428 of Napier 2002 Many of the characters have deep psychological traumas in relation to their parents. Shinji's introversion and social anxiety stem from the death of his mother at an early age and his abandonment by his father. Asuka was the target of her mother's insanity, and discovered her mother's body after she hanged herself; her tough, bullying personality is a means of distracting herself from her pain, and she has made piloting Unit 02 her only source of pride and satisfaction. Misato's father neglected her when she was a child; after he was killed in the Second Impact, she stopped talking for a couple of years. In episode 25, Misato states that she was both attracted to and afraid of Ryoji Kaji because he reminded her of her father. Similarly, many scenes overlap images of Shinji's mother with images of his potential lovers, both lining up with Freudian theories. Ritsuko saw her mother having an affair with Gendo Ikari; after her mother's suicide she felt both attraction and hate towards Gendo. Indeed, the last two episodes are \\"stripped of the high-tech gadgetry and the colorful visuals that characterize the earlier episodes in the series, these last two episodes take place largely in muted tones… a form of interrogation proceeds to be carried out as he [Shinji] asks himself—or is asked by an unseen voice—probing psychological questions.\\"pg 426 of Napier 2002 The questions elicit unexpected answers, particularly the ones dealing with Shinji's motivation for piloting the Eva—he feels worthless and afraid of others (especially his father) if he is not piloting the Eva.\\"At first he insists that he does so to \\"save mankind.\\" But when that answer is met with the response \\"Liar\\", he shifts to a more complex self-analysis… he admits to piloting the Eva because of his own need for the liking and respect of others, and finally acknowledges that he feels \\"worthless\\" unless he is joined with the Eva.\\" pg 426 of Napier 2002 Asuka and Rei are also depicted in deep introspection and consideration of their psyches. Asuka comes to the realization that her entire being is caught up in being a competent Eva pilot and that without it, she has no personal identity: \\"I'm the junk… I'm worthless. Nobody needs a pilot who can't control her own Eva.\\"As quoted in pg 426 of Napier 2002 Rei, who throughout the series has displayed minimal emotion, reveals that she does have one impulse; it is Thanatos, an inclination to death: \\"I am Happy. Because I want to die, I want to despair, I want to return to nothing.\\" In episode 25 Shinji and Asuka both show that they in fact suffered similar pasts and found different ways of dealing with it. This is further established in Shinji when he claims he has no life without Eva and this is disproven by the world shown in episode 26 followed by the famous \\"Congratulations\\" scene. Religion The most prominent symbolism takes its inspiration from Christian sources and frequently uses iconography and themes from Christianity, Islam, Gnosticism,\\"Alongside the effort put into the combat scenes, Evangelion also attempts to convincingly portray the psychic struggles in which the characters engage. These struggles are both wide-ranging and emotionally draining. They are also presented with psychoanalytical sophistication as the characters try to come to grips with their own inner turmoil, their problematic relations with each other, and their relation to more remote forms of Otherness—the gigantic machines that are the EVAs and with which they must synchronize, and the enigmatic Angels who present a riddle that is increasingly depicted in terms of what seems to be a Christian or perhaps Gnostic notion of apocalypse.\\" pg 425 of Napier 2002 and Kabbalism, in the series's examination of religious ideas and themes. Anno suggested a grand theme with the work including the nature of evolution, the existence of God and its impact on humanity.\\"Anno says the new offering from Gainax will consider some of the ultimate questions posed by science fiction, and, indeed, philosophy, such as: What is the nature of evolution? What is humanity's relationship to his or her God? Does god, in fact, exist? What does it mean for the human race if that question can be answered definitively?\\" From \\"Gainax Returns to Anime with Shinseiki Evangelion\\", published in the February 1995 edition of Animerica, and as quoted in Neon Genesis Evangelion, volume 10. Assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki said that they originally used Christian symbolism and themes only to give the project a unique edge against other giant robot shows, that there is no Christian meaning to the series\\"There are a lot of giant robot shows in Japan, and we did want our story to have a religious theme to help distinguish us. Because Christianity is an uncommon religion in Japan we thought it would be mysterious. None of the staff who worked on Eva are Christians. There is no actual Christian meaning to the show, we just thought the visual symbols of Christianity look cool. If we had known the show would get distributed in the US and Europe we might have rethought that choice.\\" ― Kazuya Tsurumaki EvaOtaku.com FAQ; see also an interview with Tsurumaki which contains the same quote (Archive link) and that it was not meant to be controversial (although it was\\"There are a lot of biblical references in Blue Exorcist; after the controversy surrounding Neon Genesis Evangelion, were you at all hesitant to include these references?\\" Interview: Blue Exorcist mangaka Kazue Kato\\"). Anno has said that Eva is susceptible to multiple interpretations.\\"Evangelion is like a puzzle, you know. Any person can see it and give his/her own answer. In other words, we're offering viewers to think by themselves, so that each person can imagine his/her own world. We will never offer the answers, even in the theatrical version. As for any Evangelion viewers, they may expect us to provide the 'all-about Eva' manuals, but there is no such thing. Don't expect to get answers by someone. Don't expect to be catered to all the time. We all have to find our own answers.\\" from Hideaki Anno's Anime Expo '96 interview, pp20–3 in the November 1996 Newtype, as translated by Miyako Graham in issue 43, pages 40–41 of Protoculture Addicts and as quoted by Lawrence Eng Hiroki Sato, head of Gainax's PR department, has made similar statements,\\"But Hiroki Sato, 32, head of the public relations department of GAINAX, the company that produced the animation, says various devices included in Evangelion are only elements of the product and are not directly linked to its theme. 'Anno made a soul-searching journey in producing Evangelion by including his daily sufferings and thinking about them,' Sato says.\\" Japan Economic Newswire, 8 May 1997, 'Cartoon 'Eva' captures sense of void among Japanese youth' as has Toshio Okada.\\"Mr. Anno (\\"Evangelion\\") apparently never read the Bible, despite the heavy Christian symbology of his work; he just (according to Mr. Okada) picked out a few interesting technical terms. Likewise, the anime creation staff might open a book on psychology and, rather than read it thoroughly, simply go through it picking out \\"great technical terms\\" to use in the anime!\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20080504115217/http://www.mit.edu/people/rei/manga- okadaluncheon.html The \\"Angels\\" are a reference to the angels of God from the Old Testament, most of which bear the same names. In 1993, the Evangelion proposal presented the angels, including names and appearances. The most important angels are Adam and Lilith. The first Angel is named Adam, just as the biblical Adam is the first man created by God. The second Angel is named Lilith, a reference to the Jewish folklore in which Lilith is the first wife of Adam. Lilith is shown crucified and impaled with a spear named the \\"Lance of Longinus\\", the same lance used to pierce the side of Jesus Christ during his crucifixion, according to the Gospel of Nicodemus. Eve or Eva comes from Adam's rib; similarly, the Evangelions come from the Angel first identified as Adam.In episode 23,Tear/Rei III, Ritsuko states that \\"These are dummies. And nothing but parts for Rei. Humans found a god, and thus, tried to obtain it. As a result, humanity was punished. That was 15 years ago. The god that they found vanished. However, they tried to revive the god themselves. It was Adam. A human was made from Adam to be close to the god. That is Eva.\\" See also Fujie 2004: \\"Elsewhere, we learn, \\"That which was born of Adam is the Eva\\", effectively proving that Adam was the model for the Evangelions.\\" (pg 48). The goal of the Angels are to return to Adam and create the Third Impact which would destroy mankind, Kaworu Nagisa recognizes humanity as beings of Lilith and identifies them as Lilum.Neon Genesis Evangelion Episode 24 Several times throughout the series, the defeat of an Angel results in a Christian cross shaped explosion. The Magi supercomputers of NERV are named Melchior, Balthasar and Caspar after the names traditionally given for the Magi who were mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew as having visited Jesus Christ in Bethlehem.pg 60 of Fujie 2004 The Marduk Institute is a front organization for Nerv, tasked with finding the teenagers suitable for piloting Evangelion units. Marduk was the name of the chief Babylonian deity and patron god of the city of Babylon. The Tree of Sephiroth (Tree of Life) is mentioned, as well as shown in the opening title sequence and in Gendo's office, with Hebrew inscriptions on it (the terms written there are mostly Kabbalic). It also appears in The End of Evangelion during Seele's version of Instrumentality.Broderick, Mick. \\"Anime's Apocalypse: Neon Genesis Evangelion as Millenarian Mecha\\". Intersections 7, 2002.

It is a new myth of origin, complete with its own deluge, Armageddon, apocalypse and transcendence.\\" Other analysts bring additional views that include a combination of religious and psychological themes, where Kraemer's views diverge from Broderick's, but affirm several themes including Shinji as a messiah figure. Philosophy Themes of individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility are heavily relied upon throughout the entire series, particularly through the philosophies of Søren Kierkegaard. Episode 16's title is a reference to Kierkegaard's book, \\"The Sickness Unto Death\\". \\"The sickness unto death\\" refers to \\"despair\\", and in the introduction of this work, Kierkegaard says that, \\"Even death itself is not 'the sickness unto death'. Not to mention any of the suffering on Earth known as destitution, illness, misery, privations, misfortune, pain, anguish, grief, or regret.\\"Platinum Edition Booklets, ADV, 2004-2005. The Human Instrumentality Project may be inspired by the philosophy developed by Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Alt URL while some existentialist ideas appearing in the work could also be found in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness and Martin Heidegger's Being and Time. The title of Episode 4, \\"The Hedgehog's Dilemma\\", is a reference to the Hedgehog's dilemma, Arthur Schopenhauer's analogy about the challenges of human intimacy. Other views Orbaugh notes that \\"the young protagonists incarnate monstrosity/hybridity in several ways simultaneously\\", highlighting their cyborgization with the Evangelions and the \\"Angel\\" DNA which allows their synchronization, with additional hybridity for the mixed race Asuka and the cloned Rei.Orbaugh, Sharalyn. The Genealogy of the cyborg in Japanese popular culture. In World weavers: globalization, science fiction, and the cybernetic revolution, ed. Wong Kin Yuen, G. Westfahl, and A. Kit-Sze Chan. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press. 2005. Pages 55-72. Shinji's integration with the Evangelion presents a unique concept of \\"inter-corporation\\", where Shinji and the Evangelion penetrate and fill each other, which is further expressed by the analogous sexual intercourse taking place, with the male Shinji taking a female role. Combined with the resulting and literal Oedipal complex, the act raises questions about gender and sexual identity. In another discussion, Orbaugh highlights that the inter-corporation of a female allows for the weapons to defeat the Angels and that the male terror of being radically feminized, inter-penetrated and inter-corporated, shows the need to embrace the \\"abject femininity—permeability/penetrability—that is repressed in techno-patriarchal society.\\" Yoshiyuki Sadamoto has described the feminine character design for Shinji, describing how he was initially essentially a male version of Nadia from Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water., and how his relationship with Asuka was modeled on Nadia's own relationship with Jean, Nadia's love interest and eventual husband in the series.

A train at the station can be seen on the left. The square building on the right is the Armory. The Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station, also known as Pennsylvania Railroad Station, was a railroad station that was owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad and operated by the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C., from July 2, 1872 until its closure in 1907. It was located at the southern corner of 6th street NW and B Street NW (now Constitution Avenue), now the site of the West Building of the National Gallery of Art. It was in this train station that United States President James A. Garfield was assassinated by Charles Guiteau. Description The main building of the station had a 120-foot frontage on B Street NW and a 90-foot frontage on 6th Street. It was in Victorian Gothic style, 55 feet high, of pressed red brick with black mortar and belt courses of Ohio free stone. There were three towers covered with elaborate roofs of red, blue and green slate and decorated with ornamental iron, including a 100-foot clock tower on the corner. The lower level housed waiting rooms, baggage rooms, and ticket offices, with offices above. More land was purchased on Virginia Avenue to house locomotives. An iron train shed south of the terminal building was erected on screw piles. It was 600 feet long and 120 feet wide and had 25-foot decorated iron columns supporting an arched roof approximately 50 feet high at its crown. The arch was decorated with an eagle and the sides with ornamental figures. The building was lighted from above and the lower part opposite the government grounds was faced with ornamental scroll work. Tracks ran south from the station along 6th Street to a wye junction at Sixth Street SW, Maryland Avenue SW, and Virginia Avenue SW. Ironically, the tracks along Maryland Avenue ran over the Long Bridge to Virginia, and the tracks along Virginia Avenue went east into Maryland (Landover Subdivision). History =Approval in Congress= The Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, opened on July 2, 1872, operated between Baltimore and Washington, where it initially erected a temporary wooden-framed station building. On April 1, 1872, by a vote of 115 ayes and 55 nays the House of Representatives passed a bill that allowed the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad) to build a depot on the lot at the corner of 6th Street NW and B Street NW, just north of the Armory. The bill had been filibustered for some time by opponents. On May 21, 1872, An Act to confirm the Action of the Board of Aldermen and Common Council of the City of Washington, designating a Depot Site for the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Company, and for other Purposes was ratified.42nd Congress Session II. C. 189 - May 21, 1872. The paragraph pertaining to the depot itself reads: > Beginning at the southwest corner of Sixth Street and B street north, > running west one hundred and fifty feet along B street; thence south eight > hundred and two feet to the present line of the canal; thence east one > hundred and fifty feet to the line of Sixth Street; thence north by line of > Sixth Street to the place of beginning; and the said company shall, so far > as the United States can so provide, have the right to hold, use, and occupy > may use the said grounds for the purpose of constructing thereon a passenger > depot, to be used by the said company for passenger and express-freight > traffic, and for no other purposes. =Construction= Preparation of the site began before the bill passed. It was located one block from the city's largest market, Center Market, which opened a few months later the same year. Temporary platforms were erected, and construction crews started preparing to lay track up Sixth Street. The station was designed by Joseph M. Wilson, architect and principal assistant engineer of the construction department of the Pennsylvania Railroad; the engineer in charge was Joseph Wood. The site presented problems since it was a former marsh, the bed of Tiber Creek; the station was built over the old Washington City Canal. A foundation of five feet of Ohio freestone was laid over pilings driven ten feet deep. The new station opened in 1873. Construction was completed on July 16, 1874, and a celebration with a collection for the workmen was held at Platz's Saloon. =James Garfield assassination= Contemporary illustration of the assassination Memorial marker in the station with gold star on the floor On July 2, 1881, it was announced in the local newspapers that United States President James A. Garfield would be leaving for his summer vacation. En route to board a train to New Jersey, he was shot in the back by assassin Charles Guiteau while walking across the lobby of the Baltimore and Potomac station with James G. Blaine. While the president survived the initial shooting, doctors subsequently probed his wounds with non-sterilized objects in a frantic search for the bullet. The bacterial infections they introduced to the wound were the likely cause of his eventual death in September. A marker was placed on the train station wall after the death of the President, and a gold star was placed on the floor to mark the spot. The marker and the star were lost when the station was razed in 1908. Garfield Circle with the James A. Garfield Monument is located six blocks southeast of where he was shot. The monument was unveiled on May 12, 1887, while the station was still active and the assassination still in the local memory.\\"James Garfield Monument, (sculpture)\\". SIRIS On March 2, 2019 the National Park Service erected exhibit panels to mark site of the assassination. =Closure and demolition= In 1907, both the New Jersey Avenue Station and the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station shut down to relocate to the newly built Union Station. The B&O; Railway decided to start running trains from Union Station as of October 26, 1907, while the Pennsylvania Railway set itself a deadline of November 16, 1907. On March 15, 1908, the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railway Company released its rights to the station at 6th Street NW and B Street NW to the United States government for $1,500,000. According to a local newspaper, the station was demolished by order of President Theodore Roosevelt before December 17, 1908, without authority or notice to the public. =Site= By 1914, the site had become the designated location for the George Washington Memorial Association's George Washington Victory Memorial Building. On November 14, 1921, a ceremony took place to lay the cornerstone for the new building. However, the building never materialized and in 1937, it was decided to use the site for the National Gallery of Art. Construction on the foundation started that year. On August 21, 1937, The Washington Post' reported that the cornerstone had been dug up. A small metal box had been found inside and handed to David E. Finley, trustee for the Gallery of Art. It was passed on to A. K. Shipe, former attorney of the ill-fated project. A large gold star was found in the box; this was believed at the time to be the gold star from the train station marking the spot where President Garfield had been shot. The West Building of the National Gallery of Art on the National Mall was completed on the site and was accepted on behalf of the American people by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 17, 1941.

It is the opening track of the band's eighth studio album Oceania, released on June 19, 2012. The song was written and produced by the band's frontman Billy Corgan and was co-produced by Bjorn Thorsrud. Music and lyrics \\"Quasar\\" features the use of wall of sound and delay effects along with a drop-D tuned guitar work. Lyrically, the song deals with spiritual themes. A central theme throughout the lyrics is the search for \\"God\\", or faith. This search for God and spiritual truth or direction is conveyed in lyrics such as \\"Fated One, hold me down... ...Do I know you?\\" As well, the song shows the vast diversity of Billy Corgan's spirituality, referencing the Christian God, the disciple Mark, the Hindu God Krishna, and referring to the ineffable name of God used in the Hebrew Bible. Ironically, all of these references appear in the same verse; \\"God, right on!/Krishna, right on!/Mark, right on!/Yod He Va He Om!\\", with \\"Yod He Va He\\" referring to the Hebrew letters which represent the ineffable name; YHVH. Critical reception \\"Quasar\\" received mostly positive reviews.

The programme aims to teach entrepreneurs, mostly in developing countries, fundamental business skills thus they can operate their businesses successfully. The term Micro-MBA refers to the traditional Master of Business Administration (MBA) programme. There is no official definition for the term Micro-MBA. The course programme focuses on teaching theory about subjects as money management, stock control, customer handling, and marketing that can be applied in the daily business activities of the business owners. Objective The main aim of the Micro-MBA programme is to provide small business owners with basic business skills, which they can apply in their daily activities to grow and sustain their businesses. Furthermore, it is supposed to empower them to become self- employed. History The Trident Institute offered the first Micro-MBA programme in 1988 and it was aimed at business owners who had limited access to further education in South Africa. The programme focuses on teaching students basic business skills in class and mentoring sessions after completing the classes at their marketplaces. The main aim of the course has been to enable small business owners to operate their businesses more successfully or to start their own business. Since its formation more than 160,000 people have successfully completed the Micro-MBA course, which has been offered by some 250 organisations who have had their trainers trained by Trident Institute. Different surveys have shown that between 67% and 81% of former programme students are still successful with their own business or participating in the labour market 18 months after completing the course.Wikiversity:Micro-MBA project The programme has become a successful education tool in basic economic development in South Africa and has spread to other African and Asian countries. The course has been described by the London Financial Times as \\"Brilliantly Simple and Simply Brilliant!\\". The founder and CEO of Trident Institute, Cedric Buffler, won the award for Outstanding Social Entrepreneur for 2007 by the Schwab Foundation. The Micro-MBA has not only spread from South Africa to neighbouring African countries (Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria) but also to Asia and South America. Characteristic of these markets is that poor people with small businesses do not have access to supportive business theory and knowledge. Admission criteria Most organizations that offer Micro-MBA are founded or sponsored by Nonprofit Organizations. Admissions criteria vary. But mostly it is generally required that participants already have an existing business or a business idea that they want to realize after the course. No specific academic qualifications are required. The most important requirements are high motivation levels and the will to apply the learning to their businesses. Interviews are conducted before choosing applicants to guarantee that they take the opportunity serious. Most of the courses are free of charge but this depends on the programme, course design, and the organization. Course design and structure Micro-MBA is an outcomes-based, learner-driven course. The classroom learning takes about 35 hours to complete and this is followed by a period of mentoring. This varies, depending on the requirements set by the implementing organisation. The duration of the courses varies from three weeks of classes combined with nine months of mentoring training to three months of classes with additional mentoring training. Facilitators are trained by Trident Institute and are typically business owners or trainers employed by community-based organisations. Mentoring and coaching, in terms of visiting students at their marketplace, after the course, ensures the long-term success of the programme. The course materials are simple as e.g. workbooks and calculators. The course comprises 8 simple workbooks, which are accessible to persons with a grade 6 level of literacy: * Market Investigation * Business calculations on a simple calculator * Buying * Costing and Pricing * Selling * Money Management * Stock Control Workbooks and bookkeeping materials are available in three variants, for Traders, Producers and Service \`providers.

It included most of the Iğdır Province of present-day Turkey. As part of Russian Transcaucasia, Surmali was significant as the location of Mount Ararat and the salt mines of Kulp (modern Tuzluca). Its administrative center was Igdyr. Etymology \\"Surmali\\" derives from the name of the old Armenian city of \\"Surmari\\" which evolved from \\"Surb Mari\\" ( \\"Saint Mary\\"). The castle of Surmari still stands today in the village of Sürmeli on the Armenian border in the Tuzluca district of Turkey's Iğdır Province. History A part of Persia's Erivan Khanate, Surmali was annexed by the Russian Empire in the Treaty of Turkmenchay in the aftermath of the Russo-Persian War of 1826–28. The district was first administered as part of the Armenian Oblast and then the Erivan Governorate.Tsutsiev, pp. 16, 19, and 21.

He was succeeded by his son, Varaztirots. Life Smbat was the son of Manuel Bagratuni. He is first mentioned some time in the 580s, when the Byzantine emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) requested the Armenian nobles to raise cavalry for service in his wars against the Avars. Smbat and Sahak Mamikonian led a thousand-strong unit each to Constantinople, where they were richly rewarded and sent home. Sebeos also adds that Maurice supposedly adopted Smbat at this occasion. In 589, however, Smbat led a rebellion against the Byzantines, was captured and sent to Constantinople, where he was condemned to death and was thrown to be devoured by the beasts in the Hippodrome of Constantinople. He was pardoned at the last minute by Maurice, who then banished him to some \\"distant islands\\" and later to Africa. Smbat returned from exile some time after, and entered the service of the Sasanian shah Khosrow II, who in 595 appointed him marzban (military governor) of Hyrcania (the southern coastlands of the Caspian Sea). Smbat served in this post until 602, but was initially employed in suppressing the rebellion of Vistahm in Khorasan, before being recalled to reside at the royal court in Ctesiphon. There he received further honours, and was also appointed Lesser Minister of Finance. In ca. 607 (\\"the eighteenth year of Khosrow's reign\\") he was sent back to Armenia with extensive powers as \\"Commander of the army of the lords of houses\\". His tenure in Armenia was short but productive: as N. Garsoian writes, \\"Smbat’s extraordinary powers allowed him to reaffirm the authority of the Persian crown in Persarmenia, to restore the prestige of the weakened Armenian Church by summoning a council that elected a new katholikos, Abraham I, after a vacancy of three years, and to rebuild the cathedral of the Armenian administrative capital of Duin, overriding the objections of the local Persian authorities\\". In the next year, Smbat received the honorific title Khosrow Shun (\\"the Joy or Satisfaction of Khosrow\\"), and about this time led a campaign on behalf of Khosrow against the Hephthalites, whom he defeated, possibly killing their king in single combat. After that, he retired to the royal court, where he lived amidst the honours accorded to him by Khosrow until his death in 616/7. He was succeeded by his son, Varaztirots.

The County of Saarwerden (; ) was a county located in Lorraine, within the Holy Roman Empire. Its capital was in (situated on the right side of the Saar) and later in New Saarwerden or Ville Neuve de Sarrewerden (on the left side of the Saar), both in the present city of Sarre-Union. Today, the area of the county belongs to Bas-Rhin, Alsace. History Archbishop Friedrich III, laid to rest in Cologne Cathedral. In 1047, Emperor Heinrich III of the Holy Roman Empire established the Duchy of Lorraine from the former Duchy of Upper Lorraine. During the troubles that agitated the duchy, some lords rebelled and became more or less, independent of the Duke. Saarwerden branched from the Bishopric of Metz, when lord Friedrich, son of Godfrey I of Blieskastel separated and formed the County of Saarwerden. Thus the County was created under the House of Saarwerden in 1111. Friedrich built a castle in Sarrwerden upon the ruins of an ancient Roman bath. He and his wife Gertrude also founded the Abbey Wörschweiler in 1130. The most famous representative of this family was Friedrich III. He was Archbishop of Cologne from 1370–1414. On the death of his childless brother Heinrich II, the last Count of Saarwerden, in 1397, Friedrich temporarily directed the County before ceding the government to his stepbrother, Friedrich III, Count of Moers. Now the County was in personal union under Friedrich as the County of Moers-Saarwerden. In 1417, the County of Saarwerden branched off once more as the inheritance of his son, Johann. The House of Moers-Saarwerden died to the House of Nassau and County of Saarbrücken in 1527; through jure uxoris, Johann Ludwig of Nassau-Saarbrücken inherited the lands of his wife, Countess Katharina I. =The Reformation= The County was passed into the House of Nassau. Count Johann Ludwig attempted to usurp the authority of the Bishopric of Metz in the County by dissolving the Benedictine Abbey in 1554. After the Abbey was demolished in 1557, The Bishopric of Metz was annexed into France, and the land passed to Lorraine. Old property disputes with Lorraine were a subject of contention during this time. The Calvinist County of Saarwerden surrounded by Catholic Lorraine. Count Adolf introduced the Reformation into Saarwerden in 1556. He allowed Protestant refugees fleeing religious persecution in the Kingdom of France and the Duchy of Lorraine. He approved the settlement of what became known as 'Seven Gallic Villages': Altwiller, Burbach, Diedendorf, Eywiller, Gœrlingen, Kirrberg, and Rauwiller. Thus, the County was populated with Calvinists who spoke French, while the rest of the County were Lutheran Germans. The County of Saarwerden become an experimental model of peace between Lutherans and Calvinists. Since Adolf died childless, the County fell back to his Catholic brother, Johann V. Johann did not persecute the Protestants, however. There was much contention between the Catholic Lorraine and the newly Protestant Saarwerden. When Protestant Philip II inherited the lands in 1574, Duke Charles III of Lorraine demanded Saarwerden back as a completed fief (meaning Philip was without any heirs). The dispute went on for many years and threatened several times to escalate to military level. The Elector Palatine, Frederick III also claimed parts of the inheritance. Here too, the House of Nassau managed to prevail on the essential points. Several large treaties were closed, in which the exact rights and boundaries of the Nassau and Palatinate territories were defined. In 1575 Philip introduced the Reformation in his territories. Catholic priests were converted to the new faith or removed from office; church property was confiscated; schools were established and patronage was acquired. His implementation of the Reformation intensified his disputes with the Duchy of Lorraine, which was still Catholic. The County grew and prospered under Philip's son Ludwig IV. The Thirty Years' War also started in this time. =The war against Lorraine and the Empire= County of Saarwerden, when occupied by the Duchy of Lorraine before the Treaty of Westphalia. In 1629, Emperor Ferdinand II issued the Edict of Restitution, by which church property that had been confiscated after 1552 under the Peace of Passau, was returned to its previous owner. Based on this Edict, the Prince Bishops of Mainz and Trier claimed substantial parts of the possessions of the Nassau. The Court of Appeal ruled in 1629 in a dispute between Lorraine and Nassau, that the city and county of Saarwerden and Bockenheim and Wieberstweiler were fiefs of Metz and should therefore be returned to Lorraine, and the Nassau family could keep the rest of their county. The Duke of Lorraine, however, took possession of the whole of the County of Saarwerden and the Lordship of Herbitzheim. Count Wilhelm Ludwig appealed and took the case to the Imperial Council of Princes Because he had refused to join the Catholic League, or to provide troops, the Emperor ignored him. In 1631, King Gustav Adolph II of Sweden and his army arrived at the Rhine. Wilhelm Ludwig joined him, effectively declaring war on the Emperor. The Saarwerdische eagle in the coat-of-arms of Wilhelm Ludwig of Nassau, representing the Counties Moers, Saarwerden, Saarbrücken, (In the heart shield) Lahr, and Mahlberg. In 1633, the Swedish army attacked from the Alsace into the County of Saarwerden, which was still occupied by Lorraine. The county was conquered, but not given back to the House of Nassau. In 1635, Count Wilhelm Ludwig went to Frankfurt to attend a meeting of the Protestant states and their allies. At this meeting, it was decided that Sweden would return Saarwerden to the House of Nassau. The family went to Bockenheim, where the counties of Nassau-Saarbrücken and Saarwerden should have been handed over. However, on 30 May 1635 a number of imperial estates, including the Electorates of Brandenburg and Saxony, had concluded the Peace of Prague and the Nassau Counts were expressly excluded from this agreement. They then went to Saarbrücken. In November 1635 the imperial commissioner appeared in the Nassau lands and declared the Count had forfeited his counties and all their possessions; he was banned. The Emperor gave the Duke of Lorraine the counties of Saarbrücken and Saarwerden and the bailiwick of Herbitzheim and the fortress of Homburg on the Blies as a reward for services rendered. In 1636, Wilhelm Ludwig attempted to petition the Emperor for an imperial pardon from Metz, where he was in exile. This attempt failed, but it wasn't until 1637 that the counts were told the reasons for this imperial wrath. Only in 1639 did the Count receive a pass that enabled them to represent their cause in Vienna in person. =Restoration of Saarwerden= Wilhelm Ludwig died in 1640, and his wife, now Countess, and his son Johann Ludwig II returned to Saarbrücken. The Peace of Westphalia restored the lands of the House of Nassau. Johann Ludwig II rose to Count at the death of his mother. Because of the dispute with Lorraine, The House of Nassau had to abandon their capital of Bouquenom (Bockenheim) and the city of Sarrewerden, which had belonged to the Bishopric of Metz, which was now owned by Lorraine. They built on the opposite side of the river Saar, a new city: Neu-Saarwerden. The County had suffered from the Thirty Years' War. Count Gustav Adolph set about rebuilding the war- ravaged county, bringing back refugees, and recruiting settlers for agriculture and skilled workers. Later, Gustav became a prisoner-of-war of France and France occupied Saarwerden. After the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, his lands were returned to Ludwig Crato I and he became Regent. He was considered a good ruler, as he could keep his country out of further wars. He organized the administration of justice and the state finances. He showed benevolence and reorganized the school system. The County was restored in 1648, although Lorraine acquired the capital of Bouquenom (Bockenheim). =Neu-Saarwerden= After the expansion of France into much of Alsace and the annexation of the Duchy of Lorraine in 1766, the County of Saarwerden was an enclave of the Holy Roman Empire in France. At the time, Nassau-Saarbrücken measured about 12 square miles and it had 22,000 inhabitants. This made it one of the smallest principalities in the Holy Roman Empire. Wilhelm Heinrich I reformed the administration and justice, separating these two branches of government. He took measures to standardize taxes and introduced a modern cadastre on the Austrian model. He also promoted modern agricultural methods, such as the potato cultivation and pest control. He was also involved in coal mining and iron smelting and he nationalized the mines . He laid the basis for a proto-industrialized economy, which would later evolve into the highly industrialized Saarland region. Despite the increase in revenues, his financial situation did not improve, due to the high spending on construction activities. After his father's death in 1768, Ludwig took up the business of government in Nassau-Saarbrücken. He largely continued his father's economic policies, but was increasingly subject to financial constraints. He issued new regulations for agriculture and forestry and reformed the school system. He also reformed the penal code and abolished torture. Ludwig V, last ruling Prince of Nassau-Saarbrücken (1745–1794). The County came to be divided into three districts in 1783: *Bouquenom (Bockenheim), went to France in 1766 with the possessions of the Duchy of Lorraine. *The Bailiwick of Neuf-Sarrewerden (German: Neu-Saarwerden), covered the northern part of the County, consisting of eleven localities: Burbach, Eywiller, Herbitzheim, Keskastel, Neu- Saarwerden, Bischtroff, Rimsdorf, Schopperten, Siltzheim, Vœllerdingen, and Zollingen. These would belong to the princes of Nassau-Weilburg. *The Bailiwick of Harskirchen (German: Oberamt Harskirchen), covering the rest of the county, consisting of 29 localities, would belong to the princes of Nassau-Saarbrücken. When Ludwig V died in 1794, the County was occupied by French troops so his son, Heinrich Ludwig I never reigned. He was the last Count of Nassau-Saarbrücken. Heinrich Ludwig died in 1797, leaving the County to his cousin Karl Wilhelm of Nassau-Usingen. However, under the Treaty of Lunéville, the territories on the left bank of the Rhine were lost to France. The Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803 compensated Karl Wilhelm. The former County of Saarwerden passed into France as the Sarrewerden District of Bas- Rhin in 1793 (See Alsace bossue).

Range Resources Corporation, Williams Gas/Laurel Mountain Midstream, MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P., MarkWest Energy Group, L.L.C., and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection was a case in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County, Pennsylvania (Civil Division). The trial was held in August 2011. Chris Hallowich (Born), and his wife Stephanie Hallowich, operated a farm in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania. They sued Range Resources Corporation, Williams Gas/Laurel Mountain Midstream, MarkWest Energy, and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for compensation for \\"health and environmental impacts\\" from \\"natural gas development operations\\". In the settlement, the plaintiffs received $750,000 from the sale of their home for the purchase of a home elsewhere, but were required to abstain, along with their two minor children, from ever again discussing hydraulic fracturing or Marcellus Shale. The filed Washington County court documents in the case show that the Hallowich family was represented by Peter M. Villari, Esq. and Robert N. Wilkey, Esq. of Villari, Brandes, Kline,P.C., a litigation firm located in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. The case received significant international notoriety concerning the issue of First Amendment rights as it relates to confidential settlement agreements, gag-orders, and the constitutional rights of minors within the scope of the natural gas drilling industry, operations, and civil litigation. On March 20, 2011, Judge Debbie O'Dell-Senaca, issued an Order and Opinion, reversing a prior trial court's order to seal the settlement documents, and ordering that the Court record, including the settlement documents be unsealed. Many of the Defendants in the case subsequently appealed, seeking to keep the settlement documents sealed. Eventually, the settlement documents in the Hallowich case were restored and made publicly available. References External links *Stephanie Hallowich and Chris Hallowich, H/W, v.

The theme of the film is young love during a school exchange in France, complicated by language barriers and cultural differences.  Synopsis  Henrik hates French lessons with Monsieur Nouvelleville and grows to dislike all things French. But then he falls in love with Valerie of all people, who because of her French Mother is close to the language and culture and therefore takes part in the exchange programme. In order to prove his love to her, Henrik takes part in the exchange together with his friend Johannes. Since unfortunately Henrik hardly speaks any French, communication turns out to be exceedingly difficult. After he misses the opportunity to get close to her on a stopover in Paris, he is shocked to learn at the first meeting with the local students that Valerie already has a French boyfriend. Not only is Henrik now jealous of Mathieu, but also frustrated because of the strange French customs he learns about in the company of his exchange partner Cyril, who lives on a farm. Initially Henrik annoys Valerie with his attacks on Mathieu, but a short time later he learns that they’ve split up because Mathieu was being unfaithful with French girl Charlotte. Valerie is now ready for a date with the timid but genuine boy. The pair arranges to meet at a party and there seems to be nothing else in the way of love. However Henry has not considered that it is customary for the French to eat a long evening meal. As he arrives very late to the party, Charlotte gets in his way. She talks to him in English and tries to seduce him. After Valerie has consumed an excessive amount of alcohol, Henrik takes her home and resists the temptation to take advantage of her intoxicated state. At the farewell party with all the participants, he impresses his beloved by starting to sing \\"Bonsoir mes amis\\" instead of stammering a thank you speech. But Charlotte doesn’t give up and visits Henrik at his guest family’s house. After Valerie sees the two in bed, she plans to travel to Brittany to spend time with her uncle. Henry finds out at the last moment about this plan and steals the group’s coach to intercept her at the train station. There, he can convince her of his true love, whereupon Valerie forgives him and they kiss.

The first tropical cyclone of the regional season, Sam originated from a tropical low that formed in the Arafura Sea on 28 November. Tracking generally westward, the initial low-pressure area remained generally weak until it entered the Timor Sea, by which time it had strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 5 December. Though a subtropical ridge was forcing the cyclone westward at the time, an approaching shortwave trough caused Sam to track southward the following day, towards the Australian coast. During its southward progression, Sam rapidly intensified, and reached its peak intensity on 8 December. Soon afterwards, the storm made landfall near Lagrange, Western Australia at the same intensity. Once inland, Sam was slow to weaken as it re- curved eastward, and persisted for nearly a week inland before dissipating on 14 December. Throughout its existence, Cyclone Sam brought heavy rainfall to a wide swath of northern Australia. Rainfall peaked at in Shelamar over a 48-hour period ending on 11 December. Upon making landfall, damage was considerable, albeit localized. Most of the destruction wrought by Sam occurred near the coast, particularly in Bidyadanga and Anna Springs Station. Some buildings sustained considerable damage, and trees and power lines were felled, resulting in some power outages. Offshore, 163 illegal immigrants aboard two vessels were feared to have drowned, which would make Sam one of the deadliest cyclones in Australian history. However, these people were later accounted for. After the season, the name Sam was retired from the regional naming list. Meteorological history During an active Madden–Julian oscillatory period over Australian longitudes in late November, a broad low- pressure area developed within the monsoon trough in the southeastern Arafura Sea, west of Cape York Peninsula. Due to its potential for development, the Bureau of Meteorology Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Darwin (TCWC Darwin) began monitoring the system on 28 November. Tracking westward, the low eventually moved into the Timor Sea three days later and became quasi- stationary in forward motion. Situated within a good outflow environment, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the disturbance at 0300 UTC on 1 December, assessing it with a 'poor' likelihood of cyclogenesis; these probabilities as assessed by the JTWC would increase up until eventual formation. Nonetheless, TCWC Darwin began issuing tropical-related products on the disturbance beginning at 0730 UTC the following day. At 0000 UTC on 3 December, the JTWC analyzed that the tropical low had organized into a tropical depression. Due to weak steering currents, the depression drifted southward and moved ashore the Kimberley coast roughly east of Kalumbaru; this stint over land was short lived, however, and the system tracked back westward, reentering the warm Timor Sea the following day. Positioned within favorable conditions under a subtropical ridge, the depression began to strengthen. At 0400 UTC on 5 December, TCWC Perth, having assumed local area responsibilities for the tracking of the storm, determined the system to have strengthened into a tropical cyclone. As such, the warning center assigned the name Sam to the storm. Although a tropical cyclone warning was issued twelve hours prior, the JTWC followed suit by classifying Sam as a tropical storm at 1200 UTC the same day. Upon tropical cyclogenesis on 5 December, the surrounding atmospheric conditions were generally favorable for continued development, however, a northeasterly wind flow generated wind shear, somewhat inhibiting development and partially exposing Sam's low level center of circulation as it tracked westward. Over the following two days, however, the tropical cyclone's rainbands were able to fully enclose the center of circulation. During the evening hours of 6 December, however, Sam began to interact with a shortwave trough, causing the cyclone to curve southward and towards the northwestern coast of Australia. Over the following day, an eye started to form and Sam began to rapidly intensify. At 0400 UTC, the storm attained Category 3 cyclone intensity on the Bureau of Meteorology cyclone scale. Ten hours later, Category 4 intensity was achieved. At the time, Sam had featured an eye measuring 30 mi (40 km) in diameter. Objective Dvorak intensity analysis gave the system a rating of 7.7, corresponding to an estimated intensity of 215 km/h (135 mph). Around the same time, Sam briefly became stationary before resuming its southward trek. Continuing to intensify, TCWC Perth upgraded the cyclone to Category 5 intensity at 2000 UTC, with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a minimum pressure of 950 hPa (mbar; 28.06 inHg). However, in post-storm analysis, it was analyzed that Sam had had in fact peaked with winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) and a minimum pressure of 935 hPa (mbar; 27.61 inHg). The JTWC rated the storm as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. At the same intensity, Sam made landfall near Lagrange, Western Australia at 1300 UTC on 8 December. Upon moving ashore, Sam began to slowly weaken over the Great Sandy Desert. On 9 December, the JTWC ceased the monitoring of the system, as the weakened Sam began to curve eastward. After a brief period of restrengthening over central Australia on 13 December, Sam finally weakened below tropical cyclone intensity the following day before dissipating shortly thereafter. Preparations and impact As a precursor low-pressure area, Sam brought widespread rainfall throughout a wide swath of northern Australia. Due to its proximity to the coast throughout its existence, associated rainfall continued to affect the region throughout Sam's existence. As Sam approached the coast, numerous warnings were issued, with storm warnings posted for Cape Leveque to Pardoo Station on 8 December. Meteorologists indicated that the storm would be a threat to shipping in the immediate regions. Due to its impending threat to the northwestern coast of Australia, most of the residents of Bidyadanga and Anna Springs Station were evacuated via helicopter. Upon landfall, though severe damage was wrought, damage was localized. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was a measurement of 973 mbar (hPa; 28.74 inHg). Some buildings were severely damaged, and trees, power lines, sheds, and fences were downed by the strong winds. Staff quarters and sheds in the Anna Plains Station were demolished. The cattle station also lost electrical power during the storm. Roughly off the coast of western Australia, two illegal immigration vessels departing from Indonesia and bound for the Ashmore Islands was caught within Cyclone Sam. As a result, the two ships, in total carrying 167 illegal immigrants, sank. A nearby Japanese tanker was only able to rescue four survivors, and as such the 163 others were assumed dead. However, the stricken passengers were later found in Indonesia. Five Britons aboard a ketch sailing from London to Sydney were shipwrecked by the storm on 6 December; the ketch was later refueled and repaired by . Heavy rainfall caused by Sam resulted in flooding further inland. A weather station in Shelamar near the point of landfall recorded of precipitation in a 48-hour period ending during the morning hours of 11 December. However, this was likely only a 24-hour measurement due to a lack of human observation as a result of area evacuations. Due to the destruction wrought by Sam, the name was retired after the season. This made it the 34th tropical cyclone within the area of responsibility of TCWC Perth to have its name retired.

(The New York Times reporting a day after the riots mentioned four people dead.Four of the Mob Killed in an Anti-Tax Riot in Sicily, The New York Times, December 27, 1893) Background of the massacre At the time of the uprising the town had 18,000 inhabitants and was mainly a town of sulphur miners. Working conditions in the mines were appalling, including child labour by so-called carusi. Le sette vittime del Natale 1893, La Sicilia, December 7, 2008 The Fascio dei Lavoratori in Lercara Friddi had been founded between July and September 1893 among peasants and sulphur miners. On November 8, 1893, a committee was formed to negotiate with the landowners and mine-owners to improve working conditions. However, the political situation was also marked by a fierce battle between the Sartorio and the Nicolosi families about who would rule the town. Different \\"spurious\\" elements were present in the Fascio of Lercara Friddi that responded more to the logic of the struggle for the conquest of power between the powerful local town families, rather than the need for social emancipation of the workers. Serious disagreements emerged within the Fascio, and Bernardino Verro, the charismatic leader of the Fascio in Corleone, was asked to intervene. He arrived on December 19, 1893, and found a chaotic situation and irresponsible spending of the organisation's funds. He dissolved the organisation and nominated a committee to reorganise it. The intervention of Verro caused discontent, in particular with the former secretary Francesco Piazza. The dissenters wanted to organise a demonstration the next day, but were stopped by Verro, claiming that violence against the tax tollhouses and municipality would be counterproductive and that in the strictly organized movement in Corleone these kinds of disorders did not happen. However, after Verro left, the protests did erupt. The massacre Already on December 24, protesters against high excise duties had sacked and burned tollhouses.More Tax Riots in Sicily, The New York Times, December 25, 1893 Government troops and authorities were sent to the town. The next day, on Christmas, several thousand protestors gathered again at the central square before the municipality. Their shouts Down with taxes! Down with the mayor! were greeted with Death to the instigators! from the balconies of the houses of the affluent on the main square. The sub-prefect of Palermo tried to calm down the rally, promising the abolition of the duties, while addressing them from the balcony of the town hall. He had to withdraw because the protesters started throwing rocks. With the public prosecutor and the examining magistrate, he was forced to flee by climbing down a window at the back. On the square, protesters with rocks and sticks confronted government troops that opened fire when the mob risked to break through, leaving several dead and many wounded. Aftermath The Lercara Friddi massacre was one of the first in a series of bloody incidents that would lead up to the proclamation of a state of siege by Prime minister Francesco Crispi on January 4, 1894, that would crack down heavily on the Fasci.

Overview  Founded in the mid 1960s, by a graduate student from the University of Michigan at a time when the first general purpose transistorized logic modules and low-cost general-purpose computers produced by Digital Equipment Corporation were available on the market, ICS provided industrial automation hardware and software design services to industries in the Detroit, Michigan area . Initially focused on software services only, as these low cost-computers began to become available from many companies such as Hewlett- Packard, Varian, Computer Automation, Microdata, Data General and others, ICS began a transition from a software company into a “system” house with both software and hardware staffs. By the late 1960s, ICS’s management recognized the significance of IBM’s magnetic tape/Selectric typewriter (MT/ST) automated typing system, introduced in 1964 and gaining attention in office typing pools as a productivity improvement tool for documentation creation and editing. Even though the MT/ST was limited in its capabilities, it was a large step forward towards creating “clean” documents without erasure, or whiteout correction fluid/tape. Having gained design experience with hardware automation and control systems, as well as real-time process control programming, ICS believed that the MT/ST could be improved on in many ways using the PDP-8 general purpose computer coupled with the unique (pseudo \\"disk like\\") DECtape drive offered by Digital Equipment Corp. In late 1967 the company decided that it made better business sense to become more of a \\"product\\" based than contract services company, and begin design efforts to create one of the first stand-alone computer controlled Word Processing systems. ICS Astrotype tapes. The ICS label on one tape canister is obviously pasted over a DECtape label, while one tape has a generic 3M label. Combining the PDP-8 computer with the DECtape's small 4-inch (10 cm) reel of tape that held over 350,000 characters (versus the 25,000 characters on an MT/ST tape) and allowing random access (albeit slower) like a floppy disk, the DECtape units allowed much more flexible storage access, and thus the potential for a much more capable word processor design than the MT/ST which used a slow sprocket hole driven tape (much like a film strip) to record a single character at a time and could only read/write a maximum of 20 characters per second, and had limited search capabilities. The high speed, random addressable, general purpose DECtape computer drive, coupled with a general purpose mini-computer appeared to offer a significant opportunity for an extremely capable word processing system. This design approach also offered an economic advantage as additional terminals could be added (up to 7 additional) to the initial single station system, resulting in a very capable system with approximately the same price per station (~$10,000) as a collection of MT/ST units but with far more capability. Like the MT/ST, the ASTROTYPE system utilized the IBM Selectric typewriter. IBM offered a “terminal” version of the Selectric for use as a computer console I/O device and the IBM 2741 Terminal, that offered significant advantages over the Teletype and Flexowriter terminals in general use at that time. These modified Selectrics featured electronically interfaced typing mechanisms and keyboards and thus provided a typing station with IBM quality that was easily connected to a computer. An ICS Astrotype system consisting of a PDP-8/L system with 8K 12-bit words of memory, plus two simplified TU55 tape drives (branded Astrotype).

In humans, this subset of the proteome encompasses 13-20% of all proteins, including cytokines, growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins and regulators, and shed receptors. The secretome of a specific tissue can be measured by mass spectrometry and its analysis constitutes a type of proteomics known as secretomics. Definition The term secretome was coined by Tjalsma and colleagues in 2004 to denote all the factors secreted by a cell, along with the secretory pathway constituents. In 2010, this definition of secretome was revised to include only proteins secreted into the extracellular space. Related concepts include the matrisome, which is the subset of the secretome that includes extracellular matrix proteins and their associated proteins; the receptome, which includes all membrane receptors, and the adhesome, which includes all proteins involved in cell adhesion.  Quantification  The secreted proteins in humans account for 13–20% of the entire proteome and include growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules, proteases and shed receptors. Human protein- coding genes (39%, 19613 genes) are predicted to have either a signal peptide and/or at least one transmembrane region suggesting active transport of the corresponding protein out of the cell (secretion) or location in one of the numerous membrane systems in the cell. Increasing evidence showed that, in addition to the protein cargo, non-protein components, such as lipid, micro- RNAs and messenger-RNA, could also be secreted by cells via both microvesicles (100–>1000 nm diameter) − shedding from the plasma membrane − and exosomes (30–150 nm diameter) − released via endosomal-exocytosis event. Factors present in both these organelles accounts for up to 42% of the secretome and have been incorporated as the collective secretome. There is a vast array of methodologies available to study cell secretomes of plant cells, mammalian cells, stem cells and cancer cells.

It was signed on 9 December 1917 in Focșani in Romania. Background Romania had entered World War I in August 1916, invading Austria-Hungary in an attempt to seize Transylvania. However, the Central Powers launched a successful counteroffensive in September 1916, capturing Bucharest and occupying approximately two thirds of the Romanian territory by December 1916. The Romanian government was forced to retreat to Iași, in the historical region of Moldavia, but was able to stave off complete collapse thanks to the numerous Russian reinforcements that had been sent to Romania to prevent a Central Power invasion of southern Russia at the beginning of 1917, and later, in spite of the unwillingness of the Russian troops to continue fighting, thanks to the successful repulse of the Central Powers' offensive at Mărășești and Oituz.Home, p.455Tucker, p.1555 Truce The delegates of the negotiating parties After the October Revolution of 1917, Russia fell into civil war, and the Russian government began withdrawing its troops from Romania. On 4 and 5 December 1917, the Russians signed two ceasefire agreements with the Central Powers, followed later (on 15 December) by a full armistice and, under the direction of Leon Trotsky and Adolph Joffe, peace negotiations with the Central Powers in Brest-Litovsk. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk made Romania geographically exposed. Lacking Russian support, the Romanian government was subsequently forced to sue for peace. The resulting truce was signed on 9 December 1917 in Focșani on the Siret River, which was the site of the main Romanian defensive line. The armistice ended Romanian hostilities with Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire. Aftermath While the fighting had ended, much of Romania remained under Central Power occupation after the truce. In May 1918, the Romanian government signed the punitive Treaty of Bucharest, which required Romania to cede the province of Dobruja and several passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and grant multiple economic privileges to the Central Powers.Home, p.456 In 1919, Romania's territorial cessions to Germany were renounced in the Treaty of Versailles. Romania's cessions to Austria-Hungary were renounced in the Treaty of Saint- Germain in 1919 and the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, while the cessions to Bulgaria were renounced in the Treaty of Neuilly in 1919.

Tribes in this region include the Guaraní, Ayoreo, Toba-Maskoy, Aché and Sanapan which according to the census from 2002 number an estimated 86,000 or roughly around 2 per cent of the total population. These peoples have faced persecution particularly under the dictator Alfredo Strossner that some observers call a Genocide of indigenous peoples in Paraguay. Repression under Alfredo Stroessner Between 1956 and 1989, while under the military rule of General Alfredo Stroessner, the indigenous population had more territory taken than at any other period in Paraguay's history and were subjected to systematic human rights abuses. In 1971, Mark Münzel, a German anthropologist accused Stroessner of attempted genocide against the indigenous peoples of Paraguay and Bartomeu Melià, a Jesuit anthropologist stated that the forced relocations of the indigenous peoples was ethnocide. In the early 1970s the Stroessner regime was charged by international groups of being complicit in genocide. However, because of the repressive actions undertaken by the state the indigenous tribes organized themselves politically and had a major role in bringing about the end of the military dictatorship and the eventual transition to democracy. The state financed these repressive actions with U.S. aid, which totaled $146 million for the years 1962 to 1975. Destruction of the Ache tribe During the 1960s and 1970s, 85 percent of the Aché tribe died, with many hacked to death with machetes to make room for the timber industry, mining, farming and ranchers. One estimate posits this amounts to 900 deaths. According to Jérémie Gilbert, the situation in Paraguay has proven that it is difficult to provide the proof required to show \\"specific intent\\", in support of a claim that genocide had occurred. The Aché, whose cultural group is now seen as extinct, fell victim to the development by the state, who had promoted the exploration of Aché territory by transnational companies for natural resources. Gilbert concludes that though planned and voluntary destruction had occurred, it is argued by the state that there was no intent to destroy the Aché, as what had happened was due to development. Assessment of persecution as a genocide The allegation of genocide by the state was brought before the Inter-American Human Rights Commission which has jurisdiction on allegations of genocide carried out by a state. The commission gave a provisional ruling that Paraguay had not carried out a genocide, but stated it had concerns over \\"possible abuses by private persons in remote areas of the territory of Paraguay\\".

It was directed by Marius Penczner and filmed by students from Memphis State University, now known as the University of Memphis. Plot After landing by Pleasantville, United States, the aliens convince two Earth criminals to help them rule the world. The aliens hypnotize people into a \\"zomboid state\\" and unleash a reptilian creature. Two F.B.I. agents fight against the aliens, criminals, and the creature to combat the threat of imminent world domination. Production Inspired by 1950s science fiction films, I Was a Zombie for the F.B.I. was filmed in black-and-white by Memphis State students and was directed by Marius Penczner. The film's budget was $27,000, which came from the director's Emmy award-winning short film. The stop motion reptilian monster was later used in the director's film TV Dinners. Reception Bob Dylan and Dennis Hopper enjoyed the film, as did the bands ZZ Top and The Everly Brothers. Dylan said that he wished he was in the film. Mac McEntire, writing for DVD Verdict, said that he liked the film, but that \\"long stretches of dialogue with little to no action might be true to the era to which this film pays tribute, but it might move a little too slowly for some of today's viewers\\". Andy McKeague, of Monsters and Critics, wrote that \\"Zombie is a fun film, but one you need to be in the right mood for. It has all the markings of the 1950s TV cop shows it deliberately resembles and enough of the E.T. savvy to appeal to fans of Plan 9 to The X-files\\".

However, on November 30, 2014, the Appellate Court of Qatar declared the Huangs innocent, and three days later lifted the travel ban allowing them to return home and be reunited with their sons. Background The Huangs moved to Qatar with their three young children in 2012. Matthew Huang, a Stanford-trained engineer, was relocated there by his employer, MWH Global, to work for two years on a major infrastructure project related to the 2022 World Cup improvements. Matthew and Grace had adopted all three of their children from Africa. In all of the adoptions, the Huangs used a respected adoption agency and obtained all the proper visas from the State Department. The Huangs’ middle child was Gloria, whom they adopted from an orphanage in Ghana when she was 4 years old in 2009 and who had chronic eating disorders according to the parents. Gloria Huang In Ghana, Gloria was born into extreme poverty and grew up in impoverished conditions up through her time in an orphanage. \\"The Huangs describe her eating issues as a sporadic behavioral problem that resulted in Gloria sometimes going days where she refused to eat. She would then follow such fasting with unhealthy binge eating and attempts to find food from bizarre sources, such as in the trash or from neighbors. The Huangs were aware of their daughter’s eating issues, had educated themselves about the best way to handle those issues, and were attempting to manage the situation and help her grow out of it.\\" Matthew and Grace Huang say that Gloria had eating disorders. The California Innocence Project has said that Gloria died of her eating disorder. On January 15, 2013, Gloria died unexpectedly and suddenly. The death certificate, issued by Qatar’s supreme council of health, listed the causes of death as \\"cachexia and dehydration\\". Her parents were subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder and human trafficking. Matthew and Grace Huang Prior to moving Doha, Qatar, Matthew and Grace Huang lived in San Gabriel, California. The Huangs have three adopted African children. While the Huangs are detained, their other two children are being cared for by their grandmother. Matthew Huang graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 1998. He graduated from Stanford University with a master's degree in 1999. Matthew has worked for MWH Global since July 1999. Matthew is a licensed civil engineer in California. Matthew moved to Doha with his wife, Grace, and their three children (all of whom were adopted), in 2012 because MWH Global relocated him there to work for two years on a major infrastructure project related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Grace Huang homeschooled the three children in Qatar. In October 2013, the Huangs two other children left Qatar to live with family back in the United States. Prior to this, their grandmother had flown to Qatar to care for them while Matthew and Grace were in custody. This came as a result of a private negotiations between the Huang's representatives and the Qatar Attorney General Ali bin Fetais al- Marri. Matthew and Grace Huang were released from custody on November 6, 2013, but still faced charges. Detainment Matthew and Grace Huang were detained by Qatar police on January 15, 2013. They were released from custody on November 6, 2013. If convicted, they could face the death sentence, although Qatar has maintained a moratorium on actual executions for more than a decade. Case =Police investigation= According to the \\"California Innocence Project\\" the report filed by the police in the investigation noted that the children were not “good-looking” and did not share the “hereditary traits” of their parents. The CIP reported that investigations also theorize that Matthew and Grace “bought” their children in order to harvest their organs, or perhaps to perform medical experiments on them, allegations arising from the testimony of unnamed sources who claimed that family kept to themselves and did not socialize However, friends of the family in Qatar came forward to praise Matthew and Grace’s parenting skills and the way they care for and love their children. One family was even at the Huang's home the night before Gloria's death, where they say that they witnessed Gloria walking around and sitting with the family. =Forensic evidence= While the death certificate indicated that the causes of death as \\"cachexia and dehydration,\\" an independent review performed by a US pediatric forensic pathologist questioned the determination. The formal definition of cachexia is the loss of body mass that cannot be reversed nutritionally. Cachexia can produce symptoms such as weight loss and muscle atrophy, which often looks similar to starvation, and can be caused by a range of conditions, including congestive heart failure and autoimmune diseases. These causes were not screened in the report by the medical examiner in Doha. One theory of Gloria's death was that she was starved. Eyewitness accounts claim that the last time Gloria was seen eating was four days prior to her death. However, Gloria was witnessed walking around her home the day before she died by a visiting family. Her brothers recounted to the police how they had played with her and that she had appeared normal in the days before she died. While a child can go a few days without eating without risk of starvation, a child would not have the physical strength to walk one day before death due to starvation. As noted in the report by the Qatari medical examiner, Dr. Anis Mahmoud Khalifa, Gloria also lacked other physical hallmarks of a child who was starved to death or abused. There were also several other considerations regarding Gloria's medical history that were not addressed by the medical examiner. Gloria suffered from giardia when she was adopted, an infection which is difficult to completely eliminate. She also had recent blood tests showing severely low levels of a certain type of leukocytes that may have been a sign of an underlying bone marrow condition. In addition, Gloria had a vitamin D deficiency. The medical examiner's report also made no mention of testing the vitreous humour, the clear gel inside the eyes, which is a standard way to diagnose dehydration. Gloria's bodily fluids were tested only for drugs, poison and semen, and all tests were negative. Due to the non- conclusive results of the autopsy, the cause of death for Gloria was never established by the prosecution. Despite lacking this essential evidence for pursuing murder charges, the prosecutor insisted that the parents intentionally harmed their daughter. =Trial= In the court hearing of June 18, 2013, several witnesses testified for the prosecution. A police detective from the criminal investigation department said that according to information gathered from “intelligence sources we knew that the defendant once has taken away a candy off the girl’s hand, and grounded her for eating it.” Pertaining to the issue of adoption, detective Ahmad Issac Hamoudah Abu Zoro told the court, “As you are aware, the deceased child has black complexion, very skinny while her parents are white. Parents who wish to adopt children should be selective so that their kids are supposed to be beautiful.” Adoption outside of biological families does not occur in Qatar or in other Gulf Arab societies. The California Innocence Project claims that Qatari police records stated that it was odd that the Asian Huangs had adopted black children who were not “good looking” and who didn’t share their “hereditary traits.” In addition, Dr. Anis Mahmoud Khalifa, the medical examiner who conducted Gloria's autopsy, openly told the court, “I never mentioned in my report or statements the word “starvation” but rather emaciation,” contradicting the prosecution's basis for charging her parents with starving Gloria to death. The request to drop the charges against the American couple were rejected and bail was declined. On Tuesday, October 1, 2013, Judge Abdullah Al-Emady ordered the Huangs to remain imprisoned until at least their next hearing, which is scheduled for November 6, 2013. Officials raised questions about the Huangs paying adoption fees to an adoption agency. After Tuesday's hearing, Matthew proclaimed his innocence. On March 27, 2014, Matthew and Grace were each sentenced to three years in prison and fined 15,000 Qatari Riyals. No verdict was read by the judge. The couple was not detained, pending the appeals process, but remained restricted from leaving the country. The travel ban went against the precedent set in the Villagio Mall fire, where 5 Qataris were sentenced to 6 years in prison after being convicted of murder by negligence, but were allowed to travel without restriction during appeals. The U.S. State Department issued a statement following the judicial announcement, noting that they were \\"surprised and disappointed\\" by the result. Several weeks later, the defendants were notified that they had been found guilty of child endangerment, a different crime from that which they had been originally charged and tried. = Court of Appeals = Following two procedural hearings in which the appeals of the defense and prosecution were both heard and accepted, the charges were merged into a single appeals trial on June 16, 2014. In that hearing, the defense argued for the closure of the appeals for judgment and presenting closing arguments and written arguments. The prosecution requested for the forensic pathologist that did the original autopsy to testify again before the appellate court. The judges deliberated and accepted the prosecutor's motion, and set the next trial date for October 20, 2014, spanning over 4 months of waiting for Matthew and Grace, while unable to travel home. During this time, the U.S. State Department issued its first public statement of support for the Huangs: \\"On July 30, 2014, Under Secretary for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman and Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Anne Patterson met with family and representatives of U.S. citizens Matthew and Grace Huang concerning their ongoing legal proceedings in Qatar following the tragic death of their daughter, Gloria. Under Secretary Sherman conveyed concern for the Huang family’s well-being, adding that assisting U.S. citizens in need overseas was among the Department’s highest priorities. Senior U.S. Government officials have raised the Huangs’ case with the Government of Qatar on multiple occasions, and the State Department will continue to engage Qatari officials at the highest levels. We seek the Qatari Government’s assistance in providing a fair and expeditious conclusion to the proceedings. We also urge the Qatari Government to lift the current travel ban and allow Mr. and Mrs. Huang to return home to the United States to be reunited with their two sons and the rest of their family.\\"'' The State Department then issued a follow-up statement on October 6, 2014: \\"The U.S. Government continues to closely follow the legal proceedings in Qatar of American citizens Matthew and Grace Huang, whose appeals hearing is set for October 20. Mr. and Mrs. Huang have been detained in Qatar since the tragic death of their daughter in January 2013. The U.S. Government strongly urges that the Qatari Government immediately lift the travel ban and allow Mr. and Mrs. Huang to return to the United States on a humanitarian basis to be reunited with their children and family, pending the completion of legal proceedings. We continue to call on the Qatari Government to bring the case to an expeditious and just conclusion.\\"'' On October 20, 2014, the first appeals hearings for the Huang case began. In court, the prosecutor reexamined the forensic pathologist, who read his testimony from a document on his podium. The witness contradicted his previous testimony by stating that there was no food or water in Gloria's intestines, and that it was not his job to determine whether she had died of starvation. As the Huang's attorney began his cross- examination of the witness, he was stopped by the judge, and not allowed to complete his duty to his clients. During the prosecutor's final arguments in which he argued that the children had been purchased and that they had murdered their daughter, Matthew shouted out \\"You lie! You lie!\\" at the prosecutor, which shocked the courtroom. The judges then closed the argument portion of the appeals trial and set the verdict hearing for November 30, 2014. =Employer pressure to return to work= The new element is an increasingly bitter legal dispute with Matthew Huang’s American employer, MWH Global, which requested — now that he was out of prison — that Matthew return to work or forfeit further pay and benefits. In what the employer is calling a personnel issue and Matthew Huang is calling an unrealistic demand that amounts to forced dismissal, he resigned. =Representation= Due to the overwhelming medical evidence of Matthew and Grace Huang's innocence, they have been pro bono clients of the California Innocence Project (part of the Innocence Project based at the California Western School of Law in San Diego) since June 2013. The Huangs are also represented by Lewis and Roca. The Huang case is being managed by the Los Angeles-based David House Agency, an international crisis resource agency that has handled other notable cases such as the case of American Hikers in Iran, Amanda Knox, and Jason Puracal. =Petition to Qatar= An official petition written by Grace's sister has been posted to Change.org. The petition is addressed to the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Susan L. Ziadeh, and Ambassador of the State of Qatar Mohammed Jaham Al Kuwari. The request is for these individuals to compel the Qatar government to end the imprisonment they consider wrongful of Matthew and Grace, and allow them to be reunited with their sons in the U.S. See also *2022 FIFA World Cup *Children's rights *Human rights in Qatar *Interracial adoption *International adoption *Villagio Mall References Huang Case Category:Qatari law Category:Adoption, fostering, orphan care and displacement Category:Deaths in Qatar Category:American people imprisoned abroad Category:People from San Gabriel, California Category:Eating disorders ","title":"2013 Huang Case in Qatar"},{"id":"40200283","text":"Silver Creek Airport is an airport serving the Stann Creek District, Belize.

Americanah tells the story of a young Nigerian woman, Ifemelu, who immigrates to the United States to attend university. The novel traces Ifemelu's life in both countries, threaded by her love story with high school classmate Obinze. It was Adichie's third novel, published on May 14, 2013 by Alfred A. Knopf. A television miniseries, starring and produced by Lupita Nyong'o, was in development for HBO Max.Walsh, Savannah (January 17, 2020). \\"Everything We Know About Americanah, The HBO Max Series Starring Lupita Nyong'o\\". Elle. Retrieved 27 April 2020.  Summary  As teenagers in a Lagos secondary school, Ifemelu and Obinze fall in love. Nigeria at the time is under military dictatorship, and people are seeking to leave the country. Ifemelu moves to the United States to study, where she struggles for the first time with racism and the many varieties of racial distinctions: for the first time, Ifemelu discovers what it means to be a \\"Black Person\\".Stefanie Anna Reuter: \\"Becoming a Subject: Developing a Critical Consciousness and Coming to Voice in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Americanah\\", in: Anja Oed (Hg.): Reviewing the Past, Negotiating the Future: The African Bildungsroman (forthcoming). Obinze had hoped to join her in the U.S. but he is denied a visa after 9/11. He goes to London, eventually becoming an undocumented immigrant after his visa expires. Years later, Obinze returns to Nigeria and becomes a wealthy man as a property developer in the newly democratic country. Ifemelu gains success in the United States, where she becomes known for her blog about race in America, entitled \\"Raceteenth or Various Observations About American Blacks (Those Formerly Known as Negroes) by a Non-American Black\\". When Ifemelu returns to Nigeria, the two consider reviving a relationship in light of their diverging experiences and identities during their many years apart.  Characters  * Ifemelu - the protagonist of Americanah. She is born in Lagos, Nigeria, and studies in America. * Obinze – Raised in Nsukka, Nigeria. His mother, a professor, taught him how to cook and fostered his love of books. * Obinze's Mother- Obinze's mother is a professor at Nsukka University and a widow. She struggles with outdated Nigerian attitudes towards women. * Ifemelu's Mother and Father- Ifemelu's mother is a devout evangelical Christian who fasts dangerously in order to drive the Devil out of her family's life. Ifemelu's father is powerless to stop her. He unexpectedly loses his job at a federal agency and is unable to support his family. * Aunty Uju - Ifemelu's cousin who acts as Ifemelu's older sister. She starts a relationship with the General, which leads to the birth of Dike. After the General dies, Uju moves to America, where she struggles to continues the medical training she began in Nigeria. * Dike - Dike is Aunty Uju and the General's son, who moves with his mother to the United States. He lives first in New York, then Massachusetts. His suicide attempt devastates his family and underlines the difficulty immigrant families face when trying to integrate into American society. * The General- The General is Aunty Uju's lover and Dike's father. * Curt - Ifemelu's first American boyfriend. * Blaine - Ifemelu's second American boyfriend, an assistant professor at Yale who writes a blog about race and popular culture. Ifemelu moves to New Haven to live with him. * Shan- Blaine's sister. She is a writer who is often critical of others. * Kosi - Obinze's wife and the mother of his child. * Buchi- Obinze and Kosi's daughter.  Themes  = Americanization = Americanization is one of the biggest themes in Americanah. In the context of the novel, America itself is a symbol of hope, wealth, social and economic mobility, and, ultimately, disappointment, as Ifemelu learns that the American Dream is a lie and that the advantages she enjoys there often come at a great price. Her Americanization is slow but distinct, and she gradually picks up the slang, adapts to her surroundings (for better or worse), and adopts American politics. Her views on gender and race change because of this, and her blog is devoted to exploring the issue of race as a non-American black in America. She's called Americanah when she returns to Nigeria, having picked up a blunt, American way of speaking and of addressing problems. She resists this label, but it's obvious to the reader that Ifemelu's years in America have changed her. According to Idowu Faith, “no valid statement can be made on Americanah without deconstructing the term “Americanah” which, more or less, reveals the thesis of the narrative as well as the preoccupation of Adichie in the text.” In Nigerian parlance, the term “Americanah” is an identity term that is premised on a person’s previous experience of living in America. In an interview, Adichie defines Americanah as a Nigerian word that can describe any of those who have been to the US and return American affectations; pretend not to understand their mother tongues any longer; refuse to eat Nigerian food or make constant reference to their life in America. From this understanding, it is clear that Ifemelu’s decision to return home without worrying about being identified as an “Americanah”, establishes the fact that Adichie is proposing and charting a path for a new kind of migration story whose quintessence is return migration. = Gender = Adichie's explorations of sexual education and the perception of sex among youngsters in Nigeria plays a fundamental role in the bildungsroman journey of Ifemelu exploring her sexuality as an adolescent in a puritan post-colonial society. = Migration = While many of the migratory experiences in the novel work within migration theory, Adichie simultaneously transcends the borders of international migration theories by introducing a new factor that both influences migration and projects a new perspective on return migration. According to Dustmann and Weiss (2007:237), lack of economic opportunity and escape from natural disaster/persecution are two main reasons individuals migrate throughout history. While identifying the need to flee “choicelessness” as the main reason for much of the migration in the twenty-first century Nigerian setting of the novel, Adichie uses literary dimensions to shake up the foundations of theory. Consequently, the direction of this type of migration, how it affects the bonds of love, how it changes personalities and cultural views, and how it reinterprets identity become the novelist’s major theoretical engagements. In addition, Adichie is concerned with how migration debases and elevates, how it barters and fulfills and, most significantly, how it reinvents. Reception =Reviews= Critics praised the novel, especially noting its range across different societies and reflection of global tensions. Writing for The New York Times, Mike Peed said, \\"'Americanah' examines blackness in America, Nigeria and Britain, but it's also a steady-handed dissection of the universal human experience—a platitude made fresh by the accuracy of Adichie's observations.\\" Peed concluded, \\"'Americanah' is witheringly trenchant and hugely empathetic, both worldly and geographically precise, a novel that holds the discomfiting realities of our times fearlessly before us. It never feels false.\\" Reviewing the novel for The Washington Post, Emily Raboteau called Adichie \\"a hawkeyed observer of manners and distinctions in class,\\" and said Adichie brings a \\"ruthless honesty about the ugly and beautiful sides of both\\" the United States and Nigeria. In the Chicago Tribune, Laura Pearson wrote, \\"Sprawling, ambitious and gorgeously written, 'Americanah' covers race, identity, relationships, community, politics, privilege, language, hair, ethnocentrism, migration, intimacy, estrangement, blogging, books and Barack Obama. It covers three continents, spans decades, leaps gracefully, from chapter to chapter, to different cities and other lives...[Adichie] weaves them assuredly into a thoughtfully structured epic. The result is a timeless love story steeped in our times.\\" =Awards= The book was selected as one of the 10 Best Books of 2013 by the editors of the New York Times Book Review. It won the 2013 National Book Critics Circle Award (Fiction), and was shortlisted for the 2014 Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction of the United Kingdom. The Chicago Tribune awarded Adichie its 2013 Heartland Award for Fiction, \\"recogniz[ing Americanah as] a novel that engages with important ideas about race, and does so with style, wit and insight.\\" In March 2017, Americanah was picked as the winner for the \\"One Book, One New York\\" program,Chris Weller, \\"New Yorkers just selected a book for the entire city to read in America's biggest book club\\", Business Insider, 16 March 2017.\\"One Book, One New York  And the winner is...\\", NYC. part of a community reading initiative encouraging all city residents to read the same book.John Williams, \\"One Book for Five Boroughs\\", The New York Times, 31 January 2017. =Sales= Americanah spent 78 weeks on NPR's Paperback Best-Seller list. Days after The New York Times named Americanah to its best books of 2013 list, Beyoncé also signaled her admiration of Adichie, sampling Adichie's TED Talk \\"We should all be feminists\\" on the song \\"***Flawless\\"; sales of Americanah soared and as of December 23, 2013, the book climbed to the number 179 spot on Amazon.com's list of its 10,000 best-selling books.  Adaptations  In 2014, it was announced that David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong'o would star in a film adaptation of the novel, to be produced by Brad Pitt and his production company Plan B. In 2018, Nyong'o told The Hollywood Reporter that she was developing a television miniseries based on the book, which she would produce and star in.

After a driving career in various formulae, including a win in a minor Formula One race, he became a team owner in sports car racing and Formula Two. During the 1960s and 1970s, working closely with Tyrrell Racing, he ran cars for several top drivers of the time, including Jackie Stewart, Graham Hill and Jack Brabham. Driving career The owner of a Jaguar dealership in Guildford, Coombs began racing in 1949 with a Cooper, fitted with an engine from a Rover 10. He graduated to Formula Three and campaigned a JBS in 1951, and later a Cooper-Norton and a British-built Erskine Staride. He finished on the podium on several occasions, and won two races in 1952 with the Cooper – at Thruxton and in the Commander Yorke Trophy at Silverstone, beating Bob Gerard. He also achieved the lap record at Fairwood Circuit, which still stands as the circuit was redeveloped into Swansea Airport in the late 1950s. He won at Thruxton again in 1953 in the Staride. Also in 1953, Coombs earned a test at Snetterton with the Connaught Engineering factory team, alongside Roy Salvadori, Jack Fairman and Ian Stewart. Salvadori was fastest with Coombs second, and Coombs was subsequently entered into a number of Formula Two races both in the UK and abroad. In 1954, he bought a 1.5 litre Connaught and soon replaced it with a Lotus Mark VIII, retaining the Connaught engine. With this car he achieved a number of second place finishes, and won the Cornwall MRC Formula 1 Race at Davidstow Circuit on 2 August 1954, marking the first victory for a Lotus in a Formula One race, although the Mark VIII was not a Formula One car.\\"Davidstow: A History of Cornwall's Formula One Race Circuit\\", Peter Tutthill, West Country Motor Books, 1996. He progressed to a Cooper-Bristol and a Lotus Eleven, but found that his business commitments were compromising his driving career. He therefore decided to give up driving and concentrate on preparing cars for other drivers. Team ownership =Sports cars= Coombs began by running a Lotus 15 in sports car racing for Ron Flockhart and Roy Salvadori with some success, before switching to a pair of Cooper Monacos, his drivers including Jack Brabham and Bruce McLaren. With the backing of his car dealership contacts, Coombs also ran Jaguar Mark 1s for Flockhart, Duncan Hamilton and occasionally other drivers such as Walt Hansgen. When they became available, he also prepared Mark 2s to a high specification, one of which was raced by Colin Chapman, who subsequently bought one. In 1961 Coombs used the new Jaguar E-Type, and by the following year, Graham Hill had joined his list of drivers. He also bought a Ferrari 250 GTO and lent it to Jaguar at the end of 1962 to help them prepare a new lightweight E-Type, which found success with Hill at the wheel. Coombs' team was by now racing Jaguar saloons, the E-Types, two Ferrari GTOs and an Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato. Mike Parkes, Jack Sears and Jackie Stewart had joined as drivers, although Salvadori had left. =Formula Two= In 1964, Coombs expanded his operation to include Formula Two, running a Cooper-Cosworth for Graham Hill. Switching to a Brabham-BRM, Hill beat Jim Clark at Snetterton and achieved a number of podium finishes. After Hill left the team to join Lotus in 1967, Coombs hired Piers Courage who drove a McLaren M4A. For 1968, and with support from Ken Tyrrell, Coombs prepared Matras for Stewart and Johnny Servoz-Gavin, the latter winning the 1969 European Formula Two Championship. Coombs switched back to a Brabham in 1970, for Stewart and Jack Brabham himself. During the 1970s, several up and coming drivers raced for Coombs, including Patrick Depailler and François Cevert. Later life During the 1980s, Coombs scaled down his racing operations, and switched his car dealership from Jaguar to BMW. Eventually becoming dissatisfied with BMW, he sold his dealership and retired to Monaco, although he retained a workshop in Guildford. He continued his interest in racing cars, preparing historic cars for use at the Goodwood Revival until shortly before his death in a Monaco hospital, aged 91.

Career Originally from Missouri, Nash moved to New York City in 2006. Nash performed in clubs on the Lower East Side such as The Living Room and Rockwood Music Hall. In 2009, he independently released his debut solo album, New York Town, which was recorded at The Magic Shop in New York's Soho neighborhood. New York Town was eventually picked up by Dutch label Contintental Records Services in Europe and the UK. His second album, Barn Doors and Concrete Floors, was released on March 29, 2011. The album was recorded during the summer of 2010 on a small farm located in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York. Nash recruited Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley to co-produce the album and play drums on all the tracks. Ted Young engineered the album. For this album, Nash drew from his circle of friends to form his backing band including Joey McClellan (Midlake, The Fieros) on lead guitar, Aaron McClellan (The Fieros) on bass guitar, and Eric Swanson on bass, mandolin, and banjo. Released by Continental Record Services, the album garnered further attention in Europe and the UK and received positive reviews in publications like The Independent. Barn Doors and Concrete Floors was also chosen as the top album of 2011 by the Euro Americana Charts. Extensive touring in Europe in support of Barn Doors helped Nash gain greater exposure. In late 2011, Nash left New York City and moved to Dripping Springs, Texas. His third record, Israel Nash's Rain Plans, was recorded in the summer of 2012. Rain Plans was produced by Nash and again engineered by Ted Young. The album was tracked on a Studer 16-track 2\\" analog tape machine intentionally avoiding the use of modern digital recording technology. Nash's house outside of Dripping Springs served as the studio and residence for the band during the recording session. The band consisted of Nash's touring lineup from the Barn Doors album cycle, including drummer Josh Fleischmann, Joey and Aaron McClellan on guitar and bass (respectively), and Eric Swanson on pedal steel. Released by the London label Loose Music on September 30, 2013, the album received generally positive reviews from the European press. In 2014, Rain Plans was released in the US by Loose Music through Nashville based label services company Thirty Tigers. It quickly became a favorite on NPR and several non-commercial radio stations such as KEXP in Seattle, WXPN in Philadelphia, KUTX in Austin, and The Current in Minneapolis-St. Paul. In January 2015, Israel Nash was featured on a session of World Cafe. Nash and his band recorded Silver Season on tape at Nash's Texas ranch in 2015 which was released October 2015 to critical acclaim. Classic Rock magazine considered it \\"even more exquisite\\" than Rain Plans. Q magazine highlighted its \\"subtly political messages\\", while Uncut called it \\"a terrific album\\". Mojo praised its \\"cosmic poetry, crunching guitars and swooning pedal steel\\". On November 4, 2016, Nash and The Bright Light Social Hour released the three-song collaborative EP Neighbors. The EP was recorded between the two bands' studios near Austin, and was released digitally and as a limited edition 7\\" vinyl record.

Kenan Jr. Distinguished Professor of Nutrition (as well as Carla Smith Chamblee Distinguished Professor of Global Nutrition) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health, where he is the director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Obesity. He developed the concept of \\"nutrition transition\\". He is the author of over 490 journal articles and a book, \\"The World is Fat\\". Early life and education Popkin was born in 1944 and grew up in Superior, Wisconsin; neither of his parents had a college education. Popkin describes the food he ate in Superior as \\"...typical of the way most Americans handled food in the first half of the 20th century.\\" He attended the University of Wisconsin, graduating in 1967. He spent the 1965-66 year in India living partly in a squatter area and partly at Delhi University. After which he spent one year doing graduate work at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1968, he returned to the University of Wisconsin, and received his MS from there one year later. After a period of civil rights work, he worked at the University of Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty for a year and then in 1972 moved to Boston to work. Then he began to work at Cornell University in the fall of 1972 and began his thesis work in Jan 1973. In July 1974, he received his PhD in agricultural economics from Cornell University. Career From 1971 to 1972 Popkin worked as a research economist at the Institute for Research in Poverty at the University of Wisconsin. From 1974 to 1976 Popkin was a visiting associate professor with the Rockefeller Foundation in Manila, Philippines. He joined UNC-Chapel Hill's faculty in 1977 and became the W.R. Kenan Jr. Distinguished Professor of Nutrition there in 2011. Research Popkin did extensive research from 1971 to the early 1980s on both hunger in America and around the world. He developed with Bob Evenson the Laguna Household Surveys and created the Bicol Multipurpose Survey while living in the Philippines and focused much of his attention there on women, work and the relationship of these activities to maternal and child health. He subsequently returned to the US and worked for a decade on maternal and child nutrition research, including initiating the Cebu Longitudinal Household Health and Nutrition Survey with two economics colleagues.Popkin's Curriculum Vitae He started the China Health and Nutrition Survey in the mid and late 1980s and it was out of this experience that he wrote a series of papers which created the concept of the nutrition transition. Much of his subsequent research globally has been on the transitions in the way we eat, drink and move and how the most recent stage of this transition has created in regions and countries throughout the globe many shifted toward increased obesity and related noncommunicable diseases and many adverse economic consequences. For many years he was writing and talking about this transition and it took a Bellagio conference he held in 2001 to convince leading scholars globally that low and middle income countries were going through this rapid shift toward a pattern of diet and activity linked with rapid shifts toward obesity. He also was the first author to identify along with coauthor Colleen Doak the double burden of malnutrition in a series of papers first published in 2000. He also published papers linking obesity and stunting first and this led to many others studying both concepts. He became very active in the obesity field. He was a co-author on a widely cited 2004 paper in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition which speculated that high fructose corn syrup-containing beverages may uniquely contribute to obesity. In his research, he shows how increasing access to media and exposure to advertising, a powerful food industry, the rise of Wal-Mart like shopping centers, and a dramatic decline in physical activity are clashing with millions of years of human evolution, creating a world of overweight people with debilitating health problems such as diabetes. Ultimately, Popkin contends that widespread obesity is less a result of poor individual dietary choices than about a hi-tech, interconnected world in which governments and multinational corporations have extraordinary power to shape our everyday lives. Popkin also conducted the China Health and Nutrition Survey, and has conducted other surveys in countries such as Russia, Kyrgyzstan, and the United Arab Emirates. He was a member of the G-7 small team of economists who worked in 1991 on working to help transform the Russia economy. Then he helped to create a new poverty line for Russia and also initiated the ongoing Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. Popkin was the chair of a committee of experts that published a report on the health effects of food deserts in 2009. They found that farmer's markets and supermarkets did not have a noticeable effect. He is currently leading a project whose goal is to determine the calorie and nutrient content of popular foods in the United States, or, as Popkin describes it, \\"mapping the food genome.\\" In 2014, Popkin et al. published a study in which the authors reported that fast food consumption was not the sole contributor to childhood obesity, and that Western diets in general might be more strongly associated with obesity than fast food consumption alone. Regarding this study, Popkin told the Winston-Salem Chronicle that \\"Eating fast foods is just one behavior that results from those poor eating habits. Just because children who eat more fast food are the most likely to become obese does not prove that calories from fast foods bear the brunt of the blame.\\" Another 2014 study led by Popkin found that as a result of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation Pledge, food companies sold about 6.4 trillion fewer calories in 2012 than they did in 2007. More recently he worked with the Mexican government on a number of panels and commissions related to creating a healthier diet and preventing increased obesity and diabetes. He is currently working with Mexican colleagues to evaluate rigorously the Mexican sugar- sweetened beverage and nonessential food taxes to learn how they impact food purchasing patterns and ultimately diet and health. He is working with a number of countries in Asia and Latin America on related large-scale activities to help reduce the risks of poor diets and obesity. His Global Food Research Program at UNC has been done in collaboration with Professors Shu Wen Ng and Lindsey Smith Taillie. Together they are working in a set of countries around the world in addition to Mexico on the design and evaluation and also research support for in-country research collaborators on policy advocacy. Those countries include Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Jamaica and Barbados. As part of an evaluation fund he leads, they are working with the Chilean government and colleagues at the Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology and the Chronicas group at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima. A large series of papers are being published by both in evaluation their unique large-scale obesity prevention regulatory programs. =Nutrition transition= The concept of nutrition transition, referring to the changes in diet in the Western world from high-fiber diets to those based on more processed foods containing more fat and sugar, was first proposed by Popkin in 1993.Nutritional Patterns and Transitions Since he proposed the concept, Popkin has published studies about the nutrition transition and its effects in the developing world, as well as in Brazil. Views In 2013, Popkin argued that smoothies are \\"the new danger\\" due to the large quantities of fructose they contain. He is also a critic of the soft drink industry. He has expressed strong support for soda taxes, and has compared them to existing taxes on tobacco. When several large beverage companies promised to reduce soda consumption in 2014, Popkin said this was merely an attempt to pass off already declining soda sales as an effort to combat obesity. In the past decade after he organized a bellagio conference on large-scale regulatory and fiscal options for addressing global obesity much of his energy has been working on regulatory options such as food labeling and marketing control in many countries(e.g. Chile), fiscal actions around SSB and other ultra- processed food taxes(e.g Mexico), and consulting with dozens of countries on such actions. The World is Fat In 2009, Popkin's book The World is Fat was published by Avery Publishing. In the book, Popkin contends that the rising rates of obesity around the world are due to several different factors, including globalization, technology, and the fact that people now eat more often and in more places than they did before. He also cites the fact that humans have a tendency to enjoy eating foods containing large amounts of sugar and fat as another contributor to the obesity epidemic. The book was described by Fuchsia Dunlop as \\"a concise, lucid overview of how the human diet has gone awry in the last half-century.\\" Personal life Popkin was a partner of Anne-Linda Furstenberg, a former professor of social work at UNC-Chapel Hill for 16 years, until she died in 2002. With a previous wife he had a son, Matt. He is currently a partner of Cay Stratton, formerly advisor to the UK government on youth and young adult employment and currently senior fellow at MDC, a nonprofit focusing on southern poverty issues.

By that time it had 56,000 members in lodes \\"from New England to the Gulf\\". Men and women were admitted. The Order paid sick and death benefits which in 1897 were $5 per day for sickness and $300 to $400 for death. Claimed to be of Masonic origin, and its emblem used a fish, cross, rose and the letters INRI, similar to the 18th degree in Scottish Rite Masonry.Stevens p.235 Local lodges were called \\"Tabernacles\\".Preuss p.93 cites cyclopedia 2nd ed. p.235; La France antimaçonique Vol. XXVII #28 p.329 July 10, 1913 Apparently active into the 1980s.Alan Axelrod, International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders.

W. B. Smith. It was an authorized branch of the white Grand United Order of Good Samaritans which had been founded that March. Had initiated over 400,000 members by 1897. It was described as having educational as well as mutual benefit aspects including sickness, death, disability and old age benefits. In 1897 the Order had lodges in every US state and England. Its logo was a dove and olive branch enclosed in a triangle with the words Love, Purity and Truth emblazoned on them. This symbolized perfection, equality and the trinity. The Orders headquarters were in Washington, DC.Stevens pp.402-3 * Independent Order of Immaculates of the United States of America - Founded June 23, 1872, in Nashville, Tennessee, by W. A. Hadley. Evolved from Young Men's Immaculate Association but was different in that it was patterned after secret fraternal orders and that it admitted men and women. Had about 5,000 members in 1897. Headquartered in Nashville.Stevens p.141 * Independent Order of Saint Luke - Based in Richmond, Virginia. Had 49,498 members at the end of 1921.Fraternal Monitor Vol. XXXII #8 March 1922 p.18 attempts to reach it in 1923 were unsuccessful.Preuss p.192 * International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor * Knights of Peter Claver - Founded in 1909 by members of Most Pure Heart of Mary Catholic Church in Mobile, Alabama, as a Black Catholic fraternal order, as Blacks were barred from the Knights of Columbus due to their race. Among the founders were The Rev. John H. Dorsey (the second Black Catholic priest ordained in the US), a number of White priests, and three Black parishioners. * Knights of Pythias of North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa ** Colored Knights of Pythias - Unclear if this was a separate group from above. * Mosaic Templars of America * Prince Hall Freemasonry * Supreme Camp of American Woodmen * United African Brotherhood - Organized in Clinton, Texas. Attempts to contact by mail in the late 1890s failed.Stevens p.192 * United Brothers of Friendship - Founded August 1, 1861, by young local students in day or night schools. In 1868, on the advice of their teacher, W.H. Gibson, the society reorganized. Many chapters were formed in Kentucky, and a statewide Grand Lodge was formed in 1871. After establishing chapters outside Kentucky a National Grand Lodge was formed. W.H. Gibson served as the first State Grand Master for five years, and as National Grand Master four years. Unofficial female auxiliaries called the Sisters of Friendship until 1878 when the organization formed the official Sisters of the Mysterious Ten, organized in local Temples. In 1878 the Order had about 4,000 members. That was the year they decided to establish another auxiliary, the Knights of Friendship, based on the story of David and Jonathan. In 1892 the UBF had 100,000 member in 19 states and 2 territories with 30,000 in Missouri alone. It was known to be active in Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia, the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Kansas, Colorado, Washington, Canada, the West Indies and Africa. While predominantly black, the order had white members. There was evidence that the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows had something to do with its founding.Stevens pp.288-9 * United Knights and Daughters of America - Headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Reportedly had many members in the Midwest. Attempts to contact the order in 1923 were unsuccessful.Preuss p.465 does not give any sources *Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League = American Indian = * Alaska Native Brotherhood * Brotherhood of North American Indians - Founded by Richard C. Adams of the Delaware Tribe of Oklahoma on December 5, 1911, in Washington, DC. Membership was open to people of Indian blood. Those married to Indians, the President of the United States, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and other public officials could become honorary members, without vote.

It was originally a Dutch title of nobility referring to the cities of Veere and Vlissingen, in the southwestern Netherlands. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V created the title in 1555 for his distant relative, Maximilian of Burgundy, who had by then ruled as Lord of Veere. After being held by the kings of Spain and England and claimed by the kings in Prussia, it definitively passed to the House of Orange-Nassau.  History  =Creation, sales and purchases = Maximilian of Burgundy The title was granted to Maximilian of Burgundy in recognition of his 25 years of loyal service to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, his distant relative. Maximilian was succeeded by his sister Anna's son, Maximilien de Hénin-Liétard. The new titleholder was heavily indebted and had to sell the marquisate. King Philip II of Spain, sovereign of the Netherlands, bought it in 1567. The marquisate, however, fell into arrears in its dues to the County of Zeeland (i.e., to Philip himself, as he was Count of Zeeland) due to the Dutch Revolt. In 1580, the Court of Holland and Zeeland ordered the marquisate to be sold publicly. William the Silent bought it in 1582, intending the marquisate for his second son, Maurice. Thus he also acquired two more votes in the States of Zeeland. = Inheritance disputes = William the Silent's last patrilineal descendant was King William III of England, who died in 1702. King Frederick I of Prussia and Prince John William Friso of Orange-Dietz, both cognatic first cousins of William III and great-grandsons of William the Silent, claimed the inheritance. Frederick thought himself the heir general but John William Friso was the designated heir in William III's will. Upon William III's death, the States of Zeeland refused to recognise John William Friso as Marquis of Veere and Flushing, on the grounds of his minority. In reality, they were eager to prevent anyone from ever again seizing all the power and influence that the title carried. In 1703, a group of Zeelanders took the advantage of the internal unrest and conspired to grant the marquisate to King Frederick. The States of Zeeland were informed of the conspiracy and the plan failed. Prince John William Friso struggled to obtain the marquisate until he drowned in 1711; his widow, Landgravine Marie Louise of Hesse-Kassel, then took up the cause in the name of their son, Prince William IV of Orange, who was born six weeks after his father's death. The family sought support not only from the government of Zeeland but also from the governments of the rest of the Seven Provinces. The latter were not inclined to interfere with Zeeland's internal affairs. In 1722, the government of Zeeland was so eager to prevent William from becoming stadtholder that it started considering abolition of the marquisate. His mother and maternal grandfather, Landgrave Charles I of Hesse-Kassel, protested in vain to the States-General, executors of William III's will. = Abolitions and restorations = William IV of Orange The abolition was delayed for a decade, and was only done when William IV's long dispute with King Frederick William I of Prussia over William III's inheritance came to end in 1732. According to the agreement, William IV was awarded the marquisate, but the States promptly reacted and voted \\"by virtue of their sovereignty and indisputable power to relieve these cities of their vassalage forever.\\" William was outraged and refused to accept the sum of 250,000 guilders as compensation for his lost property. He was urged to agree to a compromise whereby he would be granted the marquisate as a fief of Zeeland, rather than as freehold, but did not comply. William argued that, if the marquisate was not his property, he did not understand why he was offered money for it; if it was his property, he asserted that it was not for sale. The government claimed that the marquisate was being expropriated. In 1743, the desperate Prince William IV asked his father-in-law, King George II of Great Britain, to write a compelling letter to the States-General and threaten them with seizing Zeeland's merchants if they refused to acknowledge him as Marquis of Veere and Flushing. William, however, did not tell his father-in-law and the British ministers that the marquisate had been abolished decades ago. Angered and embarrassed, they refused to meddle with the Dutch Republic's internal politics on William's behalf ever again. The marquisate was finally restored in 1748, when William IV managed to establish himself as stadtholder of all the Dutch provinces. It was abolished once again when the Dutch Republic was replaced with the Batavian Republic in 1795, only to be restored for the second time in 1814. Since then, it has been held by the kings and queens of the Netherlands, as one of many titles borne by the monarchs. The present holder of the title Marquis of Veere is King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.

Her studies in the fine arts in UCLA (University California Los Angeles) were guided by teachers who were prominent artists of the 1960s Post-Modernist period such as Robert Heinecken and Jan Stüssy. In UCLA, Lui experimented with drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpting and photography. She further deepened her art studies at the prestigious Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. Her graduation project combined printing processes such as photogravure and platinum/palladium printing in order to create subtle black and white portraits taken with an 8x10 inch view camera. Lui was able to successfully master these alternative printing processes thanks to her teacher Anthony Zepeda, Los Angeles master printmaker, a former printer of Rauschenberg's.Bowne, Kristine. \\"Diana Lui: Soul to Soul\\" , Outer Circle, Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, California, Fall 2007.

The Battle of Manila of 1896 (Filipino: Labanan sa Maynila; ) occurred in Manila in then Spanish colony of the Philippines during the Philippine Revolution. Katipunan under Andres Bonifacio attempted to take the city but the attempt failed, and Bonifacio retreated to the city's outskirts. The Battle of San Juan del Monte was joined a day later when Bonifacio attempted to capture the San Juan's powder magazine, but this too failed.  Bonifacio's plan  Since the start of the revolution, the city of Manila, and specifically its walled center Intramuros, was the primary target of El Supremo Andres Bonifacio and his Katipuneros. The take over of Intramuros had been a logical move for any uprising trying to overthrow the Spanish colonial regime in the Philippines. In this area were the Ayuntamiento (City Hall), Intendencia, and Palacio Arzobispal (Archbishop's Palace). The seat of the Governor-General was in Malacañang Palace, 300 paces from Intramuros. Very few Spanish troops guarded the city, as most were garrisoned around the archipelago. Bonifacio thought that once the city was taken the revolutionaries would be welcomed by the inhabitants, who he thought were already sick of Spanish domination. Bonifacio intended to take the city by force in a three-pronged attack.Alvarez, S.V., 1992, Recalling the Revolution, Madison: Center for Southeast Asia Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison, The forces of General Aguedo del Rosario would come from Tondo, Manila, those of General Vicente Fernandez from San Marcelino, and those of General Ramon Bernardo through the Rotonda in Sampaloc, Manila. General Fernandez was to take over La Electricista de Manila (Manila electric plant) in Quiapo and cut the electrical supply to Manila, which would be the signal for the others to attack. Once Manila was thrown to darkness, the plan was to lure the Spanish troops from Intramuros towards vital water installations in Rotonda in Sampaloc, El Deposito in San Juan del Monte, the Balara filter station, and the Marikina main water supply. These installations were threatened to be sabotaged by the Katipunan revolutionaries. The Spanish troops would be engaged by General Bernardo forces. Forces in Cavite under Emilio Aguinaldo, together with those under General del Rosario, would then attack Intramuros which would be lacking troops for defense. These forces attacking Intramuros would be helped by revolutionaries that infiltrated into Regiment 70 (Regimiento de Magallanes numero 70), the only regiment concentrated for the defense of Manila as well as the rest of Luzon. The regiment numbered around 2,300 troops in Manila, of which more than 85% were composed of native integrees. Also according to plan, the Katipuneros would be spreading false news to create confusion among the Manila population. Rumors would include a Japanese take over of Manila, or the Japanese ordering the native revolutionaries to occupy Manila for them.  Battle  Before the plan was to be put to action one Katipunan member Teodoro Patiño, known for his talkativeness, revealed the existence of the revolutionary organization to a Spanish priest named Mariano Gil, who then reported it to the local authorities as revenge for grave misunderstandings with fellow Katipunero Apolonio de la Cruz. As a result, the Spanish troops were warned of the attack and forced the Katipunan from the city. Protracted warfare soon escalated, with the battles of Pasong Tamo (August 28–29, 1896) and of San Juan del Monte (August 30, 1896). Overall, the attack on Manila did not take place as Bonifacio planned. General Fernandez failed to launch the signal from the electric plant. The Katipuneros did not even reach the plant. Without the signal to coordinate the attack, the revolutionaries in Manila and Cavite went on their own battles. Despite this lack of coordination and contact among forces, Bonifacio commanding some 800 (or according to the Spanish, 300) still led the attack on Manila. His force was repulsed after the Battle of San Juan del Monte. Following Bonifacio's failed attempt in San Juan, Katipuneros in the area, particularly in the towns of Pasig, Pateros, Santa Ana, Tagig, Kalookan, San Pedro de Macati and Mandaluyong began simultaneous attacks on Spanish installments. Majority of these attacks failed due to the Katipuneros' lack of arms. The most successful uprising was led by the Pasig Katipuneros under Valentin Cruz. On Saturday, August 29, some 2,000 Pasiguenos met at the border of barrios Maybunga and Caniogan, marched towards the plaza, and took over the headquarters of the Guardia Civil and the municipal hall. This event is now commemorated as \\"Nagsabado sa Pasig\\". Other notable uprisings occurred outside of Manila in the eight surrounding provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Bulacan, Province of Manila, Tarlac, Pampanga, Batangas and Nueva Ecija. The eight rays on the Philippine flag represent these first 8 provinces, put under Martial law by Governor-General Ramon Blanco.  Aftermath  Bonifacio had sparked an uprising bigger than any other previous uprising in the Tagalog-Pampango provinces. His \\"Revolt of the Masses\\" inspired more Filipinos to begin their struggle for freedom from Spain. This revolt in Manila, though only lasting a week before Bonifacio and his men were reduced to guerilla warfare, led to the arrests and executions of thousands of upper-class Filipinos who were suspected of having Katipunan ties. Bagumbayan, now known as Luneta, became a killing field, culminating in the execution of José Rizal at the park in December, 1896. Emilio Aguinaldo would use the same plan when revolutionary forces surrounded Manila from four fronts in June 1898 during the Spanish–American War. This planned attack also did not take place, due to the takeover of Manila by the Americans during the Battle of Manila of 1898.

A joint venture between the German company Rhein-Flugzeugbau (RFB) and the American general aviation manufacturer Grumman American, two examples were built, but no production followed. Design and development In the 1960s, Hanno Fischer, Technical Director of Rhein-Flugzeugbau (RFB), developed an interest in aircraft powered by ducted fans integrated into the aircraft structure, flying two modified gliders as testbeds, a VFW-Fokker FK-3 fitted with an eight-bladed ducted fan in the rear fuselage, which flew as the Sirius I in 1969, and a Caproni Vizzola Calif A-21, which flew as the Sirius II on 16 December 1971. Based on the successful results of testing of these aircraft, RFB decided to start work on a two-seat ducted-fan military trainer, intended to offer jet-like handling at low cost, which became the RFB Fantrainer, while in 1972, RFB began studies on a two-seat light touring aircraft with side-by- side seating.Air International February 1977, p. 60.Fricker Air International February 1986, pp. 70–71. While early interest in the Fantrainer was limited, RFB concentrated on the light tourer, which was named the Fanliner, with the intention that it would be able to act as a testbed for ducted fan installations for the Fantrainer as well as a prospective production aircraft in its own right. RFB entered into a joint venture with Grumman American to develop the Fanliner, allowing the use of components from existing Grumman American light planes. The first prototype Fanliner made its maiden flight on 8 October 1973. It was a mid-winged monoplane of all-metal construction with a fixed nosewheel undercarriage. The crew of two sat side by side in an enclosed cockpit which hinged on the centreline in a gull-wing door arrangement to give access. Dual controls were fitted. The engine, an water-cooled Audi NSU wankel engine was positioned behind the cockpit, and drove the ducted fan situated behind the engine. The radiator for the engine was fitted in the aircraft's nose. The rear fuselage, which carried a T-tail, consisted of a narrow boom extended behind the fan duct, supported by triangular-section beams in a cruciform arrangement. The aircraft's wings and horizontal tail surfaces were taken from a Grumman American AA-1, while the vertical tail surfaces were new.Air International February 1977, pp. 62–63. At first the fan was ungeared, which resulted in high noise levels. The engine was replaced by a engine in 1974, and considerable testing was carried out with various designs of fans and reduction gearing in order to reduce the noise to acceptable levels. The use of a three-bladed fiberglass fan, with swept blades driven via a gearbox allowed noise levels to be reduced to well below the German statutory limits for light aircraft.Lambert Flight International 26 February 1977, p. 477. The first prototype Fanliner, D-EJFL with makers number 001, was exhibited at the June 1975 Paris Air Show. The second Fanliner with revised cockpit glazing and other changes exhibited at the 1977 Paris Air Show A second, pre-production, aircraft registered D-EBFL, flew on 4 September 1976. It was exhibited at the June 1977 Paris Air Show. This used the wings and horizontal tail from a Grumman American AA-5 had a redesigned, more streamlined fuselage (industrial designer Luigi Colani was involved in redesigning the fuselage) and was fitted with a engine with radiators moved to behind the cabin.Air International February 1977, pp. 63–64. Wingspan of the second prototype was , while it demonstrated a speed of and a climb rate of 5.5 m/s (1,080 ft/min).Lambert Flight International 26 February 1977, p. 479. No production followed, as RFB decided to concentrate on the military Fantrainer, which had gained priority following the receipt of a contract for two prototypes from the German Federal Ministry of Defence, although the Fanliners did provide useful development data for the Fantrainer's ducted fan.Fricker 1976, p. 71.

It was created in 1969 and is part of the cultural center where the headquarters of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Gulbenkian Museum and the José de Azeredo Perdigão Modern Art Centre are situated enriching the cultural importance of the garden. The park is spread over an area of and has one large and another small lake within it. History The park was inaugurated in 1969. It was the parkland of the former Palacio Azambuja or dos Meninos de Palhavã in 1918 and the Spanish Embassy used to be located here. The park was sold in 1957. The park was designed by the landscape architects Gonçalo Ribeiro Telles and António Viana Barreiro in close collaboration with Alberto Pessoa, Pedro Cid and Ruy Athouguia who were architects of the buildings of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation erected in the park; Armenian oil tycoon and art collector Calouste Gulbenkian played an important role in the post-war cultural life of Lisbon. Its gardens are pleasant and the art center is contemporary. Features A mallard in the park The lawns have been tended to fit the natural landscape right up to the central lake. The stream inlets in the park are crossed by small bridges, and paths are well laid out to stroll around. Irises and waterside marginals are planted along the course of the streams. The land area has been modified to build not only the structures but also create a lake environment. The floral collection planted in the park has been done very selectively with well laid footpaths to stroll through the gardens. The natural vegetation chosen consists of feathery pampas grass, Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolia) tree with small leaves, ribbon gum, Turkey oak, eucalyptus and poplars. There is also rose garden within the park. Animal sculpture in the park Of the two lakes built in the garden, the larger lake, located in the centre of the park, is the habitat for water birds such as mallard, moorhen, ring-necked parakeet, white wagtail, wren, blackbird, blackcap, house sparrow, serin, and greenfinch. In view of thick bushes around the lake, the park is a preferred location for moorhens to breed. The small lake is also a habitat for water birds. The garden also has an open-air amphitheater to seat 1,000 people which has the lake as its backdrop. The amphitheater is the venue for holding many programmes on dance, drama, and music. Jazz music programme is held in the gardens every year during first two weeks of August. The park is also enlivened with statues and sculptures made by national and international artists which are fixed strategically at many places.

According to commentators of her time, she was described as a true mezzo-soprano rather than a contralto. She had a wide range of comic, dramatic and travesty roles in her theatrical career developed in Paris, London, Moscow and Madrid. Career Nantier-Didiée was born in Saint-Denis, Réunion. She studied with Gilbert Duprez at the Conservatoire de Paris, winning the first prize at opera in 1849. The following year she debuted in Turin, as Emilia in Saverio Mercadante's La vestale. Three years later, she appeared in Luisa Miller in Paris at the Théâtre-Italien, being hired the following year for three seasons at the Covent Garden, where he sang in the premieres of Rigoletto and Benvenuto Cellini on 2 July 1853.

In the more arid parts of Chile droughts are produced when there are low amounts of snow accumulation in the Andes. Chilean coastal basins without snow accumulation are particularly vulnerable to drought. The territory of Central Chile has been affected by long-term droughts in 1280–1450, 1570–1650 and 1770–1820. Historical droughts San Carlos Canal in picture begun to be built in 1772 in response to years of drought. =Drought of 1770–82= The 1770–1782 period was one of general drought in Central Chile with a total of three non- consecutive years of extreme drought. In 1772 vineyards and cropfields along Mapocho River in Santiago could not be irrigated.Urrutia & Lanza 1993, pp. 67-68. This drought led the authorities to begin the construction of the long- planned San Carlos Canal in 1772 to deviate waters from Maipo River to Mapocho River. =Drought of 1924= In 1924 a drought spread between Coquimbo and Maule Region.Urrutia & Lanza 1993, pp. 201-203. In Coquimbo Region (at the time known as Province of Coquimbo) 70% of the wheat from non-irrigated land was lost while in irrigated areas the harvest loss was of 20%. The price of railroad transport of livestock to places south of Curicó was lowered by 40% as there was hardly any grass or plant buds for livestock to eat in Norte Chico. Rural people in Coquimbo Region flocked around the towns of Illapel, Combarbalá and Ovalle. Later the intendant of Coquimbo claimed that about hundred people had left the province as result of the drought. =Great Drought of 1968–69= The drought faced by Chile between 1968 and 1969, known as the Great Drought of 1968, was one of the largest rainfall deficits in the country during the twentieth century, only comparable to the drought of 1924. The drought had its origin in the low amounts of precipitation that fell in 1967.Urrutia & Lanza 1993, pp. 337-340. The area affected by the drought spanned from Atacama Region in the north to Ñuble Province in the south. The drought created huge losses for cultivations of potato, rice, maize, beans. Fruit trees and vineyards were also affected. 100 thousand cattle and 1 million sheep died because of the drought. Milk, meat and wool output declined. By September 1969 only 250 thousand goats remained from an earlier population of 650 thousand. Throughout rural Norte Chico, many farmers and communities came to lack water even for human consumption. In 1969 farmers received support of several financial institutions and state agencies including tax exemptions and a line of credit to buy forage. In Central Chile, typical river flow increases in December, but this did not happen in 1968. Chile many farmers decided to not cultivate in early summer due to this and to the known fact there was almost no snow in Andes. Later in summer the rivers did grow due to glacier ablation, causing many farmers to repent albeit it was too late to cultivate. The decline in hydroelectric power generation (The hydroelectric deficit was of 200 MW) was partly compensated by having the thermoelectric plants of Ventanas, Renca and Laguna Verde function at maximum capacity. National coal production from the Lota-Schwager mine was not enough to supply the need and the government authorized the import of 50 thousand tons of coal from the United States, Poland, France and Germany. In the hydrological year of 1969–1970 the area affected by the drought diminished from previously spanning the latitudes of 27–37° S to 27–33° S. =Drought of 1998–99= Beginning in December 1996 the El Niño phenomenon affected Chile during 14 months until 1998. Sea temperatures were high in the Pacific. The drought of 1998–99 caused an energy shortage in SIC, Chile's main power grid. The energy shortage was worsened by problems in the Nehuenco Power Plant driven by natural gas. Annual rainfall in Zona Sur was far below previous record lows: in Valdivia only fell and in Concepción just , whereas the lowest before 1996 had been in 1924.

In condensed matter physics, an Arrott plot is a plot of the square of the magnetization M^2 of a substance, against the ratio of the applied magnetic field to magnetization H/M at one (or several) fixed temperature(s). Arrott plots are an easy way of determining the presence of ferromagnetic order in a material. They are named after American physicist Anthony Arrott who introduced them as a technique for studying magnetism in 1957. Details According to the Ginzburg–Landau mean field picture for magnetism, the free energy of a ferromagnetic material close to a phase transition can be written as: F(M)=-H M+a\\\\frac{T-T_c}{T_c} M^2+bM^4+\\\\ldots where M, the magnetization, is the order parameter, H is the applied magnetic field, T_c is the critical temperature, and a,b are material constants. Close to the phase transition, this gives a relation for the magnetization order parameter: M^2=\\\\frac{1}{4b}\\\\frac{H}{M}-\\\\frac{a}{2b}\\\\epsilon where \\\\epsilon=\\\\frac{T-T_c}{T_c} is a dimensionless measure of the temperature. Thus in a graph plotting M^2 vs. H/M for various temperatures, the line without an intercept corresponds to the dependence at the critical temperature. Thus along with providing evidence for the existence of a ferromagnetic phase, the Arrott plot can also be used to determine the critical temperature for the phase transition.

The war caused significant panic in Latin America over economics as a large portions of economy of the region depended on the European investment capital, which was shut down. Latin America tried to stay neutral but the warring countries were endangering their neutrality. Most countries used propaganda to turn the neutral countries to their side, while Berlin wanted Latin America neutral. In order to better protect the Panama Canal, combat Axis influence, and optimize the production of goods for the war effort, the United States through Lend-Lease and similar programs greatly expanded its interests in Latin America, resulting in large- scale modernization and a major economic boost for the countries that participated. Strategically, Panama was the most important Latin American nation for the Allies because of the Panama Canal, which provided a link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that was vital to both commerce and defense. Brazil was also of great importance because of its having the closest point in the Americas to Africa where the Allies were actively engaged in fighting the Germans and Italians. For the Axis, the Southern Cone nations of Argentina and Chile were where they found most of their support, and they utilized it to the fullest by interfering with internal affairs, conducting espionage, and distributing propaganda. Brazil was the only country to send troops to the European Theater; however, several countries had skirmishes with German U-Boats and cruisers in the Caribbean and South Atlantic. Mexico sent a fighter squadron of 300 volunteers to the Pacific, the Escuadrón 201, known as the Aztec Eagles (Águilas Aztecas). The Brazilian active participation on the battlefield in Europe was divined after the Casablanca Conference. The President of the U.S., Franklin D. Roosevelt on his way back from Morocco met the President of Brazil, Getulio Vargas, in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, this meeting is known as the Potenji River Conference, and defined the creation of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. History =United States role= In 1940, after he expressed his concern to President Franklin D. Roosevelt over Nazi influence in Latin America, Nelson Rockefeller of the famous family was appointed to the new position of Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (CIAA) in the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA).Cary Reich, The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller: Worlds to Conquer, 1908-1958 (1996), pp 260-373; the standard scholarly biography;Cramer, Gisela; Prutsch, Ursula, \\"Nelson A. Rockefeller's Office of Inter-American Affairs (1940–1946) and Record Group 229\\", Hispanic American Historical Review 2006 86(4):785–806; . Rockefeller was charged with overseeing a program of U.S. cooperation with the nations of Latin America to help raise the standard of living, to achieve better relations among the nations of the western hemisphere, and to counter rising Nazi influence in the region. He facilitated this form of cultural diplomacy by collaborating with the Director of Latin American Relations at the CBS radio network Edmund A. Chester.Time, June 1, 1942 Anti-fascist propaganda was a major U.S. project across Latin America, and was run by Rockefeller's office. It spent millions on radio broadcasts and motion pictures, hoping to reach a large audience. Madison Avenue techniques generated a push back in Mexico, especially, where well-informed locals resisted heavy-handed American influence.Kornel Chang, \\"Muted reception: US propaganda and the construction of Mexican popular opinion during the Second World War.\\" Diplomatic History 38.3 (2013): 569-598. Nevertheless, Mexico was a valuable ally in the war. A deal was reached whereby 250,000 Mexican citizens living in the United States served in the American forces; over 1000 were killed in combat. In addition to propaganda, large sums were allocated for economic support and development. On the whole the Roosevelt policy was a political success, except in Argentina, which tolerated German influence, and refused to follow Washington's lead until the war was practically over.Reich, pp 270-75, 305-17.Randall B. Woods, \\"Hull and Argentina: Wilsonian Diplomacy in the Age of Roosevelt\\" Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs 16#3 (1974) pp. 350-371 online =Economics= According to author Thomas M. Leonard, World War II had a major impact on Latin American economies. Many countries were raising prices on their exports so that they could support themselves economically. Following the December 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, most of Latin America either severed relations with the Axis powers or declared war on them. As a result, many nations (including all of Central America, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Venezuela) suddenly found that they were now dependent on the United States for trade. The United States' high demand for particular products and commodities during the war further distorted trade. For example, the United States wanted all of the platinum produced in Colombia, all of Chile's copper, and all of Peru's cotton. The parties agreed upon set prices, often with a high premium, but the various nations lost their ability to bargain and trade in the open market. Shortages of consumer goods and other products were also a problem during the war years. The demands of the American war industry and a scarcity of shipping caused many goods to be unavailable in Latin America, and so the prices for what was available increased. Gasoline and other oil products were expensive and difficult to obtain. Food shortages were a problem in the cities. Ultimately, all of these factors resulted in inflation. Most of Latin America used the war to their advantage by siding with the United States and receiving aid. Peru, however, was an exception. In Peru, the government placed price controls on various products; hence, its foreign reserves did not increase as much as some of the other Latin American states and it lost badly- needed capital. Argentina, despite its pro-German leanings and its hostility toward the United States, did very well as trade increased rapidly. Panama also benefited economically, mainly because of increased ship traffic and goods passing through the canal. In Puerto Rico, the alcohol industry boomed because access to European markets ceased. Petroleum-rich Mexico and Venezuela benefitted from the elevated price of oil. Mexico used this commodity to force a deal on its terms with American and European oil companies for the nationalization of its oil industry in 1938. Furthermore, during the war President Manuel Ávila Camacho capitalized on the situation to improve Mexico's bargaining position with the United States. =Lend-Lease= On March 22, 1941, the United States government enacted Lend-Lease, which was a program which gave war materials and other assistance from the United States in exchange for military bases and participation in the defense of the Western Hemisphere. The United Kingdom and other European nations, including their colonies, logically received the majority of the aid, because the chaos of war was much closer to them. Latin America, however, received approximately $400 million in war materials, which was a small fraction compared with what was distributed to the European nations. Out of all of the Latin American nations, Brazil benefited the most from Lend-Lease during the war, mainly because of its geographical position at the northeastern corner of South America, which allowed for patrolling between South America and West Africa, as well as providing a ferry point for the transfer of American-made war materials to the Allies fighting in North Africa, but also because it was seen as a possible German invasion route that had to be defended. New and favorable trade treaties were signed with the United States, which offered loans and military aid, but of more importance was the drop in competition in Brazil's manufacturing industry. Brazil received three-quarters of the Lend-Lease assistance distributed in Latin America. Ecuador received some, mainly for the building of an airbase in the Galapagos, and both Colombia and the Dominican Republic used Lend-Lease to modernize their militaries in exchange for their participation in the defense of the Panama Canal and the Caribbean sea lanes. In contrast, Argentina and Chile received very little military aid, because for most of the war neither would heed American demands that they sever all relations with the Axis powers. Peru received some aid, but by 1943 the western coast of South America had lost all strategic significance, because it was so far away from the main theaters of war, and thus Peru lost its immediate justification for Lend-Lease weaponry. The Central American nations suffered a similar fate as Peru. By 1943, the Pan-American Highway, which the United States was building for defense purposes, ceased to be a priority, and so work on the road, as well as military aid, was halted. According to Leonard, Lend-Lease changed the balance of power in Latin America and \\"rekindled old rivalries.\\" The Chilean government, for example, was very concerned about its lack of military assistance, not out of fear of an attack by Axis forces, but because it was concerned that Bolivia and Peru might attempt to use their newly acquired weapons to take back territory lost to Chile sixty years before during the War of the Pacific. Ecuador also was weary because, at the end of the 1941 Ecuadorian–Peruvian War, it had lost to Peru. Finally, Argentina was threatened by its old rival, Brazil, because of the latter's access to modern American weaponry. Leonard says that the Argentine dictator Juan Perón came to power partially by claiming that he would \\"redress this change in military status.\\" =Axis activity= A German Junkers Ju 52/3m, which was confiscated by Peru and transferred to the United States Army Air Forces as a war prize, at Howard Field, Panama, in late 1942. At the beginning of World War II, fascism was seen as a positive alternative by some Latin American leaders and groups that were impressed by Germany's Adolf Hitler, Italy's Benito Mussolini, Japan's Emperor Hirohito, Spain's Francisco Franco (even though Spain remained neutral throughout the war) and the fascist dictators of the minor Axis Powers. President Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, for example, admired Hitler for his style and his militaristic rallies. Similar views were held by Jorge Ubico and Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, the dictators of Guatemala and El Salvador, respectively. According to Leonard, in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, the strong sense of unity and purpose created by fascism was quite attractive. All three nations had an influential fascist political party . Brazil's Integralists dressed in jackboots and green military-style shirts, and were open admirers of Mussolini. In the pre-war years the Germans also enjoyed growing economic penetration using strict binational trade agreements to ensure that the economic relationship with various Latin American nations would be equal. Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic all had trade agreements with Nazi Germany. Brazil's trade with Germany, for example, doubled between 1933, when Hitler came to power, and 1938, the year before the war began. With the start of the war in September 1939, Axis ships could no longer cross the Atlantic for commerce, and so trade between Latin America and Germany and Italy ceased. Losing trading partners hurt some of the Latin American states, and in most cases the United States was the only country that was able to replace the Germans and Italians. Almost all of the Latin American states had to respond to Axis espionage activity. Mexico, and to a lesser extent Brazil, cooperated with the United States in shutting down Axis cells. Chile and Argentina, on the other hand, allowed enemy agents to operate in their countries for most of the war, which was a source of considerable discord between the two nations and the United States. Many of the Latin American states also had to deal with large numbers of immigrants from Axis countries. Colombia, for example, had a population of about 4,000 German immigrants in 1941, as well as a small village of Japanese farmers in Cauca. Many of the Germans in Colombia were involved in the air transportation industry as employees of SCADTA, so the United States was concerned that they might be engaged in espionage or even plot to convert civilian aircraft into bombers for an attack against the Panama Canal. As a result, the United States government pressured Colombia into monitoring and interning the immigrants or, in some cases, deporting them to the United States. The same occurred in other Latin American countries as well. The threat of German and Spanish espionage was much more real. Throughout much of the war, the Germans operated spy networks in all of the most prominent countries of the region, including Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, and others. Operation Bolivar, as it was called, was centered on clandestine radio communications from their base in Argentina to Berlin in Germany, but it also utilized Spanish merchant vessels for the shipment of paper-form intelligence back to Europe. The latter was possible because of Spanish cooperation with German intelligence agencies during the war. Although Argentina and Chile eventually \\"cracked down\\" on the Axis agents operating in their countries in early 1944, some Bolivar activity continued up until the end of the European war in May 1945. In addition to German espionage and sabotage in Latin America, the United States was also concerned about Nazi propaganda. For example, Germany's embassy in Guatemala City served as the distribution center for Nazi propaganda in Central America. Prior to the beginning of the war in 1939, the propaganda focused on the superiority of German manufactured goods, and claimed that Germany was the center for scientific research, because it had the \\"world's most advanced educational system.\\" Between September 1939 and late 1943, the propaganda focused on German victories and the superiority of its military equipment. From Guatemala the propaganda made its way to the German embassies in other countries, often as packages aboard the Salvadoran airline TACA. =Soviet-Latin American relations= Hitler's invasion of June 1941 provoked support and aid for the Soviet Union in many countries in Latin America, generally organized through voluntary organizations or trade unions. Cuba dispatched 40,000 cigars to the Red Army and in October 1942 became the first Latin American country to extend diplomatic recognition to the USSR. The war led to a diplomatic thaw more generally: by 1945, 11 Latin American states, including Colombia, Chile, Argentina and the Central American republics, had normalized relations with Moscow. At the end of World War II in Europe, Mexican president Manuel Ávila Camacho declared: \\"Al enterarme del retroceso definitivo del Ejército alemán recuerdo junto con mi país los esfuerzos admirables del heroico pueblo soviético durante los años de la lucha contra las tropas fascistas.\\" (Upon hearing of the final defeat of the German army, I, along with my country, remembered the admirable efforts of the heroic Soviet people during the years of struggle against fascist troops.) =Jewish Passports-El Salvador= While Jews were trying to escape exile in The Axis powers, Colonel José Castellanos Contreras, the Salvadoran Consul General in Geneva, Switzerland, saved 25,000 Jews by providing them with Salvadoran passports which could be used as a form of political asylum. This was however a very quiet and unrecognized part of El Salvador contribution in World War 2.Call to honour El Salvador's rescuer of Jews after war role rediscovered, Rory Carroll, June 2008, The Guardian, retrieved 8 April 2015 Gallery File:Nazi-insurrection-chile.jpgNational police escorting members of the National Socialist Movement of Chile during the Seguro Obrero Uprising.

The call for protests had started in early July following and inspired by the Egyptian Tamarod Movement that led to the removal of President Mohamed Morsi. Calling for a \\"free and democratic Bahrain\\", Tamarod activists, who mobilized social networking websites, said their movement was peaceful, national and non-sectarian. They called for gradual peaceful civil disobedience starting from 14 August. The movement gained the support of opposition societies and human rights activists, including those languishing in prison. The government however, repeatedly warned against the protests, promising those who participate with legal action and forceful confrontation. Rights activists and media reported that authorities had stepped up their crackdown campaigns in the weeks leading to the protests. In late July, the king called for a parliamentary special session. The pro-government parliament submitted 22 recommendations, some of them calling for stripping those convicted of \\"terrorist crimes\\" from their nationality and banning of almost all protests in the capital, Manama. Despite outcries from the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the king endorsed the recommendations and issued two decrees to their effect. The Prime Minister asked his ministers to carry out the recommendations immediately and issued several warnings against protests. In the following days, the government arrested three photographers, two bloggers, a lawyer and a politician, and prevented human rights activists and journalists from entering the country, deported an American teacher and reportedly encircled entire areas with barbed wire. The government denied arrests had targeted activists. A few days before 14 August, activists said they had gathered tens of thousands of signatures in support of highly anticipated protests. The day of 14 August witnessed heavy deployment of security forces, which used tear gas and birdshot against hundreds-to-thousands of protesters who gathered in several locations throughout the country. Many shops were closed in response to Tamarod's call for a general strike. Opposition activists and media reported over 60 demonstrations throughout the country. The opposition and several citizens accused authorities of cutting Internet connections. The government blocked a website covering the protests, but activists and citizen journalists provided live coverage on social media websites, and Anonymous targeted a government website. At least twenty protesters were arrested and ten injured, two critically, activists said. The tightened security measures have succeeded in preventing large-scale protests in Manama. On 15 and 16 August, smaller protests occurred in several locations which police dispersed without injuries. Tamarod and Al Wefaq opposition society praised the protests and said they were successful. The government of Bahrain however said protests did not affect everyday life. The United States said it supported freedom of expression and assembly, and voiced its concern at the chances of violence. Analysts were divided between those who expected protests to be huge and those that did not see them having any chance. They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama, some blaming it on the security forces, others on protest organizers. Background Protests at Pearl Roundabout in February 2011 Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw sustained pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in the capital of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured. In March, martial law was declared and Saudi troops were called in. Despite the hard crackdown and official ban, the protests continued. According to the International Federation for Human Rights, at least 80 people were killed during the unrest. Calls for a rebellion Inspired by the Egyptian Tamarod Movement that led to the removal of President Mohamed Morsi, Bahraini opposition activists formed Bahrain Rebellion Movement on 3 July 2013 and called for mass protests starting on 14 August, the forty-second anniversary of Bahrain Independence Day under the banner Bahrain Tamarod. The day also marked the two-and-a-half-year anniversary of the Bahraini uprising. The movement which is also known as the August 14 Rebellion, identified itself as \\"a movement calling for awareness, nationalism, sovereignty, independence and legitimacy, with a message of love, loyalty and dedication to all of the Bahraini people in rebellion against the authorities.\\" One of its members said they were a youth movement, not a political party. A Reuters article described Tamarod as \\"a loose grouping of opposition activists who came together in early July to push for a 'free and democratic Bahrain' through mass anti- government demonstrations\\". Activists mobilized social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter to campaign for the protest movement. They issued their first statement on 4 July titled \\"Bahrain has Risen up\\" and \\"The August 14 Rebels\\" describing their goals and reasons. \\"[The people of Bahrain want] a nation that embraces all its citizens. We want a Bahrain to which we can all belong ... This movement is for freedom, for which Bahrainis have long yearned and made great sacrifices over many decades of struggle.\\" The statement also accused authorities of confiscating the people's values and rights, and \\"restrict[ing] their movement and activities.\\" In an interview with France 24, Hussain Yousif, a member of the Bahrain Rebellion Movement said the movement will employ all types of peaceful civil resistance including the call for a gradual civil disobedience starting on 14 August with abstaining from shopping, commercial and government transactions such as paying electricity bills. He highlighted the royal family's almost complete monopoly on power, the political stalemate and ongoing human rights violations as main motivations. Yousif added that the main principles of the movement were peacefulness, non-exclusion and recognizing the people's right to self- determination, and called the authorities to understand their demands and refrain from using violence against protesters. \\"We use pure national slogans, not belonging to any specific sect or ideology,\\" he said. The Christian Science Monitor said the 14 August protests were \\"the latest installment of a two-year long protest movement.\\" Protests were planned to last for three days. Left without an epicenter after the destruction of Pearl Roundabout in 2011, Tamarod announced their plans to stage peaceful protests in nine different locations, all in the streets, with the largest expected in Manama. One of the protests was planned near the U.S. embassy, a country that protest organizers had called on to use its influence to prevent government crackdown and protect demonstrations, which they said was an \\"ethical responsibility\\" for the U.S. \\"We hope that you may convey our deep concern to the US State Department and the US Congress to exert a real political pressure on Bahraini regime to avoid any fatal crackdown and bloodshed,\\" they said in an open letter. Events leading to the protests Soon after Tamarod's first statement, the Haq Movement for Liberty and Democracy announced its support for protest plans. \\"Let August 14 be the day of rebellion against the ruling gang in Bahrain,\\" the movement said in a statement. The February 14 Youth Coalition also supported the protests and called for civil disobedience for 3 days. The youth group also told participants to avoid clashing with police. Ali Salman, leader of Al Wefaq opposition society welcomed the Tamarod plans. \\"We support any peaceful movement, at any time and from any party. Everybody has the right to protest ... the call for protests on August 14 shows that the Bahraini people will not cease to demonstrate until they achieve their demands,\\" he added. Al Wefaq however, stopped short of taking part in the Tamarod movement, blaming their secession on clashes between security forces and protesters. \\"[I]t is going to be a peaceful movement but having said that I also expect clashes ... I only pray that there are no victims,\\" said Ali Salman. Jailed activist Zainab al-Khawaja smuggled a letter from prison in which she called people to participate in Tamarod protests. \\"On 14 February 2011, the people of Bahrain took to the street to demand their rights ... and on 14 August, the day of Tamarod, the people have to go out with same strength in order to send a message to the world and the regime that they have not and will never back down,\\" the letter read. Zainab's father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja who is also jailed delivered a message via Mohammed al-Maskati of Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) in which he called for \\"a peaceful Tamarrod on August 14th ... under the banner of 'Right to Self determination'.\\" Another jailed rights activist, Nabeel Rajab also announced his support for Tamarod protests. \\"I call for rebellion [tamarrod] against all laws that violate the rights of the people. The law should be enacted to establish justice and equality between people and the protection of rights,\\" his Twitter account, followed by 211,000+ and controlled by others quoted him saying. On 13 July, the Ministry of Interior (MoI) warned against joining the 14 August protests which it called \\"illegal demonstrations and activities that endanger security\\". The MoI said it will \\"deal with any attempt to disturb security and stability\\". In anticipation to the 14 August protests, the MoI stepped up security measures and further warned that it will take legal action toward those who participate. The MOI has warned Bahrainis: The Prime Minister joined the MoI in warning against planned protests. The Al Wefaq opposition movement slammed the warnings and affirmed \\"the [people's] right to protest peacefully\\". \\"This will not solve the political crisis. The solution is in satisfying the people's aspirations for liberty, social justice and democracy,\\" Al Wefaq added. Other opposition societies such as National Democratic Action Society (Waad) and Nationalist Democratic Assembly also joined Al Wefaq in affirming the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Mainstream opposition societies cancelled a planned mass protest on 14 August, \\"because of the heavily intimidating security presence in Manama\\". Tamarod is reported to have gained popularity among the opposition since mid-July, prompting the United States Embassy in Manama to eventually issue a warning for U.S. citizens to avoid certain areas in Bahrain on 14 August. The selected areas were mostly opposition strongholds. For weeks, the government was reported to have intensified its house raids and arrests against over five hundred wanted activists, many of them sleeping outside their homes for months in anticipation of such raids. Maryam al-Khawaja, the acting head of Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) said nightly raids were now occurring all day long and that physical, psychological and sexual torture had continued. \\"Since the announcing of the planned protest on the 14th of August ... [we have been seeing] a very severe escalation in the crackdown,\\" she said. She added that Tamarod protests were \\"part and parcel of the ongoing uprising that started on 14 February 2011\\". According to activists, up to 400 were arrested during the month of Ramadhan (10 July–7 August) and more than 100 houses were raided in Manama alone. =Parliament emergency session= On 28 July, the Parliament held an extraordinary session at the request of the King, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa in which they submitted 22 recommendations calling for tougher penalties against \\"terrorist crimes\\" including stripping those convicted with inciting or committing such acts from their nationality and freezing their bank accounts as well as a ban on protests in the capital, Manama. Other recommendations included \\"increasing punishment for anyone propagating false information about Bahrain in social media networks\\", \\"taking legal action against certain political associations which incite and support violent and terrorist acts\\" and \\"taking all possible measures to impose peace and security, even if it means imposing a state of national safety [state of emergency]\\". The parliament has been dominated by government supporters, especially after the opposition submitted their resignations in early 2011 in protest against government crackdown. According to RT, the Bahraini government often employs the terms \\"terrorists\\" or \\"thugs\\" to refer to protesters and has used \\"broad definitions of terrorism to detain scores of protesters and to convict several opposition leaders\\". A week earlier, the government used an explosion as a pretext to block several planned anti-government protests. The session was held after weeks of escalations in clashes between protesters and security forces which had seen militant groups using bombs and police firing tear gas and birdshot, and the Minister of Justice said \\"terrorism\\" must be quelled before national reconciliation could begin. According to Reem Khalifa of the Associated Press, however, the session \\"appeared prompted by opposition calls for major protests Aug. 14.\\" Khalil al-Marzouq of Al Wefaq said the recommendations were unconstitutional and that the session was a \\"popular cover [for the authorities] in order to issue its decrees.\\" Emile Nakhleh said the session was \\"a spectacle of venom, a display of vulgarity, and an unabashed nod to increased dictatorship.\\" He added that one MP referred to the Shia, who form the majority of citizens as \\"dogs\\" and that 14 August planned protests \\"drove the timing of the session\\". Bill Law of the BBC News said the \\"recommendations if implemented in full would effectively return the country to a state of martial law\\". An unnamed western diplomat said the recommendations timing was likely due to 14 August protest plans and the increasing violence. Marc Jones said that many of the recommendations were already in place. \\"Thirty-one Bahrainis were stripped of their citizenship back in November 2012, and there has been a de facto ban on protests in Manama since last year,\\" he added and listed other examples of what he called \\"reactionary laws\\" already in place. Maryam al-Khawaja said the government was merely giving a legal cover for its practices that have been in place for years. On the other hand, Tareq Al Hassan, the Public Security Chief said the session was historical and that it did not target a specific group or sect, rather it targeted terrorists and instigators. \\"14 August will pass just like regular days of the year and nothing will happen,\\" he added. The King, the Crown Prince and the Prime Minister (PM) welcomed the recommendations of the Parliament. The King ordered their rapid codification while the PM asked his ministers to carry out the recommendations immediately, or face dismissal if they slowed down. On 6 August, the King issued two decrees banning all \\"demonstrations, sit-ins, marches and public gatherings\\" in Manama (except \\"sit-ins outside [offices of] international organizations\\"), and jailing and/or fining parents if their minor children (under 16) were found to take part in protests in two occasions within six months. During the Parliament recess period, the constitution of Bahrain allows the King to issue decrees which are effective as laws. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern about the recommendations, highlighting the right to nationality and asking the government of Bahrain \\"to fully comply with its international human rights commitments, including respect for freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and association\\". Amnesty International said the emergency decrees were outrageous, violated the international law and a \\"shameful attempt to completely ban any form of dissent and freedom of expression in the country\\". \\"We fear that these draconian measures will be used in an attempt to legitimize state violence as new protests are being planned for 14 August,\\" said Amnesty's regional director. A spokesman of the Bahraini government cited increasing violence including a policeman death and said the recommendations were \\"about trying to control the situation and trying to stabilze and secure people safety.\\" Human Rights Watch also criticized the recommendations, calling them \\"a whole new set of draconian restrictions\\" that would create \\"a new state of emergency\\". \\"The government has talked a lot about the need for national reconciliation but, once again, its actions in taking on a raft of stern new measures to suppress legitimate protest are undermining any prospects for successful dialogue,\\" its regional director, Nadim Houry said. The International Federation for Human Rights and World Organization Against Torture \\"firmly denounce[d]\\" what they called \\"the intensifying crackdown on the Bahraini civil society\\". Freedom House said the recommendations were \\"a serious new threat to human rights in Bahrain, particularly freedom of expression and assembly\\", and that they violated the ICCPR treaty. The leader of Bahrain Press Associated said they were \\"a black page in the history [of the Parliament]\\". =Crackdown= Three days after the Parliamentary special session, the government escalated its crackdown, arresting a photographer, Hussain Hubail, a blogger and his lawyer, and has continued to deny visas to foreign journalists. The arrested blogger, Mohamed Hassan also worked as a fixer for foreign journalists visiting the country and his lawyer, AbdulAziz Mosa was arrested after tweeting that Hassan was mistreated in prison. On 2 August, a second photographer, Qassim Zain Aldeen was arrested. Several Bahrain-based rights organizations wrote an open letter on 6 August co-signed by a number of international NGOs asking other international NGOs, mainstream media, Bahrain allies and the United Nations to pay close attention to Bahrain over the next week, especially on 14 August, which they said would likely see the country \\"come under lockdown\\". The letter said the rights situations in Bahrain has \\"rapidly deteriorated\\" during the previous weeks. On 7 August, Al Jazeera English reporter, Hyder Abbasi was prevented from boarding a flight from Qatar to Bahrain. On 8 August, a third photographer, Ahmed Al-Fardan was briefly arrested, threatened and beaten by plainclothes police. On 9 August, Bahraini-Danish human rights activist Maryam al-Khawaja was prevented from boarding a British Airways flight to Bahrain at the request of the Bahraini government. Al-Khawaja who was planning to stay in Bahrain before and during 14 August said the move \\"show[ed] how nervous they [the authorities] are and how much they have to hide.\\" The same day, an opposition activist, Mohammad Sanad al-Makina was arrested from Bahrain International Airport while attempting to board a flight to Sri Lanka with his family. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience. An activist reported that 7 journalists were in hiding due to house raids. On 8 August, the February 14 Youth Coalition said they had gathered tens of thousands of signatures calling for the right to self-determination. On 10 August, the Prime Minister renewed his warning against planned protests during a visit to Muharraq island. He also accused protesters of wanting \\"to change the regime and drag[ging] the country to chaos and ruin.\\" \\"[T]his island will burn to a cinder all those who seek to tamper with its security and stability,\\" he added. The same day an American teacher was deported from Bahrain due to her \\"radical writing,\\" the Ministry of State for Communications said. Erin Kilbride was accused of working as an unaccredited journalist writing for the outlawed Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR) and As-Safir Lebanese newspaper, and of having links with Hezbollah. \\"[Her posting was] deemed to incite hatred against the government and members of the Royal family,\\" the ministry added. Al-Khawaja of BCHR denied Kilbride had written for them and said an As-Safir journalist denied the allegations too. \\"That was something made up by the government,\\" she added. Bahraini authorities blocked bahrainaugust14.com, a website that offered timeline coverage for the protests within 24 hours of its launch on 10 August. A human rights activist said that despite the official ban and security checkpoints, a protest was held in Manama on 10 August, and was dispersed by police using stun grenades. On the other hand, the MoI reported that \\"terrorists\\" attacked a police patrol in Noaim using molotov cocktails. The Bahrain Mirror mentioned that all leaves for August were cancelled by several government agencies and ministries. On 12 August, a human rights activist said police fired tear gas and stun grenades on several anti- government protests, and arrested nine demonstrators. The same day, the PM issued another warning against protests after an urgent Ministerial meeting, saying his government will \\"forcefully confront\\" them. \\"[The government] will punish [those] who stand behind them in line with the recommendations of the Bahrain National Council [parliament],\\" he added. Patrick Cockburn of The Independent said the PM warning showed the \\"nervousness\\" of Bahraini authorities ahead of the protests. The PM also held a meeting with the commander of Peninsula Shield Force, a joint Gulf Cooperation Council force that helped crackdown on protests in 2011. The state-controlled Bahrain News Agency (BNA) also reported that the PM headed a \\"high level meeting\\" attended by high-ranking officials to talk over arrangements before protests. The PM said his government was \\"at a critical stage [in the struggle to] eliminate terrorism\\". On 13 August, Bahrain Mirror and activists said security forces have installed barbed wire around a number of residential areas expected to witness large protests. The areas were completely caged according to activists. Al Wefaq said authorities had turned some areas into a \\"vast prison for inhabitants.\\" The Associated Press reported that barbed wire with checkpoints in between had separated Shia neighborhoods from main roads and Reuters witnesses said security forces had deployed reinforcements, including armored vehicles by night. The area of the-now demolished Pearl Roundabout was filled with hundreds of riot police standing next to armored personnel carriers. Tamarod spokesperson, Hussain Yousif said they will carry on with the protests despite government definite crackdown. The MoI said the heavy deployment was in order to \\"[preserve] security and order, and to guarantee an easy flow of traffic\\". On the same day, Bahraini authorities summoned the Lebanese ambassador in Bahrain to file a complaint against a conference held by Bahrain Rebellion Movement in Beirut. In the conference, opposition activists called for civil disobedience and mass protests, the BNA reported. A number of Bahraini opposition politicians and human rights activists have based their activities in Beirut where they enjoy more freedom. The BNA added that the Lebanese ambassador said his government was not supportive of the conference and that they did not wish to interfere in Bahraini internal affairs. A day earlier, the salafist Al Asalah Islamic Society had criticized Lebanon for hosting the conference. =Reactions prior to protests= Reporters Without Borders expressed its concern at what it described \\"a new upsurge in abusive treatment of journalists in the run-up to the major 'Tamarod' rally\\". The France-based NGO said authorities had arrested 2 bloggers and 3 photographers in recent days. \\"The authorities plan to impose a news blackout on the 14 August demonstration by jailing netizens and preventing journalists and human rights defenders from visiting Bahrain,\\" it added. Amnesty International issued a statement calling the government of Bahrain to allow Wednesday protests and expressed its fear that the new legislation will be used as a legal cover for quashing peaceful protests. \\"The Bahraini authorities must not crack down on mass anti-government protests scheduled for tomorrow,\\" it said. The UK-based NGO also condemned the arrest of \\"journalists, photographers, bloggers and others active on social media networks in recent days [as a move to silence critics]\\". The Bahraini government \\"vehemently refutes any allegations of targeted arrests,\\" said an Information Affairs Authority spokesperson. Nicholas McGeehan of Human Rights Watch said the government preparations were unjustified, inappropriate and disproportionate. \\"Bahraini authorities have a grim recent history of using excessive and lethal force to suppress peaceful protests, followed by the persecution of protesters and even doctors who treated their wounds,\\" he added. The International Freedom of Expression Exchange described Bahrain authorities preparations as \\"pre-emptive crackdown on a peaceful, nationwide protest that has been weeks in the planning.\\" The United States embassy said it would close its doors on 14 August and told Americans to \\"avoid non- essential travel inside the country\\". Naval Support Activity Bahrain, the base of United States Fifth Fleet ordered sailors to avoid Manama Souq, Bahrain City Centre and Seef Mall where protests were expected. Timeline =14 August= Large numbers of security forces were deployed in Manama and helicopters hovered over. Roads leading to the city were guarded by security checkpoints and surrounded by barbed wire. Reuters reported that all shops were closed in some villages, while most shops in Manama remained open, with big police presence in the area, especially near Bab Al Bahrain. Tamarod had called for a general strike and pleaded businesses to close, while the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry issued a warning for businesses against responding to calls for a general strike, or risk facing legal action. An activist said protests started by dawn and that at least 3 were held in Manama. The Associated Press reported that small protests occurred in the morning and that most businesses \\"appeared to be shuttered\\", prompting Al Wefaq to claim success for the general strike. BNA reported that the PM made a visit to a shopping mall in Manama to assure visitors it was \\"business as usual\\". In the early morning, up to 100 protesters took to the street in Saar village, west of Manama. The protest was peaceful and protesters were chanting anti-government slogans and waving Bahraini flags, witnesses said. Shortly before the arrival of security forces, the protest dispersed peacefully. In another village south of Manama, the MoI reported that an Asian worker trying to open a blocked road was injured after getting attacked with molotov cocktails and that a main road in Muharraq was blocked with burning tires. It described both incidents as \\"terrorism\\". Protests were also held in Malkiya, Juffair and Sitra where protesters held peaceful sit-ins and formed human chains. Some protesters were sitting in front of their houses, still they were attacked by security forces, witnesses reported. A video posted on YouTube showed police arresting and beating two men who were sitting in front of a house. In Shakhura, west of Manama, police charged a group of 300 protesters who were restricted behind a barbed wire using tear gas and birdshot. Images by Reuters showed police beating an arrested protester after they dispersed the protest. In Karrana similar clashes occurred, with protesters hurling back molotov cocktails. No injuries were reported for both incidents. Later, police converged at Seef district in Manama, and \\"cordoned off the area using barbed wire\\" following a video message by Hussain Yousif to hold a rally there. Agence France-Presse (AFP) witnesses reported that hundreds of protesters who gathered in several Shia villages faced police tear gas and birdshot. Citizen journalists and activists provided live photo coverage of the violence on Instagram and Twitter. Human Rights First (HRF) estimated turnout to be in thousands. Al Wefaq reported that over 60 rallies were held in 40 different areas throughout the day. Euronews and Al Jazeera English estimated the number of protests at 60 and reported they were mostly peaceful. Al-Mahafdha of BCHR reported that authorities arrested 20 protesters, including 5 women and a minor. He said protests turnout was in thousands \\"despite the campaign of intimidation and surrounding villages with barbed wire\\". The MoI said the woman driver who was arrested with her companions tried to \\"run over a policeman at a road block\\". The MoI added they arrested 20 individuals, among them 8 fugitives. Al Wefaq reported that the number of the arrested was 23 and that 4 were released later. Some injuries were reported in Karzakan and Demistan by the BYSHR. BCHR said 10 were injured by tear gas (inhalation) and birdshot, while Al Wefaq said 2 people were in a critical condition. The BCHR accused the government of using \\"large amounts of tear gas ... to disperse anyone gathering on the streets\\". \\"[I]t has been very difficult for protesters to move from their villages onto the main streets because of the barbed wires that were set up last night,\\" al-Khawaja said. The BCHR also accused the government of dispatching mercenaries from Pakistan and Jordan to aid security forces in the crackdown, however an opposition figure said this claim was hard to prove, because security forces wear masks. The Associated Press and AFP reported that the heavy deployment of security forces have succeeded in preventing large-scale protests in Manama, instead protesters were confined to neighborhoods around the city. Al Wefaq released a statement accusing authorities of cutting Internet connection in a number of areas. \\"Personal devices of some citizens have also been selectively cut off,\\" the statement added. The secular-leftist Waad society said that instant messaging applications such as WhatsApp had been blocked by VIVA Bahrain telecommunications company. Several citizens also complained of loss of Internet for several hours in different locations during the day. They said the cut was at a time when protests were being held. Previously in February 2011, when the uprising began, a similar situation occurred during which the Internet became either slow or was lost completely. Telecommunication companies said then that the problem was due an overload on Internet networks. Reuters described the protests as \\"an upsurge of a two-and-a-half-year-old campaign\\". It reported that the morning saw protests end peacefully, while in the evening clashes between protesters and police occurred. Bahrainis in London organized a small, but vocal protest starting from the Bahraini embassy to Downing Street. Protesters criticized the United Kingdom over continuing to sign arms trades to Bahrain, despite human rights violations. \\"Instead of challenging Bahrain on human rights record our government is supporting it and it's a disgrace,\\" said one protester. The websites of MoI and Qorvis public relations firm, which works for Bahraini authorities were targeted by hackers belonging to Anonymous group. =15–16 August= In the morning of 15 August, protesters blocked several main streets and in the afternoon they clashed with police after holding sit-ins in a number of villages, in response to a call by February 14 Youth Coalition, the Bahrain Mirror reported. Tamarod had planned protests in Manama on 16 August, including a \\"car demonstration\\", however few hours before the start time, they cancelled the event. Security forces had been heavily deployed in Manama in anticipation of the protests. Tamarod said that by playing out this tactic, they \\"controlled the distribution and actions of security forces\\". Hundreds of protesters in several Shia villages took to the street at night following a call by February 14 Youth Coalition. They called for the overthrow of the monarchy and chanted \\"Down with [King] Hamad\\", before clashes erupted with security forces. Police fired \\"buckshot, tear gas, and sound grenades\\" in response to protesters throwing stones and molotov cocktails at them. Al-Mahafdha said protests were held in Manama, Al Daih and Samaheej among other places and that there were no reported injuries. The MoI reported arresting members of a \\"terrorist group\\" in the village of Bani Jamra, west of Manama. Witnesses from Bani Jamra said detainees were severely beaten before arrest and that one of them with sickle-cell anemia was taken by an ambulance. Reactions Spokesperson of Tamarod, Hussain Yousif lauded protesters response and called for further protests on Thursday and Friday, and said they planned to organize further protests in the weeks to come. \\"Many responded to the calls to come out and protest today ... The government has converted Bahrain into a military base trying to isolate the villages to prevent people from reaching protest sites,\\" he added. Ali Salman of Al Wefaq praised Tamarod protests, saying they scored more success than expected by drawing media attention and maintaining peacefulness. He also expressed his relief about the small number of casualties and the lack of deaths. Human Rights First (HRF) criticized the government of Bahrain response to protests, which they said reflected the \\"increasing levels of frustration felt by many in Bahrain at the lack of any real reform\\". \\"What happened today confirmed fears that the government of Bahrain is determined to crush any form of dissent,\\" said Brian J. Dooley of HRF. The BNA downplayed the effect of the protests, saying it was \\"business as usual\\" in the country. \\"Bahrainis and expatriates reported to work on Wednesday just like any other day, defying calls by radical opposition groups of road blockades and attack on properties,\\" the state-run agency added. Critics said the protests failed as most streets were empty and protests disorganized. Abdulla Al Junaid of the pro-government National Union Gathering said an opposition cleric criticized Tamarod as a \\"stillborn\\". The United States expressed its concern at the possibility of violence. \\"We remain very concerned about continuing incidents of violence in Bahrain and, of course, the possibility for violence and would urge all parties to strongly condemn violence and contribute to fostering a climate of dialogue and reconciliation,\\" said the spokesperson of State Department. The spokesperson added that they \\"support[ed] the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and of course, the right of freedom of expression, including in Bahrain\\". Analysis Prior to the protests, HRF said they were \\"likely to be the most significant in over a year\\". Saeed al- Shehabi of the London-based Bahrain Freedom Movement said the Tamarod movement would \\"renew Bahrain's forgotten revolution\\". Mansoor al-Jamri, editor of Al- Wasat independent newspaper expressed pessimism about the situation, saying that \\"it's a very volatile situation. We might be heading for a very harsh period.\\" Marc Jones was also pessimistic. \\"It is unlikely that these 'Tamorrod' protests will amount to anything, especially as the Bahraini authorities have spent the past two years breaking the back of the opposition movement. In 2011, thousands were arrested, tens killed, and dozens tortured,\\" he said. Ashley Lindsey of Stratfor global intelligence firm said the likelihood of protests reaching Manama was low due to the experience of security forces. Writing for RT, Afshin Rattansi speculated that if 14 August protests are met with state violence, then it could be one of the last times Bahraini activists use peaceful means to seek democratic change and that other methods could include an armed struggle in the same way the anti-apartheid movement led by Nelson Mandela deployed armed tactics after peaceful protests failed to bring about change. Jean Shaoul wrote in the World Socialist Web Site that the concurrent timing of crackdown in Bahrain and Egypt was not a coincidence and that evidence showed it was coordinated by the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf. Ken Hanly wrote that the political violence in Egypt \\"will no doubt overshadow whatever repressive measures are taken against protests in Bahrain\\". Ala'a Shehabi wrote in the Foreign Policy that the choice of Independence Day by Tamarod should be understood as an attempt to gain true full sovereignty as opposed to Stephen D. Krasner's Organized Hypocrisy (1999): \\"the paradox that though there is an informal understanding that states are sovereign, they can still be subject to constant intervention\\". Jane Kinninmont of Chatham House said Tamarod protests would not succeed to replicate the Egyptian scenario \\"because the army in Bahrain doesn't play the same role, and many of the security services don’t include Shi'ite Bahrainis, so you don’t get that same sense of solidarity\\". Matar Matar of Al Wefaq said that even if thousands had participated in Tamarod protests, the situation would remain the same as long as the United States continued to support what he called an \\"authoritarian regime\\" in Bahrain. Writing for the Gulf News Hasan Tariq Al Hasan argued that Tamarod protests on 14 August had failed to live up to the expectations. He said that one of the main reasons was conflicting instructions between Bahrain Rebellion Movement and February 14 Youth Coalition, which launched its own Tamarod protest under the title \\"Tamarod Storm\\". Ala'a Shehabi said the security measures had made it \\"physically impossible\\" for big numbers to gather in one place. In an opinion column in Al-Wasat, Jameel al-Mahari said it was not appropriate to speak about failure or success of the protests, instead he argued that Bahrain's real success was when the unrest ended, \\"when everyone listens to the voice of reason, when we reach compatible solutions, when the national cohesion is restored and when people feel they are equal before law and that they all are first class citizens.\\" References Footnotes Video * Category:2013 in Bahrain Category:2013 protests Category:Aftermath of the Arab Spring Category:Arab rebellions Category:Human rights abuses in Bahrain Category:Protests in Bahrain Category:Rebellions in Bahrain ","title":"Bahrain Tamarod"},{"id":"40201415","text":"Jacob Bitzer (January 16, 1865 – February 19, 1946) was an American businessman, real estate agent, and politician who served as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

It was established by the British government on 1 April 2010 as a massive, contiguous, no-take marine reserve, it encompasses of ocean waters, including roughly 70 small islands and seven atolls of the Chagos Archipelago. The establishment of the protected area was immediately controversial, as the largest island in the area, Diego Garcia, was forcibly depopulated to make way for a United States military base in 1968 and onwards, an action that has been described as \\"ethnic cleansing\\". In a cable leaked by WikiLeaks, a US State Department official commented based on talks with British ministers and officials that establishing the reserve to restrict fishing would be the \\"most effective long-term way to prevent any of the Chagos Islands' former inhabitants or their descendants from resettling.\\" The same cable explained that the protection would permit environmental damage if caused by military use: \\"the terms of reference for the establishment of a marine park would clearly state that the BIOT, including Diego Garcia, was reserved for military uses. ... the establishment of a marine reserve had the potential to be a 'win-win situation in terms of establishing situational awareness' of the BIOT... [the government] sought 'no constraints on military operations' as a result of the establishment of a marine park.\\" An exemption in the MPA allows people from the US base on Diego Garcia to continue fishing. In 2010, more than 28 tonnes of fish was caught for use by personnel on the base. On 18 March 2015, the Permanent Court of Arbitration unanimously held that the establishment of the marine protected area (MPA) was illegal under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as Mauritius had legally binding rights to fish in the waters surrounding the Chagos Archipelago, to an eventual return of the Chagos Archipelago, and to the preservation of any minerals or oil discovered in or near the Chagos Archipelago prior to its return. The decision of the court is final and binding. The MPA is now under negotiation between the UK government and government of Mauritius. The CMPA is administered with assistance from the Chagos Trust, funded by donations and the British Government. Tourist visitors are generally not permitted, although as of 2016 private yachts sailing across the Indian Ocean may apply for mooring permits outside the strict nature reserve areas.  Description  The Chagos marine reserve protects the world’s largest coral atoll (the Great Chagos Bank) and has one of the healthiest reef systems in the cleanest waters of the world, supporting nearly half the area of good quality reefs in the Indian Ocean. No-take marine reserves are areas of the sea in which there is no fishing allowed and as little other human disturbance as can be reasonably arranged. The Chagos Archipelago of 70 tiny islands and atolls is located in the central Indian Ocean, about 1,500 km from the southern tip of India, 3,400 km due east of Africa and 3,000 km west of Indonesia. Politically, Chagos is constituted as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Establishment Previous to the establishment of the marine reserve, the Chagos Archipelago had been declared an Environmental (Preservation and Protection) Zone with legislation in place to protect much of the area’s natural resources. Commercial fishing, however, was licensed for both reef fish and tuna.Koldewey et al, Potential benefits to fisheries and biodiversity of the Chagos Archipelago/British Indian Ocean Territory as a no-take marine reserve Though the UK government has opposed the area being proposed as a World Heritage Site, it has agreed to treat it as such in order to preserve its environmental value.Chagos Conservation Trust Chagos conservation discussion paper The case for a large scale marine reserve in the Chagos was first put forward by a consortium of conservation organisations led by the Chagos Environment Network, a collaboration of nine leading scientific and conservation organisations, in \\"The Chagos Archipelago: Its Nature and the Future\\"Chagos Conservation Trust Chagos: Its Nature and the Future which was launched in March 2009. The Chagos Environment Network was the leading advocate for the reserve during the consultation period and organised two of the major petitions in favour of the reserve being set up.Chagos Environment Network, A Unique Scientific and Conservation Opportunity for the UK From 10 November 2009 to 5 March 2010, a public consultation was carried out by the UK government to take views on whether or not a marine protected area (MPA) should be established in the archipelago. Respondents were asked not only whether they believed that the MPA should be established but also to what degree they thought it should be protected, either to establish a fully no- take marine reserve or a less protected marine protected area that would allow some fishing. The response to this consultation was high, with over 250,000 people expressing their views on the issue either through the use of petitions or more lengthy written replies. Over 90% declared their support for greater marine protection, with the majority believing that it should be a no-take marine reserve.British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Facilitator's Report The loss of the approximately £800,000 a year earned from tuna licensing was frequently raised as a possible hurdle to the designation of the marine reserve. In the final months leading up to the designation, the Bertarelli Foundation offered to fill the funding gap left by the absence of fisheries income and thereby contribute to the costs of an enforcement boat for a period of five years.The Pew Charitable Trusts, Global Ocean Legacy - Chagos Following this response, the total area of the Chagos’ Exclusive Economic Zone was declared a fully no-take area,British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Announcement of the creation of the marine reserve with the exception of a 3-mile zone around the island of Diego Garcia. The British Foreign Secretary instructed the BIOT Commissioner to establish the Marine Protected Area on 1 April 2010, which was essentially the last day he could do so before the dissolution of Parliament prior to the 2010 British general election. The Chagos MPA's establishment and first five years of protection has been supported by major funding from the Bertarelli Foundation. Ecology and biodiversity Ninety percent of the United Kingdom’s biodiversity lies in its Overseas Territories, and the Chagos archipelago is by far the most biodiverse marine area in the United Kingdom’s waters.Chagos Conservation Trust Home page Its habitats include extensive shallow limestone reefs and associated environments, about 300 seamountsSheppard et al, Chagos Conservation and Management plan and a deep sea trench - an underwater canyon more than 4,900 m (16,000 ft) deep.National Oceanography Centre, Southampton Marine conservation in the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT): science issues and opportunities =Coral= One of the most unusual aspects of the Chagos marine environment is its extremely healthy and diverse coral cover, which is dense even in deep water and on the steep outer slopes of reefs. The area hosts 220 species of coral including the Ctenella chagius, a variety of brain coral believed to be endemic to the atoll, and staghorn coral which is important to protecting low-lying islands from wave erosion.Chagos Conservation Trust, Corals Chagos provides an important benchmark for coral conservation, and is a 'natural laboratory' in which we can study the functioning of these wonderfully complex ecosystems.ZSL, Chagos Biodiversity and Threats =Fish= The fish of the region are equally diverse, with at least 784 different species having been identified including the Chagos clownfish (Amphiprion chagosensis) which is endemic to the archipelago. The strictly no-take Chagos Marine Reserve has freed Chagos' fish populations from fishing pressure within the reserve's boundaries. The marine reserve is an important refuge for overfished pelagic species such as manta rays, sharks including whale sharks, tuna and is of particular importance for globally threatened species, such as the silky shark. It is also believed, based on results of research on similar deep water and diverse underwater terrain in other parts of the world, that the deep water trench is very likely to harbour a variety of previously undiscovered species.Chagos Conservation Trust, Fish =Turtles= The islands of the archipelago provide vital nesting sites for green and hawksbill turtles (Chelonia mydas and Eretmochelys imbricata). Since the hawksbill turtle is labelled ‘critically endangered’ and the green turtle ‘endangered’ on the IUCN Red List, the Chagos populations are considered to be of international importance. It is estimated that 300-700 hawksbill and 400-800 green turtles nest annually across the 55 islands of the archipelago.Chagos Conservation Trust, Turtles =Mammals= Environments of Chagos Archipelago provides rich biodiversity and support varieties of cetacean species within the vicinity, such as three populations of blue whalesDunne R.

ResearchGate and toothed whales (such as sperm, pilot, orca, pseudo-orca, risso's and other dolphins such as spinners). Regional extinct dugongs were historically seen in the archipelago, hence the Sea Cow Island was named due to the presences of the species. =Birds= The breeding seabirds of the Chagos are considered to be of international importance. The archipelago harbours eighteen different species of breeding birds and ten of its islands have been designated as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by Birdlife International, making the region the most diverse breeding seabird community in this tropical region,Chagos Conservation Trust, Birds though the presence of human-introduced rats on several of the other islands severely hinder seabird nesting on these. Five species are considered to be breeding in internationally significant numbers: the sooty tern (Sterna fuscata); the brown and lesser noddy (Anous stolidus and Anous tenuirostris); the red-footed booby (Sula sula) and the wedge-tailed shearwater (Puffinus pacificus). =Coconut crabs= The world’s largest terrestrial arthropod, the coconut crab (Birgus latro) is abundant on the islands of the Chagos archipelago, with an overall density in the conservation area on Diego Garcia of 298 crabs per hectare – the highest ever recorded. Due to the long distances which the larvae of the coconut crab can travel, the Chagos population is considered important in replenishing numbers in other areas of the Indian Ocean.Chagos Conservation Trust, Coconut crabs Scientific research Scientific and conservation efforts are being undertaken to tell us more about these islands, remove invasive plant and animal species, and restore native vegetation. These initiatives are all an important contribution to the conservation of Chagos, and global biodiversity. In February and March 2013, a research expedition was undertaken in the Chagos Marine Protected Area (MPA).ZSL, Open Ocean Monitoring in the Chagos Archipelago The expedition, which was sponsored by the Bertarelli Foundation, in partnership with Stanford University and the University of Western Australia, piloted an electronic tagging project to examine the feasibility of using remote technologies to monitor the movement of important pelagic species in the region. Five different types of electronic tags were deployed in this study, with a total of 99 electronic tags placed on 95 animals, along with the installation of an acoustic receiver array around two northern atolls to detect animal movements.Bertarelli Foundation, Tagging of Pelagics Pollution According to a report by a scientific adviser to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which the British Government refused to disclose, suggests that the Pacific Marlin, an ageing tug hired by London used to patrol the British Indian Ocean Territories, had been discharging waste while docked in waters shared with US Navy vessels. The Independent also revealed that American ships have been pouring waste including treated human sewage for three decades into the lagoon on Diego Garcia, which has served as a key strategic base for the US since the 1970s. Mauritian opposition to Marine Protected Area The MPA has been condemned by Mauritius, which owned the Chagos Islands before they were detached by the UK before the colony was granted independence, and which have remained under British control ever since. The Government of Mauritius initiated proceedings on 20 December 2010 against the UK Government under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to challenge the legality of the marine protected area. Mauritius considers that the UK, not being a \\"coastal State\\" under UNCLOS and international law, had no authority to purport to establish a marine protected area around the Chagos Archipelago and that the MPA was not compatible with the rights of the Chagossians. The original Chagossians were deported from the largest island, Diego Garcia, 40 years earlier to make way for Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia, with port facilities and an airstrip capable of handling the largest aircraft in the US Air Force. The Chagossians say they would in effect be barred from ever returning because the marine protection zone would stop them fishing, their main livelihood. \\"There would be a natural injustice. The fish would have more rights than us, the conservation groups have fallen into a trap. They are being used by the government to prevent us returning,\\" said Roch Evenor, secretary of the UK Chagos Support Association. =Greenpeace= In a letter to Greenpeace, the Mauritian Lalit de Klas political party said \\"The British government's plan for a marine protected area is a grotesquely transparent ruse designed to perpetuate the banning of the people of Mauritius and Chagos from part of their own country,\\" In 2012, Greenpeace ship SY Rainbow Warrior was in the Indian Ocean region and the government of Mauritius initially blocked it from making a scheduled stopover at Port-Louis harbour. The reason for the refusal was the unconditional support that Greenpeace has given the British authorities in the controversial project of a protected marine park in the Chagos archipelago. Mauritius has officially denounced the \\"hypocritical\\" position of Greenpeace on this matter and deeply regrets that Greenpeace International chose to close its eyes on the illegal excision of the Chagos archipelago by the UK, despite its being recognised as part of Mauritius by various international groups. Mauritius insisted that Greenpeace, which claims to be fighting for environmental protection, showed a hypocritical attitude by remaining silent over the proposed construction of a marine park. Thus, in official correspondence, Greenpeace International said at the outset that: =WikiLeaks= On December 1, 2010, WikiLeaks released a leaked US Embassy London diplomatic cable dating back to 2009 exposing British and US calculations in creating the marine nature reserve. The cable relays exchanges between US Political Counselor Richard Mills and British Director of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Colin Roberts, in which Roberts \\"asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago’s former residents.\\" Richard Mills concludes: The cableFull discussion and copy of WikiLeaks cables - which records Roberts' assertion that the marine reserve was proposed by the Pew Charitable Trust, was classified as confidential and \\"no foreigners\\", and leaked as part of the Cablegate cache. The same cable explained that the protection would permit environmental damage if caused by military use: \\"the terms of reference for the establishment of a marine park would clearly state that the BIOT, including Diego Garcia, was reserved for military uses. ... the establishment of a marine reserve had the potential to be a 'win-win situation in terms of establishing situational awareness' of the BIOT. ... [the government] sought 'no constraints on military operations' as a result of the establishment of a marine park.\\" An exemption in the MPA allows fishing to continue to supply food to the US military base; in 2010, more than of fish were caught daily for consumption by the 3,200 personnel on the base. Chagos Marine Protected Area declared illegal After the Permanent Court of Arbitration decision, the Prime Minister of Mauritius pointed out that it is the first time that the UK's conduct with regard to the Chagos Archipelago has been considered and condemned by any international court or tribunal. He qualified the ruling as an important milestone in the relentless struggle, at the political, diplomatic and other levels, of successive Governments over the years for the effective exercise by Mauritius of its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. The tribunal considered in detail the undertakings given by the United Kingdom to the Mauritian Ministers at the Lancaster House talks in September 1965. The UK had argued that those undertakings were not binding and had no status in international law. The Tribunal firmly rejected that argument, holding that those undertakings became a binding international agreement upon the independence of Mauritius, and have bound the UK ever since. It found that the UK's commitments towards Mauritius in relation to fishing rights and oil and mineral rights in the Chagos Archipelago are legally binding.  Exclusion of Chagossian peoples  The Chagos MPA was designated in 2010, during a legal deliberation about whether natives of Chagos would be able to return to the island after forty years of exile. If they return, they will not be able to fish for subsistence because of the MPA’s status as a strict no-take reserve. Despite this, fishing is allowed around the atoll of Diego Garcia, the island where the joint UK-US military base is located. Diego Garcia, the only current pollution source in the archipelago, is exempt with the purpose of maintaining military operations. The establishment of the Chagos MPA sustains the injustice that the prior removal of the indigenous Chagossians represents by ignoring their pursuits to return to their home. Even though the rights to the archipelago are disputed, the sovereignty of Chagos clearly rests with the UK, who have complete control of access to and withdrawal of resources from the islands.

Gameplay Strife pits two teams of players against each other, both teams are based at opposite corners of the map in their respective bases. Bases consist of one central structure, creep spawn points, three generators and a hero spawning pool. The goal of the game is to destroy the central structure of the opposite base, called the \\"Crux\\". Players achieve this by selecting heroes with unique skills to combat the other team, both teams can select the same heroes. Each game a player chooses one hero to be for the duration of the match. Every hero has four abilities that may be acquired and upgraded as the hero gains experience and levels up. Heroes abilities are often very similar to the ones of the characters of several other MOBA games.

Specifically, it is a way of projecting a stimulus onto a low-dimensional subspace so that as much information as possible about the stimulus is preserved in the neural response. It is motivated by the fact that natural stimuli are typically confined by their statistics to a lower-dimensional space than that spanned by white noiseD.J. Field. \\"Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells.\\" J. Opt. Soc. am. A 4:2479-2394, 1987. but correctly identifying this subspace using traditional techniques is complicated by the correlations that exist within natural images. Within this subspace, stimulus-response functions may be either linear or nonlinear. The idea was originally developed by Tatyana Sharpee, Nicole Rust, and William Bialek in 2003.Sharpee, Tatyana, Nicole C. Rust, and William Bialek. \\"Maximally informative dimensions: analyzing neural responses to natural signals.\\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (2003): 277-284. Mathematical formulation Neural stimulus-response functions are typically given as the probability of a neuron generating an action potential, or spike, in response to a stimulus \\\\mathbf{s}. The goal of maximally informative dimensions is to find a small relevant subspace of the much larger stimulus space that accurately captures the salient features of \\\\mathbf{s}. Let D denote the dimensionality of the entire stimulus space and K denote the dimensionality of the relevant subspace, such that K \\\\ll D. We let {\\\\mathbf{v}^K} denote the basis of the relevant subspace, and \\\\mathbf{s}^K the projection of \\\\mathbf{s} onto { \\\\mathbf{v}^K }. Using Bayes' theorem we can write out the probability of a spike given a stimulus: : P(spike\\\\mathbf{s}^K) = P(spike)f(\\\\mathbf{s}^K) where : f(\\\\mathbf{s}^K) = \\\\frac{P(\\\\mathbf{s}^Kspike)}{P(\\\\mathbf{s}^K)} is some nonlinear function of the projected stimulus. In order to choose the optimal { \\\\mathbf{v}^K }, we compare the prior stimulus distribution P(\\\\mathbf{s}) with the spike- triggered stimulus distribution P(\\\\mathbf{s}spike) using the Shannon information. The average information (averaged across all presented stimuli) per spike is given by : I_{spike} = \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{s}} P(\\\\mathbf{s}spike) log_2 [P(\\\\mathbf{s}spike)/P(\\\\mathbf{s})].N. Brenner, S. P. Strong, R. Koberle, W. Bialek, and R. R. de Ruyter van Steveninck. \\"Synergy in a neural code. Neural Comp., 12:1531-1552, 2000. Now consider a K = 1 dimensional subspace defined by a single direction \\\\mathbf{v}. The average information conveyed by a single spike about the projection x = \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} is : I(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\int dx P_{\\\\mathbf{v}}(xspike)log2[P_{\\\\mathbf{v}}(xspike)/P_{\\\\mathbf{v}}(x)], where the probability distributions are approximated by a measured data set via P_{\\\\mathbf{v}}(xspike) = \\\\langle \\\\delta(x - \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}) spike \\\\rangle_{\\\\mathbf{s}} and P_{\\\\mathbf{v}}(x) = \\\\langle \\\\delta(x - \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v})\\\\rangle_{\\\\mathbf{s}}, i.e., each presented stimulus is represented by a scaled Dirac delta function and the probability distributions are created by averaging over all spike-eliciting stimuli, in the former case, or the entire presented stimulus set, in the latter case. For a given dataset, the average information is a function only of the direction \\\\mathbf{v}. Under this formulation, the relevant subspace of dimension K = 1 would be defined by the direction \\\\mathbf{v} that maximizes the average information I(\\\\mathbf{v}). This procedure can readily be extended to a relevant subspace of dimension K > 1 by defining : P_{\\\\mathbf{v}^K}(\\\\mathbf{x}spike) = \\\\langle \\\\prod_{i=1}^K \\\\delta(x_i - \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}_i) spike \\\\rangle_{\\\\mathbf{s}} and : P_{\\\\mathbf{v}^K}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\langle \\\\prod_{i=1}^K \\\\delta(x_i - \\\\mathbf{s} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}_i) \\\\rangle_{\\\\mathbf{s}} and maximizing I({\\\\mathbf{v}^K}). Importance Maximally informative dimensions does not make any assumptions about the Gaussianity of the stimulus set, which is important, because naturalistic stimuli tend to have non-Gaussian statistics. In this way the technique is more robust than other dimensionality reduction techniques such as spike-triggered covariance analyses.

An Australian international and New South Wales interstate representative , he played club football in the Newcastle Rugby League for Cessnock, in Sydney's NSWRFL Premiership for Balmain, and also in country Queensland and New South Wales during his career. Parkinson played four seasons in Newcastle for the Cessnock club before moving to Sydney. Signing with the Balmain club, the 1944 NSWRFL season was his first and at the end of it he played in the Premiership Final against Newtown which the Tigers won 12-8. Balmain again reached the final in the 1945 NSWRFL season, which was a 22-18 loss against Eastern Suburbs. The following season Parkinson was selected to play representative football for Sydney against South Coast and was then a surprise selection for Australia, becoming Kangaroo no. 229 when he was chosen to play against the touring Great Britain team. He made several try-saving tackles, which earned him praise as the Kangaroos held Great Britain to an 8-all draw in the first test. Parkinson retained his place for the second test which the British won 14-5. Again playing at fullback in the third test, after only 7 minutes Parkinson was tackled heavily and suffered a broken bone in his ankle. However he continued playing and Australia were further depleted when Arthur Clues was sent off for punching and the Kangaroos lost 20-7. Due to his injury Parkinson missed Balmain's victory over St George in the 1946 premiership decider. The following season he played in Queensland for Babinda as again Balmain won the premiership. Parkinson returned for the 1948 NSWRFL season and once again Balmain reached the premiership decider but lost 8-5 to Western Suburbs. Parkinson played at Parkes in 1949, then rejoined Cessnock in 1950. He played at fullback and kicked goals in each of Cessnock's Newcastle Rugby League grand finals wins of 1950, 1954 and 1955. In 1954 he captained Newcastle in 11-10 and 28-22 wins against Great Britain. Parkinson also enjoyed Newcastle Rugby League premierships with his club, Cessnock in 1954 and 1955.

It contains only the type species Scapanops neglecta, which was named by Rainer R. Schoch and Hans-Dieter Sues in 2013. Scapanops differs from other dissorophids in having a very small skull table, which means that its eye sockets are unusually close to the back of the skull. The eye sockets are also very large and spaced far apart. Scapanops was probably small-bodied (around long) with a proportionally large head and short trunk and tail. Like other dissorophids, it probably spent most of its life on land. Description The only known skull of Scapanops is long. Scapanops is distinguished from other dissorophids by five unique features or autapomorphies: a large spacing between the orbits or eye sockets, giving the skull an oval-shaped outline; a very small skull table behind the orbits; a long snout twice as long as the skull table and proportionally longer than that of any other dissorophid; a jaw jount (the quadrate condyle) positioned farther forward on the skull than it is in other dissorophids; and a skull roof that is covered in small ridges, but not pits as in most other dissorophids. It shares several features (synapomorphies) with the dissorophids Conjunctio and Cacops, including and bony plates called osteoderms that are fused to the vertebrae. The osteoderms form a single row along the back. Scapanops and Conjunctio both have numerous small teeth lining their jaws, suggesting that they ate small prey. Other closely related dissorophids have fewer and larger teeth, meaning that they probably ate larger prey. Discovery Scapanops is known from a single holotype specimen from the Nocona Formation, which is part of the Early Permian red beds of Texas. It includes most of the skull as well as the humerus, radius, and clavicle bones, which are preserved underneath the skull. Several vertebrae, ribs, and osteoderms are also known. The fossil, now housed in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, was discovered by American paleontologist Alfred Romer on April 15, 1950 and was first mentioned in the scientific literature by paleontologist Robert L. Carroll in 1964. During this time it was thought to belong to the species Conjunctio multidens. In 2013 the specimen was recognized to belong to a separate genus, which was named Scapanops after the spade-like shape of its skull (from the Greek skapane). The suffix -ops is meant to associate it with the genus Cacops, a closely related dissorophid. The species name neglectus references the neglected status of the holotype specimen after its initial description in 1964. Relationships A phylogenetic analysis of dissorophids published in 2013 found Scapanops to be one of the most basal members of a clade called Eucacopinae. Eucacopines are characterized by their lightly built skeletons and knobby skulls. The most basal eucacopine was found to be Conjunctio while Scapanops was positioned close to a derived clade of eucacopines that includes the genus Cacops (which is also from the Early Permian of the southwestern United States) and the Russian genera Zygosaurus and Kamacops. While members of the derived eucacopine clade have two rows of osteoderms down their backs, Scapanops and Conjunctio have only a single row of osteoderms down their backs. A single row of osteoderms is thought to be the ancestral condition for the dissorophid clade including Eucacopinae and its sister taxon Dissorophinae. Like the derived eucacopines, dissorophines also have two rows of osteoderms, meaning that the feature evolved independently in both groups and that Scapanops represents the point in eucacopine evolution before the two rows of osteoderms appeared.

He was the son of a lawyer, Jean-Charles Thilorier (1756-1818).According to this source -- Frantz Funck-Brentano, L'Affaire du Collier [The Affair of the Necklace] (Paris, France: Librarie Hachette et Cie., 1901), page 281 footnote. -- Jean-Charles Thilorier was born in 1756 in la Rochelle, France, the son of a lawyer; he had two sons: Adrien and Nicolas- Charles.

Jean-Charles achieved some notoriety:Biographie Universelle Ancienne et Moderne, 2nd ed. (Paris, France: Madame C. Desplaces, 1843-1865), vol. 41, pages 376-377. In 1786, he served as defense attorney to Count Alessandro di Cagliostro in the \\"Affair of the Queen's Necklace\\". In this affair, a French cardinal (the Cardinal de Rohan) tried to ingratiate himself with the queen of France (Marie Antoinette) by buying for her—through intermediaries—a diamond necklace. However, the intermediaries proved to be con men who defrauded the cardinal and the jewelers. Count Cagliostro was suspected of being involved in the fraud and was arrested, but Thilorier won a verdict of not guilty. Jean-Charles was also interested in science and mechanics: He invented a radeau-plongeur (diving wheel) to allow vehicles to cross rivers.See: * (Minutes of the meeting of January 20, 1795), Procès-verbaux des séances de l'Académie [Minutes of meetings of the Academy] (Académie des sciences), 1 : 5, 7, and 33. * Jean- Charles Thilorier, Nouvelle théorie sur la navigation des fleuves (Paris, France: Imprimerie de la rue des Petits-Augustins, 1795).

From page 629: \\"Jean-Jacques Thilorier mourut le 20 juin 1818. 7. rue Neuve-des- Capucines, avec le titre d'avocat aux Conseils du roi. Il était âgé de soixante-deux ans. Il laissiat deux fils dont l'un, Adrien-Jean-Pierre, fut lui-même avocat.\\" (Jean-Jacques Thilorier [this is an error; his correct name was Jean-Charles Thilorier] died on June 20, 1818, at 7 Neuve-des-Capucines Street, with the title lawyer to the King's Council. He was age 62 years. He left two sons, one of whom, Adrien-Jean-Pierre, was himself a lawyer.) Mention of Thilorier's technical work first appeared in 1826: he developed and patented a \\"hydrostatic lamp\\" for lighthouses.Patent 4913: Adrien-Jean Thilorier, \\"Pour une lampe hydrostatique,\\" Description des machines et procédés spécifiés … , 44 : 416-429 (1841); issued: May 12, 1826. As the lamp burned and consumed its oil, a dense aqueous solution of zinc sulfate flowed from the solution's reservoir into the oil reservoir, displacing the oil and thereby maintaining a steady flow of oil to the lamp's wick.For a detailed description and explanation of the hydrostatic lamp, see: Edmund Ronalds and Thomas Richardson, Chemical Technology; or Chemistry in its applications to the arts and manufactures, 2nd ed. (London, England: H. Baillière, 1855), vol. 1, part ii, pages 486-488. By 1828, competing versions of Thilorier's lamp had appeared on the market, and Thilorier was upset by what he regarded as patent infringement. (Thilorier's lamp was a refinement of similar \\"hydrostatic lamps\\", which had been patented by the Girard brothers on 15 December 1804 and by Mr. Verzy on 8 March 1810.) Thilorier asked the French Academy of Sciences to investigate the matter, which they did; but Thilorier didn't receive much satisfaction as the Academy simply stated that the lamps of Thilorier and his competitors were all better than those of the Girard brothers.(Minutes of the meeting of 15 December 1828), Procès-verbaux des séances de l'Académie [Minutes of meetings of the Academy] (Académie des sciences), 9 : 161-163 (1828-1831 ; published: 1921). Nevertheless, Thilorier continued to patent improvements to his lamp in 1828 and 1832 and in 1835.La France industrielle, 2 (14) : 186 (May 1835). In 1835, Thilorier, with Mr. Serrurot (a lamp maker), received a patent for an improved lamp, which was called a lampe- autostatique.La France industrielle, 2 (14) : 188 (May 1835). In 1837, Thilorier, with Mssrs. Serrurot and Sorel, received a patent for an apparatus that heated liquids by using thermal expansion of the liquid and a siphon to circulate liquids between a heater and a holding tank.Patent 5096: Sorel, Thilorier, and Serrurot, \\"Pour le chauffage des liquides par circulation\\" (On the heating of liquids by circulation), Description des machines et procédés spécifiés … , 46 : 71-74 (1842); issued January 11, 1837. The apparatus is illustrated in the lower right-hand corner of page 517. Thilorier's compressor By 1829, Adrien Thilorier had developed a machine for compressing gases. A wealthy French aristocrat, Baron Montyon (1733-1820), had endowed a set of prizes, which were awarded annually by the French Academy. One of the prizes was for mechanical improvements. Thilorier entered his compressor in the competition and won the Montyon prize of 1829–1,500 francs.See: * \\"New compression pump of M. Thilorier,\\" The Athenæum (of London), 1 (85) : 366 (June 10, 1829). * \\"Rapport à l'Académie des Sciences par la commission chargée de décerner en 1829 le prix de mécanique fondé par M. de Montyon\\" [Report to the Academy of Sciences by the committee responsible for awarding in 1829 the prize for mechanics established by M. de Montyon] (session of May 18, 1829), Procès-verbaux des séances de l'Académie [Minutes of meetings of the Academy] (Académie des sciences), 9 : 247-252 (1828-1831 ; published 1921). * \\"Machine à comprimer les gaz; par M. Thilorier\\" (Machine for compressing gases; by Mr. Thilorier), Bulletin des sciences technologiques, 13 : 340-343 (1829). * \\"Machine à comprimer les gaz, par M. Thilorier\\" (Machine for compressing gases; by Mr. Thilorier), Annales de l’industrie française et étrangère, 4 : 132-132 (1829). The compressor consisted of three cylinders: the largest cylinder had a diameter of 7.5 cm and the piston in it had a stroke of 14.6 cm; the intermediate cylinder had a diameter of 2.25 cm and its piston had a stroke of 14.6 cm; the smallest cylinder had a diameter of 0.6 cm and its piston had a stroke of 24.7 cm. The compressor was powered by a rocker arm, which in turn was powered by a team of ten men. The largest and intermediate cylinders were positioned symmetrically on opposite sides of the rocker arm's axis; the smallest cylinder was placed on the same side of the axis as the intermediate cylinder but twice as far from the rocker arm's axis. During one half of each cycle of the rocker arm, each piston would compress the gas within its cylinder; during the next half cycle, the gas would be transferred (presumably through a check valve) to the next cylinder, to be compressed further. The compressor was capable of producing a pressure of 1,000 atmospheres. Thilorier subsequently made several improvements to his compressor. One problem with his original compressor was that the effort that was required to compress the gas was greatest at the bottom of the piston's stroke, at which point the gas's pressure was greatest. Thilorier solved this problem by using a fusée, a device that watch makers used to allow a watch's mainspring to exert a constant torque as the mainspring unwound and its force became weaker. Thilorier reversed the function of the fusée: in his compressor, the fusée allowed a constant force that was supplied by the compressor's source of power (men) to be converted into a force that increased as the piston neared the bottom of its stroke. Thanks to this modification, one man could now power the compressor instead of the ten men that had been required earlier. He also changed the method of cooling the compressor, and he reduced the number of cylinders from three to two. He obtained a patent for this improved compressor.Patent 2896: Thilorier, Adrien-Jean-Pierre, \\"Pour le perfectionnement d'une machine à comprimer le gaz, …\\" (For the improvement of a machine to compress gas, …), Description des Machines et Procédés consignés dans les brevets d'invention, … , 30 : 251-267 (1836); issued: May 16, 1831.A number of journals reproduced the contents of Thilorier's patent application for his pump. See, for example: * Thilorier (1829) \\"Machine à comprimer les gaz\\" (Machine for compressing gases), Bulletin des sciences technologiques, 30 : 340-343. * \\"Rapport fait à l'Academie royale des sciences par M.

Sciences mathématiques et physiques, 4 : 565-589. Thilorier entered his improved compressor in the competition for the Montyon prize of 1830—and again won the prize for mechanical improvements (700 francs).(Minutes of the meeting of July 19, 1830), Procès-verbaux des séances de l'Académie [Minutes of meetings of the Academy] (Académie des sciences), 9 : 447-448 (1828-1831 ; published: 1921) ; page 447: \\"Le no 2, intitulé Perfectionnéments de la pompe à compression, a été déposé par M. Thilorier.\\" (The second place titled Improvements of the compression pump has been collected by Mr. Thilorier.) He foresaw several uses for the products of his compressor: Initially he thought that compressed air could power a cannon.(Minutes of the meeting of July 18, 1831), Procès-verbaux des séances de l'Académie [Minutes of meetings of the Academy] (Académie des sciences), 9 : 665 (1828-1831 ; published: 1921): \\"M. Thilorier annonce que son système de compression de l'air vient d'être appliqué à une machine de guerre par M. Perrault.\\" (Mr. Thilorier announces that his system of air compression will be applied to a war machine of Mr. [Claude] Perrault [(1613-1688)].) However, he later suggested that compressed air could be used to provide a portable source of air for undersea divers (such as Paul Lemaire d'Angerville), to carbonate soda water, to force oils and syrups through filters, to serve as the fluid in a hydraulic press, or to power a vehicle or even a submarine.\\"Pompe à comprimer les gaz, exécutée d'après la théorie qui a obtenu en 1829 le prix de mécanique fondé par M. De Montyon.\\" (Pump for compressing gases, made according to the theory that won in 1829 the prize for mechanics founded by Mr. De Montyon.), Bulletin de la Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale, 19 (315) : 345-366 (September 1830); see especially pages 359-360. In 1832, Thilorier won the Montyon prize for mechanical improvements yet again, after submitting a \\"hydrostatic vacuum pump\\". It was a type of mercury pump: mercury flowed through a tube to which was joined a tube from the vessel that was to be evacuated; the flow of mercury trapped bubbles of air from the vessel and then transported the bubbles away from the vessel.(Minutes of the meeting of Nov. 12, 1832), Procès-verbaux des séances de l'Académie [Minutes of meetings of the Academy] (Académie des sciences), 10 : 151-152 (1832-1835 ; published: 1922). Thilorier was awarded 300 francs. In 1832, French government documents list Thilorier as an employee of the French Post Office, residing in Paris at no. 21 Place Vendôme.

Thilorier's letter is reproduced in: * \\"Lettre de M. Thilorier sur l'acide carbonique solide\\" (Letter from Mr. Thilorier on solid carbonic acid), Comptes rendus … , 3 : 432-434 (1836). * L’Institut, journal universel des sciences et des sociétés savantes en France et à l'étranger, 2 (58) : 197-198 (1834). * A German translation of Thilorier's letter appears in: \\"Flüssigmachung des kohlensauren Gases\\" (Liquefaction of carbonic acid gas), Journal für praktische Chemie, 3 : 109-112 (1834); page 111: \\"Der Apparat, mit Hülfe dessen ich in wenig Augenblicken einen Liter kohlensaures Gas flüssig mache, wird mir eine Erleichterung bei der Untersuchung dieser Verhältnisse an die Hand geben.\\" (The apparatus, with the help of which I make liquid in a few moments a liter of carbonic acid gas, will make available to me some ease during the investigation of these behaviors.) Thilorier's original apparatus for liquefying carbon dioxide used tanks made of cast iron.A description of Thilorier's original apparatus, and an account of its evolution with illustrations is given in: Henry Enfield Roscoe and Carl Schorlemmer, A Treatise on Chemistry (New York, New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1883), vol. 1, page 628-631. However, cast iron is brittle and so there was a danger that such a tank might rupture under pressure. The apparatus could be dangerous: On 30 December 1840, Osmin Hervy, who prepared scientific demonstrations for lectures at the School of Pharmacy in Paris, was operating one of Thilorier's machines when the gas-generating cylinder exploded. Shrapnel broke Hervy's legs, one of which had to be amputated; he died of infection a few days later.See: * Alphonse Chevallier (February 1841) \\"Sur la rupture de l’appareil de M. Thilorer pour la préparation de l’acide carbonique liquide et sur la mort de M. Osmin Hervy, préparateur de l’École de pharmacie\\" (On the rupture of Mr. Thilorier's apparatus for the preparation of liquid carbonic acid and on the death of Mr. Osmin Hervy, preparer of lecture demonstrations of the School of Pharmacy), Journal de chimie médicale, de pharmacie et de toxicologie, … , 2nd series, 7 : 57-73. * \\"Sur l’explosion qui a eu lieu à l’École centrale de pharmacie.

By 1845, the Belgian chemists Daniel-Joseph- Benoît Mareska (1803-1858) and François-Marie-Louis Donny (1822-1896) had replaced the iron with copper and lead.J. Mareska and F. Donny (1845) \\"Mémoire sur un appareil de Thilorier modifié et sur les propriétés de l'acide carbonique liquid et solide\\" (Memoir on a modified Thilorier apparatus and on the properties of liquid and solid carbonic acid), Mémoires couronnés et mémoires des savants étrangers publiés par l'Académie royale des sciences et belles-lettres de Bruxelles, 18 : 1-33. A description of the apparatus and its operation was provided by the French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz:Charles- Adolphe Wurtz, Dictionnaire de chimie pure et appliquée (Paris, France: Librarie Hachette et Cie, 1870), volume 1, part 2 , page 751. > The apparatus is composed of a generator and a receptacle; the generator is > a cylindrical lead boiler, covered with red copper and reinforced with > pieces of forged iron. The capacity of this boiler is 6-7 liters. The > generator is suspended between the two points of a cast iron base. The > receptacle is formed from a vessel of lead contained in a cylinder of copper > surrounded by rings of iron. The opening of the generator is sealed by a > screw cap, pierced along its [i.e., the cap's] axis and fitted with a valve. > The receptacle likewise bears an opening on its upper edge; one inserts in > this opening a copper tube which descends almost to the bottom of the > receptacle and which is fitted on the outside with a valve. One establishes > a connection between the receptacle and the generator by means of a copper > tube. In order to produce carbonic acid, one introduces into the generator > 1,800 grams of sodium bicarbonate, 4½ liters of water at about 35° [C, > 95°F], and a cylindrical copper cup containing 1 kilogram of concentrated > sulfuric acid; one places it [i.e., the copper cup] along the axis of the > generator, one closes it [i.e., the generator] and one rocks it around its > axis [i.e., the two points of support of the cast iron base], in a way that > the acid flows and reacts with the bicarbonate; at the end of ten minutes > one opens the valves in order to allow the carbonic acid to pass into the > receptacle. The acid distills by virtue of the difference in temperature > that exists between the two parts of the apparatus; one proceeds to a new > preparation of carbonic acid that one allows to pass in the same way into > the receptacle; by repeating [this procedure] five or six times, one can > accumulate up to 2 liters of liquid [carbonic acid]. Thilorier was not the first person to liquefy carbon dioxide: Michael Faraday had liquefied it in 1823.Michael Faraday (1823) \\"On the condensation of several gases into liquids,\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 113 : 189-198; see especially pages 193-194. However, with an ample and reliable supply of liquid carbon dioxide, Thilorier was able to observe and measure its properties, such as its vapor density and its extraordinary rate of expansion with temperature, under a wide range of conditions.See: * \\"Flüssigmachung des kohlensauren Gases\\" (Liquefaction of carbonic acid gas), Journal für praktische Chemie, 3 : 109-112 (1834). * \\"Liquefaction und Solidification der Kohlensäure,\\" Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 36 : 141-148 (1835). * Thilorier (1835) \\"Propriétés de l'acide carbonique liquide\\" (Properties of liquid carbonic acid), Comptes rendus … , 1 : 163-166. * Thilorier (1835) \\"Propriétés de l'acide carbonique liquide\\" (Properties of liquid carbonic acid), Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 60 : 427-431.

First production of \\"dry ice\\" At the 12 October 1835 meeting of the French Academy of Sciences, a letter from Adrien Thilorier was read in which he stated that he had solidified carbon dioxide:See: * Thilorier (1835) \\"Solidification de l’acide carbonique\\" (Solidification of carbonic acid), Comptes rendus … , 1 : 194-196. * Thilorier (1835) \\"Solidification de l’acide carbonique\\" (Solidification of carbonic acid), Annales de chimie et de physique, series 2, 60 : 432-434. Available on- line at: University of Ghent > Original: Si l'on dirige un jet d'acide carbonique dans l'intérieur d'une > petite fiole de verre, elle se remplit promptement, et presque en entier, > d'une matièr blanche, pulvérulente, floconneuse, qui adhère fortement aux > parois, et qu'on ne peut retirer qu'en brisant la bouteille. > Translation: If one directs a jet of [liquid] carbonic acid [i.e., carbon > dioxide] into the interior of a small glass vial, it quickly fills, and > almost completely, with a material [that is] white, powdery, fluffy, which > adheres strongly to the walls [of the vial], and which one can remove only > by breaking the bottle. What is particularly interesting about Thilorier's discovery of dry ice is that he did not realize that he had solidified carbon dioxide until a group of scientists from the French Academy of Sciences explained to him what he had accomplished:Thilorier (1835), Comptes rendus … , page 196. > Original: M. Thénard fait remarquer que M. Thilorier n'avait pas encore > imaginé, au moment de la visite des commissaires de l'Académie, que la > substance blanchâtre obtenue par lui fût de l'acide carbonique solide. Ce > fait, dit-il, a été reconnue et constaté par la commission: c'est elle qui a > soumis l'acide à la plupart des expériences citées par l'auteur. > Translation: Mr. Thénard [i.e., French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard (1777 – > 1857)] noted that Mr. Thilorier had still not imagined, at the time of the > visit of commissioners of the Academy, that the whitish substance obtained > by him was solid carbonic acid. This fact, he says, was recognized and noted > by the committee: it is they who submitted the acid to most of the > experiments cited by the author [i.e., Thilorier]. Thilorier thought that the liquid carbon dioxide had caused water vapor in the air to freeze on the vial; he was puzzled when the \\"snow\\" sublimated instead of melting.See: * Paul Thénard, Un grand Français: Le chimiste Thénard (1777-1857) (Dijon, France: Imprimerie Jobard, 1950), p. 177. * Thomas O'Conor Sloane, Liquid Air and the Liquefaction of Gases: A Practical Work … , 3rd. ed (New York, New York: Norman W. Henley Publishing Co., 1920), page 138. Thilorier reported to the French Academy of Sciences the properties of solid carbon dioxide. News of Thilorier's achievement was published not only within France but in Germany, Britain, and the United States.See: * \\"Liquefaction und Solidification der Kohlensäure,\\" Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 36 : 141-148 (1835). * \\"Solidification of carbonic acid,\\" The London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, 8 : 446-447 (1836). * \\"Solidification of carbonic acid,\\" The American Journal of Science and Arts, 31 : 163, 404-405 (1837). The French positivist Auguste Comte was so impressed by Thilorier's investigations of gases that he devoted the twentieth day of the ninth month of his positivist calendar to British chemist John Dalton—and to Thilorier.See: * Auguste Comte, Calendrier positiviste … , 4th ed. (1852). * Frederic Harrison, ed. The New Calendar of Great Men (London, England: Macmillan and Co., 1892) page 407. When dry ice was mixed with diethyl ether, it was called \\"Thilorier's mixture\\",Faraday, Michael (1845) \\"On the liquefaction and solidification of bodies generally existing as gases,\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 135 : 155-172, 172-177 ; from page 157: \\"For the application of cold to these tubes a bath of Thilorier's mixture of solid carbonic acid and ether was used.\\"Yorgos Goudaroulis (1994) \\"Searching for a name: the development of the concept of the critical point (1822-1867),\\" Revue d'histoire des sciences, 47 : 353-380 ; see especially page 366. presumably since Thilorier had noted in 1835 that a mixture of liquid carbon dioxide and ether produced extreme cold when sprayed on objects.Thilorier (1835) \\"Propriétés de l'acide carbonique liquide\\" (Properties of liquid carbonic acid), Comptes rendus … , 1 : 163-166. On page 165, he mentions mixing liquid carbon dioxide with ethanol and with diethyl ether; on page 166, he mentions the extreme cold that a mixture of ether and liquid carbon dioxide can produce. It was subsequently found that under reduced pressure, temperatures as low as −110 °C could be maintained.Harry C. Jones, Introduction to Physical Chemistry (New York, New York: The Macmillan Co., 1910), pp. 40-41. These mixtures (\\"dry ice baths\\") could thus be used to maintain low temperatures during experiments. Mistaken identification Unfortunately, in almost all of his technical articles, Adrien Thilorier gave his name simply as \\"Thilorier\\";However, his name is given as \\"A. Thilorier\\" in one article: A. Thilorier (1836) \\"Acide carbonique liquéfié et solidifié\\" (Liquefied and solidified carbonic acid), Journal de chimie médicale, de pharmacie et de toxicologie, 2nd series, 2 : 3-8. similarly, whenever others referred to him in technical articles, his name was also given only as \\"Thilorier\\". This impeded efforts by scholars to identify him subsequently.Even a brief (romanticized) biographical article about Thilorier didn't mention his first name. See: Samuel-Henry Berthoud, Les Petites chroniques de la science (Paris, France: Garnier Frères, 1861), volume 2, pages 180-186. The confusion was compounded when Paul Thénard wrote a biography of his father, Louis Thénard, the chemist who explained to Thilorier in 1835 that his \\"snow\\" was actually solidified carbon dioxide. In a footnote of that biography, Paul Thénard identified the \\"Thilorier\\" who discovered dry ice as \\"Charles-Saint-Ange Thilorier\\", a student at the École polytechnique in the class of 1815.Paul Thénard (1950), p. 176. This (mistaken) identification was mentioned by Duane H. D. Roller, a graduate student at Harvard University, in a paper that was published in 1952.Duane H. D. Roller (1952) \\"Thilorier and the first solidification of a \\"permanent\\" gas (1835)\\", Isis, 43 : 109-113 ; see especially page 111. Consequently, many sources claim that Charles-Saint- Ange Thilorier discovered dry ice. During the 1960s, Madeleine Ambrière- Fargeaud, a scholar in France, was trying to identify the person who served as the model for a \\"mad scientist\\" character, Balthazar Claës, in Honoré de Balzac's novel La Recherche de l’absolu (The Quest of the Absolute). Her research suggested that Claës was inspired (in part) by Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier.Madeleine Ambrière-Fargeaud, Balzac et \\"La Recherche de l’absolu\\", 2nd ed. (Paris, France: Presses Universitaires de France, 1999), pp. 91-107. By 2003, Joost Mertens, a Dutch historian of science, had verified many of the findings that Ms. Ambrière-Fargeaud had made about Thilorier. That \\"Thilorier\\" is actually Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier is proved by French government documents, especially patents. His 1826 patent for a hydrostatic lamp lists his name as \\"Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)\\" of Paris. His 1831 patent for a gas compressor also lists his name as \\"Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)\\" and describes him as an employee of the \\"Administration des postes\\" (i.e., the Post Office) in Paris. In 1832, the Bulletin of the laws of the kingdom of France also lists him as \\"Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)\\" and as an employee of the Post Office, who resided at number 21 on the Place Vendôme in Paris, and as the inventor of a gas compressor.The Bulletin des Lois du Royaume de France (Bulletin of the laws of the kingdom of France), 9th series, part ii, no. 92, page 74 (February 1832) lists: \\"24° M. Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre) employé à l'administration des postes, demeurant à Paris, place Vendôme, no 21, auquel il a été délivré le 16 mai dernier, le certificat de sa demande d'un brevet d'invention de dix ans pour le perfectionnement d'une machine à comprimer le gaz; …\\" (24th Mr. Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre) employed at the Post Office, residing in Paris, Place Vendôme, no. 21, where was delivered May 16th last, the certificate, by his request, for a patent of invention for ten years for the improvement of a machine to compress gas; … ) In 1835, the government bulletin La France industrielle lists him as \\"Thilorier (Adrien- Jean-Pierre)\\" residing at no. 4 on rue de Bouloi in Paris and as the recipient of a patent for a hydrostatic lamp.La France industrielle, 2 (14) : 186, 188 (May 1835) lists Adrien Thilorier by his full name as the recipient (p. 186) or co-recipient (p. 188) of patent for a hydrostatic lamp. On both pages he is listed as a ferblantier (tinsmith) residing at \\"rue de Bouloi no. 4\\" in Paris. In 1836, The London Journal of Arts and Sciences; and Repertory of Patent Inventions lists him by his full name as the recipient of a patent for a hydrostatic lamp.The London Journal of Arts and Sciences; and Repertory of Patent Inventions, 8 : 118 (1836).

Early life H. Henry Baxter, the son of Judge Henry Baxter, was born in Saxtons River, Vermont on January 8, 1818. He attended schools in Windham and Windsor Counties and at age 15 he became a clerk in a Boston dry goods commission warehouse. He worked in Boston for two years and became a supervisor of employees as the warehouse's head bookkeeper.Henry Hall, editor, America's Successful Men of Affairs, 1895, page 65-66 In the mid-1830s Baxter returned to Vermont, after securing the financing to open his own dry goods store in Bellows Falls. Having extended credit to his customers during the Panic of 1837, Baxter did not receive timely repayment. He closed the store when he was unable to run it profitably.Atlantic Publishing and Engraving, Memorial: H. Henry Baxter; Born January 18th, 1818, Died February 17, 1884, 1884, page 7 Business career Despite bouts of ill health usually caused by overwork, Baxter was a large man with commanding presence. Drawing on these traits and his experience managing employees in Boston, in the early 1840s Baxter bid successfully for the contract to grade rail bed and lay track for the Rutland and Burlington Railroad. Baxter personally supervised his workers, and completed the Rutland and Burlington contract successfully. His success led to construction work for other railroads, including the Western Vermont and Cleveland and Toledo. Baxter then settled in Rutland and purchased the Rutland Marble Company.Henry Perry Smith, William S.

The game revolves around a freelance investigative journalist, Miles Upshur, who decides to investigate a remote psychiatric hospital named Mount Massive Asylum, located deep in the mountains of Lake County, Colorado. The downloadable content Outlast: Whistleblower centers on Waylon Park, the man who led Miles there in the first place. Outlast was released for Microsoft Windows on September 4, 2013, PlayStation 4 on February 4, 2014 and for Xbox One on June 19, 2014. Linux and OS X versions were later released on March 31, 2015. A Nintendo Switch version titled Outlast: Bundle of Terror was released in February 2018. Outlast received generally positive reviews, with praise for its atmosphere, horror elements, and gameplay. As of October 2016, the game has sold four million copies. As of May 2018, the whole series has sold fifteen million copies. A sequel, Outlast 2, was released on April 25, 2017, while a third installment, The Outlast Trials, is set to be released in 2021. The Murkoff Account, a comic book series set between Outlast and Outlast 2, was released in July of the same year.  Gameplay  The player can see the environment and other enemies in the dark by using the night vision mode on their camcorder. In Outlast, the player assumes the role of investigative journalist Miles Upshur, as he navigates a dilapidated psychiatric hospital in Leadville, Colorado that is overrun by homicidal patients. The game is played from a first-person perspective and features some stealth gameplay mechanics. The player can walk, run, crouch, jump, climb ladders and vault over objects. Unlike most games, however, the player doesn't have a visible health bar on the screen and is unable to attack enemies. The player must instead rely on stealth tactics such as hiding in lockers, sneaking past enemies, staying in the shadows and hiding behind or under things in order to survive. Alternatively, the player can attempt to outrun their pursuer. If the player dies, the game will reset to the most recent checkpoint. Most of the hospital is unlit, and the only way for the player to see while in the dark is through the lens of a camcorder equipped with night vision. Using the night vision mode will slowly consume batteries, forcing the player to scavenge for additional batteries found throughout the asylum. Outlast makes heavy use of traditional jump scares and audio cues, which alert the player if an enemy has seen them. If the player records specific events with their camcorder, Miles will write a note about it, providing further insight into his thoughts. Documents can be collected, which offer backstory and other expository information about the facility, including pages taken from the diaries of patients and reports from the hospital staff. Developer Red Barrels have pointed to the survival-focused gameplay in Amnesia: The Dark Descent as a primary influence on the combat-free narrative style of Outlast. Found-footage horror films like Quarantine and REC also served as influences.  Plot  Freelance investigative journalist Miles Upshur receives an anonymous email that inhumane experiments are being conducted at Mount Massive Asylum, a private psychiatric hospital owned by the notoriously unethical Murkoff Corporation. Upon entering, Miles is shocked to discover its halls ransacked and littered with the mutilated corpses of the staff. He is informed by a dying officer of Murkoff's private military unit that Mount Massive's deranged inmates, known as \\"variants\\", have escaped and are freely roaming the grounds, butchering Murkoff's employees. The officer implores him to leave, but Miles finds he cannot return the way he came and must press on. As Miles searches for an exit, he is ambushed by a hulking variant named Chris Walker, who hurls him through a window into the lobby, knocking him unconscious. While incapacitated, Miles encounters Father Martin Archimbaud, a self-anointed priest with schizotypal personality disorder, who claims Miles is his \\"apostle\\" and sabotages his escape by cutting off power to the front doors. Miles restores power, but Father Martin injects him with anesthetic. He shows Miles footage of \\"the Walrider\\", an entity killing patients and personnel alike, which he claims is responsible for the asylum's ransacking. Regaining consciousness, Miles finds himself trapped in a decaying cell block filled with catatonic and demented patients. He escapes through the sewers to the main wards, pursued by Walker and two cannibalistic twins, only to be captured by Rick Trager, a former Murkoff executive driven insane like the other inmates. Trager straps Miles to a wheelchair and amputates two of his fingers with a pair of bone shears, preparing to do the same to his tongue and genitals. However, Miles escapes Trager and flees to the elevator, inadvertently crushing Trager between floors when he attacks him. Miles ventures further into the hospital and reconvenes with Father Martin, who tells him to go to the asylum's chapel. Reaching an auditorium, Miles learns that the Walrider was created by Dr. Rudolf Gustav Wernicke, a German scientist brought to the United States during Operation Paperclip. Wernicke believed that intensive dream therapy conducted on traumatized patients could connect swarms of nanites into a single malevolent being. Miles finds Father Martin crucified in the chapel, who gives Miles a key to the atrium elevator that he insists will take him to freedom before immolating himself. Miles takes the elevator, which descends into a subterranean laboratory. Walker attacks him, only to be eviscerated by the Walrider. Miles locates an aged Wernicke, who confirms that the Walrider is a biotechnological nanite entity controlled by Billy Hope, a comatose subject of Murkoff's experiments. He orders Miles to terminate Billy's life support in the hopes that this will destroy the Walrider. Miles accomplishes this task; however, just before Billy dies, the Walrider attacks Miles and possesses his body. On his way out of the laboratory, Miles encounters a Murkoff military team led by Wernicke, which guns him down. A horrified Wernicke realizes that Miles is the Walrider's new host. Panicked screams and gunfire are heard as the screen fades to black. = Whistleblower DLC = Waylon Park is a software engineer working at Mount Massive Asylum for Murkoff. His job entails maintaining the Morphogenic Engine, which controls lucid dreaming in comatose individuals. After several experiences working directly with the Engine and witnessing its effects on the facility's patients, he sends an anonymous e-mail to reporter Miles Upshur to expose the corporation. Shortly afterwards, Park is summoned to the underground laboratory's operations center to debug a monitoring system. When he returns to his laptop, his supervisor Jeremy Blaire has him detained and subjected to the Morphogenic Engine after discovering his email. However, when the Walrider is unleashed (which leads to the events in the main story), Park escapes and takes a camcorder. He roams the increasingly decrepit facility as surviving guards and medical personnel try to evade the newly freed patients, searching for a shortwave radio that he can use to contact the authorities, all the while eluding a cannibal named Frank Manera, who wields an electric bone saw. Just as Park manages to find a working radio transmitter, Blaire appears and subdues him, destroying the transmitter and leaving Park to die. Park finds his way into the asylum's vocational block where he is chased by Eddie Gluskin, a serial killer obsessed with finding the \\"perfect bride\\" by killing other patients and mutilating their genitalia. Gluskin captures Park and tries to hang him in a gymnasium with his other victims, but during the struggle, he becomes entangled in his pulley system and impaled by a loose section of rebar. At daybreak, Murkoff's paramilitary division arrives at the asylum, intent on eliminating the variants. Park slips past them and escapes into the main lobby. There, he finds a gravely wounded Blaire, who stabs him suddenly, insisting that no one can know the truth about Mount Massive, but the Walrider kills him before he can finish Park off. Park then stumbles out the open front door and towards Miles Upshur's jeep, which is still idling near the main gates. He takes the jeep and drives away as Miles, now the Walrider's host, also emerges from the asylum. In the epilogue, Park is sitting at a laptop with the videos ready for upload to expose the Murkoff Corporation. An associate informs him that it will be more than enough to ruin Murkoff, but is warned that they will then seek to eliminate him and his family. Despite some initial hesitation, Park decides to upload the file.  Release  Outlast was released on September 4, 2013, for download through Steam, and it was released on February 4, 2014, for the PlayStation 4 as the free monthly title for PlayStation Plus users. The downloadable content, Outlast: Whistleblower, serves as an overlapping prequel to the original game. The plot follows Waylon Park, the anonymous tipster to Miles Upshur and shows the events both before and after the main plotline. The Microsoft Windows version of Whistleblower was released on May 6, 2014, worldwide, the PlayStation 4 version was launched on May 6, 2014, in North America and on May 7, 2014, in Europe, and the Xbox One version launched on June 18 in North America and Europe. Linux and OS X versions were later released on March 31, 2015. In December 2017, Red Barrels announced that Outlast, including Whistleblower and the sequel Outlast 2, will be coming to the Nintendo Switch in early 2018. The title was released by surprise on February 27, 2018 under the title Outlast: Bundle of Terror via Nintendo eShop.  Reception  As of October 19, 2016, Outlast has sold over 4 million copies. Outlast received positive reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Xbox One version 80/100 based on 6 reviews, the Microsoft Windows version 80/100 based on 59 reviews, and the PlayStation 4 version 78/100 based on 33 reviews. It has been received with a number of accolades and awards from E3 2013, including the \\"Most Likely to Make you Faint\\" honor, and one of \\"Best of E3\\". The PC gaming website Rock, Paper, Shotgun gave Outlast a very positive review, noting that \\"Outlast is not an experiment in how games can be scary, it’s an exemplification.\\" Marty Sliva of IGN rated the game with a score of 7.8, praising the horror elements and gameplay while criticizing the environments and character modeling. GameSpot gave the game a positive review as well stating that \\"Outlast isn't really a game of skill, and as it turns out, that makes sense. You're not a cop or a soldier or a genetically enhanced superhero. You're just a reporter. And as a reporter, you don't possess many skills with which you can fend off the hulking brutes, knife-wielding stalkers, and other homicidal maniacs who lurk in the halls of the dilapidated Mount Massive Asylum. You can't shoot them, or punch them, or rip pipes from the walls to clobber them with. You can only run and hide\\".  Sequels  On October 23, 2014, in an interview with Bloody Disgusting, Red Barrels revealed that due to the success of Outlast, a sequel was in development. It was initially intended to be released in late 2016, but was delayed to early 2017 due to complications during development. Subsequently, the release date was further pushed to Q2 2017, despite the intended Q1 2017 release. On March 6, 2017, Red Barrels announced that a physical bundle called Outlast Trinity would be released for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on April 25. The sequel, titled Outlast 2, was made digitally available for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on April 25, 2017; and came to the Nintendo Switch, alongside Outlast, in February 2018. It takes place in the same universe as the first game, but features a new storyline with different characters, set in the Arizona desert. Outlast 3 was announced in December 2017, though no time frame or target platforms were confirmed. During this announcement, Red Barrels said that because they could not easily add downloadable content for Outlast 2, they had a smaller separate project related to Outlast that would be released before Outlast 3. The project, teased in October 2019, is a prequel for Outlast 2, called The Outlast Trials, and is a horror game set in the Cold War. The game is in its early development stages, with a set 2021 release date.

It is a member of the family Tubulariidae. These animals usually grow embedded in sponges.Millard, N.A.H. 1975. Monograph on the Hydroida of Southern Africa. Ann. S. Afr. Mus. 68:1-513 Description The tubular sponge hydroid grows to about tall. It has a fat stem and a daisy-like polyp with sparse tentacles surrounding a group of reproductive sporosacs which in turn surround the pink and white oral tentacles. The body of the hydranths (feeding individuals) as well as the gonophores (reproductive polyps) are pinky red, while the tentacles are transparent white.Branch, G.M.; Branch, M.L.; Griffiths, C.L.; Beckley, L.E. 2010. Two Oceans: a guide to the marine life of southern Africa. . Distribution and habitat This species is found around the South African coast from Saldanha Bay to KwaZulu-Natal as well as off the Cape Verde Islands, Trinidad and Bermuda. It is also known from Brazil, Colombia, the Netherlands Antilles, Puerto Rico and Japan. It occurs in various habitats where the sponges on which it feeds live, including rocky shores, quiet coastal waters, bays and on mangrove roots. It is known from the subtidal to at least underwater. Ecology At breeding time, female gonophores contain one to four actinulae (mobile tentaculate larvae), and these are released into the water column in a series of pulsations over the course of a few minutes. They can not actively swim but are attracted towards suitable species of sponge on which to settle, and may be attracted by the presence of chemical cues emitted by the sponge. They can settle within ten minutes on favourable substrates and can survive for about three days if no suitable substrate can be found. When settled, they quickly undergo metamorphosis and the new polyps that form develop tentacles and start feeding in about two days.

Abdul Rashid Dostum had previously commanded the Jozjani militia, which later became the 53rd Infantry Division. Numbering 40,000 men drawn from the Uzbek minority, it took its orders directly from Mohammad Najibullah. It was later termed as the 'only real mobile reserve' available to the regime.Antonio Giustozzi, War, Politics, and Society in Afghanistan, 2000, 222, citing another analyst.

It was originally an Isma'ili-sponsored tribal Sarandoy (Interior Ministry) regiment/brigade. In 1989 it was the major formation in Baghlan Province, under the command of Sayed Jafar Naderi, the then 25-year-old son of Sayed Mansoor Naderi, 53, the religious leader of the minor Isma\`ili Islamic sect in Afghanistan.Howard Witt, Where Warlords Still Reign Father And Son Keep Peace In Afghan Province, Chicago Tribune, June 25, 1989.

The corps was reportedly formed in 1990.Antonio Giustozzi, War, Politics and Society, 2000, p.77. General Khodaidad reportedly became chief of staff of the corps and commander of the 54th Division that year. On 18 April 1992, Kunduz, the corps headquarters, was surrendered to the Mujahideen. The corps consisted at the time of the 20th Division, 54th Division, and 80th Division (Kiligai?), and the city hosted the corps headquarters and the 54th Division headquarters.Anthony Davis, 'The Afghan Army,' Jane's Intelligence Review, March 1993, cited in Nils Wormer, 'The Networks of Kunduz,' Afghanistan Analysts Network Report 02/2012, p.10 The divisional commander of 54th Division, an ethnic Pashtun, handed over the divisional base complete to the Ittehad-e-Islami leader in the Kunduz area, commander Amir Chughay.

The force was theoretically 120,000 men strong, equipped with large amounts of armour and artillery, spread across seven of Afghanistan's provinces, from Maimana, to Sheberghan, home of the 53rd Division, to Pul-i- Khumri in the east. The actual total of full-time troops probably stood at around half that number. By mid-1994 there were two parallel 6th Corps operating in the north. Dostum's 6th Corps was based at Pul-i-Khumri and had three divisions: the 20th Division (Bagh-i-Momtaz, south of Baghlan), the 54th Division (Samangan), and the 80th Division (Qilagai/Kiligai), controlled by the Naderi clan that presides over the Ismaeli. The Defence Ministry of the Kabul government's 6th Corps was based at Kunduz and also had three divisions, two sharing numbers with formations in Dostum's corps.Anthony Davies, JIR, July 1994 Davis in JIR 1994 lists the 20th, 54th, 55th and Bakakhstan Divisions.

He is a member of the Simpson political family of Wyoming. From 1981-84, he was a member of the Wyoming House of Representatives from Sheridan, where at the time he was employed in administration by the community college, Sheridan College. In 1986, Simpson was the Wyoming Republican gubernatorial nominee. He polled 46 percent of the vote in his race against the Democrat Michael J. SullivanWyoming Secretary of State, General election returns, November 4, 1986 of Douglas in Converse County in southeastern Wyoming. In a nationally Democratic year, Sullivan defeated Simpson for the right to succeed Democrat Edgar Herschler. Biography A native of Cody in Park County, Wyoming, Simpson is one of two sons of the late Governor and U.S. Senator Milward L. Simpson and Lorna (née Kooi; 1900-1995), a native of Chicago. The senior Simpson was a lawyer and businessman remembered for his political career. Mrs. Simpson worked in the radio station KODI, the Cody Enterprise newspaper, and the management of their family-owned Cody Inn. She served on the municipal planning and zoning commission, in which capacity she worked in a campaign to beautify Cody into one of Wyoming's most attractive cities and a mecca of tourism. Pete Simpson's great-grandparents, Maggie and John Simpson, platted and named Jackson, Wyoming. Another great-grandparent, Finn Burnett, knew Sacajawea and was an advisor the Shoshone chief, Washakie. Pete Simpson and his brother, former state representative and U.S. Senator Alan K. Simpson, both carry their mother's maiden name as their middle name. Pete Simpson is an uncle of former State Representative Colin M. Simpson of Cody, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in the Republican primary election held on August 17, 2010 . The nomination and the general election on November 2 went to Matt Mead, a member of another Wyoming Republican political family, the Hansens, referring to former Governor and former U.S. Senator Clifford Hansen. Colin Simpson was Wyoming House Speaker in his last term from 2009 to 2010. Simpson graduated in 1953 from the University of Wyoming in Laramie, where he was a member of the student senate, lettered in basketball with the UW Cowboys, and received a Bachelor of Arts, the first of his three degrees in the field of history. After four years in the United States Navy, he moved to Billings, Montana, where he starred in a local television program and became involved in folk music. Academic career Simpson returned to University of Wyoming and in 1962 earned his Master of Arts degree, with his thesis, A History of the First Wyoming Legislature. He would be a member of that body some two decades thereafter. Simpson thereafter earned his Ph.D. from the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon. His dissertation on the cattle industry was later published as a book, \\"The Community of Cattlemen: A Social History of the Cattle Industry in Southeastern Oregon, 1869-1912,\\" (Moscow: University of Idaho Press, 1987). He is a member of the fraternity Alpha Tau Omega. In the early 1970s, Simpson returned to Wyoming to accept a position as the assistant to the president at Casper College in Casper, the state's second largest city. He then became dean of instruction at Sheridan College. After his legislative service ended in 1984, Simpson left Sheridan to become vice president for development at the University of Wyoming and the executive director of the UW Foundation. He resigned from UW to run for governor but returned in 1987 as vice president for development and alumni affairs. Thereafter, he was elevated to his terminal position of UW vice president for institutional advancement. After retirement in 1997, Simpson remained in Laramie and taught history on an adjunct basis at UW and was in 1999 and 2000 the Milward Simpson Distinguished Visiting Professor, named for his father. The Simpson Fund has financed various speakers of different backgrounds and disciplines to UW, including former United States Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, former United States Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt, U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., and ABC journalist Sam Donaldson. Over the years, Simpson has emceed various UW events. In 2009, he was inducted for \\"Special Achievement\\" into the UW Athletics Hall of Fame. While at UW, Simpson and his brother, Alan, were invited to team teach for one semester only by the political science department, but Pete Simpson was still teaching the course twelve years later. After he left the U.S. Senate, Alan Simpson became a lecturer for several years for the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, but he returned to Cody in 2000 to practice law with his two sons, Colin and William Simpson. Long involved in civic affairs, Pete Simpson in 2010 joined his former gubernatorial rival, Mike Sullivan, at a fundraising appearance in Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming for the benefit of the library in Sweetwater County. Pete Simpson narrated the hour-long documentary Over Wyoming which was produced by WyomingPBS in 2016. Political career During his four-year stint in the legislature, Simpson was a member of the House Appropriations Committee. Two years after leaving the state House, he waged a hard-fought race for governor but fell short. UW history professor Phil Roberts suggested that the principal reason that Pete Simpson may have lost that race to Mike Sullivan was that Alan Simpson was already serving in his second term in the U.S. Senate: \\"There are a number of people that speculate because there already was a Simpson in the Senate, they probably wanted just one Simpson at a time.\\" Roberts said that family names have been less important in Wyoming politics than in other states with prominent political families. That view held true when, in 2014, when Liz Cheney, daughter of former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, challenged Alan Simpson's Senate successor, Mike Enzi in the Republican primary. Enzi won the election. Personal life Simpson and his wife, the former Lynne Alice Livingston left Laramie around 2011 to return to Cody. Their younger son, Peter K. Simpson, Jr. is an Obie Award- winning actor and long time performer, writer, director and trainer for Blue Man Group. In 2010, he appeared at UW as Prince Hamlet in a theatre production of the Shakespearean play, with Pete Simpson cast as the Ghost of Hamlet's father. The junior Simpson recalls, with \\"the ghost and son scene, ... I could feel an energy shift in the room. It was hard not to get misty eyed.\\" The older son, Milward Allen Simpson (born 1962), is the director of the Wyoming Department of State Parks and Cultural Resources, first under Democratic Governor Dave Freudenthal and under current Republican Governor Matt Mead. This Milward Simpson had been mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for governor at the same time that his cousin, Colin Simpson, sought the Republican nomination against Matt Mead for the office that the Simpsons' paternal grandfather held from 1955–59, before both had been born. Milward Allen Simpson said that his political values as a Democrat are identical to those that his grandfather \\"instilled in us -– is that it's important to be who you are and stand up for what you believe in, and be honest and truthful. ... It doesn't really matter what your party stripe is, if you love the state and you want to serve it, that's what you've got to do. ... Blood's much thicker than partisan politics.\\" The middle child is daughter, Margaret Ann Simpson-Crabaugh who is an actress, singer/songwriter and teaches Enneagram workshops.I am their daughter, Margaret Ann Simpson-Crabaugh In 2011, the UW Alumni Association honored Pete Simpson with its Medallion Service Award, first issued in 1968 but not given annually. It recognizes outstanding dedication and service to the university. In June 2012, still involved in occasional acting, Simpson played the celebrated frontiersman William F. Cody at the opening of the redesigned Cody museum at the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody. The Peter K. Simpson papers from 1977 to 2009, the majority from his politica career from 1980 to 1987, are located in the UW archives in Laramie.

In 1919 the painting was exhibited in Paris at Léonce Rosenberg's, Galerie de l'Effort Moderne. The painting was reproduced in the June 1924 (n. 6) issue of Bulletin de l'Effort Moderne.Bulletin de l'Effort moderne, June 1924, No. 6, reproduced, titled Melon et compotier, dated 1919 The work is on view at Charlotte F. and Irving W. Rabb Gallery (Europe, 1900–1960, Modernism), Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Description Fruit and a Jug on a Table is an oil and sand on canvas, signed JMetzinger, lower left, and inscribed on the reverse; Peint par moi / en 1916 / Metzinger.Joann Moser, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, with Daniel Robbins, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, 1985 The work represents a divers grouping of objects—a bowl of fruit, a carafe (or jug), a glass, and a bottle labelled BANYU. Banyuls-sur-Mer is a commune in the Pyrénées-Orientales department in southern France, located near Cerbère and Collioure. The foothills of Pyrenees run into the Mediterranean Sea in Banyuls-sur-Mer, creating a steep cliff line. Banyuls-sur-Mer is known for its wines, such as the sweet wine Banyuls: a fortified apéritif or dessert wine made from old vines cultivated in terraces on the slopes of the French and Catalan Pyrenees. The arrangement of objects on the table separated from the background, the moderation of colors, and the curvilinear structuring contrasts from the highly chromatic and sharp angular modeling of Metzinger's 1916 works, suggesting this work may have been completed in 1917 or 1918. History Following World War I Metzinger moved increasingly toward a classical treatment of subjects—as Picasso and several other Cubists—in response to both a growing interest in the classicism and pressures of post- war conservatism; a phenomenon that would encompass a wide range of sectors including music, philosophy, literature and the fine-arts.Alex Mittelmann, 2012, Jean Metzinger, Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post Cubism Paul Cézanne, 1890-1894, Fruit and a Jug on a Table, oil on canvas, 32.4 x 40.6 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Paul Cézanne, c.1895, La vase paillé (Ginger Jar and Fruit), oil on canvas, 73 x 60 cm, Barnes Foundation, Pennsylvania Fruit and a Jug on a Table has many characteristic features one would expect to find in Metzinger's work between 1916 and 1919. This painting shows Metzinger on the verge of adopting a more naturalistic stance. Space is increasingly recessive, surface fracturing is more subdued. Though the geometry remains non-Euclidean and perspective in the tradition of Paul Cézanne—as observed in the angle of the table in relation to the objects placed upon it—mobile perspective is almost entirely vacated. Decorative patterns are more restrained, yet surface textures and a thick application of paint enlivening the flat color areas persist as an essential feature of Metzinger's oeuvre. Considered Cubist in critical circles, the work no longer possess the abrupt angular faceting of Metzinger's pre-1916 Cubism. Colors are consistently anti- natural; forms are rounded, clearly delineated by omnidirectional light and shadow. The geometric armature is reduced to elemental building blocks. Perspective is tightly packed and limited to a depth of field equivalent to a raised relief, as if carved out of stone. Brushwork is dynamic and expressive. The composition is constructed in a vertical format, focusing on the interconnectedness and relationships between divers parts. Provenance In April 1919, the painting was with Léonce Rosenberg, Galerie de l'Effort Moderne, Paris.Collection de Léonce Rosenberg, marchand d'art, Jean Metzinger, Nature morte, Ministère de la Culture (France) – Médiathèque de l'architecture et du patrimoine A fragmentary label on the reverse, dated April 1919, bears the name of Léonce Rosenberg and the Galerie de l'Effort Moderne, which Rosenberg founded in 1918. A collector of contemporary French art, Rosenberg had signed a contract with Metzinger in 1916. In exchange for a regular income, the dealer was granted the exclusive rights to Metzinger's artistic production. Metzinger had a solo exhibit at Rosenberg's gallery January 1919. Jean Metzinger's show was followed by exhibitions by Fernand Léger (February), Georges Braque (March), Juan Gris (April), Gino Severini (May), Pablo Picasso (June), Henri Hayden (December 1919), Jacques Lipchitz (January – February 1920), along with several group shows in which Metzinger participated, such as Les Maitres du Cubisme 3 May – 30 October 1920; an exhibit by the same name May 1921; Du cubisme à une renaissance plastique, 1922, and another solo exhibition 16 April – 10 May 1928. The painting was reproduced in the June 1924 (n. 6) issue of Bulletin de l'Effort Moderne. In 1955, Fruit and a Jug on a Table appeared in a public auction, in Paris, sold by an unknown dealer to Marlborough Fine Art, Ltd., London. In 1957, the painting was sold by Marlborough Fine Art to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, for £1,200 (accession date: January 10, 1957). This information comes from a letter from Marlborough Fine Art to W. G. Constable of the MFA (January 22, 1957), in the MFA curatorial file.

She is best known as the founder and first executive producer of Studio D of the National Film Board of Canada, the first government-funded film studio in the world dedicated to women filmmakers.  Career  = Early career = Shannon began her career in the Canadian film industry cataloging music for Crawley Films in Ottawa after dropping out of high school at the age of 16. She later joined the National Film Board (NFB) as an editor in 1956 when she was 21. In her early years at the NFB Shannon worked as a sound, music, and picture editor. After Shannon had some 200 films to her credit as an editor she directed her first film, Goldwood in 1970. Goldwood was based on her childhood memories of one of the mining towns in Northern British Columbia where her father, a mining engineer, had worked. From 1974 to 1975, Shannon produced and directed eleven short films that made up the Working Mother's film series. The films delve into the experiences of working mother's throughout Canada, with some of the films focused on an individual women, including Our Dear Sisters, whose subject was Indigenous filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin. The series was created as part of the NFB's Challenge for Change Program (1967-1980), which was a government funded initiative to bring the art and practice of film making to communities across Canada in an effort to incite social change. Initially meant to be one film, Shannon and distributive consultant Doris Mae Oulton proposed a format change of several short films and held small test screenings across different communities to try convince the NFB and the projects federal government sponsor of the new format's potential for success. With the new format approved, the Working Mother's series became arguably one of the most important achievements of Challenge for Change, and its success paved the way for Shannon's proposal for a women's studio within the NFB. = Studio D = Shannon was the driving force behind the creation of Studio D. She lobbied the unenthusiastic NFB to create a women's film production unit that would produce feminist documentaries created by and for women. When the studio was launched in 1974, it was housed in the basement of the NFB headquarters in Montreal with a budget of $100,000 and three women on staff; Shannon, Margaret Pettigrew, and Yuki Yoshida. Shannon became the first executive producer and remained in the role for 12 years before stepping down in June 1986. In an interview with The Christian Science Monitor, Shannon outlined in what her opinion was the five objectives of Studio D: \\"providing employment opportunities for women, providing training opportunities for women, meeting the information needs of women, creating an environment that would facilitate 'exploring our creativity in our own way', [and] bringing the perspective of women to bear 'on all social issues.'\\" While executive producer, Shannon oversaw the creation and production of over 80 films, including Not a Love Story: A Film About Pornography (1981), and the Academy Award-winning documentaries I'll Find a Way (1977) and If You Love This Planet (1982). = Legacy = In 1996 Studio D was closed due to decreased government funding and NFB layoffs. One of the last films produced by Studio D before it was shut down was a biographical documentary about Shannon entitled Kathleen Shannon: On Film, Feminism, and Other Dreams, directed by Gerry Rogers. The film includes personal interviews with Shannon as well as archival footage and photography. In the film Shannon reflects on various topics: from childhood, aging, and alcoholism, to the work-life balance, and her experiences during her time at the NFB and Studio D. The NFB also established a documentary prize in Shannon's name, the \\"Kathleen Shannon Award\\" which is awarded annually at the Yorkton Short Film and Video Festival.  Personal life  Shannon was married twice and had one son. After Shannon retired, she moved to the Kootenays where she opened a guest house for women and worked as a therapist. In 1986, Shannon was awarded the Order of Canada because, \\"Under her leadership, the National Film Board's Studio D - which she founded in 1974 - succeeded in producing award-winning socially and culturally committed films which have made Canada and the studio internationally known for the excellence and relevance of its work.\\" Shannon was also bestowed three honorary degrees: a Doctor of Laws from Queen's University in 1984, a Doctor of Letters from York University in 1996, and a Doctor of Humane Letters from Mount Saint Vincent University in 1997. Shannon died on January 9, 1998 at the age of 62. She had been diagnosed with lung cancer two weeks prior, and died during surgery to remove a tumor in Kelowna, British Columbia.

It is the second of his novels (after No Name) in which social questions provide the main impetus of the plot. Collins increasingly used his novels to explore social abuses, which according to critics tends to detract from their qualities as fiction. The social issue which drives the plot is the state of Scots marriage law; at the time the novel was written, any couple who were legally entitled to marry and who asserted that they were married, either before witnesses or in writing, were regarded in Scotland as being legally married. Plot summary The novel has a complex plot, which is common in Collins's work. In the Prologue, a selfish and ambitious man casts off his wife in order to marry a wealthier and better-connected woman by taking advantage of a loophole in the marriage laws of Ireland. The initial action takes place in the widowed Lady Lundie's house in Scotland. Geoffrey Delamayn has promised marriage to his lover Anne Silvester (governess to Lady Lundie's stepdaughter Blanche), who has incurred the enmity of her employer. The spendthrift Geoffrey is about to be disinherited and wishes to escape from his promise and marry a wealthy wife. Nevertheless, he is obliged to arrange a rendezvous with Anne, in the character of his wife, at an inn, and documents this in an exchange of notes with her. Subsequently, urgent matters force him to send his friend Arnold Brinkworth, Blanche's fiancé, to Anne in his place. To gain access to her, Arnold must ask for \\"his wife\\". Although nothing improper passes between them, they appear to the landlady and to Bishopriggs, a waiter, to be man and wife. Thus, both Geoffrey and Arnold might be deemed to be married to Anne, depending on the weight put on the spoken and written evidence. Most of the novel concerns Anne's, Geoffrey's and Arnold's attempts to clarify their marital status: *Anne needs to be married to save her reputation *Geoffrey wishes to cast off Anne by asserting that she is married to Arnold *Arnold wishes to marry Blanche but fears he has accidentally already married Anne under Scots law. In subsequent chapters Geoffrey, a keen athlete, courts Mrs Glenarm, a wealthy young widow, while Anne consults lawyers who give her conflicting advice about her position, and later tries to explain the situation to Mrs Glenarm, who rebuffs her. Arnold seeks the advice of Lady Lundie’s brother-in-law Sir Patrick Lundie, a retired lawyer. Sir Patrick approaches the problem with energy, but owing to various mishaps, Geoffrey’s determination that his scheme shall succeed, and the unsatisfactory state of the law, is not immediately successful. However, he ascertains that the correspondence linking Geoffrey and Anne exists and was stolen at the inn by Bishopriggs, who tries to extort money for it. Anne, who strongly wishes to remove any impediment to Blanche and Arnold’s marriage, comes to the same conclusion and forces Bishopriggs to give her the letter by threatening to reveal its contents, which would make it worthless for blackmail. Eventually Anne offers to reveal her relations with Geoffrey, even at the cost of her reputation – impressing Sir Patrick with her courageous and honourable behaviour. At a meeting of all the parties and their lawyers, she makes her revelations. Geoffrey can no longer avoid honouring his promise to her and acknowledges her as his wife. A sub-plot concerns Geoffrey’s athleticism. While training for an important race, Geoffrey is discovered to have a serious physical ailment rendering him liable to a paralytic stroke. In the race itself, in which Geoffrey represents the South of England against the North, he collapses near the end, leaving his opponent the victor. His “friends” desert him, having lost their bets placed on him. The novel finally becomes a thriller. Geoffrey takes Anne to a secluded cottage in which the cook- housekeeper Hester Dethridge (who also features in the earliest scenes) is mute. Hester inadvertently reveals to Geoffrey that she murdered her brutal and rapacious husband by dismantling part of the wall of his (locked) bedroom in an almost-invisible way, leaning through and smothering him. Geoffrey forces Hester to show him how to do the same to Anne. By various stratagems he gets Anne to sleep in a suitably-placed bed. However he suffers a stroke when about to smother her, and while unconscious is throttled by Hester, who belatedly recognises the enormity of what she has been abetting. Sir Patrick, knowing the danger in which Anne is placed, has kept watch outside the house and, when Anne gives the alarm, duly rescues her. In the final scene, Lady Lundie awaits a visit from Sir Patrick and his new bride. She is chagrined to discover that the lady in question, who takes precedence over her in the family, is her enemy Anne. Themes and Influences The theme of the Prologue is repeated in the main action, Anne and Blanche being the daughters of the abandoned women and her dearest friend. Apart from the marriage laws of Scotland, discussed above, Collins attacks the legal disadvantages of married women – also a mainspring of the plot of The Woman in White – and the cult of athleticism. In the novel he describes the practice of competitive athletics as dangerous to the athlete's health, and as productive of anti- intellectualism and brutality. Page points out that the last of these is not cognate with the other two, both of which were widely recognised as scandalous and were soon rectified by changes to the law, whereas athleticism and athletes appear to have been a pet hate of the diminutive and un-athletic Collins. However he argues that an obsession with physical, rather than intellectual or moral, culture is emblematic of the brutality and coarseness present in the social attitudes of the period. Page also notes the sexual element, explicit for the time, in the relationship of Geoffrey and Mrs Glenarm. Like No Name, the novel is structured in scenes, reflecting Collins's enduring interest in the theatrical. Peters states that it was “one of [his novels] originally conceived as a play”. Page notes that the action would have been too controversial to have been presented on the Victorian stage. Collins put effort into ensuring the accuracy of the novel's action in terms of the law of the time. Law was a subject of abiding interest to him, and legal questions and lawyers appear often in his works, notably in The Woman in White, Armadale, No Name and The Moonstone. Publication Man and Wife was first published in 1870 as a serial in Cassell's Magazine (London) and Harper's Weekly (New York). It was published in book form by F. S. Ellis the same year. Critical reception The novel, the next in sequence after Collins's highly successful The Moonstone, was a commercial success. Among modern critics, Peters holds a low opinion of its plot and characterisation, but Page argues that it should be classed with Collins's acclaimed 1860s fiction rather than with his later, and inferior, polemical novels. The novel has proved enduringly popular and remains in print.

Club career Born in Turin, Piedmont, Giuseppe followed the footsteps of his elder brother Sebastian to start his career at Juventus, one of the two largest teams in Piedmont, as well the Italian team with the most Serie A titles. Giuseppe was a player of the under-20 reserve team from 2008 until 2010, where he won the 2010 Torneo di Viareggio with the \\"bianconeri\\" playing as an attacking midfielder; Giuseppe was a member of the under-18 team in the 2007–08 season, for the Berretti reserve League. In the summer of 2010, Giuseppe left for Italian fourth division club Carrarese in a co-ownership deal, where he won the promotion playoffs. In June 2011 the deal was renewed; Carrarese also signed another attacking midfielder Luca Belcastro from Juventus during the same transfer window. Giuseppe made 16 starts and 9 substitute appearances as forward for Carrarese in the 2011–12 Lega Pro Prima Divisione. In June 2012, Juventus gave up the player's entire rights to Cararese. That window Carrarese also borrowed more players from Turin, such as forward Francesco Margiotta. On 31 August 2012 Juventus also transferred the co-ownership of Belcastro to Carrarese; on the same day Giuseppe left for fellow third division club Viareggio. Before he left the club, Giuseppe played twice for Carrarese in the 2012–13 Coppa Italia, scoring once in the first match, and starting as a winger. Belcastro, Giovinco and Margiotta were the substitutes in the second match. Giuseppe was Viareggio's joint-top-scorer in the league with 7 goals, along with Simone Magnaghi. Among the whole Group B of the third division, they were joint-16th, along with other players such as Belcastro. Giuseppe also played 4 times (4 goals and two bookings) in the 2012–13 Coppa Italia Lega Pro, in which the team finished as runners-up. He missed the return leg of the cup final due to suspension for his second booking of the tournament in the first leg. The team drew 1–1 with Latina and was defeated on aggregate. On 5 July 2013 Giuseppe was signed by Serie B newcomers Spezia on a free transfer; he was initially a member of the team during the club's pre-season camp, however, one month later, he joined third division club Pisa in a definitive 2-year contract deal. In January 2015, Giovinco was acquired by Lega Pro side Savona, signing a 2½ year contract with the club. On 16 October he was released. In January 2016 he was signed by Tuttocuoio; the following summer he moved to Catanzaro. On 8 September 2019, he signed with Ravenna. On 29 August 2020 he joined Renate. Style of play Giovinco is a quick, agile, and diminutive creative forward, with good technique, who is also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder. Personal life Although Giovinco was born in Torino, his father Giovanni is originally from Bisacquino in the Province of Palermo, Sicily, while his mother Elvira is from Catanzaro in Calabria. His older brother Sebastian is also a footballer who currently plays for Saudi Professional League club Al-Hilal FC, also as a forward; the two brothers grew up together playing in the Juventus Youth Academy.

It is in the Côte-d'Or department, within France's Bourgogne-Franche- Comté region. Gare de Dijon-Porte-Neuve is the secondary station for the city of Dijon, with the primary station being Gare de Dijon-Ville. TER (Transport express régional) trains take six minutes to go from one station to the other, crossing the city. Gare de Dijon-Porte-Neuve is an SNCF (Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français) train station, served by Burgundy TER trains and open for cargo transport. Location Gare de Dijon-Porte-Neuve is located at kilometre post 321.935 on the \\"Dijon-Ville – Is-sur-Tille Line\\". This situates it between the Dijon-Ville and the Ruffey-lès-Echirey stations. Gare de Dijon- Porte-Neuve is at an altitude of , whereas the altitude of Dijon's main train station, Dijon-ville, is . The Gare de Dijon-Porte-Neuve passenger station is located next to its freight station, which extends north toward the Toison d'Or neighborhood of Dijon. History Gare de Dijon-Porte-Neuve, next to the Departmental Railways of the Côte-d'Or Station (circa 1908) The French railway company Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM) was awarded a concession in 1863 to build a rail line from Dijon to Langres, and from there to France's border with Belgium. The large existing PLM train station was judged as not suitable for the new line and a site to the east of the city was chosen instead. Gare de Dijon-Porte-Neuve opened in 1870, after the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War. The new station was located adjacent to the existing station of the Departmental Railways of the Côte-d'Or, a secondary (not part of France's national railway network) narrow gauge railway servicing the following lines: Meuilley — Dijon, Dijon — Champlitte, and Dijon — Chatillon-sur-Seine. The last of these secondary lines would eventually close in 1948. For the LGV Rhin-Rhône Project, which had its first branch open on 11 December 2011, the Dijon government will expand and modernize Gare de Dijon-Porte-Neuve. In a related development, the train and bus station in the town center underwent a reorganization in 2008. Passenger and freight service Gare de Dijon-Porte-Neuve is an SNCF railway station building without a ticket window. It is equipped with a TER automated ticketing system and also has nearby parking for bicycles and other vehicles. The train platforms are situated on a concrete walkway, with stairways providing access. The station is served by TER Bourgogne trains on the line from the Dijon-Ville station to Is-sur-Tille. A train on the Intercités Dijon — Reims line and some trains to Culmont-Chalindrey and Troyes also service the station. The station is also open for freight. TGV project Due to the decision to increase the western branch of the LGV Rhin-Rhône to pass through Dijon, and the need for a new TGV station on this line, the current Gare de Dijon-Porte-Neuve will become Dijon's new TGV station, with an expected re-opening in 2025. Improvements to Dijon-Porte-Neuve have already included the creation of a tram station and a link to Gare de Dijon-Ville, using the Dijon Tramway, which began operation in September 2012.

It was a powerful tropical cyclone which struck the Philippines and southern China. Developing into a tropical storm on August 9, Utor soon underwent explosive intensification and became a typhoon within a half of day. After making landfall over Luzon late on August 11, the typhoon re-emerged in the South China Sea, and it ultimately made its second landfall over Guangdong, China on August 14. Meteorological history Early on August 8, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that a tropical disturbance had developed north of Yap. During that day, the system moved westwards and consolidated within a favourable environment of weak vertical wind shear and strong outflow, which was enhanced by a TUTT Cell located to the northwest of the disturbance. As a result, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), JTWC and PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression 11W north of Palau, with the latter naming it Labuyo as it approached the Philippine Area of Responsibility. During the next day, JTWC and JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with the latter naming it as Utor (1311). Shortly thereafter, Utor began undergoing explosive intensification, achieving typhoon status early on August 10, as an eye developed. On August 11, under the influence of low vertical wind shear, very favourable poleward and westward outflow, and warm sea surface temperature, Utor began to intensify more and formed a clear eye. At 12:00 UTC, Typhoon Utor attained peak intensity by the ten-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 105 knots (195 km/h, 105 mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to . The system became exceptionally symmetrical, as the convective bands had further deepened and wrapped tighter around a pin-hole eye, prompting JTWC upgrading Utor to a super typhoon. Due to land interaction with Luzon, the pin-hole eye filled in quickly; as a result, JTWC downgraded Utor to a typhoon at 18:00 UTC. Tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north, Utor made landfall over northern Luzon around 19:00 UTC (03:00 PHT on August 12). Owing to peaks of western Luzon, Utor significantly weakened as the deep convection became disorganised. Early on August 12, Utor arrived at the South China Sea, where the environment southwest of an anticyclone was favourable with diffluence aloft, light vertical wind shear and excellent radial outflow. Although a ragged eye had formed later that day, the typhoon did not restrengthen further when tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge. On August 13, the eye of Utor had become well-defined on the visible satellite imagery, but the intensity and structure remained when the system was tracking northwestward. At 07:50 UTC (15:50 CST) on August 14, Utor made landfall over Yangxi County in Yangjiang, Guangdong, China as a minimal typhoon. At 12:00 UTC, JMA downgraded Utor to a severe tropical storm, shortly before JTWC issued a final warning to the rapidly weakening system due to land interaction. Later, Utor weakened into a tropical storm overland, and JMA downgraded the system into a tropical depression at noon on August 15. However, the remnants began tracking very slowly in Guangxi, until the tropical depression finally dissipated on August 18. Preparations and impact =Philippines= Animated enhanced infrared satellite loop of Typhoon Utor from peak intensity to landfall in the Philippines Ahead of Utor affecting the Philippines, PAGASA issued various tropical cyclone signals for Luzon and Visayas, including signal 3 for the provinces of Aurora and Isabela and signal 1 for Metro Manila. As Utor approached Central Luzon, a Malacanang Palace spokesperson called that local government to prepare and evacuate residents living near slopes, mountains and sea. Thirty-two provinces in Luzon and Manila had been placed under signal warnings. In Isabela, 67 families were evacuated before landfall. Under the anticipation of a direct hit, the local Pangasinan government placed the entire province on red alert. On August 11, the governor announced the suspension of classes from pre-school to tertiary level. Government and private offices were also suspended. Rescue equipment and rubber boats had also been placed in the disaster risk area of the province. In the said regions, the government advised all to not engage in water sports or rough seas due to the anticipated rough seas. Utor made its landfall in Casiguran, Aurora at 3 AM (local time) on August 12. Power lines and telecommunications went down and many houses were destroyed. In Nueva Vizcaya, heavy rainfall had been recorded. Some residents in the said province were forced to evacuate due to flooding. Moreover, the Magat River in the province reached the critical level, resulting in the partial opening of four gates in a dam. Electricity was also out in the province. One man died in Baguio City after he had been buried alive after a mudslide hit his home. In Isabela, more than 100 families had been affected by Utor. About 200 million pesos in agriculture was blamed on Utor in Isabela alone. Around 1,000 residents in the central Bicol region spent the night in shelters, and 23 fishermen who were out at sea failed to return home in four towns in Catanduanes province. Some cars in North Luzon Expressway used hazard signals as roads were nearly impossible to see. Intense rainfall throughout the day had been recorded in Zambales, which created flash flooding in low-lying areas. The major river in the province then overflowed, flooding homes. The flooding was expected to rise as high tide was expected in the morning. At least 700 passengers were stranded in the ports of Albay, Catanduanes, Sorsogon and Samar. Additionally, 10 flights had also been canceled as Utor brought intense rainfall in many parts of Luzon. Throughout the Philippines, 11 people were killed while four others were listed as missing. A total of 407,493 people were affected by the typhoon, roughly a third of whom were displaced from their homes. Significant infrastructural damage took place with 2,592 homes destroyed and 21,197 more damaged. Losses from Utor amounted to ₱1.58 billion (US$36.4 million), the majority resulting from agricultural damage. =China= Typhoon Utor over Hong Kong on 14 August The Chinese bulk carrier Trans Summer sank some southwest of Hong Kong after having been caught in the typhoon. Twenty-one members of the crew were saved.Bulk carrier Trans Summer sank off Hong Kong in Typhoon Utor . Maritime Bulletin, 14 August 2013. Widespread damage took place in Guangdong Province where at least four people were killed and four others were listed missing. An estimated 1.09 million people were affected, 161,500 of whom were temporarily relocated due to the threat of flooding. Typhoon-force winds caused a belt factory in Dongguan to collapse, killing 1 person and injuring 17 others. Losses across the province amounted to ¥8.63 billion (US$1.41 billion). 18 people were killed in Guangxi Province while more than 1.3 million people were affected. Losses in the province reached ¥698 million (US$114 million). Prolonged heavy rains in Hunan Province triggered widespread flooding that caused substantial damage. At least five people were killed and five others were listed missing while 964,600 people were affected by the storm. Following the storm, prices of vegetables were raised by an average of one percent in Guangzhou, while the price of leafy vegetables were raised by as much as 15 percent. A total of 86 people were killed in Mainland China, while total damages were amounted to be ¥21.5 billion (US$3.51 billion). Retirement During their 2014 annual session, the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee announced that the name Utor would be retired from the naming lists. The name Barijat was chosen to replace Utor, and was used for the first time in the 2018 season. PAGASA announced that the name Labuyo, would be retired from its naming lists after it had caused over in damages. PAGASA chose the name Lannie to replace Labuyo for the 2017 season.

It is the fifth direct-to-video feature-length animated film in the Disneytoon Studios' Tinker Bell film series and the Disney Fairies franchise, based on the character Tinker Bell from J. M. Barrie's Peter and Wendy. The film features the voices of Mae Whitman, reprising her role of Tinker Bell, Christina Hendricks as a dust-keeper fairy named Zarina, and Tom Hiddleston as a much younger James Hook. Plot Zarina (Christina Hendricks), a very smart and inquisitive pixie dust-keeper fairy, is amazed by the magic behind pixie dust and is determined to find out all that it is capable of. She secretly experiments with some blue pixie dust, creating various colors of pixie dust; however, when she creates the pink variant, things grow wildly out of control, causing an accident in Pixie Hollow. Her supervisor, Fairy Gary, prohibits her from being a dust-keeper or working with pixie dust in any capacity. In sorrow, Zarina takes her experiments and runs away from Pixie Hollow. One year later, Pixie Hollow is celebrating the Four Seasons Festival, with performances from fairies of all the seasons. During the show, Tinker Bell (Mae Whitman), Silvermist (Lucy Liu), Iridessa (Raven-Symoné), Rosetta (Megan Hilty), Fawn (Angela Bartys), and Vidia (Pamela Adlon) spot Zarina flying around the audience and using pink pixie dust to summon several poppies that cause everyone to fall asleep, except Tink and her friends who take cover. After Zarina is gone, they realize that she stole all of the blue pixie dust, the only way to make the yellow dust that the fairies use to fly, so they go after her to get it back. They follow Zarina to the coast, where it is revealed that she became the captain of a pirate crew, including a young James Hook (Tom Hiddleston), who is apparently the cabin boy. The fairies manage to retrieve the blue dust for a moment, but Zarina gets it back after throwing some multi-colored pixie dust at them that switches their talents. Tinker Bell becomes a water fairy, Silvermist a fast-flying fairy, Fawn a light fairy, Iridessa a garden fairy, Rosetta an animal fairy, and Vidia a tinker fairy (much to her horror and disgust). They struggle with their swapped talents as they search for Zarina and the pirate ship, in the process meeting a baby crocodile which takes a liking to Rosetta with her new animal talent. They find the ship and sneak in, where they overhear Hook talking about how the pirates met Zarina after drifting off course, and she became the captain with the promise of making the ship fly so that they could plunder anything without getting caught. The ship arrives at Skull Rock, where the fairies discover the pirates' camp and a mysterious Pixie Dust Tree, which Zarina has grown using the pink pixie dust. The fairies attempt to retrieve the blue pixie dust, but are caught when Iridessa loses control over her nature talent and reveals their location. Tink tries to convince Zarina to return home to Pixie Hollow, but she refuses as no one appreciated her unusual talents with dust. With the fairies now captured, the pirates begin making regular flying pixie dust. Hook, curious about what it's like to fly, convinces Zarina to use some on him, and he begins to fly. After joyfully flying around the cave, Hook double- crosses Zarina and traps her in a lantern, revealing he is the real captain of the pirate crew and that he has merely been using her to get the pixie dust for his own purposes. Tinker Bell and the others attempt to escape their imprisonment without any success until the baby crocodile Rosetta befriended arrives and frees them. The fairies attempt once more to retrieve the blue pixie dust and almost succeed, before being confronted by Hook, who threatens to throw Zarina into the sea unless they hand the blue pixie dust over. Tink willingly gives it up, and Hook sprinkles it over the ship before throwing Zarina into the water anyway, leaving the fairies to rescue her. As the pirates sail towards the Second Star to start their thieving, the fairies return and use their switched talents to defeat the pirates and turn the ship. Zarina attempts to retrieve the blue pixie dust from Hook, who chases after her. Zarina manages to gain a speck of blue pixie dust which she then throws at Hook, who starts flying crazily as the two kinds of pixie dust react to each other. As the fairies fly away, Hook swears revenge on them and is attacked by the baby crocodile. Zarina returns the blue pixie dust to Tink and her friends, before preparing to leave. However, Tinker Bell offers her a chance to return to Pixie Hollow and she accepts, helping her friends sail the ship back to Pixie Hollow, where the other fairies are waking up with no recollection of what happened. Zarina is about to promise not to tamper with pixie dust again, but is instead convinced by Tink to show off her astoundingly profound pixie dust abilities, giving Tink and her friends back their original fairy talents and allowing them to put on a beautiful performance for the audience at the Festival. Everyone rushes over to congratulate them, particularly Zarina, whose unusually strong and rare talent of pixie dust alchemy is finally accepted so that she can be who she really is. In an extra scene during the end credits of the film, a drifting Captain Hook comes across a ship named The Jolly Roger. One of the crew members, Mr. Smee, rescues him.

In the early 1970s, on the advice of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Lama Shenpen went to India where she lived as a nun for six years, ordained by the 16th Karmapa. There she studied and meditated in retreat under the guidance of Tibetan teachers such as Karma Thinley Rinpoche,http://www.karmathinleyrinpoche.com/ Bokar Rinpoche and Kalu Rinpoche. Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa and head of the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, subsequently instructed her to return to the West to teach Mahamudra. She met her main teacher, Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, in Europe, and he encouraged her to teach and transmit Mahamudra, the innermost teachings of the Kagyu tradition.

Early life Sandberg grew up in Partille and played both football, with the local club Björndammens BK, and handball during his youth. His father Dennis Sandberg is a professional handball coach. In 2009, at age 15, he was invited to train with Hammarby IF in Allsvenskan, the Swedish top tier, but was not offered a contract. Instead, he signed with BK Häcken the same year and joined their youth academy. Club career Sandberg playing for BK Häcken in 2014 =BK Häcken= Sandberg signed his first professional contract with BK Häcken in 2012, and made his competitive debut in Allsvenskan on 23 May 2013 in a 3–0 win against Syrianska FC. He soon established himself as a starter at Häcken, playing both as a central defender and full back. Sandberg would move on to make a total of 60 league appearances for Häcken, scoring once, between 2013 and 2016. Most notably, Sandberg scored the decisive penalty when Häcken won the 2015–16 Svenska Cupen, the club's first ever domestic title, beating Malmö FF in the final after a 2–2 draw (5–6 on penalties). =Levski Sofia= On 9 July 2016, Sandberg was sold to Levski Sofia in the Bulgarian First League, signing a three year-deal. A transfer fee of around 2 million Swedish kronor (approximately £0,12 million) was suggested, as he only had six months left on his contract with the Swedish club. Sandberg saw his playing time limited at Levski Sofia, with his stint at the club being plagued by several serious injuries. He also fell out of favour with manager Elin Topuzakov soon after his arrival. Sandberg left the club in November 2017 by mutual consent, after only making 5 league appearances for Levski Sofia. =Hammarby IF= Ahead of the 2018 Allsvenskan, Sandberg returned to his native country, signing a two year-contract with Hammarby IF. He made his debut for the club in a 3–1 home win against IK Sirius on 1 April. During the season, Sandberg played 23 league games for Hammarby as the club finished 4th in the table.

In the , Conara had a population of 424. History =Foundation= The founding of Conara originated in the early 1800s, from a land grant given to settlers James and Catherine Smith. At this time, the settlement was known as \\"Willis’ Corner\\", or by the more contemporary and colloquially known \\"Humphrey’s Waterhole\\", until Smith was asked to establish an inn in 1850 to provide overnight hospitality to travellers on coach routes between Hobart and Launceston. \\"The Corners Inn\\", built in 1850, gave its name to the future township, where it became known as \\"The Corners\\". This name would be recognised in part by the inn, but also that Conara was an important junction for the coach and rail networks in Tasmania. The inn itself became known to travellers as \\"The Disappearing House\\", due to the way of which the inn disappeared in front of a hill when viewed heading south. The town's post office, known as \\"Corners PO\\", opened on 12 August 1862, and was renamed to Conara Junction on 14 October 1887. The original name of \\"The Corners\\" remained with the adjoining land until 1958 when then owner, Graeme Taylor, sold his 400 acres (less the separate title for the old Inn), to Alan McKinnon who absorbed it into his property Glen Esk on the banks of the South Esk River near Epping Forest. When the railways arrived in Conara in the 1880s, the township became an important social hub in the Midlands region of Tasmania. The boom affected the township greatly, with housing, employment, a church opening in 1892, as well as a part-time school opening in 1891. In 1903, the local school began full-time operation until it closed in 1974 due to low enrolment. The church is now disused and derelict, and the general store and shops have closed. The town's post office was renamed from Conara Junction to Conara on 1 January 1960, but the post office has since closed. Today, with the heyday all but over, Conara still remains an important siding for trains, albeit diminished; as well as a destination between the two main cities. The town has, and still remains one of the most unsafe level crossings in Tasmania, with the railway intersecting the Midland Highway. =Conara Junction= In 1872, the Tasmanian Main Line Railway Company surveyed and constructed their government-sponsored main railway line between Hobart and Launceston, which helped to expand the town. Due to mining interests on the East Coast of Tasmania, in 1886 the railway company constructed the Fingal line, branching eastwards out of the town, through Avoca and Fingal to the Cornwall and Mt. Nicholas coal mines near St Marys. The township of Conara derives its name from the Aboriginal word for \\"coal\\", although the relevance of this name may be questioned as no coal bearing seams exist in its vicinity. Seeing daily services from Hobart or Launceston, as well as freight workings on the Fingal line on the new Tasmanian Government Railways, Conara Junction developed into a railway town; becoming home to mostly railway employees, as well as recreation and housing provided by the Railways Institute. With the removal of passenger services on the Fingal Line in the 1950s, and the subsequent investment in the highway system in Tasmania; the railways and their importance in Tasmania dwindled, and as a result Conara was affected. Railway workers, who made up most of the town's population, lost work and moved elsewhere, and with the transfer of the Tasmanian Government Railways to the Australian National Railways Commission in 1978, passenger operations ceased on the network and Conara lost most of its rail traffic. Road infrastructure National Highway 1 passes through from south-west to west, and the A4 road (Esk Highway) branches off to the east. This intersection is at the tripoint of road route zones 3, 4 and 5.

Neha Pandey was in charge of casting It aired on Zee TV from Monday to Friday 7pm in the evening. The show was dubbed in English and aired on Zee World, DSTV and dubbed in Tamil as En Kanmani (My Lovely) on Polimer TV. It is currently still available in the original Hindi version for the audience on ZEE5. Plot summary Ek Mutthi Aasmaan follows the story of Kalpana \\"Kalpi\\" Jadhav (Rachana Parulkar) and Raghav Singhania (Ashish Chaudhary), as their paths cross on a journey of self improvement. Kalpi is the daughter of a maid, Kamla Jadhav (Shilpa Shirodkar), and a mill worker, Vitthal Jadhav (Mohit Dagga). Her mother's dream is to become a part of the middle class so she works tirelessly. Kalpana selflessly loves her mother, but is deprived of her love and attention because Kamla is always busy looking after family members of her employers, mostly Pakhi Kapoor (Shirina Singh). Raghav Singhania is a rich businessman whose mission is to take revenge from the Kapoors who murdered his father. Raghav has always been in debt to Kamla as she helped him escape from the Kapoors who wanted to adopt him and take away all his wealth. He becomes attracted to Kalpi's sweet, simple and caring nature and falls in love with her. Eventually, Kalpana recognizes Raghav's feelings and reciprocates. Raghav and Kalpana fall in love, and with the blessing of their parents, plan their wedding. On the day of his wedding to Kalpi, Raghav marries Pakhi Kapoor instead. Eventually, Raghav realizes his mistake but cannot rectify it because his mother, Gauri, wants him to use his marriage to Pakhi in her plans against the Kapoors. In order to prove his love for Kalpi, he marries her by putting the sindoor on her forehead in a temple. Paakhi hires goons to kidnap Kalpi and keep her in a remote location. Later, Raghav learns where Paakhi is hiding Kalpi and rescues her. A car chase ensues in which the car drives off a cliff and blows up. Some fishermen find Kalpi in the river and take her to a hospital; Raghav is still missing. While in the hospital, Dhiraj Diwan is depressed over his niece Suhana's (Asha Negi) death. When he hears how Kalpi's face has been burned and that she has lost her memory, he requests the doctor to perform a plastic surgery procedure to make Kalpi look like Suhana. The surgery is successful. Suhana has flashbacks of her real family, the accident and struggles to believe she is indeed Suhana Diwan. On the day Suhana is to marry Aryan (Kunal Varma), she realizes that she is Kalpi and she marries Raghav instead.

Its exact origins are disputed. At least one historian has claimed that it existed as early as 1917. It has been described as a paramilitary, quasi-official, vigilante, anti- communist organisation. The group was primarily concerned with the social conditions arising from the Great Depression, and the actions of the Labor state government in New South Wales led by Premier Jack Lang.Keith Amos. Campbell, Eric (1893–1970). Australian Dictionary of Biography. National Centre of Biography, Australian National University. Retrieved 10 August 2013. Neither the Old Guard, nor its offshoot, the New Guard, supported the Australia First Movement. In response to rumours that fires would be started by agitators, the Old Guard was a driving force behind the more effective organisation of country bush fire brigades in New South Wales. As fears of a communist takeover subsided, the Old Guard lacked purpose and was dissolved sometime in the 1950s. Secrecy The group was sworn to absolute secrecy regarding membership, and was divided into cells so that its leadership would be hard to identify. Media reports on the group in the 1930s were scarce, and information about it has been obscured by the destruction of its own records. Split The New Guard split from the group in 1931. Eric Campbell wanted a more visible organisation than the secretive Old Guard. The New Guard was less of a military force than the Old Guard, which opposed the split because it was fearful of communists exploiting the division. Both groups had devised plans to neutralise each other should it be needed. Members At the height of its popularity, the Old Guard in Australia had a membership of around 30,000. Members were loyalists and idealists devoted to the British Empire and ready to act pre-emptively to prevent a socialist revolution in Australia. Old Guard leaders were wealthy Protestant Anglo-Australians. Membership in rural New South Wales, and ties to the New South Wales police force, were strong. At the federal level the Old Guard had its closest ties to the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Defence. Like many former officers of the Australian Army George Wootten joined the Old Guard.A. J. Hill. Wootten, Sir George Frederick (1893–1970). Australian Dictionary of Biography.

Medabots is one of only three games in the series to be released outside Japan, the other two being Medabots AX and Medabots Infinity. Plot Ikki Tenryou is a young boy who's obsessed with Medabots, just like every other kid, however he doesn't have one yet. One day, his mother asks him to buy some dinner, but instead he gets talked into buying a Medabot instead with the money. However it turns out it's missing a medal, a vital part to make a Medabot work. However, a strange mysterious man called the Phantom Renegade gives a medal to Ikki's father and tells him he should give it to his son. Now Ikki will finally be able to also take part in Robattles and compete with other fellow Medafighters. But whoever loses the battle must submit one of their Medabot's Medaparts to the victor. Gameplay Gameplay is split into two different sections. One for the World Map, and another for Battles. When travelling around the World Map you can find random encounters with other Medafighters. When encountering another Medafighter; it is set in a 3-v-3 Battle with a unique battle system, with each Medabot having four different actions (Head parts have a finite amount of ammo, the Medabot will cease to function once its head is destroyed. R.Arm and L.Arm parts have infinite amount of ammo and can be used repeatedly until destroyed. Legs can affect the movement of your Medabot based on the terrain within a battle and build up the Medaforce meter). The way to act in battle is different compared to other RPGs, targeting a certain Medabot part and Medabot is usually randomized but can be avoided by using certain Medaparts that aim at certain parts, and the speed of your Medabot is dependent on the Leg Medaparts it has and the terrain it is battling on. The battle is over when the \\"Leader\\" Medabot's head is destroyed. Some encounters such as the Rubberobo Gang for example; will give you Rubberobo Medals for you to use to escape from battles. You earn experience points, Medaparts and money by winning battles. You can customize your Medabot with Medaparts, which can be won from other medafighters or bought in shops.Natsume (2002), Medabots: Metabee EU Instruction Booklet Reception Marcel van Duyn of Nintendo Life gave it a retrospective rating of 6/10.http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu- eshop/medabots_metabee_and_rokusho_gba References Category:Natsume (company) games Category:Video games about robots Category:2002 video games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Video game remakes Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with alternate versions Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Medabots (video game)"},{"id":"40203233","text":"Victoria Bridge, Glasgow Looking over the bridge Victoria Bridge Silver Epergne gifted to builder William York, Esq. Hallmarked London, 1854 Victoria Bridge is a category A listed road bridge spanning the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland. Victoria Bridge is the oldest surviving bridge in Glasgow, lying at the foot of Stockwell Street in the city centre. History Victoria Bridge is built on the site of the first recorded bridge over the Clyde; a timber bridge believed to exist in 1285 and described as \\"Glaskow bryg, that byggt was of tre\\" in Henry the Minstrel's epic poem on Sir William Wallace. In 1345 Bishop William Rae replaced the timber bridge with the Bishop's Bridge, located on the same site. Bishop's Bridge was originally wide, but was widened by in 1777. By 1851 Glasgow's population had risen to 329,000 having doubled in the previous 25 years and the old bridge couldn't cope with current demands, and needed to be replaced. Construction A new masonry arch bridge was designed by James Walker and constructed by William Scott, although some references name William York, Esquire as the builder. The bridge has five segmental arches which vary in span from 20.4 meters to the widest in the center, which measures 24.4 m wide. The construction replaced Bishop's bridge, with foundations 6 meters below those of the old bridge, and timber piles which were steam-driven a further 4 meters below that. Named after Queen Victoria, when the bridge opened in 1854, Glasgow had one of the two widest bridges in Britain – London's widest at that time was only . The bridge carries the western arm of the A8 across the River Clyde. It is one way city- bound with 2 lanes. However, it also has a contraflow Bus, Cycle and Taxi lane. It is complemented by the Albert Bridge on the other side of the railway bridge, which is also two-way. On the northern shore, the A8 immediately crosses the A814, to take Bridgegate towards Glasgow Cross. Meanwhile, on the southern shore, the A8 takes Gorbals Street as far as Norfolk Street, which is the A8 in both directions, Gorbals Street becoming the A730.

He led a successful public life, and, in 1769, became Konferenzrat to the Danish royal household. Cossel and his second wife are buried in the forest adjacent to the park on the Jersbek estate.  Biography  = Birth, family, and education = Paschen von Cossel was born to Henning Detloff Kossel (2 March 1670 – 6 July 1741) and Catharina Dorothea Pritzbuer (26 February 1683 – 17 November 1741), the last of eight children. His father had been a merchant, vintner, cellarer, and innkeeper in Anklam, Wismar, Neubrandenburg, and Stralsund, since 1700. Cossel spent his school days in the Gymnasium Stralsund (part of the Katharinenkloster), where he received a thorough education (learning, for instance, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew), gaining his school certificate in 1731. He received his Licentium Juris at the University of Rostock (1731)See the university's records of the matriculation of Paschen Kossel the Ernst-Moritz- Arndt-Universität Greifswald (1734), and the Martin-Luther-Universität Halle- Wittenberg (1736), where he wrote a doctoral dissertation. = Two childless marriages = On the 15 May 1748 in Pyrmont, Paschen von Cossel married Christine Eleonore Seip (14 January 1728 – 23 July 1748), daughter of Dr Johann Philipp Seip, the royal physician. Following her untimely death shortly after the marriage, Cossel married Maria Elisabeth Matthießen (28 January 1718 – 5 April 1789) on the 12 August 1755. Neither marriage yielded any progeny. = Death = Over ninety years old, Paschen von Cossel died in his Jersbek residence around 1pm on the 17 January 1805. The burial took place on the 23 January in the early hours of the morning, in the presence of friends and family; he is buried next to his second wife in the park of the Jersbek estate. This burial was altogether unconventional: there were no tolling bells, the burial place was not a consecrated graveyard, and there was neither pastor, nor blessing. It is not known why Cossel made these burial wishes. There are three factors which may have contributed to this decision, all based in the zeitgeist of the latter half of the eighteenth century: a desire to look back to the customs of antiquity, whereby one would be buried extra muros, i.e. in open space; the Enlightenment idea that it was unhygienic to bury the dead in and around churches; and simply a love of nature. Another possible reason for this unusual burial is that Cossel had feuded with Pastor Hans Christian Andresen, of Sülfeld.  Charges, titles, and honours  Both of Cossel's brothers went to Hamburg to establish trade businesses. Paschen followed them there in 1738, but became a lawyer. Through his excellent legal knowledge, juristic acumen, practical skill, and oratorical talent, he quickly developed a large and notable chancellery. On the 3 July 1741, Elector Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, in his role as imperial vicar for Saxony, granted Cossel the privilege of a count palatinate.This may be a mistranslation from the German article. Cf. \\"Kurfürst Friedrich August II. von Sachsen in seiner Eigenschaft als Reichsvikar für die Lande Sächsischen Rechts erteilte Paschen Cossel auf dessen Antrag bereits am 3. Juli 1741 „durch ein förmliches Diploma“ das Privileg eines kaiserlichen Pfaltz- und Hof-Grafen (Comites Palatini), einer Art kaiserlichen Notars.\\" On the 16 April 1750, Cossel was elected successor to the Very Reverend Nicolai Albert von Holtze, of the syndic of the Hamburg Cathedral chapter. He held this office until 1760. Also, from the 15 December 1755 to the 9 April 1791, he was co-manager of the diocese (Canonicus minor). He became the Mecklenburg-Schweriner Wirklicher Justizrat (4 November 1752), the Etatsrat to the royal Russian and Holsteinian households (23 July 1760), and the Konferenzrat to the royal Danish household (8 November 1769). Paschen von Cossel's long-time friend, Christian Stilck, presented him with letters patent and a grant of arms, and was raised into the untitled ranks of nobility on 21 December 1742. After he visited the imperial court in Vienna and asked for a raise in noble rank, he was granted the hereditary style of \\"Ritter und Edler von Cossel\\" (The Knight and The Noble of Cossel) on the 2 June 1755.

Early career Rhomberg was working as a medical assistant when she met the German director Hans Billian and began a relationship with him. In 1975, she starred in the first full hardcore German porn movie, Bienenstich im Liebesnest (the soft version was titled Im Gasthaus zum scharfen Hirschen, also known as Zimmermädchen machen es gerne) directed by Billian, where she played Graziella Schill, a woman chasing the elderly husband who cheated. In this film, she did not perform hardcore action: the most explicit sexual act is a brief footjob. Josefine Mutzenbacher In 1976, Billian gave her the lead role, in part because she had the proper dialect for it, in the first part of the adult film Josefine Mutzenbacher – Wie sie wirklich war (known in English as Sensational Janine), in which she plays the Vienna prostitute Josefine Mutzenbacher. This film brought her to fame in Germany. Josefine's age is 14 years old in the novel, but no age is mentioned in the script of the film. Jim Holliday has described this film as \\"easily the best and most accurate of several films based on the life and adventures of legendary Viennese madam Josephine Mutzenbacher\\" and his \\"all time foreign favorite\\" adult film. Sensational Janine was \\"one of the most successful foreign x-rated films ever to cross the Atlantic\\", and the movie is \\"today seen as one of the best porns of all time\\". Later career In 1977, she starred in Kasimir der Kuckuckskleber. Her role was Larissa Holm, a \\"fun loving\\" young woman who agrees with Kasimir Zwickelhuber (played by Sepp Gneißl) to go into prostitution in order to pay off some debts. Around this period as well, she starred in numerous hardcore loops directed by Billian, such as Venus in Seide and Schwarzer Orgasmus, which were among the first examples of interracial pornography on the German porn scene. In addition to her acting work, she also worked as a fluffer for other Billian films. In 1978, she broke with Billian and returned to her original profession.

The Nissen fundoplication, a surgical procedure for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, is named after him. Nissen completed the first pneumonectomy by a Western physician in 1931. In 1948, he performed an abdominal surgery that extended the life of Albert Einstein by several years. He trained under German physicians Ludwig Aschoff and Ferdinand Sauerbruch. Nissen wrote an autobiography published at Deutsche Verlags- Anstalt in 1969 called “Helle Blätter, dunkle Blätter. Erinnerungen eines Chirurgen.“ () which was reviewed in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. A selection of his writings and lectures was published at Schattauer in 1997 under the title of “Fünfzig Jahre erlebter Chirurgie: Ausgewählte Vorträge und Schriften.“ (). Biography Nissen was born in a Jewish-German family in Neisse, Silesia, German Empire, in 1896. He was the son of Franz Nissen, a well-known surgeon. Rudolph Nissen pursued medical studies in Munich, Marburg and Breslau. He then trained in pathology under influential physician Ludwig Aschoff at the University of Freiburg. During the First World War he served in a medical corps unit and was severely injured by a gunshot in his lung which led to lifelong problems with his lung. He finished his medical studies after the war. In 1921, he came to the University of Munich as an assistant to German surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch. Six years later, Sauerbruch and Nissen moved to the Charité at the University of Berlin. In 1933, Nissen became the surgery department head at Istanbul University. The move was prompted by Hitler's Jewish boycott, although Nissen was at first not directly affected by anti-Jewish legislation because he had been an active World War I front soldier. Nissen left Turkey for the United States in 1939. He was a surgery research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital for two years. He spent several years in New York as chair of the surgery programs at Jewish Hospital and Maimonides Medical Center. He was a department head at the University of Basel from 1952 to his retirement in 1967. He died in 1981 in Riehen. Surgical contributions =Nissen fundoplication= Nissen fundoplication While in Istanbul in 1936, Nissen excised an esophageal ulcer from a 28-year-old patient. The operation required Nissen to remove a portion of the lower esophagus and join the remaining esophagus to the stomach. In an effort to avoid the backflow of stomach contents into the patient's esophagus, Nissen wrapped (plicated) folds of the patient's upper stomach around the lower esophagus. Following the patient subsequently, Nissen noted that the patient's problems with heartburn improved after surgery. Through the 1940s and 1950s, Nissen treated many patients with hiatal hernias using conventional methods developed by other surgeons. He even performed one of these procedures, an anterior gastropexy, on eminent radiologist Gustav Bucky. Bucky was very ill when he presented to Nissen, but he completely recovered. Though Bucky remained asymptomatic for at least 15 years, many patients experienced relapses. By 1955, Nissen began to think back on the successful procedure in Istanbul. Now based in Basel, he operated on two patients with reflux esophagitis, wrapping a portion of the stomach around the lower esophagus. He published the results of the two cases in 1956. =Pneumonectomy= Abdominal aortic aneurysm By training under Sauerbruch, Nissen developed unique skill in surgery of the chest. Through his own mentoring by Polish-Austrian surgeon Jan Mikulicz-Radecki, Sauerbruch had learned to perform thoracic surgery by use of a pressure chamber before it was possible to give anesthesia to patients through breathing tubes. In 1931, Nissen treated a 12-year-old girl who had sustained a crush injury to the chest with chronic pus production from the left lung. Nissen elected to perform left pneumonectomy, or removal of the lung. The first surgery was halted when the patient experienced asystole (\\"flatline\\"). The patient was stabilized and the second phase of the pneumonectomy was completed two weeks later. The patient survived for several years. Nissen was the first Western physician to complete the procedure; successful pneumonectomy was reported in the United States in 1933. =Einstein's aneurysm repair= Albert Einstein in 1947 In December 1948, Nissen admitted Albert Einstein to Jewish Hospital for removal of intestinal cysts. However, the scientist was also suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An aneurysm is a dilatation that occurs in a blood vessel. In the portion of the aorta that runs through the abdomen, aneurysms are typically asymptomatic until rupture is imminent. AAA rupture can cause immediate death from exsanguination. Definitive surgical treatment for AAA had not been devised in the 1940s. Beginning in 1943, reinforcement with cellophane had been used to induce fibrosis in the vessel, decreasing the risk of rupture. Nissen wrapped the aneurysm with cellophane and Einstein recovered from the surgery. Upon his hospital discharge, Einstein was surrounded by photographers and he was photographed with his tongue sticking out at them. He sent an autographed newspaper clipping of the photo to Nissen with the inscription \\"To Nissen my tummy / The world my tongue.\\" Einstein lived for several years after Nissen wrapped his AAA in cellophane. Einstein died in a Princeton, New Jersey hospital in 1955. Initial news reports listed gallbladder inflammation as the cause of death. However, his medical team had suspected gallbladder irritation resulting from a leaking AAA. An autopsy conducted by pathologist Thomas Harvey showed that he died of a leaking AAA. By the time of Einstein's death, surgical AAA repair was technically possible but still very uncertain. The surgeon who saw Einstein in Princeton, Frank Glenn of New York Hospital, proposed surgery. Einstein was in his seventies and he elected to die peacefully rather than undergo surgery. \\"I want to go when I want,\\" Einstein told his physicians. He told his secretary Helen Dukas, \\"I can die without the help of the doctors.\\" He also told her that it was \\"tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share. It is time to go. I will do it elegantly.\\" Legacy The Rudolf Nissen Prize is awarded by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Allgemein- und Viszeralchirurgie (German Society of General and Visceral Surgery) to recognize surgeons who have advanced the field of gastroenterological surgery. In commemoration of his 100th birthday, a scientific publication of The International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus was dedicated to Nissen in 1996. In 2016, the Charité opened a new building for emergency admissions named after Nissen, the Rudolf-Nissen-Haus.

It features the biggest video library of expert advice for parents on the internet. The site contains over 8,000 videos from 450 experts, such as Daniel J. Siegel, Edward Hallowell, John Gray, and Arianna Huffington. History Kids in the House is a video library of parenting and parenting advice videos, which was launched in 2013. She has stated that she decided to start building the library in order to democratize the availability of parenting advice across the US. She has also stated that advice for non- traditional family types are an important part of the library. The archive is the largest compendium of parenting advice videos available online. The videos are produced by Kids in the House founder Leana Greene, who shot each of the eight thousand or so videos in her Los Angeles production studio. As of May 2014 the site housed videos featuring about 450 different parenting consultants, public personalities such as film or television actors/actresses, and regular parents. NBC News described the video collection, writing that, “From advice on picky eaters, to guidance on managing parental stress, and information on maternity leave, Kids in the House has parents covered from the first steps of family planning all the way to getting the kids off to college.” In 2013 Kids in the House produced a video with advice from Pattie Mallette, the mother of singer Justin Bieber, who provided advice on raising a child who becomes a successful entertainer at a young age. In 2014 the company produced a video with advice from dancer and model Brooke Burke-Charvet on shedding the weight gained during pregnancy. In 2015 Ali Landry appeared in a video on spending Valentine's Day together as a family. The site has also produced videos for children themselves, and in 2014 the organization launched an anti-bullying campaign, including awareness videos that mentioned bullying statistics and anecdotes.

In checking a logical inference for formal and material validity, the meaning of only its logical vocabulary and of both its logical and extra-logical vocabulary is considered, respectively. Examples For example, the inference \\"Socrates is a human, and each human must eventually die, therefore Socrates must eventually die\\" is a formally valid inference; it remains valid if the nonlogical vocabulary \\"Socrates\\", \\"is human\\", and \\"must eventually die\\" is arbitrarily, but consistently replaced.A completely fictitious, but formally valid inference obtained by consistent replacement is e.g. \\"Buckbeak is a unicorn, and each unicorn has gills, therefore Buckbeak has gills\\". In contrast, the inference \\"Montreal is north of New York, therefore New York is south of Montreal\\" is materially valid only; its validity relies on the extra-logical relations \\"is north of\\" and \\"is south of\\" being converse to each other.A completely fictitious, but materially (and formally) invalid inference obtained by consistent replacement is e.g. \\"Hagrid is younger than Albus, therefore Albus is larger than Hagrid\\". Consistent replacement doesn't respect conversity. Material inferences vs. enthymemes Classical formal logic considers the above \\"north/south\\" inference as an enthymeme, that is, as an incomplete inference; it can be made formally valid by supplementing the tacitly used conversity relationship explicitly: \\"Montreal is north of New York, and whenever a location x is north of a location y, then y is south of x; therefore New York is south of Montreal\\". In contrast, the notion of a material inference has been developed by Wilfrid Sellars in order to emphasize his view that such supplements are not necessary to obtain a correct argument. Brandom on material inference =Non-monotonic inference= Robert Brandom adopted Sellars' view,; Sect. 2.III-IV arguing that everyday (practical) reasoning is usually non-monotonic, i.e. additional premises can turn a practically valid inference into an invalid one, e.g. # \\"If I rub this match along the striking surface, then it will ignite.\\" (p→q) # \\"If p, but the match is inside a strong electromagnetic field, then it will not ignite.\\" (p∧r→¬q) # \\"If p and r, but the match is in a Faraday cage, then it will ignite.\\" (p∧r∧s→q) # \\"If p and r and s, but there is no oxygen in the room, then the match will not ignite.\\" (p∧r∧s∧t→¬q) # ... Therefore, practically valid inference is different from formally valid inference (which is monotonic - the above argument that Socrates must eventually die cannot be challenged by whatever additional information), and should better be modelled by materially valid inference. While a classical logician could add a ceteris paribus clause to 1. to make it usable in formally valid inferences: # \\"If I rub this match along the striking surface, then, ceteris paribus,literally: \\"all other things being equal\\"; here: \\"assuming a typical situation\\" it will inflame.\\" However, Brandom doubts that the meaning of such a clause can be made explicit, and prefers to consider it as a hint to non-monotony rather than a miracle drug to establish monotony. Moreover, the \\"match\\" example shows that a typical everyday inference can hardly be ever made formally complete. In a similar way, Lewis Carroll's dialogue \\"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\\" demonstrates that the attempt to make every inference fully complete can lead to an infinite regression.  See also Material inference should not be confused with the following concepts, which refer to formal, not material validity: * Material conditional -- the logical connective \\"→\\" (i.e. \\"formally implies\\") * Material implication (rule of inference) -- a rule for formally replacing \\"→\\" by \\"¬\\" (negation) and \\"∨\\" (disjunction) Notes Citations References * Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Sellars view Category:Non-classical logic Category:Inference ","title":"Material inference"},{"id":"40203401","title":"List of chat websites"},{"id":"40203402","text":"Nick Hengelman (born 15 November 1989) is a Dutch footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Dutch Eredivisie side AFC Ajax.

It is an unusually large church, and may have been used by Dominicans preaching for the Crusades. History The interior of the church The church of Lau dates from the early 13th century, but was possibly pre- dated by a Romanesque church on the same site. Just south of the church are also the remains of a defensive tower, dating from the 12th century and later converted into a rectory (since destroyed). Far earlier, the area around the present-day church seems to have been a place of importance as pre-Christian grave fields, several centuries older than the church, have been found both north and south of the church. The oldest part of the church is the unusually large nave, dating from the early 13th century and Romanesque in style. The likewise grand choir dates from around 1300, and possibly more specifically from before 1288 when a short civil war on the island may have disrupted building plans. The church is one of the largest (during the 13th century the largest) country churches on Gotland, situated in a relatively small parish. Scholars speculate as to why such a large church was built at the site. Some believe that the unusual size and grandeur of the church was an effect of the church being situated near the coast, close by a good natural harbour, and the parish may have benefited economically from foreign trade. Another theory is that it may have served as a church for pilgrims. Most probably however, the church may have drawn crowds as one of a few churches outside Visby where the island's Dominican friars used to preach for a crusade against Courland, Livonia and Prussia. It is known through several preserved papal letters that the popular Dominicans were explicitly asked to preach for crusades not only in Visby but also on certain places in the countryside, and scholars have concluded that Lau Church was probably one of these sites. No major alterations have been made to the church since the Middle Ages. A through renovation of the church was carried out in 1958-1960. Architecture As mentioned, the church is one of the largest medieval country churches on Gotland. It has five external portals, the most of any country church on the island. Especially the Romanesque portals of the nave are noteworthy, richly sculpted and unusually large. The church lacks a tower; it can be deducted from the way the west end of the church is built that plans to build one existed but for one reason or another it was never executed. The interior is dominated by the high vaulted ceiling, carried by large columns with sculpted bases and capitals. On the western wall are murals from 1520, depicting the Last Judgement. A few remains of the original stained glass windows remain. The church has some notable furnishings. The altarpiece, depicting the Coronation of the Virgin, is from the beginning of the 15th century but later (18th century) re-painted. The triumphal cross of the church is one of the largest in the Nordic countries, dating from the mid-13th century. The baptismal font is a work by the Romanesque sculptor Sigraf.

He was unraced as a two-year-old before winning four of his six races as a three-year-old in 1985 including the Cumberland Lodge Stakes and St. Simon Stakes. In the following year he was tried at the highest level, winning the Princess of Wales's Stakes and International Stakes and finishing second to Dancing Brave in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He was retired to stud at the end of 1986 but had little success as a sire of winners. Background Shardari was a bay horse with a faint white star and white socks on his hind legs bred in Ireland by his owner Aga Khan IV. His sire Top Ville was an Irish-bred, French-trained horse which won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1979. At stud he also sired Toulon, winner of the St Leger Stakes, Pistolet Bleu (Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud), Saint Estephe (Coronation Cup) and Darara (Prix Vermeille). His dam Sharmada finished second in the Prix d'Arenberg and was a great-granddaughter of Gourabe, whose other descendants included the Prix de Diane winner Dunette. The colt went into training with Michael Stoute at his Freemason Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1985: three-year-old season= Shardari was a late developing horse who did not race until the summer of his three-year-old season. He began his career by beating moderate opposition in the More Lane Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse and the Smeeth Stakes over the same distance at Folkestone. He was then moved up in class and distance for the Listed Alycidon Stakes over one and a half miles at Goodwood Racecourse in July. He started favourite, but finished second to his stable companion Shernazar, a four-year-old half-brother to Shergar. His next race was the Group Two Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse on 21 August when he was made 7/4 joint favourite with Damister, a colt who had won the Dante Stakes and finished third in The Derby. Shardari was assigned a weight of 119 pounds, four pounds less than his main rival. The two favourites dominated the finish, with Shardari overtaking Damister fifty yards from the finish to win by a neck. The racecourse stewards, however, relegated the winner to second place and issued a four-day riding ban to his jockey Walter Swinburn for bumping the runner-up in the closing stages. The decision was controversial, as Shardari appeared to have proved himself the better horse at the weights, but it was upheld following an appeal to the Jockey Club. The Great Voltigeur is often regarded as a trial for the St Leger Stakes, but Shardari had never been entered for the race. His next appearance was in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes in September at Ascot Racecourse, where his opponents included Phardante, who had finished second to the filly Oh So Sharp in the St Leger. Confidently ridden by Swinburn, Shardari took the lead in the straight and won easily by six lengths. On his final race of the year, Shardari started evens favourite for the St Simon Stakes at Newbury Racecourse. He took the lead three furlongs from the finish and drew clear of the field to win by fifteen lengths from Free Guest, a filly who had won the Nassau Stakes and two runnings of the Sun Chariot Stakes. =1986: four-year-old season= On his four-year-old debut, Shardari started the odds-on favourite for the Ormonde Stakes at Chester Racecourse in May. He took the lead three furlongs from the finish, but tired badly in the soft ground and was easily beaten by Brunico, a 33/1 outsider best known for his performances in hurdle races. He was again disappointing in the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June, when he finished fourth behind Saint Estephe, Triptych and Petoski. In July at Newmarket Racecourse Shardari started at odds of 5/2 for the Group Two Princess of Wales's Stakes and won from Baby Turk, with Petoski in third place. Shardari next ran in Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot. He was accompanied by his stable companions Shahrastani, winner of the Epsom Derby and Irish Derby and Dihistan, the winner of the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot. The rest of the field included Dancing Brave, Petoski and Triptych. After Petoski's two pacemakers dropped from contention, Shardari turned into the straight in second place behind Dihistan and took the lead two furlongs from the finish. He was quickly overtaken by Dancing Brave who opened up a clear lead, but then made a renewed challenge and reduced the leader's margin to three quarters of a length at the line. As a four-year-old, Shardari was conceding thirteen pounds to the three-year-old winner. On his next appearance, Sharadari was brought back in distance for the Matchmaker International over ten and a half furlongs at York. Ridden by Swinburn, he started the 13/8 favourite and recorded his only Group One victory, beating Triptych and Damister. Shardari's final European race was the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In an exceptionally strong field he finished fifth of the fifteen runners behind Dancing Brave, Bering, Triptych and Shahrastani. Two weeks later, Shardari was sent to Canada where he started favourite for the Rothmans International at Woodbine Racetrack but finished second to the Dogwood Stable's three-year-old Southjet. Stoute stated that the horse had been ill-suited by the soft ground Assessment In the official International Classification for 1985, Shardari was given a rating of 87, making him the sixth best three-year-old colt in Europe. The independent Timeform organisation awarded him a rating of 132, placing him fourth among his generation behind Slip Anchor (136), Petoski (135) and Shadeed (135). In the following year Shardari was the highest-rated older horse in the International Classification and was given a rating of 134 by Timeform. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Shardari the 149th best racehorse trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century. Stud record Shardari's stud record was disappointing with best flat race performers being horses which won at Group Three level: *Tashkourgan (filly 1988) won Group Three Premio Carlo Porta *Samourzakan (colt 1989) won Grade III Laurence Armour Handicap *Linnga (filly 1989) won Group Three Prix Minerve He had some success as a sire of National Hunt horses. Flame Creek won the Grade II Champion Hurdle Trial at Haydock Park Racecourse in 2003 whilst Walk On Seas was a successful hurdler in France. By 1999, the last recorded year in which he stood as a breeding stallion, Shardari was covering mares at a fee of £1,000.

His principal at Browning High School informed him that he would be going to college. He was accepted to Santa Clara University, a Jesuit school in California, on a full ROTC scholarship. Belcourt achieved the rank of second lieutenant in the United States Army through the Santa Clara ROTC program. He earned his bachelor's degree from Santa Clara and began to pursue a law degree from the University of Montana. He met his wife, Cheryl, while attending Montana. Belcourt moved back to California after law school, where he earned a master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley. He then returned to Montana, where resided on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and in Missoula before settling in Billings, Montana. He served as the President of the Blackfeet Community College. He served as the Executive Director of the Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council from 1998 to 2013. He has been widely credited with increasing the influence of the council. The Council, which was near bankruptcy in 1998, had just one employee when he began his tenure. Belcourt expanded the Council through development and grant writing. Under Belcourt, the Council acquired $5 million in funding in 2009 in combat alcohol abuse in Native American communities in Montana and Wyoming. Both of Montana's present United States Senators, Max Baucus and Jon Tester, sought Belcourt's advice on issues relevant to Native Americans, including the authorization of the Indian Healthcare Improvement Act and the creation of the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010. In February 2013, called public attention to the high suicide rates in Native American communities. Belcourt was also instrumental in the establishment of a regional branch of the Tribal Institutional Review Board. The University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health honored Belcourt as one of its Public Health Heroes in 2003 for his work on Native American health care issues. In 2007, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Montana. Gordon Belcourt died of a long illness at St. Vincent Healthcare in Billings, Montana, at 7 a.m. on July 15, 2013, at the age of 68. He was survived by his wife of 43 years, Cheryl, and seven of their eight children - Sol, Paul Thunder, Annjeanette Elise, Jaime Ruth, Ben David, Alex Anson and Sienna Noel. His eighth daughter, Elena Katie, was murdered in 2001, which increased his determination to fight violence and crime. U.S. Senator Max Baucus called Belcourt a \\"wise and trusted leader,\\" while Senator Jon Tester also praised him noting, \\"Gordon could always be counted on to use common sense to get to the heart of the issue and find a solution\\" whose death leaves \\"big shoes to fill.\\" References Category:1945 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Native American leaders Category:Montana lawyers Category:Blackfoot people Category:Santa Clara University alumni Category:University of Montana alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health alumni Category:People from Billings, Montana Category:People from Missoula, Montana Category:Native American history of Montana ","title":"Gordon Belcourt"},{"id":"40203747","text":"Romania competed at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics in Moscow, Russia, from 10–18 August 2013.

Camp Crane was a World War I United States Army Ambulance Service (USAAS) training camp, located in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Its mission was to train ambulance drivers to evacuate casualties on the Western Front in France. It was named for Brigadier General Charles Henry Crane, surgeon general of the Army in 1882-83. Today, the location of Camp Crane is used as the Allentown Fairgrounds History =Establishment= When the United States entered World War I, the status of American volunteers in Europe became uncertain because they now had a U.S. military obligation to fulfill. France, fearing the loss of ambulance volunteers, requested that the United States ensure the uninterrupted continuation of the vital service. U.S. leaders thus agreed to incorporate American volunteer ambulance units into the American Army and to continue their service at the front with the French.The U. S. Army Ambulance Service The Army organized a new ambulance corps for that purpose. War Department General Orders No. 75, which established the U.S. Army Ambulance Service (USAAS), was issued on 23 June 1917. However, even before that, beginning in mid-May, rumors of the Army being interested in establishing a training camp at the Allentown, Pennsylvania Fairgrounds began to circulate. The fairgrounds was established in 1889 by the Lehigh County Agricultural Society (LCAS) as a site to hold its annual fair and operated a farmer's market inside a large grandstand, built in 1908. The property, about 50 acres in size, also had a small horse racing track, stables and several exhibition halls.History of the Allentown Fairgrounds The LCAS and representatives of the United States Army concluded an agreement for the Army to lease the fairgrounds, and as a result of that agreement, an announcement was made by the LCAS that the Allentown Fair would be cancelled in 1917.Hellerich, Mahlon H, and Pennsylvania) Lehigh County Historical Society Allentown. Allentown, 1762–1987 : a 225-year history. Allentown, Pennsylvania: Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987 The Army assigned the fairgrounds to the USAAS and designated the site Camp Crane. It was named for Brigadier General Charles H. Crane, surgeon general from 1882 to 1883. Its mission was to train recruits as ambulance drivers, mechanics, orderlies and the other skills they would need on the Western Front. The also became the site of the USAAS headquarters. =Training= Unlike other Army camps which generally were located nearby, but outsides of towns and cities. Camp Crane was located in a city, although the West End of Allentown at the time was sparsely populated. Recruits began to arrive on 1 June. They were billeted in available fairgrounds buildings, including horse barns, pig pens, and horse cooling sheds. A large mess hall was established under the Fairgrounds Grandstands. The fairgrounds itself, a dirt and grass field, became a large tent city, with tents being erected for the recruits to live in. At the same time Camp Crane became the home of over eighty doctors and other members of three temporary field hospitals that used Allentown as a staging area. Nurses were housed in the nearby Nurses College of Allentown Hospital. Evacuation hospital units and mobile hospital and surgical units were also to come to Allentown to prepare for wartime duty in Europe. According to the camp’s commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Slee, the camp was originally only intended to house approximately 2,500 men. Before the camp was brought up to full speed, however, that number had increased to 4,500 and then to 7,500. As a result of the large numbers of men occupying such a small space, housing was an acute problem. Several additional buildings were constructed at the western end of the fairgrounds beginning in July 1917, and several others were built on the eastern end to relieve the overcrowding. Pup tents at Camp Crane, summer, 1917 Despite such makeshift quarters, the USAAS attracted the adventurous by offering the promise of quick and certain action in Europe. By 19 June 1917, over thirteen hundred volunteers were in training at Camp Crane; a week later, the number stood at thirty-three hundred. In all, 20,310 volunteers (2,085 officers and 18,225 enlisted) trained at Camp Crane between 1 June 1917 and 10 April 1919. In September 1917, the USAAS was joined by 150 gas mask instructors. They established a separate school for training gas mask instructors who would instruct soldiers about using the masks in France. Volunteers came from Army recruiting stations, predecessor volunteer ambulance units, and a variety of institutions and industrial organizations. Sponsors of USAAS sections included over forty universities and colleges. Harvard University, which had led in the number of volunteers for the American Field Service, set another record by providing three USAAS sections. Other sponsors included corporations, cities, and sports groups. Camp Crane Ambulances and Drivers The trainees were an exceptional group. Volunteers for the Army Ambulance Service were generally conscientious objectors, who did not want to serve in combat units. As such, many of them were undergraduate college students planning a medical career. The Ambulance Service was a way for them to satisfy their draft obligation and also for those men who wanted to support the war effort, but not to serve directly in combat. Many volunteers were medical students who wanted to do their part for the war effort. Fifteen All-American college football players among them became the nucleus of a team that played a winning season against a lineup that included Georgetown University, Penn State, and Fordham University, a few of which later played in the early National Football League teams of the 1920s. The camp band also attracted premier musical talent, also drawn from college bands and music schools around the country. John Philip Sousa was among the guest conductors. Lt. Col. Clarence P. Franklin, MC, who succeeded Colonel Persons as the camp commander, convinced Sousa to write a march for the Army Ambulance \\"Corps,\\" and the famous composer copyrighted the \\"USAAC March\\" in 1919. The USAAC band participated in several concerts and parades in the Allentown area, as well as bond drives to support the war effort. United States Army Ambulance Service Marching Band practicing at Camp Crane in the interior of the horse racing track. Note the large number of parked ambulances Trainees marching south on 17th Street past Allentown High School, 1918 Many writers also served in the USAAC. Their transition into the life of a soldier was recorded in letters, diaries, and literature. In 1917 John Dos Passos returned from service in France with Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps to find a draft notice awaiting him. Deciding to volunteer for the USAAS, he reported to Camp Crane. He later wrote of his \\"captivity\\" at \\"Syphilis Valley\\" where he said he had washed over a million windows. His novel Three Soldiers was based on his experiences there and featured characters he encountered in training at Camp Crane and later during his service in France. Other notable members of the USAAC who trained at Camp Crane were Ernest Hemingway, Harry Crosby, Ray Kroc, William A. Wellman, and Frank Buckles, whom became the last American World War I veteran. Those who had volunteered to go \\"over there\\" were frustrated when the Army did not quickly ship them to Europe and became bored with repetitive tasks, such as marching day after day. An auxiliary camp was established in August 1917 at Kern's Mill, about eight miles north of Allentown, and at Belzwood, five miles west of Norristown to take the overflow from Camp Crane. To provide even more space, in November a site was set up in-between Heilerman's Crossing and Guth's Station as if they were in trenches in France. Known as Guth Station, the trainees established an underground city, digging in about eight feet deep into the fields and erecting small shacks where they installed small stoves. The recruits found living in the mud and dirt trenches there to be particularly vexsome, but it was a good simulation of what they would find on the Western Front. For recreation, Camp Crane established football, tennis and track teams. The city of Allentown established a \\"Big Brother\\" program to work with young men in Allentown. Also the local YMCA provided phonographs, books and magazines. People invited recruits into their private homes for evenings away from the Camp, and local establishments held dances and other social outings. In time Camp Crane graduates did make it \\"over there.\\" The first contingent (Section) arrived in France on 21 August 1917, commanded by Colonel Jones, who left Camp Crane to head up the USAAS in France from headquarters in Paris. On 26 September, the commander in chief, A. E. F., requested that an additional 10 sections be sent to France as soon as possible, in addition to the 20 sections already there, plus 300 unassigned recruits.US Army Department of Medical History, The United States Army Ambulance Service Each section was composed of approximately \\"45 men, 20 Ford M1917 ambulances, 1 Ford touring car, 1 truck, and a kitchen trailer\\". Additional sections were deployed to France and also Italy from Camp Crane as they graduated. On 26 August 1918, the commanding officer at Camp Crane reported that 82 sections had been sent overseas and 8 had been disbanded, but that 31 sections were being organized and motor transport for them secured. The last contingent was sent to France on 2 November 1918. A total of 95 separate Sections were trained in Allentown and deployed to France; 22 were sent to Italy. Camp Crane also became a pre- embarkation camp in 1918, with thousands of men moving in and out rapidly, usually arriving and leaving on trains in the middle of the night with convoys of trucks rolling through the city to the fairgrounds. =Closure= Impromptu Armistice Day Peace Parade passing through Center Square, Allentown PA, 11 November 1918 With the Armistice with Germany announced on 11 November 1918, a massive parade was held, and several hundred of the recruits being trained at Camp Crane marched through the city. Afterward, training ended and the recruits began to leave for home. During the winter of 1918-1919 Army activities at Camp Crane began to wind down, and preparations began to close the camp and return it to the LCAS. Flags at Camp Crane were taken down for the last time in a ceremony held at noon on 10 April 1919 and the fairgrounds was turned back over to the Agricultural society. The men of the USAAC that had gone to France and Italy had hoped to be able to be demobilized in Allentown, but by the time of their return it was closed. The Army had made significant changes to the fairgrounds. A large steam-heating plant was installed with steam pipes dug throughout the fairgrounds which equipped all the buildings for heat. A large amusement hall with bowling alleys with a large library and a cinema was built. Numerous buildings for classes and barracks were also erected. Hand colored postcard of Camp Crane, 1918. Note the trees and grass of the fairgrounds. The buildings erected by the Army were mostly sold off and either moved to new locations or dismantled and used for wood to build new buildings. Over $120,000 worth of iron and steel from the buildings, along with the heating, piping, and other components were taken apart and sold off. In addition, huge piles of coal were left with over 4,000 tons that needed to be taken away.Microfilm reels, Allentown Public Library of \\"The Morning Call\\" Newspaper. However, by the end of August 1919, nearly all physical evidence of Camp Crane was gone, and the 1919 Allentown Fair was held at the site. In 1927, a stone monument to the men who trained at Camp Crane was erected at the Allentown Fairgrounds. In the 1960s it was moved to Allentown's West Park, a few blocks away.United States Army Ambulance Corps Service World War I Memorial - Allentown, Pennsylvania Another memorial can be found on the wall of the fairgrounds grandstand, near the ticket office which was placed there in 1972. =Commemoration= In 2017, to honor the camp's 100th anniversary, the nearby Lehigh Valley Heritage Museum gathered artifacts and pictures, along with a replica of a Ford ambulance used at the camp, for a yearlong exhibit; during the Allentown Fair the exhibit was moved to the fair's Agriplex building, where fairgoers were able to learn about the camp.

Winner of several awards, including the Nastro d'Argento 2013, it was shown in all major Italian cities.  Plot  The film is centered around narration of excerpts from Vincenzo Rabito's memoir, Terra Matta. Rabito begins with his background in Sicily. He was born in 1899, and at a young age, he was pulled out of school to earn a wage for his family after the death of his father. As a teenager, he was drafted to fight in World War I. In some excerpts, he relates some of the atrocities he committed during the war, including assisting a friend in sexually torturing a young Italian woman. Following the war, Rabito worked in German mines until the beginning of World War II. At the insistence of his mother, Rabito took a wife, with whom he had three children. The children are shown as fully grown men in present-day Italy, visiting their father's childhood home and relating their own memories of some events Rabito wrote about. Despite remaining distanced from his wife, Rabito took great pride in his children, particularly because they were all fully educated and literate. Rabito did not learn to write until he was an adult; the spelling in his memoir is largely based on phonetic transliterations of Sicilian language. Although Rabito is telling his own story, he is scarcely shown in the film. Instead, his narration generally underscores footage of war, images of Sicilian villages and countrysides, and images of his journals.  Production  Terramatta is narrated by Roberto Nobile, reading selections from the memoirs of Vincenzo Rabito. Rabito's three sons, Turi, Tano, and Giovanni also appear in the film. Images in the film are taken from the Cinecittà Luce and other private archives, along with more recent footage of Chiaramonte Gulfi (provided by Rabito's three sons) and surrounding Sicilian countryside. Original pages from Rabito's diary, preserved in the National Diary Archive () of Pieve Santo Stefano appear in the film. Release The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival on 6 September 2012.

This hospital is not only a local hospital for the city of Geneva, but also the reference hospital for the rest of the canton and, together with the CHUV Lausanne, the reference hospital for French- speaking Switzerland. It is attached to the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine, and is one of five university hospitals in Switzerland; the others are in Basel, Bern, Lausanne and Zurich.  History  In 1602, the General Hospital, created from the merger of seven medieval hospitals, was simultaneously a hospital, a hospice, an orphanage, a retirement home, an asylum and a reformatory. After becoming cantonal hospitals in 1856, the HUG were turned into university hospitals in 1995 as part of the hospital reform required by authorities. Today, the HUG are regional and reference hospitals for advanced medicine. They promote access to care for everyone and the development of centers of excellence in conjunction with the University of Geneva.Bernard Lescaze, 150 ans de l'hôpital cantonal aux HUG : une vision politique pour un hôpital public, Genève, Suisse, Editor: Médecine & Hygiène, Historical dates: * 1602 - The general hospital is founded by combining seven hospitals that existed in the Middle Ages. * 1712 - Reconstruction of the General Hospital at the site where the Geneva Courthouse is located today.« Historique des bâtiments du palais de justice », GE, 2016 http://ge.ch/justice/sites/default/files/justice/common/brochures/histoire/Historique_batiments_palais_justice.pdf * 1856 - Cantonal Hospital opens following the separation of social assistance duties, assigned to the General Hospice, and medical assistance duties. * 1875 - Maternity Division is established on Prévost-Martin Street, and the construction of several buildings in the hospital district begins.Philip Rieder, À l'orée de la vie: cent ans de gynécologie et d'obstétrique à la Maternité de Genève, Genève, Suisse, Médecine & Hygiène, 2007 ( et 9782880492502) * 1900 - Two asylums open outside the city: one in Loëx for terminal and non-contagious patients and one at the Bel-Air location, which becomes Belle-Idée, for the mental patients (psychiatry).Armand Brulhart, Du Mal de Saint-Antoine à Belle-Idée. 2 siècles de psychiatrie à Genève 1800 - 1950, vol. 1, Genève, Suisse, Georg Editeur, 2002Armand Brulhart, De Bel air à Belle-idée: 2 siècles de psychiatrie à Genève. 1950-2000, vol. 2, Genève, Suisse, Georg Editeur, 2003 ( et 9782825708507) * 1915 - The surgery facility is under construction, marking the development of a cutting-edge specialty in Geneva to secure a strong tradition. * 1943 - Phased construction of the Cluse-Roseraie location continues for a period of 50 years. * 1961 - The Children's Hospital opens to allow the Geneva pediatrics sector to develop an academic dimension that's linked to research and teaching. * 1972 - The Geriatric Hospital opens, now Trois-Chêne Hospital, which coincides with the emergence of medicine for the aging and research on the biology of aging. * 1992 - Commissioning of the Opera zone that is equipped with state-of-the-art operating rooms with laminar flow to fulfill the most advanced medical and technical requirements. * 1995 - The University Hospitals is created and organizes public hospitals into medical departments and promotes close collaboration with the health care system. * 2001 - Expansion work in Emergency, Maternity and the Children's Hospital is completed, * 2011 - Two projects launch: BatLab, dedicated to laboratories and research, and a new hospital building with rooms having 1 or 2 beds. * 2015 - BatLab opens [archive], a building dedicated to laboratories and research. * 2016 - Clinics in Joli-Mont (Geneva) and Montana (Crans-Montana (Valais)) join the HUG.« Les cliniques de Joli-Mont et Montana intègreront les Hôpitaux universitaires de Genève (HUG) le 1er juillet » [archive], Santé > Actualité, sur ge.ch, Direction générale de la Santé de l’État de Genève, 15 juin 2016 http://ge.ch/sante/actualites/cliniques-de-joli-mont-montana-integreront- hopitaux-universitaires-de-geneve-hug-1er-juillet * 2017 - The new Gustave Julliard hospital building opens.

He is known for designing one of the first steam hammers. Early years François Prudent Bourdon was born at Seurre in the Côte-d'Or department of France on 29 July 1797. He was educated in the College of Mâcon. His father owned mills and river boats in Mâcon, and François joined his business after leaving school. After several year, François Bourdon and his younger brother founded a workshop. At Saint-Laurent-sur-Saône, a town opposite Mâcon, Francois and his brother Auguste ran an establishment whose main purpose was steam-powered wheat milling. In 1824 Bourdon took out a patent for a new tugboat design. In 1824 at Lyon, on the Saône between la Mulatière and the île Barbe, Bourdon made several attempts at steam-powered towing. He ran into various difficulties, mostly not technical. Bourdon's first two boats, Océan and Méditerranée, were built at Saint-Laurent-sur-Saône in 1825–26. The two boats were both steam-powered, and both had two 20 hp engines. They had shallow drafts, so could navigate the river most of the year if the river were dredged. Bourdon had a vision of the Saône becoming the key link in a water route from the Mediterranean via the Rhone to Lyon, then north via the Saône towards a network of canals that would connect to the Loire and the Rhine. In 1826 Bourdon created a company for steam navigation of the Saône, but it was short-lived. Le Creusot In 1826 the English partners Manby and Wilson acquired the iron forging mills at Le Creusot in 1826. They employed Bourdon from 1827 to 1833 to run the workshop for maintaining the forges and tools. Bourdon's first job was to modernize the works by installing the high-powered rolling mills needed to manufacture long lengths of rail for the railway lines in France. In 1833 Bourdon traveled to the United States for three years to study the high-pressure steam engines used on the river boats there, including the engines built by the American engineer Oliver Evans. He learned many techniques during this trip. Works at Le Creusot in 2005 In 1836 the brothers Adolphe and Eugène Schneider acquired the works at Le Creusot with investments by François Alexandre Seillière and Louis Boigues. They hired Bourdon in March 1837 to modernize the plant, which had been idle for three years, and to run the mechanical engineering workshops. He was able to devote his time to his passion for mechanical invention and steam navigation. Bourdon built many boats for use on the Rhone and built the first French transatlantic iron boats. He was responsible for building le Crocodile, le Marsouin (1839), le Mistral (1840), le Siroco (1840), la Foudre and l'Ouragan (1841–42). The Citis was built at Pont sur l'Ognon on the Saône and completed at the Schneider factory at Chalon-sur-Saône. During its trials on 17 January 1841 the boiler exploded in the presence of Eugène Schneider, François Bourdon and his father-in-law Antoine Henri Pognon, mayor of Creusot and chief accountant of the works. Nine people died including Pognon, and many were injured. The accident was used in a campaign against the Creusot works by rivals who were interested in importing machinery from England. In 1843-44 Bourdon made five large river cargo boats, Creusot, Mississippi, Missouri, Althen and Talabot. Each of these modern-looking steam-powered boats was or more in length, but no more than in width. In 1848 he conceived the giants Océan and Méditerranée. Bourdon developed designs for hauling boats up an inclined plane. He designed a complete set of tools for construction of locomotives, and developed techniques for shaping iron components using a hydraulic press. Steam hammer The SS Sirius was the first steamboat to cross the Atlantic, in 1838, closely followed by the paddleboat SS Great Western, which began regular crossings. In 1840, a French law authorized construction of 18 similar trans- Atlantic steamers. The Schneiders won orders to build 450-horsepower steam engines to power four of them. A new type of hammer was needed for industrial production of the large forgings needed in these engines. The Creusot steam hammer of 1877, a huge hammer with a design evolved from Bourdon's original François Bourdon is best known for his invention of the steam hammer, an idea that is also attributed to the Scottish engineer James Nasmyth. In 1839, Bourdon conceived of the idea of directly attaching a mass of iron to the piston rod of a steam engine. Bourdon called his engine a Pilon and made detailed drawings of his design that he showed to all engineers who visited the works at Le Creusot. Around the same time, Nasmyth was faced with the problem of forging a diameter shaft for a paddle steamer, larger than any that had been previously made. He came up with his own steam hammer design, making a sketch dated 24 November 1839, but the immediate need disappeared when the practicality of screw propellers was demonstrated. Nasmyth also showed his design to all visitors. The Schneiders hesitated to build Bourdon's radical new machine. Bourdon and Eugène Schneider visited the Nasmyth works in England in the middle of 1840, where they were shown Nasmyth's sketch. Bourdon pointed out how he had solved some problems in his somewhat different design, leaving a sketch of it. Schneider saw the two leading engineers agreed that such a machine was practical and authorized construction. The first steam hammer in the world was built at Le Creusot in 1840. It weighed and lifted to . Bourdon filed the patent for the machine on 30 September 1841 and Schneider frères et Cie took out the definitive patent on 19 April 1842. Bourdon's machine had been operating for fifteen months when Nasmyth visited the Creusot works in April 1842 and saw it in action. Nasmyth's first steam hammer was built later that year after his return to England. In 1843' a dispute broke out between Nasmyth and Bourdon over priority of invention of the steam hammer. Nasmyth, an excellent publicist, managed to convince many people that he was the first. He would attend opening ceremonies for his hammers, and would demonstrate that they were so finely machined that it could crack the top of an egg sitting in a wine glass. However, it is clear that both men had invented the steam hammer independently, both trying to solve the same problem of forging shafts and cranks for the increasingly large steam engines used in locomotives and paddle boats. Exhibition \\"Metal, Machine and Men\\" created by the François Bourdon Académie in the town of Le Creusot Later career Bourdon began a fertile collaboration with his contemporary, the engineer Claude Verpilleux (1798-1875 ). During the French Revolution of 1848 both were elected to the constitutional assembly, although neither had the personalities for a career in politics. Bourdon was elected representative of Saône-et-Loire on 23 April 1848. He sat with the very moderate Republicans, supporters of General Louis- Eugène Cavaignac. In 1852 Bourdon became director of the Forges et chantiers de la Méditerranée (Mediterranean Forges and Factories). He built several machines for commercial boats and warships. He installed a large hydraulic machine at the Marseille docks designed by George Armstrong, the famous English engineer, among other works. François Prudent Bourdon died in Paris on 19 April 1865.

She served in several theatres, including the Battle of the Atlantic as an ocean escort. She was named for Drumheller, Alberta. Background Flower-class corvettes like Drumheller serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Drumheller was ordered 1 February 1940 as part of the 1939-1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down by Collingwood Shipyards Ltd. in Collingwood, Ontario on 4 December 1940 and launched 5 July 1941. Drumheller was commissioned at Montreal on 13 September 1941. She underwent two major refits during her career. The first came after developing mechanical defects during an ocean crossing. This led to a spell in 1942 at Southampton refitting. The second refit that Drumheller underwent took place at New York from mid-November 1943 until mid-January 1944 where her fo'c'sle was extended. War service After arrival at Halifax for workups, Drumheller was assigned to Sydney Force in November 1941. She was transferred to Newfoundland Command soon after and spent two months beginning in December 1941 as an ocean escort. In February 1942, Drumheller began the \\"Newfie\\" - Derry run, one of the first Canadian ships to do so. While on a return trip to St. John's, Drumheller developed mechanical defects and was forced to return to the United Kingdom for repairs. After completion of the repairs, she was assigned to Tobermory, the escort ship training site, for workups. She resumed her ocean escort duties at the end of April. In April 1942 after her return to active service, she was assigned to Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-2 and served with it until April 1944. In May 1943 Drumheller as escort to HX 237 teamed with an RAF Sunderland and to sink . Also during this time Drumheller was involved in the severe convoy battle surrounding ON 202/ONS 18 in September 1943 which lost six merchant ships and three escorts. In April 1944, she was assigned to Western Approaches Command for invasion duties. She took part in the invasion of Normandy and afterwards, in September of that year, transferred to Portsmouth Command. After a short stay, Drumheller transferred one last time, this time to Nore Command in November 1944. She stayed with them until the end of the war, when in mid-May 1945, she was sent home to Canada. Drumheller was paid off 11 July 1945. The ship was sold for scrapping on 30 August 1946 and was broken up in Hamilton in 1949.

She agrees once it is made clear that their relationship will be strictly business. On the road, they stop for dinner at Claude's Restaurant, where Bert knows the owner. The local sheriff, Bill Langley, recognizes Bert and tips off a revenge-minded man whose brother Bert killed. But given a warning by Claude what's about to happen, Bert shoots and kills the man. Charged with murder, Bert is defended by Milo Bragg, a smooth- talking Southern lawyer. Claude testifies that the killing was in self- defense. Ruth is expected to do the same, but when district attorney Arthur Sherbourne reminds her that she's under oath, Ruth breaks down and tells the truth.

There, prisoners are all literally \\"under the gun\\" of a ruthless trustee, Nugent, who is a convict like themselves but carries a rifle.

Bert has him dig up information about Gower, his fellow inmate. He learns that Gower's family was left in dire financial straits. Bert makes a proposition, saying he will pay the family $25,000 if Gower will try to escape. Guilt-ridden about his family, Gower agrees. He nearly makes it out safely before Bert kills him. Now paroled, Bert immediately tracks down Ruth, seeking vengeance for her testimony. Sheriff Langley is following, though, as they take a speedboat, then end up on foot in a swamp. Ruth gets her hands on Bert's gun, but cannot bring herself to shoot him. Langley has no such hesitation, taking aim and shooting Bert dead.

Construction The 17th-century Ottoman traveller Evliya Çelebi records that the mosque was begun under Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1389–1402), but after his death at the Battle of Ankara and the turmoil that followed, it was interrupted. Construction was taken up again under Sultan Mehmed I (r. 1413–1421), and the mosque was completed and inaugurated in March 1420, as recorded in the inscription above the main entrance. A second inscription over a side-entrance records the name of the architect Ivaz ibn Bayezid, the builder (donor) Dogan ibn Abdullah and the local qadi, Seyid Ali, who supervised construction. Structure The mosque is a square structure, approximately 30–32m on each side, including the walls. The mosque is built with cast stone technique and faced with limestone ashlar blocks, and its external walls are ca. 2.2–2.7m thick. There are two rows of windows, one at floor level and one above. The main entrance is on the south side, and secondary doors are on the eastern and western sides. The inner wooden roof with the interior dome From its layout, the building was apparently originally designed to be crowned by two large domes on the entrance axis, flanked by two smaller ones, while provision was made for addition of a portico surmounted by three smaller domes. The original design was abandoned and was replaced by a lead-covered wooden roof in the shape of a four-sided pyramid, which survives to this day. An interior roof of veneered wooden planks with a cupola, suspended below the actual roof, was added in the 17th century. The interior space is divided by four square-piers into a central square, which served as the main prayer area, and four elongated spaces around it. The mihrab is located on the southern wall, with a fresco depicting a heavenly city above it. The other walls are decorated with quotes from the Quran, prayers and invocations. The minaret is located on the south-eastern corner. Its upper portion was demolished in 1912, during the Bulgarian occupation in the First Balkan War, when it was converted into a church dedicated to Saint George, but rebuilt in 1913 when the Turks recovered the town. A second balcony was added to the minaret at that time. Importance and preservation The main entrance of the mosque The mosque is considered by Greek government officials one of the most important Muslim monuments, not only in Greece, but in all of Europe, as being the oldest mosque on European ground. It has been a protected monument since 1946. The early 15th-century oak roof constitutes \\"one of the most important wooden monuments in the world\\" according to A. Bakirtzis, author of a study on Ottoman architecture in Greece. The original lead sheathing was removed in the Second World War, and was replaced post-war first with sheet-metal covers, and later again with lead ones. These were removed in 1998 for repairs to the roof, but work stalled, and the roof was covered by a protective membrane instead, but this was torn in 2008, when a piece of the minaret fell on it. The structure remained in urgent need of repair, and was considered particularly endangered by a possible earthquake. Finally, on 23 November 2010, the Central Archaeological Council decided on the resumption of restoration work, which is to be funded by national sources as well as using EU funding programmes. In the early hours of 22 March 2017, during the course of restoration work on the roof, the mosque caught fire. The fire was extinguished after a few hours, but the entire roof was destroyed; damage to the interior and the walls remains unknown.

Based on \\"Quai d'Orsay\\", a comic strip by Christophe Blain and Abel Lanzac, the film takes an initially comedic look at the French Foreign Ministry under Dominique de Villepin but moves into more serious territory as France, in co-operation with Germany, opposes the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. It was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. In January 2014, the film received three nominations at the 39th César Awards, with Niels Arestrup winning the award for Best Supporting Actor. Plot After graduating from the École nationale d'administration, which trains France's leaders in the public and private sectors, Arthur Vlaminck lands a job as speechwriter in the Foreign Ministry. Existing senior advisers do not welcome a talented newcomer who may become a competitor but his abilities are recognised by the Minister and, most important, by Maupas, the career official heading the department. That said, coming up with the right words for the constantly changing world situation and the constantly changing reactions of the Minister proves no easy task. He gets hastily written drafts past Maupas, and past other senior advisers who rubbish them, only to find that the Minister's needs have changed. The film ends in February 2003 with a re-enactment of the actual speech by Dominique de Villepin to the UN Security Council, at which he contradicted claims by Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld and argued passionately for disarmament of Iraq but not invasion.

It currently supports guitar, piano, ukulele, bass, and voice. The application is available on iOS, Android, Windows and macOS platforms. Yousician analyses the users’ playing on their real musical instruments, and provides them with instant feedback and guidance. Yousician claims to be the world's largest music educator. History Yousician Ltd. is a Helsinki based music education company founded by Chris Thür and Mikko Kaipainen in 2010 under the name Ovelin, and was part of the Startup Sauna accelerator programme at Aalto University. Yousician states its mission as \\"Making musicality as common as literacy\\". The company develops and operates a music service called Yousician, and a tuner application called GuitarTuna. As of December 2016, Yousician claims over 8 million monthly active users worldwide across their products. In 2012, the company raised $1.4m from Silicon Valley-based investor True Ventures. Yousician The Yousician service is built on audio signal processing technology that can recognize notes and chords played by its users on their real instruments (both acoustic and electric). Users are shown either a gamified, colourful version of sheet music or tablature notation for an exercise, and hear a backing track as they play along. Using the built-in microphone of the device, Yousician listens to the users play, gives feedback on accuracy and timing, and tracks users’ progress over time. Yousician is currently available for five topics: guitar, piano, bass, ukulele, and voice. For every instrument, Yousician features a syllabus developed and produced in- house by the company. Syllabi are made up of songs and exercises, tutorial videos and mini-games to learn new skills. Over all instruments, there are around 150 missions and over 25,000 exercises available. Yousician used to offer a user generated content platform where users can create their own content via an in-built editor for their own usage, or choose to share it with the community. There are some features available that do not require an instrument, e.g. ear-training or theory practice while people don't have instruments at hand. Yousician operates under a freemium model where one lesson per day is given for free, while unlimited lesson time is offered via paid subscriptions. =Guitar= Yousician for Guitar was the first instrument launched on the platform when it was released in November 2014. The syllabus of guitar is divided into 3 paths: Lead, Rhythm and Knowledge. The standard visualization for guitar is a tablature view, but users can also choose to display songs as sheet music or a hybrid of the two. =Piano= Yousician for Piano was the second instrument launched on the platform in November 2015. The syllabus of piano is divided into 3 paths: Classical, Pop and Knowledge. The standard visualization for piano is a simplified version of sheet music, but users can also choose to display songs as traditional sheet music. =Ukulele= Yousician for Ukulele was the third instrument launched on the platform in December 2015. The syllabus of ukulele is divided into 3 paths: Lead, Rhythm and Knowledge. The standard visualization for ukulele is a tablature view, but users can also choose to display songs as sheet music or a hybrid of the two. =Bass= Yousician for Bass was the fourth instrument launched on the platform in April 2016. The syllabus of bass is divided into 2 paths: Playing and Knowledge. The standard visualization for bass is a tablature view, but users can also choose to display songs as sheet music or a hybrid of the two. =Voice= Yousician for Voice was the fifth instrument launched on the platform in August 2018. There's a single path in the syllabus. The visualization is a chromatic staff where notes are represented by bars, comparable to some other singing applications such as SingStar. Yousician for Educators Yousician for Educators is a service built on the Yousician platform for teachers using Yousician with their students, both for in-classroom and for the students to practice at home. Teachers are able to assign and monitor homework tasks and student progression from the Educator Dashboard. As of February 2017, Yousician claims the service is being used by thousands of teachers around the world. Yousician has a “Distinguished Educators” section featuring teachers that help other teachers to utilize Yousician in their classrooms. Yousician for Educators uses a freemium model for teachers and their students, although they previously had a free model for teachers. Reception Yousician was released on November 2014, to mostly positive reviews. Guitar World called it \\"modern technology's gift to music education\\" and in March 2015 it was featured as 'Editor's Choice' in the Apple iOS App Store. Critical voices usually do not question the product itself, but contrast it to the option of learning to play an instrument in private lessons. Voicesinc.org for example stated that “If you’re happy to learn from a digital screen, then it’s great, but if you want a lot more human interaction and demonstration, there may be some better options.” As of October 2018, the Yousician app had 227,660 ratings on Google Play with an average 4.5 of the 5-star rating and on the iOS App Store 10,076 ratings with an average of 4.3 of the 5-stars. Yousician was featured two times as 'Editor's Choice' in the iOS App Store and won a \\"Best of 2016 Apps\\" award from Google Play. Yousician was one of Wired's top 100 European startups in 2012, and were also featured in The Sunday Times \\"World's Best Apps List 2012\\". Yousician and its apps have won several technology and start-up competitions, including SXSW Accelerator 2012 (Music) and Midemlab 2012. In June 2018 Yousician began what the company has called a \\"sunset of the song upload feature\\" which was completed with the October 2018 update 2.58 that removed all user generated content from the app. The removal of user generated content sparked opposition among some vocal users online. Coincidence with introduction of what Yousician calls popular songs, licensed songs by well- known bands and artists, that was announced with the update 2.55 on 23rd of August 2018 led to speculation about the motives of the decision, however Yousician as a company has not elaborated on the reasons of their business move. Legal The creators of Yousician had been sued by Ubisoft over claimed patent infringement on their patent U.S. Patent 9,839,852, for an \\"Interactive guitar game\\", which Ubisoft had used in their game Rocksmith. In August 2019, a federal district court ruled that the patent claims of Ubisoft were too broad and not defined in enough specificity, nullifying the patent and dismissing Ubisoft's suit.

It is located in Roujan commune, Hérault département, Occitanie. The Augustinian priory was founded in 1080, on land donated by the Alquier noble family of Béziers A new church was consecrated on 6 October 1115. The second prior was Saint Guiraud (d. 1123). Numerous relics were collected by the priory and it served as a cemetery to the nobility of the region. The lands owned by the priory extended to 75 villages. Pope Innocent III in the context of the crusade against the Cathars exempted the priory from control by the bishops of Béziers, making it subject only to the Holy See in spiritual matters. In secular terms, the monastery pledged allegiance to Louis IX of France in 1268. In the 14th century the priory began to decline, as a result of the Black Death and the turmoils of the Hundred Year's War, and the number of canons halved, from 80 in the 13th century to 40 by 1384. The monastery was pillaged during the wars of religion, in 1539, and again in 1563. By 1605, the monastic community was moribund, reduced to seven or eight canons. In 1671, it was attached to Sainte-Geneviève abbey in Paris. The medieval buildings were torn down and the estate was rebuilt from scratch in the mid 18th century under prior Pas de Beaulieu, except for the church building, which was modified but retains its 12th century romanesque core structure. After the French revolution, the monastery was dissolved and the property nationalised, in 1791 it was sold to an advocate, Marc Antoine Thomas Mérigeaux, who bought it on behalf of a Prince de Conti who offered it to his mistress, Madame de Brimont. From this point, the former monastery became known as Château de Cassan or Cassan castle. It changed hands several times during the 19th and 20th centuries, eventually passing to the French state, housing administrative offices, but in 1995 sold again to a private party, and in 2002 to a real estate holding. The priory church and the western wing of the castle were classed as a national historical monument in 1953.

It was a medieval trading center.  Location  Sveti Srđ emerged near the Benedictine Shirgj Monastery, an abbey dedicated to Sergius and Bacchus built in the 11th century. Due to its favorable geographical position near the mouth of the river Bojana, it grew to surpass other towns of the region.  History  Since the reign of Stefan Nemanja in the Serbian Grand Principality, Sveti Srđ was one of four markets allowed to trade salt (the other three being Kotor and Drijeva while Dubrovnik joined them after it was established as a republic in the mid 14th century) in the Serbian maritime. Although a lot of wood was transported by Bojana, Sveti Srđ was not a trading place for wood, but instead for salt and leather. It was one of two customs areas of the region (the other one was Danj on the river Drin). In 1330 near Sveti Srđ, the King of Serbia Stefan Dečanski met with envoys of Dubrovnik who congratulated him on his victory in the Battle of Velbazhd. On that occasion, Dečanski asked them to support his military campaigns with six galleys. After the collapse of the Serbian Empire in 1371, Sveti Srđ belonged to Zeta until 1392 when Ottomans captured Zeta's lord Đurađ II Balšić. They soon released him after they first captured Danj, Skadar and Sveti Srđ. In autumn 1395 Balšić recaptured his towns including Sveti Srđ. Knowing he would not be able to keep those towns if Ottomans decided to capture them he ceded them to the Venetians. Soon, in 1397, Danj was granted the right to trade salt. Thus, the Venetian takeover ended the monopoly on salt trading that Sveti Srđ had held in the Bojana region for centuries while it was in Serbia. A peace treaty signed in Sveti Srđ in 1423 ended the Second Scutari War waged between the Serbian Despotate (initially Zeta) and the Venetian Republic over Scutari and other former possessions of Zeta controlled by Venice. This treaty is known as the Peace of Sveti Srđ. While it was in Venetian hands the salt traded in Sveti Srđ had to be transported from, also Venetian controlled, Corfu. In 1479, Ottomans captured the remaining part of the region of northern Albania and this market soon became deserted.

An American version called Lexion was produced by Claas Omaha Inc. in the United States.  History  The Lexion was presented in 1995. The first model was the Lexion 480. It has a harvesting capacity of 40 t of grain per hour and was at that time the most powerful combine harvester in the world. The Lexion 480 had the same accelerator drum in front of the threshing drum as the Claas Mega, but it came with a bigger threshing drum (600 mm diameter and 1700 mm width instead of 450 mm diameter and 1580 mm width). Instead of the straw walkers, the Lexion 480 had two separation rotors installed. As a result, the unit ran smoothly and the throughput was much higher than in a conventional straw-walker machine. From 1999, Claas worked with the US agricultural and construction machinery manufacturer Caterpillar and sold the Lexion combines in North America under the CAT brand. In 2002, Claas took over 50% of the joint venture with Caterpillar and the combine harvester production in the United States. The harvesters produced there were then still marketed as CAT Lexion. At the 2005 Agritechnica exhibition, Claas presented the Lexion 600, with a cutting width of up to 12 m (39.37 feet), a grain tank capacity of 12,000 liters (330 Bushels) and a performance up to 60,000 kg per hour. This was again the most powerful combine harvester in the world. In 2010, Claas presented the Lexion 700. In 2013, Claas introduced new emission standards (Tier 4).

The dorsal profile is straight from the snout to the nape, then there is a bugle between the head and the start of the dorsal fin. The ventral profile is evenly curved from the tip of the lower jaw to the anus. The upper jaw is slightly longer than the lower jaw and the mouth is oblique and equipped with villiform teeth with much larger teeth in the outer row. The lateral line is continuous and evenly curved. The dorsal fin is continuous, the spiny part is low and contains 11-13 spines and is arched in shape with the fifth to seventh spines being the longest although the longest dorsal spine is shorter than the longest dorsal soft ray, the soft-rayed part of the dorsal fin is rounded and contains 13-14 soft rays. All 3 anal spines are short, robust and curved with the first one being half as long as second soft anal rounded with the third being slightly shorter than the second. The anal fin soft rays are all longer than the spines and there are 11-12 of them. The caudal fin is rounded to truncate.

Many of Taiwanese dramas, songs as well as idol actors, singers, bands or groups have become popular throughout East Asia and Southeast Asia. History Towards the turn of the 21st century, despite the early success of the Hallyu-wave, there was an equally noticeable growth in cultural imports from Taiwan, which, like South Korea, is also one of the Four Asian Tigers. The spread of Taiwanese popular culture occurred slightly earlier, before the Hallyu-wave was known in Asia. In 2001, the Taiwanese drama \\"Meteor Garden\\" was released and soon attracted audiences from all over the region. It became the most-watched drama series in Philippine television history, garnered over 10 million daily viewers in Manila alone, and catapulted the male protagonists from the Taiwanese boyband F4 to overnight fame. Their popularity spread throughout Asia, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Philippines. With their success, many other Taiwanese boy bands emerged around this time, such as 5566, 183 Club and Fahrenheit. In 2002, a BBC journalist described the members of F4 as previously unknown actors who have \\"provoked hysteria across Asia\\" as a result of the success of \\"Meteor Garden\\". The popularity of \\"Meteor Garden\\" (an adaptation of the Japanese manga series Boys Over Flowers by Yoko Kamio) can be attributed to these two factors: * Emotional engagement of the audience with particular emphasis on forging an emotional bond with the protagonist * Explicit attention to female sexual desires — Departing from conventional dramas that tend to eroticize the female body, \\"Meteor Garden\\" markets the sexual attraction of the male actors (as played out by the Taiwanese idol group F4), giving women a certain freedom of sexual expression. The Four Asian Tigers As a result of the success of \\"Meteor Garden\\", its sequel \\"Meteor Garden II\\" was gradually released into many Asian countries as well, before the source material was later adapted by networks in Japan, South Korea, and China respectively. In 2002, the Korean drama \\"Winter Sonata\\" became the first of its kind to equal the success of \\"Meteor Garden\\", attracting a cult following in Asia with sales of Winter Sonata-related products such as DVD sets and novels surpassing US$3.5 million in Japan. Since 2002, television programming trends in Southeast Asia began to undergo a drastic change as TV series from South Korea and Taiwan filled the slot originally reserved for Hollywood movies during prime time. Although dramas from South Korea gradually overtook those from Taiwan, much of Asia still had their eyes focused on Taiwanese bands such as F4, S.H.E and Fahrenheit. The breakthrough for K-pop came with the debut of TVXQ, SS501\\"WBW: SM vs. DSP\\".Allkpop. Retrieved 2013-07-18. and Super Junior, the latter hailed by the BBC as a household name in the region. By the late 2000s, many Taiwanese music acts could no longer catch up with their K-pop counterparts. Although a number of Taiwanese bands such as F4 and Fahrenheit continued to retain a small but loyal fan base in Asia, teenagers and young adults from all over the world were much more receptive to K-pop bands such as Big Bang and Super Junior, both of whom have managed to attract a huge number of fans from South America, parts of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and more recently, the Western world. In Japan K-pop is actually only one of two popular trends going on over in Japan, and the other trend is Taiwanese pop (sung in Mandarin). There is even a word for it in Japanese called 台流 (pronounced Tairyū), which literally means the influx of Taiwanese pop culture in Japan. This trend has been prevalent in Japan for quite some time though, with Taiwanese idol dramas like Meteor Garden, It Started with a Kiss, Hot Shot, and soon Autumn's Concerto making waves in Japan, while Japanese artists like Gackt making frequent visits to Taiwan for pleasure. Today, the Taiwanese male singer Show Lo has been regarded as leading the Taiwanese wave in Japan. On 15 February 2012, he made his foray into the Japanese music scene, with the release of his first Japanese single Dante. The single peaked at number 10 on the Oricon chart within the first week of its release. He is the second Taiwanese singer to make it into the Oricon chart in the past 25 years after the veteran singer Teresa Teng, and the first Taiwanese male singer to make it into the top 10 positions on the chart. The Japanese media even praised that he is the Taiwanese version of Japanese idol Yamashita Tomohisa.

Kehl (December 14, 1837 – September 12, 1909) was an American merchant, miller, logger and banker from Wisconsin who served a one-year term as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from Dane County before eventually settling in Chippewa Falls.  Background  Kehl was born December 14, 1837 in Schwabsburg near Oppenheim in Hesse-Darmstadt, the son of Peter Kehl, who came to Milwaukee in April, 1845, remaining there about five months, then settled with his family in Sauk City. They lived there until 1855, when they moved to the town of Roxbury in Dane County. The elder Kehl began practicing viniculture in 1850, becoming the pioneer of that industry in Wisconsin. In July, 1860, Kehl went into the mercantile business for himself. In 1866 Kehl switched from being a merchant to milling, doing commercial and custom milling at Blue Mounds. He settled in Vermont, Wisconsin.  Public office  Having held several local office, Kehl was elected to the Assembly for a one-year term in 1873, representing the Third District of Dane County (the Towns of Towns of Berry, Black Earth, Cross Plains, Dane, Mazomanie, Roxbury, Springfield, Vermont, Vienna and Westport). He was elected as a Democrat, with 1,162 votes, to 598 for Republican W. N. Hawes (the incumbent, Democrat Otto Kerl, was not a candidate); but in the 1874 Wisconsin Blue Book chose to list himself as a \\"Conservative Democrat\\", to distinguish himself from the majority of Wisconsin Democratic legislators who had affiliated with the Reform Party, a short-lived coalition of Democrats, reform and Liberal Republicans, and Grangers formed in 1873, which had secured the election of William Robert Taylor as Governor of Wisconsin,William Robert Taylor, Wisconsin Historical Society as well as electing a number of state legislators. He was the only Democrat to do so. He was assigned to the standing committee on state affairs.Turner, A. J., ed.

In the spring of 1874, Kehl came to Chippewa Falls and began construction of the Glen Mills, one and a half miles from Chippewa Falls. In the winter of 1875-76, he went into logging, and continued logging operations in connection with his other affairs. He operated the Glen Flouring Mills for A. E. Pound & Co., from 1876 to 1878, when he purchased the business for himself. In 1875, he became interested in the First National Bank as stockholder and director, and became vice-president of the bank. He had extensive investments in real estate in Dane and Sauk counties, and was a director of the company that published the Chippewa County Independent.  Personal life  Kehl was married in Livingston, New Jersey on September 9, 1863, to Susie F. Wright, a native of that town, born in 1840. They had three children (Jessie I., Ida Stella, and Frederick W.).
