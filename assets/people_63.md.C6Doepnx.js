He gained recognition in the 1980s for his popular-culture-influenced, violent, highly physical plays. Building upon this early work with later projects of social criticism and postmodern theatrical experimentation, Kawamura secured his position as an internationally recognized theatre artist. As artistic director of theatre companies Daisan Erotica and T Factory, Kawamura uses his plays to comment directly and indirectly on Japanese social conditions and current events while prompting audiences to consider issues such as the shaping influences of media, the confusion of reality with fantasy, and the nature of human individuality. 1980s: Early work Born in Tokyo in 1959, Kawamura established his first company, Daisan Erotica, in 1980, while studying at Meiji University.Program notes 2 Kawamura wrote, directed, and sometimes acted in the young company’s productions, which took inspiration from the Japanese angura (underground) theatre of the 1960s and 1970s and from Western and Japanese popular culture.Martin 109-110 Drawing upon and reacting to the work of such angura playwright/director/actors as Terayama Shūji, Suzuki Tadashi, and Kara Jūrō, Kawamura embraced their experimental focus and avant-garde physicality while rejecting their desire to reconcile the present with the past and their faith in social activism. In drawing from angura, Kawamura also absorbed at second-hand the ideas of Western theatre artists, such as Antonin Artaud’s violent, irrational Theatre of Cruelty; Samuel Beckett’s wistful absurdism; and Bertolt Brecht’s desire to keep an audience aware and critical of theatrical and social artifice.Senda xvii Other, direct Western influences included the films of directors like Ridley Scott (Blade Runner)Senda 211 and Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, Straw Dogs).Eckersall, “Japan” 104 Combining all of these influences, Kawamura’s early plays, created with Daisan Erotica, included Radical Party (1983), about a group of young, nihilistic male prostitutes, rebelling “in opposition to nothing whatsoever”;Senda 145 Genocide (1984), in which a young man steps into and becomes trapped in “the film he wishes he could see”;Senda 216 and Eight Dogs of Shinjuku: Volume 1, Birth of Dogs (1985), a deconstruction of a classic Japanese novel series, re- set in Shinjuku’s underground gay culture. Eight Dogs of Shinjuku won Japan’s premiere award for new plays, the Kishida Kunio Drama Award.;Eckersall, “Japan” 98 but an earlier play, Japan Wars, remains Kawamura’s most-referenced work in the Western world. Japan Wars Written in 1984, Japan Wars follows a group of young people who wake up trapped aboard a submarine, recalling only that they were once “radical activists.” They gradually discover that they are actually androids, programmed as soldiers; all of their “human” memories are false, carefully chosen and implanted to control their thoughts and actions in a war against mutant cows who have overrun the planet. At the play’s climax, the androids rebel, only to learn that their desire for “revolution” also comes from programming secretly implanted by the cows to keep them from being milked; their shadowy creators have engineered even their disobedience, in order to prepare them for war.Senda 210 Some critics view the piece as a “superlative” example of Japanese theatre in the 1980s – theatre written by young artists disillusioned with the rampant commercialism of Japan’s “bubble economy,” skeptical of all motives and desires, imagining the future as bleak, meaningless, and inescapable.Senda 211, 215 The myth of the individual identity, the overlap of reality and “created” reality (fiction perceived as reality), violence as a reaction “programmed” by a subtle power structure, and youth as the focus of corrupting forces all recur often in Kawamura’s later projects. 1990s: International recognition In the 1990s, Kawamura’s work began to gain recognition overseas. His 1990 production A Man Called Macbeth toured North America in 1992, playing at the International Theatre Festival of Chicago; set in the Japanese criminal underworld, this version of Macbeth incorporated framing scenes in which the young Macbeth commented on the action to a police interrogator.Moy 103, 104-105 Kawamura returned to the U.S. in 1997, after receiving a grant to study New York City theatre, and again in 1998, to direct two productions as a guest director for New York University’s Department of Drama, Tisch School of the Arts. In this same decade, Kawamura’s productions with Daisan Erotica moved away from indirect social criticism, cloaked in science fiction, towards direct, pointed commentary on Japanese current events and social conditions. Tokyo Trauma (1995) came out of a need to comment on the twin catastrophes of the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the sarin gassing of Tokyo subway trains by Aum cultists.Martin 113 Obsession Site (1996) dealt with Japan’s colonial invasions of Korea and China and with issues such as racism, homelessness, street violence, and social apathy. Kawamura also began to employ video projections in his pieces, as well as modern dancers and dance techniques.Eckersall, “Japan” 103-104 2000s: Further experimentation The 2000s have seen further changes in Kawamura’s work, though his interest in social concerns, in violence as socially programmed, and in the confusion of reality and fantasy remain constant. Returning to the deconstruction of preexisting texts that he first explored in Eight Dogs of Shinjuku and A Man Called Macbeth, Kawamura presented Hamletclone in 2000. The piece examined Japanese current events and social frictions using live actors, image projections, video footage, modern dance, and extensive sound design, while also paying tribute to German postmodern playwright Heiner Müller’s Hamletmachine – itself a pastiche and deconstruction of Shakespeare and many other sources.“HAMLET” Kawamura’s interest in dissecting and reinventing texts went one step further in 2001, when he revisited his own 1980s “classic,” Japan Wars. The new version, Japan Wars (2), vivisected the original text using the same framing device with which Kawamura had manipulated Shakespeare in A Man Called Macbeth: An interrogator asks one character, here one of the androids, to recall the action of the original play. Incorporating images of the World Trade Center attacks and ending the piece with the phrase “The film is finished,” the production again questioned the boundaries between reality and constructed media.Eckersall, “Surveillance” Post-Daisan-Erotica Kawamura reconstructed his company itself the following year, renaming it T Factory; Daisan Erotica became the name of an affiliated venue for actor training and play development. T Factory staged a revival of Hamletclone, similar to that of Japan Wars, in 2003. Kawamura’s most recent piece to tour North America (in 2007 and continuing into 2008), AOI/KOMACHI, adapts much older source material. The production places two 15th-century traditional Japanese noh plays in modern settings, drawing on horror film influences and critiquing the cult of celebrity.“Takeshi” Selected works * Seikimatsu Love (1980) * Radical Party (1983). * Japan Wars (1984). * Genocide (1984). * Eight Dogs of Shinjuku: Volume 1, Birth of Dogs (1985) (Kishida Kunio Drama Award-winner). * Last Frankenstein (1986). * Freaks (1987). * Imperial AIDS Strikes Back (1988). * A Man Called Macbeth (1990). * Last Frankenstein (film version, Kawamura as director) (1992). * Grand Guignol (1994). * The Dissection Room (1995). * Tokyo Trauma (1995). * Obsession Site (1996). * Oedipus, Why?

In 1921 she was elected as the first woman president of the Northern Baptist Convention (and of any religious denomination in the United States). She had long been a delegate to the Convention and a policymaker. In 1893 she helped found a chapter of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Rochester, New York, and served as president until 1911, nearly two decades. In 1899 Montgomery was the first woman elected to the Rochester School Board and any public office in the city, 20 years before women could vote. Montgomery was an activist for women's and overseas missions and a successful fundraiser; in 1910-1911 she raised one million dollars by her national speaking tour (the funds raised were equivalent to $23.7 million in 2010), used chiefly to support colleges for women in China. In 1921 as president of the Women's American Baptist Foreign Missionary Society, she gave their \\"Jubilee\\" contributions of more than $450,000 to the National Baptist Convention. In 1924 she was the first woman to publish a translation of the New Testament from the original Greek. Living mostly in Rochester, New York, she was influential in national and international progressive movements. Since 1995, Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School has held an annual conference on Women in Church and Society, named in honor of Helen Barrett Montgomery. In addition, the School is establishing an endowed fund in her name for its Program for the Study of Women and Gender in Church and Society. Early life and education Helen was the eldest of three children born to Amos Judson Barrett and Emily Barrows Barrett, both of whom were then teachers. She was born in Kingsville, Ohio. Her parents moved to Rochester, New York when she was a child so that her father could attend the Rochester Theological Seminary.\\"About Helen Barrett Montgomery\\" , Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School, accessed 14 July 2011 After he graduated in 1876, he was called as pastor of Lake Avenue Baptist Church in the city. He served there until his death in 1889, when Helen was 28. Helen Barrett studied at Wellesley College, where she graduated with teacher certification in 1884. She had studied and excelled in Greek, leading her class. (Later she would write and publish a translation of the New Testament.) She taught in Rochester and then at the Wellesley Preparatory School in Philadelphia.\\"Helen Barrett Montgomery\\" , Western New York Suffragists, Winning the Vote, Rochester Regional Library Council, 2000, accessed 14 July 2011 Marriage and family On September 6, 1887, Barrett married a Rochester businessman, William A. Montgomery, owner of North East Electric Company. (This eventually became the Rochester Products Division of General Motors). They adopted a daughter, whom they named Edith Montgomery. Public career Helen Barrett Montgomery's life work may be described under four headings: church, social reforms to benefit women, Bible translation, and missions. She has been described by the scholar Kendal Mobley as a \\"domestic feminist\\": > While she supported women's suffrage and believed women had rights as > citizens to share political power, she emphasized the value to society of > women's moral influence. She did not question the validity of the idea of > separate spheres for men and women. Instead, she argued that the limits of > woman's sphere were too narrow, and in her theory and practice she > conceptualized a woman's sphere that was in fact limitless. Like many other > Progressives, she believed that the moral influence of True Womanhood and > the values of the Victorian home ought to be extended throughout the state > and the society. Church and Northern Baptist Convention Barrett Montgomery stayed on at Lake Avenue Baptist Church. (Her father died two years after her marriage.) In 1892, the congregation licensed her to preach (not the same as ordination as a minister). She organized and taught a women's Bible class at the church, which she led for 44 years in the midst of her other activities. Her involvement and leadership in church circles and the city's women's movement led Montgomery to serve as a delegate to annual meetings of the Northern Baptist Convention, the association of Northern Baptist churches, where she helped decide policy. The Convention was formed in 1907, bringing together most Baptists in the North who were associated with the historical missions to establish schools and colleges for freedmen in the South after the American Civil War. Now the American Baptist Churches USA, the association of Northern Baptist churches was also active in missions to Asia, particularly China. In 1921, Montgomery was the first woman to be elected president of the Northern Baptist Convention (NBC), and at the same time, became the first woman president of any religious denomination in the United States.\\"The Helen Barrett Montgomery Endowed Fund for the Program for the Study of Women and Gender in Church and Society\\" , Statement for Campaign Support, Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School, accessed 14 July 2011 As president of the Women's American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, she had given their gift of more than $450,000 to the NBC. She was elected after having demonstrated her successful fundraising. During her year as president of the NBC, Montgomery spent considerable time in trying to prepare the churches for a new \\"statement of faith.\\" She worked to prevent the Convention from being taken over by fundamentalists and requiring an official confession. Her correspondence during this period showed that she was motivated by her \\"defense of the cherished Baptist principle of liberty.\\" Speaking to the third Baptist World Congress in 1923, Montgomery said, \\"Jesus Christ is the great Emancipator of woman. He alone among the founders of the great religions of the world looked upon men and women with level eyes, seeing not their differences, but their oneness, their humanity.\\"Mobley, Kendal P. \\"The role of women and women's issues in the Baptist World Alliance: in 2005, the Baptist World Alliance (BWA) celebrated the centennial anniversary of its inaugural meeting\\", Baptist History and Heritage, January 2006, accessed 14 July 2011 She strongly believed that women had an active role to play in the church and society. Social reforms to benefit women Montgomery worked on social reforms in the United States, especially those to benefit women. In 1893, she joined with Susan B. Anthony, the activist for civil rights who was nearly 40 years older, in forming a new chapter of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union (WEIU) in Rochester. Montgomery served as president from 1893-1911, which \\"enabled her to exert broad influence in the city's social and political affairs.\\"Mobley, Kendal. 2005. \\"Susan B. Anthony and Helen Barrett Montgomery: An Intergenerational Feminist Partnership\\", Baptist History & Heritage 40, Summer 80–90, accessed 14 July 2011 She and Anthony worked together for more than a decade on women's issues in Rochester. Following the example of chapters in Buffalo and Boston, the WEIU of Rochester served poor women and children in the city, which was attracting many Southern and Eastern European rural immigrants for its industrial jobs. The WEIU also founded a legal aid office, set up public playgrounds, established a \\"Noon Rest\\" house where working girls could eat unmolested, and opened stations for mothers to obtain safe milk, which later developed as public health clinics. It developed as one of the most important Progressive institutions in the city. Montgomery also became known in the city for her advocacy of education. Aided by the support of many women's groups, in 1899 she was the first woman elected to the Rochester School Board, as well as to any public office in Rochester, 20 years before women had the right to vote. She was elected during a time when women had few public roles and rarely spoke in such venues. She was re-elected and served a total of 10 years as a member of the Board. During her tenure, Montgomery implemented several reforms to the public school system, such as introducing kindergarten and vocational training in public schools, and including health education in the curriculum. In 1898, Montgomery and Susan B. Anthony responded to a challenge by the trustees of the University of Rochester, who had voted to make it coeducational if women's groups raised $100,000 to help with expenses. They led 25 women's clubs in the city to raise money for a fund to support the admission of women students, reaching agreement with the trustees after collecting $50,000 by 1900. (The university was coed until 1909, then established a separate facility for women, which lasted until 1955.) As Montgomery's interest in education for women was not limited to the US, she also raised funds for missionaries in Asia to start Christian colleges for women, particularly in China. Her national speaking tour in 1910-1911 raised $1 million for this purpose. (See below under \\"Christian missions\\".) Bible translation Montgomery was the first woman to translate the New Testament into English from Greek and have it published by a professional publishing house. (Julia E. Smith published her translation privately, paying for it herself.) Montgomery was inspired to write a new English translation because of her experience teaching street boys in her church, and finding they did not understand the dated language of the King James Version of the Bible. When she used the Weymouth New Testament (1903), they understood it much better but she was still not satisfied. She decided to write her own translation to \\"make it plain\\" for the \\"ordinary\\" reader. It was published in 1924 as The Centenary Translation, issued by the American Baptist Publication Society in celebration of its 100th anniversary. This version has been reprinted as The New Testament in Modern English, with a spine and cover labeled Montgomery New Testament. Hers is the only English translation by a Baptist woman that has been published.Kendal P. Mobley, \\"Helen Barrett Montgomery: a 'Middle-of-the-Road Baptist' Bible translator\\", Baptist History and Heritage, March 2007, at Free Library of Philadelphia, accessed 14 July 2011 Image:Centenary Translation.jpg Montgomery's translation was notable for her practice of inserting chapter and section titles (as seen in photo), a pioneering feature now commonly used in Bibles in many languages. She included interpretations supporting enlarged roles for women in the church, which was influenced by her reading the works of Katharine C. Bushnell, a Methodist missionary.Sharyn Dowd, \\"Helen Barrett Montgomery's 'Centenary Translation of the New Testament', Characteristics and Influences\\", Perspectives in Religious Studies 19/2: 133-150, 1992, at Gods Word to Women, accessed 14 July 2011 (Bushnell's work was rediscovered by theologians in 1975.) Montgomery had reviewed an edition of Bushnell's collection God's Word for Women in 1924, but likely first came across the work when it was published in 1919. Bushnell's influence is seen in Montgomery's translating 1 Cor.11:13-15 as statements rather than questions (as formerly interpreted by others), as illustrated below with comparisons between the New American Standard Bible and the King James Version. In addition, her notes to Rom 16:2 and to I Cor. 14:34 show her \\"familiarity\\" with Bushnell's argument.Dowd, Centenary Translation, Quote: \\"Nevertheless, the wording of Montgomery's notes to Rom 16:2 and to I Cor. 14:34 suggests familiarity with the version of the argument in 'God's Word to Women'.\\" Montgomery: \\"It is fitting that a woman should pray to God with her head unveiled.\\" NASB: \\"Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?\\" KJV: \\"Is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?\\" Christian missions Montgomery supported missions by a variety of activities: her national speaking tour (1910–1911) raised $1 million for the mission fund (worth $23.7 million in 2010).\\"Seven Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount - 1774 to Present\\", Measuring Worth Website, Quote: \\"In 2010, the relative worth of $1.00 from 1911 is: $23.70 using the Consumer Price Index.\\", accessed 14 July 2011 Much of the money was used to establish colleges for women in China. She wrote books to publicize the missions. Her book, Western Women in Eastern Lands (1910), studied the role of women missionaries and women's mission boards overseas. This was a time of extensive Christian missionary activity in East Asia, especially China. In 1913, at the request of the National Federation of Women's Boards of Foreign Missions, Montgomery traveled extensively in East Asia to study conditions of the ecumenical missions and women. Her work, The King's Highway (1915), sold 160,000 copies. She also served as president of the Women's American Baptist Foreign Mission Society (1914–1924). In this capacity, in 1921 she provided a \\"Jubilee\\" gift to the Northern Baptist Convention of more than $450,000, which the women's Foreign Mission Society had raised.

He helped create a Baghdad artist association, called the \\"Survivors' Group\\" following the fall of the Saddam Hussein government in 2003. Life and career Al-Dawiri was born in Iraq. He was a 1993 graduate of Baghdad College of Arts. Bassem Hamad al-Dawiri co-founded an artist association, called the \\"Survivors' Group,\\" following the ouster of Saddam Hussein during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The group has erected a number of statues throughout Baghdad, despite the violence. Al-Dawiri's most famous work came after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. On 9 April 2003, crowds of Iraqis, aided by United States Marines, toppled a massive statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square, located in the heart of Baghdad. Pictures of the destruction of the statue, which depicted Saddam in a suit with his right arm outstretched, were aired on news broadcasts worldwide. Iraqis were jubilantly seen hitting the statue with their shoes and throwing garbage at Saddam's likeness. Bassem Hamad al-Dawiri was asked by Iraq's interim authorities to erect a new sculpture in Firdos Square less than one month after the destruction of the Saddam statue. Al-Dawiri and a group of artists whom he asked to work with him on the project, created a new modernist sculpture on the site of the old Saddam statue. Al-Dawiri's new sculpture depicts branches reaching towards the Iraqi sky with a ball balancing on a crescent moon. The sculpture is meant to symbolize the unity of Iraq's three main groups – Shias, Sunnis and Kurds. Critics have charged that the sculpture is meaningless considering the sectarian violence which has engulfed Baghdad and Iraq since 2003. Al-Dawari also created a memorial statue dedicated to 18 Iraqi children killed in a suicide car blast in 2005. The statue, which was located in a poor Shia neighborhood called New Baghdad in the eastern part of the city, was destroyed by explosives only months after its creation. Death Bassem Hamad al-Dawiri was killed in a car accident in the southern Iraqi city of Kut on 19 September 2007. Kut is located approximately 100 miles from Baghdad. Al-Dawiri was driving to visit relatives when one of his tires blew out causing his car to overturn. He was 34 years old and was survived by his wife, who was expecting the couple's first child. His death was reported by the Association of Iraqi Artists, of which he was a member.

Assigned to Mine Division (MinDiv) 84, she conducted her first eastern Atlantic-Mediterranean deployment in the fall of 1956. The four-month deployment was followed by a return to minesweeping exercises in the Caribbean and off the Carolina and Florida coasts.  Assigned various duties  Biennially deployed to the Mediterranean for duty with the U.S. 6th Fleet from that time until 1967, she was employed on projects for the Naval Mine Warfare School at Charleston, the Mine Defense Laboratory at Panama City, Florida, and the Naval Ordnance Test Facility at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, during her U.S. 2d Fleet duty. Occasionally assigned to planeguard duty for helicopters from amphibious assault ships, target towing, and to patrol duties, she was also a unit of the Project Mercury recovery force in January 1962 and participated in the recovery effort of the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash.Melson, June 1967, p.31  Her last 6th Fleet tour of duty  In January 1968, Sagacity steamed east for her last tour with the U.S. 6th Fleet, spending most of her time in the western Mediterranean. She returned to Charleston in June; and, until March 1970, operated off the U.S. East Coast.  Grounding in Charleston harbor  In March 1970, she grounded at the entrance to Charleston harbor, causing extensive damage to her rudders, shafts, screws, keel, and hull.  Inactivation and decommissioning  Five months later, as the Navy continued its force level reduction, Sagacity was ordered inactivated. She was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list on 1 October 1970. In 1971, she was sold for scrapping.

Its pipes (often five in number) are made of bamboo and it has free reeds that may be made of bamboo or metal. In China, gourd mouth organs are referred to by the generic name hulusheng (葫芦笙; pinyin: húlúshēng; literally \\"gourd sheng\\"). They are used as folk instruments by ethnic minorities such as the Lahu, Lisu, Akha, and Naxi, who have their own names for the instrument in their own languages; the instrument varies in construction and playing technique from ethnic group to ethnic group. It is found most frequently in China's southwestern province of Yunnan as well as in several other provinces of southern China. Similar instruments are found in Thailand (where it is called naw among the Lahu, lachi among the Akha, and fulu among the Lisu), Cambodia (called the ploy), Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Vietnam (where it is called đing nǎm or m'buot), and Borneo.

Generative work (1970s)  Natural Generative Phonology = In the early and mid-70's, Bybee proposed that the connection between the abstract phonological representation of a word and the actual forms experienced by language users was a more direct one than previously postulated. Her theory of Natural Generative Phonology, elaborated upon and expanded the work of Theo Vennemann, proposing less abstract mental representations of sound structure while arguing for greater proximity between phonetic and phonological forms. Although belonging to a formalist tradition, Bybee's early work already contained elements that challenged the performance/competence model that underlay all Generative assumptions. Natural Generative Phonology proposed that the mental representation of language results from speakers’ exposure to actual language in use. The proposal that the structure of language derives from actual communication rather than from abstract rules wired in the brain represented a major departure from the mainstream linguistics, an idea Bybee pursued in all her subsequent work.  Morphology  In 1985, Bybee published her influential volume Morphology: A study of the Relation between Meaning and Form, in which she uncovered semantic regularities across 50 genetically and geographically diverse languages. These meaning similarities manifest themselves in recurring cross- linguistic patterns in morphological systems with respect to tense, aspect and mood. This work runs counter to Chomskyan generative theory, which describes grammar as an independent module of the brain that works in an abstract manner completely detached from semantic considerations.  Cognitive linguistics  Alongside linguists Dan Slobin and Carol Moder, Bybee's work helped popularize the concept of mental schemas (or schemata) to explain grammatical structure, especially in terms of connections between morphological forms within a paradigm. Bybee defines schemas as \\"an emergent generalization over words having similar patterns of semantic and phonological connections\\". For instance, the English irregular verbs snuck, struck, strung, spun and hung are connected through a schema that builds on similarities between these verbs and across the lexicon: the meaning of past tense, the vowel [ʌ], the final nasal and/or (sequence of) velar consonants, as well as the initial fricative consonant /s/ or /h/. Connections between individual forms and schemas exist in a network (see below) whose links can be strengthened, weakened and at times also severed or created. According to Bybee, the force that binds the links in a network is actual language usage. = The Network Model = Informed by studies child language development, morphological change and psycholinguistic experimentation, Bybee proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s a model to account for the cognitive representation of morphologically complex words: the Network Model. Words entered in the lexicon have varying degrees of lexical strength, due primarily to their token frequency. Words with high lexical strength are easy to access, serve as the bases of morphological relations and exhibit an autonomy that makes them resistant to change and prone to semantic independence.  Grammaticalization  Diachronic studies figure prominently in Bybee's body of work. Specifically, her work has explored the ways in which grammar emerges through language use via grammaticalization. Grammaticalization describes the concept that individual words or constructions may come to express abstract grammatical meaning (e.g. future tense) as users increasingly pair frequent words with a given meaning.

The byway unifies the interconnected waterway of the upper Hudson River, Champlain Canal, Lake George, and Lake Champlain; this waterway is the core of North America’s first \\"super-highway\\" between upstate New York and the Canadian province of Quebec. The initiatives of the Lakes to Locks Passage aim to unify the byway corridor as a single destination. The US portion of the passage is a New York State Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway, and an All-American Road. The Canadian portion is a tourist route by the Quebec Ministry of Tourism. Route description The byway extends from just north of Albany to the vicinity of the Canada–US border at Rouses Point as a highway and as a waterway. The waterway route continues north into Canada to connect with the St. Lawrence River. The distinctive influence of French, English and Dutch settlers is still evident today in the communities along the rivers, waterfalls and lakeshore harbors. A series of 32 Waypoint Communities have been designated to \\"meet and greet\\" the Lakes to Locks Passage visitor. Community museums and attractions serve as Lakes to Locks Passage Heritage Centers. Nearly every community has a driving, biking or walking tour. Highway NY 9B near Rouse Point Northern terminus in the United States The Lakes to Locks Passage route extends from the junction of U.S. Route 4 (US 4) and New York State Route 32 (NY 32) in Waterford, located north of Albany, to the intersection of US 11 and NY 9B in Rouses Point, a village adjacent to the Canada–US border. * US 4 from Waterford (mi. 14.33) to Whitehall (mi. 73.19) * NY 22 from Whitehall (mi. 218.2) to Keeseville (mi. 298.82) * US 9 from Keeseville (mi. 288.79) to Chazy (mi. 320.08) * NY 9B from Chazy (mi. 0.0) to Rouses Point (mi. 5.7) The route also contains lakeside roads both on Point Au Roche and Cumberland Head, featured as \\"Scenic Byways.\\" A border crossing between Rouses Point, New York, and Lacolle, Quebec, is operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Canada Border Services Agency respectively, allowing traffic to continue between the Lakes to Locks Passage and the .

This branch mostly follows Route 223, with deviations through the historical centres of Vieux-Saint-Jean and Chambly. * The eastern branch crosses the Jean-Jacques-Bertrand Bridge then follows Routes 225 and 133 through Henryville, Sainte-Anne-de-Sabrevois, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, the town of Richelieu, Saint-Mathias, Otterburn Park, Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Saint- Charles-sur-Richelieu, Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu, Saint-Ours and Sainte- Victoire-de-Sorel. Most of the eastern branch coincides with the , named for the Richelieu valley's role during the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837-38. Bridges crossing the Richelieu in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, between Chambly and Richelieu, and between Beloeil and Mont-Saint-Hilaire, allow tourists to drive between branches. Both branches meet again at the northern terminus, at the Sorel‑Tracy Heritage Interpretation Centre on the bank of the Saint Lawrence River. Waterway The waterway route extends from the Erie Canal (Mohawk River) at Cohoes, north of Albany and southwest of Waterford, to the St. Lawrence River at Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, northeast of Montreal, Quebec. This waterway was North America's first inter-connected waterway that shaped the nation-building activities of the United States and Canada. It provides access to over of diverse historic, natural, cultural and recreational sites along the Champlain Canal, upper Hudson River, Lake George, and Lake Champlain in New York, and the Chambly Canal and Richelieu River in Quebec. * Champlain Canal from Cohoes to Whitehall.

In January 2000, the New York communities in Clinton, Essex and Washington counties that surround Lake Champlain completed a Corridor Management Plan (CMP) for the Champlain Trail as part of a plan for Lake Champlain Byways, a partnership with communities in the State of Vermont. Also in early 2000, communities along the Champlain Canal in New York completed a CMP for the Champlain Canal Byway. In May 2000, the New York State Scenic Byways Advisory Board (NYSSBAB) recognized the strong grass-roots planning process and adopted the two plans. In that the NYSSBAB provides statewide coordination of the NYS Byway program, they passed a resolution to recommend the merger of the Champlain Canal Byway and the Champlain Trail to form one management organization for a single Byway. The Lakes to Locks Passage was recognized as an All-American Road by the United States Department of Transportation in 2002 for the byway's historic and recreational assets. As an All-American Road, Lakes to Locks Passage is one of a select group of roadways in the country that the Federal Highway Administration promotes as a \\"premier destination\\" in their marketing efforts for national and international tourism. The byway is managed by Lakes to Locks Passage, Inc. a non-profit organization dedicated to building the appreciation, recognition, stewardship and revitalization of the natural, cultural, recreational and historic assets of the communities along the interconnected waterway of the upper Hudson River, Champlain Canal, Lake George, and Lake Champlain. At the 2005 Quebec-New York Economic Summit, Lakes to Locks Passage Inc. and the Regional Conference of Elected Officers (CRÉ) of the Montérégie-Est region sign a memorandum of understanding to \\"jointly promote the region and to develop suggested routes for travelers to follow in the Quebec-New York Corridor region.\\" On the Quebec side, a project for a tourist route along the Richelieu had been discussed since the mid-1990s.

During World War II, he was Army Chief of Staff of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH), from June 1941 until August 1942, when he resigned his commission purportedly in protest of the atrocities committed by the Ustaše Militia. Laxa was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Army on 18 August 1890.Oberst Vladimir Laxa During the First World War he was commander of the 18th Mountain Brigade, and was one of only 131 men The Austro-Hungarian Military Maria Theresia Order 1914–1918 who were awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa, the highest Habsburg decoration; in Laxa's case for the “heroism, enormous bravery, and tenaciously successful defence of positions” by himself and his men on Škabrijel (Italian: Mount Saint Gabriel) during the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo in 1917. After the war ended, he joined the newly formed army of (what became known later as) the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia commenced on 6 April 1941, leading to the proclamation of the Independent State of Croatia on 10 April. Laxa was initially the Army second in command (April–June 1941) and then chief-of-staff. During the war he was awarded the state's Order of the Crown of King Zvonimir. In October 1941 he was transferred to the NDH High Command. He took part in a conference in Opatija (2–3 March 1942) that planned the Third anti-partisan offensive, codenamed ‘Trio’. He remained in the NDH high command until August 1942 when he resigned (although there is a source that claims that Laxa was \\"removed by order of Marshal Slavko Kvaternik and retired\\") due to his protestations about atrocities committed by Ustaše irregulars. Laxa was among the exodus that were forcibly returned to the Partisans at Bleiburg.

Murder on Salisbury Road (Charlotte, NC: Jostens), 2007, pg. 11 on July 17, 1988. Hayes shot nine people, killing four of them; his subsequent successful use of the insanity defense in courts created a statewide controversy in the early 1990s. Background Michael Hayes was born in Winston-Salem in Forsyth County, North Carolina where he was raised. After beginning to use drugs at age 13, Hayes became known for bullying and self- aggrandizing behavior, fueled by probable mental illness and drug abuse.Nicholson, Murder on Salisbury Road After bouncing from job to job, Hayes began to work at a business purchased by his parents. The business, Edwards' Moped Shop, was located on Old Salisbury Road in southern Forsyth County, near the Davidson County line. After stealing funds from the business for a number of months, Hayes' parents threatened to sell the business and stop supporting him, an idea that helped to fuel Hayes' break with reality. Shooting After exhibiting unstable behavior for a few weeks, and following police reports of concern over his behavior, Michael Hayes shot nine passersby from the centerline of the darkened road in front of his parents' moped shop on the night of July 17, 1988. Four of those who were shot, Crystal Cantrell, Tom Nicholson, Melinda Hayes, and Ronnie Hull, died. Complicating matters, the moped shop sat near the Forsyth and Davidson County lines, leading to confusion as to which law enforcement agency had jurisdiction. Hayes later testified for his actions by claiming that he believed the passersby were demons that needed to be killed. Trial, verdict and aftermath Hayes' trial began in Forsyth County on March 27, 1989. The scene became a media circus, resulting in difficulties in trying to seat an impartial jury. After several weeks of testimony, Hayes' defense attorneys convinced a jury that Hayes was insane at the time of the killings, as he had been diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder, alcohol dependence, cannabis dependence, and a personality disorder with antisocial and narcissistic traits. The jury reached a verdict of \\"Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity.\\" Many in the community and state were outraged. Hayes was committed to the Dorothea Dix State Mental Hospital in Raleigh. At Dix, he was given Haldol, a drug often used to reduce aggression or treat schizophrenia. The psychosis went away, and Hayes went off the drug in 1989. Since then, he has never been on medication for mental illness. Hayes' yearly petitions to be set free are usually met with protest from the victims' families and scrutiny by the media. As a result of the public outrage at the Hayes verdict, the N.C. General Assembly has made a few attempts to change the law regarding verdicts of \\"not guilty by reason of insanity.\\" The most notable attempt came in 1998, when a handful of Republicans, outraged by the news that Hayes had fathered a second child while ostensibly in custody at Dix, attempted to introduce a bill that would change an insanity verdict to \\"guilty but insane.\\" Such a change would allow for incarceration, rather than release, following psychiatric treatment. Hospitalization and release The area of the killings has transformed from rural to suburban, with the addition of shopping centers and subdivisions in the years since. The building that housed the moped shop was demolished in the late 1990s to make way for a construction waste landfill. Attempts to erect a memorial to Hayes' victims near the site have been unsuccessful. In September, 2007, Hayes was again in the media spotlight after it was revealed that Dix Hospital had allowed him to leave the hospital to work at a Raleigh-area gas station. The gas station fired Hayes after receiving anonymous threats of firebombing the store or killing Hayes while he was working. At one hearing, numerous psychiatrists who have cared for Hayes testified that Hayes should be released from custody. On September 27, 2007, Hayes was denied release by Judge Steve Balog, despite testimony from numerous psychiatrists as to Hayes' mental stability. On May 13, 2010, Balog signed an order for the conditional release of Hayes. On March 1, 2012, Hayes was completely free for the first time since 1989.

Johann Adolf I, Duke of Saxe- Weissenfels (2 November 1649, in Halle – 24 May 1697, in Weissenfels), was a duke of Saxe-Weissenfels-Querfurt and member of the House of Wettin. He was the first son of Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, and his first wife, Anna Maria of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Accession to the Duchy and continuation of the patronage After the death of his father on 4 June 1680 and the loss of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg (which was secularised by Brandenburg and made over into the Duchy of Magdeburg), Johann Adolf dedicated his first efforts to finishing the still incomplete Schloss Neu-Augustusburg that was begun by his father in 1660; construction at the castle resumed on 18 August 1680. The consecration of the castle chapel took place on 1 November 1682 and the castle was finally paved in the year 1694. A large theatre had been built earlier that sponsored performances of opera in German beginning in 1685. At his estate, near the Guardhouses (Kavaliershaeuser), Johann Adolf created the most important formal garden in central Germany of his time. In 1690 pipes were built to supply the castle complex with water from the Selauer Area. The city of Weissenfels prospered to the point where it became not only an administrative center, but also an economic center. Johann Adolf was a patron of the arts following the model of his father and other members of his family; as court Kapellmeister he appointed Johann Philipp Krieger, who had already served under the late duke. Johann Adolf also discovered the musical talent of the son of his court surgeon Georg Händel and encouraged him to let the young Georg Friedrich seek training in music. Like his father (who had served as its head), Johann Adolf was accepted into the Fruitbearing Society. Controversy over the Barby inheritance When the county of Rosenburg fell to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg in 1659 after the extinction of the male line of the counts of Barby, Johann Adolf's father, duke August, continued to administer these areas (which were not a part of this patrimony) in spite of the protests of the Electors of Brandenburg and Saxony, who desired those lands in accordance with the terms of the Peace of Westphalia. In 1666, the Elector of Saxony finally consented to give Barby and Rosenberg to duke August until the extinction of the Weissenfels line. After the death of the duke, Barby was inherited by one of his younger sons, Heinrich. Johann Adolf, who saw his inheritance reduced by his father, protested. After his father's death, Johann Adolf turned to the elector of Brandenburg to obtain a declaration of nullity for the sales contract that relinquished Rosenberg. In April 1681 it was sold for 60.000 Taler to the Elector Frederick of Brandenburg. Due to the debts accumulated by his father, Johann Adolf was forced in 1687 to sell Burg bei Magdeburg. Dispute with the electorate of Saxony After the death of Elector Johann Georg II of Saxony in 1680, the will of his father Johann Georg I was disputed by the new Elector Johann Georg III with regard to the appanages of his younger sons; he refused to recognise the principalities and collateral lines of his cousins. This brought some difficulties to Johann Adolf after he recognised a threat from the Saxonian Electorate to his own territories. The conflict could only be settled with the Contract of Torgau (12 May 1681) and two other contracts signed in Dresden in 1682 and 1688; with these pacts, Johann Adolf secured his rule over Querfurt and his seat in the Upper-Saxonian Council (Kreistag). On his death, his three surviving sons, Johann Georg, Christian, and Johann Adolf II, successively assumed rulership over the duchy of Saxe-Weissenfels. Marriages and issue In Altenburg on 25 October 1671, Johann Adolf married Johanna Magdalena of Saxe-Altenburg. They had eleven children: #Magdalene Sibylle (b. Halle, 3 September 1673 – d. Eisenach, 28 November 1726), married on 28 July 1708 to Johann Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. #August Frederick (b. Halle, 15 September 1674 – d. Halle, 16 August 1675). #Johann Adolf (b.

Sorau, 16 March 1731), married on 16 June 1705 to Count Erdmann II of Promnitz. #Sophie (b. Weissenfels, 2 August 1684 – d. Rosswald, Silesia, 6 May 1752), married first on 16 October 1699 to Georg Wilhelm, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and secondly on 14 July 1734 to Joseph Albert, Count of Hoditz and Wolframitz. #Johann Adolf II, Duke of Saxe- Weissenfels (b. Weissenfels, 4 September 1685 – d. Leipzig, 16 May 1746). After the death of his wife in 1686, Johann Adolf married a second time in Querfurt on 3 February 1692 to Christiane Wilhelmine of Bünau. This marriage was morganatic and only made by contract; the completion of the marriage in the presence of a clergyman was left to his discretion. Johann Adolf give her 6,000 Taler as Morgengabe and an annual income of 3,000 Taler and the use of Schloss Dahme for her residence as dower. He admonished his sons to show her due respect, and should any children come from this marriage he would make further divisions over the family lands. After five years of marriage, Christiane Wilhelmine was created Imperial Countess (Reichgräfin) in 1697 at the request of her husband. They had no children.Morganatic and Unequal Marriages in German Law References Category:1649 births Category:1697 deaths Category:House of Saxe-Weissenfels Category:People from Halle (Saale) Category:Dukes of Saxe-Weissenfels Category:Albertine branch ","title":"Johann Adolf I, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels"},{"id":"13438719","text":"Ian Redpath (born 12 September 1965) is a former English first-class cricketer, who had a brief county career with Essex and Derbyshire in the late 1980s.

Helmi Dagmar Juvonen (1903–1985) was an American artist active in Seattle, Washington. Although she worked in a wide variety of media, she is best known for her prints, paintings, and drawings. She is associated with the artists of the Northwest School. Background Helmi Dagmar Juvonen was born in Butte, Montana on January 17, 1903, the second daughter of Finnish immigrants (Helmi is Finnish for Pearl). When she was 15, her family moved to Seattle, Washington. She attended Queen Anne High School, and after graduating, worked various art and design-related jobs while studying illustration, portraiture, and life drawing with private teachers. In 1929 she received a scholarship to Cornish College of the Arts, where she studied illustration with Walter Reese, puppetry with Richard Odlin, and lithography with Emilio Amero.Wehr, Wesley; The Eighth Lively Art: Conversations with Painters, Poets, Musicians, and the Wicked Witch of the West, University of Washington Press, 2000; / 9780295802572 Career After finishing her studies at Cornish, Juvonen struggled to make a living in the midst of the Great Depression. She did portraits for well-to-do friends, designed greeting cards, made rag dolls and puppets, illustrated newspaper articles, did department store window displays, and made ceramic keepsakes for gift shops, while pursuing creative art, and occasionally selling or receiving a prize for an original piece. In 1930 she was first diagnosed with manic depression, and spent three years in Northern State Hospital in Sedro-Woolley, Washington. An avid reader, Juvonen's favorite subjects were the mythologies and spiritual practices of people around the world. While doing drawings of the Seattle Potlatch festival for a newspaper in 1934, Helmi met Chief Shelton of the Lummi Tribe, and soon after, Chief Colowash of the Yakima tribe, Charlie Swan of the Makah, and White Eagle of the Chippewa. This was the beginning of a lifelong interest in native art and culture. She was eventually invited to attend special ceremonies, some of which were rarely witnessed by outsiders. These experiences had a profound influence on her artwork. Actively engaged with the burgeoning Seattle art community, Juvonen made and fostered friendships with a number of prominent artists and collectors including Seattle Art Museum founder Dr. Richard Fuller, sculptor Dudley Pratt, and painter Mark Tobey, with whom she developed a near-legendary obsession that became a frequent subject of her art. Like many artists during the Great Depression, Juvonen participated in Federal Art Project programs. Hired by the FAP's Washington State Director Bruce Inverarity, in the spring of 1938 she made sketches of Hooverville, the large unemployed encampment south of downtown Seattle; in 1940, she and other women artists of the FAP created hooked rugs for ski lodges in floral and Native American designs. She also helped create dioramas of tribal life for the University of Washington Museum (later known as the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture). During the Second World War Juvonen worked for the Boeing company, doing technical drawings. Around this time she also spent several months in Seattle's Harborview hospital. When she could, she continued to attend and sketch regional Indian ceremonies, often spending weeks at a time on the reservations. She recorded the tribal dances of the Lummi- Swinomish on the La Conner Reservation during the winter of 1945, and in 1946 she spent a week with the Yakima sketching their ceremonies. In 1947 she stayed on Vancouver Island for several months and was allowed to attend the initiation ceremony of a secret society. She spent a week at Neah Bay in August 1951, sketching Makah Indian dances, costumes, and artifacts, and attended ceremonial dances at a gathering of many different tribes at La Conner in 1953. She also did hundreds of drawings of Native American artifacts in the Washington State History Museum. By the early 1950s Juvonen was a well- known artist in the Pacific Northwest. Works of hers had been displayed in local galleries, and several were in the collection of the Seattle Art Museum; however, she still had very little money. Her small house overlooking West Seattle's Beach Drive, which she had purchased in 1937, became increasingly dilapidated. Although she remained friends with Mark Tobey and his partner Pehr Hallsten, her obsession with Tobey at times contributed to serious questioning of her health, and she was institutionalized for several months in 1952 and 53.Guide to the Helmi Juvonen Papers, 1934–1986; University of Washington Libraries Special Collections.http://nwda.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv25660 retvd 6 5 14 With her house rendered uninhabitable by vandals in her absence, Juvonen spent the next couple of years living among artist friends in Seattle's bustling University District, where she worked in a children's nursery and sold original prints from the front of a frame shop. During this time Tobey occasionally let her use his studio, but her obsession with him became so troublesome that he eventually considered taking legal action against her. In 1956 Juvonen, who was supporting herself by selling prints from a stall in the Pike Place Market, moved into a small house in Edmonds, Washington. The shack- like house was soon overrun with cats and chickens, and neighbors complained frequently. In 1959, she was committed to Northern State Hospital in Sedro- Woolley, Washington. After one year of confinement there, she was transferred to Oakhurst Infirmary (later known as Oakhurst Convalescent Center) in Elma, Washington, where she spent the rest of her life. In spite of her surroundings, Juvonen tirelessly continued to produce art, using whatever materials she was able to secure. Artistic practice Juvonen's largest works from the late 1940s through the 1960s are organized laterally and characterized by shallow indeterminate space and \\"all-overness\\". She valued and practiced conventional techniques of three- dimensional illusionism through the 1950s; she also developed a range of strategies much closer to graffiti and cartoons. A light or white delineation on a darker ground, which frequently appears in her works, suggests chalk on a blackboard, and vernacular references in her work are commonly associated with the \\"white writing\\" identified with Mark Tobey and Morris Graves. Juvonen introduces into her work words and phrases, a variety of human figures and faces, architectural elements, and religious and eclectic symbols from diverse cultures. Later years In her twenty-five years at Oakhurst, Juvonen often expressed hope of being released, but wrote torrents of letters to friends and strangers which appeared to indicate a deteriorating mental state. Her obsession with Mark Tobey continued. She referred to him as \\"Papa Moth\\" and fantasized that he was going to rescue her from the infirmary, marry her, and have children with her, although Tobey was gay and she was past child-bearing age. Fellow artists and friends such as Wesley Wehr, Morris Graves, Neil Meitzler, Tom Kaasa, and Brent Goeres preserved and stored her artwork, visited and wrote her in Elma, took her on day trips, and organized occasional small gallery exhibits. Authorities at Oakhurst allowed her to keep a large number of cats. During the final years of her life there was a surge of interest in Juvonen's work. In 1975, curators Betty Bowen and Anne Gould Hauberg organized an exhibition at the Pacific Northwest Arts Center Gallery, in Seattle's Pioneer Square. The success of this show led to Wesley Wehr guest-curating an exhibition of her work at the Frye Art Museum in November 1976. This was followed by a Helmi show at the Burke Museum in Seattle in 1982, and, in 1984, shows at the Nordic Heritage Museum in Seattle, and at the Evergreen State College Gallery and the Washington State Capital Museum, both in Olympia.Ament, Deloris Tarzan; Iridescent Light: The Emergence of Northwest Art (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002) She was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Whatcom Museum of History and Art, in Bellingham, in 1985.

Upon completion of the Rother Navigation, the Earl of Egremont used his estate workforce to build the 1¼ mile long canal from just upstream of the Shopham Cut to Haslingbourne, with two locks, each with a rise of 8 feet and 6 inches. The Haslingbourne Stream was diverted to provide the water supply, and still flows in the canal bed from Haslingbourne to the site of Haines Lock. The initial intention was to extend the canal through the Shimmings Valley to Hamper's Green on the north side of Petworth, then northwards to join the Wey Navigation at Shalford. Legal authority Construction of the branch to Haslingbourne bridge was included in the Act of Parliament,Act of Parliament [2151] of 1791 numbered [2151] passed in 1791, titled; > \\"An Act to enable the Earl of Egremont to make and maintain the River Rother > navigable, from the Town of Midhurst, to a certain Meadow, called the Railed > Pieces, or Stopham Meadow in the Parish of Stopham, and a navigable Cut, > from the said River to the River Arun, at or near Stopham Bridge, in the > county of Sussex; and for other Purposes.\\" Construction Digging began early in 1795, employing about twenty navvies. In August lock gates were being hung and a bridge built at Haines Lock. Sandstone from the nearest quarries at Fittleworth and Upperton would have been used for the bridges and locks. Coping stones are recorded as being barged from Todham and Moorland locks near Midhurst by Edmund Sayer. The navigation was open by October 1795. Plans for extension The Earl of Egremont wanted a safe inland waterway that would link London on the River Thames with the south coast and the naval base at Portsmouth. Coastal shipping at that time faced serious hazards such as the notorious Goodwin Sands, where the Earl's own two-year-old brigantine Egremont was wrecked in 1797. During wars with France there were military dangers as well. The initial intention was to extend the canal through the Shimmings Valley to Hamper's Green on the north side of Petworth, then northwards to join the Wey Navigation at Shalford.P A L Vine, London's Lost Route to Midhurst The Earl of Egremont's Navigation pp 64-67 Canal engineer William Jessop believed a route could be found past Northchapel, Shillinglee, Dunsfold and Alfold, then following the Cranleigh stream through Bramley to Shalford. A branch from Alfold to Horsham was also proposed. Agriculturalist Arthur Young advocated the scheme as a means to bring lime for the farms to improve their productivity. The Earl's estate surveyor Thomas Upton carried out a more detailed survey in 1793 and concluded that the 32 mile route would rise some 220 feet to cross the watershed into Surrey, with as many as nine locks needed just to climb 58 feet to the north side of Petworth. He suggested that a 17-mile extension of the Arun Navigation from Newbridge to the River Wey would be more practical. Even in that year when Canal Mania was at its height it was apparent that extension of the Petworth Canal could not be cost effective. Trade The main products carried on the canal were chalk, coal and timber. Coal from Newcastle or South Wales was transferred from coastal ships into barges at Arundel. Chalk was barged up the River Arun from pits leased and operated by the Earl at Houghton and Amberley. Timber and all kinds of timber products, including charcoal and oak bark for tanning were barged out from the Peworth area, although there are few records of what passed through Haslingbourne. A lime kiln was operated at Haslingbourne wharf,P A L Vine, London's Lost Route to Midhurst The Earl of Egremont's Navigation p 73 and some lime barged down the canal. Most of the Petworth trade however went to Coultershaw wharf on the Rother navigation, which was further away from the town but was on the well maintained turnpike road to Chichester. There was no extra toll for using the Petworth canal but this also saved the barge masters having to travel through two locks. From east of Petworth it was often cheaper to cart goods to and from the River Arun, which was free of tolls below Pallingham, avoiding the Rother Navigation tolls payable on passing through Stopham Lock. Closure Dredging was carried out in 1824 and the banks repaired,P A L Vine, London's Lost Route to Midhurst The Earl of Egremont's Navigation p 73 but when repairs to locks on the Rother navigation were urgently needed in 1826 the Earl decided to close the underused canal and reuse materials from the locks, which were completely dismantled that summer. This paid no regard to the landowner's legal duty to maintain the navigation. The cutting across the field below Haines Lock was then filled in. The canal today The canal channel on the Rother floodplain The wharf at Haslingbourne has entirely disappeared and an electricity sub- station and a former water treatment plant, which pumped water from springs at the foot of Gore Hill to Petworth, are on the site. The area is now used for storage of construction machinery. Below Haslingbourne Cottages the stream flows in the canal bed which is cut through sandstone beds, creating a shaded artificial gorge rich in mosses and lichens. Emerging from this cutting at the site of Upper Lock the canal follows a straight course across low lying boggy ground, fenced off as a nature reserve area. Reaching the site of Haines Lock the stream can be heard pouring through a broken down weir in the undergrowth as it turns eastward into its natural course. The west bank of the canal here runs into the pasture for some twenty metres and the position of the levelled course beyond can just be discerned. Beyond the slightly higher ground here, as the Haslingbourne Stream again comes close to the canal, the embankments can be seen forming a straight line across the floodplain to the river. A pond near the river is the site of a weir and tumblebay.

The 151-page (192 pages in paperback, first edition) book covers some social issues of the 1960s and 1970s. It was published by Doubleday and Co. An unabridged audiobook recording of the novel was released in 2005 by Books on Tape and read by Scott Brick. Plot Six emotionally disturbed teenaged boys are sent from their homes throughout the United States by their affluent parents to Box Canyon Boys Camp near Prescott, Arizona, as the camp's slogan was \\"Send us a boy – we'll send you a cowboy\\", and the parents hoped that the camp would mature the boys. Each having originally been assigned to one of the six cabins, they are quickly outcast by the other campers, and find themselves together in one cabin. After a contest between the six cabins sorts out the pecking order, their cabin naturally lands in last place. The boys, in accordance with the camp rules, do manage to raid all of the superior cabins and conquer the trophies of the higher-ranking cabins to advance in rank, but they use badly executed subterfuge that is looked down upon by the other campers. Five of the six cabins were named after various Native American tribes and awarded mounted animal heads corresponding to each of the cabins' ranks, which are, from highest to lowest ranks: *Apache – bull buffalo *Sioux – mountain lion *Comanches – black bear *Cheyenne – bobcat *Navajo – pronghorn *Bedwetters – chamberpot All of the Bedwetters refer to each other by last names in the book and movie, including the two Lally brothers, who are referred to as Lally 1 and Lally 2, although their first names are mentioned in the book. An unpleasant confrontation between the boys and their counselor, resulting from an attempted molestation by the counselor to the youngest of the boys, ends with Teft breaking into their counselor's footlocker, and because of the whiskey, beer, cigarettes, and pornography found in the footlocker, they blackmail the counselor, who is called \\"Wheaties\\", into taking them to a ranch where they witness a canned hunt of surplus bison that had been rounded up from the surrounding area. The hunters (who won their spots at that hunt by lottery) sat or stood along a fence, while shooting at the fenced-in, nearly tame bison. When the boys return, disgusted at the slaughter, they decide to break out of camp that night to stop the canned hunt. They ride horses into town, where Teft hot-wires an old truck. After a ride into Flagstaff, Arizona, on U.S. Route 66, they enter an all-night eatery to get food, but are accosted by two \\"redneck\\" types, who follow the boys away from the restaurant and force them over, where they discover that the truck is hot-wired. Teft pulls a .22-caliber rifle from the back of the truck and shoots out a tire on the car driven by the men harassing the boys, then orders the men to start walking or they can \\"wear earrings\\". Cotton and the other boys climb back into the truck and continue their journey to the ranch, but run out of gas just before reaching their destination. They walk the rest of the way and make their way through the fence maze on the ranch until they get the exit gate open, so the bison can escape. However, the bison are content and have no intention of escaping, until Teft hot-wires a state-owned truck and Cotton drives into the herd of buffalo while blowing the truck's horn, which alerts the hunters who are camped out nearby. Cotton drives the truck through the herd of buffalo and over the edge of the Mogollon Rim to his death, which ends the book as the hunters surround the other boys.

Fioravanti appeared in films and television from a young age, and in his early teens was the most famous child in Italy. He and Mambro were fugitives wanted for terrorist offences by their early twenties, they spent a further period on the run as suspects in the Bologna bombing. Both were captured after gunfights with police. Although Fioravanti, Mambro and a third NAR member were convicted of the bombing, there were those who thought that a higher level of the conspiracy was never uncovered. Fioravanti and Mambro admit involvement in terrorist murders, but have consistently denied having any part of the Bologna station massacre. Biography=Background Valerio Fioravanti in The Reward's Yours... The Man's Mine Fioravanti was born in Rovereto to a Roman family, his father was a television presenter. As a child actor, Fioravanti starred in a popular series of the 1960s, \\"La famiglia Benvenuti\\", with Enrico Maria Salerno and Valeria Valeri playing his parents. Fioravanti's younger brother Cristiano had joined a far right youth section aged 13; he acquired a reputation for relishing violent confrontations with leftists. According to Fioravanti, his original motivation for associating with far right militants was not political, but a desire to protect his brother. Fioravanti's parents tried get him away from the escalating violence by sending him to study in the US for a year, he returned to make his last film, which was released in 1975. In early 1977 he was charged with assault, and given 40 days in jail for possession of a pistol. Fioravanti abandoned university studies to join a paratroop unit of the Italian army; he was repeatedly punished for disciplinary infractions. After a crate of hand grenades was stolen while he was on guard duty, Fioravanti was court martialed for leaving his post and sentenced to several months in a military prison. Francesca Mambro was the daughter of a policeman (who died in 1979), and from a relatively modest background. She met Fioravanti at a far right university club. As activists for the Italian Social Movement they were targeted by political opponents as fascists (Fioravanti himself rejected the label). In a 1997 interview, Mambro said she identified with far right wing youth as underdogs who tended to be on the receiving end of violence. Some of her friends died, including a young Social Movement protester who Mambro saw being shot dead by a Carabinieri captain during disturbances that followed the Acca Larentia killings.Orton, M (1998) ‘Demonsterizing the Myth of the Terrorist Woman: Faranda, Braghetti, and Mambro’ Annali d’italianistica, Vol. 16:281-96. The incident alienated Fioravanti's associates, and led to riots during which some Italian Social Movement youths shot at police. Mambro later said the experience made her decide to carry a gun, although her personal involvement with Fioravanti played a major part in her taking up terrorism.The accidental terrorist, Independent, 6 May 1997 Armed Revolutionary Nuclei It is believed that at some point Mambro devised the name Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari, but the group was anti-authoritarian and was never formally structured. =Ideology= The late seventies were a time of political violence in the form of bombings, assassinations, and street warfare between rival militant factions. Fioravanti was one of a number of teenage activists in Rome who saw the state-sanctioned far-right political party as betraying them, though inaction in the face of attacks by political opponents and the police. Influenced by leftist movements, a large group of far right youths, including Fioravanti and his close associates, moved from street-fighting to terrorism. Unlike their left-wing counterparts, they emphasised personal qualities like spontaneity and willingness to fight, even in a lost cause, over political objectives. Fioravanti has said, \\"About defeat we never cared, we are a generation of losers, always on the side of the defeated.\\"Threats to Democracy: The Radical Right in Italy After the War, Franco Ferraresi, p. 192 Italy was seen as a 'sick', unjust and repressive state. In a 2005 interview, Fioravanti characterized this former rationale for terrorist activities as 'total stupidity', and said 'exultation and rage' in his milieu had fed a collective delusion.ITALIAN NEOFASCISM. The Strategy of Tension and the Politics of Nonreconciliation, Anna Cento Bull, p148-9. =Personnel= The original core members consisted of those close to Fioravanti: Franco Anselmi, magistrate's son Alessandro Alibrandi and Fioravanti's brother Cristiano. Two of the most active terrorists, Gilberto Cavallini, who was a fugitive, and 17-year-old Luigi Ciavardini, became part of the core group after the first armed actions. Others were the part-Eritrean George Vale and Massimo Carminati (later to become a major figure in the Italian underworld). Mambro became active in NAR violence and romantically involved with Fioravanti during 1979. Testimony at their trial described the couple as \\"always together\\".Rome the Second Time: 15 Itineraries That Don't Go to the Coliseum, By Dianne Bennett, William Graebner Fioravanti was a good friend of Carminati, and through him he was introduced to some members of Rome's dominant criminal gang members, including Massimo Sparti, who became close to Cristiano. Their anti- hierarchical ethos precluded any formal leader, though Fioravanti was the main organizer. He anticipated others would be drawn to emulate NAR, and that other cells would spring up spontaneously, as they shifted to taking action irrespective of the consequences;. Fioravanti advocated small, fast moving groups, as he intended the name \\"Armed Revolutionary Nuclei\\" to be adopted by largely independent cells. =Armed violence= Fioravanti was doing military service when the first killing occurred, it is believed to have been committed by either Cristiano or Alibrandi in September 1977; a leftist militant was shot dead. The victims of Armed Revolutionary Nuclei that followed included several policemen (this was justified on the grounds of them being 'thugs and torturers'), comrades suspected of treachery, and investigating magistrates including Mario Amato. Fioravanti was 23, and Mambro 21, when warrants charged them with the Bologna massacre bombing of 2 August 1980, which killed 85 people and both Fioravanti and Mambro were subsequently convicted of. Capture In February 1981, police surprised members of Armed Revolutionary Nuclei as they were retrieving weapons cached in the Bacchiglione river on the outskirts of Padua. In the shooting that followed, two policemen were killed and Fioravanti was badly wounded in the legs; he was arrested later the same day. His brother Cristiano was tracked down two months later through telegrams he had sent his girlfriend. He quickly collaborated to provide police with a thorough account of NAR activities, and was released under a new identity after a year. The remaining group of NAR fugitives did not regard Mambro as a leader, she played a traditional female role by trying to keep life serene.Women and terrorism - Page 55 In March 1982, she was shot and critically wounded while taking part in a bank robbery during which a bystander was killed. According to Mambro, accomplices had openly toyed with the idea of coup de grâce rather than letting the police capture and interrogate her, but it was eventually decided to leave her at a hospital, where she was arrested Bologna massacre investigation The bombing was quickly attributed to neofascists by the authorities; in late August 1980, the prosecutor of Bologna had ordered the arrest of 28 people on charges of subversive association, including Fioravanti (who was already a fugitive with Mambro) and far right ideologue Stefano Delle Chiaie and his associate Pierluigi Pagliai who were in Bolivia.The Nazi Legacy: Klaus Barbie and the International Fascist Connection, by Magnus Linklater and Isabel Hilton and Neal Ascherson. Pagliai was fatally wounded during an attempt to bring him back to Italy.The Devil's Agent: Life, Times and Crimes of Nazi Klaus BarbieKlaus Barbie: The Butcher of Lyons, by Tom Bower Propaganda Due An informer, later found to be unreliable, claimed that Delle Chiaie was involved in Bologna, and that the bombing had been commissioned by a Masonic lodge made up of Italy's government, media and security services elite. In the aftermath of the bombing, Licio Gelli, of Masonic lodge Propaganda Due, said a conspiracy of far rightists and foreigners had carried it out. On 13 January 1981, fabricated evidence, implicating Terza Posizione, along with French and German right-wing extremists, was planted on a train;René Monzat, Enquêtes sur la droite extrême, Le Monde-éditions, 1992, p.89 General Pietro Musumeci of SISMI was later charged with ordering the deception. Gelli was charged with slandering the investigation into the massacre; some suspected he was deeply involved in the bombing itself. Further complicating police enquiries were allegations that Fioravanti had carried out killings for Propaganda Due.Puppetmasters: The Political Use of Terrorism in Italy, p. 301 Strategy of tension Bologna was a prosperous stronghold of the Communist Party; it had suffered prior terrorist attacks, starting in 1969. A theory thought plausible by Italian of a Left Wing identification posited an alliance of the CIA and Italian Deep State officials concentrated in the P2 Freemasonry lodge, using terrorism in a Strategy of tension to force a 'drift to the right' for 'public safety', and associate the Left parties with chaos in order to nullify their growing popularity. Operation Gladio, a NATO secret project to be activated in the event of a Soviet \\"conquest\\" of Europe came under grave suspicion. Some suspected that explosives used in the Bologna bombing had been taken from Operation Gladio arms caches.Gancer ,D., Nato's Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe, P24 The prosecution at Fiovantini's trial alleged he obtained explosive material by scuba diving on a sunken WW2 Italian warship and taking recovered anti aircraft shells apart to extract the propellant.The terror trail that won't grow cold Independent, 10 OCTOBER 1993 Link to Perugia trial of Andreotti A clandestine weapons store of the Banda della Magliana criminal organization was kept in the basement of a government building, the NAR had access to it, and ammunition thought likely to have come from the joint arms cache was used to kill Carmine Pecorelli in 1979.Puppetmasters: The Political Use of Terrorism in Italy, p. 87-89 In 1993, contemporaneously with his trial for Mafia association in Palermo,The Andreotti Affair: Supergrasses target Andreotti, The Independent, April 16, 1993 former Italian prime minister Giulio Andreotti, along with Fioravanti's mobster friend Massimo Carminati, were charged with the murder of Pecorelli by prosecutors in Perugia.

She also said that Armed Revolutionary Nuclei had never deliberately targeted ordinary people. Fioravanti has said that the 1980 Bologna train station bombing was the work of Libya, and that the Italian state had been reluctant to pursue that line of enquiry because of dependence on Libya's oil, and thus blamed neo-fascists.Italian Neofascism: The Strategy of Tension, P151-152 =Trial= The accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty; the prosecution can appeal against verdicts.

In Italy a whole life term sentence may be considered to have been served after 20 years, if the prisoner shows \\"behaviour such as to provide certain evidence of reform\\".Woman convicted in Red Brigades slayings released early from Rome prison, Associated Press, 19 Dec 2006Fioravanti Walks Free As Conditional Release Ends, Corriere della Sera, 3 Aug 2009 Evidence The trial began in January 1987; there were 20 defendants. For the first time since Fioravanti's arrest he and Mambro were reunited when they were placed together in the cage Italian courtrooms have for those accused of violent crimes. They pleaded guilty to responsibility for numerous murders, but denied they or their group carried out the Bologna massacre. The prosecution said that Fioravanti had admitted to crimes which demonstrated an indiscriminate ruthlessness, and that he had espoused an ideology that justified attacks similar to Bologna, as had Mambro.Weinberg, L., Political Parties and Terrorist Groups P.57 The crucial evidence against Fioravanti and Mambro in the Bologna bombing was given by a witness some thought untrustworthy: small-time criminal and Banda della Magliana member Massimo Sparti.Italy Today: The Sick Man of Europe, 2010, p106 He alleged that, two days after the blast, Fioravanti had come to him to obtain false documents, and said he worried someone might recognize Mambro from the station. The testimony contained inconsistencies; Sparti was released from prison in 1982, ostensibly because of terminal cancer, although he was still alive 15 years later. Fioravanti's alibi for the morning of 2 August was weakened by its lack of precision: he had initially said he was in Treviso, but subsequently asserted he had travelled with Mambro and Ciavardini to a meeting in Padova early that day. Cristiano and another NAR member became prosecution witnesses: both recalled that, days after the bombing, Mambro had worried about being accused of the massacre, spoke of being in Padova at the time of the explosion, and expressed concern about them being believed. Conviction and sentence In July 1988 Fioravanti and Mambro were found guilty of responsibility for the Bologna train bombing, as well as for the crimes they admitted; they were sentenced to ten life terms, plus 250 years. Massimiliano Fachini and Sergio Picciafuoco were also given life sentences for the bombing. Several NAR members were given prison sentences for being members of an illegal armed group. At the same trial,, Gelli and General Pietro Musumeci were convicted of offences not directly related to the massacre. Delle Chiaie was acquitted of subversive association. In 1990, an appeal acquitted all four of those convicted of responsibility for the bombing, but Fioravanti and Mambro were again prosecuted and convicted: in 1995, a final judgement by the Supreme Court confirmed their earlier convictions and sentences. After a series of separate trials, in 2007 Ciavardini was also convicted of responsibility for the Bologna bombing. Protestations of innocence from all three won them a measure of support from a range of politicians, jurists and academics.ITALIAN NEOFASCISM. The Strategy of Tension and the Politics of Nonreconciliation, Anna Cento Bull, p145 Imprisonment Mambro was ostracised in prison. Fellow prisoner Anna Laura Braghetti, serving time for Red Brigades terrorism, was sympathetic and befriended her, later becoming Mambro's cellmate. In 1985 Fioravanti and Mambro were married while serving their sentences. In 1997, the Venice Film Festival debuted a documentary of Fioravanti's on Rome's Rebibbia prison, Piccoli Ergastoli (\\"Little Life Sentences\\"). Release Despite continuing to deny responsibility for the Bologna massacre, both were given day release from the prison. Mambro worked outside at an anti-death penalty organisation from 1998; her daughter with Fioravanti was born two years later, and Mambro was conditionally released in 2002. Fioravanti was given day release from 2000, and conditionally released in 2004. The conditions ended in 2009. Fioravanti and Mambro have repudiated and expressed regret for their admitted terrorist activities,Klopp, C., Sentences: The Memoirs and Letters of Italian Political Prisoners, P198 and continue to maintain they had no involvement in the Bologna station bombing.

In it an investigative reporter, played by Darren McGavin, comes to suspect that a serial killer in the Las Vegas area is actually a vampire. The film was based on the then-unpublished novel by Jeff Rice titled The Kolchak Papers (aka The Kolchak Tapes).Encyclopedia of the Vampire: The Living Dead in Myth, Legend, and Popular Culture Rice said he wrote the novel because, \\"I'd always wanted to write a vampire story, but more because I wanted to write something that involved Las Vegas.\\" Rice had difficulty finding a publisher willing to buy the manuscript until agent Rick Ray read it and realized the novel would make a good movie. The 1973 novel (renamed The Night Stalker) wasn't published until after the TV movie had already aired, and was delayed according to Rice because the publisher wanted both Rice's original novel and the 1974 sequel The Night Strangler (written by Rice but based on the screenplay by author Richard Matheson) so \\"they could be placed on the top of the publisher's list in the 1 and 2 positions for 1974.\\"Satian, Al, and Heather Johnson, \\"The Night Stalker Papers,\\" in Monsters of the Movies Vol. 1, No. 1, (June 1974), p. 16 Directed by John Llewellyn Moxey (a veteran of theatrical and TV movies), adapted by Richard Matheson, and produced by Dan Curtis (best known at the time for Dark Shadows), The Night Stalker became the highest rated original TV movie on US television, earning a 33.2 rating and 48 share. The TV movie did so well it was released overseas as a theatrical movie and inspired a sequel TV movie titled The Night Strangler, which aired in 1973, a single-season TV series of twenty episodes titled Kolchak: The Night Stalker which ran on ABC between 1974 and 1975, and a short lived 2005 TV series called Night Stalker. Actor Darren McGavin recalled that his involvement began when \\"My representatives called to say that ABC had purchased the rights to a book called The Kolchak Papers. They were into a kind of first draft of a script by Richard Matheson, and they called the agency to ask them if I'd be interested in doing it. My representative read it and called me.\\" The popular TV movie, along with its sequel and the TV series, provided the inspiration for Chris Carter's The X-Files. Carter featured actor Darren McGavin in the show as a tribute to the actor and the project that inspired his popular series. Originally Carter had wanted McGavin to play Kolchak, but the actor elected not to, so the role was rewritten, making McGavin's character Arthur Dales the \\"father of the X-files\\".The Night Stalker Companion, by Mark Dawidziak Plot Kolchak, sitting on the bed of a sleazy hotel room, is listening to a replay of his dictation on his portable tape recorder. The notes are about a series of murders that have plagued the Las Vegas Strip, and a cover-up of those events by the authorities. All of the victims had their bodies drained of blood. When a meeting is conducted with the sheriff's department, the FBI, the police, and others, they discover the suspect's true identity is Janos Skorzeny, who is the prime suspect in multiple homicides extending back years, involving massive loss of blood. When Skorzeny attempts to rob a hospital, the police are called to stop him. Skorzeny is shot multiple times without effect, and manages to escape by outrunning a police car and motorcycle. Kolchak's girlfriend, Gail Foster, either a Vegas showgirl or local prostitute (or both), urges him to explore vampire lore. The evidence persuades Kolchak to suspect that Skorzeny is a vampire, much to the disbelief of his boss Anthony \\"Tony\\" Vincenzo. Following yet another failed attempt to capture Skorzeny despite overwhelming police force, the authorities strike a deal with Kolchak to eschew their traditional investigative methods for his vampire-centric approach in exchange for giving him exclusive rights to the story. Acting on a tip, Kolchak locates Skorzeny's safe house and pursues the story on his own, fearful that the police will renege on their deal. Compromised when the vampire returns, Kolchak struggles to escape and is nearly killed by Skorzeny before his friend FBI Agent Bernie Jenks, alerted to Kolchak's presence in the house, arrives and joins the fight. Realizing that dawn has broken, Kolchak and Jenks force a weakened Skorzeny back against a sun-drenched staircase and stake the vampire, just as authorities burst through the front door. Kolchak writes his version of the story for the newspaper and proposes to his girlfriend, telling her that they will both move to New York City. The authorities, however, unwilling to publicly admit that Skorzeny was the vampire Kolchak claimed, print a false version of the newspaper story with his byline and threaten to charge him with first degree murder unless he quietly leaves Las Vegas. They also tell him that his girlfriend Gail has already been forced to leave the city for being \\"an undesirable element.\\" Carl exhausts his savings placing personal advertisements across the country in a futile attempt to find her. The final scene reverts to Kolchak in his sleazy hotel room. He explains that if anyone tries to verify the events in the book they will find that all witnesses have either left town, are not talking, or are dead. He concludes by noting that Skorzeny and all his victims have been cremated, destroying any further ability to investigate the matter and eliminating the possibility that those killed by Skorzeny would in turn rise as vampires and perpetuate the curse.

That resulted in a 1973 follow- up TV film called The Night Strangler and a planned 1974 film titled The Night Killers, which instead evolved into the 1974-1975 television series Kolchak: The Night Stalker, with McGavin reprising his role in both. An episode of the series titled \\"The Vampire\\" was an actual sequel to Stalker, deriving its story from characters introduced in the film. Following the series' cancellation, the franchise was still highly regarded enough to prompt two more TV films, which were created by editing together material from four previous episodes of the series, with some additional narration provided by McGavin as Kolchak to help connect the plot lines. No new footage was included. On September 29, 2005 ABC aired a remake of the 1974 series Kolchak: The Night Stalker, titled Night Stalker. ABC owned the rights to the original TV films, but not the Universal TV series, and were limited only to using characters that had appeared in the films. Release The film was released in 2004 by MGM Home Entertainment as a double feature DVD with The Night Strangler. The DVD also has a 21-minute interview with producer and director Dan Curtis divided between each film: 14 minutes of him discussing Stalker, and on the flipside, 7-minutes of him discussing Strangler.

The Croatian Armed Forces (, HOS) was reorganized in November 1944 to combine the units of the Ustaše and Domobrani into eighteen divisions, comprising 13 infantry, two mountain, two assault and one replacement Croatian divisions, each with its own organic artillery and other support units.

He is the main character in the Black Jack manga franchise. His odd appearance comes from a childhood incident, in which both he and his mother were terribly injured in an explosion. Although Kurō's mother succumbed to her injuries, and Kurō's own body was nearly torn to shreds, he was rescued, thanks to a miraculous operation by Dr. Honma. Although Kurō survived, part of his hair turned white due to stress and shock. The skin covering the left side of Kurō's face is noticeably darker due to getting a skin graft from his best friend, who is half African. Kurō refused to have plastic surgery to match the skin color as a sign of respect for his friend. Marked by this experience, Kurō decided to become a surgeon himself, taking the name of Black Jack. Despite his medical genius, Black Jack has chosen not to obtain a surgical license, choosing instead to operate from the shadows, free from rules and the corrupt bureaucratic establishment. Although he usually treats those he meets in chance encounters who have heard of his legendary skills, he occasionally travels to hospitals around the world to covertly assist terminally ill patients.  Name  Black Jack's real name is . In chapter 68, \\"The Most Beautiful Woman in the World\\" (published April 14, 1975), Black Jack explains the meaning behind both of his names: \\"Kurō\\" is written with the Japanese characters for \\"black\\" and \\"man;\\" as \\"Jack\\" is a common name for a man, he translates his name as \\"Black Jack.\\" His name in the manga is spelled \\"Kuro'o\\". In Volume 10 Chapter 2: \\"The Mask Chosen,\\" he explains to Pinoko that in Japanese, means black and the second represents a jack in a deck of cards. Character Black Jack presents himself as a medical mercenary, selling his skills to whomever will pay his price. He is a shadowy figure, with a black cape, eerie black-and-white hair, and surgical scars snaking all over his body, the most prominent of which being across his face. His appearance and strange, anti-social mannerisms frighten many away from him, but his friends and acquaintances overlook his appearance and idiosyncrasies, knowing him to be principled, skilled, and above all, completely dedicated to the highest ideals of the medical profession. Although his age is not explicitly stated, he is in his late 20s or 30s. He performs some surgeries at home where he has his own operating room, but he more typically travels the world to meet his patients. (He is able to speak multiple languages, including Spanish and English.) He is often seen driving his black car, matching his usual costume, although he also takes public transportation where he is called upon in the event of an on-board emergency. Black Jack cures patients indiscriminately, from common folk, to presidents, to yakuza leaders, and even to supernatural beings, from the very poor to the very rich. However, he charges all of his patients shockingly large sums (from 10 million to billions of yen), sometimes even causing them to jump out of their clothes in surprise (in the manga). A colleague even names a disease after him, because of the outrageous fee he charges for the surgery.Volume 14, Chapter 13: \\"Black Jack Disease\\" Even for those who beg for mercy, Black Jack (at least initially) refuses to lower his price. This has given him a reputation for callousness and greed, an image which he cultivates with care. Contrary to external appearances however, Black Jack possesses a complex personal code. He will cure a patient for free if they move him with the story of their suffering; however, he always establishes a patient's willingness to pay beforehand. If Black Jack cannot discover a redeeming story behind a patient, his fee stands. He also makes exceptions in exigent circumstances, and may change his mind if proven incorrect in his assumptions. He also always ensures that his patients recover completely. Black Jack gives much of the money he earns to charity, paying for other doctors' surgeries as well as his own, and buying up land to protect nature from commercial development. When his patient is wealthy, he usually increases his fee substantially, and often will attach non-quantifiable conditions to his services, such as an agreement to leave erstwhile victims alone, or to protect the environment. Although he gives back most of his earnings to the community, Black Jack occasionally faces robbers seeking the money they believe he hoards.  Surgical skills  Black Jack is a highly skilled doctor, able to handle scalpels and other medical tools quickly and precisely. He frequently reattaches and transplants limbs, performs near-perfect cosmetic surgery, and takes on cases that other surgeons have abandoned and despaired of, even when the other surgeons are widely recognized experts in their field. Black Jack is also known to use his tools for self-defense, showing himself to be capable of clogging the barrel of a gun with a scalpel from some distance. He is also shown to be a ruthless combatant, once even strangling an attacker with surgical tubing. Aside from his speed, precision and ingenuity, Black Jack also has extraordinary fortitude and stamina. In several chapters and episodes, he performs surgeries on himself, * Volume 3 Chapter 3: \\"Dingoes\\" * Volume 10 Chapter 8: \\"Fresh and Blood\\" * Volume 14 Chapter 2: \\"The Third Call\\" and on occasion performs solo operations for 24 consecutive hours. In one instance, he operates on 40 patients simultaneously.  Lack of medical license  While some doctors openly praise Black Jack's for his surgical abilities, others disdain him for not having a license. The manga explains that he lost his medical license when he went against his superiors orders and performed a surgery on his lover who was suffering from the late stages of ovarian cancer. His superiors had said that her illness was too far along to even bother with surgery, but he proceeded anyway and saved her life. As a consequence he lost his medical license. However, since they exiled Black Jack from the medical association he has been able to excel in his medical studies and abilities thus avoiding the restrictions that other doctors must abide in.Volume 6 Chapter 5: \\"Lion-Face Disease\\" Later, when Black Jack is featured in a film, the World Medical Association objects to him being the star, and so his surgical skills are edited out of the final cut.Volume 14 Chapter 10: \\"There were Two Films\\"  Veterinary surgery  There are many instances where Black Jack operates on animals. Before he completed medical school, he practiced making sutures on his own with meat from the local market and even with live fish. He ate them when he was done.Young Black Jack, Episode 3: \\"Deserters.\\" 3:20-4:57. Following is a partial list of animal surgeries after his finishing medical school: * a killer whale in Volume 2 Chapter 3: \\"The Ballad of the Killer Whale\\" (Status: Dead) * a deer in Volume 6 Chapter 11: \\"Nadare\\" (Status: Dead) * a gorilla in Volume 7 Chapter 8: \\"Goribei of Senjogahara\\" (Status: Dead) * a bear in Volume 7 Chapter 11: \\"A Hill for One\\" (Status: Alive) * an Iriomote cat in Volume 9 Chapter 7: \\"A Question of Priorities\\" (Status: Alive) * a dolphin in Volume 10 Chapter 5: \\"Strangers at Sea\\" (Status: Dead) * a poodle in Volume 11 Chapter 5: \\"The Whispers of a Dog\\" (Status: Alive) * a horse in Volume 17 Chapter 5: \\"Avatar\\" (Brain Status: Alive) (Body Status: Dead) * a lion cub in the 2004 anime, Episode 7: \\"White Lion\\" (Status: Alive)  Supernatural encounters  Although Black Jack claims not to believe in supernatural phenomena in medicine, he has nevertheless brushed with the paranormal many times: * Spirits of a plane crash (?) and a spirit hosting the boy in Volume 12 Chapter 11: \\"Operation of the Spirit\\". * A mummy in Volume 13 Chapter 5: \\"The Cursed Operation\\". * A female alien in Volume 13 Chapter 10: \\"A Challenge of the Third Kind\\". * He turns a girl into a bird in Volume 17 Chapter 2: \\"A Girl Who Became a Bird\\". Early youth and appearance Black Jack has a large patch of white hair on the right half of his head and black on the rest. His body is lined with stitches, including a particularly long one on his face. The left side of this scar on his face is a darker color than the right. He is possibly in his late 20s or 30s throughout the main story, and is often seen wearing a black overcoat. When Black Jack was eight years old, he and his mother and father lived in an abandoned military base. Although most of the mines were removed properly, some were left behind. While passing through the minefield, he and his mother triggered a forgotten mine, which suddenly detonated with tragic results. His mother lost all of her limbs and her voice, falling to a coma before passing away. Black Jack himself was all but dead, blasted into 18 different pieces, but he survived with the surgical skills and devotion of Dr. Jōtarō Honma. During this ordeal, Black Jack's friend Takashi (who is half-African) donated some of his skin for a dermal graft, resulting in him having different skin tones for half of his face, which Black Jack later refused to have color-matched out of respect for his friend.Volume 2 Chapter 7: \\"Where Art Thou, Friend?\\" Out of worry for his mother, part of his hair turned prematurely white. Unable to handle the situation, his father ran away with a lover. From that time onward, Black Jack stopped laughing. Wanting revenge, he sought the five people who ruined his mother's life. Among these were IchigaharaVolume 7 Chapter 5: \\"Unexploded Bomb\\" and Takuzo Ubamoto.Volume 12 Chapter 7: \\"The Second One\\" The explosion caused damage to young Black Jack's lungs, giving him pneumothorax. For long afterwards, when meeting a patient with similar pulmonary damage, Black Jack would involuntarily feel sympathetic agony, which developed into an acute phobia. Dr. Yamadano helps cure Black Jack of this fear.Volume 11 Chapter 1: \\"Spasm\\"  Romantic interests  While still in medical school, Black Jack becomes friends with the dedicated medical intern Maiko Okamoto. They meet when the rest of the school is embroiled in a protest and strike over intern wages, and a three-way accident between a bicycle, bus and train catches the school's hospital understaffed. Although about to pass over the young Black Jack for his strange personality (she finds him sitting on a bench with his eyes closed, muttering and practicing surgery in thin air), she approaches him for help anyway out of desperation. Admiring his skill in action, she remarks to herself, \\"Patches [Black Jack] isn't half bad!\\"Young Black Jack. Episode 1: \\"Where's the Doctor?\\" From there, their relationship deepens as she finds out more about his past and reinforces his emotional development with more compassion and warmth.Young Black Jack. Episode 3: \\"Deserters\\" Throughout the series, Pinoko (his adopted daughter) has expressed love towards Black Jack which even she herself admits is impossible due to her small body. She often daydreams of going on dates with him and refers to herself as his wife to several people they meet though she does on occasion show attraction to other handsome young men. Black Jack himself denies these claims and often tells her she is his daughter. He even admits to her at one point that he is not suited for love and claimed he only saved her to use her to blackmail her family (this is heavily implied to be a lie). Nonetheless, there are times he does seem to respect her feelings. When he thought she was dying, he built her a human adult body and promised to marry her during her final moments but managed to save her and never gave her the adult body. She also writes multiple love letters to him which he is exasperated by. In addition, when he has a dream about the people that he has met and impacted him, Pinoko appears as an adult and asks to be told he loves her. While he does not state it, he does refer to her as his wife. Overall, it is evident he does love her but his feelings don't seem to go beyond a paternal love mainly because of her body and childish personality. It is mentioned in Volume 1 chapter 6 that after graduating and becoming an intern, Black Jack fell in love with Megumi Kisaragi. Tragically, she had ovarian cancer, and after having her ovaries removed, she began living her life as a man, taking on the name Kei. In Volume 1 chapter 9, there was a female surgeon named Konomi Kuwata (nicknamed Black Queen due to her ability to perform amputations without batting an eye) whom he became interested in because she seemed similar to him. In the manga, he was going to give her a letter but upon seeing her grief over having to amputate her own fiancé's leg, decides to do the surgery himself and leaves before telling her of his feelings. In the anime, his feelings for her are less definite (it is implied he may have developed some feeling for her though not to the extent as in the manga) and the two meet again in Black Jack 21 as good friends and colleagues, with her still as a surgeon. A teenage cancer patient named Michiru obsessed with marriage announces her desire to marry Black Jack, much to Pinoko's dismay. To lift her spirits and improve her chances of survival, Black Jack agrees to play the part of the groom. After the surgery however, he tells her that it was a fantasy to begin with, and says that he is not fit for love or marriage.Volume 14 Chapter 3: \\"A Transient Love\\" In volume 3 \\"Black Jack in Hospital\\" A young inexperienced female doctor who has been in love with Black Jack meets him after he breaks his arm and her brother performs a surgery on him, though at the same time voices his dislike for Black Jack. Despite this the older brother doctor asks Black Jack to marry his sister or never appear before her again. Black Jack agrees and leaves but meets with her one last time to perform the operation on her brother after he is hit by a truck. In addition, in Volume 10 chapter 9 \\"Burglary\\", a woman who was on a honeymoon drive with her husband barely survived a landslide. She had to have her arms amputated by Black Jack who also took care of her rehabilitation. She fell in love with him and her husband, realizing this, had her leave. She later had her prosthetic stolen but refused to retrieve them. Black Jack managed to find them along with discovering letters and photos of himself among the prosthetic, revealing her feelings for him. He returns the prosthetic to her but rejects her feelings and wishes for her happiness. In Volume 15 Chapter 2 \\"A Star is Born\\" a young woman named Igusa Suginami fell in love with Black Jack after he gave her plastic surgery and operated on her face to make her prettier and to make her a bigger star. Black Jack, however, believed she was better with her original face and due to interference by Suginami's manager, she is forced to leave and give up on Black Jack. In Volume 15 chapter 7, a woman suffering from a type of schizophrenia called Catatonia ran away from home and fell off a cliff. Black Jack tried discussing with the dad to save her (for 30 million yen). When he finds her, the two end up stuck on the mountain due to heavy rain for ten days. The two get to know each other and it is revealed the father decided not to pay to cure his daughter's surgery and instead abandoned her but Black Jack still went to save her because she reminded him of himself. While dying from her wounds from her fall off the cliff and her illness, she admits she loves him and asks him to marry her. He tries to save her as help arrives, but it is implied she died. Later, when Black Jack visits the grave of a fellow surgeon on a remote island to pay his respects, he meets his colleague's sister, Dr. Shimizu Ikuo. The sole doctor of the island, she originally came to help her brother, and develops feelings for Black Jack. However, she is killed saving a child from a rockslide; with her dying breath, she asks Black Jack to mimic his facial graft on her skin so that they can be together forever though he chooses not to as he believes she was too beautiful to carve a scar on and her body is buried with her brother's. In the anime, she instead survives though he leaves the island as he sees that the island needs a doctor like her.Volume 6 Chapter 1: Downpour\\"  Pinoko  The doctor is usually in the company of his ward, Pinoko (also spelled Pinoco). Originally her body development was severely hampered by being her sister's in utero twin, Black Jack was able to surgically extricated her alive. As her organs and internal musculature were salvaged, Black Jack constructed a synthetic body appropriate in size to her organs. While possessing the knowledge of an 18-year-old, she appears a child around 6. Saving her life, yet not wanted by her sister and family, Black Jack adopting her as his daughter. Although she appears to be a fully functional human, Pinoko is incapable of physical growth, and has the personality and appearance of a first grader. Pinoko capably acts as housekeeper, cook and surgical assistant (especially in his home clinic and operating room), but more importantly provides moral support and human warmth to the otherwise emotionally distant doctor.  Other skills  In addition to his medical skills, Black Jack is a skilled fighter. While not violent by nature, he will not hesitate to use force to defend himself or others. Though preferring to fight with his fists, he can use a gun and throw scalpels like darts, having been skilled at darts even as young boy.Volume 12, Chapter 13: \\"Prone to Laughter\\" He carries many extra scalpels in his signature black coat for emergencies, allowing it to double as a bullet-proof vest. As such, he wears his coat even on sunny days. Black Jack knows how to operate a motorboat and is fluent in Morse Code (Volume 17 Chapter 4: \\"Captain Park\\").  Hobbies and habits  Black Jack usually drinks tea or coffee with his rice when he goes to a poor house, and eats curry at restaurants. He is sometimes seen smoking a cigarette or a pipe. He always tries to heal his patients but he will get very emotionally upset if: 1) someone takes his patients; 2) his patients commit suicide; 3) someone kills his patients; or 4) death was inevitable. There were times where people attacked him and was very near death. He even went to jail a few times. Volume 10 Chapter 7: \\"The Man who Threw up Capsules\\" was the only time Black Jack is seen with a beard. While his preference in food is never mentioned, he is often shown eating curry or tea over rice (chazuke). Black Jack enjoys watching oil painting shows.Volume 13, Chapter 12: \\"Move, Solomon!\\"  Clinic and House Black Jack's single-floor cottage was designed and constructed by the somewhat vain carpenter Ushigoro in 1932, using the French colonial or Creole style. In the manga, Pinoko finds a hand print on the house left by Ushigoro, a maker's mark that he leaves on every house he builds in lieu of a signature. If his customer objects to the hand print, he leaves it in the attic.Volume 10 Chapter 4: \\"Unfinished House\\" At least 40 years old by the time Black Jack buys the house, fresh from school, it tends to leak during the rainstorms frequenting the coastal area (especially in the OVA, Black Jack 21). It sits on a sheer cliff, with a rear porch topped by a châteauesque conical spire overlooking the sea, while a dirt road leads up the hill to the full-width veranda in the front.Opening sequence throughout the 2004 anime. The house has two bedrooms, with one for guests and one Black Jack and his adopted daughter Pinoko, who sleep in separate twin beds. Unusually, the house also features a small operating room, which Black Jack and Ushigoro built together after Black Jack moved in. Although he usually performs surgeries in more-fully-equipped and staffed hospital operating rooms, and even on-site when in more pressing situations, his own operating room sees use in the televised anime, episode 7, when he removes a tumor from a lion cub, and again in episode 22 when treating a boy with mirrored organs and a congenitally enlarged bile duct. The house later collapses during an earthquake,Volume 4 Chapter 14: \\"Thieving Dog\\" and is finally destroyed in a typhoon many volumes later.Volume 17 Chapter 11: \\"After the Typhoon\\"  Concept and creation  Besides being a manga artist, Osamu Tezuka was also a licensed physician. He created many manga titles with medical themes and physician protagonists, and Black Jack may be a personification of himself. Black Jack has been called Tezuka's alter ego, the kind of doctor he wished he could have been. The character was created for the 40th anniversary of Tezuka's professional manga career. It was originally intended as a five-part miniseries but, thanks to the audience reception, Tezuka's engagement with the character was extended to five years. Black Jack's attitude and matter of dress are meant to remind readers of the archetypal pirate: rebellious and clever, a man who operates outside the restricting bureaucracy of modern life. His scar embodies the principle of the flawed hero: his half-black, half-white face foregoes any claim to \\"purity\\"—be it cultural or ideological—and betrays the complexity of the character. A pirate carrying a similar scar, Captain Harlock, was introduced in 1953's \\"Adventures of a Honeybee\\" prior to Black Jack's creation, however Black Jack became the star of his own manga series years before Harlock did. In the end, Black Jack is capable of great kindness as well as brutal cruelty.  Other appearances  As part of \\"Osamu Tezuka's Star System\\", Black Jack has appeared in several of the artist's works. Black Jack starred as a side character in episode 27, \\"The Time Machine,\\" of the 1980 animated adaptation of Tezuka's Astro Boy. Both he and Astro were recruited by a detective from the distant future, and taken back to a medieval castle to catch a man attempting to alter the timeline, where Black Jack was to heal a sick prince (actually Tezuka character Princess Knight) while Astro was to protect the castle from an evil sorcerer. While Astro attempts to fight the beasts sent by the sorcerer, Black Jack discovers that the prince is actually a princess, and, using clever deception, manages to heal her as Astro defeats the sorcerer. In true Black Jack fashion, he tells the town to learn to accept that they have a female ruler, and refuses payment, instead taking a commemorative coin before returning to the future, which Astro values the mint condition artifact to today be worth several million dollars. Black Jack makes cameo appearances in 1979's Marine Express, in 1980's Phoenix 2772 as the foreman of the prison planet labor camp, and in the 2004 video games Astro Boy and Astro Boy: Omega Factor. He also appears in one panel in Tezuka's work Buddha as a hallucination as well as a cameo under a different name and somewhat different appearance in \\"Phoenix\\" in the volume titled \\"Nostalgia\\", where he apparently holds some degree of power over a group of thugs about to take advantage of the main character Romy. Black Jack is also ambiguously referenced in the manga Pluto, a remake of Astro Boy created by Naoki Urasawa with approval from Osamu Tezuka before his death. In 2010, a short was released showing Black Jack teaming up with Dr. House to promote the DVD release of the show's fourth season. In it, Black Jack was hired to replace Kutner. House immediately takes a dislike to him, and vice versa, but Black Jack quits on amicable terms with House after they cooperate on a difficult surgery. Black Jack appears alongside fellow Tezuka character Astro Boy as a playable character in the 2019 crossover puzzle game Crystal Crisis.  Cultural impact and legacy  Black Jack is one of Tezuka's most beloved characters and his popularity is rivaled only by Astro Boy. Other manga artists have paid homage to Tezuka's surgeon. Shūhō Satō's Say Hello to Black Jack is named after Tezuka's character. A surgeon, identified only as B.J., appears in Akihito Yoshitomi's Ray. In the story, B.J. operates on the title character, giving her X-ray vision. The character of former police coroner and serial killer Shingo Zuhaku, whose design is based on Tezuka's Black Jack, appears in horror manga The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service by Eiji Ōtsuka and Housui Yamazaki. Kamen Rider Den-O's Imagin Anime OVA parodized Black Jack by having Ryutaros cosplay as him in a doctor sketch. The character from Kamen Rider Ex-Aid, Taiga Hanaya/Kamen Rider Snipe is based on Black Jack himself, so as his female gaming genius sidekick Nico Saiba shares a similar role as Pinoko. During the 2007 batsu game for Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!, which took place at a hospital, comedian Itsuji Itao repeatedly appeared during the game dressed up as Black Jack, with requisite black cape, hair and scar. Pinoko also appears by his side. He'd leave the scene after being spotted, with an announcer saying \\"Itsuji Itao presents: Black Jack!\\" IGN ranked him as the 24th greatest anime character of all time, saying he \\"did what few characters in anime have achieved: he made an everyday profession into something heroic.\\"  References  External links  * Black Jack in the Tezuka World database * in the Tezuka in English database Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973 Category:Black Jack (manga) Category:Osamu Tezuka characters Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Fictional physicians Category:Fictional criminals Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Fictional orphans ","title":"Black Jack (manga character)"},{"id":"13439120","text":"The 1077th Anti-aircraft Regiment (, 1077-y zenitnyy artilleriyskiy polk) under Colonel Raiynin, was a unit of the Stalingrad Corps Region of the Soviet Air Defence Forces which fought during the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942.БОЕВОЙ СОСТАВ СОВЕТСКОЙ АРМИИ 1941 - 1945 (Official Soviet Army Order of Battle from General Staff Archives). http://www.tashv.nm.ru/BoevojSostavSA/1942/19420801.html The Stalingrad Corps Region was part of the Stalingrad Military District and later subordinated to the Stalingrad Front during the battle for the city. The regiment, like many of the anti-aircraft units, was made up almost entirely of teenage female volunteers, barely out of high school. They are mostly known for their bravery in the defense of Stalingrad (now Volgograd), when they engaged an advancing Panzer unit by setting their guns to the lowest elevation and firing them directly at the advancing tanks.  Training and materials  English-language sources about this unit are sparse and contradictory. What seems clear is that, like most of the anti-aircraft units, they were poorly trained and under-supplied with ammunition. They probably did not have armour piercing rounds, but rather fragmentation 'flak' rounds, and it is questionable how effective these would have been against armour. Their guns were M1939 guns which were 37mm copies of Bofors.  Defence of Stalingrad  On August 23, 1942, the German 6th Army launched its offensive on Stalingrad. After extensive bombing which turned much of the city into an inferno, the 16th Panzer Division advanced unresisted until it reached Gumrak airport, 15 km northwest of the city, where the tanks came under fire from anti-aircraft guns. The 16th Panzer Division recorded that \\"right until afternoon we had to fight 'shot for shot' against 37 anti-aircraft positions manned by tenacious fighting women, until all were destroyed.\\" The Soviet official history of the war also makes mention of this action: > The anti-aircraft troops first engaged the Panzers on August 23rd on the > northern outskirts of the city. An attack from this quarter by the enemy had > been unexpected, and so there were no rifle units in position to assist the > batteries of the 1077th Anti-Aircraft Regiment in their defense against the > strong concentration of German tanks and motorized infantry. Under the > command of Colonel W. S. German, for two days the regiment fought alone and > repelled the assaults of German submachine-gunners. During the combat, the > regiment destroyed or damaged 83 tanks and 15 other vehicles carrying > infantry, destroyed or dispersed over three battalions of assault infantry, > and shot down 14 aircraft. The 1077th Anti-Aircraft Regiment remained in service with the Soviet forces to the end of the war. In May 1945, the regiment was part of the 86th Air Defense Forces Division, itself subordinated to the Southwestern Front. In 1945, the 86th Division was charged with air defense support for the Kharkov and Odessa Military Regions, and also for the Independent Coastal Army.  Notes  References  * Beevor, Antony (1999).

The film stars Katherine Heigl and James Marsden. The film was released January 10, 2008 in Australia and opened in the United States on January 18. Plot Jane Nichols (Katherine Heigl) has been a bridesmaid for 27 weddings. One night when she is attending two weddings almost simultaneously, she meets Kevin Doyle (James Marsden), who helps her get home but discusses with her his cynical views of marriage. He finds her day planner in the cab they shared. Meanwhile, Jane's sister Tess (Malin Åkerman) arrives from Europe and falls in love with Jane's boss George (Edward Burns) at first sight. Tess pretends to like the same things that George does to get him to like her. Despite being in love with George herself, Jane does not reveal the truth and her sister's courtship progresses rapidly. Soon the new couple announce that they intend to marry in three weeks and Jane becomes the wedding planner. The reporter who agrees to post their wedding turns out to be Kevin, who writes wedding announcements under the name Malcolm Doyle. After looking at the contents of Jane's planner, he decides to use the contents as material for a piece on the \\"perpetual bridesmaid\\" and hopefully be promoted to writing investigative pieces about the real news. Jane is unaware of Kevin's intentions. When he asks to interview her for his column on Tess, he gets her to try on all 27 bridesmaids dresses in her closet. He takes pictures of her in all of them and sends them with the completed article to his boss. As they get to know each other, Kevin begins to think that Jane is not as one-dimensional as he thought and asks his editor to hold his article so he can \\"fix\\" it. When Kevin finds out that Jane is getting her sister's marriage fixed with the man she loves, he rebukes her. Jane agrees to one drink with Kevin and ends up getting drunk. That has both of them kiss and have sex in the car. The next morning, the two go to a diner and a waitress recognizes Jane. Kevin's editor ran the article on the front page of the 'Commitments' section, despite Kevin and her settling to hold it for a while. When Jane finds out about it, she feels betrayed and is furious at him. Tess then gets angry at Jane for giving Kevin material about her, whom he describes as a bridezilla. The fight escalates when Jane sees that Tess altered their late mother's wedding dress to her own style — the last straw on Tess' string of lies to George and demands on Jane. Despite the fight, Tess asks Jane to make a slideshow for her engagement party. Jane decides that George should know the truth about Tess. She shows pictures of Tess with other men, eating ribs (as she claimed that she is a vegetarian, like George), holding a cat by the tail, and recoiling from George's dog (she told him that she loves dogs, but actually hates them) — in short, doing all the things she had told George that she never did. After that, Pedro (David Castro), the child George mentors, reveals to the crowd that Tess had actually have him clean George's apartment for money. All of this humiliating truth to her seem irrational, and so George breaks off the engagement to the wedding. Jane's friend, Casey (Judy Greer), points out that telling the truth to George and breaking their engagement at the party didn't help the situation, and that it would have been better if she had been upfront with him in the beginning. The next day, Jane meets Tess to apologize. She is still mad with Jane, as Tess believes that Jane resented her throughout the years. Tess reveals that the reason she stayed in New York was because she got fired from her job and her boyfriend dumped her; she explains that when she met George she'd tried to be like Jane since she fell in love with him. Tess also encourages Jane to focus on her life and her own needs, rather than becoming a pushover for all of her friends by bending over backwards for their every desire. Later at work, George tells Jane that he appreciates her because she never says no. Remembering that Kevin once said the same thing as a criticism, Jane quits and admits she only stayed at the job because she was in love with George. She discovers after two experimental kisses that she no longer loves him and goes to meet Kevin. She announces in front of a crowd at a wedding he is covering that she is in love with him. One year later Jane and Kevin are getting married. George and Tess meet again and a hope for a second chance shows. All 27 brides whom Jane helped, as well as Tess and Casey, are her bridesmaids, wearing the dresses she once wore as their bridesmaid.

Member Hospitals=Duke University Hospital The Duke University Medical Center is located in Durham, North Carolina and affiliated with Duke University. Formerly known as the Duke University Hospital and Medical School, it was established in 1930 with a bequest from James B. Duke. The Medical Center now occupies 7.5 million square feet (700,000 m²) in 90 buildings on 210 acres (850,000 m²). It is consistently ranked among the top ten health care organizations in the United States. In 2007, U.S. News & World Report ranked Duke University Medical Center 7th-best medical center in the United States from among 5,462 medical centers. The Duke Clinic is located next to the Duke Medical Center and provides access to numerous specialties and outpatient services. Duke University Hospital has 957 inpatient beds and offers comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic facilities, including a regional emergency/trauma center; a major surgery suite containing 51 operating rooms; an endosurgery center; an Ambulatory Surgery Center with nine operating rooms and an extensive diagnostic and interventional radiology area. In fiscal year 2016, Duke University Hospital admitted 41,408 patients and had 1,119,151 outpatient visits. In 1925, James B. Duke made a $4 million bequest to establish the Duke University School of Medicine, Duke University School of Nursing, and Duke University Hospital to improve health care in the Carolinas and the United States. This money was used to begin construction on the Duke Hospital and Medical School in 1927. On July 21, 1930, the hospital opened to patients. On its first day, 17 of its 400 beds were filled. In 1936, Julian Deryl Hart, a Duke surgeon introduced ultraviolet lights in the operating rooms to kill airborne germs. In 1956, Duke surgeons were the first to use systemic hypothermia during cardiac surgery. This is now standard practice worldwide. The Medical School and Hospital were renamed the Duke University Medical Center in 1957. The first African American student was admitted to the Duke University School of Medicine in 1963. In 1969, the first recorded studies of human's abilities to function and work at pressures equal to a deep sea dive were conducted. In the 1990s, Duke geneticists invented a three- minute test to screen newborns for over 30 metabolic diseases at once. This test is now used throughout the United States. Duke's first lung transplant and heart/lung transplant were conducted in 1992. Duke Children's Hospital & Health Center Duke Children's Hospital & Health Center is a hospital providing healthcare for children from birth through young adulthood. The hospital includes a neonatal intensive care unit and a pediatric intensive care unit. The McGovern-Davison Children's Health Center, housed within the hospital, provides outpatient care in more than 28 pediatric medical and surgical specialties. Duke Children's also offers primary care at several locations within Durham County. The Duke Children's Miracle Network raises unrestricted funds for Duke Children's Hospital & Health Center through Children's Miracle Network. Funds are used to support research, clinical care, and family support programs. Children admitted to the hospital may continue to attend school while receiving treatment. Established in 1959, the hospital school is part of the Durham Public Schools system. 30-40 students are enrolled in the school on average and 8 teachers cover all grades from pre- kindergarten through high school. Duke Regional Hospital Duke Regional Hospital (DRH) provides inpatient, outpatient, surgical and emergency care and features a level II intensive care nursery, Durham Regional Rehabilitation Institute and the Davis Ambulatory Surgical Center. Newborn care at Duke Regional Hospital is provided by physicians from Duke Children's Hospital. Duke Regional Hospital has 369 inpatient beds. In fiscal year 2016, Duke Regional Hospital admitted 15,792 patients and had 123,234 outpatient visits. Duke Regional Hospital was previously known as Durham County General Hospital which opened its doors on October 3, 1976. Durham County General Hospital was the result of a merging of Lincoln Hospital (an all African American hospital) and Watts Hospital (an all white hospital). During the 1990s, the region's population increased. The hospital responded by expanding its focus to also serve the metropolitan counties of: Orange, Person, Chatham, and Granville counties. The expanded service area resulted in changing the name to Durham Regional Hospital. In 1998, an agreement with Duke University Health System was signed and the two officially began a 20-year partnership. The agreement was amended in 2009, extending the partnership for a \\"rolling\\" 40-year term. On July 1, 2013, Durham Regional Hospital became Duke Regional Hospital. Duke Raleigh Hospital Duke Raleigh Hospital (DRaH) has been a member of the Duke University Health System family since 1998. Christened \\"Mary Elizabeth Hospital\\" when it opened its doors in 1914, under the leadership of Doctor P.G.

In later life Scurry worked as an architectural modeller and orchardist before his war injuries forced him to retire. During the Second World War, he served on home service, as commandant of an internment camp before retiring to civilian life following the end of the war. He died in 1963.Brown, Rachel, \\"WWI anniversary: Soldier William Scurry honoured for devising drip rifle used in Gallipoli evacuation\\", ABC News, 21 December 2015.Brown, Rachel, \\"Lance Corporal Scurry – the man behind Gallipoli's 'ghost rifle brigade'\\", 7.30 (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), 21 December 2015. Early life Scurry was born in Carlton, Melbourne, to William Charles Scurry, an architectural modeller, and his English wife, Bessie Scurry (née Preston). He attended Ascot Vale State School before working for his father's firm. As part of the compulsory training scheme he served in the Senior Cadets before progressing on to the Citizens Forces in 1913 where he served as a colour sergeant before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in May 1914 and assigned to the 58th Infantry (Essendon Rifles). First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War, Scurry relinquished his commission and enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1915 as a private. Assigned to the 7th Battalion, he was sent to join the battalion at Gallipoli in November 1915 and was promoted to lance corporal in December. Shortly after his arrival, the Allies decided to evacuate the peninsula and Scurry, along with his friend 'Buntie' Lawrence developed the self-firing rifle which worked simply by having water from one bully beef tin drip into a lower tin. When the water in the lower tin, which was attached to the trigger of the rifle, reached a certain weight, the rifle was fired. This ruse led to the Turkish defenders believing that there were still troops opposing them, even after the soldiers had been evacuated. For his invention, Scurry was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and Mentioned in Despatches. Following the evacuation, after the AIF had returned to Egypt, Scurry was promoted to sergeant and then later, on 20 February 1916, was again commissioned as a second lieutenant. At this time the AIF underwent a period of expansion and experienced men were needed as cadre for new battalions that were being raised; subsequently Scurry was transferred to the 58th Battalion and in June, as his battalion was deployed to France where they would serve in the trenches along the Western Front, Scurry was promoted to lieutenant. Shortly after arriving in France, he was placed in command of the 15th Light Trench Mortar Battery on specific request of his brigade commander, Harold Edward Elliott, who had been his battalion commander at Gallipoli, and promoted to temporary captain. For his leadership of this battery, he was later awarded the Military Cross. In 1916, when in Petillon, France, he was badly wounded when inspecting a new kind of fuse on an unexploded bomb. He was evacuated to England and eventually lost the sight in one eye, and his right index finger. However, he continued to serve and became an instructor at I Anzac Corps School at Aveluy in June 1917. He later became the School's chief instructor, before returning to the front in 1918. Later life Following the armistice, Scurry returned to Australia in 1919 and he became engaged to Doris Barry, an Army nurse he had met while in France. The couple were married in 1920 and later had four children. He returned to his father's firm, however, in 1923 as his vision failed he was forced to give up working as an architectural modeller. He subsequently moved to Silvan where he became an orchardist before his injury forced him to give up this work also. During the Second World War, Scurry re-enlisted in the Army on 5 September 1940 and served with the 17th Garrison Battalion with the rank of captain, before later taking up the post of commandant of the Tatura Internment Camp, then with the rank of major. He was discharged on 8 October 1945 and retired to Croydon, where he died on 28 December 1963 of a coronary occlusion. He was later interred at Lilydale cemetery. NotesReferences * * . * . * .

It is loosely based on the 2001 British film Hot Money. Plot The film begins in medias res, with the suspects getting caught and being interrogated. Then it flashes back to three years earlier and the film continues forward from there, interspersed with occasional bits from the interrogation. Three years before getting caught, Bridget Cardigan (Diane Keaton) lived a comfortable upper middle class life until her husband Don Cardigan (Ted Danson) was \\"downsized\\" from his position and sank into debt. The paycheck for Selina, the housecleaner, bounces again. Selina confronts Bridget and suggests she take a job as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. On her first day on the job, Bridget hatches a scheme to steal worn-out dollar bills slated for destruction. For her team she chooses Nina (Queen Latifah), who works the dollar bill shredder, and Jackie (Katie Holmes), who takes bill carts from the Secret Service room to the shredding room. It takes some work to persuade Nina to join, but Jackie joins them quickly. The plan is that in the Secret Service room Bridget will switch a cart's official Master-brand lock with a near identical lock she purchased at Home Depot. Bridget will tell Jackie the cart number and give Nina the official lock. When Jackie gets the chosen cart, she dumps some bills from the cart into a trash can before taking the cart to Nina, who then uses Bridget's key to open it and restores the official lock, and then proceeds to shred the remaining bills. Meanwhile, Bridget, in the course of her janitorial duties, retrieves the dumped bills from the trash and splits them among Nina and Jackie in the women's restroom. Their first robbery is a success though the take is not as big as they had hoped. However, they're emboldened to do it repeatedly. Once Don and Bridget pay off their debt, Don suggests they stop before they get caught. Bridget rejects this idea and persuades Nina and Jackie to keep going. They almost get caught but they end up cutting in Barry (Roger Cross), one of the security guards, who is attracted to Nina. A Federal Bank Examiner shows up at a party at Bridget's house, and the next day Bridget sees him at work. The Examiner confronts Glover (Stephen Root), who is unwilling as a matter of professional pride to admit anyone has stolen a single bill out of his bank. Tipped off, that night Bridget and her accomplices begin trying to get rid of all the loot stashed in their houses, but the cops move in before all the evidence is destroyed. Bridget escapes but the others get caught. Bridget hires a tax attorney to defend them. The lawyer gets Bridget and all her accomplices off the hook for their crimes, because neither the law enforcement, nor the examiner can prove that the large stash of cash in their homes came from the Federal Reserve Bank. Technically, it isn't illegal to have a couple of hundred thousand dollars in cash lying around inside a private residence. However, they spent a large sum of that stolen cash to buy expensive objects and improvements on their houses, and did not pay the taxes for them because they couldn't justify the income. The IRS demands they pay their taxes, which turn out to be equal in amount to the money that still remains. Eight months later, Bridget reveals to Nina and Jackie that she had stashed away much of the stolen money in the basement of a friend's bar. CastOriginal UK version The original UK version produced by Granada Television, Hot Money (2001), tells the story of three women, Bridget, Liz and Jackie, who embarked on a plan to steal thousands of pounds of banknotes that were due to be destroyed at the Bank of England's incinerating plant in Essex. It was a fictionalised account of the Loughton incinerator thefts. Release Mad Money was released on DVD May 13, 2008. In the DVD director's commentary, director Callie Khouri credits producer Jay Cohen as having brought her the British film he had obtained rights to be called Hot Money. Hot Money is based on the true story of a group of women who worked at the Bank of England and, over an unknown period, removed an unknown amount of money that was supposed to be destroyed. No one except these women know the exact details of the theft. Callie Khouri and Jay Cohen worked 5 years to bring a deliberately Americanized version of Hot Money to the screen as Mad Money using various writers. Both Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah were attached early on to the project and writers began designing the characters specifically around the two actresses. Reception=Box office The film debuted in fifth place at the box office on its opening day in the United States, with a return of US$2.3 million from 2,470 screens. Reuters referred to this return as a \\"modest\\" result for the film's opening day. By the end of its opening weekend, Mad Money had slipped to seventh place, with a weekend take of $7.7 million. Writing for Rotten Tomatoes, Gitesh Pandya noted that the opening weekend per theater revenue \\"averaged a not-so-impressive $3,126.\\" amNewYork called the film's opening weekend return \\"a big flop at the box office,\\" and the New Zealand Herald described it as \\"a box-office flop\\". Richard Johnson of the New York Post wrote that the movie \\"bombed, debuting at an abysmal seventh place on the box-office charts.\\" The film's four-day take was a dismal $9.2 million. The film also did not fare well in its release in other countries, and Conor Bresnan of Box Office Mojo reported that \\"Mad Money bombed in its first two markets\\" overseas. With an estimated budget of $22 million, the film had broken even by the time it came off theaters. Critical reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 22% of 105 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"A laborious, unfunny and implausible heist film.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 41 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film a rating of one and a half stars, and wrote, \\"The bottom line is, some girls will like it, the men not so much.\\" The film also received one and a half stars in a review in the Chicago Tribune, and Michael Phillips wrote that the film's cast was not to blame: \\"Do not blame the cast. The cast is game. The dreary visual scheme, however, combines unwell with the pokey, enervated rhythm of the heist scenes, and while I'm neither a medical doctor nor a script doctor, it seems this film could use a few uppers.\\" The film received three stars in Newsday, and Jan Stuart wrote \\"Mad Money is no Rififi, but Khouri and Gers invest it with an individuality and generosity of spirit that lift it into the realm of guiltless pleasure.\\" Bill Wine of All Headline News gave the film two and a half stars, writing \\"Mad Money is a light and lively, likable low-tech lark. Don't expect big laughs, but you can at least bank on it to hold your interest.\\" The Canadian Press gave the film one and a half stars, and criticized Katie Holmes's performance \\"While Keaton has long done zany and giddy well, and she and Latifah have an interesting contrast of personalities, Holmes' presence feels like an afterthought.\\" The New York Post, The New York Times and Variety also criticized Katie Holmes's performance in the film, and The New York Times called Holmes \\"the movie's weakest link.\\" In an article in the Boston Herald titled \\"Don't waste your Mad Money on poor comedy\\", Stephen Schaefer gave the film a rating of \\"C\\", writing \\"Even with the legendary Diane Keaton center stage, Mad Money fails to hit the stratosphere of giddy, intoxicating comedy.\\" The film received a critical review in from Claudia Puig in USA Today \\"Is it the perfect crime? No, it's a particularly imperfect heist comedy that offers little entertainment value and few laughs.\\" The film scored a third place in the New York Post's Top 10 Worst Movies of 2008 overview.

It is part of Dalian Hi-Tech Zone in the broader sense. While American and European companies typically have gone to Bangalore and other cities in India because of the English language capability, Japanese companies have gone to Dalian and other cities in China due to the Japanese language capability. DLSP is owned by Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd., which was invested and established by Yida Group and is a professional service provider in business park development, management and operation. By the end of 2009, there were over 500 enterprises in the Dalian Software Park, 41 percent of which are foreign-funded. There are 37 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, HP, Accenture, Panasonic, Sony, Hitachi, NTT, Oracle, AVAYA, NEC, Fidelity, BT etc. In 2009, Dalian Software Park realized an annual sales income of RMB 20.2 billion, with an export value of US$0.86 billion. Dalian is one of China's 11 \\"National Software Industry Bases\\" and one of five \\"National Software Export Bases.\\" Currently, more than 300 companies, including 32 Global 500 corporations, have offices in the park. The nearest airport, Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport, is 10–20 km away from Dalian Software Park. Its nearest national highway is G202.RightSite.asia  Dalian Software Park Flow of overseas IT outsourcing Beginning in the 1980s, many IT companies in the developed world began to take interest in offshore labour markets. IT related work in the developed countries had been suffering from lack of IT workers and increased cost. The worldwide trend is now moving from domestic outsourcing to overseas outsourcing into countries that have a comparative advantage in labour-intensive business activities. The IT work is not only software development which require engineering skills (ITO), but also other business work which requires soft skills rather than engineering skills. (BPO), such as call center and other information services is a major aspect of DLSP's tenant's offshore business. Launch of Dalian's software industry Having been the major industrial base of Manchukuo during Japanese colonization, Dalian has a history of foreign investment. Since the early 1980s, Dalian has been a major recipient of Japanese and Korean foreign investment. Software development in Dalian began in the early 1980s. To attract economic activity, the municipal government established Dalian Development Area in the northern suburbs and Dalian Hi-Tech Zone in the western suburbs for the high-tech industries. During the first half of the 1990s, application software outsourcing from overseas, particularly from Japan, has increased. Dalian Hi-Think Computer Technology Corp. (DHC), which had derived from Dalian City Computer Center, and Dalian Hisoft Corp. were established in the high-tech zone. They were involved in application software development, outsourced from NTT Data, NEC, Hitachi Software Engineering, etc. Since the 1990s Dalian City has emphasized the development of the IT industry, especially in Dalian Hi-Tech Zone and Dalian Software Park in the western suburbs near Dalian University of Technology. There are Chinese IT companies (such as DHC, hiSoft and Neusoft Group) and American, European, Indian and Japanese IT companies, such as Accenture, Dell, Genpact, HP, IBM, Liferay, SAP AG, Oracle Corporation, Siemens, Alpine, CSK Holding, Panasonic, NEC, Sony, Cisco, Netapp, British Telecom, Aspect, and Fidelity. Currently, the \\"Lushun South Road Software Industry Belt\\" Plan is proceeding, including Dalian Software Park Phase 2. Dalian has recently become an important center for information technology offshoring and business process outsourcing, similar to Bangalore in India; the city was described in The World Is Flat by Thomas Friedman (2007). In another way, Dalian is the forerunner of China's \\"Re- Development of the Old Industry Bases in Northeast\\" National Project, which began in 2002. Today, Dalian is the most established information technology outsourcing (ITO) and business processing outsourcing (BPO) city in the PRC and among the top ITO and BPO destinations in the world. Birth of Dalian Software Park Dalian Software Park model Dalian Software Park (DLSP) was established in 1998, in the 3 km2 area, in the western suburb of Dalian, near Dalian High-Tech Zone. It is surrounded by the hills on the three sides and by the Yellow Sea on the remaining side, and is an academic area where Dalian University of Technology and Dongbei University of Finance and Economics are located. Management of the Park is done by Dalian Software Park Co., Ltd., a private enterprise 100 percent owned by one of the three largest real estate developers in Dalian (Yida Group), which is rare in China where all other software parks are managed either directly by local governments or indirectly by government agencies. The company provides professional services, from registration and basic property management to human resource services to assist in the operations of the IT companies. See also \\"Preferential policies\\" below. Today, Dalian Software Park is the leading business park management and development company in the PRC. In addition to the park in Dalian, DLSP has developed parks in Wuhan, Suzhou, and Tianjin. History Established in 1999, Dalian Software Park is a key part of the development of Dalian, a hub of the international IT industry in China. With an area covering 7.16 square kilometers, Dalian Software Park is one of the ten State-level software industry bases. Its export volume is increasing by 100 percent annually. Over 300 enterprises, including more than 60 foreign companies, have settled their IT business in the park. As it opened officially, Neusoft Group came to this park to establish their development centers, and later established Neusoft Institute of Information. Matsushita Electric Industrial (Panasonic) was the first to enter the park, followed by Alpine, Sony and others. American and European companies, such as GE (Genpact), HP, IBM and SAP, came to establish ITO and/or BPO centers, mainly to do their Japanese subsidiaries' work. Chinasoft (headquartered in Beijing) and Xinhua were among the first Chinese- owned IT companies. Later, such Chinese-owned IT companies as iSoftStone (Beijing), New Touch (Shanghai) and Nantian (Shenzhen) also came. See also \\"Dalian Software Park Phase 2\\" below. Current status Currently, there are more than 380 companies in Dalian Software Park (a September 2006 survey by Dalian Software Park): *58% Domestic Chinese companies *42% Overseas companies **27% Japanese companies **15% Other Overseas companies (American, European, Korean, Taiwan. Korean, etc.) Workforce The IT service work done in Dalian Software Park can be categorized as follows (A 2006 survey by Dalian Software Park): *40% Application software development *30% Business process outsourcing *10% Embedded software development *20% Other, such as Drawing, IC or Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design, R&D; and Animation/Video Games Application development is done mostly by the engineering school graduates of the universities, while embedded software development requires more technical skills in the areas, such as telecommunications or special hardware. Those workers involved in BPO varies from the middle school graduates for data entry, to the foreign language school graduates for simpler BPO work, and the returnees of overseas studies for inbound or outbound call center/contact center work. To emphasize the importance of information privacy, Dalian City Software Industry Association has recently implemented, in cooperation with Japan Information Processing Development Corporation (JIPDEC), a citywide PIPA (Privacy Information Protection Assessment) program. Dalian Geography Dalian City is located in the southern tip of China's northeast region. It is surrounded on the three sides by the Yellow and Bohai Seas, and is known for a relatively mild climate in this region with otherwise severe winter. Dalian has a metropolitan population of about 6 million. It is the most developed city in the northeast region. IT Capability and Linguistic Ability Most of the IT workers come from the engineering schools of the universities in Dalian and other cities in Northeast China. In Dalian, there are Dalian University of Technology, Dalian Jiaotong University, Dalian Maritime University, and Neusoft Institute of Information which is within the Park. In other cities, there are Northeast University in Shenyang, Jilin University in Changchun, and Harbin Industrial University in Harbin. Workers with English ability come from the various universities where English is predominantly their first foreign language, but they lack the experience of the Indian university graduates with working knowledge of English. There are also the English-speaking returnees of study abroad, typically from U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain. French speaking workers are from Dalian University of Foreign Languages (DLUFL, 100 graduates each year), Liaoning Normal University (LNNU, 30 graduates each year) or the returnees of study abroad, typically in France and Quebec, Canada. L'Alliance française, France's worldwide network of French language education, is located at DLUFL. Dalian is particularly unique in the fact that there are many workers with Japanese language ability for the following historical reasons: * The southern half of the present-day Dalian City was a Japanese occupied territory, 1905–1945 * Dalian University of Foreign Language was established in 1963 as the center of Japanese studies in China. * Since the late 1980s, many Japanese companies have established manufacturing subsidiaries and have been employing Japanese speaking Chinese. Another factor contributing to the Japanese language capability in Dalian is the presence of about two million ethnic Koreans, most of whom live in the Northeast. Culturally and linguistically, China's ethnic Koreans are nearly identical to the people in South Korea. Subsequently, they are capable of learning and speaking Japanese with ease. Preferential Policies The Dalian municipal government offers generous tax exemptions and subsidies such as corporate income tax exemption during the first two years of business establishment and 50 percent tax reduction in the following three years. After this five-year period, the Dalian municipal government will offer a reduced tax rate of 15% rather than the usual 25% for high-tech companies. The preferential policy of Dalian City can be summarized in the following points: *The university graduates who have sought high-tech jobs are given the Dalian City residency rights *Since 2004, the software development companies in Dalian Software Park or Dalian High-Tech Park are allowed to pay reduced amount of contribution to the retirement funds (allowance) *The employees of such companies in such locations are given income tax reduction Transportation See here for details.

She bore a Portuguese flag of convenience, possibly out of Macau and had a Portuguese captain, João de Barros Andrade, but had the Englishman Robert Duffin on board as supercargo (owner and manager of the ship's cargo and trade). Duffin was an associate of John Meares who had organized a number of British fur trading expeditions using the Portuguese flag in order to evade paying for trading licenses from the East India Company. It is probable that Duffin was actually in command of the vessel.Sea otter fur traders , John Robson The Fenis and St. Joseph spent part of the summer of 1792 in the Queen Charlotte Islands, trading with the indigenous people for sea otter pelts. On 12 August 1792 , under Robert Haswell, encountered Fenis and St. Joseph near Masset. In mid-September, having gathered about 700 sea otter pelts, Fenis and St. Joseph arrived at Nootka Sound. At the time, diplomatic discussions taking place between George Vancouver and Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra over how to carry out the First Nootka Convention resulting from the Nootka Crisis of 1789. Since Duffin had been at Nootka Sound with Meares in 1788 and with James Colnett in 1789-- both key moments of the Nootka Crisis--Vancouver quickly asked him for a sworn statement about the events of 1789 at Nootka Sound. Duffin's report contradicted the reports of Robert Gray and Joseph Ingraham, which Bodega y Quadra had been using to undermine Vancouver's diplomatic position. Where Gray and Ingraham swore that Meares had never purchased any land from the local indigenous chief Maquinna, Duffin said Meares had in fact purchased the whole of Friendly Cove. The point was central to whether Bodega y Quadra would or would not turn over the Spanish settlement at Nootka Sound to Vancouver. Vancouver seems to have had doubts about the veracity of Duffin's account, but confronted Bodega with the new information. Bodega dismissed it, claiming that Duffin could not be objective on the matter. In response to Vancouver's use of Duffin's sworn statements Bodega sought a formal statement from Maquinna, from whom Meares had supposedly made the land purchase. Maquinna came before a group assembled at Bodega's house, including Barros Andrade, the captain of the San José el Fénix (Fenis and St. Joseph), and a number of others, all of whom were to serve as witnesses for an affidavit. Before this group Maquinna flatly denied selling Meares any land. He had only sold a bit of land in Marvinas Bay to the American John Kendrick and he had donated the land at Friendly Cove to Francisco de Eliza, where the Spanish settlement then stood, on the condition that the land be returned when the Spanish withdrew. Between the statements of Duffin and Maquinna the negotiations between Vancouver and Bodega reached a complete deadlock. The Fenis and St. Joseph played an important part in the Vancouver Expedition. The brig left Nootka Sound on 1 October 1792, sailing for China and carrying Vancouver's lieutenant Zachary Mudge, with copies of journals, charts, and logs, as well as reports from Vancouver to the British government regarding the diplomatic impasse that had developed. On 28 October 1792 the brig encountered the Columbia Rediviva at sea. The two vessels and their commanders met again in the Hawaiian Islands, where Captain Haswell personally met Mudge. After meeting Haswell the ship made for Macao, where Mudge disembarked. From Macao, the Fenis and St. Joseph made her way to Madras under a new master, Moore, arriving in April 1793.The Calcutta Gazette, 4 April 1793 Mudge took passage from Canton on the East Indiaman Lord Macartney in January 1793, arriving in England in June .The London Chronicle, 11 June 1793 The Fenis and St. Josephdid not return to the Pacific coast.

He is referred to as \\"son of God\\" in the Testament of Ba. He was the second of five brothers. The eldest, Prince Tsangma (), took Buddhist vows. The third, Langdarma, who was anti-Buddhist and ruled after the death of Ralpacan, is referred to in the sources as \\"unfit to reign\\". The younger two brothers both died young., p. 17 Ralpacan is considered very important to the history of Tibetan Buddhism as one of the three Dharma Kings (chosgyal) — Songtsen Gampo, Trisong Detsen, and himself — who brought Buddhism to Tibet. Trisong had five wives, all from Tibetan noble families.Stein, R. A. (1972) Tibetan Civilization, p. 63. Stanford University Press. (cloth); (pbk) Political activities The Tibetan Empire reached its greatest extent under his rule, and included parts of China, India, Nepal, the Kingdom of Khotan, Balti, Bruzha (Gilgit and Hunza), Zhangzhung, Hor-yul, Sog- yul, Yugur, and Kamilog (roughly equivalent to present-day Sichuan), as well as almost all of modern Xinjiang and Gansu.Kolmaš, Josef.

Ralpacan's power was aided by the able military leadership of Zhang 'Bro sTag. In 810 Emperor Xianzong of Tang wrote asking for the return of three prefectures. In 816 Zhang 'Bro sTag led a raid led to within two days journey from the Uyghur capital at Ordu-Baliq.

Tibetans attacked Uyghur territory in 816 and were in turn attacked in 821. After troops were sent towards the Chinese border, Buddhists in both countries sought mediation and the Sino-Tibetan treaty completed in 821/822, which insured peace for more than two decades. Tibet also made peace with the Uyghurs and also, apparently, with the Kingdom of Nanzhao in 822.Beckwith, Christopher I. The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia. (1987), pp. 150-151.

Culture and Buddhism Ralpacan was a generous supporter of Buddhism and invited many craftsmen, scholars and translators to Tibet from China, Nepal, Kashmir and the Kingdom of Khotan. He also promoted the development of Tibetan literature and translations, which were greatly aided by the development of a detailed Sanskrit-Tibetan lexicon, Mahāvyutpatti, which included standard Tibetan equivalents for thousands of Sanskrit terms.Ancient Tibet: Research Materials from the Yeshe De Project (1986), pp. 296-297. Dharma Publishing, California. . He decreed that all translations must be done directly from Sanskrit.Yoshinori Takeuchi, Jan van Bragt. Buddhist Spirituality. Crossroad, 1993. p. 225. Ralpacan was considered to be an emanation of Vajrapani and encouraged Indian and Tibetan scholars to translate the Tripiṭaka, the Commentaries, and ancient Tantras into the Tibetan language.Tantric Glossary During his reign, and even after his death into the 840s, thousands of copies of the Aparimitāyurnāma sūtra (Sūtra of Immeasurable Light), as well as hundreds of copies of the Śatasahasrikaprajñāpāramitāsūtra and the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra (Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra) were produced as offerings to Ralpacan. Ralpacan built a magnificent nine-story stone temple of 'U shang near the confluence of the Tsangpo and Kyi Rivers. The lower stories were of stone, the three middle ones of brick and the top three of wood. It was famous for its remarkable golden roof. On the top floors, he stored Buddhist scriptures, stupas and images, while the middle floors were used by scholars and translators, and the bottom floors by the court and for state affairs. He also remodeled and restored older temples.Dás, Sarat Chandra. Contributions on the Religion and History of Tibet, p. 40. Manjushri Publishing House, Delhi (1970). First published in The Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. L (1881) He introduced standard weights and measures based on the ones in China. He enforced the Indian canonical regulations for the clergy and organised many classes of priesthood, assigning a revenue from seven families for each Buddhist monk and proscribed strict penalties for anyone showing disrespect to them. His royal summer camp near modern Lhasa was \\"a palatial military pavilion\\", \\"wonderfully decorated with golden figures of tigers, panthers, and dragons.\\"Ancient Tibet: Research Materials from the Yeshe De Project (1986), p. 296.

Death and succession Chongye Valleyalt=297x297px Ralpacan was, according to the most common Tibetan tradition, murdered by two pro-Bon ministers who then placed his anti-Buddhist brother, Langdarma, on the throne.Shakabpa, Tsepon W. D. (1967). Tibet: A Political History, p. 51. Yale University Press, New Haven & London. Some accounts suggest that his death was an accident due to a slip on the steps of the temple of Maldro, while the Old Book of Tang state that he became sick and was unable to take control of affairs of state and then, later, died.Pelliot, Paul. Histoire Ancienne du Tibet. Paris. Libraire d'amérique et d'orient. 1961, p. 133. The latter theory finds support in a damaged manuscript from Dunhuang containing a prayer for the good health of the king.Richardson, H. E. \\"Khri Gtsug-lde-brtsan's Illness.\\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 44 (1981), p. 351-352. The late Chinese work, the Tongjiangangmu by Zhu Xi (1130–1200), claims that Ralpacan had been sick for almost the whole of his reign and had, therefore, been unable to travel around his empire. He is said to have died at the end of the year 838.Grosier, Jean-Baptiste. Histoire Général de la Chine ou Annales de cet empire: traduites du Tong-kien-kang-mu. (1778) Paris.

It is possible that it was this epidemic which brought about Ralpacan's death, though it could equally have been the result of his chronic illness.

How, \\"Contributions to the Mineralogy of Nova Scotia, Pt. III, Borates and Other Minerals in Anhydrite and Gypsum,\\" Philosophical Magazine, January 1868Ramik, Robert A., \\"Lost and Found: one of Canada's earliest type mineral localities\\", The 32nd Rochester Mineralogical Symposium, Program and abstracts, Rochester, New York, April 14–17, 2005. How was alerted to the unknown mineral by miners in a gypsum quarry, who found it to be a nuisance. He called the new mineral silico-boro-calcite; it was given the name howlite by James Dwight Dana shortly thereafter. Geology The most common form of howlite is irregular nodules, sometimes resembling cauliflower. Crystals of howlite are rare, having been found in only a couple localities worldwide. Crystals were first reported from Tick Canyon in the Sierra Pelona Mountains of California,Murdoch, J., \\"Crystallography and X-ray measurement of howlite from California\\", American Mineralogist, 42, 521-524, 1957. and later at Iona, Nova Scotia. Crystals reach a maximum size of about one centimeter. The nodules are white with fine grey or black veins in an erratic, often web-like pattern, opaque with a sub-vitreous luster. The crystals at Iona are colorless, white or brown and are often translucent or transparent. Its structure is monoclinic with a Mohs hardness of 3.5 and lacks regular cleavage. Crystals are prismatic and flattened on {100}. The crystals from Tick Canyon are elongated along the 010 axis, while those from Iona are elongated along the 001 axis. Jewelry Howlite is commonly used to make decorative objects such as small carvings or jewelry components. Because of its porous texture, howlite can be easily dyed to imitate other minerals, especially turquoise because of the superficial similarity of the veining patterns. Howlite is also sold in its natural state, sometimes under the trade names of \\"white turquoise\\" or \\"white buffalo turquoise,\\" or the derived name \\"white buffalo stone\\" and is used to produce jewelry similar to how turquoise is used. Varieties of the unrelated gemstone turquoise which are white instead of the typical blue or green color have been mined in the US States of Arizona and Nevada, and are also marketed as \\"white buffalo turquoise\\". Most of the white varieties of turquoise are chalk-like with a Mohs hardness of 1, and are not as hard or durable as howlite, and subsequently require stabilization in order to be used in jewelry, which has resulted in howlite being more popular for use in jewelry than the artificially stabilized white forms of the mineral turquoise..

A: original sedimentary rock; B: pencil cleavage; C: diagenetic foliation (parallel to bedding); D: slaty cleavage. Cleavage, in structural geology and petrology, describes a type of planar rock feature that develops as a result of deformation and metamorphism.Passchier, C.W, & Trouw, R.A.J. 2005, Microtectonics, Springer, 366pp. The degree of deformation and metamorphism along with rock type determines the kind of cleavage feature that develops. Generally these structures are formed in fine grained rocks composed of minerals affected by pressure solution. Cleavage is a type of rock foliation, a fabric element that describes the way planar features develop in a rock. Foliation is separated into two groups: primary and secondary. Primary deals with igneous and sedimentary rocks while secondary deals with rocks that undergo metamorphism as a result of deformation. Cleavage is a type of secondary foliation associated with fine grained rocks. For coarser grained rocks, schistosity is used to describe secondary foliation. There is a variety of definitions for cleavage which may cause confusion and debate. The terminology used in this article is based largely on Passchier and Trouw (2005). They state that cleavage is a type of secondary foliation in fine grained rocks characterized by planar fabric elements that form in a preferred orientation. Some authors choose to use cleavage when describing any form of secondary foliation. Types of cleavage Schematic drawing of continuous and spaced cleavage The presence of fabric elements such as preferred orientation of platy or elongate minerals, compositional layering, grain size variations, etc. determines what type of cleavage forms. Cleavage is categorized as either continuous or spaced. Continuous cleavage Metamorphosed shale depicting slaty cleavage. Note the grains of mica, quartz, and ilmenite aligned with a preferred orientation. Continuous or penetrative cleavage describes fine grained rocks consisting of platy minerals evenly distributed in a preferred orientation. The type of continuous cleavage that forms depends on the minerals present. Undeformed platy minerals such as micas and amphiboles align in a preferred orientation, and minerals such as quartz or calcite deform into a grain shape preferred orientation. Continuous cleavage is scale dependent, so a rock with a continuous cleavage on a microscopic level could show signs of spaced cleavage when observed on a macroscopic level. =Slaty cleavage= Since the nature of cleavage is dependent on scale, slaty cleavage is defined as having 0.01 mm or less of space occurring between layers. Slaty cleavage often occurs after diagenesis and is the first cleavage feature to form after deformation begins. The tectonic strain must be enough to allow a new strong foliation to form, i.e. slaty cleavage. Spaced cleavage A thin section depicting spaced cleavage. The cleavage domains are darker biotite grains, and the microlithons between consist of mostly muscovite and quartz. The grains in the microlithons are starting to align in a preferred orientation. A new foliation overprinted an old, showing the beginning signs of a crenulation cleavage. Spaced Cleavage occurs in rocks with minerals that are not evenly distributed and as a result the rock forms discontinuous layers or lenses of different types of minerals. Spaced cleavage contains two types of domains; cleavage domains and microlithons. Cleavage domains are planar boundaries subparallel to the trend of the domain, and microlithons are bounded by the cleavage domains. Spaced cleavages can be categorized based on whether the grains inside the microlithons are randomly oriented or contain microfolds from a previous foliation fabric. Other descriptions for spaced cleavages include the spacing size, the shape and percentage of cleavage domains, and the transition between cleavage domains and microlithons. =Crenulation cleavage= Crenulation cleavage contains microlithons that were warped by a previous foliation. Folding occurs when there are multiple phases of deformation, the latter one causes symmetric or asymmetric microfolds that deform previous foliations. The type of crenulation cleavage pattern that forms depends on lithology and degree of deformation and metamorphism. =Disjunctive cleavage= Disjunctive cleavage describes a type of spaced cleavage where the microlithons are not deformed into microfolds, and formation is independent from any previous foliation present in the rock. Report of IUGS sub-commission on the systematics of metamorphic rocks. A common outdated term for disjunctive cleavage is fracture cleavage. It is recommended that this term be avoided because of the tendency to misinterpret the formation of a cleavage feature. Transposition cleavage When an older cleavage foliation is erased and replaced by a younger foliation due to stronger deformation and is evidence for multiple deformation events. Formation The development of cleavage foliation involves a combination of various mechanisms dependent on the rocks composition, tectonic processes, and metamorphic conditions. The magnitude and orientation of stress coupled with pressure and temperature conditions determine how a mineral is deformed. Cleavages form approximately parallel to the X-Y plane of tectonic strain and are categorized based on the type of strain. The mechanisms currently believed to control cleavage formation are rotation of mineral grains, solution transfer, dynamic recrystallization, and static recrystallization. Mechanical rotation of grains During ductile deformation, mineral grains with a high aspect ratio are likely to rotate so that their mean orientation is in the same direction as the XY plane of finite strain. Mineral grains may fold if oriented perpendicular to shortening direction. Solution transfer Cleavage foliations may result due to stress-induced solution transfer by the redistribution of inequant mineral grains by pressure solution and recrystallization. This would also help to increase rotation of elongate and tabular mineral grains. Mica grains undergoing solution transfer will align in a preferred orientation. If the minerals grains affected by pressure solution are deformed through plastic crystal processes, the grain will be extended along the XY-plane of finite strain. This process shapes grains into a preferred orientation Dynamic recrystallization Dynamic recrystallization occurs when a rock undergoes metamorphic conditions and reequilibrium of a minerals chemical composition. This happens when there is a decrease in free energy stored in deformed grains. Deformed micas can store a sufficient amount of strain energy that can allow recrystallization to occur. This process allows oriented regrowth of both old and new minerals into the damaged crystal lattice during cleavage development. Static recrystallization This process occurs either after deformation or in the absence of dynamic deformation. Depending on the intensity of heat during recrystallization, the foliation will either be strengthened or weakened. If the heat is too intense, foliation will be weakened due to the nucleation and growth of new randomly oriented crystals and the rock will become a hornfels. If minimal heat is applied to a rock with a preexisting foliation and without a change in mineral assemblage, the cleavage will be strengthened by growth of micas parallel to foliation. Relationship to folds Anticline in sandstone shale sequences with axial planar cleavage, refraction of cleavage visible on right-hand limb Cleavages display a measurable geometric relationship with the axial plane of folds developed during deformation and is referred to as axial planar foliations. The foliations are symmetrically arranged with respect to the axial plane depending on the composition and competency of a rock. For example, when mixed sandstone and mudstone sequences are folded during very- low to low grade metamorphism, cleavage forms parallel to the fold axial plane, particularly in the clay-rich parts of the sequence. In folded alternations of sandstone and mudstone the cleavage has a fan-like arrangement, divergent in the mudstone layers and convergent in the sandstones. This is thought to be because the folding is controlled by buckling of the stronger sandstone beds with the weaker mudstones deforming to fill the intervening gaps.Price, N.J., Cosgrove, J.W., 1990, Analysis of geological structures, Cambridge University Press, 507pp. The result is a feature referred to as foliation fanning. Engineering considerations In geotechnical engineering a cleavage plane forms a discontinuity that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of rock masses in, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope construction.

He was the primary reason for the construction of the five-gated wall that surrounds the city of Harar. He was known for marrying the widow of his uncle Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (also known as Ahmed Gurey and Ahmad Gragn), he also succeeded Imam Ahmad as leader of the Muslim forces fighting Christian Ethiopia.R.Basset (editor), Histoire de la conquete de l’Abyssinie (History of the Conquest of Abyssinia), Paris, 1897–1901 Biography Considered a saint from Harar, Mujahid was called the Sahib al-Fath al-Thani, or \\"Master of the Second Conquest\\". When Imam Ahmad, who had led the Muslim conquest of the Ethiopian Highlands, was killed in 1543, the Muslim forces fell back in confusion to Harar. Nur, the dead leader’s sister’s son, married Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi's firebrand widow, Bati del Wambara, and undertook to renew the fortunes of the Muslim city, which had been sacked in 1550. Promoted to Emir around 1550-51, he spent the next two years reorganizing his forces, and constructing the defensive wall which still surrounds the city.Dr. E. Cerulli, Documenti arabi per la storia dell’Ethiopia, Memoria della Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Vol. 4, No. 2, Rome, 1931 In 1554-55, Nur departed on a Jihad (holy war), in the eastern Ethiopian lowlands of Bale, and Hadiya. In 1559, he invaded Fatagar, where he fought against the Ethiopian emperor Galawdewos, and killed him in battle. Nur continued fighting for 12 years until, according to legend, at Gibe he said \\"Kaffa!\\", or \\"Enough!\\", and returned to Harar. Some believe the province is called Kaffa for this reason. During Nur’s absence, Harar witnessed internal power struggles, and the unlucky city was disturbed by encroaching Oromo clans. It was at this time that the walls of Harar were built; tradition attributes them to Nur ibn Mujahid with the help of two chiefs, Aw Abadir and Aw 'Ali. By 1567, repeated Oromo raids had brought famine to the city. Nur left the city for three months on a punitive raid against the invaders. On his return he found an epidemic afflicting Harar, and he himself died of typhus that year.Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopian Borderlands (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 373 Legacy The grave Contemporaries described Nur as a man of noble conduct, who was just, strong, and highly principled. Besides the wall which protected the city's inhabitants from invaders over the following centuries, he was noted for a number of buildings he erected in Harar. His tomb stands on a hill surrounded by houses and courtyards, and is a popular place of pilgrimage in Harar.

As both the coconut and the rice-plant are commonly found in the tropics all-around the world, coconut rice too is found in many cultures throughout the world, spanning across the equator from the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, South America, Central America, East Africa, and Caribbean. Southeast Asia=Burma In Burmese cuisine, ohn htamin (), as rice cooked with coconut milk is called, is a ceremonial staple food, often eaten in lieu of plain white rice. In the most basic version of ohn htamin, rice is cooked with a base of coconut milk, along with fried shallots and salt, adding to the rice's savory and rich flavours. Ohn htamin is commonly paired with Burmese-style sibyan curries. Indonesia The rice cooked in coconut milk is actually quite common in Indonesia, with each region developed their own version of it. In Indonesia, plain coconut rice is usually made from white rice, coconut milk, ginger, fenugreek seed, lemongrass and pandan leaves. The most common coconut rice recipe in Indonesia is nasi uduk from Jakarta. Another coconut milk rice recipes includes nasi gurih from Aceh and Javanese nasi liwet. Nasi kuning is Indonesian yellow rice which is quite similar to coconut rice with addition of turmeric as coloring and flavoring agent. Another similar coconut rice recipe are rice dumplings with thicker texture, such as burasa from Makassar and lemang popular in Minangkabau. Malaysia Nasi lemak (coconut milk and pandan leaf) is the most popular coconut rice recipe in Malaysia. It is considered a national dish of Malaysia. Thailand In Thai cuisine, sweet coconut rice is very popular as a dessert or sweet snack. It is made with glutinous rice, coconut milk, sugar, salt and water and most famously paired with slices of ripe mango and an additional dollop of coconut cream. Outside of the mango season, it will also be eaten with other fruits or semi-sweet dishes. Other popular coconut rice desserts are khao tom mat, where sweet banana is steamed inside sticky rice while wrapped in a banana leaf, khao lam, where the rice and coconut milk mixture is steamed inside a section of bamboo, and khao niao kaeo, a very sweet dessert of glutinous rice, coconut milk, and large amounts of sugar, and most often pink or green in color. Indian subcontinent=India In India, coconut rice (: కొబ్బరి అన్నం Telugu, ಕಾಯಿ ಅನ್ನಂ Kannada ) famous in the southern regions. In India, coconut rice usually made from basmati rice with mild coconut flavours acquired from coconut milk, and commonly served with curries. It is made with coconut flakes (or grated or desiccated/dry coconut). One way to make this dish is to make the rice separately (preferably using a rice variety which is light and fluffy when cooked) and then mixing it with the coconut mixture (coconut flakes toasted in sesame/coconut oil and spiced with paprika, nuts, curry powder/leaves, and other spices). Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, coconut rice is often referred to as \\"milk rice\\" or kiribath. It is widely served across the nation on special occasions to mark the auspicious timings or moments. It is accompanied by lunu miris a spicy onion sambol ground with red chilli, onions, tomato, lime and salt with umbalakada. Latin America=Colombia and Panama Coconut rice with fried fish and tostones, served in Panama City. On the Caribbean coast of Colombia and Panama, arroz con coco is a typical side dish for fish. It is made with white rice cooked in a base of coconut milk and combined with shredded coconut meat, water, salt, raisins (optional), and sugar. Honduras In the Caribbean coast of Honduras, rice is traditionally cooked with coconut oil, coconut milk, garlic, onions and red or black beans, a hearty dish known as \\"rice and beans\\". This plate is especially popular among Hondurans of African ancestry (Garifuna), but like many other Garifuna plates and foods with African influence, it is popular among all Hondurans and regarded as a typical Honduran food by Hondurans of all racial backgrounds. Puerto Rico In Puerto Rico coconut rice is usually served with fish and sweet plantains. The rice is sautéed with coconut oil and salt, shredded coconut and coconut milk are then added with the option of garlic, onions, cilantro, raisins, and kumquats. The rice is then coved with a banana leaf during the cooking process. Another popular coconut rice dish is arroz con dulce (coconut rice pudding) a dessert made with milk, coconut milk, coconut cream, raisins, vanilla, rum, sugar, ginger, and spice. Puerto Rican rice pudding is popular in Colombia, Cuba, and Venezuela.  Africa = Nigeria  In Nigeria, coconut rice is made by cooking rice in the juice of shredded coconut flesh. The shredded coconut flesh is steeped in hot water and then drained to give \\"milk.\\" The milk can be added to a tomato base, such as that used for jollof rice, or cooked on its own with the rice.

Later, she studied abroad in Madrid, Spain, receiving her M.A. in Spanish and Hispanic Literature. In the following years she taught in Brooklyn and the Bronx until moving to Massachusetts and receiving her doctorate in curriculum studies with concentrations in multicultural and bilingual education, from the University of Massachusetts in 1979.Personal website In May 2017, Nieto delivered the commencement address for the Graduate School of Education at St. John's University in New York City, where she reflected on her life work and her undergraduate days at St. John's.  About her work  In Nieto's book Affirming Diversity: The Sociopolitical Context of Multicultural Education (the fifth edition of which is co-authored by Patty Bode), Nieto takes an in- depth look into public school systems and describes how they fail to serve many students, particularly children of color and those who live in poverty. Her text often describes structural flaws in the education system and how to challenge them in the classroom. Her work can be regarded as a reference for teachers in a multicultural environment. Affirming Diversity also includes multiple case studies of students of various sociocultural backgrounds so that teachers can learn from the voices and experiences of young people themselves. This resource can prove to be invaluable in a classroom setting. Nieto's work seeks to shed light on common institutional policies and practices (racism, inequality, discrimination, and other forms of exclusion) in multicultural learning environments and to show teachers how to effectively confront these challenges. According to her, institutional policies and practices that jeopardize student learning are evident at many different levels: negative societal ideologies, inequitable power relationships, rigid national policies, unresponsive school districts, and even the biases and beliefs of teachers themselves. Her books also offer activities both in the classroom and out that the teacher can engage in with students, colleagues, and community members to provide a better learning environment. These activities usually seek to bring about positive change in the school, the community, and inside oneself. Her book also offers web resources for a multimedia learning experience.

Cable railing on residential deck overlooking a Lake Uses Cable railings are often desired in place of traditional pickets to achieve nearly unobstructed views as the cable is much thinner than traditional pickets. It is also a more modern aesthetic and is often chosen for that reason. You can install cable assemblies into an existing railing system (called cable infill ) and eliminate many of the maintenance headaches. Posts construction Due to the excessive load requirements of this type of railing system, post construction is critical to the success of cable railings. Cable railing requires very rigid frames compared to many other types of railings due to the forces applied to the end posts by tensioning the cables. Cables must be tensioned to provide minimum cable deflection using 4-inch sphere, to satisfy building code requirements. Manufacturers use different methods to achieve the same result, one manufacturer uses a thicker wall and a webbed post in their aluminum systems, while using only thicker side walls in their stainless systems. Common frame types are constructed of steel, stainless steel, extruded aluminum or wood. Posts height The total minimum height required varies per building codes depending on the area and target use of either residential or commercial. Local city codes supersede state, national and international code. In most states, the residential code is 36 inches high. There are some exceptions, though, like in California the required height for residential railing is 42 inches. On the other hand, the commercial International Building Code requires the railing to be at a minimum of 42-inch height. Posts can be floor-mounted or fascia/side-mounted, but the height of the railing is measured from the floor to the top of the railing. Fascia mounted cable- railings at 42-inch height Spacing between the cables The nationwide construction code requires that any opening should be less than 4 inches, and no 4-inch sphere should pass. In cable railing the target opening is usually less than inches, taking into account the cable’s deflection when a 4-inch ball is forced to go through the cables. In order to meet this requirement, typically the number of parallel cables for 36-inch-high railing is 10, and 12 for 42-inch-high railing for floor-mounted posts. Cables and tensioning Cable is very strong in tensile strength, with a breaking strength in excess of 1000 lbs for these types of uses, and is a suitable in-fill material for a railing (\\"guard\\" in ICC codes). Typical diameters are 1/8\\", 3/16\\" for residential and 3/16\\" and 1/4\\" for commercial applications. There are many different types cable and strand (also referred to as wire rope). Cable and strand is available in galvanized carbon steel, type 304 stainless steel, or the highly corrosion resistant, type 316 stainless steel (best for coastal areas). The most common cable construction is 1x19 type construction strand, which is 19 cables twisted in a single bundle, whereas for example, 7x7 would be 7 cable bundles of 7 cables twisted. This type of stainless strand is designed to have limited stretch, as compared to galvanized, making it a good long term cable railing solution. It has long been used for yacht stays and guy wires, proving its outdoor durability and strength. Cable flexibility Cable flexibility is an important consideration in designing a cable railing. The old UBC (Uniform Building Code) and newer ICC (IBC and IRC) codes state that a 4” sphere shall not pass through any portion of a barrier on a guardrail. In a horizontal or vertical cable rail, the cables, once tensioned must be rigid enough to prevent a 4-inch sphere passing through it. Factors influencing this rigidity are: the tension of the cable, intermediate posts (or cable spacers) spacing, the diameter of the cable, top rail cap material and the cable to cable spacing. The application of the 4\\" sphere test is usually at the discretion of a code enforcement official who will interpret the force behind the 4\\" sphere so it is advised that cable spacing not be more than 3\\" over a 48\\" space between post. Cable tension: An incredible amount of tension is generated on the end posts when ten or more cables, each tensioned at 200-400 lbs. over a height of 36\\" to 42” exists. Underestimating the tension of cables applied to end poles can cause a safety hazard. Cable can have too much deflection allowing body parts to slip through, or cables can merely \\"pull out\\" of the end fittings, causing the cable rail to fail. Poorly designed end posts will result in a railing where the cables cannot be properly tensioned without an unacceptable amount of cable deflection. End posts to which the tensioning hardware attaches must be constructed so that they will not deflect perceptibly. Post spacing: Intermediate posts are posts which provide mounting for the top rail and have a vertical row of holes to support the cable as it passes through them. Since the post to post spacing is a primary driver of cable rigidity, the post to post spacing is very important. It is generally recommended that post spacing be no more than 5 ft on center Some manufacturers require as little as no more than 3 ft on center. The reason for post spacing is more about the cable end fittings' machine thread loading capacity (how much tension can be put on the threads before they fail), than anything else. The more cable drop in the middle, the more weight on the tensioning device, ergo the more load on the threads. Proof strength must be greater than load. Cable diameter and properties: The next variable is the diameter of the cable. Cables can be any wire rope, which meets load strength requirements by the ICC. The most available types are 1x19 1/8\\", 1 x 19 5/32\\", 1x19 3/16\\", 7x7 3/16\\" and 1x19 1/4\\". 1 x 19 cable is the most rigid cable available and per the first paragraph above will have greater resistance to the 4\\" sphere test and likewise have a lesser chance of allowing objects 4\\" and over to slip through the cable. 316 Stainless Steel is preferred, due to its inherent nature against stretching, keeping long term maintenance down, as well as having anti-corrosive properties. Top rail: Top rail material must be strong as it is being compressed by the combined cable forces. Common top cap materials are the stronger species of wood or metal. Composite lumber can be used if a support rail is used along with it. The support rail is used between the posts to lend strength to the system, both between the posts, and to the Top Rail. Cable to cable spacing: Spacing of the cables vertically is critical to minimize deflection of the cables. Most manufacturers recommended maximum vertical spacing of no more than 3-inch free opening between cables when they are installed to meet cable deflection requirements as stated above. All of the above factors work together to minimize the deflection of the cable to prevent a 4” sphere from passing between the cables when they are properly tensioned in a well-designed frame. This is a requirement according to a number of building codes. Among the more stringent, including that of California, this requirement may be used in conjunction with a weight being hung from the cable. Cable end fittings Cable end fittings are the pieces that tie the system together. The cable attaches into one side of the fitting, while the other side attaches to the post (frame structure). Cable ends may tension, or just attach to the frame, depending on the individual needs of the project. The requirements needed to decide whether to use tensioning or non-tensioning fittings are generally dependent upon the manufacturer's system requirements, your local building codes, and ICC requirements. To determine the type of cable end fittings needed, you'll need to know the distance you expect a single piece of cable to run without stopping, and the amount of tensioning ability of the fitting you expect to use. Individual manufacturers will help you to determine the rest. Most cable end fittings are made by type 316 stainless steel to avoid rust.

The residence was the winter home of the American circus owner, developer and art collector John Ringling and his wife Mable. Description and history Bay front façade of Ca' d'Zan The Ringlings were lovers of the Venetian aesthetic and chose the site overlooking Sarasota Bay for its vista, which reminded them of the lagoon of their favorite city. The name of the residence is Venetian for House of John. The Ringlings had been renting the residence of Mary Louise and Charles N. Thompson on their extensive Shell Beach parcel, and decided to purchase some of the land to build a permanent winter headquarters that would include a residence on the bay and a museum for their extensive art and artifact collection. An art school was planned to abut the museum, but it never was built. Mable's rose garden was the first completed portion of the complex. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed Ca' d'Zan, the Residence of John and Mable Ringling on its list, Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places. Architectural details of the house reflect influences ranging from the Venetian Doge's Palace, Ca' d'Oro and the Grunwald Hotel. Items collected by the couple during their international travels were featured in the residence. The design of the residence was commissioned from New York architect Dwight James Baum in 1924 and it was built by the Sarasota developer Owen Burns. The work was completed in 1926, as the Florida boom collapsed and the bank failures that would lead to the crash of 1929 began. The original cost to build the home was $1.5 million. In 1982, the residence was listed as a contributing property to the Caples'-Ringlings' Estates Historic District, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Other contributing properties in the district include the Ellen and Ralph Caples residence, the John and Mable Ringling Museum, the Hester Ringling Lancaster Sandford residence, and the Edith and Charles Ringling residence. The 1998 film Great Expectations, directed by Alfonso Cuarón, had portions filmed at Ca' d'Zan, which served as Ms. Dinsmoor's house, Paradiso Perduto. The residence was restored in 2002 under the direction of Bill Puig. Most details of the original construction and decoration were restored faithfully, except some of the interior color schemes.

Plot Jenna (McGregor) is a teenaged competitive skater who has been coached by her overprotective, high-strung, gun-obsessed mother Celia (De Mornay). When she quits competing and decides to go to college in Vancouver, her mother becomes very upset and tries to prevent her from leaving home; eventually locking her in a hot sauna until Jenna agrees to stay. Her father gives Jenna money behind her mother's back in order to help Jenna leave home. Her mother goes to Canada to force her to come back home. Once there, the mother becomes increasing unstable as she first tries to bring a handgun into Canada, tries to procure one from a drug dealer, and finally has sex with a policeman who gets a gun for her. After Jenna brings her father to Vancouver to fly her mother home that day, the mother instead insists, against Jenna's protests, that she will drive herself back. The father leaves and that night the mother breaks into Jenna's apartment and forces her to pack and drive home by gun point. Before they get out of Canada, the mother fires a warning shot at an overly- persistent squeegee man who, after cleaning the car windshield, is looking for some form of payment. Shaking, she orders Jenna to stop driving and runs into a tunnel in a park where she pulls the gun out and begs Jenna to shoot her. A struggle ensues over the gun with the mother getting a grazed in the head, knocking her off of her feet. As Jenna cradles her, Celia acknowledges to Jenna that she must let her go.

TSN mainly distributes news and agriculture business to more than 130 AM and FM radio affiliates across Texas. History The Texas State Network was founded in 1938 by presidential son Elliott Roosevelt, who was loaned money by the oil magnate Sid Richardson to eventually buy a dozen stations (many are still affiliates) that formed the Texas State Network. TSN began transmitting five weeks after its incorporation date, with a broadcast originating from the old Casa Mañana in Fort Worth, and featured such personalities as Bob Hope and Texas Governor James Allred, along with a 300-voice choir. The network’s original programming included soap operas such as Uncle Jeremiah and The Adventures of Gary and Jill. As is the case today, most of TSN's early programming was devoted to news and sports. Nearly 30 network announcers, production personnel and control room operators produced Highlights in the World News daily. The first baseball broadcasts on TSN were of the Fort Worth Cats, with announcer Zack Hurt, calling the play-by-play. Studios TSN studios have moved around over the years. It began at 1308 Lancaster in Fort Worth. It moved in the mid-1950s to 4801 west Freeway (same as KFJZ AM/TV/later FM). TSN was sold to Metromedia and moved to 8585 Stemmons Freeway in Dallas. Later sites included periods where the network broadcast from facilities on John W. Carpenter Freeway in Dallas and at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas. In summer 2005, the station moved to a fifth floor office at the southwest corner of Fitzhugh and Central Expressway, in Dallas. Today Today, the focus of TSN is news, sports, business, weather, agriculture and talk programming to more than 100 affiliated radio stations in Texas, including the network’s flagship station KRLD which is located at the same facility north of downtown. Seven affiliates that carried TSN's premiere broadcast are still carrying the network’s programming. The tradition of sports broadcasts continues into the present as the network is also known as the Texas Rangers Radio Network, uplinking both home and road broadcasts for the Major League Baseball team to affiliates in Texas and in other states.

Biography  NakedBerlin-Tauentzien Photographer Henning von Berg (right) and his group of nude men on Berlin’s main shopping boulevard Tauentzien Henning von Berg was born in Northern Germany into a family with a nearly 550-year-old history. He worked as an engineer for thirteen years until the age of 35, when he discovered his calling was to be a photographer. In the summer of 1997, he organized his first group photo shoot. This featured 28 nude men in an abandoned factory in Cologne, on the river Rhine. Afterwards, the exhibition \\"Factory Boyz\\" quickly gained attention all around Germany for its bizarre combination of \\"body & building\\". Just one year later the image \\"Stairway\\" of this series with 13 nude male models was chosen by an American publisher to be included in an international anthology about photography: In Phil Braham's book \\"Naked Men Exposed - A Celebration of the Male Nude from 90 of the World's Greatest Photographers\\", the self-taught Berg was listed beside photographer icons like David Hockney, Horst P.

Thunder's Mouth: 2000. . Naked Sydney: Photographer Henning von Berg and his group of naked women in front of Sydney’s Opera House In 1999, von Berg claimed more recognition by organizing a whimsical social-political statement on public nudity. With his team he photographed six completely naked men in front of a dozen tourist highlights of Berlin, including the inside of the historical parliament Reichstag building. Thousands of fascinated passers- by applauded the fun happening throughout the city. This series \\"Naked Berlin\\" was supposed to be a political comment to show the liberal atmosphere and open-minded politics of the reunified republic. The politically active Berg wanted to document that his home country has learned from the terrible Nazi history and that Germany now is a modern democracy with a tolerant spirit and total freedom for the arts. The fun photographs of \\"Naked Berlin\\" were published by newspapers around the globe as \\"Reichstags Rascals\\". To date, the series \\"Naked Berlin\\" remains the world’s first and only-ever male nude photo shoot inside of a parliament building. In 2005, von Berg produced a suitable counterpart by photographing the other gender on the other side of the earth. The scandalous series \\"Naked Sydney\\" documented a group of happy naked women in downtown Sydney in front of some Australian national symbols, including the famous Sydney Opera House. Later both provocative series were presented in exhibitions worldwide. The Goethe-Institut, a German non-profit organization whose mission is to promote German language and culture outside of the German- speaking countries, promoted the exhibit \\"Naked Berlin - Naked Sydney\\" internationally and thus far more than 200,000 people have enjoyed the unique exhibitions.Canadian newspaper about HvB's \\"Nudes in Public\\"  Recent work  Henning von Berg is specialized in character portraits of seniors (his oldest model so far is a 108-year-old woman) and fine art nudes of mostly amateurs models. Von Berg prefers shooting in natural light conditions and likes to integrate panoramic landscapes and monumental buildings into his art. For his various art projects, he likes to break traditional rules. He works with young and old people, men and women, aristocrats and prostitutes, athletes and disabled people, common folks and celebrities (e.g., Julius Shulman, Tim Curry, Kurt Kreuger, Derrick Davenport and Don Bachardy).Portraits of Don Bachardy and Michael York in private sittings and public events. In autumn of 2006, the international non-profit art organization Tom of Finland Foundation in Los Angeles asked von Berg to become a \\"Foundation Liaison\\" to Germany/Europe.[Tom of Finland's art work is featured in several museums, i.e., the L.A.

Leader (AM-490) was laid down by J. M. Martinac Shipbuilding Corp., Tacoma, Washington, 22 September 1953; launched 15 September 1954; sponsored by Mrs. Norman Wordlund; reclassified MSO-490 7 February 1955, and commissioned 16 November 1955, Lt. Comdr. Harvey E. Toponce in command. This MSO class of minesweeper was constructed of non-magnetic materials, including a wooden hull and aluminum engines, and had a degaussing system to reduce the magnetic field of the vessel, so that it could move over magnetic mines without detonating them. It was equipped with a \\"magnetic tail\\", two thick cables spooled on a large reel aft of the superstructure. The power-generation system could send current through this split tail after it was streamed behind the ship, creating a magnetic field designed to set off magnetic mines after the ship passed over them. It carried conventional mine-sweeping gear as well.  Pacific Ocean operations  After shakedown, Leader joined Mine Squadron 9 at Long Beach, California, 21 December. During 1956, she performed mine evaluation exercises and tactical training until 1 October when she departed on her first WestPac cruise. Arriving Yokosuka 30 October, she operated with the U.S. 7th Fleet for the next 5 months performing mine warfare exercises in the Far East. Returning home 12 April 1957, the minesweeper resumed mine evaluation tests along the U.S. West Coast; and she continued these operations for the next 2 years.  Cambodia and Vietnam operations  Leader off Vietnam in 1965. From 1959 through 1968 Leader alternated six WestPac cruises with U.S. West Coast mine warfare and mine countermeasure exercises. During her 1961 cruise. Leader became the first warship ever to visit the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh when she completed the 180-mile transit up the Mekong River on 27 August, under the command of Lt. Commander Frank Kauzlarich. On this same cruise she directed South Vietnamese units in minesweep training operations. During her tour with the U.S. 7th Fleet in 1965, Leader again operated off South Vietnam, this time under more serious circumstances. From June to August she performed special minesweeping operations and played a major role in the expanded American effort to assist the courageous people of Vietnam in their fight against Communist aggressors. Her tour completed, Leader returned to Long Beach 14 December to resume training operations.  Market Time operations  1966 saw an extensive overhaul for the minesweeper, from 9 May to 30 September. After further training and readying for deployment, Leader once again sailed for WestPac 6 January 1967. She participated in Market Time operations for the better part of her tour, returning to Long Beach 18 November. She operated locally through the first half of 1968. Then, on 12 August, Leader departed Long Beach for another extensive deployment, and continued operating off Vietnam into 1969. Persian Gulf War service USS Leader (MSO-490) aboard Super Servant 3. Leader was lifted to the Persian gulf following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. She was loaded aboard the Dutch heavy lift ship Super Servant 3 on 19 August 1990 at Norfolk along with USS Impervious (MSO-449), USS Adroit (MSO-509) and USS Avenger (MCM-1). She was offloaded 5 October 1990 in the middle east. Impervious returned to Norfolk on 14 November 1991 with USS Impervious (MSO-449) and USS Adroit (MSO-509) aboard Super Servant 4. She participated in minesweeping operations to clear mines for anticipated d-day style landing by US Marines as part of the diversionary force which allowed land forces to take Iraqi Artillery positions from behind. On 28 February 1991 at 0500 they were ordered to storm the beaches at 0300 they were ordered to stand down as Iraq had surrendered and the war was over. She also did escort duty for the battleships USS Missouri and USS Wisconsin. as part of two naval battle groups built around the aircraft carriers USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and USS Independence to the Gulf, where they were ready by 8 August. She did riggings for HM-14 Airborne Mine Countermeasures minesweeping helicopters stationed aboard the USS Tripoli. This was the minesweeping gear use to clear anchored mines such as the one that hit Tripoli. Tripoli proceeded into the northern Persian Gulf and assumed duties as flagship for Airborne Mine Countermeasures operations there with HM-14 deployed aboard. On the morning of 18 February 1991,at 0436 ( 4:37 a.m.) Tripoli was rocked by a mine explosion on her starboard bow. The explosion ripped a 16 by 20 ft hole in the ship's hull and injured four sailors. The Tripoli was towed off of three other unexploded mines by two MCM ships. After 20 hours of damage control, the ship was stabilized and was actually ready to resume operations. However her HM-14 fuel tanks were damaged by the mine hit and she was unable to deploy her HM-14's due to a lack of fuel. The Impervious and sister MSO's were her escorts. USS Impervious was responsible for removing these mines that threatened the Tripoli. Soon after the Iraqi invasion, it became clear that Iraq was laying mines in international waters. U.S. ships discovered and destroyed six mines during December. The U.S. Mine Countermeasures Group (USMCMG) was established with the objective of clearing a path to the beach for a possible amphibious landing and battleship gunfire support. The minesweepers USS Adroit (MSO 509), USS Impervious (MSO 449), and USS Leader (MSO 490) along with the newly commissioned mine countermeasures ship USS Avenger (MCM 1 ) arrived in the Gulf aboard the heavy-lift ship Super Servant III. More than 20 Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams were also deployed to support the mine countermeasures force. Allied minesweepers from Saudi Arabia, Great Britain and Kuwait, and the MH-53 Super Stallions of Mine Countermeasures Helicopter Squadron 14 joined the MCM effort. After months of training off Dubai, United Arab Emirates, USMCMG staff embarked in USS Tripoli (LPH 10) on 20 January, and proceeded to the northern Gulf waters to perform their mission. As flagship for the combined operation, Tripoli's flight deck was the base for the mine-sweeping helicopters. Six British minesweepers joined their U.S. counterparts, with British and U.S. warships providing air defense. USMCMG began its work 60 miles east of the Kuwaiti coastline, working initially to clear a 15-mile long, 1,000-yard wide path. The mine-clearing task force spent the first few weeks of DESERT STORM pushing 24 miles to \\"Point FOXTROT,\\" a 10-mile by 3.5-mile box which became the battleship gunfire support area south of Faylaka Island. While sweeping further toward shore, the task group was targeted by Iraqi fire control radars associated with Silkworm missile sites inside Kuwait. Task force ships moved out of Silkworm range and worked to locate the radar site. During those maneuvers on 18 February, Iraqi mines found their mark. Within three hours of each other, Tripoli and USS Princeton (CG 59) were rocked by exploding mines. As damage control teams successfully overcame fires and flooding aboard Tripoli and Princeton, Impervious, Leader and Avenger searched for additional mines in the area. Adroit led the salvage tug USS Beaufort (ATS 2) toward Princeton to tow her to safety. Tripoli was able to continue her mission for several days before she was relieved by USS La Salle (AGF 3) and USS New Orleans (LPH 11) and proceeded to Bahrain for repairs. New Orleans provided the helicopter deck while the mine group staff moved aboard La Salle to coordinate the operation. Princeton restored her TLAM strike and AEGIS anti-air warfare defense capabilities within fifteen minutes of the mine strike, whereupon she reassumed duties as local anti-air warfare coordinator and remained on station, providing defense for the mine countermeasures group for an additional 30 hours, until relieved. Charts and intelligence captured from Iraq showed the mine field where Tripoli and Princeton were hit was one of six laid in a 150-mile arc from Faylaka Island to the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. Within that arc, there were four additional mine- lines—a total of more than 1,000 mines—laid over a five-month period. Three days later, the massive 31-ship amphibious task force moved north to assist in battlefield preparation as the deadline for the ground offensive neared. As Wisconsin and Missouri steamed in the vicinity of recently cleared \\"Point FOXTROT,\\" their gun crews continued to pound Iraqi targets. Marine AV-8B Harriers launched from the flight deck of Nassau conducted strikes ashore. Leader was decommissioned on 12 December 1991 and was struck from the Navy list on 18 March 1992. She was sold for scrapping in 1994.

He was a member of the syndicate that published the Second Folio collection of Shakespeare's plays in 1632.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 211. His bookshop was in Chancery Lane, near Sergeant's Inn. Beginnings Hawkins served his apprenticeship under the stationer Edmond Matts in 1604-11; in turn he acquired Matts's business in 1613 and established himself as an independent publisher. In his first year, Hawkins reprinted John Marston's The Metamorphosis of Pigmalion's Image, a work originally issued by Matts in 1598. Hawkins's initial entry into the Stationers' Register was Elizabeth Tanfield Cary's The Tragedy of Mariam, which he also printed in 1613 -- a work now recognized as the first tragedy by a woman to be published in English. Shakespeare Hawkins's connection with the Shakespeare canon started in 1628; an entry in the Stationers' Register, dated 1 March that year, records the transfer of the rights to Othello from Thomas Walkley, the publisher of the play's first quarto (1622), to Hawkins. (The same transfer included the rights to the Beaumont and Fletcher plays Philaster and A King and No King.) Hawkins then published the second quarto of Othello (printed by Augustine Matthews) in 1630. Hawkins's text combined elements from the two previous texts, the 1622 first quarto and the First Folio of 1623, which showed significant differences.Andrew Murphy, ed., A Concise Companion to Shakespeare and the Text, London, Blackwell, 2007; p. 69. Hawkins's possession of the copyright to one Shakespearean play enabled him to become one of the subsidiary members of Robert Allot's syndicate (the others were William Aspley, Richard Meighen, and John Smethwick) when Allot published the Second Folio. Others Beyond the confines of the Shakespeare canon, Hawkins a published number of other play texts. They included: * the first quarto of Cary's The Tragedy of Mariam (1613), printed by Thomas Creede; * the third quarto of Philaster (1628); * the third quarto of Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy (1630); * the third quarto of A King and No King (1631).E. K.Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 222-5. A fourth quarto of Philaster was published, under Hawkins's imprint, posthumously in 1634. Like some other publishers of his time, Hawkins sometimes wrote prefaces for the playbooks he issued. In his preface to Philaster, Hawkins compares the plays of English Renaissance drama to gold, and publishers to \\"merchant adventurers.\\" Hawkins was one of the small minority who wrote prefatory material in verse, as in his editions of A King and No King and The Maid's Tragedy.David Moore Bergeron, Textual Patronage in English Drama, 1570-1640, London, Ashgate, 2006; pp. 38-9 n. 39. Hawkins published a range of contemporary literature in his generation, including a 1629 edition of Hero and Leander (Marlowe's poem with Chapman's continuation), and the 1619 and 1622 editions of the Nosce Teipsum of the poet John Davies of Hereford. He ventured into music publishing, with a 1631 edition of the canzonets of Thomas Morley. One of Hawkins's final projects was the first English edition of Mathematical Recreations (1633), by Jean Leurechon (alias \\"Hendrik van Etten\\")Trevor Henry Hall, Mathematical Recreations: An Exercise in Seventeenth-Century Bibliography, Leeds, University of Leeds Press, 1969. -- translated by Francis Malthus, and printed by Thomas Cotes, the same man who printed the Second Folio.

Its main avenue is 18 de Julio Avenue. It is delimited by La Paz Str. to the North, Florida Str. (North of 18 de julio Av.) and Andes Str. (South of 18 de Julio Av.) to the West, Canelones Str. to the South and Barrios Amorin Str. to the East. It used to be the main commercial venue of the city, but after the opening of the first malls, many small stores started closing down. Now, that process is being reverted and the area is coming back to life. History 1829 map of the proposed extension of the Ciudad Vieja Because of the military origins of Montevideo, it had been forbidden to build anything permanent in the area outside the walls of the city up to the time that Uruguay gained Independence. That area was called Campo de Marte or ejido (common). Around 1750, the colonial Gobernación Política y Militar de Montevideo traced the limits of the forbidden area at \\"a canonball's reach\\" from the city's fortifications by a line or \\"cordón\\". Eventually, Cordón became the name of the area outside the Campo de Marte. In 1829, four years after the declaration of Independence, the National Assembly decided to pull down the fortifications of the Ciudad Vieja and extend the city to form the \\"Ciudad Nueva\\". At the time, the population of Montevideo was around 14,000. The plans for some additional 160 city blocks were drawn by military engineer Don José María Reyes. That extension is the actual barrio of Centro. The plans included a new square, which in 1840 took on the name Plaza Cagancha, while the names of the streets were given by Andrés Lamas from 1843 on. The development of this area was very slow due to the \\"Guerra Grande\\" of 1839-1852. In 1867 a pillar with the statue of Peace (La Paz) was erected in the centre of Plaza Cagancha. Squares and buildings Along 18 de Julio Avenue there are two central and frequented squares: Plaza Fabini, commonly called Plaza del Entrevero because of the sculpture of its main fountain, called \\"The Entrevero\\", by José Belloni, and Plaza Cagancha, commonly called Plaza Libertad. The former is mostly used as a relaxation area and the latter is mostly a place where craftsmen and other small vendors exhibit their work and products for sale. One of the most architecturally notable buildings of the Centro, is the Palacio Lapido, designed by Juan Aubriot and built in 1933, a National Heritage Site since 1989. Other National Heritage Sites of the Centro are the Jockey Club, the Sala Zitarrosa on Plaza Fabini, the Ateneo de Montevideo and the Palacio Piria (seat of the Supreme Court) on Plaza Cagancha, the Palacio Santos (seat of the Uruguayan Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and the Mercado de la Ambundancia. The Centro is also home to the Palacio Municipal, the building of the City Hall, with a wide public area in front of it featuring an impressive copy of Michaelangelo's David.

After repairs at Philadelphia from August–October 1862, Wissahickon joined the blockade of the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia and eastern Florida. She took part in bombardments of Fort McAllister, Georgia, in late 1862-early 1863 and in the destruction of the privateer Rattlesnake (ex-CSS Nashville) on 28 February 1863. One of her sailors, Captain of the Forecastle Henry Shutes, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his part in the action at Fort McAllister and the earlier Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip.

The goal is to allow developers to create applications that take advantage of running on a local client, while having the same ease of maintenance as web-based applications. Description There are several parts to Expeditor: * Lotus Expeditor Client for Desktop is used for the running client applications on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. These applications can be written using a combination of OSGi, Java EE, and Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) technologies, running on a Java virtual machine. * Lotus Expeditor Client for Devices is a configuration of platform for Microsoft Windows Mobile devices and the Nokia E90 Communicator. This configuration of the platform includes the Eclipse embedded Rich Client Platform (eRCP) running on a Java ME virtual machine. * Lotus Expeditor Server is used to deploy, configure and maintain applications running on Lotus Expeditor Clients. It runs on top of the IBM DB2 database management system and the Java EE-based IBM WebSphere Application Server. Expeditor Server is not necessary for Expeditor Client applications to run. Client applications can run standalone, and optionally exploit the services of the Lotus Expeditor Server for data synchronization, transactional messaging and automated, remote, application management. In addition, Lotus Expeditor Toolkit is for developers to create Expeditor applications and create customized Expeditor runtimes. It runs on top of the Eclipse integrated development environment. Lotus Software uses Expeditor in many of its own products, including Notes (from version 8), Sametime (from version 7.5), and Symphony. History Lotus Expeditor has its roots in IBM's Pervasive Computing (PvC) initiatives. which were associated with the pursuit of ubiquitous computing. Early forms of Lotus Expeditor were first outlined publicly in 2001 in an article on IBM's Pervasive Computing Device Architecture.Jim Colson, The Pervasive Computing Device Architecture , MicroDevNet, April 3, 2001. Accessed 2007-11-06 This architecture served as the basis for IBM PvC embedded software deliveries in many areas, including automotive telematics, industrial control, residential gateways, desktop screenphones, and handheld mobile devices. In 2003, the core of the PvC Device Architecture, the OSGi Service Platform, was used in a refactoring of the Eclipse runtime to incubate what became Eclipse 3.0. This incubator project was referred to as Equinox. Eclipse 3.0 was released in 2004 as a refactored runtime (Rich Client Platform or RCP) and an integrated development environment (IDE) that exploited RCP. Later in 2004, IBM announced Workplace Client Technology (WCT) for creating managed client applications targeted at desktops. WCT was an application of the PvC Device Architecture to desktops, which then included the RCP technologies. WCT also came with document editors that could read word processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in OpenDocument format.Harish Grama, Keith Attenborough, John Banks-Binici, Jim Marsden, Carl Kraenzel, Jeff Calow, Shankar Ramaswamy, Yu Xin Kou, Mary Ellen Zurko, and Heidi Votaw, IBM Workplace Client Technology (Rich Client Edition) Technology Overview, IBM Redpaper, 2004.

Accessed 2007-09-26.David Reich, WCTME Technology Roadmap, IBM, 2004. Accessed 2007-09-26. IBM took the existing Workplace Client Technology and renamed it Workplace Client Technology, Rich Client Edition (later Rich Edition or WCTRE). IBM created a configuration of the WCTME platform, called Workplace Client Technology, Micro Edition--Enterprise Offering (WCTME-EO), as the first generally available product to support the construction and deployment of desktop applications for Workplace. WCT Micro Edition--Enterprise Offering had a smaller footprint than WCT Rich Edition by focusing only on the integration of line-of-business applications and, correspondingly, not including the document editors.Workplace Client Technology Micro Edition Enterprise Offering Application Developer's Guide, IBM, 2004.

It combines the 1990 Victoria Quarter (an upmarket district of interconnected contemporary and restored Victorian shopping arcades) west of Vicar Lane and the 2016 Victoria Gate shopping centre east of Vicar Lane. It includes a casino and major stores such as Harvey Nichols and John Lewis and Partners, and the largest stained glass work in Britain, by artist Brian Clarke. Victoria Quarter The Grade II* listed Victoria Quarter, known as 'the Knightsbridge of the North', is an upmarket network of interconnected shopping spaces covering three blocks between Briggate and Vicar Lane, comprising County Arcade, Cross Arcade, Queen Victoria Street (turned into an arcade in the 1989 redevelopment scheme through the pedestrianisation and glazing over of the street with what was at the time the largest secular stained glass work in the world) and King Edward Street. It opened as The Victoria Quarter in September 1990. County Arcade, Victoria Quarter History The County and Cross Arcades were built as part of the Leeds Estates Company's redevelopment of the east side of Briggate and west side of Vicar Lane between 1898 and 1904, and designed by the theatre architect Frank Matcham. They were notable for glazed barrel roofing decorated with copious amounts of faience from the Burmantofts Pottery, a number of mosaics and plentiful use of marble. Matcham's development included the Empire Theatre and all three constructions were in the same style: three storeys decorated in a free baroque style with pink and buff terracotta. Detail of the stained glass canopy by Brian Clarke which spans the length of the Victoria Quarter's Queen Victoria Street arcade In 1961, the Empire Theatre was demolished to make way for another arcade in contemporary style. Having become dilapidated, the arcades were restored by Derek Latham & Co in phases between 1989 and 1996, and in 1989 Queen Victoria Street was glazed over in its entirety with a stained glass canopy by British artist Brian Clarke. The artwork, which in its design references Leeds' heritage as a centre of the textile industry, remains the largest stained glass window in Britain and Europe. The arcade that replaced the theatre was demolished and replaced by a branch of Harvey Nichols which opened in 1996, the first branch outside London. Victoria Gate Victoria Gate was built on an undeveloped site adjacent to Leeds Market. The £165 million covered shopping centre opened on 20 October 2016. The centre, fronting onto Eastgate, George Street and Harewood Street, comprises a large multi-storey car park, a John Lewis & Partners store, and a U-shaped covered pedestrian area of shops, restaurants, and cafes. The development incorporates Templar Square, a public space incorporating the listed Templar House. History A development known as Eastgate Quarters was announced in 2004, following several cancelled schemes for a site that had been derelict from the 1970s, located to the east of Leeds city centre. The 2004 Eastgate masterplan was developed by Terry Farrell and outline planning permission was obtained in 2007. A number of architects were appointed that year to design buildings in the masterplan, including the Jerde Partnership and Benoy for the Templar Arcade, Thomas Heatherwick for Harewood Quarter, ACME for the John Lewis Store and McAslan for buildings along Eastgate. The scheme was put on hold in late 2008. In 2010 Hammerson announced that work had commenced on a revised masterplan and in March 2011, an outline planning application for Eastgate Quarters developed by ACME was submitted to Leeds City Council. On 13 July 2011, planning permission was granted for the Hammerson scheme to proceed.

The Paramount had seating for 2,556 in stalls and circle levels, and featured the fourth largest Wurlitzer organ in Europe. The Wurlitzer was removed from the Odeon during the mid 1960s as is now happily playing at Thursford Collection in Thursford, Norfolk. The resident organist at Thursford is Robert Wolfe. The Cinema was very popular and had 1.2 million patrons during its first year. In 1940 the name was changed to the Odeon following the purchase of the Paramount cinemas in the United Kingdom by the owner of Odeon, the Rank Organisation and became a concert venue, while still being a cinema. In 1963 and 1964 it staged two concerts by The Beatles. In 1969 it was converted to a twin cinema, and in 1978 a third screen was built in the former Paramount Restaurant. In 1988 the Odeon was refurbished and made into a 5-screen cinema with a reduced seating capacity of 1,923. The Odeon, which was the last picture palace in the city centre, closed due to competition with local multiplexes and the impending opening of a thirteen screen multiplex at The Light retail and leisure complex originally operated by Ster Century and now Vue, it closed in 2001. The building which was originally to be converted to an apartment & leisure complex but was almost immediately bought by Primark who converted it into a large three storey clothes store that opened in August 2005. The building is now a Sports Direct store. The Paramount Cinema's architects were designed by Frank Verity and Samuel Beverley. Merrion Centre The former first floor entrance to the Merrion Odeon The former Odeon cinema in the Merrion Centre is now largely forgotten but the site remains behind locked doors as it did in the 1970s. The site only operated as a cinema for 13 years between 1964 and 1977 before it was closed. Where some Yorkshire Bank cash machines are within the centre was the main entry into a cinema that could accommodate nearly 1,000 film fans, The doors have now been boarded up but remain padlocked behind the wall holding the cash machines. The cinema occupies a space above the current Home Bargains (formerly Woolworths) and if you take the stairs in the Merrion Centre to the upper level you can still see a second set of doors into the former cinema near an entrance into the Merrion Centre car park. The projection equipment has been removed, as have the seats but much of the building remains untouched. The cinema is now inaccessible but in 2002 Greg Taylor, who works for a TV company was inside the redundant building scouting for possible TV locations and took a series of photographs. In a similar location to where the Merrion Centre is now, an Odeon \\"Super Cinema\\" was planned on Merrion Street and was possibly of the typical Odeon art deco style but was cancelled presumably due to the purchase of the former Paramount cinema and the start of the Second World War.

He studied medicine under Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol (1772–1840), and was later chief physician at the Bicêtre in Paris. Two of his better known students were Paul Broca (1824–1880) and Louis Pierre Gratiolet (1815–1865). Leuret was also chief-editor of Annales d’hygiène publique et de médecine légale, an influential journal of hygiene and forensic medicine. Leuret is remembered for his work in comparative anatomy of the brain with Louis Gratiolet. The two men did extensive topographic mapping of the folds and fissures of the cerebral cortex. Leuret coined the name \\"fissure of Rolando\\" after Italian anatomist Luigi Rolando (1773–1831) for what is now known as the central sulcus of the brain. Leuret was an important figure in the early days of French psychiatry. He stressed the importance of using a rational and humane approach in treatment of the mentally ill, and also believed that the criminally insane were sick individuals who were incapable of controlling their behavior. He felt that the origins of mental illness were unknown, and that it was wrong to define madness from only a somatic standpoint. Leuret's psychiatric theories put him at odds with other French physicians, particularly those who thought that the source of mental illness could be localized to a specific part of the brain's anatomy. He was also scornful of the speculative theory of phrenology.

A tornado was reported within the Toronto city limits, although this was never officially confirmed by the Meteorological Service of Canada. The storms morphed into heavy rain cells when reaching Toronto. The Insurance Bureau of Canada has estimated that insured losses were the highest in the province's history, exceeding 500 million Canadian dollars, two and a half times that of Ontario's losses during the 1998 ice storm and the second largest loss event in Canadian history until another event of torrential rain of July 8, 2013 (1 billion CAD).  Meteorological events  Composite weather map on the morning of August 19, 2005 Tornadoes and downpour cells tracks with time shown in local time and their motion speed in yellow On the early morning of August 19, a low-pressure area was sitting over Northern Michigan with a cold front southwestward. This same system had been causing an outbreak of tornadoes over Wisconsin the day before. As shown in the map to the left, there was up to of precipitable water in the warm air mass invading Southern Ontario with a strong southwesterly low level jet parallel to the cold front and the presence of an upper jet-stream. All of these were very favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms. Furthermore, the wind shear in the lower troposphere was creating a large helicity value conducive to a tornado potential. With the advancing cold front, two lines of thunderstorms developed. The first one was near Stratford, Ontario ( west of Kitchener), and spread as far north as Georgian Bay near Collingwood, Ontario while the second one was following behind near the shores of Lake Huron. They tracked eastward and reached as far as Oshawa during the afternoon. Dozens of storm cells populated the line, two of them developing into tornadic supercells. At their worst, the tornadoes reached the F2 level, with gusts between . Severe thunderstorm warnings were sent, mentioning the possibility of tornadoes in view of the radar output and the potential analysis. The main storm, later dubbed the Toronto Supercell, spawned a first tornado tracking through Milverton () to Conestogo Lake () (west of Elmira) from 12:40 to 1:20 pm local time. A second twister moved from Salem () to Lake Belwood () (north of Guelph), passing just to the north of Fergus 10 minutes later. When the storm came close to the Greater Toronto Area, a tornado warning was issued, but the storm changed its characteristics. It produced winds of well over , golf ball sized hail, but mostly heavy rain flooding many parts of the city between 2 and 4 pm. Finally, another severe storm passing Southeast of Stratford, in the Tavistock area (), gave an F1 tornado with winds between by 3:20 pm.  Storm's characteristics  The Toronto Supercell maintained all the characteristics of a tornado producer as it approached the city. Convective storm detection showed on weather radars a hook echo, a BWER and a strong mesocyclone but the vortex left the ground after the second tornado. Studies were made to try to explain the change in behavior to an extremely high producer of rain. One area of Thornhill, just north of the Toronto City limits recorded of rain in less than 1 hour. Toronto is situated by Lake Ontario and a lake breeze often develops during the day. This wind brings cooler air at the surface and causes a marine temperature inversion which could have been enough to keep the rotation aloft. To the west of the city, there is the Niagara Escarpment, reaching above sea level (ASL), while the shores of Lake Ontario are just ASL. This drop could equally have cut off the rotation from the surface. The lightning shows that there was a strong peak during the F2 tornadoes, dominated by the positive cloud-to-ground strikes. Studies have shown that this is often the case in tornadic storms. It was followed by a sharp drop and then another peak, but this one dominated by negative lightning during the flooding phase of the storm.  Impacts  Flood waters washed away a portion of a parking lot near Keele St. and Highway 7 in Vaughan. The twisters uprooted hundreds of trees, chewed the limbs off of countless others, downed power lines, tossed cars and trucks aside, and ripped into several homes, cottages and barns. In Guelph and Orangeville, 10,000 residents were left without power. No deaths or injuries were reported. In Toronto, of rain fell in one hour in North York and surrounding area, double the amount left by Hurricane Hazel in 1954 (the heaviest rain from Hazel fell over Etobicoke and the Airport area). At the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) Downsview headquarters, of rain fell, of which occurred in less than an hour, a record for any storm in Toronto. A block or two to the north in Thornhill, a weather watcher emptied her rain gauge at . Rainfall totals from the storm exceeded in parts in Vaughan. A volunteer storm spotter reported a tornado in the north part of the city but it was not confirmed by Environment Canada. The rain washed out a portion of Finch Avenue near Sentinel Ave in North York. It overflowed storm drains which caused severe basement flooding to many thousands of homes and two floors of the MSC building. Around Toronto, torrential rains snarled traffic and stranded drivers. Fire services responded to more than 1,000 calls. Marine services personnel rescued four people who fell into the fast-moving currents of the Don River.

Originally applied to nuclear power, the phrase is also used for services that can be provided at such low cost that the additional cost of itemized billing would outweigh the benefits. Origins The phrase was coined by Lewis Strauss, then chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, who, in a 1954 speech to the National Association of Science Writers, said: > It is not too much to expect that our children will enjoy in their homes > electrical energy too cheap to meter, will know of great periodic regional > famines in the world only as matters of history, will travel effortlessly > over the seas and under them and through the air with a minimum of danger > and at great speeds, and will experience a lifespan far longer than ours, as > disease yields and man comes to understand what causes him to age. It was this statement that caught the eye of most reviewers and was the headline in a New York Times article covering the speech, subtitled \\"It will be too cheap for our children to meter, Strauss tells science writers.\\" Only a few days later, Strauss was a guest on Meet the Press. When the reporters asked him about the quotation and the viability of \\"commercial power from atomic piles,\\" Strauss replied that he expected his children and grandchildren would have power \\"too cheap to be metered, just as we have water today that's too cheap to be metered.\\" The statement was contentious from the start. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission itself, in testimony to the U.S. Congress only months before, lowered the expectations for fission power, projecting only that the costs of reactors could be brought down to about the same as those for conventional sources. A later survey found dozens of statements from the period that suggested it was widely believed that nuclear energy would be more expensive than coal, at least in the foreseeable future. James Ramey, who would later become the AEC Commissioner, noted: \\"Nobody took Strauss' statement very seriously.\\" The phrase has also been attributed to Walter Marshall, a pioneer of nuclear power in the United Kingdom. There is no documentary evidence that he invented or used the term. Fusion or fission? Strauss's prediction did not come true, and over time it became a target of those pointing to the industry's record of overpromising and underdelivering. In 1980, the Atomic Industrial Forum wrote an article quoting his son, Lewis H. Strauss, claiming that he was talking about not nuclear fission but nuclear fusion. As the AEC's Project Sherwood was still classified at the time he gave the speech, he was not allowed to refer to this work directly. Since that time, this claim has been widely repeated, including in 2003 comments by Donald Hintz, chairman of the Nuclear Energy Institute. To support that argument, Strauss and biographer Pfau point to this statement: \\"industry would have electrical power from atomic furnaces in five to fifteen years.\\" It was claimed that the timeline implies that Strauss was referring to fusion, not fission. Although it is not a direct quote, this version of the statement appeared in the New York Times overview of the speech the next day. The statement in question is originally: > Dr. Lawrence Hafstad, whom all of you surely know, happens to be speaking, > today, in Brussels before the Congress of Industrial Chemistry. He heads the > Reactor Development Division of the Atomic Energy Commission. Therefore, he > expects to be asked, \\"How soon will you have industrial atomic electric > power in the United States?\\" His answer is \\"from 5 to 15 years depending on > the vigor of the development effort.\\" This statement is referring directly to fission reactors and immediately precedes the \\"too cheap to meter\\" statement. The same is true of his statements on Meet the Press, which are a direct reply to a question about fission. The speech as a whole contains large sections about the development of fission power and the difficulties that the Commission was having communicating this fact. He wryly notes receiving letters addressed to the \\"Atomic Bomb Commission\\" and then quotes a study that demonstrates the public is largely ignorant of the development of atomic power. He goes on to briefly recount the development of fission, noting a letter from Leo Szilard of sixteen years earlier where he speaks of the possibility of a chain reaction. A later examination of the topic concluded: \\"there is no evidence in Strauss's papers at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library to indicate fusion was the hidden subject of his speech.\\" Strauss viewed hydrogen fusion as the ultimate power source and was eager to develop the technology as quickly as possible and urged the Project Sherwood researchers to make rapid progress, even suggesting a million-dollar prize to the individual or team that succeeded first.Bromberg, Joan Lisa (1982) Fusion: Science, Politics, and the Invention of a New Energy Source MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, p. 44, However Strauss was not optimistic about the rapid commercialization of fusion power. In August 1955 after fusion research was made public, he cautioned that \\"there has been nothing in the nature of breakthroughs that would warrant anyone assuming that this [fusion power] was anything except a very long range—and I would accent the word 'very'—prospect.\\" Other uses The phrase became famous enough that it has been used in other contexts, especially in post- scarcity discussions. For instance, landline (and cable) internet bandwidth is now often billed on a flat monthly fee with no usage limits, and it is predicted that the introduction of 5G will do the same for mobile data, making it \\"too cheap to meter.\\" The same has been said for technology as a whole.

The Maverick was also manufactured in Venezuela, Canada, Mexico, and, from 1970 to 1979, in Brazil. The name \\"maverick\\" was derived from the word for unbranded range animals, and the car's nameplate was stylized to resemble the head of a longhorn cattle. History The Maverick was introduced on April 17, 1969, as a 1970 model. The Maverick was originally conceived and marketed as a subcompact \\"import fighter\\", intended to compete against the newer Japanese rivals for North America from Honda, Datsun, and Toyota. The Falcon, Ford's compact offering since 1960 and main rival to the Chevrolet Nova and Dodge Dart, had seen its sales decimated by the introduction of the Mustang in 1964, and despite a redesign in 1966, was unable to meet the then forthcoming U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration motor vehicle standards that would come into effect on January 1, 1970. Consequently, the Falcon was discontinued midway through the 1970 model year, and the Maverick repositioned as Ford's compact entry, giving the Nova and Dart a new rival. A bigger Falcon was a rebranded low-trim version of the Fairlane for the second half of the model year, then went away. The Maverick's styling featured the long hood, fastback roof, and short deck popularized by the Mustang, on a wheelbase — and featured pop-out rear side windows. Nearly 579,000 Mavericks were produced in its first year, approaching the record-setting first year of Mustang sales (nearly 619,000), and easily outpaced the Mustang's sales of fewer than 200,000 in 1970. Total North American Maverick production (1969-1977) reached 2.1 million units.http://mmb.maverick.to/threads/hemings-article-maverick- turns-50.118077/#post-1134488 Trim packages and variants Initially available only as a two-door sedan, early models lacked a glove compartment, which was added during the model year 1973 (early 1973 models still lacked a glove compartment). A four-door sedan on a wheelbase was introduced for 1971. At introduction, exterior paint colors were named with puns, including \\"Anti- Establish Mint\\", \\"Hulla Blue\\", \\"Original Cinnamon\\", \\"Freudian Gilt\\", and \\"Thanks Vermillion\\" — along with more typical names including black jade, champagne gold, gulfstream aqua, meadowlark yellow, Brittany blue, lime gold, Dresden blue, raven black, Wimbledon white, and candyapple red. In the first half of production for the 1970 model, two engine options were available, a straight-six and a straight-six. A straight-six was added mid-year. Commercials and advertising compared the Maverick, at $1,995, to the smaller Volkswagen Beetle, which was about $500 less in price. The Pinto was later Ford's primary competitor to the Beetle in the subcompact class, while also competing in that segment with the Chevrolet Vega and AMC Gremlin subcompacts new to the market at that time. The earliest Mavericks featured two-spoke steering wheels with partial horn rings, also found on other 1969 Fords, while late 1969 production was changed to revised steering wheels with no horn rings. Also, the early models located the ignition switch in the instrument panel while the cars built after September 1, 1969, had the ignition switches mounted on locking steering columns, as did all other 1970 Fords in compliance with a new federal safety mandate that took effect with the 1970 model year. A four-door model was introduced for 1971, available with a vinyl roof. Mercury also revived the Comet as a rebadged variant of the Maverick. Also for 1971, an optional 302 CID V8 was introduced for both the Comet and the Maverick. The Comet was distinguished from the Maverick by using a different grille, taillights, trim, and hood. The Maverick Grabber trim package was introduced in mid-1970. In addition to larger tire fitment, the package included graphics and trim, including a spoiler. It was offered from 1970 to 1975. In 1971 and 1972, the Grabber came with a special \\"dual dome\\" hood. A \\"sprint\\" package offered for 1972 featured white and blue two-toned paint with red pinstripes and a special color-coordinated interior. The rear quarter panels included a stylized U.S.A. flag shield. This trim package acknowledged the 1972 Olympics and was available for only one year. A \\"luxury decor option\\" (LDO) trim level introduced late in the 1972 model year included reclining bucket seats in a soft vinyl material, plush carpeting, woodgrained instrument panel trim, radial tires with body-color deluxe wheel covers, and a vinyl roof. The Maverick LDO option was one of the first American compacts to be marketed as a lower-priced (and domestic) alternative to the more expensive European luxury and touring sedans from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, and others. Minor changes were made from 1973 to 1975. For 1973, the 170 CID engine was dropped, making the 200 CID I6 the standard engine. Additionally, improved brakes and a previously optional chrome grille became standard. An AM/FM stereo, aluminum wheels, and a slightly larger front bumper to comply with federal 5 MPH regulations were also standard. In 1974, the Maverick was unchanged except for new larger federally-required 5 MPH bumpers for both front and rear which required new rear quarter panel end caps. Jumping gas prices and increasing demand for smaller cars resulting from the Arab oil embargo did cause the Maverick to grow in popularity, selling 10,000 more units than the year before. Production of the Maverick dropped in 1975 with the release of the Granada as a more European-style luxury compact (the Granada and Maverick shared the same basic chassis). The Maverick received minor trim changes for 1975 that included new grilles and the replacement of nameplates on the hood and trunklid with Ford nameplates, in block letters. In 1976, the Grabber was dropped, and a \\"Stallion\\" package was introduced. The Stallion option came with special paint and trim. Standard Mavericks received new grilles and gained front disc brakes as standard equipment along with new foot-operated parking brakes that replaced the old under-dash T-handle units. Sales continued to drop. In its final year, the Maverick remained unchanged for 1977 except for a police package which was not sufficiently upgraded for police work and sold less than 400 units. The Maverick was produced in Brazil until 1979. In 2018 Rogério Ferraresi, in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, created a Ford Maverick pedal car. It was the first time that this type of toy based on a Maverick was produced ( http://www.classicshow.com.br/site/pedal-car-brasil/ ). The Maverick's place in the North American Ford lineup was essentially taken by the 1978 Fairmont. The Maverick had no significant changes towards the end of its lifespan, since it was originally meant to be replaced in 1975 by the Granada. However, Ford decided to keep selling both lines until the 1978 model year introduction of the Fairmont. Revival On April 30, 2020 a 3-D model of a Ford tailgate stamped with the Maverick name was leaked. This started speculation that a new compact pickup truck would bear the Maverick nameplate. On July 20, 2020 a photo of what appears to be a sheet metal tailgate matching the model rendering was leaked. A later report included more details, alleging it would be based on the Ford Transit Connect and smaller in size than the fourth generation Ford Ranger that was introduced in 2019.

It was published in 1999. Plot One evening, at the home of the cobbler old Bob and his washerwoman wife Joan, there is a knock at the door. Bob opens the door and sees a little boy in a torn and stained page's uniform. When asked \\"who are you?\\", the boy replies \\"I was a rat\\". Bob and Joan have no children and they take care of the boy by providing food and a bed. The boy was unable to eat with a spoon, and during his first evening he tore his sheets and blankets into strips. However, Bob and Joan were patient and the boy was a quick learner who, wanting to please them, carefully followed their instructions. When he spots a photograph of Princess Aurelia, the prince's fiancée, in the newspaper, he appears to recognise her as 'Mary Jane'. Joan calls the boy \\"Roger\\", the name Bob and Joan would have used for their son. Bob and Joan take Roger to the City Hall to find how to return Roger to his proper home. An official declares that there are no lost children in the city, then notices that Roger has eaten a pencil belonging to the City Council. Bob and Joan take Roger to the orphanage, the police station, and the hospital, but no one can help locate Roger's home. The Philosopher Royal learns about Roger and his belief that he was a rat, and takes Roger to the palace for tests. Roger announces that he has \\"been here before\\", and states that the Prince will marry Mary Jane, only to be told that the Prince will marry Aurelia. When confronted by a cat, Roger runs away from the palace and undergoes adventures as people exploit his ability to eat almost anything, and to wriggle through small openings. Roger escapes and lives in the sewers, but is discovered by the local paper, The Daily Scourge, who exploit Roger again by writing about \\"the monster of the sewers\\". After a publicity campaign, Roger is captured and declared a menace whose fate is to be determined by a tribunal. Bob and Joan learn that the tribunal may declare Roger to be a non- human monster that must be exterminated. Joan notices a picture of Princess Aurelia who by now has married the Prince. Joan remembers that Roger had mentioned Mary Jane, so in desperation Bob and Joan contact the Princess. When hearing about Roger and the name \\"Mary Jane\\" she announces that she will help. Due to her intervention, Roger is saved and is adopted by Bob and Joan. The Princess had been a girl who worked in the kitchen and kept a pet rat. Her wish to attend a ball at the palace was granted, and her rat was turned into a page boy as her attendant – a \\"Cinderella story\\". Adaptation A three-part televised adaptation of the novel simply entitled I Was a Rat was aired on the BBC in 2001. The series was produced by Andy Rowley and directed by Laurie Lynd and was adapted by Richard Carpenter, who won a BAFTA award for the work.http://bafta.org/awards-database.html?sq=Richard+Carpenter  References  Category:1999 British novels Category:British fantasy novels Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:Novels adapted into television shows Category:Novels based on fairy tales Category:Novels by Philip Pullman Category:Works based on Cinderella Category:1999 children's books ","title":"I Was a Rat! or The Scarlet Slippers"},{"id":"13440410","text":"Revised Statute 2477 (commonly known as \\"RS 2477\\") was enacted by the United States Congress in 1866 to encourage the settlement of the Western United States by the development of a system of highways. Its entire text is one sentence: \\"the right-of-way for the construction of highways across public lands not otherwise reserved for public purposes is hereby granted.\\" The original grant did not require being recorded, meaning it was self-enacting, and in 1866 constructing a road often meant using a trail many times and perhaps filling low places, moving rocks and placing signs. It granted to counties and states a right-of-way across federal land when a highway was built. RS 2477 was repealed in 1976 under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA). The repeal was subject to \\"valid existing rights.\\" The relevant text (Sec. 701. 43 U.S.C. 1701) reads (a) \\"Nothing in this Act, or in any amendment made by this Act, shall be construed as terminating any valid lease, permit, patent, right-of-way, or other land use right or authorization existing on the date of approval of this Act\\".https://www.blm.gov/or/regulations/files/FLPMA.pdf Controversy Shared-access advocates claim that neither the BLM, Forest Service nor other federal agencies, nor even private landowners have the authority to close RS 2477 roads. Their interpretation of the statute has brought them into conflict with wilderness advocates, the federal government and private landowners. Conflicts on Federal Lands RS 2477 has become an issue for wilderness advocacy groups because of language in the Wilderness Act of 1964. According to Section 2 (c) 3, any area to be considered for wilderness status must contain \\"a least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition.\\" Section 4 (c) further specifies, \\"Except as specifically provided for in this Act, and subject to existing private rights, there shall be no commercial enterprise and no permanent road within any wilderness area designated by this Act\\".http://www.wildwilderness.org/docs/act1964.htm Thus an RS 2477 \\"highway\\" which qualifies as a \\"road\\" could disqualify the land it traverses from being recognized by the federal government as a \\"wilderness\\" if it reduced the area under consideration beneath the 5,000 acre limit. Access advocates have sometimes organized to reopen or maintain what they consider to be legitimate RS 2477 roads.http://www.off- road.com/offroad/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=294079 The Jarbidge Shovel Brigade is the best-known group that was formed for this purpose. Landowners, environmental organizations, government organizations (federal, state and county) and recreational-use advocates have very different understandings of the law. Conflicts among these groups came to a head when President Bill Clinton declared the Grand Staircase-Escalante, in southern Utah, to be a National Monument. Several Utah counties have been fighting in court to assert RS 2477 claims to roads that cross federal and private property (see SUWA v BLM), including across the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar recently authorized interior representatives to negotiate federal recognition of RS 2477 roads for which there is a clear historical record.http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/info/newsroom/2010/july/salazar_lays_groundwork.html In August 2010, quiet title of the Skutumpah Road, within the Grand Staircase- Escalante National Monument, (see Kane County, Utah v United States) was granted to Kane County, Utah.http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700061805/Kane-County-wins-its-first- RS-2477-road-2-the-Skutumpah.html Conflicts on Private Lands As western lands become developed into residential subdivisions, motorized recreationists and sportsmen are continuing to claim access rights on privately constructed, owned, and maintained roads that cross private land and gated communities. Because some disputed roads were never recorded by counties, shared-access groups claim that private landowners hold property with an unrecorded public right-of-way. Property rights advocates say that failure to record a right-of- way means that there was no intention to create a public right. Shared-access groups argue that lack of formal action by counties does not diminish the public’s easement/usufruct rights through private lands. They have engaged in threats, trespassing, and vandalism http://home.comcast.net/~balarat/ranch- vigilantes.html to vigorously assert those rights. Private property activists claim that nobody has access rights without a recorded easement. Shared-access activists claim that virtually all private land that used to be public can legally be traversed by the public. There is little common ground between these interpretation, so lawsuits are being fought in the western United States, and it has fallen to the courts to determine which routes are public and which are not. Courts have applied state laws, federal laws, and federal land court rulings to resolve RS 2477 claims. Recent examples of failed attempts to assert RS 2477 rights on private property are Galli v. Idaho County (Case Number CV 36692, Second Judicial District of Idaho, 2006) and Ramey v. Boslough (Case Number 02-CV-582, Boulder County District Court, 20th Judicial District of Colorado, 2007).

Because of similarities in churchmanship and doctrine, it is usually considered to be part of the Continuing Anglican movement, although the church's origins predate the start of that movement and it was publicly critical of the Continuing Anglican churches when they were founded during the late 1970s. History The church was founded by Episcopalians who withdrew from the Episcopal Church in 1963. The new jurisdiction was incorporated in the state of North Carolina in March 1964. Its founders intended to establish a conservative and low-church alternative to the Episcopal Church. Episcopal polity with apostolic succession were maintained with the consecration of its first bishop on Passion Sunday in 1964 by bishops of Eastern Orthodox and Old Catholic lineages. In 1999, Bishop Robert Godfrey and a majority of the church's clergy met in committee and determined to align the church more closely with the Continuing Anglican churches in worship style. A name change was also made. In opposition, lay leaders and standing committee close to the founding bishop and a small minority of the clergy subsequently started a new church and incorporated anew as the Anglican Orthodox Church International (AOCI). On April 30, 2000, Godfrey retired as Presiding Bishop in favor of his suffragan bishop, Scott Earle McLaughlin. In 2005, the jurisdiction changed its name from the Episcopal Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of America to the Orthodox Anglican Church. Godfrey and McLaughlin were signatories to the Bartonville Agreement in 1999. In 2007, McLaughlin signed a Covenant of Intercommunion between the OAC and the Old Catholic Church in Slovakia, represented by the Most Revd Augustin Bacinsky.A Covenant Between The Old Catholic Church In Slovakia and the Orthodox Anglican Church April 25, 2007. The Old Catholic Church of Slovakia seceded from the Utrecht Union in 2004 because of the Union's approval of women's ordination and same-sex blessings. On Ash Wednesday 2012, McLaughlin announced his retirement and the nomination of Creighton Jones of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to be his successor. That nomination was confirmed by the General Convention on June 9, 2012. Jones was consecrated as a bishop and enthroned as the presiding bishop and metropolitan archbishop on July 21, 2012, at the Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. In 2014, the church celebrated 50 years as a jurisdiction of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church and also marked the 50th anniversary of its incorporation in the state of North Carolina (March 6, 2014). On November 16, 2014, Archbishop Jones announced his retirement and nominated his suffragan, Thomas Gordon, to be his successor. On April 18, 2015 a special general convention of the church was held and delegates from the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico unanimously approved of the nomination. Thomas E. Gordon was enthroned the same day as the sixth Presiding Bishop of the Orthodox Anglican Church and Metropolitan of the Orthodox Anglican Communion. Parishes The Orthodox Anglican Church has 17 churches and missions in the United States and Puerto Rico. Institutions Saint Andrew's Theological College and Seminary was founded by the Orthodox Anglican Church in 1971. The Orthodox Anglican Church's offices are in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Nottoway Indian Tribe of Virginia and the Cheroenhaka (Nottoway) Tribe are distinct, with separate identities. Each of the contemporary tribes received state recognition in February 2010.SJ12 Nottoway Indian Tribe; extending state recognition thereto and grants representation on VCI., Legislative Information SystemSJ127 Cheroenhaka (Nottoway) Indian Tribe; extending state recognition thereto, representation on VCI., Legislative Information System They were among several Virginia tribes that were deprived of their land during the colonial era and their records were distorted during the early 20th century. The Cheroenhaka (Nottoway) Indian Tribe has filed their letter of intent to petition for federal recognition and hope to receive federal recognition soon. The Chickahominy, Eastern Chickahominy, Rappahanock, Nansemond, Monacan, and Upper Mattaponi received federal recognition in January 2018. The Pamunkey tribe was granted federal recognition in 2015. Four state-recognized tribes in Virginia are still seeking federal recognition: the Nottoway Indian Tribe, Cheroenhaka (Nottoway) Tribe, Mattaponi Indian tribe and Reservation, and Patawomeck tribe. Name The meaning of the name Cheroenhaka (in Tuscarora: Čiruʼęhá·ka·ʼRudes, Blair A. Tuscarora English Dictionary Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999) is uncertain. (It has been spelled in various ways: Cherohakah, Cheroohoka or Tcherohaka.) The late Iroquoian scholar Blair A. Rudes analyzed the second element as -hakaʼ meaning \\"one or people who is/are characterized in a certain way\\". He conjectured that the first element of the name was related to the Tuscarora term čárhuʼ (meaning \\"tobacco\\", as both tribes used this product in ceremonies).Rudes, Blair, Sketch of the Nottoway Language from a Historical-Comparative Perspective, University of Chicago Press, 1981. The term has also been interpreted as \\"People at the Fork of the Stream\\".Cheroenhaka Nottoway Indian Tribe History The term Nottoway may derive from Nadawa or Nadowessioux (widely translated as \\"poisonous snake\\"), an Algonquian-language term. Algonquian tribes occupied the coastal areas and used this term to refer to the Iroquoian- or Siouan-speaking tribes of the interior, with whom they competed. Because the Algonquian occupied the coastal areas, they were the first tribes met by the English. The colonists often adopted use of such Algonquian ethnonyms, names for other tribes, not realizing at first that these differed from the tribes' autonyms, or names for themselves. Frank Siebert suggests the term natowewa stems from Proto- Algonquian *na:tawe:wa and refers to the Massasauga, a pit viper of the Great Lakes region. The extension of the meaning as \\"Iroquoian speakers\\" is secondary. In Algonquian languages beyond the geographical range of the viper (i.e. Cree–Innu–Naskapi and Eastern Algonquian), the term's primary reference continues to focus on *na:t- 'close upon, mover towards, go after, seek out, fetch' and *-awe: 'condition of heat, state of warmth,' but no longer refers to the viper. Instead, particularly in the South, the 'Iroquoian' designation is primary. The semantic meaning may not relate to snakes at all, but refer to the cultural trading position of the Virginia-Carolina Iroquois as middle men between Algonquian and Siouan speakers. Other historical developments in Algonquian languages extend the meaning of *-awe to 'fur or hair' (i.e. Cree, Innu, Ojibway, Shawnee), an obvious relationship to 'state of warmth.' A potential etymology in Virginia of *na:tawe:wa (Nottoway) refers to *na:t- 'seeker' + -awe: 'fur,'Siebert, Frank T. (1996) Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 38, No.4, pp. 635–642. or literally 'traders'Woodard, Buck (2010). Ethnographic View of the Nottoway, 1700–1750 The earliest colonial Virginia reference to \\"Nottoway\\" also frames Algonquian/Iroquoian exchanges in terms of trade: roanoke (shell beads) for skins (deer and otter).Bland, Edward (1650). The Discovery of New Brittaine The Algonquian speakers also referred to the Nottoway, Meherrin and Tuscarora people (also of the Iroquoian-language family) as Mangoak or Mangoags, a term which English colonists used in their records from 1584 to 1650. This term, Mengwe or Mingwe, was transliterated by the Dutch and applied to the Iroquoian Susquehannock (\\"White Minquas\\") and Erie people (\\"Black Minquas\\"). Another variation was the later term Mingo, which English-speaking colonists and settlers used to refer to descendants of remnant tribes who had been partly assimilated into the Six Nations of the Iroquois and later migrated into Ohio and the Midwest. Language The Nottoway language became extinct well before 1900.Rudes, Sketch of the Nottoway Language. At the time of European contact (1650), speakers numbered only in the hundreds. From then until 1735, a number of colonists learned the language and acted as official interpreters for the Colony of Virginia, including Thomas Blunt, Henry Briggs, and Thomas Wynn. These interpreters also served the adjacent Meherrin, as well as the Nansemond, who spoke Nottoway in addition to their own Algonquian dialect of Powhatan.Helen Rountree, Pocahontas's People p. 108. The last two interpreters were dismissed in 1735, since the Nottoway by then were using English. By 1820, three elderly speakers of Nottoway were said to remain.Rudes, Sketch of.... In that year John Wood collected over 250 word samples from one of these, Chief \\"Queen\\" Edith Turner. He sent them to Thomas Jefferson, who shared them with Peter Stephen Du Ponceau. In their correspondence, these two men quickly confirmed that the Nottoway language was of the Iroquoian family. Several additional words, for a total of about 275, were collected by James Trezvant after 1831, and published by Albert Gallatin in 1836. In the early 20th century, John Napoleon Brinton Hewitt (1910) and Hoffman (1959) analyzed the Nottoway vocabulary in comparison with Tuscarora, also Iroquoian, and found them closely related. The Tuscarora had lived in North Carolina, likely migrating there from the Great Lakes area thousands of years before. Due to warfare and colonial pressure in the early eighteenth century, most of the surviving Tuscarora migrated north to New York to seek protection by alliance with the Iroquois Confederacy. They were accepted as its Sixth Nation. They declared their migration ended in 1722, and said that Tuscarora living elsewhere were no longer considered members of the tribe. A significant population in North Carolina claim descent from the Tuscarora and identify by that name. Since the early 2000s, the Cheroenhaka (Nottoway) Indian Tribe has been working hard to revitalize their traditional language, using Tuscarora vocabulary and grammar. The two languages are mutually intelligible and vary only in terms of dialect. History  The Nottoway, like their close Iroquoian neighbours, the Meherrin and Tuscarora, lived just west of the Fall Line in the Piedmont region. English explorer Edward Bland is believed to have been the first European to encounter them, when he made an expedition from Fort Henry. He noted meeting them in his journal for August 27, 1650. At the time, the people numbered no more than 400–500. Bland visited two of their three towns, on Stoney Creek and the Rowantee Branch of the Nottoway River, in what is now Sussex County. These towns were led by the brothers Oyeocker and Chounerounte. The Nottoway and Meherrin became friendly with the English. They were the only tribes to send warriors to help the English against the Susquehannock (also an Iroquoian tribe) in 1675. Following Bacon's Rebellion, both tribes signed the Treaty of 1677, becoming Tributary Nations to the Colony of Virginia. By 1681, hostile tribes caused the Nottoway to relocate southward to Assamoosick Swamp in modern Surry County. In 1694 they moved again, to the mouth of a swamp in what is now Southampton County. Around this time, they absorbed the remnants of the Eno — an Algonquian-speaking tribe that had formerly been part of the Powhatan confederacy.Thomas C. Parramore, 1978, Southampton County p.1-5. In the early 1700s, the Nottoway also absorbed a group of Nansemond known as the \\"Traditional Nansemond.\\" The Nansemond were the only Powhatan tribe that regularly traded with the Nottoway and spoke the Nottoway language. In a court case against tribal treasurer Jeremiah Cobb in 1849-1852, James and Jincy Taylor were identified as headmen who led the \\"Nottoway and Nansemond Tribe of Indians.\\" Although never numerous, the Nottoway maintained cultural continuity. They did not disappear from records identified as Indian, merge into other tribes, or get pushed too far from their original homeland. Scholars believe the early Nottoway were similar in culture to the Tuscarora and Meherrin. The Nottoway, much like the Tuscarora, consisted of 7 clans: Wolf, Deer, Eel, Beaver, Bear, Snipe, and Turtle. The tribe depended on the cultivation of staples, such as the three sisters — varieties of maize, squash, and beans. The cultivation and processing of crops was typically done by women, who also selected and preserved varieties of seeds to produce different types of crops. The men hunted game and fished in the rivers. They built multi-family dwellings known as longhouses in communities which they protected by stockade fences known as palisades. The Nottoway suffered high fatalities from epidemics of new Eurasian diseases, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity. These accompanied European contact, as the diseases were by then endemic among Europeans. Tribal warfare and encroaching colonists also reduced the population. When the Tuscarora migrated northward ca. 1720 to become the Sixth Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy in New York, some Nottoway also migrated there, while others remained in Virginia. It is likely that some descendants of the Iroquois nations, especially among the Tuscarora and Oneida, with whom they lived in New York and Canada, also have Nottoway ancestry. Some Nottoway returned to the South, with bands of Tuscarora and Meherrin joining and merging with them. These groups went to South Carolina. In the 21st century, some common surnames among the Nottoway are Turner, Woodson, Rogers/Roger, Bozeman, Wineoak, Weaver, Bass, Step, Skipper, Kersey, Bennett, Blount, Scholar, Robins, Williams/Will, Edmunds, Bartlett, Bailey, Gabriel, Pearch, Kello, Walden, John, and Taylor.

It has an eight-octave range from C0 to C8. For 90 years it was the only concert grand piano in the world with 97 keys, until it was joined in 1990 by the instruments of Stuart & Sons of Australia. Music critic Melinda Bargreen has described the Imperial as the ne plus ultra of pianos, while pianist Garrick Ohlsson dubbed it the \\"Rolls- Royce of pianos\\".\\"Piano Versus Piano\\", The New York Times, May 9, 2004. Retrieved March 23, 2008.  Extra keys  Bösendorfer built the first Imperial in 1909, following a suggestion by composer Ferruccio Busoni to build a model with an extended range. Busoni sought to extend the range to accommodate his transcription of Johann Sebastian Bach's organ works. In order to emulate the 32 foot registers available on some large organs, he needed the entire octave down to C0. The Bösendorfer Imperial features 97 keys: a full eight octaves. This is in contrast to their other extended model, the Bösendorfer 225, which has 92 keys (down to F0). The extra keys, which are all at the bass end of the keyboard (that is, to the left), are colored black so that the pianist can tell them apart from the normal keys of an 88-key piano. They were originally covered with a removable panel to prevent a pianist from accidentally playing the extra notes. While the keys are seldom used, the extra bass strings create additional harmonic resonance that contributes to an overall richer sound. Compositions have been written specifically to utilize the extra keys. Pianist and University of Washington School of Music director Robin McCabe explains the challenge of adjusting to the extra keys: \\"One's 'southern sight-lines,' so to speak, can be seriously skewed because of the extra footage in the bass. Ending a piece such as Debussy's L'isle joyeuse, for example, with its nose-dive final gesture to the low A of the piano, becomes a bit more problematic when that A is not the lowest note on the piano!\\" Reportedly, \\"[the] 290 has proved a bit of a temperamental star, sounding harsh and jarring in the hands of pianists who do not understand how to play it and marvellously refined in the hands of those who do\\". Pricing and availability Bösendorfer Imperial Concert Grand pianos, handcrafted in Austria, retail for between US$256,000 and $560,000 in the U.S., depending on finish, design and whether the Disklavier Enspire computer reproducing system is installed. (Bösendorfer's CEUS reproducing system, \\"Create Emotions with Unique Sound\\", developed in-house, is more expensive still.) In 1977, the price was reported to be $35,000, $ in current value. While the concert piano market is dominated by Steinway & Sons, which signs prominent artists to a performance agreement and urges them to refrain from playing any other piano brand, performers preferring the Bösendorfer Imperial will often have that piano shipped with them while on tour.

The engine's development was terminated in November 1958. Design and development In March 1953, the United States Air Force released General Operational Requirement (GOR) 16, which called air- and ground-launched decoy missiles to increase the effectiveness of Strategic Air Command bombers by confusing and saturating an air defense system. In December 1955, Fairchild was awarded a contract to develop the ground-launched decoy Weapon System 123A which included the XSM-73 Goose. McDonnell Aircraft was chosen in February 1956 to build the ADM-20 Quail air-launched decoy. Two engine contracts were awarded in November 1954 to minimize development risk for both decoys. Each engine was in the 2,450 lbf (10.9 kN) thrust class with a thrust to weight ratio goal of 10:1. General Electric was awarded a contract for the development of the J85 and Fairchild was awarded a contract for a competing engine, the J83. Fairchild proposed a lightweight engine of conventional design. GE used a more advanced design which yielded a higher thrust to weight ratio. A J83 was operating by early 1957. A B-57 Canberra was modified and used as a flying engine testbed for the J83. The J83 powered the XSM-73 Goose on 15 test flights. Fairchild competed with two other engine manufacturers to provide the powerplant for the Canadair Tutor. A license-built J85 was chosen. The Northrop XQ-4A, was developed to use the J83 engine, but when the engine could not be developed in time the XQ-4A was canceled. In November 1958, the J83 was canceled one month before the XSM-73. The USAF determined that the J85 had a higher probability of meeting the desired performance goals. The J85 could also be used to power the ADM-20 Quail decoy, the XSM-73 missile, and the T-38 Talon trainer. The J83 could only be used to power the XSM-73. After the J83 was canceled, Fairchild had no other applications for the engine. As a result, operations at the Fairchild Engine Division plant at Deer Park in Long Island ended in the summer of 1959. The McDonnell 119, an unsuccessful early business jet, was originally designed in 1957 to use the J83, but McDonnell had to modify the prototype to accept the Westinghouse J34 after the termination of the J83 program.

It is located in the municipality of Rakovica. It is also called Lake Resnik.  Location  The lake is located southeast of the center of Resnik, from downtown Belgrade, from the European route E70 and from the Belgrade bypass.  Geography  Pariguz is created in the valley of the stream of the same name. It also receives waters from the seven springs, with another spring flowing from the surrounding forest. The lake covers and area of , it is long, wide and up to , deep, while the average depth is . The water is cooler than the water in Ada Ciganlija and does not warm up higher than . Pariguz stream empties into the Topčiderska reka, which makes the lake part of the Black Sea drainage basin.  Name  The name of the stream and the lake is unusual, and in modern Serbian the meaning would be the „buttock steamer“. Origin of the name is not known for sure. There are two concurring stories, both of which are generally considered as the cases of the folk etymology. One says that, during the First Serbian Uprising in the beginning of the 19th century, a company of Serbs attacked a group of Turkish soldiers nearby and, as the Serbian saying goes, Serbs „dusted buttocks“ of the Turks with the bullets. The other says that the bottom of the valley of the Pariguz stream was covered with healing mud, which even the ancient Romans used for treating the hemorrhoids. In the official documentation of the project which envisioned the arrangement of the lake from 2020, the name Lake Resnik was used instead of Pariguz.  History  The lake was created in 1989, when the stream was dammed to prevent the floods in the drainage bassin of the Topčiderska reka. A proper road to the lake was built in the spring of 2010. In 1999, during the NATO bombing of Serbia, the lake was drained, its bed was cleaned, and then refilled. Unconfirmed stories claimed that the reason was an unexploded NATO bomb which fell into the lake.  Wildlife  Lake is inhabited by the mallards, partridges and terrapins. Water is populated by the rich fish fauna, including wels catfish, common carp, Prussian carp, European chub, brown bullhead and northern pike.  Future  For years there are plans for the construction of the tourist complex, which would become the „Ada Ciganlija“ of Rakovica. The complex would include beaches, sports terrains and restaurants. Before that, the lake needs to be cleaned again as the waste waters from the closest houses drain into the lake, even though the chemical analysis conducted in 2012 showed that the water can be used for swimming, though the quality is not great. Shores of the lake were cleaned in March 2016. Another problem is the ownership of the land around the lake. Municipality owns the land up to from the shore, and much wider area is needed for the complex. Plans also include bicycle paths which would connect Pariguz to the other tourist attractions of Belgrade: Košutnjak, Pionirski Grad, Avala, Topčider. However, as of 2017 no work has been done on the lake. In August 2017 the idea of sports complex on the lake was revived as the project Jezero (\\"lake\\"). Additions to the previous plans include the hotel , spa center, swimming pools, sports hall, etc., all on the area of around the lake. It turned out that the major problem is caused by five high voltage overhead power lines (110 and 120 kV) which crisscross the area. It is forbidden to build anything beneath them, to spend time, to swim or to fish. The lake is popular among the fishermen and is expected to become a popular swimming location and this causes a huge problem, so the planners say that the swimming and fishing probably won't be strictly forbidden, but people will be advised not to do it. On the lots which are directly beneath the power lines, a protective green zones will be created, wider than . On them, even the open sports fields will not be allowed. Another limitation in the planning is the major gas pipeline which traverses the area, too. A new road will be built. It will reach the lake from the north, as the continuation of Resnik's Brestovačka street, and should spread above the future complex. It will end with the parking lot and the roundabout of the future public transportation bus line. Instead of the present, narrow road which reaches the lake from the west, a communal path will be constructed, with the sewage system below so that waste waters wouldn't flow into the lake anymore. The path will be used only by the police and ambulance. A bicycle path will encircle the lake, passing through the thick forest on the southern side of the lake. A pedestrian bridge will be constructed across the lake, too. Neither the timeline for the project, nor the investors, have been disclosed and the city assembly should decide on the project by the end of 2017. Plans were adopted in 2018 and by the end of the year, the lake was mapped in detail in order for the purification program to be drafted. Preparatory works began in October 2019. New additions to the project include relocation of the overhead power lines. In April 2020 it was announced that the works on the first phase will last from May to July, when the pontoon was placed in the lake, and the parking lot was finished.

When the Rochester Ladies' Anti Slavery Society asked Douglass for a short story to go in their collection, Autographs for Freedom, Douglass responded with The Heroic Slave. The novella, published in 1852 by John P. Jewett and Company, was Douglass' first and only published work of fiction (though he did publish several autobiographical narratives). The Heroic Slave is a fictional work inspired by the Creole case, in which Madison Washington, an enslaved cook on the brig Creole led a ship-board rebellion by 19 slaves in November 1841. They succeeded in taking control of the ship en route from Virginia to New Orleans (known as the coastwise slave trade), and ordered it sailed to Nassau, Bahamas, a British port. A total of 135 slaves gained freedom there, as Britain had abolished slavery in 1839. It was the largest and most successful slave rebellion in United States history. Plot Part I opens as Madison Washington carries a heavy load through the woods, lamenting his condition under slavery. Mr. Listwell, a free white man, secretly watches him in silence. In Part II, the story moves ahead five years. Mr. Listwell is sitting at the table with his wife when they hear a knock at the door. Madison Washington is running from slavery, and Mr. Listwell is more than willing to help him escape. As they talk, Mr. Listwell tells Madison he remembers him from so many years before, and asks him where he has been all of this time. Madison reveals that on the day Mr. Listwell saw him, he left his wife and children to escape and seek freedom. Unable to find his way to the North, a week later he returned to his plantation. He met with his wife who regularly gave him food and provision, and for five years hid in the woods. However, a great fire caused Madison to lose his hiding place, which is why he ran to see Mr. Listwell. Mr. Listwell gives Madison a new coat and provisions and helps him escape to Canada. In Part III, Mr. Listwell is in a tavern and reveals that he has traveled that day. As he drinks, he sees a slave-gang on their way to market, and is surprised to see Madison Washington among the slaves. Madison reveals that he reached Canada, but he missed his wife so much that he returned to the United States to help her escape. He reached her bedroom window, but he scared her so much that she woke up her master. The couple were chased by the master and his dogs. His wife was shot down and killed and he had been sold to traders who would take him to the Deep South. Mr. Listwell realizes there's nothing he can do for Madison in these conditions, but implores the man to put his trust in God. As he is leaving, Mr. Listwell buys 3 files; he gives them and $10 secretly to Madison. Part III ends with Madison taken aboard a ship, put in chains together with other slaves, and sailing to the South for re-sale. In Part IV, white men speak about \\"unfortunate\\" events that occurred aboard the ship Creole. Madison Washington gained the trust of all of the overseers on board and, using the files Mr. Listwell had given him, cuts through his fetters and leads the slaves in rebellion. Nineteen slaves survived the battle. Madison took over as captain of the ship, ordering it sailed to Nassau, in the British colony of the Bahamas. Britain had abolished slavery there in 1834. In Nassau, a group of black soldiers declared that they only protected property, and people were not property, so the nineteen slaves were freed.  Editions * Douglass, Frederick.

Pionium, a bound state of two oppositely-charged pions, is interesting for exploring the strong interaction. This should also be true of protonium. The true analogs of positronium in the theory of strong interactions are the quarkonium states: they are mesons made of a heavy quark and antiquark (namely, charmonium and bottomonium). Exploration of these states through non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) and lattice QCD are increasingly important tests of quantum chromodynamics.

Early life and education Caldera was born on 19 August 1937. Completely blind at the age of 14, he attended the Seeduwa Deaf and Blind School. There, Caldera studied under maestro Sunil Shantha, who conducted classes for blind students. After leaving school, Caldera continued to learn from Shantha at his house in Dehiyagatha, Ja-Ela. Career Caldera became a radio artist in 1968 and recorded his first hit song Thara Petia in 1972. He subsequently released a four song album in 1977. During his lifetime he released three audio cassettes and two compact discs. Most his songs were solos, and children's songs; it is said that Caldera often sang for his own children and grandchildren. Honors In 1979, the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Ranasinghe Premadasa, donated a house for Caldera to live. In 1993, Caldera received a Kala Bhushana award (the second highest award granted by the state to performing artists). Student bodies at several universities and non-governmental organizations honored him in appreciation of his service to folk music. Personal life, and death Caldera firmly believed that art is art and nothing could buy an artist; he held on to this belief until he died. Caldera had four children with his wife, who was also blind. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2004 and died on 11 October 2006. Caldera's second son, Chaminda, sings in his memory.

Aiptasia is a widely distributed genus of temperate and tropical sea anemones of benthic lifestyle typically found living on mangrove roots and hard substrates. These anemones, as well as many other cnidarian species, often contain symbiotic dinoflagellate unicellular algae of the genus Symbiodinium living inside nutritive cells. The symbionts provide food mainly in the form of lipids and sugars produced from photosynthesis to the host while the hosts provides inorganic nutrients and a constant and protective environment to the algae. Species of Aiptasia are relatively weedy anemones able to withstand a relatively wide range of salinities and other water quality conditions. In the case of A. pallida and A. pulchella, their hardiness coupled with their ability to reproduce very quickly and out-compete other species in culture gives these anemones the status of pest from the perspective of coral reef aquarium hobbyists. These very characteristics make them easy to grow in the laboratory and thus they are extensively used as model organisms for scientific study. In this respect, Aiptasia have contributed a significant amount of knowledge regarding cnidarian biology, especially human understanding of cnidarian-algal symbioses, a biological phenomenon crucial to the survival of corals and coral reef ecosystems. The dependence of coral reefs on the health of the symbiosis is dramatically illustrated by the devastating effects experienced by corals due to the loss of algal symbionts in response to environmental stress, a phenomenon known as coral bleaching.  Species  Species in the genus Aiptasia include: *Aiptasia californica Carlgren, 1952 *Aiptasia couchii (Cocks, 1851) *Aiptasia diaphana (Rapp, 1829) *Aiptasia insignis Carlgren, 1941 *Aiptasia inula (Duchassaing & Michelotti, 1864) *Aiptasia leiodactyla Pax, 1910 *Aiptasia mimosa (Duchassaing & Michelotti, 1864) *Aiptasia minuta (Verrill, 1866) *Aiptasia mutabilis (Gravenhorst, 1831) *Aiptasia prima (Stephenson, 1918) *Aiptasia pulchella Carlgren, 1943 *Aiptasia tagetes (Duchassaing & Michelotti, 1864) Morphology Cnidarian species are found in one of two body forms: the polyp and the medusae. Some alternate between these two forms during their life cycle. In the case of Aiptasia, and all anthozoans, the body form is the polyp. The body is composed of a pedal disc with which Aiptasia attaches to the substrate, a smooth and elongated body column and an oral disc which bears the mouth and long stinging tentacles. Reproduction Aiptasia can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Asexual reproduction occurs when a small segment is separated from the pedal disk. A single cell can be enough for a new Aiptasia anemone to form. The separated segment will start growing and develop a new polyp. A new polyp is usually formed within 14 days. The new polyps are clones of the original Aiptasia. Aiptasia diaphana can produce both male and female offspring through asexual reproduction. Some clones even develop into hermaphrodites. Sexual reproduction in the well-studied Aiptasia pallida and Aiptasia pulchella, is dioecious, meaning that individual Aiptasia are of separate sexes. During spawning, anemones release their gametes into the water where fertilization occurs. The resulting zygote becomes a free swimming planula larva which eventually settles onto a suitable substrate where it undergoes metamorphosis to become a small polyp. Newly produced larvae are aposymbiotic meaning they do not contain symbionts. The larvae or newly settled polyps can acquire symbiotic algae from the environment. External factors affect the method of reproductions. Asexual reproduction is used more when conditions are bad. Sexual reproduction is used when conditions are good. In the aquarium Aiptasia sp. are considered pests in the marine aquarium hobby, because they are stressful to coral around them, and occasionally even sting fish and desirable invertebrates. They are often accidentally imported along with live rock. Once present in the aquarium, the polyps are notoriously difficult to remove as attempts to remove often inadvertently create more, due to new polyps regenerating from remnants. Hobbyists commonly put peppermint shrimp or certain species of filefish or butterfly fish inside the aquarium to control Aiptasia populations, as the arthropods regularly prey on small cnidarian polyps. The nudibranch Aeolidiella stephanieae, is considered one of the best predators for Aiptasia sp. This species used to be called and is still commonly referred to as Berghia verrucicornis. A few of the more popular fish considered for controlling aiptasia are Acreichthys tomentosus, the bristletail filefish; Chelmon rostratus, the copperband butterflyfish; and Chaetodon kleinii, the sunburst butterflyfish; however these fish are potentially detrimental to other, desirable, sessile invertebrates.

It reached the height of its popularity in the 1980s, especially in rural areas.Mary Farquharson, Mexico. The Rough Guide to World Music, Rough Guides, 2000, p. 472. The music has roots in the rock groups of the 1960s, but today generally consists of four or more musicians using electric guitars, keyboards and drums. The music increased in popularity in the 1990s and became commercially viable, and is now recognized in some Latin music awards ceremonies such as Lo Nuestro and The Latin Grammy Awards. Grupero artists typically perform rancheras, corridos, cumbias, ballads, boleros and chilenas/huapangos. History The original wave of Mexican rock bands got their start mostly with Spanish covers of popular English rock songs. After this initial stage, they moved on to include in their repertoire traditional ranchera songs, in addition to cumbias and ballads. Thus, the 1970s saw the rise of a number of grupera bands that specialized in romantic ballads and songs that up to that point had only been sung with mariachi.

The Grand Lodge of Kansas is headquartered at Topeka, Kansas. History In 1854, three Wyandot Indians and five white settlers – all of whom were Masons – coalesced in what is now Wyandotte County, Kansas, and petitioned the Grand Lodge of Missouri to establish a Lodge of Masons in a Wyandot Indian village. On August 4, 1854, the dispensation was granted and one week later Kansas Lodge U.D. (eventually to become Wyandotte Lodge No. 3) opened for work. Within two years, two other lodges in Kansas were formed and in 1856 the trio formed the Grand Lodge of Kansas as America's Civil War loomed.Grand Lodge of Kansas website Notably, the first master of Kansas Lodge U.D. was John Milton Chivington, a Methodist missionary to the Wyandot and a vocal opponent of slavery. Chivington left Kansas in 1860, became an officer in the Union army and was later celebrated as a hero for his part in the Battle of Glorieta Pass (1862). His orchestration of the Sand Creek Massacre (1864), however, earned him universal condemnation and ultimately made him infamous.Morton, Julius S., Illustrated History of Nebraska, Vol. 2 (1906), 192.

Hafiz was a right-handed middle order batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He died in Manhattan during the September 11 attacks. Cricket career Hafiz's name is located on Panel N-6 of the National September 11 Memorial’s North Pool. Having played cricket from a young age, Hafiz captained the Guyana Under-19 cricket team in the 1988 Northern Telecom Youth Tournament, a tournament with other under-19 teams from the West Indies. His first match as under-19 captain came against Trinidad and Tobago Under-19s, captained by Brian Lara. Hafiz made his first-class debut later that year for Demerara in the final of the 1988/89 Guystac Trophy against Berbice, with the match ending in a draw. His debut for Guyana against Barbados in that same seasons Red Stripe Cup. Struggling to find a regular starting place in what was a strong Guyana team of the 1980s and early 1990s, he made four further first-class appearances for Guyana, the last of which came against the Leeward Islands. In his five first-class matches for Guyana, he scored 40 runs at an average of 10.00, with a high score of 30. He made two List A appearances for his home country, with both coming in the 1988/89 Geddes Grant Shield against the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands. He joined his parents and two older sisters in New York in 1992, prior to his departure he donated his cricket equipment to his local cricket club in Georgetown. Following his relocation to the United States, Hafiz went on to play a single List A match for the United States national cricket team against the Leeward Islands when the United States were invited to take part in the 1998–99 Red Stripe Bowl. In his only major appearance for the United States, he was absent hurt in their batting innings. He also toured England with the United States team in 2000.

In the 25 years after its inception in 1976, the SII granted its Certificate of Liberal Arts to approximately 1,000 students.J. Schall, S.J., \\"The St. Ignatius Institute\\", National Catholic Register (January 20, 2001) During these years the SII generated both controversy and accolades due to its greater advocacy for Catholic doctrine within a diverse, more liberal Jesuit institution.  Founding and Great Books curriculum  In 1976 a group of educatorsThe group included John Galten, Fr Francis P. Filice, the Rev. Brian Mullady, OP, et al. founded what their leader, the Rev. Joseph Fessio, S.J., called \\"a completely integrated liberal arts program in the Jesuit tradition.\\"Cornelius M. Buckley, \\"The Saint Ignatius Institute: A Traditional Catholic College,\\" in America, March 25, 1978. Fessio described SII as adhering to a more traditional Jesuit approach to education.Cornelius M. Buckley, Ibid; See also: comments by SII Director, Thomas O'Neill, S.J., in Todd Wouters,\\"A Changing Environment at USF forces Jesuits to Redefine Their Educational Mission,\\" San Francisco Foghorn (Oct. 26, 2006) The four-year-long sequence of studies in the liberal arts was designed to follow a method of seminars and lectures based on the students' reading of the Great Books of the Western World, in a roughly historical order.\\"Institute and University Move Forward Together,\\" USF News 10:8 (Apr. 11, 2001]: \\"The 25-year-old St. Ignatius Institute, with 150 students currently enrolled, is a unique Great Books program rooted in the Catholic tradition. Courses are taught by College of Arts and Sciences faculty through seminars with accompanying lecture courses, organized in historical sequence, in literature, philosophy, and theology.\\" The reading list mostly resembled those at other undergraduate colleges offering Great Books programs such as St. John's CollegeSt. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, and at Thomas Aquinas College, in Santa Paula, California. SII students would read and discuss the same works from the official reading list of Great Books authors chosen for their impact on the intellectual life of Western Civilization, from various religious and philosophical traditions. For instance, in their first semester, freshmen read works by ancient Greeks and Semites, including Homer, Aristophanes, Sappho, and the Epic of Gilgamesh.St. Ignatius Institute Prospectus(1984) At the same time, the SII also drew upon and emphasized Roman Catholic contributions to the Western tradition, as represented by such Catholic authors as the early Church Fathers, St. Augustine, Boethius, St. Thomas Aquinas, Dante, Chaucer and Miguel de Cervantes, as well as more recent Catholic thinkers like John Henry Newman, G. K. Chesterton, and the fathers of the Second Vatican Council. Like Thomas Aquinas College, the SII espoused academic freedom by not limiting admissions to applicants of any religious or philosophical belief.As a program within the University of San Francisco, the SII followed the University's non-discrimination policy, as stated in the official USF catalog: \\"The University of San Francisco admits students of any race, religion, sex, color, handicap, national and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, national and/or ethnic origin in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarships....\\" in University of San Francisco 1984-85 Catalog, p. 7 Students tended to be Catholic, but some non-Catholics became students\\"SI Institute: Complex Tapestry,\\" USF Monday Bulletin (Dec. 7, 1987): \\"Most of the 157 students are Catholic; fewer than 10 percent are not.\\" and faculty members. Unlike some other institutions with Great Books curricula, the SII operates within a larger university and does not constitute an alternative to the obligatory major that USF students declare before graduation. The original program was strong in the humanities (languages, literature, composition (language), philosophy, theology) but had a weaker offering in mathematics and the natural sciences.\\"St. Ignatius Institute,\\" in The University of San Francisco Catalogue, 1984 Students who fulfilled the requirements of the SII were awarded a Certificate in the Liberal Arts, by which USF and the SII certified that the student had achieved USF's core education requirements toward an undergraduate degree.\\"Institute and University Move Forward Together,\\", USF News 10:8 (Apr. 11, 2001) Controversies For its first quarter-century, the SII was a lightning rod of controversy within the university and among more progressive members of the Roman Catholic Church. Some members of the university criticized what one scholar called a \\"parti pris\\"The phrase was that of the university theologian and critic of the SII, Fr. Bernadicou, see: \\"St. Ignatius Institute founder fired, future uncertain,\\" National Catholic Register, July 12, 1987, p. 9: Bernadicou asks: \\"Does the program, as it's now oriented, do justice to the classics they read or are they read from a parti pris position? Do they let the books speak for themselves?\\" approach to education with a narrow Catholic – mostly papal – perspective. Faculty of the SII clashed with members and friends of USF's Department of Theology who objected to SII's practice of hiring theology professors for SII classes rather than relying upon the Department of Theology to provide these faculty.University of San Francisco College of Arts and Sciences, \\"Department of Theology and Religious Studies Self-Study\\", (April 2004) The SII rejected interference by the Department of Theology because it wanted to maintain a strong adherence to theological positions loyal to the current Pope and Magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church, especially on moral matters such as contraception, abortion, and homosexuality.K. Yamanouchi, \\"Students, staff protest consolidation of Jesuit institute, The Washington Times, March 31, 2001, p. A11 Eventually the differences between the SII and the Department of Theology were symbolized by their contrasting responses to Ex Corde Ecclesiae issued by Pope John Paul II in 1990.Apostolic Constitution On Catholic Universities The papal document called for a mandatum to be signed by professors of Catholic doctrine as a testament to the instructor's orthodoxy. The SII faculty signed the mandatum as a self-defining act.The Associated Press, \\"At Catholic university, conservatives feel silenced\\", The Berkeley Daily Planet (March 25, 2001) But USF and the Department of Theology resisted signing the mandatum, as did theologians in many other U.S. Catholic universities in a controversy that continued for over a decade.Pamela Schaeffer,\\"Down to the wire: the mandatum debate - license to teach Catholic theology\\", National Catholic Reporter (June 15, 2001) Various events also sparked debate, with the SII's continued existence frequently called into question. In 1978, the SII hosted a symposiumHumanae Vitae: Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Pope Paul VI, Fifteenth Anniversary Commemorative Edition (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, July 1983), prepared by the Rev. Marc Caligari, S.J., \\"on the occasion of the symposium of July, 1978, sponsored by the Archdiocese of San Francisco and by the St. Ignatius Institute of the University of San Francisco commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Encyclical's promulgation,\\" p. 4 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the promulgation of Humanae Vitae, the encyclical by Pope Paul VI condemning contraception.\\"Letter of The Holy Father Paul VI, signed by the Secretary of State, to Msgr. John Raphael Quinn, Archbishop of San Francisco\\", 21 July 1978 British journalist Malcolm Muggeridge delivered the keynote address, arguing that contraception is a lethal threat to Christian civilization. Another speaker, Fr. Gerald Coleman, dean of St. Patrick's Seminary, Menlo Park, California, delivered a paper for the minority at the symposium, expressing opposition to the keynote address and arguing for \\"allowing theological dissent and reception of communion by couples practicing artificial birth control.\\"\\"Humanae Vitae's Tenth Anniversary\\", Fellowship of Catholic Scholars Newsletter, 1:4 (Sept. 1978) p.2 In 1987, USF's campus minister denied access on Sundays for the SII's popular but controversial chaplain, Fr. Cornelius M. Buckley, to celebrate Mass, alleging that his liturgies fostered a cult-like following. Critics of the decision expressed regret at the loss of variety in styles of liturgical worship at USF caused by the campus minister's ruling. Some described Buckley's liturgical approach as more \\"simple\\" and \\"solemn.\\"E. Leiva-Merikakis, \\"Cult, Culty, and Cultic,\\" The Foghorn, March 6, 1987 Also in 1987, the SII faced its greatest crisis to date when the university president fired Fr.

Under his watch the SII's faculty had to design a course in Asian philosophy to satisfy pressure from the university to incorporate non-western sources into the curriculum.Stanley Kurtz, \\"Save NEH, Save St. Ignatius: Battles in the war,\\" National Review Online (Feb. 12, 2001): \\"In fact, several years ago, SII added the Koran, the Analects of Confucius, and the Hindu Ramayana to its great books curriculum.\\" A renewed clash was brought on by the transfer of the SII's chaplain, C.M. Buckley, away from San Francisco.George Neumayr, \\"Faithful Jesuit Told to Leave USF,\\" San Francisco Faith, 1998 Buckley, a published historian and translator with decades of university teaching experience, assigned as chaplain for a Catholic hospital in Duarte, California, where Fessio would be assigned by his Jesuit provincial superior some years later. Amidst these controversies, some SII faculty members and alumni expressed in print that their experience at USF had been enriched by their participation in the SII's intellectual community.Michael Torre, “A Fellowship Founded on Truth: The History of the Saint Ignatius Institute,” in Truth Matters: Essays in Honor of Jacques Maritain (Catholic U.

Bennett and Michael Novak of the American Enterprise Institute, in a full-page ad published in the San Francisco Chronicle and elsewhere. In a memo published nationally, Privett responded to criticism of his decision, stating that the replacement of the SII's leadership would promote \\"synergies between St. Ignatius Institute and other university programs\\" and create \\"efficiencies by consolidating resources.\\"\\"University president responds to critics\\", National Catholic Reporter (February 23, 2001) He held a conference with students to assure them that the SII would continue as a Great Books curriculum with qualified instructors.\\"President Meets with Ignatius Institute Students,\\" USF News, 10:6 (Feb. 21, 2001) Within the Catholic Church, the controversy reached Pope John Paul II through a letter of support for the SII signed by Fessio's former PhD thesis advisor Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith who became Pope Benedict XVI) and by Cardinal Christoph Schonborn (archbishop of Vienna and editor of the Catechism of the Catholic Church). Reportedly the letter was personally approved by the pope.Philip F.

Offspring The ousting of Director John Galten and his faculty at the SII spawned offspring institutions. Galten, with the assistance of Fessio and his Ignatius Press, launched Campion College of San Francisco in 2002, located just off the USF campus. Friends and alumni of SII also organized a sister college, Campion College of Washington, DC, but it never began operations.; cf. Monika K. Hellwig, \\"President's Letter,\\", Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities Update, 32:2 (2004): \\"Campion College of San Francisco is beginning a similar east coast two-year liberal arts college, Campion College of Washington, DC. This is a 64-credit tightly integrated program in western intellectual history.\\" Campion was a two-year Great Books program that effectively transplanted the SII reading list and curriculum,Stanley Kurtz, \\"Firing Fessio: The fight for Campion College is now the fight for the soul of higher education in America\\", National Review Online (Mar. 13, 2002): \\"Yet Campion College and its curriculum are virtually identical to the curriculum of the...St. Ignatius Institute.\\" under Galten's watch, to a new junior college granting Associate of Arts degrees to its graduates.J. Smith, \\"Campion College celebrates inaugural graduation\\", Catholic San Francisco (May 28, 2004) Campion operated for two years, graduating fourteen students, before financial constraints forced its closure. Fessio's participation in the founding of Campion College was viewed by USF authorities and by the Society of Jesus as a direct challenge. Consequently, Fessio's superiors ordered him to have no contact with the new school, and they transferred Fessio to the same Duarte, Calif., hospital where Buckley was chaplain.Christopher Zehnder, \\"Fessio Exiled: Jesuits Shun Invitation to Support New College\\" , San Francisco Faith, 2002 Fessio later resurfaced as founding chancellor and, later, provost of Ave Maria University, a new Catholic university launched in Naples, Florida, by the mercurial billionaire Thomas S. Monaghan, founder of the Domino's Pizza chain.

The American Sable rabbit breed can trace its roots to colored throwbacks from purebred Chinchilla rabbits belonging to Otto Brock of San Gabriel, California, in 1924.http://albc- usa.org/cpl/americansable.html Appearance The American Sable is a result of Chinchilla rabbit crosses. Sables are identical to Chinchilla rabbits in body conformation, but their coats are colored differently. The head, feet, ears, back, and top of the tail are a dark sepia, while the coat fades to a lighter tan over the rest of the body, similar to the coloring of a Siamese cat. The breed's eyes are usually dark with a ruby hue. Typically their weight can reach 7-15 lbs. Demeanor The American Sable enjoys the company of other rabbits. It is generally docile, spending most of the day sleeping. Typically they enjoy the companionship of their owner, but on their own terms. When distressed, the American Sable will make a grunting noise or will, like many other breeds, thump its back foot on the ground in an attempt to scare whatever it is that is bothering them.

A resource experiencing ongoing contention can be described as oversubscribed. Resolving resource contention problems is one of the basic functions of operating systems. Various low-level mechanisms can be used to aid this, including locks, semaphores, mutexes and queues. The other techniques that can be applied by the operating systems include intelligent scheduling, application mapping decision, and page coloring. Access to resources is also sometimes regulated by queuing; in the case of computing time on a CPU the controlling algorithm of the task queue is called a scheduler. Failure to properly resolve resource contention problems may result in a number of problems, including deadlock, livelock, and thrashing. Resource contention results when multiple processes attempt to use the same shared resource. Access to memory areas is often controlled by semaphores, which allows a pathological situation called a deadlock, when different threads or processes try to allocate resources already allocated by each other. A deadlock usually leads to a program becoming partially or completely unresponsive. In recent years, research on the contention is more focused on the resources in the memory hierarchy, e.g., last-level caches, front-side bus, memory socket connection.

Likir Monastery, Ladakh, India In Buddhism, sentient beings are beings with consciousness, sentience, or in some contexts life itself.Getz, Daniel A. (2004). \\"Sentient beings\\"; cited in Buswell, Robert E. (2004). Encyclopedia of Buddhism. Volume 2. New York, USA: Macmillan Reference USA. (Volume 2): pp.760 Sentient beings are composed of the five aggregates, or skandhas: matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness. In the Samyutta Nikaya, the Buddha is recorded as saying that \\"just as the word 'chariot' exists on the basis of the aggregation of parts, even so the concept of 'being' exists when the five aggregates are available.\\"David Kalupahana, Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism. The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 78. While distinctions in usage and potential subdivisions or classes of sentient beings vary from one school, teacher, or thinker to another, it principally refers to beings in contrast with buddhahood. That is, sentient beings are characteristically not enlightened, and are thus confined to the death, rebirth, and dukkha (suffering) characteristic of saṃsāra.Kimura, Kiyotaka (1991). The Self in Medieval Japanese Buddhism: Focusing on Dogen; cited in Philosophy East and West; Volume 41, Number 3, July 1991. University of Hawaii Press: pp.327–340. Accessed 22 October 2008. However, Mahayana Buddhism simultaneously teaches that sentient beings also contain Buddha-nature—the intrinsic potential to transcend the conditions of saṃsāra and attain enlightenment, thereby obtaining Buddhahood. In Mahayana Buddhism, it is to sentient beings that the Bodhisattva vow of compassion is pledged. Furthermore, and particularly in Tibetan Buddhism and Japanese Buddhism, all beings (including plant life and even inanimate objects or entities considered \\"spiritual\\" or \\"metaphysical\\" by conventional Western thought) are or may be considered sentient beings.Keiji, Nishitani (ed.)(1976). The Eastern Buddhist. 9.2: p.72. Kyoto: Eastern Buddhist Society; cited in Dumoulin, Henrich (author); Heisig, James (translator); and Knitter, Paul (translator)(2005). Zen Buddhism: A History ~ Volume 2: Japan. With an Introduction by Victor Sogen Hori. Bloomington, Indiana, USA: World Wisdom, Inc. Definition Getz (2004: p. 760) provides a generalist Western Buddhist encyclopedic definition: > Sentient beings is a term used to designate the totality of living, > conscious beings that constitute the object and audience of Buddhist > teaching. Translating various Sanskrit terms (jantu, bahu jana, jagat, > sattva), sentient beings conventionally refers to the mass of living things > subject to illusion, suffering, and rebirth (Saṃsāra). Less frequently, > sentient beings as a class broadly encompasses all beings possessing > consciousness, including Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Classification Early scriptures in the Pāli Canon and the conventions of the Tibetan Bhavacakra classify sentient beings into five categories—divinities, humans, animals, tormented spirits, and denizens of hell—although sometimes the classification adds another category of beings called asuras between divinities and humans.

They can take in water, and will keep doing so until they are full, or until the rate at which they can transmit water into and through the pores is exceeded. Some of this water will steadily drain through the soil (via gravity) and end up in the waterways and streams, but much of it will be retained, despite the influence of gravity. Much of this retained water can be used by plants and other organisms, thus contributing to land productivity and soil health. Soil water retention capacity Pores (the spaces that exist between soil particles) provide for the passage and/or retention of gasses and moisture within the soil profile. The soil's ability to retain water is strongly related to particle size; water molecules hold more tightly to the fine particles of a clay soil than to coarser particles of a sandy soil, so clays generally retain more water.Leeper, G.W. & Uren, N.C., 1993. Soil Science: An Introduction, 5th edn. Melbourne University Press, Melbourne. Conversely, sands provide easier passage or transmission of water through the profile. Clay type, organic content, and soil structure also influence soil water retention.Charman, P.E.V. & Murphy, B.W., 1998. Soils: Their Properties and Management, 5th edn. Oxford University Press, Melbourne. The maximum amount of water that a given soil can retain is called field capacity, whereas a soil so dry that plants cannot liberate the remaining moisture from the soil particles is said to be at wilting point. Available water is that which the plants can utilize from the soil within the range between field capacity and wilting point. Roughly speaking for agriculture (top layer soil), soil is 25% water, 25% air, 45% mineral, 5% other; water varies widely from about 1% to 90% due to several retention and drainage properties of a given soil. The role of soil water retention is profound; its effects are far reaching and relationships are invariably complex. This section focuses on a few key roles and recognizes that it is beyond the scope of this discussion to encompass all roles that can be found in the literature. The process by which soil absorbs water and water drains downwards is called percolation. Soil water retention and organism Soil water retention is essential to life. It provides an ongoing supply of water to plants between periods of replenishment (infiltration), so as to allow their continued growth and survival. For example, over much of temperate Victoria, Australia, this effect is seasonal and even inter-annual; the retained soil water that has accumulated in preceding wet winters permits survival of most perennial plants over typically dry summers when monthly evaporation exceeds rainfall. Soils generally contain more nutrients, moisture, and humus. Soil water retention and climate Soil moisture has an effect on the thermal properties of a soil profile, including conductance and heat capacity.Oke, T.R., 1987. Boundary Layer Climates, 2nd edn. Methuen & Co. in association with Methuen, Inc. New York. The association of soil moisture and soil thermal properties has a significant effect on temperature- related biological triggers, including seed germination, flowering, and faunal activity. (more water causes soil to more slowly gain or lose temperature given equal heating; water has roughly double the Heat capacity of soil) Recent climate modelling by Timbal et al. (2002)Timbal, B., Power, S., Colman, R., Viviand, J., & Lirola, S., 2002. \\"Does Soil Moisture Influence Climate Variability and Predictability over Australia?\\" Journal of Climate, Volume 15, pp.1230 – 1238. Viewed May 2007. suggests a strong linkage between soil moisture and the persistence and variability of surface temperature and precipitation; further, that soil moisture is a significant consideration for the accuracy of \\"inter-annular\\" predications regarding the Australian climate. Soil water retention, water balance, and other influences The role of soil in retaining water is significant in terms of the hydrological cycle; including the relative ability of soil to hold moisture and changes in soil moisture over time: *Soil water that is not retained or used by plants may continue downward through the profile and contribute to the water table (the permanently saturated zone at the base of the profile); this is termed \\"recharge\\". Soil that is at field capacity (among other reasons) may preclude infiltration so to increase overland flow. Both effects are associated with ground and surface water supplies, erosion, and salinity. *Soil water can affect the structural integrity or coherence of a soil; saturated soils can become unstable and result in structural failure and mass movement. Soil water, its changes over time and management are of interest to geo-technicians and soil conservationists with an interest in maintaining soil stability.

Careers Research & Advisory Centre. http://www.crac.org.uk NBS's chairman was Peter Baldwin, deputy director of radio at the IBA, and one of the three governors appointed by them. The need for a unified training scheme for ILR stations was established the previous year in a report by the Radio Consultative Committee.Radio Consultative Committee (RCC) General, 1980. RCC Paper 14 (80) National Broadcasting School. IBA/00267. March 1980. https://www1.bournemouth.ac.uk/discover/library/using-library/special- collections/broadcasting-history-collections The school was an aspirational project favored by Capital Radio managing director John Whitney, who shortly afterwards became director general of the IBA.Tony Stoller, Sounds of Your Life, 2010 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OblPAQAAIAAJ The IBA's National Broadcasting School operated in London from 1980 to 1985. After a break of 18 years, a National Broadcasting School was established in 2003 in Brighton by former staff member Rory McLeod. In 2015 a National Broadcasting School operates in Liverpool and is associated with the long-established ILR station Radio City, continuing in a similar tradition to the NBS of the 1980s. Background In the early 1980s professional radio training was provided almost exclusively by the BBC. Those independent stations who did train their staff, particularly journalists, found they moved quickly to ITV or the BBC. Music presenters came up through the UK's network of hospital radio and student radio stations,Edward Fennell, and Kenneth Gosling. \\"Horizons.\\" Times [London, England] 15 March 1984: 29. The Times Digital Archive. Retrieved 15 October 2015 or from the very few other opportunities available, such as the corporately run United Biscuits Network, UBN, and some larger ILR stations managed to attract talent from pirate radio. However, ILR stations had specific obligations in order to hold their licences. They were independent stations, not commercial stations, required to produce local output, including strong local news, information and features, plus a wider range of music than a commercial station would be prepared to sustain. They required a particular style of presenter, far less staid than BBC local radio, but still in touch with a local audience rather than having a full-on commercial approach. Smaller stations in particular had to grow their own talent, unable to rely on well-known names from the BBC or pirate radio joining them. NBS was seen as a way of attracting new talent to the independent broadcasting sector and providing professional training relevant to the new and more flexible working practices and modern equipment being introduced into ILR. The six broadcast- capable studios and newsroom were new and well-equipped in comparison to the general standards in BBC local radio at that time, having the latest decks and cartridge machines. Students could use professional-quality Marantz cassette recorders for news gathering rather than the unwieldy reel-to-reel Uher machines used by the BBC. The IBA reported in 1981 that NBS had \\"quite impressive studios and facilities in Greek Street.\\"IBA Paper 253 (81) 1 October 1981 Funding came from a controversial levy by the IBA on the profits of ILR stations, called \\"secondary rental\\", which created a pool of money for the common use of the industry. In 1980 secondary rentals from ILR had been swollen by a strike at ITV which meant advertisers and audiences turned to radio, and part of this windfall was used to finance the setting up of the school. Establishment and staffing The school was housed in the former St James's & Soho Club at 14 Greek Street, Soho. As a working men's club in 19th century London it had been a focus for radical activity \\\\- perhaps a fitting heritage for the ex-pirate radio staff who began to frequent it in the early 1980s. Less fitting perhaps, the Times reported that NBS was housed in what was once a \\"thriving Victorian brothel.\\"\\"A school for presenters.\\" Times [London, England] 15 Mar. 1984: 29.

Retrieved 15 October 2015 It was described by former trainee Fiona Phillips as \\"right in the centre of London's partially cleaned-up redlight district.\\"Fiona Phillips, Before I Forget, 2010, p.171 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AG8XZ5FSfj4C The burgeoning Comedy Store above a strip club a few streets away became a magnet for those who saw Kenny Everett as a more suitable role model than Lord Reith. 14 Greek Street, Soho, home of the National Broadcasting School from 1980 to 1985 (photographed in 2015). The main studio was at street level behind the centre and right-hand-side windows. Upper floors housed a newsroom and production offices. NBS's principal was the broadcaster Michael Bukht, later one of the founders of Classic FM, who was best known for his appearances on the BBC show Food and Drink in his persona as Michael Barry the Crafty Cook, a title he first used on London's Capital Radio in the 1970s. One of the first handouts given to new trainees was an extensive list of nearby Soho restaurants, each with a price guide and a capsule review prepared by the principal. Bukht had worked in Jamaica, where he reinvigorated commercial radio, and had recently returned from Transkei, one of the \\"independent\\" republics set up by the government of South Africa during apartheid, where he established Capital Radio 604. This privately run station, free of state control and providing uncensored music and news to South Africa, was firmly in the pirate radio tradition. Michael Bukht was programme controller of Capital Radio when John Whitney asked if he would launch NBS to support the expansion of ILR, then growing at the rate of five to eight stations a year. While the need for new staff was growing, the number lost to television each year was also growing. NBS's director of programmes was the influential former pirate radio DJ Dave Dennis (real name Neil Spence), who in the 1960s was among the first to introduce a high-pressure American style of music radio presentation to the UK while working at the pirate station Radio London, where he worked alongside the maverick DJ and presenter Kenny Everett. At Capital Radio, Bukht was now the programme controller charged with harnessing Everett's talent. Spence had left Radio London in 1966 and had since developed a reputation as a talent spotter.Media in Education and Development, 1981, Volume 14, Issue 4, p.159 https://books.google.com/books?id=AbpWAAAAMAAJ He had been a tutor at Earl Richmond's \\"London Broadcasting School\\" where one of his students was James Whale, In the 1970s he had been programme controller at UBN where he developed talents such as Graham Dene, and programme controller at ILR's Radio Trent where he employed ex-UBN presenter Dale Winton. NBS's central location in 1980s Soho and the presence of Neil Spence led many a former pirate radio DJ to pop in for a catch-up, along with others Spence had trained and mentored as programme director at UBN. NBS trainees often had the slightly strange sensation of vaguely recognizing the face of a visitor they passed on the stairs, but then hearing an instantly-recognizable voice. Head of news was Martin Campbell, an experienced journalist who after eight years in newspapers moved into commercial radio in 1975, and had been head of talks at BRMB in Birmingham, and head of features at Radio Trent in Nottingham, where among a comprehensive speech output he fronted daily phone-ins and music shows, and produced commercial radio's first situation comedy. In 1998 he would become director of programming and advertising at the Radio Authority and in 2004 the first head of radio at Ofcom. In his early career Campbell was said to have been inspired by Neil Spence's teachings on radio broadcasting. Among the journalism staff was Rory McLeod, who began his career at the ILR station Radio Clyde in Glasgow and in 1983, Rory alongside Keith Belcher, helped establish Southern Sound .Keith Belcher stayed on as Managing Director. In 2003 after a break of 18 years Rory would be the director of a new \\"National Broadcasting School\\" near Brighton. The school had a department of community education headed by Keith Yeomans, a BBC radio producer and later an adviser to the UK government's department of international development. Julie Hill, who had worked in training for the BBC and ITV as well as for the British Council overseas,Media in Education and Development, 1981, Volume 14, Issue 4, p.159-60 https://books.google.com/books?id=AbpWAAAAMAAJ was course director for NBS's Development Support Communication Course which was run for students from less-developed countries.Media in Education and Development, 1984, vols 17-18, p.152 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fbtWAAAAMAAJ Courses Journalism courses were recognised by the National Union of Journalists, the NUJ, and accredited by the Joint Advisory Committee for the Training of Radio Journalists, JACTRJ, now the Broadcast Journalism Training Council, BJTC. Journalism trainees needed to be aged 18 or over, and at the beginning did not need to be graduates, although by 1984 most were. Standards were rigorous. Trainees in presentation and production were selected by audition tape. Unlike the journalism courses, anyone could apply regardless of their qualifications, and Spence and his staff were deluged with audio cassettes which had to be whittled down ruthlessly to find candidates with potential. Most trainees funded the substantial course fee and their living expenses themselves, and the 13-week courses were so intensive that working a part-time job to make ends meet was impossible. Industry sponsorship for trainees was extremely scarce, and taking the course required giving up any regular work they already had. Spence's critique of a presenter's performance was always formidable, and his influence extended far beyond NBS.Dale Winton, My Story, 2012, p.146-47 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6n7XkAZC7-sC As a fledgling DJ Peter Young worked for Spence at UBN and benefited from his training and mentoring. By the time Spence was at NBS, Young was an experienced and accomplished presenter with a late night show on Capital Radio. \\"One night he phoned me on air to tell me off for something he considered to be out of order,\\" said Young. \\"I had to laugh, but was very flattered that he considered it to be worth his while.\\" Turning out presenters for ILR meant teaching them to work creatively within a format and to develop an authentic on-air personality which was bright but accessible for a broad local audience. The tone was very different from pirate days, and Spence abhorred reminders of his pirate radio past. When one trainee presenter used a Dave Dennis catchphrase back to him during a critique, he asked her where she had heard it. When told it was from Dave Cash, who had worked with him at Radio London and was then programme director at the ILR station Radio West (now Heart Bristol), Spence was uncompromising: \\"If you listen to him you’ll end up working in Gibraltar with monkeys for an audience.\\"Dave Cash, 2012, He Sounds Much Taller - Part 1, Chapter 2 https://play.spotify.com/album/2vIDbwlKVDW4xx5W4p5SDh Cash's feelings were hurt, but Spence had a point. Radio West struggled to find an audience until its music and presenters became more mainstream. Presenters' end-of-course assessments were graded one to five. A five meant basic proficiency and competence, while a grade one denoted a student of outstanding talent and distinction. The course materials noted that a grade one was \\"very rarely awarded,\\" but in practice Spence was never known to award a grade one, nor for that matter a grade two. A grade three was considered a high accolade - denoting \\"a student of merit - diligent, talented and able.\\" At most, 20% reached this grade.NBS Proficiency Certificate Gradings, 1980-1985 The school also ran intensive courses for broadcast engineers who wanted to work in ILR. It trained businessmen and politicians in media skills. It ran short courses for charities to learn how to get their information on air. It sent trainers out to ILR stations so that working broadcasters could brush up and develop their skills. It ran high-level seminars for station managers. It sent consultants to new stations to advise on training. The school was recognized by the British Council, and provided training advisers to stations in Oman, Jamaica and the Solomon Islands.EEC Assistance to Third World Media, January 1986 http://aei.pitt.edu/12767/1/12767.pdf Many trainees came from the Commonwealth. The intensive radio journalism and presentation courses continued throughout. A television journalism course was set up in 1983 after NBS was approached by the editorial director of ITN, Mike Morris, who was concerned at the high drop out rate among ITN's small number of graduate trainees. In one two-year period, four out of six trainees had left, frustrated by what Morris's successor, Derek Taylor, labelled \\"sink-or-swim\\" training.The Lens, staff newspaper for ITN, issue 16, Oct/Nov 1985 p.5 http://itn1955club.co.uk/TheLens/lens16.pdf NBS then provided structured television training in same mould as its radio training. NBS courses were intensive with good reason. Nick Stuart, later to be an award-winning independent television producer and CEO of CTVC and Odyssey Networks, graduated in the top three of his radio journalism course to win a coveted industry placement at 2CR. Reflecting in 2014 he said: \\"I think the first two weeks at Two Counties was just a shock. Wow, it's this intense.\\" He quickly moved to a 5am shift at another station to compile traffic and travel reports, where his first bulletin prompted the newsreader to hit him around the head for not providing completely clean copy: \\"Maybe it was just a style of management that was big in those days, that's all. Very aggressive.\\" Alumni NBS provided its courses to a large number of future broadcasters, some of whom became household names. They included the GMTV journalist and presenter Fiona Phillips, who wrote: Phillips' subsequent experience was typical - she was asked to work for free. But nearly all trainees accepted that the early months working in ILR would involve long hours and little if any pay, at least until they had proved that NBS had given them the practical skills valued by the industry. Among other alumni, BBC Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine took a presentation and production course aged 17 before going to university, Chris Skudder of Sky Sports studied journalism, and so did Lisa Aziz, who became one of the first Asian presenters on British television. Zeinab Badawi, who by the end of the 1980s was presenting Channel 4 News with Jon Snow, was one of the few trainees to have industry sponsorship: \\"In those days there wasn’t any kind of media course or anything like that. I was trained on the job, but ITV sent me to something called the National Broadcasting School, which doesn’t exist anymore, which was in Soho, and I did a three-month intensive training course there and that was it.\\" Others who trained at NBS included the broadcaster and academic Tim McLellan, Virgin Radio presenter Russ Williams, and the LBC talk show host Clive Bull. Martine Dennis subsequently worked at LBC and the BBC before joining Al Jazeera English. Among the many musicians who trained in presentation and production was the reggae artist Mikey Dread, who had produced The Clash's iconic single Bankrobber and worked on their album Sandinista!. From NBS he went on to narrate the Channel 4 reggae documentary Deep Roots Music and host the television series Rockers Roadshow. Martha Kearney graduated from NBS at the start of a career in which she rose from phone operator and news information researcher at LBC to a BAFTA nomination for her coverage of the Northern Ireland Peace Process in 1998 and presenting the BBC's flagship The World at One Chris Shaw became programme controller of Channel 5 and editorial director of ITN Productions. Michael Wakelin was BBC head of religion and ethics, and won Royal Television Society, Sony and other industry awards. Jonathan Pearce was a freelance football reporter in the early 1980s, then sports editor of Radio West, and in 2004 began to commentate on Match of the Day. Andrew Jones trained at NBS before becoming the first person in BBC Scotland to graduate from the BBC's MBA programme and became head of BBC Scotland. John Leech won a clutch of Gold Medals at the New York Festival for his soul and dance shows, and a UK Sony Award for music documentary. Nick Hirst also won gold at the New York Festival and was responsible for running all British Foreign Office radio and print communications in more than 130 countries. Hugh Terry went to Radio Television HK as a presenter while also pursuing an acting career including the Radio 4 adaptation of Bleak House, which won a Sony radio award. Gavin Ford features in the Pirate Radio Hall of Fame for his work at Radio Caroline and has presented for Lebanon's Radio One for 16 years. Tony Leo returned from NBS to Radio St Helena where he developed the station using voluntary producers in the community, retiring after 29 years service. Electronics engineer Bob James arrived at NBS from hospital radio and working as a club DJ, and after 20 years in commercial radio as presenter and engineer started broadcasting at Bay Radio in Spain. Debbie Flint worked at Piccadilly Radio as a broadcasting assistant before reporting and presenting for them, and later establishing a career as a children's presenter. Among the international students who studied radio presentation and production was the Nigerian writer and broadcaster Agwu NwogoAgwu Nwogo, Destined to Be, 1985, p.66 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZGLRAAAAMAAJ who for many years worked for the Imo Broadcasting Service, IBS. Colin Burrows became a producer at Capital Radio and BBC Radio 1 before launching Sky's film programme and acting as a specialist consultant on film marketing. After NBS, Robert Gallacher began in the BBC's gramophone library and rose to be commissioning editor for BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6 Music, and has won three Radio Academy awards and five PROMAX awards. After NBS Sean Bolger joined Southern Sound as a presenter and after a spell at ILR station Radio 210 joined BFBS in Cyprus. The documentarist Mark Halliley, best known for narrating UK series of The Apprentice, in his early years after leaving NBS produced a string of award-winning radio features, picking up New York Festival gold medals, Sony awards, a Prix Futura Berlin, and producing two ILR entries for the Prix Italia award. Closure When it was set up, NBS was projected to be self-financing by the financial year 1983–84. The IBA was initially prepared to absorb some of the projected losses, with Capital Radio making substantial contributions, outweighing other ILR stations. But by 1983 NBS board members had to be given indemnities that they were \\"acting properly on behalf of the Authority,\\" and by June 1984 the annual grant was no longer enough.Tony Stoller, Sounds of Your Life, 2010 p.134 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OblPAQAAIAAJ By 1984, seven ILR companies had reached the level of profitability required to pay the bitterly resented \\"secondary rental.\\"IBA Annual Report and Accounts 1984, p.94 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fs1aAAAAYAAJ Their trade body, the Association of Independent Radio Contractors, issued a strong protest to the IBA, in particular warning that they would not bear the costs of any proposed national independent radio station. The IBA responded tactically by reducing secondary rental by 10 per cent from July 1985, but the position for NBS was clear. For Tony Stoller, a former chief executive of the Radio Authority, this was a pivotal moment when independent local radio, with its clear obligations to local communities, was set on course to become commercial radio.Tony Stoller, Sounds of Your Life, 2010 p.135 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OblPAQAAIAAJ The school announced its closure on 11 July 1985, stating that the level of financial support available from the industry was insufficient to allow the school to continue training after the end of the existing courses that August. According to one of its television tutors, the ITN journalist Jon Lander: Announcing the closure, NBS chairman Peter Baldwin said that many broadcasters already looked back with \\"pride and affection\\" to their days at the school. The statement added: \\"During its five years of operation, the NBS, under its principal, Michael Bukht, has achieved an outstanding reputation for practical vocational training in broadcast programming, journalism and engineering.\\"National Broadcasting School, Press release, 11 July 1985 Legacy Michael Bukht claimed that more than 3,000 broadcasters trained at the school between 1980 and 1985, but of this figure, only 500 or so took the flagship intensive 13 week courses in radio (and later television) journalism, and music radio presentation and production. Bukht was proud that at one point half of all the programme controllers in the UK had been trained at the National Broadcasting School, by a training staff which never numbered more than a handful. But pirate radio \\"anoraks\\" were also quick to note in 1985 that many of those who had trained at NBS in the previous five years were broadcasting on the current crop of pirate stations.Anorak UK Weekly Report, no.64, 21 July 1985, p.1 http://www.dxarchive.com/pdf/auk/auk_issues_062-065_july_1985.pdf The impact of NBS's training at ITN was profound. Three months after NBS closed, editorial manager Derek Taylor, recalling his own \\"miserable\\" experience as a trainee in the 1960s, announced the development of new in-house training in the same mould as that of NBS. Although NBS had closed, he told staff: \\"At ITN, we were determined there would be no return to the Dark Ages.\\" Former ITN staff reporter Sue Lloyd-Roberts had just a month's notice to organize a structured twelve-week training programme in TV journalism. As Taylor said: \\"After all, if we believe we're the best in the world at what we do, there ought to be just a few tricks we could pass on.\\" Many former NBS staff and students remained actively involved in training new generations. NBS head of news Martin Campbell became principal lecturer at Cornwall's post-graduate diploma in broadcast journalism, former trainee Andrew Jones launched an undergraduate degree in journalism at Robert Gordon University, and many others passed on the lessons and the ethos formally or informally in the following decades. Bukht told former BRMB programme controller Mike Owen that NBS was \\"a wonderful organization,\\" comparing it favorably to the subsequent rapid development of media studies degree courses. \\"The school was interested in theory only so far as it impinged on the practice, and that was a very different approach. There were no essays at the National Broadcasting School.\\" While the school's approach was very different from academic media studies, it was similar in ethos and approach to the long-established skills-based newspaper journalism courses and indenture system run by the National Council for the Training of Journalists. But even NCTJ courses required essays. At NBS the focus was more intense, more practical, faster-paced, and for large parts of the curriculum, live. As far as possible it reflected radio as a medium. Newspaper reporters had news editors and sub-editors to catch their mistakes before they became public. Live radio had no such luxury, and for presenters especially, any mistakes, lapses of taste, or errors of judgement went out on air. An environment which closely simulated real working conditions was essential for effective skills-based training. With intensity came competition. Celebrating 20 years at Virgin Radio in 2013, a record for a commercial radio presenter, Williams recalled how he and Jeremy Vine had started the same NBS music presentation and production course exactly thirty years before, in 1983: \\"I came out with the Student of the Course award,\\" he said. \\"I like to remind Jeremy of that from time to time.\\" But trainees were imbued with Bukht's considered approach to broadcasting, with the emphasis on finding a broad audience: \\"If you don't want to talk to the multitude, get off the mountain,\\" he told his trainees. \\"Fundamentally, good radio is listener radio not broadcaster radio. I say to people good radio starts with the audience, it doesn't start with what you want to do.\\" The Guardian's classical critic and author Fiona Maddocks recalled: \\"His aim was to make first-class independent radio broadcasters of his students, of whom I was one: no airs, graces, circumlocution or elocution. His mythical listener was called Doris. \\"You've got to catch Doris hanging out her washing – and make her listen,\\" was his mantra as we each headed to the microphone.\\" Interviewed in an era when local radio stations were amalgamating and digital and internet radio were making inroads, Bukht reinforced the message he gave his students in the 1980s: \\"It doesn't matter what the technology does, in the end it's a human being in the box that makes the difference.\\" Successors In 2003 former NBS staffer Rory McLeod became director of a new incarnation of the National Broadcasting School in Brighton. The new NBS was located in the Innovation Centre of the University of Sussex, and Red FM (Red Radio) was the school's own radio station. In 2007 it was running two practical 11-week courses - a radio news course for post-graduates, and a radio presentation and production course for which no formal qualifications were necessary other than \\"creativity and an ability to connect to the listener.\\"Fay Schopen. \\"How Do I Become….\\" Times [London, England] 28 June 2007: 4[S1]. The Times Digital Archive. Retrieved 15 October 2015 Students created daily air shifts and news bulletins five days a week, using the equipment they would encounter in the workplace. Head of presentation and programming was Ray Arthur, ex-KROQ and a consultant to Virgin Radio. In 2009 the school was described as having two centres, one in Brighton and the other in Liverpool at Radio City. It described its approach to training as \\"short, intensive, practical and demanding. Classes are small and the student to instructor ratio is never more than 7:1. Emphasis is on voice, creativity, fluency, performance plus core skills such as software and law.\\" In 2015 the National Broadcasting School / Radio City Academy in Liverpool under course director Liam Fogarty continues the tradition of training journalists for commercial and BBC radio stations, providing courses accredited by the Broadcast Journalism Training Council.Accessed 10 October 2015 According to UK Press Gazette: \\"The course is based at the professional studios of Radio City in Liverpool, the UK’s most successful commercial radio station. The NBS has its own \\"Newsroom\\" and full- time access to its own training studio. Students also have access to the main broadcast studios when available. Each student has a professional portable recording kit and a work station, a network news provider, the internet, news software, programming software, Adobe Audition, and phone out interview facilities. Students will also broadcast on NBS Live during the course.\\" The NBS official Twitter account states: \\"We like to think we produce the best radio graduates in the country: the future of radio, if you like.\\" Bibliography * Radio Consultative Committee (RCC) General, 1980.

He was a major force in developing Pebble Beach and Carmel Woods. Ford established the Carmel Valley Airport and a nearby business district. He created the Carmel Realty Company; was a cartoonist, poloist, baseball player, coach in the Carmel Abalone League, and acted in and directed over 45 plays. Ford was a major part of the social circle and society leader in the Monterey Peninsula. His ancestry dates back to the French Huguenots. Early life Byington Ford was born on November 1, 1890 in Downieville, Sierra County, California to Tirey L. Ford and Mary Emma Byington. His family moved to San Francisco in 1895. He experienced the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire when he was fifteen years old. Ford graduated from Santa Clara College in 1910 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. At Santa Clara College, he acted in the Nazareth The Passion Play and was elected president of the debating team. He went on to get his masters from the University of California at Berkeley, graduating in 1913, where he earned his degree of Master of Arts.University of California Register, Berkeley, 1912-13, University of California Press Berkeley, 1913. The thesis for his master's degree was A History Of The County Court Of England From 1066-1307. Ford studied law at St. Ignatius Jesuit College, now the University of San Francisco, but gave up the idea of practicing law and instead went into the real estate. On November 17, 1920, Ford married Marion Boisot in Pebble Beach. In 1922, he built their home on 17-Mile Drive in Pebble Beach. He and his wife Marion had three children, Mary Jane, Patricia, and Audrey Ford. On February 19, 1925. On Feb 23, 1937, Ford married his second wife, Ruth Austin Arlen in Reno, Nevada.The Monterey County Herald, December 6, 2009, Page 4 Animated Film Corporation In 1916, Ford was Director of the Animated Film Corporation in San Francisco, of which his father, Tirey L. Ford, was president.The endeavor ended with the entry of the U.S. into World War I. Military In 1917, Ford enlisted in the California National Guard and went to Officers Training Camp at the Presidio of San Francisco where he was commissioned and then sent to France during World War I. He was Captain in the 26th \\"Yankee\\" Division. In France, he trained at the Saint-Cyr cavalry school.World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918 He was in the engagements of Château- Thierry, Saint-Mihiel and the Toul sector. On March 10, 1919, Ford returned home after recuperating from a poison gas attack suffered during an advance in Troyon, France. Ford saw active service practically the whole time he was in France. He brought a detachment of soldiers to New York from France.San Francisco Chronicle; \\"Captain Byington Ford, Son of Tirey L. Ford, Among Men to Arrive\\" In 1941, Ford enlisted in the Air force during World War II and became a Lieutenant colonel (United States). Politics While living in Carmel, Ford got involved in local politics. On August 25, 1934, speakers of the Carmel citizens' committee directly accused the John Reed Clubs of being a communistic organization. Ford chairman of the committee, read reports from the national committees and showed charts seized in recently raided communist headquarters. Ford headed the citizens' committee to oppose the JRC and their activities. Real estate In 1919, working with Samuel Finley Brown Morse, Ford became manager at the Del Monte Properties in Pebble Beach, California, heading their real estate department for twelve years. He rode horseback through the undeveloped parts of Del Monte Forest to survey the land for development. In 1931 he formed the Carmel Realty Company. Carmel Valley Airport Ford developed the first airpark in Carmel Valley. According to the Carmel Valley Historic Airport Society, \\"Convinced that mass production of small aircraft would put a plane within the reach of anyone who could afford a car, in the late 1930s Byington bought the northeast corner of Rancho Los Laureles for an airpark. He and his brother Tirey Ford developed the Carmel Valley Airport for pilot-owners who would want to be at home a minute or two after getting out of their plane. A nearby road was named after him called Ford Road.Carmel Valley Air Park, Carmel Magazine, 2014 Ford constructed the first two \\"hangar homes\\" when he opened the air park to the public on December 7, 1941. His timing that proved unfortunate as this was the same day Pearl Harbor was bombed.\\"Living at Runway's Edge, LA Times, 2001. In 1954, Ford retired and Peter Delfino purchased the Carmel Valley airport property for $35,000.The Californian (Salinas, California), February 15, 1954, Page 9 In 1946, Byington and his brother, Tirey Ford, Jr., developed the Carmel Valley Village and Airway Market, first known as the General Store, a barber shop, a drug store and soda fountain, a beauty shop, and a liquor store. All were in walking distance of the Airpark. Artist Bruce Ariss painted murals on each store to resemble a Spanish village.Monterey County California Regional GuideMonterey Country The Dramatic Story of Its Past, Augusta Fink Later life In 1955, he wrote a sketch book called \\"A Cartoon Sketch Book for Beginners\\" Death On January 19, 1985, at age 94, Ford died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Ventura, California.California Death Index and Social Security Death Index.

Conference 1: Law, Games, and Virtual Worlds (November 13-15, 2003) This interdisciplinary conference was the first effort to understand the phenomenon of digital games and the virtual worlds they create, creating a discussion about the complex social, psychological, and legal issues to which they give rise.New York Law School: State of Play I Linked 2014-08-04 Conference 2: Reloaded (October 28-30, 2004) The second conference highlighted two themes: the role of intellectual property and governance in virtual worlds. Should we import copyright and trademark into virtual spaces? Can we exclude them? What should be the relationship between real and virtual world economies? Should legislatures protect virtual world property? What are the possibilities for using virtual spaces to practice the activities of real world democracy? Should virtual worlds be treated as separate jurisdictions with their own evolving norms and forms of dispute resolution? What is the potential for using virtual worlds to promote democracy and self-governance?New York Law School: State of Play II Linked 2014-08-04 Conference 3: Social Revolutions (October 6-8, 2005) The third conference focused on social relationships in the metaverse and how to build vibrant, flourishing, creative places.New York Law School: State of Play III Linked 2014-08-04 Conference 4: The Terra Nova Symposium (December 1-2, 2006) The fourth conference was an intentionally smaller event intended to engage in the serious study of virtual worlds by getting researchers to inquire into the nature of research into these worlds. The conference gathered researchers, scholars and thinkers together to ask how virtual worlds should be studied, as well as what are the most fruitful lines of research, the most interesting substantive developments, and the most fascinating voices from whom we should be hearing? This conference was capped at 60 participants and was put on in conjunction with Terra Nova, the blog about the serious study of virtual worlds.New York Law School: State of Play IV Linked 2014-08-04 Conference 5: Building the Global Metaverse (August 19-August 22, 2007) While the previous conferences had been held at New York Law School, this event was held in Singapore and was organised jointly by Harvard Law School, Yale Law School, New York Law School, Trinity University, and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The conference discussed the future of cyberspace and the impact of these new immersive, social online environments on education, law, politics and society.

He was part of the Dundee team who won the Scottish Cup in 1910, having earlier played for Dumbarton, Motherwell, Notts County, Newcastle United, St Mirren and Southampton. He also represented both Scotland and the Scottish League XI. In addition, while with Dumbarton he earned a representative cap for Dumbartonshire against Glasgow in 1897, and played for both sides in the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots trial matches. He later went on to coach Dundee and Chelsea. Career Jack Fraser started his football career at the late age of 18 with his local club Dumbarton, where he appeared as part of the team that lost the Scottish Cup final 5–1 to Rangers in 1897. After then spending one season with Motherwell he decided to try his luck in England and joined First Division club Notts County in January 1898. He remained at County for eighteen months before moving on to Newcastle United where he remained for two seasons, until returning to Scotland with St Mirren for the 1901–02 season. Fraser represented the Scottish League XI in 1902. By the time he joined Southampton in May 1902 he had clocked up eight years with five different clubs with no conspicuous success. He was signed by Southampton as a replacement for Edgar Chadwick who had moved on to Liverpool after leading the Saints to the 1902 FA Cup final. In an effort to reclaim the Southern League title, Southampton recruited six new players, including fellow Scots, Tom Robertson from Liverpool and Mark Bell from Heart of Midlothian. Fraser scored a hat-trick on his debut against Brentford on 6 September 1902 (with the other goals from fellow débutante Tom Barlow (2) and Harry Wood) and soon became a fixture in the side and missed only a handful of games in the 1902–03 season, including twice giving way to C. B. Fry for his final appearances for the club. On 13 December 1902 he scored four goals as Saints recorded their joint highest victory margin of 11–0 against Watford. When he joined the Saints he originally played at centre-forward, but he soon switched to inside-left where he had his best games and soon became a crowd favourite. Described in Holley & Chalk's \\"The Alphabet of the Saints\\" as \\"a bulky man\\" he \\"found the wing positions more to his liking and presented an awesome sight to defending goalkeepers when cutting inside and bearing down on them in full flight\\". Saints finished Fraser's first season by taking the Southern League championship for the fifth time in seven years with Fraser contributing 15 goals. This success was repeated in the following season, although in February 1903 he lost his place through injury to Fred Mouncher. He was restored to the starting line-up for the 1904–05 season where he continued to dovetail well on the left with George Hedley, but Saints finished the season in a disappointing third place. Fraser had planned on remaining in Southampton as his intention was to purchase a tobacconist's business in the town, but the deal fell through and he then accepted excellent terms from Dundee and returned to Scotland. The return to Scotland paid dividends as he was to gain an international cap for Scotland on 16 March 1907 in a 1–0 victory over Ireland. He went on to win the Scottish Cup in 1910, defeating Clyde 2–1 in a second replay. Fraser moved back to England in 1919 to work for Chelsea, firstly as a scout. He was later an assistant manager under David Calderhead and Leslie Knighton.

Accessed September 26, 2007. (after College Park Airport). The Works Progress Administration built the terminal building between 1935 and 1936. The building was remodeled and expanded in 2006-2008 but still retains much of its original integrity. During World War II the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces as a training base. At the end of the war the airfield was returned over to the City of San Antonio for civil use. As the reliever for San Antonio International, the airport has an FBO, three flight schools, police and state aviation units, a part 135 operator, two aerial photography outfits, helicopter tour company and helicopter flight school, and numerous general aviation aircraft. It is also home to the Texas Air Museum. The historic terminal was renovated in 2006-2008 and runway 9-27 re-opened on March 11, 2010 after being re-surfaced and extended to 5002 feet, allowing more private and business jet traffic. In August 2010 The Texas Wing of the Civil Air Patrol announced it will be moving its statewide headquarters to Stinson Municipal Airport. It was only in Stinson for several years before moving to its current location.  Facilities The airport covers 360 acres (146 ha) at an elevation of 577 feet (176 m). It has two asphalt runways: 9/27 is 5,000 by 100 feet (1,524 x 30 m) and 14/32 is 4,128 by 100 feet (1,258 x 30 m).

Most critics who enjoy the show credit it for being \\"spooky\\". In a typical comment, one reviewer said the show was \\"...the perfect blend of bump-in-the-night scariness and cinéma vérité. It's 'The Blair Witch Project' meets 'Unsolved Mysteries.' But if you scare easily, don't watch this show alone.\\"Toby, Mekeisha Madden. \\"'Paranormal': It's a Real Ghostbusters.\\" Detroit News. December 10, 2007. Reviewers have pointed out that the show effectively utilizes a number of cinematic techniques common in horror film. The editing leaves open the question of whether paranormal activity is actually occurring, and the cinematography uses night-vision and infrared photography to create a suspenseful atmosphere. The writing on the show is particularly effective at creating a sense of portent and dread, one reviewer noted, and the music and graphics contribute effectively to the tension and fear as well. At least one critic has pointed out that the investigatory team's failure to find paranormal activity in each episode gives the show credibility over other series about the paranormal lack.Owen, Rob. \\"Penn State's Double Dose of National Media Exposure.\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

December 14, 2007. As one otherwise positive review noted, \\"The biggest drawback to the series is that it's over-produced, with too many eerie sounds and visual effects. Is the heavy breathing something picked up by PRS microphones, or is it a sound effect added after the fact by the show's producers?\\" Critics have also pointed out that the show lacks visual punch. People interviewed in the show declare that they \\"feel\\" a spirit next to them, but nothing is shown to the TV viewer. In the series debut, the audience is told that a young boy sees ghosts, but the audience is not able to see any evidence of this.Peterson, Karla. \\"The Difference Between Fright and Wrong.\\" San Diego Union-Tribune. December 10, 2007. \\"The most compelling footage seems to come more from the editing room than beyond the grave\\", noted one industry trade publication. Reviewers say the show also fails to effectively integrate and utilize the team's (apparently) sophisticated audio and video equipment to heighten tension or help support their claims of paranormal activity. Others have noted that the show's stars are not particularly good performers or presenters. Buell and the changing cast of supporting \\"paranormal trainees\\", psychologists, counselors and psychics seem inexperienced and are ineffectual at creating a sense of fear or suspense. \\"Buell looks self-conscious and sounds like he is reading from cue cards\\", one critic wrote. \\"The remaining three members of the core team ... don't seem confident or mature enough to take on a crabby Starbucks' manager, much less a demonic presence.\\" Release=Marketing In November 2007, a six-story billboard was erected at the corner of Prince and Mulberry Streets in New York City. Behind the billboard were two directional audio (or audioSpotlights) which produce a highly focused beam of sound. Passers-by who walked directly in the path of the sound would hear spooky, disembodied voices whispering suggestive messages such as \\"What's that?\\" and \\"Who's there? It's not your imagination.\\" But someone standing next to that person would hear nothing. The billboard had a dramatic effect on people coming within range of the \\"cone of sound\\" created by the directional audio speakers.

It is one of Virginia's eleven recognized Native American tribes. It is not federally recognized. It achieved state recognition in February 2010.Danielle Moretti- Langholtz, Ph.D., A Study of Virginia Indians and Jamestown: The First Century, \\"Chapter 2: Research Design\\", National Park Service, 2006, accessed 16 Mar 2010 In the 17th century, at the time of early English colonization, the Patawomeck tribe was a \\"fringe\\" component of the Powhatan Confederacy. At times it was allied with others in the confederacy, and at others, the Patawomeck allied with the English colonists. Today the tribe has about 2,300 members. Eighty percent live within ten miles (16 km) of their historic village of Patawomeck. They are trying to revive their historic Algonquian language. History For thousands of years various cultures of indigenous peoples succeeded each other, living along the Potomac River and its tributaries in the coastal area. Archeological excavations have yielded much data about the prehistoric early cultures. At Indian Point on Potomac Creek, for instance, part of the later Patawomeck area, archeological excavations in the 1930s revealed a Native American burial ground (Potomac Creek, 44ST2). Researchers donated 134 skeletons from the grounds to the Smithsonian Institution. Now that the Patawomeck tribe has been recognized by the state, they may undertake claiming the remains for repatriation and burial under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), though a tribe has to be federally recognized to utilize NAGPRA without extra petitioning.Linda Wheeler, \\"Modern Lives Dwell in the Indian Past\\" , The Washington Post, 20 Oct 2002, accessed 16 Mar 2010National NAGPRA Frequently Asked Questions, National NAGPRA, accessed 16 March 2010 More recently, a 1996 archeological study by the College of William and Mary revealed Native American artifacts dating back to the 15th century. More than 10,000 artifacts were recovered, mostly pottery sherds of the \\"wrapped-cord type\\" common among local indigenous people. While the ancient village site is protected under historic preservation laws, the land is being steadily eroded by the creek. The coastal peoples were part of the Algonquian-speaking language family that coalesced into differentiated tribes from present-day New England into the southern states. The historical Patawomeck tribe formed as one of 32 Algonquian-speaking peoples in the Tidewater area of present-day Virginia. They were loosely allied with the powerful Powhatan Confederacy. They were an agricultural people, cultivating varieties of maize. They also relied on hunting, fishing and gathering resources from their rich environment. 17th century The first recorded European encounter was that of the English leader Captain John Smith, who visited the people in 1608 in their homeland, between Aquia Creek and Upper Machodoc Creek. He noted they were cultivating of corn along the Potomac River. The Patawomeck main town, also called Patawomeck, was located on the north of Potomac Creek, in present-day Stafford County. The weroance of Passapatanzy, a satellite village, was Japazeus (also spelled Japazaws or Iopassus), older brother to the main weroance. The Patawomeck were semi-independent of the Powhatan Confederacy of Chief Powhatan to the south. They befriended the English colonists (Captain Samuel Argall in particular), often providing them crucial assistance when the Powhatan would not. When the colonists faced starvation at Jamestown in 1609, Francis West was sent to buy corn from the Patawomeck. In a violent confrontation, he beheaded two of them and fled in his pinnace to England. Argall made peace with the Patawomeck in 1612, during the First Anglo-Powhatan War. According to contemporary accounts by Ralph Hamor and others, on 13 April 1613, Argall, with the connivance of Japazaw in exchange for a copper kettle, was able to capture Chief Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas who lived with the Patawomeck tribe for three years. Argall was on a goods trading mission for her father. Current Mattaponi tradition holds that she was the wife of Kocoum, brother of the Patawomeck weroance Japazaws, and that Argall's soldiers killed Kocoum after her capture in 1613. Today's Patawomecks believe that Pocahontas and Kocoum had a daughter, Ka-Okee, who lived with the Patawomecks after her father's death and her mother's abduction. However, other scholars have noted that the only mention of a \\"Kocoum\\" in any English document is taken from a statement published in 1616 by William Strachey in England, noting that Pocahontas had been living married to a \\"private captain called Kocoum\\" for three years. Since 1614 is certainly when she married John Rolfe, and no other contemporary records even hint at any previous husband, it has accordingly been suggested that when Strachey wrote of the \\"private captaine called Kocoum\\" he was mistakenly referring to Rolfe himself, with the reference being later misunderstood as one of Powhatan's officers. In addition, the date of Strachey's original statement has been widely disputed by numerous authors attempting either to make the case, or refute, that Pocahontas had been previously married. The Patawomeck continued to ally with the English in their conflicts with the Powhatan in 1622 (even after Captain Isaac Madison took their weroance prisoner), and in 1644. After settlers began moving into their area in the 1650s, pressures mounted in competition over resources and differing ideas of how to use land. Violent disputes followed. In 1662, Colonel Giles Brent took their weroance Wahanganoche prisoner, but the colonists ordered him released. In October 1665, the weroance sold their remaining land to the colony for a few matchcoats.Fairfax Harrison, 1924, Landmarks of Old Prince William, pp. 39-40. In 1666 after continued conflicts, the English colonists declared war against several tribes in the Northern Neck, including the Patawomeck. After this, the Patawomeck disappeared from the historical record. A silver badge, issued to Wahanganoche in 1662, was found in a contemporary archeological excavation near Portobago (or Portobacco) on the Rappahannock River. It may indicate that the survivors merged with the Portobacco tribe, as did remnants of several other tribes.Helen C. Rountree, Pocahontas's People, p. 122. 20th century to present In 1928, the anthropologist Frank Speck wrote of the Native American population living around the original Patawomeck capital. From his studies of the Algonquian peoples, he believed they were remnants of the old Patawomeck nation. Although without solid proof they were not from another tribe, he called them the \\"Potomac\\".Rountree, p. 216 Many families living in and around White Oak in Stafford County had oral histories linking them to the Patawomecks; these included families with the names Sullivan, Newton, Green, Bourne, Bullock, Fines, and Curtis. However, racism in Virginia caused many families to hide their Indian ancestry. In particular, Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924 and the work of state Bureau of Vital Statistics registrar Walter Plecker ensured that for most of the 20th century, official records recognized Virginians as either \\"white\\" or \\"colored\\", erasing Indian heritage from the public record. In the 1990s, Robert \\"Two Eagles\\" Green, a native of White Oak and resident of Fredericksburg, worked to reorganize the tribe and began seeking state recognition. The tribe applied to the Virginia Council on Indians for recognition, and were told that they met five of the six criteria for recognition; however, the council felt that the Patawomecks were not able to prove that their group had continued to exist as a distinct Indian community through the years. The alleged Patawomecks felt that they had sufficient evidence to prove their continuous existence as a community, and persuaded Bill Howell, Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates and representative for Stafford, to sponsor a bill for the tribe's recognition. In February 2010, Las Vegas singer Wayne Newton, whose father was Patawomeck (also of Irish descent), spoke before the House Rules Committee in support of recognition. In the same month, the measure was passed unanimously by the House of Delegates and the state Senate, marking official state recognition of the tribe. The same measure granted the Patawomecks a seat on the Virginia Council on Indians. Robert \\"Two Eagles\\" Green was the chief of the tribe from its reorganization until 2013, when he retired and became Chief Emeritus. Green was an adviser to the filmmakers of The New World (2005), about the colony at Jamestown and the Native American peoples and cultures encountered by the colonists. Green appeared in the film in a non-speaking role; his son Jason Green also appeared as a Powhatan warrior. The Patawomecks provided the filmmakers with numerous wild turkey feathers and deer antlers to create authentic clothing for the Native American characters in the film. Green also portrayed Powhatan in the episode \\"Pocahontas Revealed\\" (2007) of PBS's Nova. In 2013, Green was succeeded as chief by John Lightner. Today the tribe has approximately 2,300 members, most of whom live in Stafford County within ten miles of Patawomeck. In 2014, the tribe worked with Stafford High School to make the school's \\"Indian\\" mascot more representative of Virginia Indians. In 2019, John Lightner was succeeded by Charles Bullock as Chief. The tribe's language was of the Algonquian family. It is no longer spoken, but some tribal members are working to revitalize the language. They hold classes using the audio and printed materials prepared by the linguist Blair Rudes for cast members who portrayed Native Americans in the film, The New World. Rudes reconstructed the Algonquian language as it was spoken in coastal Virginia in the early 17th century.

Early life Chauncy was born Nancen Beryl Masterman in Northwood, Middlesex (now in London), and emigrated to Tasmania, Australia, with her family in 1912, when her engineer father was offered a job with the Hobart City Council. She attended St Michael's Collegiate School in Hobart. In 1914, the family moved to the rural community of Bagdad, where they grew apple trees. The bush setting of Bagdad, including a bushranger's cave, would inspire some of her future writing, and also a lifelong involvement with the Australian Girl Guides movement. Initially organising Guide meetings and camps at her brother's Bagdad property, Chauncy started her own Guide troop in Claremont where she worked as a women's welfare officer at the Cadbury's Chocolate Factory from 1925.Berenice Eastman, 'Chauncy, Nancen Beryl (Nan) (1900–1970)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, Melbourne University Press, 1993, pp 408–409.

She also studied and practiced writing, while living on a houseboat on the River Thames. In 1934, she travelled to Sweden, Finland and the Soviet Union, and taught winter classes in English language at a Girl Guide school in Denmark. While returning by ship to Australia in 1938, she met a German refugee named Helmut Anton Rosenfeld, and the couple married at Lara, Victoria, on 13 September. They lived in Bagdad and changed their surname to Chauncy, the name of Nan's maternal grandmother, to avoid anti-German sentiment during World War II.

Chalker.  Plot summary  A viral species named the Dreel, originating from outside the Milky Way galaxy, invades human territory. The central human government, known as the Com, attempts to fight back, but finds that their resources are inadequate to repel the invaders. In desperation, the records of the work of Gilgram Zinder (who had discovered the superimposed Markovian reality and built the sentient supercomputer Obie to manipulate it) are unsealed and his work is reproduced. Lacking the time to develop the technology fully, the Com builds ships called Zinder Nullifiers, which simply erase the contents of the space that they are pointed at. When they make the final stand against the Dreel invasion fleet, the Nullifiers are switched on and left on, obliterating the Dreel fleet. However, something unexpected then occurs, as the void in space begins to grow, erasing everything in its path from existence. At this point, Mavra Chang and Obie are reintroduced. It has been over 700 years since Obie faked his destruction and ran away with Mavra, and they are currently in another galaxy trying to positively influence the development of an intelligent civilization. Obie senses the malfunction in the Well World when the anomaly forms and begins to expand. He travels to the Well World, determines that it is broken and requires repair. He determines that the only person able to effect such repair is Nathan Brazil, but notes that the Well should have summoned Brazil to fix the malfunction. Obie recalls that Brazil was suffering from memory loss the last time he journeyed to the Well World; worried that this may have recurred, he and Mavra set out to locate Brazil. Once back in the Milky Way, Mavra and Obie have a problem: Brazil doesn't want to be found. The amazonian superwomen that Ben Yulin forced Obie to create, known as Olympians, founded a religious cult based on the godhood of Nathan Brazil. Their population has expanded to fill an entire planet, with the women serving as emissaries for the cult. In the face of their dogged pursuit, Brazil has gone underground. Undeterred, Mavra and Obie join forces with a mysterious human named Gypsy and his miniature dragon companion (and Com agent) Marquoz to recruit a group of Olympians to try to track down Brazil. In the process, Mavra is quite surprised to find that one of the \\"founding mothers\\" of the religion, Gilgam Zinder's daughter Nikki, is still \\"alive\\" as a computer personality. Convinced that Obie remained in the control of Yulin, and that Mavra had perished seven centuries earlier, Nikki believes that Mavra's approach is a trick, and she sets out to double-cross Mavra and Obie. Eventually, the investigators are able to track Brazil to a freighter operating in the space of the centaur-like Rhone (Dillians on the Well World). Despite the attempted interference of the Olympians, the party is able to meet with Brazil and discuss the situation with him. They find that he is very much in command of his faculties, and had not travelled to fix the Well because he didn't want to. Brazil informs them that in order to fix the malfunction, it would be necessary to temporarily shut down the Well of Souls, which would bring the Universe to the same end as if the rift in space were allowed to expand indefinitely. Although there would be a chance that the Well would short out beyond repair in the next few millennia, Brazil is willing to take the chance to give the races well beyond the reach of the rift the opportunity to achieve greatness. Obie disagrees with this assessment. By his calculation, Brazil is underestimating the odds of failure, and overestimating how much longer the Well can persist. Obie argues that the Universe will end regardless, but if Brazil acts now, he will be able to restart it afterwards, and use the Well to reseed it with intelligent life. Obie proposes to use his own immense capabilities to reprogram the entire planet full of Olympians to travel to the Well World, acting as both as foot soldiers in the inevitable fight against Brazil's return to the Well World, and also as the massive seed population needed when the Universe is restarted. Although Brazil remains reluctant, he is ultimately enfolded within Obie and forced to see the machine's logic. Brazil finally agrees to go along with the plan, but on one condition: he will go into the Well of Souls and perform the necessary repairs, but only on the orders of another person, so that the responsibility for the billions of lives ended is not his alone. With the plan thus laid out, the inner circle of Chang, Gypsy, Marquoz, and an Olympian head priestess named Yua travel to the Well World to put it into effect. Brazil indicates that he will follow sometime later, as he does not expect to receive a warm welcome. Although Obie is no longer able to help the party, he does impart them with a hint to the Well to influence the species that they are transformed into. Upon arrival at the Well World, the party arrives at the South Zone, where they are met by Serge Ortega. Ortega is a former human, transformed by the Well into a Ulik, a six-armed being that is half man, half snake. Although his species has a relatively short lifetime, Ortega has taken advantage of Well \\"magic\\" to obtain an unlimited lifespan, but this \\"spell\\" lasts only as long as he remains in the Zone. Mavra risks telling Ortega about the crisis in the Well of Souls and the impending arrival of the Olympians and Nathan Brazil. Ortega was present the last time Brazil went into the Well of Souls, and he believes that Brazil was not God, as Brazil claimed, but a megalomaniac who might do real damage if he were allowed to re-enter the Well. As the novel closes, Mavra, Marquoz, and Yua have arrived at their new hexes and are beginning to find their bearings. Marquoz is in Hakazit, a high-tech, volcanic land of massive armored lizards (though not firebreathers, to his disappointment). Yua is in Awbri, a nontechnological land of arboreal mammals in which the society is dominated by males. Mavra is in Dillia, semitechnological land of the centaurs. Gypsy resurfaces in an ocean hex, curiously untransformed. As the first waves of Olympians begin to pass through zone, an alarm sounds, and Serge Ortega is summoned to find that his guards have killed Nathan Brazil.

He is notable as the paid \\"stand-in\\" for President Abraham Lincoln. Biography Staples was born in 1845 in Stroud Township in rural Monroe County, Pennsylvania. During the Civil War, he enlisted in late 1862 as a private in Company C of the 176th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regimemt, but only served a few months due to illness, likely typhoid fever. Following his medical discharge, he moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked with his father as a carpenter. In late 1864, he was approached by a representative of the president. During the Civil War, it became customary for many citizens to pay for \\"substitutes\\" to serve in the army in their place. Hoping to set a good example, President Lincoln selected Staples as his \\"representative recruit\\" and offered him a bounty of $500.

He was closely associated with Noel Pemberton Billing and Lord Alfred Douglas. Early life Born in 1890, Spencer was a native of the American state of Wisconsin, but his family were British. He studied at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, where he was known for his active cultural interests. Shortly after leaving he married a countess who was \\"nearly twice his age\\", but the relationship was short lived. After a \\"stormy encounter in a New York hotel\\", the couple separated.The Ottawa Journal, Ottawa, Canada, 3 June 1918, p.13. He subsequently travelled widely with the rank of midshipman, and worked occasionally as a war correspondent. He volunteered to serve in the British army during World War I. He was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery in 1915, rising to the rank of Captain. He served on three fronts and became involved with the British Secret Service.Toni Bentley, Sisters of Salome, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, NE., 2005, p.76. However, his increasing obsession with the idea that the Germans were conspiring to sexually corrupt British civilians led to his being invalided out of the army in 1917 on grounds of mental instability, diagnosed with \\"paranoid delusional insanity\\".Philip Hoare, Oscar Wilde's Last Stand: Decadence, Conspiracy, and the Most Outrageous Trial of the Century, (New York: Arcade Pub., 1998), , p.57 Writings=Homophobic activity He was soon writing for the journal Imperialist, founded by Noel Pemberton Billing. In 1918 he convinced Billing to publish an article which claimed that 47,000 Britons were being blackmailed by Germans to \\"propagate evils which all decent men thought had perished in Sodom and Lesbia\\". It was said that names were listed in the \\"Berlin Black Book\\" of the \\"Mbret of Albania\\". A second article, attacking the actress Maud Allan for her alleged association with the conspiracy, led to a sensational libel case, at which Spencer stood as a witness for Billing. Spencer lied in court,Hoare, p.118 claiming to have obtained evidence of German and Austrian plans to blackmail British citizens while working for an Austrian aristocrat in Albania before the war. Billing won the case. Antisemitic activity In addition to its attacks on alleged homosexuals, the Imperialist regularly suggested that leading members of the British establishment were Jewish and that \\"the ruling and representing of Britain has become a close tribal affair\\".Hoare, p. 59This could have been a quote by Noel Pemberton Billing as here: http://spartacus-educational.com/BUbeaverbrook.htm Spencer published Democracy or Shylocracy (1918), an antisemitic tract which claimed to be \\"A Brief for Men and Women Who Labour and Who Sacrifice to Make the World Safe for Democracy, Only to Find Themselves Enslaved by Capitalism and Their Earnings Controlled by Monopolists\\".London: C. F. Roworth, 1918: Singerman 0089 The book argued that Jewish leaders had coordinated the Russian revolution and other recent events in world history. Spencer argued that Jews were an innately nomadic people \\"baked by the sun in the dry burning climate of the great deserts of North Africa, Arabia and Asia Minor...The desert crept into their hearts, and so at all times they were filled with the spirit of the sandy wastes\\".Stone, Dan, Breeding Superman: Nietzsche, Race and Eugenics in Edwardian and Interwar Britain, Liverpool University Press, 2002, p.45 The book was published in several editions, later being issued by an organisation called The Britons with the added subtitle \\"shall the Jew win?\\". The 1922 third edition included a preface written by John Henry Clarke, author of England Under the Heel of the Jew. Libel cases In 1920 Spencer became closely associated with Lord Alfred Douglas, who was increasingly obsessed by antisemitic conspiracy theories and who had also testified in the Billing trial. Douglas and Spencer worked together on the journal Plain English in which their theories were published. Spencer and Douglas circulated the claim that Lord Kitchener had been murdered by Jews to prolong the war and that Jewish businessman Ernest Cassel had conspired with Winston Churchill to circulate false information about the Battle of Jutland in order to make money by stock speculations. Douglas and Spencer fell out when Douglas discovered that Spencer had been lying about some of his claims. On 16 October 1921, Douglas resigned as editor, and Spencer took over. Douglas wrote, \\"When I left the paper, I was very angry. I thought I had been badly treated, and Captain Spencer and I had a violent quarrel.\\" In 1922 Spencer attacked the painter Sigismund Goetze in an article in Plain English. Goetze had recently completed a series of paintings depicting the history of the British Empire. Spencer called him \\"a foreign Jew\\" who was \\"an alien in Common Law and a perpetual enemy of this Christian empire\\". Though of partial German-Jewish descent, Goetze was born in London and was a Christian. He sued Spencer for libel. Spencer was convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment.William D. Rubinstein, The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011, p.330. Spencer was deprived of his army rank as a result of his conviction. Shortly afterwards, Douglas published a pamphlet called The Murder of Lord Kitchener and the Truth about the Battle of Jutland and the Jews, in which he repeated his earlier accusations against Churchill. Churchill, who had previously opted to ignore Douglas and Spencer, was provoked into action. Douglas was arrested and charged with libel in November 1923. At the trial Spencer's lies were brought into evidence, contributing to Douglas's own conviction. He too was sentenced to six months. Shortly after Spencer's release he was re-arrested. He was convicted and fined for what was described as \\"disgusting behaviour\\".Kettle, Michael, Salome's Last Veil: The Libel Case of the Century (1977) He subsequently disappeared from public life and died in The Bahamas from Parkinson's disease in August 1957 at the age of 67.Ancestry: Harold Sherwood 'Howland' Spencer  References External links * Category:1890 births Category:1957 deaths Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:British political writers Category:British social commentators Category:LGBT rights in the United Kingdom Category:People from Wisconsin Category:Royal Artillery officers ","title":"Harold Sherwood Spencer"},{"id":"13441297","text":"Annie Buller addressing a crowd before the Estevan Riot The Estevan riot, also known as the Black Tuesday Riot, was a confrontation between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and striking coal miners from nearby Bienfait, Saskatchewan which took place in Estevan, Saskatchewan on September 29, 1931. The miners had been on strike since September 7, 1931 hoping to improve their wages and working conditions.  Background  The region's mining work was seasonal; during the rest of the year, between April and August, miners would work in the fields to supplement wages before they returned to the mines. However, the droughts in the prairies and the overall economic situation in Canada made that impossible. That led to an increasing number of men looking for work in the mines, which let mining companies to choose their workers. Furthermore, according to the Royal Commission that investigated the strike, Saskatchewan miners made half as much as their counterparts in Alberta and in British Columbia. Most of the miners and their families lived within company housing. Annie Barylik, the sixteen-year-old daughter of a miner at Bienfait Mine,s described the conditions: > One bedroom, two beds in there, dining room, no beds in there, kitchen, one > bed, and eleven in the family.... I think we need a bigger place than that. > When it is raining the rain comes in the kitchen. There is only one ply of > paper, cardboard paper nailed to about two-inch wood board.... It is all > coming down and cracked... When the weather is frosty, when you wake up in > the morning you cannot walk on the floor because it is all full of snow, > right around the room.[null] Wylie Commission, Proceedings, vol. 3, pp. > 77-78. The miners were represented at the bargaining table by the local of the Mine Workers' Union of Canada (MWUC), which had been organized by the Communist Party of Canada's trade union umbrella, the Workers' Unity League.  Riot  Miners assembled in Estevan with their families to parade through the city to draw attention to their strike. The RCMP confronted them and attempted to block and break up the procession. Police violence broke out, and the RCMP opened fire on the strikers and killed three people. Many other strikers were wounded and arrested. Annie Buller, working with the Workers' Unity League, spoke in Estevan in support of the striking workers. After the riot, Buller was charged and sentenced to one year of hard labour, to be completed at the Battleford Jail, and a $500 fine.  Resolution  After a meeting with Royal Commission Counsel, members of both parties signed the following agreement: > We, the mine operators and employees in conference at the court-house > Estevan, this sixth day of October, 1931, hereby agree that the mines be > opened immediately and the men return to work on following conditions, viz.: > (1) That this be considered a temporary arrangement pending the findings of > the Wylie Royal Commission and the possible drafting of a working agreement > between the operators and the men. > (2) That committees of employees for each mine be a recognized organization > in each mine. > (3) That the provisions of the Mines Act be observed in relation to check- > weighers. > (4) That all water in the roadways and working face be removed by the > company and that such places be kept as dry as possible. > (5) That the terms of any schedule or agreement finally reached between the > operators and the men be made retroactive to the date of re-commencement of > work by them. > (6) That there shall be no victimization or discrimination against men on > account of the strike, particularly in reference to men on the payrolls as > at September 7 last. > (7) That contract men be employed on an eight-hour basis, face to face, and > the company men work nine hours a day. > (8) That because of working conditions in the various mines. the removal of > slack and questions of overweight be left to negotiations between the > operators and the committees of employees.\\"Preliminary Agreement,\\" p. 9.  Legacy  The event is still controversial in Estevan. The three striking miners killed have the inscription \\"murdered by RCMP\\" on their headstone, and locals still alternately erase and restore those words. The Saskatchewan Federation of Labour has created a plaque to memorialize the strikers.  Popular culture  The riot was depicted in the controversial movie Prairie Giant: the Tommy Douglas Story in which Tommy Douglas is falsely portrayed to be present. Also, James Garfield Gardiner was portrayed as being premier of Saskatchewan at the time although it was really James Thomas Milton Anderson. The riot was depicted by James Keeleghan in the title track of the Small Rebellions album in 1990.

Students also come from adjacent areas of the towns of Newburgh, Crawford, Wallkill, Hamptonburgh, and New Windsor. A small portion of Ulster County's Town of Shawangunk also sends students to this district. There is also another school named Valley Central Public School in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. It operates six schools: Berea Elementary SchoolEast Coldenham Elementary SchoolMontgomery Elementary School Montgomery Elementary School is located on Union Street (NY 211) in the village of Montgomery, New York, United States. It educates children from grades kindergarten through 5, most of them residents of the village or nearby sections of the Town of Montgomery. It is a Colonial Revival-style brick building dating to the 1920s. When it was built it was the school for all ages in the village, but became an elementary school when the district was created in the late 1950s. In 2008 it was named a high-performing/gap closing school under the reporting requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. Fifth- graders go on to Valley Central Middle School. This school has 1 courtyard and a garden. It has 2 playgrounds 1 for grades K-2 and 1 for 3-5. Walden Elementary School Walden Elementary School educates children from kindergarten through fifth grade in the village of the same name, and adjacent areas of the surrounding Town of Montgomery. The building itself was opened in 1926 as the single school building for what was then the Walden School District, educating students of all grade levels from the village, a purpose still evident from the \\"Walden Grade-High School\\" entablature on the pediment above the four Corinthian order columns at the main entrance. When Valley Central was created from the merger of Walden and two neighboring districts in the late 1950s, it became just one of three (later five, now four) elementary schools in the district. The school was at the center of a small controversy in 2007. On November 15, an employee at the school received a bomb threat in email. School officials locked down the building, letting police enter and confining students to their rooms until an hour after their normal dismissal time. Parents who had objected to the school's decision, and its failure to notify them, kept a quarter of the students home the next day as a protest. School district officials defended their actions as required by the situation.

During the April-August 1832 Black Hawk War, between white settlers in the lead mining regions and Sauk Chief Black Hawk's British Band, Hamilton again served in the volunteer militia. Accounts of the war indicated that Hamilton was often in charge of the militia's indigenous allies. At the war's onset it was known that many of the Sioux and Menominee were eager to join the conflict against the Sauk. Hamilton was sent to the Michigan Territory, north of Prairie du Chien, to recruit the assistance of indigenous allies. The result was successful and several parties of U.S. aligned Native Americans joined the war.Smith, The History of Wisconsin: In Three Parts, Historical, Documentary, and Descriptive, p. 263. In June, Hamilton's return to Fort Hamilton with a large group of militia-aligned Native Americans coincided with the arrival of one of the survivors of the June 14 Spafford Farm massacre. The survivor, Francis Spencer, arrived at the fort around the same time as Hamilton did - accompanied by U.S. aligned Menominee. Afraid that the fort, like his party at the farm, had also been attacked, Spencer retreated back into the woods. He avoided the fort for between six and nine days, when hunger finally drove him into the open and he realized his mistake. Wakefield, John Allen; Stevens, Frank Everett, ed.

Though well known as a smelter and miner in the lead region of southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois, Hamilton was unable to achieve the political fame he desired. Mining career When Hamilton moved from Illinois to Wisconsin in the late 1820s he established a lead ore mine that became known as Hamilton's Diggings; he later renamed the settlement Wiota.

Smith, 221 U.S. 559 (1911), was a Supreme Court of the United States case that held that the newly created state of Oklahoma was permitted to move its capital city from Guthrie to Oklahoma City, notwithstanding the Enabling Act provision that prohibited it from being moved from Guthrie until after 1913. Background In 1907, Oklahoma was admitted as a U.S. state. The new state's capital was located in Guthrie. Section 497 of the Oklahoma Constitution stated that the terms of the U.S. Congress's enabling act of 1906—which allowed Oklahoma to create a state constitution and be admitted to the Union—were \\"accepted by ordinance irrevocable\\". Section 2 of the enabling act read: > The capital of said state shall temporarily be at the city of Guthrie ... > and shall not be changed therefrom previous to Anno Domini nineteen hundred > and thirteen; but said capital shall, after said year, be located by the > electors of said state at an election to be provided for by the legislature; > ... On December 29, 1910, the state of Oklahoma enacted a statute which removed the state capital from Guthrie to Oklahoma City. W.H. Coyle, owner of large property interests in Guthrie, sued the state of Oklahoma, arguing that the move was performed in violation of the state constitution's acceptance of the terms of Congress's enabling act. Holding The Supreme Court held that preventing the state of Oklahoma the right to locate its own seat of government deprived it of powers which all other states of the Union enjoyed, and thus violated the traditional constitutional principle that all new states be admitted \\"on an equal footing with the original states\\". As a result, the provision of the enabling act which temporarily restricted Oklahoma's right to determine where its seat of government would be was unconstitutional. As stated by Mr. Justice Lurton: > Has Oklahoma been admitted upon an equal footing with the original states? > If she has, she, by virtue of her jurisdictional sovereignty as such a > state, may determine for her own people the proper location of the local > seat of government. She is not equal in power to them if she cannot.At p. > 579. Quoting Chief Justice Chase's opinions regarding the indestructibility of the Union and the principle of federalism contained in Texas v. White and Lane County v. Oregon, the opinion concludes: > To this we may add that the constitutional equality of the States is > essential to the harmonious operation of the scheme upon which the Republic > was organized. When that equality disappears, we may remain a free people, > but the Union will not be the Union of the Constitution. \\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 221 NotesExternal links * Category:Legal history of Oklahoma Category:History of Oklahoma Category:History of Oklahoma City Category:Equal footing doctrine Category:1911 in United States case law Category:1911 in Oklahoma Category:Logan County, Oklahoma Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the White Court Category:Guthrie, Oklahoma Category:Former state capitals in the United States ","title":"Coyle v.

He succeeded Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1805-1861) as professor of zoology to the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Paris. Gratiolet is remembered for his work in neuroanatomy, physiognomy and physical anthropology. He did extensive research in the field of comparative anatomy, and performed important studies regarding the differences and similarities between human and various primate brains. He is also credited for introducing the demarcation of the brain's cortical surface into five lobes, (frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and insular cortex). With Paul Broca (1824-1880) he performed correlative studies of aphasia and the frontal lobe.

Gainesville: Scientific Publishers. The Oregon swallowtail was declared the state insect of Oregon in 1979 by the Legislative Assembly.Chapter 186 — State Emblems; State Boundary Oregon Revised Statutes Description The adult Oregon swallowtail has a yellow abdomen with black lines. It has a wingspan of to . Its wings have concave spots that are scalloped inwards with a reddish-orange eyespot along the lower border, similar to, but smaller than, the eyespot of the common Old World swallowtail. The yellow markings on the wings of the Oregon swallowtail are also brighter than the common swallowtail. It has a tail characteristic of all swallowtail butterflies. The caterpillar is black with yellow markings. It reproduces twice a year, and can be seen flying from April to September. The butterflies seen toward the beginning of the year are lighter in color than those seen later and blend well with the color of early plants. Range and habitat The range of the Oregon swallowtail is from southern British Columbia, eastern Washington and Oregon, to Idaho and western Montana, primarily in the lower sagebrush canyons of the Columbia River and many of its tributaries. In its caterpillar (larva) stage, it feeds on tarragon sagebrush. As an adult, it eats flower nectar, preferring thistles, balsamroot, and phlox. Chrysalids of this subspecies can overwinter. A recommended viewing spot is along the banks of the Columbia River at Vantage, Washington, where Interstate 90 crosses the river. U.S. Postal Service stamp On June 6, 1977, the United States Postal Service released sets of four 13-cent stamps illustrating American butterflies, including the Oregon swallowtail.

The school is an associate member of Round Square Organization, driven by the philosophy of Kurt Hahn. Initially an 'O' Level school, CGS introduced 'A' levels in 2004/2005. CIE results in 2006 were: 2% pass, (55% A/B) for 'A' Levels; 100% pass, (96% A/B) for 'O' Levels. CGS is also a centre for the US College board examinations, SAT I & SAT II. It is also one of only twelve schools Bangladesh to be listed in the ISS (International Student Services) Directory of excellent International schools. In 2003 CGS was awarded 'International Fellowship Centre' status by Cambridge International Examinations. History The Chittagong Grammar School (CGS) was founded in 1992, to satisfy the need for an international school in Chittagong. A derelict building on Sarson Road was renovated and refurbished to house the school which opened in January 1993. There were only five classes - 5 to 9, 64 students and 14 teachers. Enrollment commenced in October/November 1992 and classes began on 12 January 1993. The range of classes was expanded and by 1996 the entire range of classes (Playgroup to 'O' Levels) was being offered. Later the same year, the academic year of the school was changed from January - December to a September - June session. In September 1996, CGS relocated and moved the Junior Section (Playgroup- Class 3) to its new premises. In addition to Round Square, CGS is a member of several other international organizations, including a College Board Center (SAT tests), Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme (DOE), International School Services (ISS), Harvard University Model United Nations (MUN) and an international Fellowship Centre for Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). Curriculum CGS follows a British school curriculum, with the exception of the CGS NC campus, which follows the national curriculum. During the school year several field trips are conducted to complement the curriculum being taught in class.  Extracurricular activities  The school has an extracurricular programmes including: aerobics, arts and crafts, badminton, basketball, chess, community service, cricket, dance, debating, drama, elocution, embroidery, environmental conservation, excursions/expeditions, fitness training, general knowledge instrumental music, karate, literary magazine, newspaper, photography, soccer, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, track and field, vocal music, volleyball, yearbook, yoga.

Soil biodiversity relates to some catchment management considerations. Biodiversity According to the Australian Department of the Environment and Water Resources, biodiversity is \\"the variety of life: the different plants, animals and micro-organisms, their genes and the ecosystems of which they are a part.\\" Biodiversity and soil are strongly linked, because soil is the medium for a large variety of organisms, and interacts closely with the wider biosphere. Conversely, biological activity is a primary factor in the physical and chemical formation of soils.Bardgett, RD 2005, The biology of soil: a community and ecosystem approach, Oxford University Press Inc, New York. Soil provides a vital habitat, primarily for microbes (including bacteria and fungi), but also for microfauna (such as protozoa and nematodes), mesofauna (such as microarthropods and enchytraeids), and macrofauna (such as earthworms, termites, and millipedes). The primary role of soil biota is to recycle organic matter that is derived from the \\"above-ground plant-based food web\\". Soil is in close cooperation with the wider biosphere. The maintenance of fertile soil is \\"one of the most vital ecological services the living world performs\\", and the \\"mineral and organic contents of soil must be replenished constantly as plants consume soil elements and pass them up the food chain\\".Baskin, Y 1997, The work of nature, The Scientific Community on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE), Island Press, Washington, DC The correlation of soil and biodiversity can be observed spatially. For example, both natural and agricultural vegetation boundaries correspond closely to soil boundaries, even at continental and global scales.Young, A & Young R 2001, Soils in the Australian landscape, Oxford University Press, Melbourne. A \\"subtle synchrony\\" is how Baskin (1997) describes the relationship that exists between the soil and the diversity of life, above and below the ground. It is not surprising that soil management has a direct effect on biodiversity. This includes practices that influence soil volume, structure, biological, and chemical characteristics, and whether soil exhibits adverse effects such as reduced fertility, soil acidification, or salinisation. Process effects=Acidification Global variation in Soil acidity: Red = acidic soil. Yellow = neutral soil. Blue = alkaline soil. Black = no data. Soil acidity (or alkalinity) is the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the soil. Measured on the pH scale, soil acidity is an invisible condition that directly affects soil fertility and toxicity by determining which elements in the soil are available for absorption by plants. Increases in soil acidity are caused by removal of agricultural product from the paddock, leaching of nitrogen as nitrate below the root zone, inappropriate use of nitrogenous fertilizers, and buildup of organic matter.Slattery, B and Hollier, C (2002). Impacts of Acid Soils in Victoria, A report for Department of Natural Resources and Environment, Goulburn Broken Catchment Management Authority and North East Catchment Management Authority Many of the soils in the Australian state of Victoria are naturally acidic; however, about 30,000 square kilometres or 23% of Victoria's agricultural soils suffer reduced productivity due to increased acidity. Soil acidity has been seen to damage the roots of the plants. Plants in higher acidity have smaller, less durable roots. Some evidence has shown that the acidity damages the tips of the roots restricting further growth. The height of the plants has also seen a marked restriction when grown in acidic soils, as seen in American and Russian wheat populations. The number of seeds that are even able to germinate in acidic soil is much lower than the amount of seeds that can sprout in a more neutral pH soil. These limitations to the growth of plants can have a very negative effect on plant health, leading to a decrease in overall plant population. These effects occur regardless of the biome. A study in the Netherlands examined the correlation between soil pH and soil biodiversity in soils with pH below 5. A strong correlation was discovered, wherein the lower the pH the lower the biodiversity. The results were the same in grasslands as well as heathlands. Particularly concerning is the evidence showing that this acidification is directly linked to the decline in endangered species of plants, a trend recognized since 1950. Soil acidification reduces soil biodiversity. It reduces the numbers of most macrofauna, including, for example, earthworm numbers (important in maintaining structural quality of the topsoil for plant growth). Also affected is rhizobium survival and persistence. Decomposition and nitrogen fixation may be reduced, which affects the survival of native vegetation. Biodiversity may further decline as certain weeds proliferate under declining native vegetation.Hollier, C and Reid, M (2005). Acid Soils. DPI AgNote April 2005. In strongly acidic soils, the associated toxicity may lead to decreased plant cover, leaving the soil susceptible to erosion by water and wind. Extremely low pH soils may suffer from structural decline as a result of reduced microorganisms and organic matter; this brings a susceptibility to erosion under high rainfall events, drought, and agricultural disturbance. Some plants within the same species have shown resistance to the soil acidity their population grows in. Selectively breeding the stronger plants is a way for humans to guard against increasing soil acidity. Further success combatting soil acidity has been seen in soybean and corn populations suffering from aluminum toxicity. Soil nutrients were restored and acidity decreased when lime was added to the soil. The plant health was increased and root biomass increased in response to the treatment. This is a possible solution for other acidic soil plant populations Structure decline Soil structure is the arrangement of particles and associated pores in soils across the size range from nanometres to centimeters. Biological influences can be demonstrated in the formation and stabilization of the soil aggregates, but it is necessary to distinguish clearly between those forces or agencies that create aggregations of particles and those that stabilize or degrade such aggregations. What qualifies as good soil contains the following attributes: optimal soil strength and aggregate stability, which offer resistance to structural degradation (capping/crusting, slaking and erosion, for example); optimal bulk density, which aids root development and contributes to other soil physical parameters such as water and air movement within the soil; optimal water holding capacity and rate of water infiltration. Well-developed, healthy soils are complex systems in which physical soil structure is as important as chemical content. Soil pores—which are maximized in a well-structured soil—allow oxygen and moisture to infiltrate to depths and plant roots to penetrate to obtain moisture and nutrients.Aplin, G (1998). Australians and Their Environment: An Introduction to Environmental Studies. Oxford University Press, Melbourne. Biological activity helps in the maintenance of relatively open soil structure, as well as facilitating decomposition and the transportation and transformation of soil nutrients. Changing soil structure has been shown to lead to reduced accessibility by plants to necessary substances. It is now uncontested that microbial exudates have a dominant role in the aggregation of soil particles and the protection of carbon from further degradation. It has been suggested that microorganisms within the soil \\"engineer\\" a superior habitat and provide a more sound soil structure, leading to more productive soil systems. Traditional agricultural practices have generally caused declining soil structure. For example, cultivation causes the mechanical mixing of the soil, compacting and sheering of aggregates and filling of pore spaces - organic matter is also exposed to a greater rate of decay and oxidation. Soil structure is essential to soil health and fertility; soil structure decline has a direct effect on soil and surface food chain and biodiversity as a consequence. Continued crop cultivation eventually results in significant changes within the soil, such as its nutrient status, pH balance, organic matter content, and physical characteristics. While some of these changes can be beneficial to food and crop production, they can also be harmful towards other necessary systems. For example, studies have shown that tilling has had negative consequences towards soil organic matter (SOM), the organic component of soil composed of plant and animal decomposition and substances synthesized by soil organisms. SOM plays an integral role in the preservation of soil structure, but the constant tilling of crops has caused the SOM to shift and redistribute, causing soil structure to deteriorate and altering soil organism populations (such as with earthworms). Yet in many parts of the world, maximizing food production at all costs due to rampant poverty and the lack of food security tends to leave the long term ecological consequences overlooked, despite research and acknowledgment by the academic community. Sodicity Soil sodicity refers the soil's content of sodium compared to its content of other cations, such as calcium. In high levels, sodium ions break apart clay platelets and cause swelling and dispersion in soil. This results in reduced soil sustainability. If the concentration occurs repeatedly, the soil becomes cement-like, with little or no structure. Extended exposure to high sodium levels results in a decrease in the amount of water retained and able to flow through soil, as well as a decrease in decomposition rates (this leaves the soil infertile and prohibit any future growth). This issue is prominent in Australia, where 1/3 of the land is affected by high levels of salt. It is a natural occurrence, but farming practices such as overgrazing and cultivation have contributed to the rise of it. The options for managing sodic soils are very limited; one must either change the plants or change the soil. The latter is the more difficult process. If changing the soil, one must add calcium to absorb the excess sodium that blocks water flow. Salinisation Soil salinity is the concentration of salt within the soil profile or on the soil surface. Excessive salt directly affects the composition of plants and animals due to varying salt tolerance – along with various physical and chemical changes to the soil, including structural decline and, in the extreme, denudation, exposure to soil erosion, and export of salts to waterways. At low soil salinity, there is a lot of microbial activity, that results in an increase in soil respiration, which increases the carbon dioxide levels in the soil, producing a healthier environment for plants. As the salinity of the soil rises, there is more stress on microbes because there is less available water available to them, leading to less respiration. Soil salinity has localised and regional effects on biodiversity, ranging, for example, from changes in plant composition and survival at a local discharge site through to regional changes in water quality and aquatic life. While very saline soil is not preferred for growing crops, it is important to note that many crops can grow in more saline soils then others. This is important in countries where resources such as fresh water are scarce and needed for drinking, and saline water is able to be used for agriculture. Soil salinity can vary between extremes in a relatively small area; this allows plants to seek areas with less salinity. It is hard to determine which plants are able to grow in soil with high salinity, because the soil salinity is not uniform, even in small areas. However, plants absorb nutrients from areas with lower salinity. Erosion An actively eroding rill on an intensively-farmed field in Germany Soil erosion is the removal of the soil's upper layers by the action of water, wind, or ice. Soil erosion occurs naturally, but human activities can greatly increase its severity. Soil that is healthy is fertile and productive.Sainju, U.M, B.P Singh, and W.F Whitehead. \\"Long-term effects of tillage, cover crops, and nitrogen fertilization on organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations in sandy loam soils in Georgia, USA.\\" Soil and Tillage Research 63.3-4 (2002): 167-79. But soil erosion leads to a loss of topsoil, organic matter, and nutrients; it breaks down soil structure and decreases water storage capacity, in turn reducing fertility and the availability of water to plant roots. Soil erosion is therefore a major threat to soil biodiversity.NSW Government, 2006, New South Wales State of the Environment 2006, Chapter 4: Land, viewed July 2007, The effects of soil erosion can be lessened by means of various soil conservation techniques. These include changes in agricultural practice (such as moving to less erosion-prone crops), the planting of leguminous nitrogen-fixing trees, or trees that are known to replenish organic matter. Also, jute mats and jute geotextile nets can be used to divert and store runoff and control soil movement.Tóth, G., Stolbovoy, V. and Montanarella, 2007. Soil Quality and Sustainability Evaluation - An integrated approach to support soil-related policies of the European Union , EUR 22721 EN. 40 pp. Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg. . Misconstrued soil conservation efforts can result in an imbalance of soil chemical compounds. For example, attempts at afforestation in the northern Loess Plateau, China, have led to nutrient deprivation of organic materials such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Catchment scale impacts Biological systems—both natural and artificial—depend heavily on healthy soils; it is the maintenance of soil health and fertility in all of its dimensions that sustains life. The interconnection spans vast spatial and temporal scales; the major degradation issues of salinity and soil erosion, for instance, can have anywhere from local to regional effects – it may take decades for the consequences of management actions affecting soil to be realised in terms of biodiversity impact. Maintaining soil health is a regional or catchment-scale issue. Because soils are a dispersed asset, the only effective way is to ensure soil health generally is to encourage a broad, consistent, and economically appealing approach. Examples of such approaches as applied to an agricultural setting include the application of lime (calcium carbonate) to reduce acidity so to increase soil health and production, and the transition from conventional farming practices that employ cultivation to limited or no-till systems, which has had a positive impact on improving soil structure. Monitoring and mapping Soils encompass a huge diversity of organisms which makes biodiversity difficult to measure. It is estimated that a football pitch contains underground as much organisms as equal to the size of 500 sheep. A first step has been taken in identifying areas where soil biodiversity is most under pressure is to find the main proxies which decrease soil biodiversity. Soil biodiversity will be measured in the future, especially thanks to the development of molecular approaches relying on direct DNA extraction from the soil matrix.

He headed a military unit during the second British invasion of the Río de la Plata, and worked at the Buenos Aires Cabildo. He took part in the ill-fated Mutiny of Álzaga. Larrea and Domingo Matheu were the only two Spanish-born members of the Primera Junta, the first national government of Argentina. He supported the secretary Mariano Moreno within the Junta, and was moved to the distant city of San Juan when the Morenists were removed from government. He returned as a deputy for Córdoba in the Assembly of Year XIII constituent assembly, promoting many resolutions. Together with Carlos María de Alvear, he organized the strategy for the downfall of the royalist stronghold in Montevideo, a threat to Buenos Aires during the Argentine War of Independence. Despite the victory, he faced political conflicts with admiral William Brown and an economic crisis, and was exiled from the country. He moved to Bordeaux, France, but returned to Buenos Aires when his exile was lifted by the Oblivion law. He served as consul for a time, but his business declined and he committed suicide on June 20, 1847. He was the last surviving member of the Primera Junta. Biography=Early life and Viceroyalty Juan Larrea was born on June 24, 1782, in the city of Mataró, Catalonia. His father was Martín Ramón de Larrea, who was in charge of customs operations in Mataró, and his mother was Tomasa Espeso. He studied mathematics and navigation, and focused his education towards a career in commerce. His father died in 1793, so Larrea became the patriarch of the family. They moved to Buenos Aires, where he established a warehouse for wines, leather, and sugar. He traded with Peru, Upper Peru, Paraguay, Chile and colonial Brazil. By 1806 he was a well respected businessman, and a syndic of the Royal Consulate. He promoted the role of deputies from Buenos Aires at the Madrid court, to better the representation of the Brazilian viceroyalty and reduce the privileges of peninsular merchants.National..., p. 263 Buenos Aires and other nearby cities faced the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806 and 1807. In the absence of reinforcements from Spain, viceroy Santiago de Liniers arranged that everyone in Buenos Aires capable of bearing arms should join the resistance against the second invasion. Larrea established the Legion of Catalan Volunteers with Jaime Nadal y Guarda, Jaime Lavallol and José Olaguer Reynals. Larrea was appointed captain of this military unit. The defense was successful, and the British were driven away from the viceroyalty. Larrea's business prospered, and in 1808 the Buenos Aires Cabildo appointed him to oversee a naval patrol to suppress shipments of contraband. This gave him an opportunity to put his nautical skills to use. He also participated in the secret meetings of patriots who promoted political change, and joined the 1809 Mutiny of Álzaga, which attempted to depose viceroy Liniers and replace him with a Junta. The mutiny failed, but the patriots continued to plot, and in 1810 the May Revolution succeeded in deposing the new viceroy. Larrea did not take part in the discussions at the open cabildo, but was appointed as member of the Primera Junta.National..., p. 264 Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a freemason.The list includes Juan Bautista Alberdi, Manuel Alberti, Carlos María de Alvear, Miguel de Azcuénaga, Antonio González de Balcarce, Manuel Belgrano, Antonio Luis Beruti, Juan José Castelli, Domingo French, Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid, Francisco Narciso de Laprida , Juan Larrea, Juan Lavalle, Vicente López y Planes, Bartolomé Mitre, Mariano Moreno, Juan José Paso, Carlos Pellegrini, Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and Justo José de Urquiza. José de San Martín is known to have been a member of the Lautaro Lodge; but whether the lodge was truly masonic has been debated: Primera Junta Lithograph of the members of the Primera Junta Larrea's prestige as an influential businessman promoted his appointment as member of the Primera Junta. However, as with the other members, the precise reasons for his inclusion are unclear. The Junta's membership has been considered a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists.Luna, p. 39 Larrea resigned his wages from his position as Junta member, and organized the resources for the upcoming war of independence. Together with Manuel de Sarratea he drafted a new code regulating business in Argentina, and he also secured the exile of former viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros by bribing the captain of the ship carrying him, the Dart, to avoid any landfall until reaching the Canary Islands on the far side of the Atlantic. He supported the execution of Liniers after the defeat of his counter-revolution, and supported the secretary Mariano Moreno against the president Cornelio Saavedra.National..., pp. 264–265 Larrea voted for the incorporation of deputies from other cities into the Junta, although he had previously indicated his opposition to the proposal. It was intended by Saavedra that this change would reduce Moreno's influence within the Junta.Galasso, p. 113 The proposal prevailed, and the Primera Junta became the Junta Grande by incorporating the new deputies. The resignation and death of Mariano Moreno did not reduce the conflicts between Morenists and Saavedrists. A rebellion on behalf of Saavedrism ensued, on 5 and 6 April 1811, aiming at the resignation of all remaining Morenists, including Larrea.Galasso, p. 128 Larrea was accused of joining factions and risking public security, and was deposed. Taken prisoner, he was moved to the nearby city of Luján, and then to the distant San Juan.National..., p. 265 Return to politics Meeting of the Assembly of Year XIII. Lithograph of the time. Larrea resumed business activities in San Juan, avoiding politics until 1812. The Revolution of October 8, 1812 returned the Morenists to power, and so Larrea could return to Buenos Aires. He returned as a deputy for Córdoba to the Assembly of Year XIII constituent assembly. In the assembly, Larrea promoted a customs law which taxed most imports, but made exceptions for machines, scientific tools, books, weapons and military supplies. He organized a local mint, and the supply of the Army of the North. The presidency of the assembly rotated, and Larrea presided from April 30 to June 1, 1813. During this time the Assembly outlawed torture and repealed all noble titles, and also chose the official Argentine National Anthem.National..., pp. 265-266 Larrea served briefly in the Second Triumvirate, replacing José Julián Pérez as finance minister, until the Assembly replaced the Triumvirate with the Supreme Director, an office placing the powers of head of state in the hands of one person. Gervasio Antonio de Posadas was chosen as the first Supreme Director. Posadas was concerned about Montevideo, a nearby city which had been under royalist control since the beginning of the war, and a constant threat to Buenos Aires. Carlos María de Alvear complemented the existing siege of Montevideo with a naval blockade, in which Larrea's expertise was instrumental. Alvear developed the military strategy, and Larrea took care of the financial aspects. Larrea drafted a report of the nature, costs and strength of the proposed navy, and the captains and sailors that were required, and planned to negotiate with the American William White. Larrea also appointed the Irish admiral William Brown to lead the attack. The royalist forces in Montevideo were finally defeated in June, 1814.National..., pp. 266–267Ratto, pp. 33–73 Larrea did not get on well with Brown, who blamed him for disagreements and supply shortages, and even for discontent among the sailors. Buenos Aires did not have a naval tradition, and therefore most of the people involved in the naval campaign were foreigners. As a result, their commitment to the war was often limited. After the capture of Montevideo, Larrea instructed Brown to report directly to the minister of war, and not correspond with himself. Nevertheless, the disagreements continued. Due to the economic crisis caused by the war, Larrea sold the captured ships, decommissioned the navy and sold off the government's own ships, but the sailors complained that they had not received their wages, their reward for the military victory nor their percentage of the sale of the captured ships. Larrea and White were blamed for this. Larrea resigned by the end of the year, after signing an order for the creation of an infantry and a cavalry regiment for the Army of the Andes. Larrea blamed White for the unresolved dispute over the sailors' wages, declaring that he had arranged that White would organize the payment of the wages. Alvear resigned in 1815 after the mutiny of Álvarez Thomas, and all the members of his administration were put on trial. Larrea was accused of abuse of power, administrative fraud and stealing from the national treasury. All his properties were confiscated, and he was exiled.National..., pp. 267–269Ratto, pp. 75–93 Exile and return After his exile, Larrea moved to Bordeaux in France, and did business with some of his old associates. He continued correspondence with Bernardino Rivadavia, and in 1818 he moved to Montevideo, under Brazilian control at that time, and strengthened his contacts in Buenos Aires from there. He was finally able to return to Buenos Aires in 1822 due to the oblivion law.National..., p. 269 Once he returned to Buenos Aires, Larrea avoided political activities and concentrated on business activities. He established a mailing service between Buenos Aires and Le Havre (France), but the venture failed. He then worked in animal husbandry, both in Buenos Aires and in Montevideo. He was appointed consul of the United Provinces by governor Manuel Dorrego, and moved back to Bordeaux to strengthen commerce with France. He resigned as consul in 1830, shortly after the first appointment of Juan Manuel de Rosas as governor, and returned to private business once more. His business began to fail, and he lived at various times in Montevideo, Colonia del Sacramento and Bordeaux, before returning again to Buenos Aires. He committed suicide on June 20, 1847.

Betalains are a class of red and yellow tyrosine-derived pigments found in plants of the Caryophyllales, where they replace anthocyanin pigments. Betalains also occur in some higher order fungi. They are most often noticeable in the petals of flowers, but may color the fruits, leaves, stems, and roots of plants that contain them. They include pigments such as those found in beets. Description Swiss chard, showing one plant expressing yellow betaxanthins and another expressing red betacyanins. The name \\"betalain\\" comes from the Latin name of the common beet (Beta vulgaris), from which betalains were first extracted. The deep red color of beets, bougainvillea, amaranth, and many cacti results from the presence of betalain pigments. The particular shades of red to purple are distinctive and unlike that of anthocyanin pigments found in most plants. There are two categories of betalains: * Betacyanins include the reddish to violet betalain pigments. Among the betacyanins present in plants include betanin, isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin. * Betaxanthins are those betalain pigments which appear yellow to orange. Among the betaxanthins present in plants include vulgaxanthin, miraxanthin, portulaxanthin, and indicaxanthin. The physiological function of betalains in plants is uncertain, but there is some evidence that they may have fungicidal properties. Additionally, betalains have been found in fluorescent flowers, though their role in these plants is also uncertain. Chemistry Chemical structure of betanin. It was once thought that betalains were related to anthocyanins, the reddish pigments found in most plants. Both betalains and anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments found in the vacuoles of plant cells. However, betalains are structurally and chemically unlike anthocyanins and the two have never been found in the same plant together. For example, betalains contain nitrogen whereas anthocyanins do not. It is now known that betalains are aromatic indole derivatives synthesized from tyrosine. They are not related chemically to the anthocyanins and are not even flavonoids. Each betalain is a glycoside, and consists of a sugar and a colored portion. Their synthesis is promoted by light. The most heavily studied betalain is betanin, also called beetroot red after the fact that it may be extracted from red beet roots. Betanin is a glucoside, and hydrolyzes into the sugar glucose and betanidin. It is used as a food coloring agent, and the color is sensitive to pH. Other betalains known to occur in beets are isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin. The color and antioxidant capacity of betanin and indicaxanthin (betaxanthin derived of -proline) are affected by dielectric microwave heating. Addition of TFE (2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) is reported to improve the hydrolytic stability of some betalains in aqueous solution. Furthermore, a betanin-europium(III) complex has been used to detect calcium dipicolinate in bacterial spores, including Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus. Other important betacyanins are amaranthine and isoamaranthine, isolated from species of Amaranthus. Taxonomic significance Flowers of the cactus Mammillaria sp. contain betalains. Betalain pigments occur only in the Caryophyllales and some Basidiomycota (mushrooms), for instance Hygrophoraceae (waxcaps). Where they occur in plants, they sometimes coexist with anthoxanthins (yellow to orange flavonoids), but never occur in plant species with anthocyanins. Among the flowering plant order Caryophyllales, most members produce betalains and lack anthocyanins. Of all the families in the Caryophyllales, only the Caryophyllaceae (carnation family) and Molluginaceae produce anthocyanins instead of betalains. The limited distribution of betalains among plants is a synapomorphy for the Caryophyllales, though their production has been lost in two families. Economic uses Inflorescences of Amaranthus caudatus (love- lies-bleeding) contain large quantities of betacyanins. Betanin is commercially used as a natural food dye. It can cause beeturia (red urine) and red feces in some people who are unable to break it down. The interest of the food industry in betalains has grown since they were identified by in vitro methods as antioxidants, which may protect against oxidation of low-density lipoproteins. Semisynthetic derivatives Betanin extracted from the red beet was used as starting material for the semisynthesis of an artificial betalainic coumarin, which was applied as a fluorescent probe for the live- cell imaging of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes.

The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use “Target” rather than “Task”. Job interview candidates who describe a “Target” they set themselves instead of an externally imposed “Task” emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance. * Action: What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it and what the alternatives were. * Results: What was the outcome of your actions?

It is a shrub with one densely branching, spreading main stem, small leaves and dense heads of creamy-white flowers, giving rise to the common names \\"lambswool\\" and \\"cauliflower\\". It is widespread over its range but becoming less common because of land clearing and illegal collecting of the flowers. Description Verticordia eriocephala is a shrub which grows to a height of or more and a spread of and which has a single, highly branched stem at its base. Its leaves are elliptic in shape, dished and long, becoming shorter and broader near the flowering parts at the top. The flowers are scented and arranged in dense corymb-like groups, each flower on a stalk about long. The floral cup is hemispherical, long, constricted above the middle and hairy near its base. The sepals are creamy- white, long, with 5 hairy lobes and with one or two slender cilia extending out . The petals are white, broadly egg-shaped to almost round, about long, with a finely toothed edge. The style is straight, long and glabrous. Flowering time is from September to January and the plant may flower after attaining a height of only . The leaves of this species are shorter and wider than those of Verticordia polytricha and is distinguished from that species and from Verticordia capillaris by the extent of hairiness in the flowering structures. It is also similar in appearance to Verticordia brownii. Taxonomy and naming Early collections of this verticordia were made in the 1890s by Richard Helms and more reliably, by William Vincent Fitzgerald in 1898 and for many years it was incorrectly described as Verticordia brownii. Verticordia eriocephala was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 and the description was published in Nuytsia from specimens collected near Mount Adams, north of Eneabba by Alex and Elizabeth George. According to Alex George, the specific epithet (eriocephala) is derived from the Greek erion (wool) and cephala (head), in reference to the appearance of the flowering plants as large white heads. Elizabeth George mentioned cephale as Greek word for \\"head\\" instead. The ancient Greek word for \\"head\\" is kephalē (κεφαλή).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press. George placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Corymbiformis along with V. polytricha, V. densiflora, V. brownii, and V. capillaris. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in yellow, grey, and white sands and on gravel and is widespread on sand hills and plains. It occasionally occupies granite sites, and is often seen growing with other verticordia species. It occurs throughout the south-west from as far north as Mount Adams to as far east as Point Culver and as far inland as Boorabbin National Park. Conservation Verticordia eriocephala is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, however its number are decreasing due to illegal harvesting of flowers from wild plants. Use in horticulture This species is an attractive shrub when in bud and in flower and its dense bushy habit make it useful when not in flower. It strikes readily from cuttings but suitable material is often hard to obtain, even from cultivated specimens. It can also be propagated from seed. Established plants are hardy and frost tolerant but are killed by pruning when the entire flowering head is cut below the foliage.

The first of its kind was founded at the University of Halle, by Professor Callenberg in 1724. The great interest which Franz Delitzsch took in the conversion of the Jews to Christianity prompted him to establish a similar course at the University of Leipzig in 1886, and another was founded by Prof. H. L.Strack in Berlin the same year. The institutes of Leipzig and Berlin have courses in New Testament theology with reference to the Messianic passages in the Old Testament, and they also give instruction in rabbinic literature; they further publish works helpful to their cause, as biographies of famous converts, controversial pamphlets, autobiographies of converted Jews, and occasionally scientific tracts. The Berlin institute has published Strack's \\"Introduction to the Talmud,\\" his editions of some tractates of the Mishnah, and a monograph on the blood accusation. A special feature of its publications is the New Testament in Hebrew and Yiddish translations. After the death of Strack, the Institutum Judaicum lessened its missionary drive and shifted its focus to research on post-biblical Judaism. Under pressure by Jewish scholars such as J. Jeremias, research was contextualized under the aim of understanding Christian-Jewish relations in the wake of 20th century anti- Semitism and the consequences of World War II.

New World was a prominent landmark along Jalan Besar, in modern-day Kallang planing area, as it occupied a large area of in size. Before the arrival of televisions and radios, it attracted people from all walks of life from labourers to Europeans with its exciting attractions such as striptease, cabaret girls, opera shows and boxing matches during its heyday. Of all the artistes and athletes who have performed at the New World through the years, four have left a lasting impression – striptease queen Rose Chan, wrestler King Kong, strongman Mat Tarzan, and boxer Felix Boy. With the advent of shopping centres, discos and, particularly, television in the ensuing decades, the park business gradually became poor, and it was finally closed for good after being sold to a property developer for redevelopment in 1987. History New World was set up on 1 August 1923 by two Straits Chinese brothers, Ong Boon Tat and Ong Peng Hock under the company Ong Sam Leong Ltd.National Heritage Board, \\"Ong Sam Leong (1857—1918)\\". In the 1930s, the Shaw Organisation expanded their leisure business with a 50% joint venture with Ong Sam Leong Ltd. Shaw eventually bought out their partner and owned both the New World and the Great World at Kim Seng Road. Admission fee was only 10-cent per entry but visitors had to pay separately for its various entertainment programmes and hawker stalls within. Advertising itself as the \\"pioneer amusement park in Malaya\\", New World had a huge fairground for all walks of life; couples would go to the park for evening strolls, housewives frequented the food and diverse stalls, men would hop from the barber shops to the nightclubs, while families piled into the cinemas and onto fairground rides like ferris wheels and carousels where two of its rides, the Ghost Train and Dodg'em were crowd-pullers. In 1934, Dato Roland St. John Braddell, who was born in Singapore and served as Municipal Commissioner (1914—1929) wrote: 'Taxi-girls' At New World, a great number of men would come daily to \\"ronggeng\\" (Malay word for \\"social dance\\") or cha-cha with cheongsam-clad cabaret girls, known as 'taxi-girls' as they could be \\"hired\\" for dancing by anyone with a coupon. The dance floor could hold up to 500 twirling couples and each dance was registered on a card. Three dances cost a dollar and the girls were only paid 8 cents per dance.National Heritage Board, \\"New World\\". The earliest customers would secure their preferred dancers and also got seats nearest to the dancing girls. The girls were usually local or hailed from Hong Kong, Thailand and the Philippines. The girls were not call-girls; no naughty business was expected or allowed by their male partners.Brazil, \\"The World of Tiger Lillies\\", pp. 176—178. Watchful bouncers would ensure that such decorum was followed and they would not hesitate to throw out any trouble-makers or drunks found in the premises. Bruce Lockhart, a British army intelligence officer-cum-journalist, described his visit to the New World's dance hall: During the Japanese Occupation, New World was renamed Shin Segal and turned into a gambling farm opened only to civilians but not Japanese soldiers. As commodities were scarce during the Occupation, the park was also turned into a black market selling necessities at inflated prices.Brazil, \\"Hard Times at the Worlds\\", p. 179. Striptease After the war, the park roared back into life again when it was widely patronised by Allied soldiers and returning expatriates with their families. With the departure of those troops that resulted in much lower takings, the park decided to come up with a new attraction in 1949 – striptease. Madame Tai Fong, a former singer and dancer, started the Fong Fong Revue, introducing new dances and comedy routines, with exciting costumes for her girls that became the first known striptease public entertainment in Singapore. Her revues were soon pulling in huge crowds; the crowds got worse to the point that the colonial police had to moved in to manage crowd control and issued a final warning that \\"this monkey business must cease\\".Brazil, \\"Striptease arrives\\", p. 179. Striptease was thus stopped in its tracks but in time, it resurfaced back in New World again when Rose Chan took over the centre-stage in the 1950s. Rose Chan Wai Cheng, who was China-born but locally raised, took up her striptease act when she was 27. She was known as the local Queen of Strip and took her acts around the three Worlds.Brazil, \\"Rose Chan\\", p. 179. She was famous for her python act; in which she cavorted with a large and sinuous python, coiling it provocatively round her bare body. Despite being labelled by conservatives as a 'rebel', she was kind hearted and gave money to charities and orphanages. She gave up her striptease career when she embarked on a new career – operating a hotel and restaurant in Jalan Raja Laut, Kuala Lumpur in 1976. In 1989, she died of cancer at the age of 62 in Penang but her memory lingers. A movie based on her life was made in 2008 by Royston Tan, a local movie director of 881 fame. Wrestler 'King Kong' A Hungarian-born professional wrestler, Emile Czaya, who weighed 236 kg in his prime and was often described as the \\"King Kong\\" or the \\"Hungarian Behemoth\\". An actor in his younger days, he took the name of \\"King Kong\\" after acting as the gorilla in the film of the same name. He won the heavyweight wrestling title of Europe three times and the middleweight title once. In 1938, he went to Singapore at the age of 19 with a troupe of European wrestlers to perform at the New World. Known for being \\"the meanest\\" amongst the wrestlers at New World, a former spectator, Abdul Wahab Mohamad said King Kong was the wrestler fans just loved to hate: \\"He would be challenging and threatening the jeering fans to get into the ring with him. He always won his fights. He was always too big and too strong for his opponents.\\" On 12 March 1970, Czaya was driving back to Singapore after a bout in Penang when his car crashed into a wall in Ipoh and he was badly injured. He was moved to the Outram Road General Hospital in Singapore but died on 15 May at the age of 61. Strongman 'Mat Tarzan' Ahmad Ali, better known as Mat Tarzan (or \\"Tarzan of Malaya\\"), was a well-known Malaysian strongman. Mat hailed from Penang and was the son of the late Haji Ali, who used to be a chef at Kedah House, now known as Istana Kedah in Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah. During his prime, his famous feats included pulling with his teeth a lorry carrying 15 adults which would weigh about three tons, and bending iron bars across his throat. He could also lift 73 kilogram of weights from the floor with his teeth and dive through a burning wooden frame spiked with eight sharp blades and wrestled with full-grown pythons. He had won various bodybuilding titles such as Mr Penang Health Culture League in 1959, 1960 and 1961, Mr Body Beautiful in 1963 and Mr Penang in 1966. Mat Tarzan was also a good cook in his own right, having picked up some useful culinary skills from his father, specialising in Malay dishes such as mee bandung, ox-tail soup and satay which he ran a chain of food stalls in Malaysia since the 1960s to the present day. Boxer 'Felix Boy' New World also hosted weekly boxing tournaments with fighters from Thailand, Philippines, Australia, as well as local pugilists. Malaysian boxer Felix Boy, who was born S. Sinniah, became a household name in the early 1960s. He stood just 1.5 metres tall but packed a terrific wallop in both fists and often despatched his taller opponents by the second or third round in the flyweight and bantamweight divisions. Out of 84 fights, he lost two – both to Thai boxers. Sinniah had a tragic childhood. At the age of five, his parents were captured and sent by the Japanese to work on the Death Railway in Thailand, and they died there. As a result, he and his elder brother, Shanmugam, were taken in by an orphanage. At nine, he used to watch a skilful Thai boxer in action at New World and that was the beginning of his interest in boxing. A French priest, Father Louis Ribaud of the St Joseph's Orphanage in Jalan Penang where Sinniah grew up, gave him the name of \\"Felix Boy\\" which was to bring him fame and glory in the ring in later years. Sakura Teng, Wang Sa and Ye Fong New World was also the place where Sakura Teng, a well-known 1970s Malaysian songbird, launched her music career at age 17. During her heyday in the 1960s and 1970s, the A go-go Queen as she was nicknamed, cut more than 50 records and was best known for her yodelling. The late popular stand-up comics, Wang Sa and Ye Fong, held their regular stage shows at New World too. Closure New World faded from the night scene after the 1960s in the face of rival entertainment attractions such as shopping centres, discos and particularly television which took off locally in 1963.Brazil, \\"Coming of the End\\", p. 181. In April 1987, New World finally closed when Shaw Organisation sold the freehold site for S$35 million (US$23 million), to City Developments, a property firm owned by Kwek Leng Beng and his family for future commercial redevelopment. The now defunct gateway of New World, circa December 2010 Today, the site where the park sat is being developed by City Developments Limited for its City Square project, comprising a 910-unit condominium (City Square Residences), an eight-storey shopping mall (City Square Mall) and a public park (City Green). New World's iconic Lion Gate became the only relic left of the park now The park, which was completed in 2009, featured the original gate to the former New World when the refurbished gate was moved to the right side of the park's entrance in late 2010.

It was first released in 1983 as an arcade game, then later ported to the Atari 2600, ColecoVision, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. In Up'n Down the player drives a car forward and backward along a branching, vertically scrolling track, collecting flags and jumping on other cars to destroy them.  Gameplay  Arcade original Up'n Down is a vertically scrolling game that employs a pseudo-3D perspective. The player controls a purple dune buggy that resembles a Volkswagen Beetle. The buggy moves forward along a single-lane path; pressing up or down on the joystick causes the buggy to speed up or slow down, pressing right or left causes the buggy to switch lanes at an intersection, and pressing the \\"jump\\" button causes the buggy to jump in the air. Jumping is required to avoid other cars on the road; the player can either jump all the way over them, or land on them for points. To complete a round, the player must collect 10 colored flags by running over them with the buggy. If the player passes by a flag without picking it up, it will appear again later in the round. The roads feature inclines and descents that affect the buggy's speed, and bridges that must be jumped. A player loses a turn whenever the buggy either collides with another vehicle without jumping on it, or jumps off the road and into the grass or water.  Atari 2600 port  Atari 2600 port Sega released a port for the Atari 2600 in 1984 with jarring background music. According to Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory, and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design by Karen Collins, the arcade version's \\"bluesy F-sharp minor groove\\" was transformed into \\"a very unsettling version based in C minor with a flattened melodic sound\\" because of limitations of the 2600 sound hardware.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Up'n Down on their November 1, 1983 issue as being the second most-successful new table arcade unit of the year.

The series aired on the Los Angeles ABC television affiliate KABC-TVNewsweek May 24, 1954, p. 84, TV-Radio \\"Vampire\\"TV Guide July 17–23, 1954 p. 10, \\"Local Ghoul Makes Good\\" from April 30, 1954, through April 2, 1955. The weekly series was produced and created by Hunt Stromberg, Jr., and featured the Vampira character created by Maila Nurmi. Though the show was unseen outside of the Los Angeles area, The Vampira Show has become a cult classic, spawning fan clubs all over the world. Background The costume of Nurmi's Vampira character was inspired by the spooky The New Yorker cartoons of Charles Addams,Newsweek, May 24, 1954, p. 84. TV-Radio, \\"Vampire\\" later adapted for the TV series The Addams Family in 1964. As Nurmi told Boxoffice in a 1994 interview, she had dressed as Addams' at-the-time nameless ghoul-woman to attend Lester Horton's annual Hollywood costume ball the Bal Caribe in 1953. Nurmi's ghoul woman beat out over 2,000 attendees to win the evening's prize for best costume where she drew the attention of Hunt Stromberg, Jr., a Hollywood producer. When Stromberg approached Nurmi about doing the character for television, Nurmi then re- imagined the character and costume as a buxom and glamorous single vampire instead of the mother of a family, and she named her creation Vampira. Nurmi told Boxoffice that her intention was to invent a unique creation of her own that was \\"campier and sexier\\" than the mute and flat-chested Addams character, in part to avoid plagiarizing Addams' intellectual property. Vampira was known to appear in broad daylight in full costume.Life, June 14, 1954 p. 107, Television, \\"Good Evening, I Am Vampira: A scary femme fatale peddles old horror films on TV\\" Her husband Dean Riesner refused to appear in public with his wife in her Vampira costume.Newsweek, May 24, 1954, p. 84, TV-Radio \\"Vampire\\" Vampira's personality was based on elements of several silent film actresses including Theda Bara and Gloria Swanson. The Vampira character was influenced by the Evil Queen from Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and from the Dragon Lady character in the Terry and the Pirates comic strip.Vamps: An Illustrated History of the Femme Fatale by Pam Keesey, 1997 San Francisco, Cleis Press. p. 17, . The new costume was inspired by the artwork of John Willie featured in the fetish magazine Bizarre. Synopsis Each show began with the spectral image of the wasp-waisted Vampira gliding through knee-deep fog down a dark corridor toward the viewer. At the end of her trance-like walk she would suddenly let out a long, piercing scream as the camera zoomed in on her face.Life June 14, 1954 p. 107, TELEVISION \\"Good Evening, I Am Vampira – A scary femme fatale peddles old horror films on TV\\" She would then smile and coyly remark, \\"Screaming relaxes me so.\\" After that Nurmi would sit on a Victorian double-ended sofa decorated with skulls and introduce the movie of the night, sometimes pausing to play with her pet spider Rolo, talk with off-camera ghosts, torment her advertiser, Fletcher Jones, in amusing commercials, or drink a Vampira Cocktail at her poison bar. The show's theme music was from the Adagio movement in Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta by Béla Bartók and excerpts from Uranus from The Planets by Gustav Holst. Nurmi's salary for the show was $75 per week. The show's concept of having a themed host introduce films was fresh at the time and had never been done before. In later years, stations all over the world would duplicate its format with similar hosts. The Vampira Show was seen in the Los Angeles area only but was featured in articles and photo spreads in Newsweek, TV Guide and Life within weeks of its first broadcast. The show and its hostess were an instant success and led to Nurmi's appearance on numerous 1950s television shows including The Red Skelton Show and Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town.Eder, Bruce. Allmovie In David J. Skal's book, The Monster Show, Skal revealed that James Dean, a friend of Maila's at the time before he became famous in films, appeared with his back to the camera in one Vampira episode, where she was dressed as a dominant schoolteacher and rapped his knuckles. Cancellation Despite its popularity, the series was canceled in 1955 when Nurmi refused to sell her rights to the character to ABC. Nurmi revived the series for a short time in 1956 on KHJ-TV. After the series' demise, Nurmi appeared in the cult film Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), dressed as Vampira and credited under that name but out of character. Nurmi told Boxoffice that Wood's dialogue was so awful she sought and received permission to perform her entire role in a mute and spellbound manner she referred to as \\"Maila in an Alpha state.\\" Nurmi also performed as Vampira in a Las Vegas stage show titled Come as You Are with Liberace. Revival and changes In 1981, KHJ-TV hired Nurmi to recreate The Vampira Show.The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead (3 ed.) by J. Gordon Melton, 2010. Visible Ink Press. p. 738. . When Nurmi quit the project, a new character, Elvira (portrayed by Cassandra Peterson), replaced her. By 1982, Elvira's Movie Macabre was syndicated in over 80 markets across the United States. Nurmi later sued Peterson for copying the Vampira persona. However, the case was dismissed. In a 1988 interview with Skip E. Lowe provoking Nurmi repeatedly for comments on Vampira vs. Elvira, Nurmi stated \\"There are at least 80 similarities. It's identical; it's my show\\". Later in the interview, again under provoking from Lowe, Nurmi stated, of Elvira, that \\"In February of '82 she proceeded to emulate my performance exactly and prior to that she didn't know exactly how to do Vampira, but then now she emulates every gesture.\\" Lowe continued using this provoking approach to bring the conversation back to the Vampira vs. Elvira subject throughout the interview, even after the conversation had moved on to other topics several times.YouTube: Vampira (Maila Nurmi)--Rare 1988 TV Interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKIUxdgXsa8) - Comments begin at minute 1:55 and run throughout the end of the 26-minute interview Episode status The original Vampira Show has never aired outside the Los Angeles area due to it being originally broadcast live and not being preserved as kinescopes for future airings. No footage of the show is known to exist, however, in the 1990s a kinescope advertising the station's ability to draw clients to advertisers featuring Nurmi in character was discovered. The clips used in the kinescope were re-shot segments using a previous episode's script. Scenes from the kinescope film were featured in the 1995 Finnish documentary about Nurmi, About Sex, Death and Taxes, and in the 2006 film Vampira: The Movie. In 2007, the kinescope film of Nurmi in character was restored by Rerunmedia, whose previous work includes restoring footage from The Ed Sullivan Show and Dark Shadows. The restoration utilized the LiveFeed Video Imaging process developed exclusively for the restoration of kinescopes. The restoration was funded by Spectropia Wunderhaus and Coffin Case. A reconstructed episode of The Vampira Show was released from the Vampira's Attic web site in October 2007. The release imitated a complete episode by using existing footage of the show combined with vintage commercials and a full-length feature film. In popular culture In 1994, director Tim Burton cast actress Lisa Marie as Nurmi/Vampira for the film Ed Wood. The film also featured a short recreation of The Vampira Show.

Aswad, Richard Kraft, and Nicholas Kraft. It premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on January 27, 2006 and continued to play in over 75 film festivals around the globe.San Diego Union Tribune - Festival is packed with local talent - David Elliott - September 23, 2007 . Plot Finding Kraftland is structured as a top ten countdown of the coolest attractions in Kraftland, which is the name given to Richard Kraft's house. Though the host, Stacey, continually bounces around between Richard Kraft's collectibles, the real focus of the film is the bond that develops between Richard and his son Nicholas. Richard remarks that, when Nicholas was born, he didn't know what to make of him, saying he felt as though an \\"alien being\\" was living with him. He then goes on to say that, around the time Nicholas turns 3, he realizes that he is \\"the most interesting person on the planet.\\" This begins a whirl-wind love affair between father and son that sees the two trek around the globe in order to ride every roller coaster, launch themselves into a zero-gravity flight, and generally seek as many thrills as life has to offer. This story unfolds as Richard's collection, which consists of James Bond collectibles from the 1960s, pieces of Disneyland and Walt Disney World attractions, thousands of board games, and advertising memorabilia from Richard's childhood, is displayed and pored over by Stacy. The other story line that develops is Richard's relationship with his deceased parents and older brother, David Kraft, who died in 1993 due to Crohn's disease. The documentary comes to a climax when it is discovered that Richard has also developed Crohn's. Music Marc Shaiman provides a musical interlude with his performance of a song titled \\"Yes\\" which he wrote for his agent, Richard Kraft. The song pokes fun at Richard's inability to say \\"no\\" to any film project. Nicholas Kraft also composed a piano piece for the film called Kronicles of Kraftland. It serves as the soundtrack for the ending montage. It is the only original piece of music in the film as all the other cues were picked by Richard Kraft from his extensive film music library. Austin Wintory composed 21 variations of Kronicles of Kraftland titled Kronicles of Kraftland: 21 Film Score Parody Variations on a Theme as a 21st birthday present for Nicholas. The variations are all parodies of Richard Kraft's favorite composers. Production Finding Kraftland was intended to be shown once at a joint birthday party for the Krafts and was made as a sweet 16 present for Nicholas from his father. The reception at the showing was so great that they decided to submit the documentary to festivals.

It is one of the most famous Korean traditional dances and designated as South Korea's important intangible cultural asset number 27 in 1969. It has been developed into a solo dance by professional dancers. Origins There is little extant evidence regarding how Seungmu was created. Based on analyses of forms and movements of Seungmu, some researchers have suggested that it may derived from other Buddhist ritual dances or ethnic or folk dances.Seungmu (Monk Dance) , National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage. Retrieved on September 26, 2007. Some said that Seungmu came from bubgo dance, a Buddhist ritual dance. It was once prohibited during the Joseon dynasty era, and then it was transformed into a folk dance and developed mostly by kisaengs.

The seungmu integrates the eight rhythmic cycles: yeombul, dodeuri, taryeong, jajin taryeong, gutgeori, dwit gutgeori, gujeong nori, and saesanjo. Every now and then, when one rhythm shifts to another, the dancer changes the mood by changing his steps.Seungmu (monk dance), KOREA.net. Retrieved on September 26, 2007.

The first of the two videos, which was released in 1998, became the best-selling video to date for Good Vibrations, a sex-toy business. The video was also featured on The Daily Show. The videos promote the idea, as Eye Weekly puts it, that \\"fucking your boyfriend in the ass is fun\\". The videos star sexologist Carol Queen, who discusses pegging and also demonstrates the practice with her lover. The videos also contain footage of other couples engaging in the practice. The porn star Chloe appears in the second video; as she is best known as an anal queen, her use of a strap-on dildo is a \\"role reversal\\". Bend Over Boyfriend (1998) and Bend Over Boyfriend 2 (1999) were created, produced, and directed by lesbian couple Shar Rednour and Jackie Strano, owners and founders of SIR Video Productions. The movies feature real life couples. BOB was co-produced with Nan Kinney of Fatale Media and was nominated for Best Specialty Release at the 1999 AVN Awards. Dan Savage, who popularized the term pegging, originally offered \\"bob\\" (short for \\"Bend over Boyfriend\\") as one of two alternatives for the term. Reception Some reviewers, such as Eye Weekly, said the tapes are instructional to a fault, saying the presentation \\"made anal sex seem more distasteful rather than more attractive\\". Queen herself said she'd been told the first video was \\"like watching a driving-instruction video\\" and the subtitle of Bend Over Boyfriend 2: Less Talkin', More Rockin' attempts to address this concern. Tristan Taormino, writing for the Village Voice, credits the video as an archetype for a substantial cultural shift: \\"The roles of active initiator and penetrator are no longer solely the domain of men, nor are the qualities of receptivity and passivity for girls only. Nowhere is this more apparent than in what I identify as the Bend Over Boyfriend Archetype.\\" Taormino also went on to add that the video makers were resistant to visualizing or showing close-ups of the male buttocks in this video.
