Martina L√∂w (born 9 January 1965 in W√ºrzburg, West Germany) is a German sociologist. Vita Martina L√∂w graduated in 1993 at the Goethe-University Frankfurt by Marianne Rodenstein with the thesis \\"Raum ergreifen. Frauen zwischen Arbeit, sozialen Beziehungen und der Kultur des Selbst‚Äú. The habilitation was completed in 2000 in the Department of History, Philosophy and Social Sciences at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg and she was awarded the Christian Wolff Prize for her previous work, in particular for her habilitation thesis on Sociology of Space. From January 2002 to July 2013 she was Professor of Sociology at the Technical University of Darmstadt with a focus on spatial social analysis, urban and regional sociology as well as women's and gender studies. Since then she has been Professor of Sociology of Architecture and Planning at the Technical University of Berlin. She is speaker of the Collaborative Research Center 1265 Re-Figuration of Spaces. From 2011 to March 2013 she was Chairwoman of the German Sociological Association. Work In 2001 Martina L√∂w published a much-noticed study on the Sociology of Space theorizing the constitution of space as a social phenomenon and hence a function of societal developments and action. Space is conceived as a relational ordering of social goods and living beings established by acts of synthesizing and placing these elements. This process approach to the conception of space contrasts with sociology‚Äôs predominant view regarding space as the static (or preexisting) background of social processes. Based on this novel approach, L√∂w investigates how the social production of space is being transformed within and through electronic networks. Further research focuses on the relation between space, power and social differentiation, and also includes ethnographic studies in urban contexts. In the field of urban research, L√∂w is widely known for a new approach to analyzing the ‚Äúintrinsic logic of cities‚Äù. This logic implies a complex ensemble of knowledge stocks, means of expressions and manifestations, which are intrinsically related and based on rule-governed, routinized forms of actions stabilized by specific resources. This line of argument implies that, over time, cities condense into distinct provinces of meaning. From 2008 onward, L√∂w was coordinator of the focus project ‚ÄúIntrinsic Logic of Cities‚Äú, a cooperation between the Technical University Darmstadt and the University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt, supported by the Land of Hessen Offensive for the development of scientific and economic excellence (LOEWE) program. ‚ÄúIntrinsic logic‚Äù is a working concept to capture the specific, or ‚Äútypical‚Äù characteristics of a city and its implicitly operative meaning-making processes. The research objective here is to analyze a city‚Äôs fundamental structures and investigate relationships and similarities between cities, methodologically based on the instrument of city comparisons. The intrinsic logic approach radically differs from methods used by most urban researchers doing research within cities but assuming the latter are given facts that do not need to be investigated further. In L√∂w‚Äôs approach, however, the city itself becomes the object of investigation. Present research focuses on the ongoing re-figuration of spaces. L√∂w‚Äôs inquiries are based on the theory that nowadays the constitution of space is increasingly polycontexturally structured, which implies that multiple spatial orderings are more and more frequently effective at the same time in our actions and interactions. Along with J√∂rg Stollmann she is currently heading the research project on Smart Cities: Everyday life in digitized environments as part of the Collaborative Research Centre SFB 1265 ‚ÄúThe Re-Figuration of Spaces‚Äù.

The Unseen) is a 1955 independently made American black-and-white science fiction film, produced and directed by David Kramarsky, that stars Paul Birch, Lorna Thayer, and Dona Cole. Some film sources have said that the film was co-directed by Lou Place. The film was co- produced by Roger Corman and Samuel Z. Arkoff.Lentz 1983, pp. 608, 629. and was released by American Releasing Corporation, which later became American International Pictures. The film's storyline concerns a space alien that is able to see through the eyes of a large array of Earth life that it can also mentally control, part of its plan to conquer the Earth. Plot The isolated Kelley family struggle to survive on their small date ranch, located in a bleak desert landscape well away from civilization. After a mysterious object crashes nearby, both wild and domesticated animals, and finally the farm's handyman, turn on the family, attacking them. It is finally revealed that a space alien (the \\"beast\\" of the title) has taken total control of the area's lesser animals and is working its way up to humans, all part of its master plan to conquer the Earth. In the end the family bond together, fighting against the alien menace, finally thwarting its plan of conquest.

Roger Corman was attracted to the project because in the original draft of the script, no monster was seen, which meant the film could be done cheaply.Palmer p 20 In April 1955 it was announced in Variety the film would be the first for Pacemaker Productions, a new company formed by Roger Corman. By that stage the film had been renamed The Beast with a Million Eyes. It would be produced and directed by David Kamarsky, Corman's former aide, while Corman would executive produce. Corman was meant to direct Cobra in India instead (that film was never made). Paul Birch's casting was announced in April 1955.War Buddies Alex Nicol, Mickey Knox to Costar; Kennedy to Stage-Direct Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 13 Apr 1955: B11. The Beast with a Million Eyes was the third of a three-picture deal Roger Corman had with the American Releasing Company following The Fast and the Furious (1955) and Five Guns West (1955).Smith 2014, pp. 18‚Äì19. Reportedly, cost over- runs on Five Guns West meant only $29,000 remained to make the film for Pacemaker Productions. Palmer p 19 The title Beast with a Million Eyes reportedly came from American Releasing Company president James H. Nicholson. His title and treatment had film exhibitors signed on before seeing the finished film. Reportedly The Beast with a Million Eyes was a non-union filming of a script originally titled The Unseen, with Lou Place set to direct. After one day's filming, the union threatened to shut down the production unless everyone signed with the Guild. Roger Corman, who was producing, took over the film's directing chores and replaced the cinematographer with Floyd Crosby; however Corman took no official screen credit. Another version of this story has Corman allocating directing duties to Dave Kramarsky, his associate director on Five Guns West. Filming took place in Indio and the Coachella Valley, California. Corman shot 48 pages of interiors in just two days at a studio on La Cienega Blvd. in Los Angeles. =Paul Blaisdell= When the company vice-president Samuel Z. Arkoff received The Beast with a Million Eyes he was unhappy that it did not even feature \\"the beast\\" that was implicit in the title. Paul Blaisdell, responsible for the film's special effects, was hired to create a three-foot-tall spaceship (with \\"beast\\" alien) for a meager $200. Notably, the Art Director was Albert S. Ruddy, who would later win two \\"Best Picture\\" Academy Awards for The Godfather (1972) and Million Dollar Baby (2004).Smith 2009, p. 21. It was Blaisdell's first monster made for the movies. He later said: > The creature seen in the last reel... was actually the slave of The Beast, > which had no physical being. It used a being from another star system to > pilot its ship, but that fact doesn't come across very well in the script. > The creature was an automaton and he was quite capable of doing a lot more > than he was allowed to do in the film. He was about eighteen inches high - > built to the same scale as King Kong. Unfortunately, all of his scenes were > shot in about ten minutes, with the wrong camera angles and everything. But > it's just one of those things which happens on a low-budget picture. According to Alex Gordon, when the film was first shown, Joseph E. Levine, then a distributor, offered Nicholson $100,000 to junk the movie and make a new one more in line with the advertising campaign. Gordon says James Nicholson spent two weeks analyzing the film and scratching over the negative to make it seem like lightning strikes to add to the dramatic qualities of the film. =Music= The tiny budget meant music in The Beast with a Million Eyes, credited to \\"John Bickford\\", is actually a collection of public-domain record library cues by classical composers Richard Wagner, Dimitri Shostakovich, Giuseppe Verdi, Sergei Prokofiev, and others, used to defray the cost of an original score or copyrighted cues.\\"Movieland events; Gig Young obtains 'A Man in Eritrea'.\\" Los Angeles Times, April 6, 1955, p. B6. Reception Film historian Leonard Maltin called The Beast with a Million Eyes, \\"Imaginative though poorly executed sci-fi melodrama with desert setting; a group of people is forced to confront an alien that can control an unlimited number of animals, hence the title.\\" He further described the film as, \\"(an) early Roger Corman production (that) features Paul Blaisdell's first movie monster.\\"Maltin, Leonard. \\"Leonard Maltin Movie Review.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Original site  The oldest historical record of a building at the location of the current castle dates to 1391. In that year, the De Haar family received the castle and the surrounding lands as a fiefdom from Hendrik van Woerden. The castle remained in the ownership of the De Haar family until 1440, when the last male heir died childless. The castle then passed to the Van Zuylen family. In 1482, the castle was burned down and the walls were destroyed, except for the parts that did not have a military function. These parts probably were incorporated into the castle when it was rebuilt during the early 16th century. The castle is mentioned in an inventory of the possessions of Steven van Zuylen from 1506, and again in a list of fiefdoms in the province Utrecht from 1536. The oldest image of the castle dates to 1554 and shows that the castle had been largely rebuilt by then. After 1641, when Johan van Zuylen van de Haar died childless, the castle seems to have gradually fallen into ruins. The castle escaped total destruction by the French during the Rampjaar 1672. In 1801 the last Catholic van Zuylen in the Netherlands, the bachelor Anton-Martinus van Zuylen van Nijevelt (1708‚Äì1801), bequeathed the property to his cousin Jean-Jacques van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1752‚Äì1846) of the Catholic branch in the Southern Netherlands.  1892 restoration  In 1887, Jean-Jacques' grandson, Etienne Gustave Fr√©d√©ric Baron van Zuylen van Nyevelt van de Haar (1860‚Äì1934), married Baroness H√©l√®ne de Rothschild, of the Rothschild family. When Etienne inherited the ruined castle in 1890 from his grandfather, the couple set about rebuilding the castle, fully financed by H√©l√®ne's family.Kasteeldehaar.nl For the restoration of the castle, they contracted famous architect Pierre Cuypers. He would work on this project for 20 years (from 1892 to 1912). The castle has 200 rooms and 30 bathrooms, of which only a small number on the ground floor have been opened to be viewed by the public. Cuypers placed a statue of himself in a corner of the gallery on the first floor. The castle was equipped by Cuypers with the most modern gadgets, such as electrical lighting with its own generator, and central heating by way of steam. This installation is internationally recognized as an industrial monument. The kitchen was for that period also very modern and still has a large collection of copper pots and pans and an enormous furnace approximately 6 metres long, which is heated with peat or coals. The tiles in the kitchen are decorated with the coats of arms of the families De Haar and Van Zuylen, which were for this purpose especially baked in Franeker. Cuypers emphasized the difference between the old and new walls by using different kinds of bricks. For the interior Cuypers made extensive use of cast iron. Many details in the castle refer to the Rothschild family, such as the Stars of David on the balconies of the knight's hall, the motto of the family on the hearth in the knight's hall (A majoribus et virtute) and the coat of arms of the family right underneath on the hearth in the library.  Interior  Interior of the main hall The interior of the castle is decorated with richly ornamented woodcarving, reminiscent of the interior of a Roman Catholic church. This carving was made in the workshop of Cuypers in Roermond, who even designed the tableware. The interior is furnished with many works from the Rothschild collections, including beautiful old porcelain from Japan and China, and several old Flemish tapestries and paintings with religious illustrations. The centrepiece is a carrier coach of the wife of a Japanese sh≈çgun, which reportedly is only one of two worldwide, the other one being exhibit in Tokyo. Japanese tourists come to De Haar to admire this coach, which was donated from the Rothschilds' collections.  Park and gardens  The castle seen from the air Surrounding the castle there is a park, designed by , for which Van Zuylen ordered 7,000 grown trees. Because these could not be transported through the city of Utrecht, Van Zuylen bought a house and demolished it. The park contains many waterworks and a formal garden reminiscent of the French gardens of Versailles. During the Second World War many of the gardens were lost, because the wood was used to light fires, and the soil was used to grow vegetables. Today most are restored to their original state. For the decoration of the park, the village Haarzuilens, except for the town church, was demolished. The inhabitants were moved to a place a kilometre away, where a new Haarzuilens arose and where they lived as tenants of the lord of the castle. This new village was also built in a pseudo-medieval style, including a rural village green. The buildings were for the most part designed by Cuypers and his son Joseph Cuypers. Since 2000, the estate is partly owned by Natuurmonumenten. Arms The colours of the family Van Zuylen are red and white. The coat of arms consists of three red columns on a white field. The different branches of this family differ slightly on these colours. This coat of arms does not only live on in the colours of the castle, but also in nearly all of the houses of Haarzuilens, even in the newly constructed ones.  Current ownership  In 2000, the family Van Zuylen van Nyevelt passed ownership of the castle and the gardens (45 ha) to the foundation Kasteel de Haar. However, the family retained the right to spend one month per year in the castle. In the same year, the Dutch society Natuurmonumenten bought the surrounding estate of 400 ha. An extensive restoration programme of the castle and the gardens was initiated in 2001 and was completed in 2011. After the death in 2011 of the last male heir, Thierry van Zuylen, his daughters also sold the castle's art collection and furnishings to the new owners.  Fairs  The castle terrain is regularly used for fairs and markets, such as the Elf Fantasy Fair.

As a scholar he is best known for The Dialect of the Gypsies of Wales (1926), an authoritative grammar of the Welsh-Romany language. Early life He was born in Schull, County Cork, Ireland, the son of James Sampson (1813-c. 1871), a chemist and engineer, and his wife Sarah Anne Macdermott; he was brother to Ralph Allen Sampson. James Sampson left Ireland after losing all his money in a bank failure. The family with four sons moved to Liverpool in 1871. John Sampson, the eldest, left school at the age of 14, after his father's death, and was apprenticed to the engraver and lithographer Alexander MacGregor. MacGregor retired when Sampson was aged 22, and from 1888 he ran his own printing business, in Liverpool's Corn Exchange. Sampson became librarian at University College, Liverpool in 1892, largely self-taught. His printing business had failed that year, and his application was supported by Kuno Meyer. In 1894, on a camping trip with others from the College, he encountered the musician Edward Wood, near Bala. The Wood family to which he belonged, descendants of Abram Wood (died 1799), were noted as speakers of Welsh-Romani, a quite pure inflected Romani dialect, which was to become Sampson's major study, and which earned him the sobriquet Romano rai (\\"Romany Rye\\", Gypsy scholar), or just \\"the Rai\\". They were also musicians, twenty-six harpists being noted from the 18th century. In 1896, through Lloyd Roberts, a harpist and Edward Wood's brother-in-law, Sampson found Matthew Wood, on Cader Idris, who moved shortly to Abergynolwyn. He was brother to Edward, and with his four sons more fluent in Welsh Romani, in which they told folk tales. Sampson spent vacations with them, and began a thirty-year lexicographical and philological project on the language. Matthew Wood, however, abruptly disappeared some three years later. In 1901 Sampson met the artist Augustus John, who was teaching in an art school connected with University College. They struck up a long friendship, leading to an emphasis in John's works on Romani subjects.Michael Holroyd, Augustus John (1996 single-volume edition), p. 100. At this period Sampson also knew the Polish painter Albert Lipczy≈Ñski, who was in Liverpool with an introduction to John; Sampson found him an interpreter, \\"Doonie\\", who became his wife. Researcher with assistants In the work of compiling The Dialect of the Gypsies of Wales, Sampson had assistants, notably Dora Esther Yates, who resisted his advances but found him intriguing. Other followers were Gladys Imlach, Eileen Lyster and Agnes Marston. Yates was in revolt against a strict family background, and recalled as comic the occasion when she and Marston were sent in 1906 to research the language of some German Roma in Blackpool. They returned late to family homes, both to find they had been locked out. Yates and Marston were sent in 1907 to find the burial place of Abram Wood, which they did, at Llangelynnin; Lyster later confirmed it, with a 1799 register entry. Yates and Marston were also successful in tracking down Matthew Wood, Sampson's important Welsh Romani source who had then been out of contact for nine years, at Betws Gwerfil Goch in 1908. Later life, death and funeral Sampson separated from his wife Margaret in 1920. In the intermittent history of the Gypsy Lore Society, Dora Yates supported its revival in 1922 (the Society had ceased to function during World War I, after Robert Andrew Scott Macfie had set it up again around 1906 and Sampson's presidency of 1915), and became its secretary in 1932. Sampson retired as librarian in 1928, and died at West Kirby, Cheshire on 9 November 1931. His funeral was non-religious with Romani elements, and his ashes were scattered on Foel-goch. Macfie and Yates were Sampson's executors, with Yates becoming the keeper of his literary estate. It was Yates who organised Sampson's funeral that took place on 21 November 1931 at Llangwm, west of Corwen and north of Bala. At Margaret Sampson's request, women (other than Yates) were excluded. Augustus John was there, Michael Sampson for the immediate family, and Roma including Ithal Lee and musicians. The event had extensive national newspaper coverage. Scholar While still a printer, Sampson investigated Shelta, a language used in the United Kingdom and United States with Irish origins. His work in this area was eventually published in 1937, by R. A. Stewart Macalister. An early work on the Roma was \\"English Gypsy Songs and Rhymes\\", containing eighteen Anglo-Romani pieces. It was published in 1891, in the Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society.Michael Yates and Steve Roud, Alice E. Gillington: Dweller on the Roughs, Folk Music Journal Vol. 9, No. 1 (2006), pp. 72‚Äì94, at p. 73. Published by: English Folk Dance + Song Society Sampson edited a collection of the poetry of William Blake, Blake's \\"Poetical Works\\" (1905),Sampson, J. The Poetical Works of William Blake; a new and verbatim text from the manuscript engraved and letterpress originals (1905), OUP. that restored the text from original works and annotated the published variants; Alfred Kazin described this as \\"the first accurate and completely trustworthy edition\\".Kazin, A. The Portable Blake, 1945, \\"Blake Chronology\\". The 1913 edition published for the first time Blake's poem The French Revolution. As a reviser, Sampson was involved in Geoffrey Keynes's 1921 Blake bibliography. They met for the first time in Liverpool, in 1910. The University of Oxford awarded Sampson an honorary degree in 1909. It was a D.Litt., and recognised both his linguistic studies and his work as a literary scholar. The Dialect of the Gypsies of Wales (1926) was Sampson's major work. It was started with the collaboration of Edward Wood, who died in 1902. Family Sampson married in 1894 (Jessie) Margaret Sprunt (1871‚Äì1947). The match was against the wishes of her father David Sprunt, and took place in secret at the Church of St Luke, Liverpool. They had two sons, Michael, and Amyas, who was killed fighting in World War I, and a daughter Honor. Sampson also had a daughter with his research assistant Gladys Imlach (d. 1931). From about 1909 he led a double life, with Margaret, Amyas, and Honor living in a cottage rented at Betws Gwerfil Goch in north Wales, and with Gladys, a relationship that was covert in his lifetime. Michael Sampson was the father of the writer Anthony Sampson, who published a biography of John Sampson, The Scholar Gypsy: The Quest For A Family Secret (1997).John Thompson, \\"Anthony Sampson\\" (obituary), The Guardian, 21 December 2004.

In rugby union, a drop kick is used for the kick-off and restarts and to score a field or drop goal. Originally it was one of only two ways to score points, along with the place kick. Drop kicks are mandatory: *from the centre spot to start a half (a kick-off) *from the centre spot to restart the game after points have been scored *to restart play from the 22-metre line (called a drop-out) after the ball is touched down or made dead in the in-goal area by the defending team when the attacking team kicked or took the ball into the in- goal area *to score a field goal or drop goal (or dropped goal) in open play, which is worth three points. Drop kicks are optional: *for a conversion kick after a try has been scored, but this is rare, as place kicks are generally used for the conversion *for a penalty kick to score a penalty goal, but this is rare, as place kicks are generally used *when kicking for touch (the sideline) from a penalty, although the option of a punt kick is usually taken instead. Additionally, in rugby sevens, the drop kick is used for all conversion attempts which must be taken within 40 seconds of the try being scored. Technique The drop kick technique in rugby union is to hold the ball with one end pointing downwards in two hands above the kicking leg, and the fingers pointing to the ground. The ball is dropped onto the ground in front of the kicking foot, which makes contact at the moment or fractionally after the ball touches the ground, called the half-volley. The kicking foot usually makes contact with the ball slightly on the instep.\\"Kicking: The Drop Kick\\" at www.coachingrugby.com. Retrieved 11 October 2007. In a rugby union kick-off or drop out, the kicker usually aims to kick the ball very high but not a great distance, and so usually strikes the ball after it has started to bounce upwards off the ground, so the contact is made close to the bottom of the ball. For the tactics of the drop goal in open play (field goal), see drop goal.

Distribution  = Indigenous distribution = Elimia virginica is native to the United States east of the continental divide. The species occurs in large Atlantic coast rivers in eastern North America, from Massachusetts to Virginia.Pennak, R. 1989. Fresh-water Invertebrates of the United States, 3rd ed. Protozoa to Mollusca. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, New York State. 628 pp. The northeastern limit of the native range of the species is the lower Connecticut River. The distribution of this species is shrinking in the native Connecticut River, and it is considered rare in Connecticut. Its conservation status in the Connecticut River Watershed is W1 (\\"a rare species, with 20 or fewer known occurrences in the watershed states\\").Watershed Rarity Ranks For Species Of Special Emphasis. Accessed 6 November 2008. The conservation status of Elimia virginica according to NatureServe, is as follows:Elimia virginica at NatureServe Exloprer , accessed November 2008. * United States of America ‚Äì secure. ** Massachusetts ‚Äì presumed extirpated. ** Connecticut ‚Äì critically imperiled. ** New York ‚Äì vulnerable. ** New Jersey ‚Äì unranked. ** Pennsylvania ‚Äì secure. ** Virginia ‚Äì apparently secure. ** North Carolina ‚Äì unrankable. = Nonindigenous distribution = The nonindigenous distribution of Elimia virginica includes another area in the United States: it migrated from the Atlantic drainage through the Erie Canal to the Lake Ontario drainage. The first record of this species in the Great Lakes drainage dates from around 1856-1860, when it was found in the Erie Canal near Mohawk, New York State. Populations later increased throughout the canal in the late 19th century, and reached Buffalo, at the mouth of Lake Erie. In the 1960s, this species was recorded from Oneida Lake in New York State. This species is considered established in the Lake Ontario drainage. However, this species, although introduced to the Lake Ontario drainage, has been largely out-competed by another introduced snail, this one from the Palaearctic ecozone, Bithynia tentaculata. Thus Elimia virginica is now virtually absent from the Oswego drainage, and is possibly very reduced in abundance in other localities where it was introduced, due to such interspecific competition. There are currently no known impacts caused by introduction of this species to other water bodies.  Shell description  Elimia virginica shells Elimia virginica belongs to the family Pleuroceridae, a group of snails that have thick, elongated shells. The operculum in this species is proteinaceous, corneous, and paucispiral and is withdrawn when the snail is active. The shells are dextral and have a very high and narrow spire, with little space in the suture (the incisions between the whorls). This species has two distinct shell morphologies, one smooth and one lirate (i.e. finely lined or grooved). Specimens of this species often vary in coloration: in general, Elimia virginica is yellow to chestnut in hue, but it sometimes has 2 darker brown spiral bands.Peckarsky, B. L., P. R. Fraissinet, M. A. Penton and D. J. Conklin Jr. 1993. Freshwater Macroinvertebrates of Northeastern North America. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York State. 442 pp. Juveniles (snails with an aperture height of no more than 7 mm) display the banding more frequently than adults. The shells of specimens of Elimia virginica from New York State and the Connecticut River range from 27 to 33 mm high, with an aperture height of 9‚Äì12 mm.  Anatomy  It is easy to distinguish the female of this species in whole animals, because of the presence of the external genital sinus. In 2008. four nucleotide sequences and one protein sequence of Elimia virginica were determined.Elimia virginica. NCBI taxonomy database. Accessed 6 November 2008.  Ecology  = Habitat = Elimia virginica is found in freshwater rivers and streams with cobble bottoms and boulders. (Pleurocerids are usually found in lotic erosional environments, in riffles or shoals with rock or sand substrate, and especially frequently on rocks in slower areas of medium size reaches.) Elimia virginica usually inhabits slow to medium velocity rivers and streams with firm and clean gravel, cobble and rock substrate. Pleurocerids in general are sensitive to abiotic stresses, and Elimia virginica is not tolerant to siltation. In Connecticut, Elimia virginica is at the edge of its range, and is most likely limited to hard water habitats only.Jokinen, E. H. and J. Pondick. 1981. Rare and endangered species: freshwater gastropods of southern New England. The Bulletin of the American Malacological Union, Inc. 50:52‚Äì53. During collections made in the Connecticut River, the snail was found to inhabit regions with water temperatures up to 27.5 ¬∞C, dissolved oxygen between 7 and 14 ppm, CaCO3 concentration from 42‚Äì160 ppm, pH from 7.6‚Äì9.0 and CO2 concentration from 0‚Äì10 ppm. However, at some of these sites, population abundance was very low and/or decreasing, especially in conditions of high water temperature and alkalinity. = Life cycle = Elimia virginica is dioecious. It lays its eggs from spring to summer, in particular in June and July. This species, unlike softer shelled physid snails, grows very slowly, and has the lowest intrinsic rate of increase (this means that populations grow very slowly), along with Leptoxis carinata, in this environment.Hamilton, S. 1980. Reproduction or shell armor ‚Äì a trade off in freshwater gastropods. The Bulletin of the American Malacological Union, Inc. 46:71. Individuals of this species are often sexually mature within one year; and can live 5 years. = Feeding habits = Elimia virginica is grazer of epilithic periphyton.Rob Dillon (ed.). Goniobasis virginica , Freshwater Gastropods of North America , accessed 30 October 2008. = Parasites = Trematodes are often parasitic in reproductive organs of this species. Parasites of Elimia virginica include trematode Aspidogaster conchicola. = Other interspecific relationships = In the Connecticut River, the shell of Elimia virginica is often used as substrate by epizootic algae and the entoproct Urnatella gracilis. A short study in the Potomac River, Virginia, found that the snail has a very strong shell that is adapted to withstand predation by such predators as crayfish and ducks. However, there is an evolutionary trade-off between predator defense and rapid growth and reproduction amongst snail populations found in this river. There is recent evidence for hybridisation (the process of creating intermediate forms called hybrids during interspecific breeding) and introgression between Elimia virginica and Elimia livescens amongst populations brought into contact due to the opening of the Erie Canal.Bianchi, T. S., G. M. Davis and D. Strayer. 1994. An apparent hybrid zone between freshwater gastropod species Elimia livescens and E. virginica (Gastropoda: Pleuroceridae). American Malacological Bulletin 11(1):73-78. These two species were formerly completely geographically isolated during glaciation by the Alleghenian Divide: the former was only found in Atlantic Slope drainages, while the latter was only found in Interior Basin drainages. Hybridization and introgression of this kind can put the genetic integrity of a species at severe risk, especially when the population is already small.

After retiring from the Navy, he briefly tenured as the Pakistan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 2001‚Äì2005 and later becoming the CEO of The Centaurus in Islamabad. During his military service in the Navy, Admiral Mirza is given credit for commissioning the country's first ingeniously and locally built long-range submarine, the Agosta 90B submarine in 1999. Biography =Early life and naval career= Abdul Aziz Mirza was born in small town, Dhamali Kallar Syedan, in Rawalpindi, Punjab, British India, in 1943. He was born into an influential military family, and his father briefly enlisted in the British Indian Army, retiring as chief warrant officer (CWO) in the Frontier Force Regiment of the Pakistan Army. After his graduation from local high school, he went to attend the Military College Jhelum and secured his graduation before joining the Pakistan Navy in 1961. After graduation, Mirza applied for the Pakistan Military Academy and was selected with Pervez Musharraf and PQ Mehdi for the interview by the commandants in 1961. After passing the physical, he was studied at the Pakistan Military Academy with Pervez Musharraf who remained his life-long friend and Ali Kuli Khan. He was later sent to attend the Naval Academy in Turkey where he was trained for his basic training and gained military commission as Sub-Lieutenant in the Naval Operations Branch in the Navy in 1961. He was trained as a surface warfare officer and took participation in second war with India in 1965 against the Indian Navy as a gunnery specialist. In the war of 1965 he served in PNS Dhaka. In 1969‚Äì71, Lt. Mirza served in the Submarine Command before reporting at the Naval Base Iqbal where he underwent in training as a military diver and war specialist in the Navy SEALs Teams of the Special Services Group of the Navy, later serving in the Eastern Pakistan where he participating in counter-insurgency operations before being assigned at the Submarine Command. After the war, he began engage with his studies and went to join the French War College where he graduated with a Master's degree in War studies. In 1980s, he served on the faculty at the Naval War College in Karachi and taught English at the Naval Academy, also in Karachi. =Staff and Command appointments= Throughout his career in Navy, Mirza commanded two submarines‚Äì the Daphn√© and Agosta 70. Mirza also commanded the guided missile destroyer and a fleet of tankers as an officer in the Navy. In 1990, he was posted at the Navy NHQ as a Naval Secretary, and held officer commanding assignments, first serving as the Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) of the 25th Destroyer Squadron as Commodore in 1993. In 1994, he was promoted as Rear- Admiral and made Additional Secretary at the Ministry of Defence, working on various defence and procurement programmes. In 1994, he led series of complicated and lengthy negotiations, together with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, with France over the technology transfer of Agosta 90B class long- range submarines. It was during this time, he became closer to many politicians and bureaucrats while working on the procurement deals in 1994‚Äì97. In 1997, he was appointed as DCNS (Operations) and elevated as Vice Chief of Naval Staff with a rank of Vice-Admiral. =Kargil war and Naval chief= In 1999, India and Pakistan engaged in military confrontation in Kargil sector, due a misadventure led by then-Chief of army staff General Pervez Musharraf. He did not endorsed the secret infiltration to support General Pervez Musharraf but rather remaining quiet in favor of army chief. Allegations have been levelled against him of misguiding the naval chief Admiral Fasih Bokhari on the matters of Kargil war in favor of army chief, and his revolt against the decision of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif over the appointment of Chairman joint chiefs. In 1999, he held a press conference together with Mushahid Hussain Syed, then-Information Minister, and ultimately warned India of escalating the tensions in the region. On 6 October 1999, he was promoted as four-star rank admiral and appointed Chief of Naval Staff after Admiral Bokharhi prematurely resigned from his commission in protest as the latter was denied the Chairmanship of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. Admiral Mirza remained supportive of martial law in 1999, and was said to be closer to Chairman joint chiefs and chief of army staff General Pervez Musharraf. Two weeks later, he was inducted as a senior member in the National Security Council alongside with Chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal PQ Mehdi. On 4 November 1999, Admiral Mirza released a report of his assets, with General Musharraf also releasing his tax returns papers. In 2000, Admiral Mirza notably announced of seeling the Agosta-90B Subamrines to Royal Saudi Navy and Royal Malaysian Navy but the agreement to sell the submarines were never materialized as Pakistan imposed an export restrictions. In 2001, he questioned President Musharraf's decision policy towards the terrorism and military rotation in Western Pakistan, but he was reportedly warned by President Musharraf on his difference of opinion. He reportedly warned of expansion of Indian Navy and noted that the Indian Navy‚Äôs budget had increased 6,900% since 1971. He led the Pakistan Navy during the military standoff between India and Pakistan in 2001‚Äì02 and boldly stated that Pakistan Navy will hold its own against the Indian Navy. As the naval chief, he is credit of overseeing the development and nationwide construction of the Agosta-90B Khalid-class submarines in various capacities as Pakistan built its first indigenous submarine in 2002.\\"Pakistan launches its Agosta submarine\\" Express India, 24 August 2002. Diplomatic and corporate career Admiral Mirza retired from the Navy as its naval chief on 4 October 2002, and handed over the command to Admiral Shahid Karimullah at the ceremony held in Navy NHQ. On 8 October 2002, President Musharraf announced to appointed Admiral Mirza for a diplomatic post and appointed him as Pakistan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. In 2005, he oversaw the process of paperworks in order to release the passport of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family to travel from Jeddah to London. In 2004, Ambassador Mirza was honored and decorated with the Legion of Honour with an order of Chevalier by the French government; the honor was bestowed to him in Saudi Arabia by the French Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Bernard Polleti. The honor was given in recognition of outstanding contributions to a Pakistani-French joint submarine building program while the ambassador was chief of naval staff of the Pakistan Navy. As an ambassador, Mirza worked towards strengthening the relationship between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia as he focused towards trade agreements and defence cooperation between two countries. On 26 January 2006, Mirza left the diplomat post and returned to Pakistan as he was replaced by Admiral Shahid Karimullah who took over the diplomatic assignment from him in Riyadh. After his retirement from the diplomatic post, Mirza jointed the corporate sector of the country when he was appointed business adviser to the PakGulf Construction in 2007. On 14 January 2010, Admiral Mirza gives credence to the recent French investigative report that talked of almost $49 million kickbacks in the Agosta-submarine deal allegedly received by former President Asif Ali Zardari, former Chief of Naval Staff Admiral (deposed) Mansurul Haq and some of the Naval officers, disclosing that the then Benazir government had urged the Pakistan Navy to go for the French subs.Ex-Navy chief confirms Zardari French kickbacks Currently, Mirza is CEO of The Centaurus in Islamabad, overseeing and managing the construction project of a contemporary modern, luxurious master-planned community that integrates residential amenities with a world class shopping mall, a 5-star hotel, corporate and entertainment facilities.

G√©rard Dalmon (b. 1945), a computer consultant at Cap Gemini, and Pierre Staudenmeyer (1952‚Äî2007), a marketing consultant, established the Galerie N√©ot√π in 1984 in Paris, France, on the rue de Verneuil, then in 1985 on the rue du Renard. Galerie N√©ot√π sold contemporary furniture and other items by primarily French designers, artists, and architects. The items were produced in limited editions, some unique. The gallery assisted with production and was instrumental in establishing some of the young, essentially unknown French designers of the 1980s and 1990s, who have since become members of the current who's who of French and international design. The enterprise pursued an approach to design, which was in the trend of the time, and focused on designers whose work was known as art furniture.

During his episcopacy, he oversaw an increase in lay ministry within the diocese, but also increased the number of clergy, and improved the diocese's financial position. The period also saw the creation of the Nine O'Clock Service within one of the diocese's churches. Initially this seemed to be a successful attempt to broaden the appeal of the church, but in the end the project collapsed, and required strong leadership from Lunn to heal the resulting wounds. Following the Hillsborough Disaster, he implemented the clergy disaster plan to improve the church's response to such disasters in future.

He is the host and music director of the public radio programs Exploring Music and Saint Paul Sunday. A nationally noted radio commentator since 1981, Bill McGlaughlin is known for his cheerful, open, and down-to-earth personality on classical music radio.Phillips, Lisa. Public Radio: Behind the Voices. Vanguard Press, 2006. p. 313. Beyond his career as a broadcaster and music educator, McGlaughlin has also spent a decade as a professional orchestral musician, over three decades as a conductor, and a decade as a successful composer. He views the more recent, radio broadcast aspect of his musical career as outreach ‚Äî as a way to keep classical music from becoming an increasingly marginalized art form, with ever-smaller and older audiences.Phillips, Lisa. Public Radio: Behind the Voices. Vanguard Press, 2006. p. 317. Early life McGlaughlin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his unusual accent stems from his Philadelphia childhood and the influence of his Scottish-American grandfather, with whom he lived during his early childhood and late teens. Bill absorbed the music of opera at a very young age, as his draftsman father listened while in his at-home workshop. When Bill was 6, his father gave him a harmonica, and together they enjoyed playing their favorite opera melodies by ear.Phillips, 2006. pp. 314‚Äì315.Family of origin : Mother: Catharine Hogan McGlaughlin; father: William McGlaughlin, Sr.; Scottish grandfather: John Hogan. Bill is the oldest of six siblings. His father also had many instrumental classical albums, which Bill enjoyed listening to in his own bedroom.Exploring Music, episode April 21, 2008, \\"Tchaikovsky, Part II.\\" Bill's mother, a high-school English teacher, was also a music lover.\\"Music is to me, my sister, and was to my mother, a great human need. Even in these difficult times there are spiritual needs, and music is one of them. It's not a question of do we or don't we ‚Äî we have to have quality music in Kansas City.\\" Bill McGlaughlin, quoted in: Schondelmeyer, Brent. Building a First Class Bank: The Story of United Missouri Bank. United Missouri Bancshares, 1986. p. 119. At the age of 14, McGlaughlin received his first piano lesson, quite by accident ‚Äî his younger brother had been taking a series of pre-paid piano lessons but abruptly quit, so Bill was given the remainder. By his second lesson, he knew he wanted to be a professional musician, and began practicing eight hours a day.Strauss, Elaine. \\"Exploring & Celebrating the Uncommon Music\\". U.S. 1. June 3, 2009. Musical career =Performing= In high school, McGlaughlin took up the trombone, which he further studied in college, obtaining his Bachelor of Music degree from Philadelphia's Temple University in 1967. Upon graduation in 1967 he became Assistant Principal Trombonist of the Philadelphia Orchestra, a position he held through 1968. From 1969 to 1975 he was Co-Principal Trombonist of the Pittsburgh Symphony. In addition, during these years in Pennsylvania, McGlaughlin performed in groups such as the Pittsburgh Symphony Players, which he founded in 1973,Jaques Cattell Press, ed. Who's Who in American Music: Classical. R. R. Bowker, 1983. p. 276Randel, Don Michael, ed. The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music. Harvard University Press, 1996. p. 533 the Penn Contemporary Players, and the Philadelphia Composers Forum. He also performed as trombonist during many of his 1975‚Äì1982 years with the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. =Conducting= Orchestral performance sparked McGlaughlin's interest in conducting ‚Äî an interest which was encouraged by Pittsburgh Symphony's William Steinberg. In 1969 he completed a Master of Music degree in conducting at Temple University, studying under Robert Page; and in addition he received private instruction and tutelage from William R. Smith, Associate Conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and Max Rudolf.Cummings, David, ed. International Who's Who In Music and Musicians' Directory (in the Classical and Light Classical Fields). Routledge, 2000. p. 429Phillips, 2006. p. 316. McGlaughlin also became assistant conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Chamber Orchestra during his period with the Pittsburgh Symphony.Pan Pipes: Sigma Alpha Iota Quarterly, Volumes 81-82. Wayside Press, 1988. p. 12.Celebrate: The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. December 1979. p. 2. During his years as a trombonist after his master's degree, he brought a full orchestral score to rehearsals, taking careful notes on how good and poor conductors handled difficult passages. In 1973, he asked Georg Solti whether he should pursue a conducting career; Solti encouraged him, but insisted he needed an orchestra to practice with. McGlaughlin formed three orchestras in Pittsburgh that year ‚Äî an orchestra of college students, the Pittsburgh Camerata, and the Upper Partials Chamber Players. His practice paid off: In 1975, he was awarded the Exxon-Arts Conducting Endowment, and an assistant conductorship at the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra.Crafts, Fred. \\"Playing Wasn't Enough for St. Paul Conductor\\". Eugene Register-Guard. September 22, 1980.

International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, May 24, 1996. In addition, he received five ASCAP Adventurous Programming Awards for his continued performing of contemporary music, and for aiding Kansas City Symphony audiences in understanding the composers' intentions in these works. McGlaughlin has also continuously had numerous guest conducting engagements, from a great variety of orchestras around the U.S.Guest conducting engagements include: Baltimore Symphony, Denver Symphony, Houston Symphony, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Minnesota Orchestra, National Symphony, New Orleans Symphony, Oregon Symphony, Pacific Symphony, Pittsburgh Symphony, St. Louis Symphony, Opera Theatre St. Louis, American Music Theater Festival, and San Antonio Festival. Many of McGlaughlin's guest conducting engagements can also be viewed in the International Who's Who In Music and Musicians' Directory; and at . Additional conducting outreach includes guest conductor of the Platteville Chorale Summer Music Festival 1978‚Äì1988 , and the TMEA (Texas Music Educators Association) Symphony Orchestra in 2003 ; and Music Director of the Minnesota Youth Symphonies 1980‚Äì1981. =Composing= McGlaughlin was early on a champion of living composers and new music, dating back to his Pennsylvania days and his involvement with groups such as the Penn Contemporary Players and the Philadelphia Composers Forum. McGlaughlin himself founded the Pittsburgh Camerata (1973), which focused on contemporary music, and he was a steady proponent of living composers' works in Kansas City as well. Eventually, this championing became a desire to compose on his own. In 1998, he left his conducting position and moved to New York City to concentrate on composing. Prompted by the death of a friend who was a Kansas City pianist and composer, McGlaughlin's first major work was Three Dreams and a Question: Choral Songs on e.e. cummings ‚Äî which he debuted with the Kansas City Symphony on April 28, 1998, to an enthusiastic audience and press. Some of the other 20 works he created in his first decade of composing, most of them commissioned, include: Aaron's Horizons (a tribute to colleague Aaron Copland); Echoes, for horn trio; Angelus, a 9/11 remembrance; Three Pieces for Wind Trio; Bagatelles, for saxophone quartet; The Heart's Light: An Essay for Orchestra; Three by Six, for chamber ensemble; and The Bells of St. Ferdinand, for orchestra. For a millennial celebration, he was chosen from a field of 350 composers to write a major new work for Continental Harmony, a nationwide cultural initiative commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts and the American Composers Forum. The composition, Walt Whitman's Dream, premiered in July 2000, and celebrated the new millennium with a combined chorus of nearly 800 singers from around the world, accompanied by orchestra.Bill McGlaughlin and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra On December 15, 2005, the national two-hour daily NPR classical music radio program Performance Today announced that out of all of the music aired that week, McGlaughlin's new composition Remembering Icarus garnered the most, and the most heartfelt, listener response.Mail: Performance Today, December 15, 2005. The piece has been re-broadcast on radio three times. Discussing his own music, McGlaughlin describes his compositional style as more intuitive than intellectual,December 9, 2005 interview on Performance Today and says that he does not shun tonality: \\"I think when composers turn completely away from tonality, they lose a big part of storytelling.\\"Phillips, 2006. p. 319. Some of his work incorporates or references elements of jazz ‚Äî for instance Bela's Bounce, an homage to B√©la Bart√≥k and Charlie Parker. Radio career =Saint Paul Sunday= In the late 1970s, during his conducting stint in Saint Paul, Minnesota, McGlaughlin often spoke to the audience before a performance, informally explaining the program and what to listen for. Garrison Keillor heard him, and invited him to fill in occasionally as host of his daily morning radio show on Minnesota Public Radio (MPR).Bill McGlaughlin Interview . WCNY Blog. November 30, 2011. MPR producer Tom Voegeli came up with the idea for a new show: Saint Paul Sunday Morning, with McGlaughlin as host. MPR had just received a public radio communications satellite uplink, as well as seed money to develop a few pilot shows for national distribution. Voegeli wanted a program which would present world-class musicians, in an informal live setting in MPR's new state-of-the-art studio, to a national audience. Voegeli also wanted McGlaughlin to sound like himself ‚Äî a musician ‚Äî rather than like a broadcaster, and to share his own intimate, animated enthusiasm with listeners.Uslan, Rachel. \\"It Wouldn't Be a Sunday Without 'Saint Paul'\\". Los Angeles Times, March 2, 2001. p. F-26Phillips, 2006. pp. 316‚Äì317. The show, retitled Saint Paul Sunday, debuted locally in 1980, and went national via syndication in 1981. The weekly one-hour show, which aired through 2012, featured live in-studio performances by and interviews with the world's top classical musicians, both soloists and ensembles. It was America's most widely listened to weekly classical music program produced by public radio, and aired on approximately 200 stations nationwide. The show, with McGlaughlin as host and music director since its inception, was awarded the Peabody Award in 1995. McGlaughlin's enthusiasm for the show and the music was evident: \\"If I had been able to imagine Saint Paul Sunday as a kid,\\" he says, \\"I think I‚Äôd have been in ecstasy at the idea of having the whole wide world of music to run around in, and best of everything, to be able to bring friends along.\\" =Exploring Music= In 2002, Steve Robinson, Vice President of WFMT Radio Network, approached McGlaughlin to host a daily radio show, which would showcase and explicate great works of classical music.Manning, Bryant. \\"Bill‚Äôs Excellent Venture: Radio Host Brings Arias and Masses to the Masses.

Music Institute of Chicago 2008 Gala Exploring Music garnered McGlaughlin, as its host and music director, the Lifetime Achievement Award from Fine Arts Radio International in 2004, \\"because he has taken up the music education baton implicitly passed to him by the late Karl Haas, whose Adventures in Good Music has metamorphized into Exploring Music, with an ear tuned to the evolving trends of the 21st-century classical audience.\\" Fine Arts Radio International concluded by saying, \\"Exploring Music, with its weekly thematic concept, provides the classical radio listener with both in- depth education and compelling radio listening, a balance that is rarely achieved.\\"Fine Arts Radio International Awards: 2004 Lifetime Achievement Award In 2011, the Association of Music Personnel in Public Radio presented him with the AMPPR Lifetime Achievement Award, citing \\"McGlaughlin's incredibly knowledgeable but always inviting and warm presence with which he guides listeners to discover the heart, soul and humor of the music he plays.\\"\\"Bill McGlaughlin Receives Lifetime Achievement Award\\" . The Association of Music Personnel in Public Radio. May 30, 2011. =Additional media appearances= McGlaughlin has been the co-host of the nationally syndicated radio series Center Stage from Wolf Trap since its inception in 1999. He is also the host, since 2007, of the newly relaunched nationally syndicated radio series Concerts from the Library of Congress.\\"Concerts from the Library of Congress Radio Series To Launch on Nov. 5.\\" News from the Library of Congress; October 25, 2007 In addition to these and to Saint Paul Sunday and Exploring Music, since 1986 he has also hosted, and occasionally conducted, a number of radio and television programs on NPR, PRI, PBS, and the BBC, and on local NPR affiliates.McGlaughlin's radio and television engagements through 2003 are listed on: .

He also lectures at and hosts live concerts and concert series and other musical events around the country.Other concert lectures include: , , . Drawing upon his expertise as a conductor and his abilities as a music commentator, McGlaughlin contributed one of the ten chapters in the 2008 book, Leonard Bernstein: American Original.McGlaughlin, Bill. \\"On the Podium: Intellect and Energy.\\" In Leonard Bernstein: American Original, edited by Burton Bernstein and Barbara Haws, pp. 157‚Äì172. HarperCollins, 2008. Editor Barbara Haws describes McGlaughlin's chapter, \\"On the Podium: Intellect and Energy,\\" in her introduction to the book: :Bernstein's passion on the podium is perhaps the most indelible image he has left us. By evaluating Bernstein's marked conducting scores in the Philharmonic Archives and analyzing his televised performances, conductor, composer, and radio personality Bill McGlaughlin brings together the ephemeral with the workaday to understand better Bernstein's hold over the popular imagination and his remarkable rapport with musicians. Melding the flamboyant public display with the private meticulousness seen in the scores provides new insights, and confirms long- held assumptions about what Bernstein was hoping to achieve.Haws, Barbara.

It stars Liam Neeson, Christina Ricci, and Justin Long. Plot Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson) owns a funeral parlour and talks softly to the corpses he prepares for burial. Middle school teacher Anna Taylor (Christina Ricci) attends the funeral of her piano teacher where she meets Eliot. That night Anna argues with her boyfriend Paul (Justin Long) at a restaurant. She drives off in a state of distress, and has a traffic accident. She awakens on an exam table in the funeral parlour to find the funeral director, Eliot, cutting off her clothes and telling her she has died. He tells Anna he has a gift and that he can hear the dead. Eliot has a collection of photographs of corpses whom he has helped \\"make the transition\\". Eliot injects Anna regularly with a fictional drug called hydronium bromide to \\"relax the muscles and keep rigor mortis from setting in.\\" Paul asks to see Anna's body but Eliot does not allow it on the grounds he is not family. Anna unsuccessfully attempts to escape several times. Eliot tells her she must let go of life as she had not really been living anyway. Eventually, Anna escapes and finds a room with a phone where she reaches Paul, who hangs up thinking it's a prank. Anna comes to believe she has actually died when Eliot lets her see her corpse-like self in a mirror. One of Anna's students sees her and alerts Paul, who begins to suspect she is still alive. Anna's student visits the funeral parlour and Eliot tells him that they share a gift, the same as Jesus, who raised Lazarus, and he offers to teach the boy more. The boy accepts and is later seen burying a living chick in a box. During the final preparation for the funeral, Anna asks to see herself one last time. Eliot holds up a small mirror, and while she stares at herself she notices her breath condensing on the glass and accuses Eliot of having lied to her about her being dead. Eliot injects her one last time and she slips into unconsciousness. At the funeral, Paul places the engagement ring he intended to give her the night of the crash on her finger. After the funeral, Paul drinks heavily and behaves aggressively with Eliot, who seems to taunt him and encourage him to see for himself that Anna is really dead, telling him there is not much time. Meanwhile, Anna is shown awakening to the sound of earth being shoveled onto her coffin. She cries out and desperately scratches the satin lining of her coffin lid. Driving under the influence of alcohol, Paul rushes to the cemetery. They are shown embracing and Anna tells Paul she has always loved him. Paul asks what the odd sound is that he hears, and Anna explains it is the sound of Eliot's gloves and scissors on the table as he prepares Paul's body. A moment later, he finds himself in the funeral parlour with Eliot standing over him preparing his body as he did Anna's. Eliot tells him that he never made it to the cemetery due to a car accident which killed him. Paul protests that he is alive until the moment Eliot inserts a trocar deep into his torso.

The book is an epistolary novel, narrated in the first person via letters and diary extracts from various characters, but mainly Rupert. The initial sections, leading up to the reading of the uncle's will, told by other characters, suggest that Rupert is the black sheep of the family, and the conditions of having to live in the castle in the Blue Mountains for a year before he can permanently inherit the unexpectedly large million-pound estate suggest the uncle is somehow testing the heir. Plot summary Rupert Saint Leger inherits his uncle's estate worth more than one million pounds, on condition that he live for a year in his uncle's castle in the Land of the Blue Mountains on the Dalmatian coast. There Rupert tries to win the trust of the conservative mountaineer population by using his fortune to buy them modern arms (from a South American country that has unexpectedly found itself at peace) for their fight against Turkish invasion (the story was written shortly before the Balkan Wars). One wet night, he is visited in his room in the castle by a pale woman wearing a wet shroud, seeking warmth. He lets her dry herself before his fire, and she flees before morning. She visits several more times, all at night, and they hardly speak, but he falls in love with her, despite thinking she is a vampire. He visits the local church and finds her in a glass-topped stone coffin in the crypt. Despite misgivings he declares his love, be she living or undead, and she arranges the marriage in an Orthodox ceremony conducted by candlelight in the church one night, although he still does not know her name, and she says she must still live alone in the crypt for the present. Soon afterwards, she is kidnapped by a forward party of Turkish troops, and he learns that she, Teuta, is not undead, but the living daughter of the local Voivode, who is currently returning from a visit to America. She had fallen into a trance, and was declared dead, but then revived, and the local leaders and clergy spread a story of vampirism which was more acceptable than the truth to the uneducated locals, after the (mistaken) news of her death. Living up to this story, she had spent her days in the coffin in the crypt, but during heavy rain when the crypt flooded, came out seeking warmth in the castle in which she had grown up, and knew all the secret entrances, and hence her meetings with Rupert behind locked gates. Rupert leads a relief force which kills her kidnappers and rescues her. But news immediately arrives that the Voivode has just returned to the country only to be kidnapped by Turks himself. They race back to the coast, and Rupert unloads an aeroplane with a near-silent engine from the munitions ship which has also just arrived, along with sets of bullet-proof clothes. The kidnapped Voivode is tracked to a nearby castle ruin, and Rupert pilots the plane onto the castle wall as if it were a balloon or dirigible, and lowers Teuta by rope to her father. He dons a set of the bullet proof clothes which Teuta and Rupert are also wearing, and Rupert hauls both up to the aircraft which he silently flies off. The castle is then attacked by local troops and the Turks defeated. Teuta subsequently reveals her marriage to Rupert to her father, who welcomes him into the family and the country.

It is a daily, one-hour show with a single in-depth theme each week. The show, which debuted in 2003, is produced by WFMT Radio Network. Exploring Music is in many ways the heir to the late Karl Haas' popular long-running show, Adventures in Good Music, expanded and updated for a 21st-century audience.Williams, David. \\"'Exploring' Replaces 'Adventures': Bill McGlaughlin Takes a Deeper Look on Classical Music Radio Program.\\" Sunday Gazette-Mail, July 30, 2006Fine Arts Radio International Awards: 2004 Lifetime Achievement Award As of 2013, Exploring Music airs on 55 U.S. radio stations and has over 400,000 live listeners weekly.von Rhein, John. \\"McGlaughlin to be 'Exploring Music' Under the Stars Here.\\" Chicago Tribune, June 27, 2008; reprinted in Metromix Chicago.Music Institute of Chicago 2008 Awards.

The Classical Review. July 15, 2013. Program description Exploring Music delves into a wide variety of topics in classical music, and each five-program, one-week series has a single theme. Weekly themes have included weeklong studies of the music of dozens of composers, explorations of various cultures, styles, forms, and time periods, and dozens of other topics and areas of exploration. A very small sampling of weekly topics includes such themes as: { -valign=top  *Wagner's Ring Cycle *Piano Concertos *Music Inspired by Love *How Do We Get from Bach to Beethoven? *Variations *Music of Spain *Music Critics *La Belle Epoque *Old Wine in New Bottles  *Families of Instruments *Beethoven and that Danged Metronome *String Quartets *All in the Family: Musician Relatives *Shakespeare and Music *The Mighty Handful *Requiem Masses *Tone Poems *Literature Inspired by Classical Music } Beethoven themes have included: Late Beethoven, Beethoven and the Piano, Beethoven Quartets, and Beethoven and that Danged Metronome. Over two dozen classical composers ‚Äî e.g. Schumann, Bart√≥k, Grieg, Debussy, Vaughan Williams, Stravinsky, and Bernstein ‚Äî have also had weekly themes devoted exclusively to their lives and music. These programs are intimate biographies which include the composer's early life, education, historical and musical influences, personal life, and emotional and musical development, plus numerous musical pieces each day. Several composers, including Schubert, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mahler, Verdi, and Shostakovich, have had a two-week theme devoted to their lives and works. Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven have each had several series centered around their works. Approximately one week per month is devoted to the life and works of a single composer. Exploring Music is geared to all ages and to any level of musical knowledge. Host Bill McGlaughlin guides the listener into the music through various means: revealing the stories behind compositions, adding analysis and illustrations at the piano, exploring the interlocking nature of music and ideas, referencing the historical context of pieces and trends, and also giving his insight as a professional musician, conductor, and composer. Each week McGlaughlin weaves a deepening narrative around the topic at hand, and aims to make exploring classical music fun. \\"Drawing people inside the music seems the clue to me,\\" he says. \\"Human beings are wired for delight when we figure something out.\\"Burkholder, Steve. \\"Chicago Classical Music Chat with Bill McGlaughlin.\\" Chicago Classical Music. March 8, 2007 Occasionally music from other genres ‚Äî such as jazz, ethnic/world music, folk/traditional music, or pop standards ‚Äî is aired, to liven up the discussion and illustrate points. The piano is another tool McGlaughlin frequently employs to get concepts across. Of his original decisions about the show's format, McGlaughlin says, \\"It‚Äôs very hard to talk about music on the radio unless you can hear a sound, so I said I need a piano. Instead of saying 'a minor third,' I can play it. I wanted to make certain that what you could hear was prominent.\\" Inception and history In 2002, Steve Robinson, Vice President of WFMT Radio Network, approached Peabody Award-winner Bill McGlaughlin to host a new daily radio show, which would showcase and explicate great works of classical music.Manning, Bryant. \\"Bill‚Äôs Excellent Venture: Radio Host Brings Arias and Masses to the Masses.\\" Time Out Chicago. Issue 175: Jul 3‚Äì9, 2008 McGlaughlin had spent 22 years as host and music director of Saint Paul Sunday, the nationally syndicated weekly chamber music performance and interview show. His credentials also included decades as a professional musician, conductor, and composer. Regarding his choice of McGlaughlin as host, Steve Robinson stated, \\"As far as I'm concerned, no one can top Bill in the way he conveys his passion for music on the radio.\\" Development of the new program was funded by a special grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, in November 2002.Exploring Music Official Site ‚Äì Bill McGlaughlin The show debuted nationally on October 6, 2003. Exploring Music in essence replaced Karl Haas' long-running show, Adventures in Good Music, since the aging and retired Haas had recorded no new episodes of his show after 2002. When encore broadcasts of Adventures in Good Music ceased entirely on June 29, 2007, Exploring Music gained an even wider national listenership, as it was then scheduled in the retired show's time slot on many radio stations. In 2013, after repeated requests from listeners and following years of negotiation with recorded-music copyright lawyers, Exploring Music reached ground-breaking legal agreements which allow it to stream any of its past shows on demand from its site. Popular and critical reception Exploring Music has delved into Bach's Secular Works, his B-Minor Mass, his St. Matthew Passion, and, in December, his Christmas Oratorio. McGlaughlin's highly informed, yet relatable and enthusiastic presentation has appealed to radio audiences of all ages, including younger listeners.Robinson, Steve. \\"Drawing Kids to Classical.\\" Chicago Classical Music: BackStage Blog.

The letters range from a person who had never heard a string quartet before and wanted to know where to buy one, to a listener who graduated from Juilliard and found [Bill's] comments on Ravel to be enlightening! As of 2013, Exploring Music had over 400,000 listeners to the live show. =Honors= Host and music director Bill McGlaughlin received the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 from Fine Arts Radio International, which stated that, \\"Exploring Music, with its weekly thematic concept, provides the classical radio listener with both in- depth education and compelling radio listening, a balance that is rarely achieved.\\" The show also garnered Bill McGlaughlin and producer Steve Robinson the Dushkin Award from the Music Institute of Chicago, in 2008. In 2011, in presenting McGlaughlin their Lifetime Achievement Award, the Association of Music Personnel in Public Radio noted that \\"Bill McGlaughlin‚Äôs incredibly knowledgeable but always inviting and warm presence can ... be heard on Exploring Music, a daily program begun in 2002 in which he guides listeners to discover the heart, soul and humor of the music he plays.\\"\\"Bill McGlaughlin Receives Lifetime Achievement Award\\" . The Association of Music Personnel in Public Radio. May 30, 2011. Production and distribution Since McGlaughlin lives in New York City, and the WFMT production studio is in Chicago, production of Exploring Music occurs in two locations. After choosing a topic, McGlaughlin does extensive research at the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts, and via his own resources such as the 30-volume Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.Ward, Charles. \\"McGlaughlin Brings Voice to Chamber Choir: Q&A;\\". Houston Chronicle. April 25, 2008.Strauss, Elaine. \\"Exploring & Celebrating the Uncommon Music\\". U.S. 1. June 3, 2009. The Chicago producers collect 30 to 50 hours of relevant music selection samples, with their liner notes, from WFMT's extensive library in Chicago, and send them to McGlaughlin ‚Äî by making low-resolution MP3 files of them, burning them onto DVDs, and FedExing them. In New York, the team at radio station WQXR also combs their music library for more possibilities, and places the audio into iTunes for McGlaughlin to review.Siegmund, Bill. \\"News from the Audio Department.\\" Exploring Music blog. January 12, 2009 Mozart series: Mozart in Vienna, Mozart at his Zenith, Mozart's Piano Concertos, and Mozart's Birthday Bash. After sorting through and choosing which music selections to present, and finalizing his research and ideas, McGlaughlin then records the voice- track portion of the week's five one-hour shows, in the studios of WQXR in New York. The recording session is monitored in real time in Chicago via either ISDN or telephone. This allows McGlaughlin, his New York recording engineer, and the Chicago producers to interact freely, as if they were all in the same recording studio. McGlaughlin often voices the same narration section multiple ways, attempting to find the most concise and entertaining way to present the information, which also gives the producers editing options when they finalize each show. The voice-track audio files for the week's five shows are then sent to Chicago, where they are edited for time, and the high-resolution music selections are added in. This post-production process involves making artistic choices regarding which of Bill's narration samples to use, and how to present and place Bill's piano examples, snippet examples from CDs, and the musical pieces themselves. Choices are also made with timing in mind; extra movements or an extra unannounced musical snippet at the end of the show are added if a show runs short. Once each program is completed, a CD is made and given to the WFMT uplink department. The show is then distributed to radio stations around the country three ways: Physical duplicates are made of the master CD and shipped and the show is uploaded to the Public Radio Exchange (PRX) server for automatic internet distribution. Listeners nationwide and even worldwide are then able to hear Exploring Music, either broadcast on their local radio station, or via the internet through any one of over 30 online radio stations. Listening options Exploring Music airs daily on 55 public and commercial radio stations in the U.S.Station listings In Australia, Exploring Music airs on 3MBS at 9 AM, and on 4MBS at 7 PM; in Guam it airs on KPRG at 10 AM.KPRG program grid As of May 2013, Exploring Music also offers the option to stream any of its past and current programs on demand on its website. The on-demand archive includes a search function which can search for terms and names throughout all series and episodes, and also includes a feature which can separate the music from an episode from McGlaughlin's commentary and vice versa.\\"Exploring Music on Demand\\".

The team who did not commit the infringement are given possession of the ball and they may either kick it towards touch (in which case the ball back rule is waived), attempt a place kick at goal, or tap the ball with their foot and run. It is also sometimes used as shorthand for penalty goal. Reasons to award a penalty The referee signals that he has awarded a penalty to a side by raising his arm at 45 degrees between vertical and horizontal and blowing a blast on his whistle. The arm is raised on the side that won the penalty. Penalties may be awarded for a number of offences, including: * Failing to release the ball after being tackled, or the tackling player failing to release the tackled player. * Tackler not rolling away, to avoid obstructing the ball, if they are on the ground on the attacking team's side of the ruck. * Entering a ruck or maul from the side. * Using hands to grab or move the ball in a ruck, with the exception of the halfback, or player acting as halfback, in the team in possession. * Leaving one's feet in the ruck. * Deliberately collapsing a scrum or maul. * Scrum infringements: not binding properly on an opponent (for prop forwards) or a teammate (for other players); leaving the scrum before the ball has emerged from it; not pushing straight against the opposing pack. * Being offside and not making an effort to move to an onside position. * Tackling infringements: a high tackle (where contact is made above the shoulders); tackling a player in the air or a player holding a teammate off the ground; or tackling without trying to grasp the ball-carrier and bring him to ground (e.g. a shoulder charge or push). * Violent or foul play: punching, elbowing, kicking, headbutting, tripping and so forth. * Throwing or knocking the ball forwards, or out of play in any direction. * Tackling or holding an opponent who is not in possession of the ball. * Obstructing an opponent from tackling the ball-carrier (crossing). * Not retreating ten metres at a penalty. * Contesting or dissenting from a referee's decision, or using abusive language or conduct towards any match official. * Any other action the referee considers to be \\"contrary to good sportsmanship\\" (such as throwing the ball away while play is stopped in order to prevent a prompt restart, especially if time is close to expiring). Referees may not penalise some of these infringements if in their judgement the offending player had no intent to break the rules (e.g. a marginally late tackle on a player who has just kicked or passed the ball) or if the offending player was not participating in or affecting the game (e.g. a player who is in an offside position but not interfering with play). Equally, a referee may warn a team about technical infringements (especially at the scrum and ruck) before penalising them. A referee's willingness and ability to do so is a mark of good officiating in that it reduces stoppages in the game and allows the game to \\"flow\\". Restart options The side that is awarded the penalty restarts the game with a kick or scrum at their option. If a kick is taken, the side that the penalty was awarded against must retreat 10 metres (or to their goal line if closer). There are four ways of restarting the game: * A tap penalty, where a player drops the ball onto his foot and kicks it up into his arms and then carries the ball forward. This is often taken quickly to exploit lack of organisation in the opposition's retreating defence. * A kick to touch. The side with the penalty gets the throw-in to the resultant line- out, from which they have a good chance of securing possession. This is used mainly to gain territory, though it is also used as a tactic to gain a platform for a rolling maul near the opponent's try line and muscle over for a score. ** For most of the sport's history, the non-kicking team got the throw- in following a penalty kick going into touch. The current rule, which calls for the kicking team to get the throw-in, was not adopted until the early 1990s. * A kick at goal. The kick at goal is usually taken off the ground from a plastic tee (though it is possible to drop kick the ball). If it is successful, they score three points, and the opposition restart from the centre line. (In rugby sevens, the scoring team restarts from the centre line.) If the penalty is missed but the ball remains in play, play continues. If the penalty is missed and the ball goes dead a 22 metre drop-out is awarded to the opposition. * A scrum. A team may opt to have a scrum. This would normally be taken if an attacking team wished to have all the defensive forwards tied up in one place allowing the backs the luxury of a one on one confrontation. Alternatively, if a team has ascendancy in the scrums they may try for a pushover try, which may result in the award of a penalty try if the scrums are deliberately collapsed by the defending side.  Cross-code comparisons  One of the laws associated with penalties was experimented with in association football, that being that penalties may be moved 10 metres forward of their original position either due to talk-back from the players or offside from a quick tap penalty. This was dropped after variable application by referees, but remains a rugby union rule. A similar rule exists in Australian Rules: the 50-metre penalty moves the mark the approximate distance of a long mark, and is awarded for dissent and for slowing down or disrupting the restart.

He was a founding editor of The Australian. He was the owner of Daily Commercial News from 1969 to 1981, publisher of the Melbourne Observer from 1971 to 1977, and, during a similar time frame, the Canberra Post. Biography Maxwell Newton was born to George William Newton, lead-burner, and his wife Nora Christian, legal secretary, on 28 April 1928 at Nurse Doyle's Private Hospital, in Cottesloe, Western Australia. The family lived with Nora's parents at 17 York Terrace, Mosman Park. At the age of four they moved to Bayswater where Newton was to attend Bayswater State School until the age of 12, when he won a scholarship to the academically selective Perth Modern School. From there he matriculated with exhibitions in English and history. Newton graduated from the University of Western Australia with first class honours in economics and was awarded a Hackett scholarship to attend Clare College, Cambridge. From 1960 to 1964 Newton was editor of the Australian Financial Review, turning it from a weekly to a daily. In 1964 he became founding editor of The Australian but left in March 1965, after falling out with its owner, Rupert Murdoch. He then became correspondent for the London Economist and the Financial Times and in June 1965 began a weekly newsletter in Canberra, the Incentive (sub-titled A Weekly Report on Business Trends and Economic Policy by Maxwell Newton). In 1957, he became political correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald in Canberra. Future Prime Minister Billy McMahon would leak details of cabinet meetings to Newton, who would then publish them. In April 1969 Newton became founding editor of the Sunday Independent (Western Australia) published by Lang Hancock and E. A. \\"Peter\\" Wright. In 1969, Newton purchased shipping and commercial newspaper Daily Commercial News from Sir Ronald Brierley with funding from Marrickville Holdings. Soon after, in 1971, Newton published the Melbourne Observer after Gordon Barton closed his Sunday Observer. Newton later renamed his publication as the Sunday Observer. As the paper was only issued once a week Newton began publishing teen magazines (such as Scream and Sweet), entertainment publications (National Tattler and TV Guide) and soft-core pornography (Pleazure, Eros and Kings Cross Whisper) to keep the presses running. Newton Comics In 1975 he started publishing Marvel comics reprints, including Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Avengers, Incredible Hulk and an edition of Planet of the Apes. The first Newton Comics titles were issued in May 1975, accompanied by a massive marketing campaign. The heavy promotion initially paid off with sales of up to 30,000 recorded for the first issues, dropping to around 20,000 for the second and third issues. After a few months sales had dropped to 6,000-8,000 per issue. It soon became apparent that sales projections were grossly overestimated, with print runs being too high and returns from newsagents being substantial. By the end of 1976, Newton Comics was defunct. Following the collapse of his publishing empire Newton relocated to the United States and re-established his career as a right-wing economic journalist becoming financial editor of the New York Post, with his columns syndicated in the Murdoch press. In 1983 he published a book on the American monetary system. He died on 23 July 1990, aged 61.

It was rumoured that the band broke up on October 29, 2010, after a fight on stage at a show at the Lucky Bar in Victoria although their management stated that they merely cancelled the rest of their tour. History Women's debut album, Women, recorded by Chad VanGaalen, gained positive recognition from music publications including Pitchfork, AllMusic, PopMatters, Vue Weekly, and as well as other varied music blogs. The band's sound has been likened to \\"sunny Beach Boys pop [...] dragged into a dark alley and gleefully mutilated\\", as well as compared to other bands The Velvet Underground and The Zombies. Pitchfork Media named their song \\"Black Rice\\" from their debut album the 18th best track of 2008. After the release of their debut album Women extensively toured throughout 2008 and 2009, performing over 180 times in North America, Europe and the UK. Highlight performances took place at Barcelona's Primavera Sound, Austin's SXSW, Chicago's Pitchfork Music Festival and London's The Lexington. The band has toured or performed with Mogwai, Abe Vigoda, Dungen, Deerhunter, and Eric's Trip. The song \\"Black Rice\\" was also listed by Pitchfork as the 410th best song of the 2000s. Women's second album, Public Strain, was released in Canada, via Flemish Eye, and in the United States, UK, and Europe, via Jagjaguwar , on September 28, 2010.

It is located on the west of the island (part of the traditional North Side division) in the sheading of Michael. Local government For the purposes of local government, the whole of the historic parish forms a single parish district with Commissioners. The Captain of the Parish (since 1993) is Charles Edgar Cowin. Politics Ballaugh parish is part of the Ayre & Michael constituency, which elects two Members to the House of Keys. Before 2016 it was in the Michael constituency. Geography Ballaugh is a mainly agricultural district on the north-western coast of the island. Ballaugh runs for some along the north-west coastline of the island. The average breadth of the parish is about and it covers an area of around . The south-east corner is hilly and the remainder is low, including part of the marshy depression of the Curraghs. The only village in the parish is Ballaugh. History There are in Ballaugh a number of sites of historical interest. There is a heritage group who hold regular meetings and arrange walks around the area. Research into the social history of the area, in particular the isolated Glen Dhoo, is being carried out. The name 'Ballaugh' derives from the Manx Balley-ny-Loghey or \\"the place of the lake\\" cognate with loch and lough. The Ballaugh Curraghs is all that remains of this lake. The lake, which measured up to a mile in length, was drained by the excavation about 300 years ago of the silted-up Lhen Trench which, during the last ice age, is believed to have been a meltwater channel flowing north to south from the melting ice front. Demographics The Isle of Man census of 2016 returned a parish population of 1,032, a decrease of 1% from the figure of 1,042 in 2011. Curraghs Wildlife Park and Ballaugh Curragh One mile east of the village is Curraghs Wildlife Park, which was formerly run by the island's Department of Community, Culture and Leisure and is a haven for all sorts of wetland wildlife. Most of the park is laid out in geographical sections, representing different continents of the world and the animals that can be found there. The central part of the park has a different format and contains specific animal exhibits and visitor attractions. The park is located next to Ballaugh Curragh wetland, the first wildlife site on the island to be internationally recognised, when in 2006 it was designated a Ramsar wetland of international importance. The site qualifies for international status as it has excellent examples of wetland habitats characteristic of the island and the region: bog pools, marshy grassland, birch woodland, modified bog and willow scrub (known as curragh). It also has on occasions the largest numbers of winter roosting hen harriers in Western Europe and has breeding habitat for a highly endangered migratory bird, the corn crake. In 2005 the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry designated Ballaugh Curragh as an \\"Area of Special Scientific Interest\\". There are three partners involved in the Curragh: Curraghs Wildlife Park, Manx National Heritage and the Manx Wildlife Trust.

Video gaming reached mainstream popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, when arcade video games, gaming consoles and home computer games were introduced to the general public. Since then, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern culture in most parts of the world. The early history of video games, therefore, covers the period of time between the first interactive electronic game with an electronic display in 1947, the first true video games in the early 1950s, and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s (Pong and the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles with the Magnavox Odyssey, both in 1972). During this time there was a wide range of devices and inventions corresponding with large advances in computing technology, and the actual first video game is dependent on the definition of \\"video game\\" used. Following the 1947 invention of the cathode- ray tube amusement device‚Äîthe earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to use an electronic display‚Äîthe first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, human‚Äìcomputer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's draughts program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students by the end of the 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute. Throughout the rest of the 1960s increasing numbers of programmers wrote digital computer games, which were sometimes sold commercially in catalogs. As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost of computers, and programming languages that would run on multiple types of computers were created, a wider variety of games began to be developed. Video games transitioned into a new era in the early 1970s with the launch of the commercial video game industry in 1971 with the display of the coin- operated arcade game Galaxy Game and the release of the first arcade video game Computer Space, and then in 1972 with the release of the immensely successful arcade game Pong and the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, which launched the first generation of video-game consoles. Defining the video game Circuitry schematic from the patent for the cathode-ray tube amusement device The term \\"video game\\" has evolved over the decades from a purely technical definition to a general concept defining a new class of interactive entertainment. Technically, for a product to be a video game under early definitions, there must be a video signal transmitted to a cathode-ray tube (CRT) that creates a rasterized image on a screen.The Video Game Explosion, pp. 3‚Äì8 This definition would preclude early computer games that outputted results to a printer or teletype rather than a display, any game rendered on a vector-scan monitor, any game played on a modern high definition display, and most handheld game systems. From a technical standpoint, these would more properly be called \\"electronic games\\" or \\"computer games\\".Encyclopedia of Video Games, p. XV Today the term \\"video game\\" has completely shed its purely technical definition and encompasses a wider range of technology. While still rather ill-defined, the term \\"video game\\" now generally encompasses any game played on hardware built with electronic logic circuits that incorporates an element of interactivity and outputs the results of the player's actions to a display.Encyclopedia of Video Games, p. 3‚Äì7 Going by this broader definition, the first video games appeared in the early 1950s; they were tied largely to research projects at universities and large corporations, though, and had little influence on each other due to their primary purpose as academic and promotional devices rather than entertainment games. The ancestors to these games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate a cathode-ray tube screen.The Video Game Debate, p. 3 The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes.Before the Crash, pp. 1‚Äì2Replay, pp. 1‚Äì9 This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around the same time as the device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer. Initial games A drawing of the Nimrod computer The first electronic digital computers, Colossus and ENIAC, were built during World War II to aid the Allied war effort.Computer: A History of the Information Machine, pp. xii‚Äìxiii Shortly after the war, the promulgation of the first stored program architectures at the University of Manchester (Manchester Mark 1), University of Cambridge (EDSAC), the University of Pennsylvania (EDVAC), and Princeton University (IAS machine) allowed computers to be easily reprogrammed to undertake a variety of tasks, which facilitated commercializing computers in the early 1950s by companies like Remington Rand, Ferranti, and IBM.A History of Modern Computing, pp. 20‚Äì40 This in turn promoted the adoption of computers by universities, government organizations, and large corporations as the decade progressed. It was in this environment that the first video games were born. The computer games of the 1950s can generally be divided into three categories: training and instructional programs, research programs in fields such as artificial intelligence, and demonstration programs intended to impress or entertain the public. Because these games were largely developed on unique hardware in a time when porting between systems was difficult and were often dismantled or discarded after serving their limited purposes, they did not generally influence further developments in the industry. For the same reason, it is impossible to be certain who developed the first computer game or who originally modeled many of the games or play mechanics introduced during the decade, as there are likely several games from this period that were never publicized and are thus unknown today. The earliest known publicly demonstrated electronic game was created in 1950. Bertie the Brain was an arcade game of tic-tac-toe, built by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. To showcase his new miniature vacuum tube, the additron tube, he designed a specialized computer to use it, which he built with the assistance of engineers from Rogers Majestic. The large metal computer, which was four meters tall, could only play tic-tac-toe on a lightbulb-backed display, and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from August 25 to September 9, 1950. The game was a success at the two-week exhibition, with attendees lining up to play it as Kates adjusted the difficulty up and down for players. After the exhibition, Bertie was dismantled, and \\"largely forgotten\\" as a novelty. Kates has said that he was working on so many projects at the same time that he had no energy to spare for preserving it, despite its significance. Nearly a year later on May 5, 1951, the Nimrod computer‚Äîcreated by engineering firm and nascent computer developer Ferranti‚Äîwas presented at the Festival of Britain, and then showcased for three weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled. Using a panel of lights for its display, it was designed exclusively to play the game of Nim; moves were made by players pressing buttons which corresponded with the lights. Nimrod could play either the traditional or \\"reverse\\" form of the game. The machine was twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall. It was based on an earlier Nim-playing machine, \\"Nimatron\\", designed by Edward Condon and built by Westinghouse Electric in 1940 for display at the New York World's Fair. \\"Nimatron\\" had been constructed from electromechanical relays and weighed over a ton. The Nimrod was primarily intended to showcase Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than entertain, and was not followed up by any future games. Despite this, most of the onlookers at the Festival of Britain were more interested in playing the game than in the programming and engineering logic behind it. Christopher Strachey's 1952 draughts program on a Ferranti Mark 1 Around this time, non-visual games were being developed at various research computer laboratories; for example, Christopher Strachey developed a simulation of the game draughts, or checkers, for the Pilot ACE that he unsuccessfully attempted to run for the first time in July 1951 at the British National Physical Laboratory and completed in 1952; this is the first known computer game to be created for a general-purpose computer, rather than a machine specifically made for the game like Bertie.The Video Game Explosion, pp. 31‚Äì34 Strachey's program inspired Arthur Samuel to develop his own checkers game in 1952 for the IBM 701; successive iterations developed rudimentary artificial intelligence by 1955 and a version was shown on television in 1956. Also in 1951, Dietrich Prinz wrote the first limited program of chess for the University of Manchester's general-purpose Ferranti Mark 1 computer, one of the first commercially available computers. The program was only capable of computing \\"mate-in-two\\" problems as it was not powerful enough to play a full game, and it had no video output. Around the same time in the early 1950s, military research organizations like the RAND Corporation developed a series of combat simulation games of increasing complexity, such as Carmonette, where the player would enter orders to intercept enemy aircraft, or set up their forces to counter an enemy army invasion. These simulations were not yet true video games, as they required human intervention to interpret the player's orders and the final results; the computer only controlled the paths that the enemies would take, and the program was focused on simulating events and probabilities. Interactive visual games The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator in 1948, which ran OXO In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a software program for the EDSAC computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC was one of the first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35√ó16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human‚Äìcomputer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow.The Computing Universe, p. 174 The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen. The first known game incorporating graphics that updated in real time, rather than only when the player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for a demonstration of the University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer. The set-up for Tennis for Two as exhibited in 1959 While further games like checkers and chess were developed on research computers, the next milestone in video games came in 1958 with Tennis for Two. Perhaps the first game created solely for entertainment rather than as a technology demonstration or a research tool, the program simulated a game of tennis. Created by American physicist William Higinbotham for visitors at the Brookhaven National Laboratory to be more entertaining for visitors on their public day than the usual static exhibits about nuclear power, the game ran on a Donner Model 30 analog computer and displayed a side view of a tennis court on an oscilloscope. The players controlled the angle of their shots with attached controllers, and the game calculated and simulated the trajectory of the ball, including the possibility of hitting the net. The game was first shown on October 18, 1958. Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut. Due to the game's popularity, an upgraded version was shown the following year, with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity. Afterwards, having served its purpose, the game was dismantled for its component parts. While the game had no innovations in game design or technological development, its status as an entertainment-focused game, rather than an academic project or technological showpiece, has led it to be considered one of the first \\"real\\" video games as they are generally thought of today. Over the next few years, during 1957‚Äì61, various computer games continued to be created in the context of academic computer and programming research, particularly as computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate students, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer. These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and Bob Saunders. The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze. Mouse in the Maze allowed users to use a light pen to set up a maze of walls on the monitor, and spots that represented bits of cheese or glasses of martini. A virtual mouse was then released and would traverse the maze to find the objects. Additionally, the wargame simulations from the early 1950s by the RAND Corporation had expanded into more complicated simulations which required little human intervention, and had also sparked the creation of business management simulation games such as The Management Game, which was used in business schools such as at Carnegie Mellon University by 1958. By 1961, there were over 89 different business simulation games in use, with various graphical capabilities.Business simulation in industrial and university education As the decade ended, despite several video games having been developed, there was no such thing as a commercial video game industry; almost all games had been developed on or as a single machine for specific purposes, and the few simulation games were neither commercial nor for entertainment. The spread of games Spacewar! running on the Computer History Museum's PDP-1 By 1961, MIT had acquired the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer, the successor to the TX-0, which also used a vector display system. The system's comparatively small size and processing speed meant that, like with the TX-0, the university allowed its undergraduate students and employees to write programs for the computer which were not directly academically related whenever it was not in use. In 1961‚Äì62, Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen created the game Spacewar! on the PDP-1, inspired by science fiction books such as the Lensman series.Introduction to Game Development The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American academic institutions, making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.Understanding Digital Games, p. 22 The two-player game has the players engaged in a dogfight between two spaceships set against the backdrop of a randomly generated background starfield. The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game.High Score, p. 12 The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad.Replay, pp. 10‚Äì13 Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware.Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 () and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games. Space Travel in 1969 in part led to the development of the Unix operating system Although the market for commercial games‚Äîand software in general‚Äîwas small, due to the cost of computers limiting their spread to research institutions and large corporations, several were still created by programmers and distributed by the computer manufacturers. A number of games could be found in an April 1962 IBM program catalog. These included board games, \\"BBC Vik The Baseball Demonstrator\\", and \\"Three Dimensional Tic-Tack-Toe\\". Following the spread of Spacewar, further computer games developed by programmers at universities were also developed and distributed over the next few years. These included the Socratic System, a question and answer game designed to teach medical students how to diagnose patients by Wallace Feurzeig in 1962, and a dice game by Edward Steinberger in 1965. Mainframe games were developed outside of the IBM and DEC communities as well, such as the 1962 Polish Marienbad for the Odra 1003. A joint research project between IBM and the Board of Cooperative Educational Services of Westchester County, New York led to the creation of The Sumerian Game, one of the first strategy video games ever made, the first game with a narrative, and the first edutainment game; it was also the first known game to be designed by a woman, teacher Mabel Addis. The creation of general programming languages like BASIC, which could be run on different hardware types, allowed for programs to be written for more than one specific computer, in turn letting games written in them to spread to more end players in the programming community than before. These games included a baseball simulation game written in BASIC by John Kemeny in 1965; a BASIC bingo game by Larry Bethurum in 1966; a basketball simulation game written in BASIC by Charles R. Bacheller in May 1967; another baseball game that simulates the 1967 World Series written in BASIC by Jacob Bergmann in August 1967; Space Travel, written by Ken Thompson for a Multics system in 1969 and which led in part to the development of the Unix operating system; and Hamurabi, a text- based FOCAL game written by Doug Dyment in 1968 based on a description of The Sumerian Game and converted to BASIC by David H. Ahl in 1969. Hamurabi and Space Travel were among several early mainframe games that were written during the time, and spread beyond their initial mainframe computers to general- purpose languages like BASIC.BASIC Computer Games, p. 78 A new industry Galaxy Game was one of the first arcade video games. At the beginning of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, at Stanford University using a DEC PDP-11 computer with vector displays. The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000 (); while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.Replay, pp. 14‚Äì26 Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price. That game was Computer Space, developed by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They had found the Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100.High Score, p. 16 By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed for a short time in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy.Atari, Inc., pp. 40‚Äì44 Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation. Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!.High Score, p. 13 Galaxy Games prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan. Pong helped usher in a new chapter of video game history. Around the same time as Galaxy Games prototype installation, Computer Space was released. It was the first coin-operated video game to be commercially sold (and the first widely available video game of any kind).The Ultimate History of Video Games, pp. 38‚Äì39 While it did well in its initial locations near college campuses, it performed very poorly in bars and arcades where pinball and other arcade games were typically placed; while it was commercially successful and made over US$1,000,000, it did not meet the high expectations of Nutting, who had expected to sell more than 1,500 units. Bushnell and Dabney immediately started work on another game, using the same television set design as Computer Space, as well as founding their own company Atari, Inc. to back their projects. While initially this game was to be a driving game that Bushnell planned to design, their first employee, Allan Alcorn, took a prototype ping- pong game suggestion of Bushnell's and expanded on it to create a game the company immediately seized on. They were unable to find a manufacturer, but on the evidence of the success of their prototype installation, decided to produce the game cabinets themselves. Pong was released in 1972, a year after Computer Space. It was immensely commercially successful, selling over 8,000 units. It inspired copycat games to be sold in America, Europe, and Japan, and led to the popularization of the medium. That same year saw the release of the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console which could be connected to a television set. The inventor, Ralph H. Baer, had initially had the idea in 1951 to make an interactive game on a television set. Unable to do so with the technological constraints at the time, he began work on a device that would attach to a television set and display games in 1966, and the \\"Brown Box\\", the last prototype of seven, was licensed to Magnavox to adapt and produce. They announced the console in May 1972, and it went on sale that September. The console and its games featured numerous innovations beyond being the first video game device for home consumers: it was the first game to use a raster-scan video display, or television set, directly displayed via modification of a video signal; it was also the first video gaming device to be displayed in a television commercial. It sold for US$100 and shipped with several games, including \\"Table tennis\\", which Bushnell had seen a demo of and which Pong had been based on. The Odyssey sold over 100,000 units in 1972, and more than 350,000 by the end of 1975, buoyed by the popularity of the table tennis game, in turn driven by the success of Pong. Pong and the Odyssey kicked off a new era of video gaming, with numerous other competitors starting up in the video game industry as it grew in popularity.

It carried Missouri Route 5 across the Osage Arm of the lake. It was perhaps one of the most distinctive features on the lake. It was the only truss-type bridge remaining on the lake. The American Institute of Steel Construction selected the bridge as the most beautiful steel span built in 1936. It was about half a mile long.  History  Construction for the bridge began in 1934 and was completed in 1936. The bridge was one of three bridges on the lake constructed with the truss support below the deck enabling passengers to see the lake clearly. The bridge construction was similar to that of the original Niangua Bridge. Before the bridge was built, cars were moved across the lake by ferry. At one time the bridge was originally a toll bridge. The prices to pass were 40 cents for car and driver, 5 cents for each additional passenger; cars towing trailers had to pay 60 cents plus the nickel surcharge for each additional passenger. You could also save a dime by purchasing a round trip toll. In 2012, MODOT replaced the bridge with a Delta Frame Bridge.http://www.modot.org/business/contractor_resources/bid_opening_info/documents/J5P2188ATCMeetingInformation.pdf The Hurricane Deck Bridge was demolished in December 2013.  Similarities and differences to the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge  The Hurricane Deck Bridge was one of the most similar bridges to the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in the nation and the most identical in Missouri. However, it was in much better condition than the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge. It was of the Deck-truss construction for Vehicular traffic. The Hurricane Deck Bridge had a longer main span than the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge (462 feet vs. 458 feet). The I-35W Mississippi River bridge spanned both sides of the Mississippi River in contrast to the Hurricane Deck Bridge. Its daily traffic was about 8,000 cars daily versus 140,000 cars daily. Due to this, the Hurricane Deck Bridge had a weaker steel construction than the I-35W Bridge steel construction.

Deposits of the group are most commonly found in non-marine aquatic depositional environments from central Europe and Greenland, but other remains have been found in Russia, Scandinavia, and possibly Thailand.  Material  The majority of plagiosaurid remains are of the genus Gerrothorax, which have been recovered from the Fleming Fjord Formation of Jameson Land, East Greenland, and from many localities in southern Germany. All of this material is currently assigned to a single species, pulcherrimus. Plagiosuchus material is also very abundant, though poorly preserved and has been found only from Germany. Additional material, including the material of all other plagiosaurids, is significantly more fragmentary and less abundant than that of Gerrothorax. These additional materials are predominantly from Germany and Russia with some potential material also reported from Thailand and Brazil.  Description  Plagiosaurids are predominantly characterized by the unique structure of their skulls and the armor that lines their trunk. The heads of these animals are short and wide with an overall semi-circular layout and extremely large orbital fenestrae. The skull and trunk of these organisms are generally vertically compressed to varying degrees within members of the clade to form an overall flattened body plan. Some articulated, three-dimensional preservation of plagiosaurids indicates that this flattening was a feature of the animals in life and is not a preservation artifact. The amount of vertical compression in plagiosaurids varies somewhat with the most basal member, Plagiosuchus, being only somewhat compressed while more derived members such as Gerrothorax and Megalopthalma being much significantly more compressed. Their skull, also vertically compressed, has dorsally oriented large orbital fenestrae and contained a battery of small teeth the curve inward. The trunks of these animals have shortened limbs relative their body size and the backs were generally covered in bony armor which is denser in the more derived members of the clade.  Ecology  Plagiosaurids are believed to have lived an almost entirely aquatic lifestyle. Much of this interpretation stems from analysis of the remains of Gerrothorax because specimens of this group are so much more abundant and well preserved than other plagiosaurid remains. Aside from their remains being found dominantly within aquatic settings, evidence for an aquatic lifestyle comes primarily from evidence that the clade possessed internal gills, given by the presence of branchial arches that were lined with arteries. Additionally, the limbs of plagiosaurids are short relative to their body size and the size of their pectoral girdle. Coupled with their vertically compressed body plan, a popular interpretation for these organisms has been that they lived on the floor of freshwater systems and were obligatorily aquatic. To facilitate a bottom dwelling lifestyle these organisms possess a special jaw joint, the atlanto-occipital joint, which facilitates the lifting of the cranium to open the mouth rather than lowering the jaw as would be expected in other organisms. Consequently, it is presumed that the animal would lay flat on river or lake beds waiting in ambush to catch prey, such as fish. It has been proposed that they may have captured prey via suction by rapidly opening their mouth and then clamping down with their curved teeth. This is somewhat supported by the lateral elongation of the skull in later plagiosaurids like Gerrothorax and Plagiosternum compared to earlier members such as Plagiosuchus. The elongation of the skull is interpreted to have facilitated muscle attachment to the back of the skull and increasing the ability and force directed toward lifting the head. The large orbits of plagiosaurids have only been extensively analyzed in a single study which put forth two plausible eye structures. According to this study, because of their incredibly flat and vertically compressed skulls, it is unlikely that the eyes actually filled the space of the groups large orbits because the eyes would permanently protrude into at least part of the palate. Thus, it is most plausible that, like many modern amphibians, the eyes of these animals were actually significantly smaller than the orbit and positioned toward the front of the skull, though there is not enough data to make conclusive judgment about their exact position. Schoch et al. (2014) also put forward the hypothesis that the group had large, flat, lensless eyes similar to a family of abyss dwelling teleost fish, the Ipnopidae. These lensless eyes would allow plagiosaurids to detect when something is moving directly above them by causing a shadow in the light detected by the retina. While not observed among modern amphibians today, this hypothesis does align with the interpreted life habit of plagiosaurids and helps to explain the abnormal space afforded to the orbits of these animals. Plagiosaurids also represent an interesting case of extreme evolutionary and morphological stasis. The features of these animals change very little through their evolutionary history despite changes. Schoch and Witzmann analyzed the collections of Gerrothorax material and noted that, despite being recovered from multiple environments that encompass approximately 40 million years of time, the general body plan of Gerrothorax was relatively static. This was interpreted to support a relatively high degree of biological flexibility in these animals despite their somewhat unique ecology. References External links *Plagiosauridae at Palaeos.

Like Lego Island 2, the game was developed by Silicon Dreams Studio. It was co-published by Electronic Arts and Lego Interactive, and was released in 2002, for the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows, with a spin-off also released for Game Boy Advance.  Plot  Pepper Roni has been cast as the lead in an action movie being filmed on Lego Island (appropriately titled \\"Xtreme Stunts\\") and the Brickster (who had somehow made it back to Lego Island) has been released from jail after he claimed to have reformed and is now playing a part of the film. After performing a motorbike jump through a large poster as a publicity stunt, he is then taken to the first scene where he performs a high-speed freeway car chase after the Brickster, who has been ironically cast as the main villain of the film. Upon completion, Pepper is given free roam of Lego Island, allowing him to explore and complete side missions as he continues the film in other locations throughout the island. As the player makes more progress in missions, it becomes more and more apparent that the Brickster has plans of his own, and later he kidnaps the Infomaniac and reveals his tower that his Brickster-Bots have built and has made a supercomputer that will disassemble the entire world. Pepper naturally comes to the rescue while the host tries to shut down the supercomputer. He once again outwits and imprisons the Brickster while the supercomputer was instead reprogrammed to disassemble the tower, allowing the film to be completed and released on schedule (which the player is able to view upon completion of the game). In the end, Pepper has access to all areas of the island, allowing him to redo scenes of the movie and different tasks. The game also gives a bit more canon (e.g. explaining why the Legondos broke up). = Characters = The majority of the original Lego Island and Lego Island 2 cast return. Pepper Roni remains the star of the game, while his adoptive parents Mama and Papa Brickolini continue their career running a pizzeria. The Infomaniac's role has been reduced from the player's guide to a simple cameo. Others retain their roles, such as Ed Mail the postman, Nick and Laura Brick the police officers, Mrs. Post the grocer, and others. The studio director is introduced, serving as a guide for the player through the stunts and giving him various objectives throughout the game itself. Unlike Lego Island and Lego Island 2, Pepper does not speak any dialogue in the game aside from grunts and one-word exclamations, making him a silent protagonist. When doing stunt work, however, he can make comments that are more than one word.  Gameplay  Like Lego Island 2, the player controls Pepper throughout the game, exploring the island in a non-linear style. Players are able to control and ride various vehicles throughout the city (only once they have obtained their correct licences). There are various collectible items scattered throughout that will rebuild animals composed of large Lego pieces, and there are also minigames in some parts of the city, such as helping one of the grocery store owners arrange and organize crates for storage. When filming stunts, the player is briefed by the director on how to perform the stunts within the scene, followed by a \\"practice room\\" where Pepper can practice controlling the vehicle used in front of a bluescreen (as various Brickster Bots control the mechanics for him). The player is then taken to \\"perform\\" the scene by playing the minigame within it. Upon its completion, players are taken to the screening room to see a \\"take\\" of the scene, which includes some humorous and unintentional event taking place behind the scenes (different difficulties play different takes). Players are then graded on their performance, based on how quickly objectives were completed and how many bonus stunts were performed.  Sets  From 2002 to 2003, an official Island Xtreme Stunts series of Lego sets was released. The line featured replications of the characters to semi-canonical sets such as skateboard parks and various vehicles used in the game. However, these did not financially impact the success of either the game or the Lego series itself, and the theme was discontinued after the first year. The sets are now collectors' items. Reception The PC version holds a 71 at Metacritic and the PS2 version holds a 63. Official PlayStation Magazine gave the game a 70 and stated on a positive note that \\"there's surprising depth and lots to do for a younger crowd. It's perfect for an under-13 gamer\\" whereas IGN says there are much better titles for children.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 22, 2013. In the episode, Comic Book Guy creates a new superhero called Everyman who takes powers from other superheroes. Homer is cast as the lead in the film adaptation. To get Homer into shape, the movie studio hires a celebrity fitness trainer, Lyle McCarthy, to help him. Homer gets into great shape and is really excited, but when McCarthy leaves to train another client, he starts over-eating again and ultimately this leads to the film's failure. The episode was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who are \\"obsessed\\" fans of the show, and directed by Lance Kramer. \\"Homer The Whopper\\" was intended to be a commentary on how Hollywood treats superhero films. Rogen also guest stars in the episode as the character Lyle McCarthy, making him the second guest star to both write an episode and appear in it; Ricky Gervais was the first. \\"Homer the Whopper\\" has received mixed reviews from television critics and acquired a Nielsen rating of 4.3 in its original broadcast. Plot Bart and Milhouse convince Comic Book Guy to publish a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic books he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a film. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a film, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. After a month, Homer becomes fit and the film begins production. Soon afterward, however, McCarthy leaves Homer for another client. Without McCarthy to keep him in shape, Homer starts eating again and gains all the weight back. Homer can no longer fit into his costume or even his trailer, and the film begins to go over budget. The studio executives and Comic Book Guy worry that the film will not be successful. The final version of the film features scenes with the fat Homer and the physically fit Homer merged, upsetting and confusing the audience. After the premiere of the film, McCarthy returns and offers to get Homer into shape again, which Homer accepts. The studio executives offer to let Comic Book Guy direct the sequel, on the condition that Comic Book Guy lie to the fans and say he liked the film. Though pleased by the offer, Comic Book Guy rejects it and openly criticizes the film online, and thus it becomes a box office failure and Everyman is never adapted again. Production alt=A Caucasian male wearing dark glasses, brown, curly hair, and a brown beard. He is sitting on a chair, laughing, wearing a yellow buttoned shirt. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, writers of the film Superbad, are \\"obsessed\\" fans of The Simpsons. After learning that The Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks was a fan of Superbad, they decided to ask the producers of the show if they could write an episode. In 2006, Ricky Gervais, co-creator of The Office, received credit for writing the season 17 episode \\"Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife\\". Rogen and Goldberg \\"thought if [Gervais] got to write one, maybe [they] could try.\\" They were invited to The Simpsons writers room, where they pitched several episode ideas. One was accepted, and they wrote an outline with the help of some feedback from the regular writers. Rogen commented that he and Goldberg wanted to show with the episode how Hollywood generally ruins superhero films. He said that \\"the whole joke is that Homer is cast to play a guy who's an everyman and they try to make him into this physically fit guy.\\" Rogen also noted that the plot mirrors the situation he was in while working on the film The Green Hornet, when he had to lose weight and do physical training for his role. Show runner Al Jean commented that the writers tried not to repeat the comic book film theme from the \\"Radioactive Man\\" episode. Instead they decided to parody the fact that almost every comic book has been turned into a film. Jean commented that that scene in the episode in which the studio executives \\"are trying to think up an idea that hasn't been done really is what they are doing these days [in real life].\\" The table read took place in August 2008, and production on the episode began soon after that. Rogen later said that \\"we sat down for a read- through and three hours later I'm in a studio improv-ing with Homer Simpson, it was the single greatest day of my life.\\" Rogen also guest stars in the episode as the character Lyle McCarthy, making him the second guest star to both write an episode and appear in it; Gervais also appeared in the episode he wrote. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening also makes an appearance in the episode. Reception In its original American broadcast in the United States on September 22, 2013, \\"Homer The Whopper\\" was watched in 8.31 million homes and acquired a 4.3 Nielsen rating/12 share. Since airing, \\"Homer the Whopper\\" has received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Steve Fritz of Newsarama called the episode \\"amazing\\" and commented that the \\"overall comic book theme was perfect.\\" Reviewers for TV Guide cited Matt Groening's cameo, the dinner table scene, Homer trying to lose weight at the Kwik-E-Mart, and the opening scene where Bart questions Comic Book Guy about Spider-Man as the highlights of the episode. Robert Canning of IGN was positive about \\"Homer The Whopper\\", giving it an 8.6/10 rating. He commented that the first act of the episode was the strongest, while the others were weaker. Canning believed the reason for this was that the viewers have already seen Homer \\"struggle with his weight countless times, and Rogen's trainer, though funny much of the time, will likely never be remembered as a classic guest role.\\" He added, however, that Rogen and Goldberg are able to find \\"a few new angles with the weight jokes, so it's not a complete loss.\\" Overall, Canning thought \\"Homer The Whopper\\" was a good start to the twenty-first season, and although the plot may not be very original, the writers added \\"freshness to the proceedings.\\" The A.V.

At an estimated , the brachiopoid from Lesotho is one of the largest amphibians sensu lato ever known. This estimate is based on a single jaw fragment found in 1970 by a French expedition near Alwynskop in Quthing. Because of its size, the fragment was initially considered to be from a mastodonsaur. However, the specimen was redescribed as a brachyopoid in 2005. Several features of the specimen indicate that it is from a brachyopoid. There is a large tusk protruding from the ectopterygoid, a bone of the palate, and the dental morphology is similar to that of other brachyopoids.

The first album was released in 1994 while the second was released in 2004. Part one Excuses for Bad Behavior (Part One) is a combination of spoken comedy bits, comedic songs, and pop/rock music. Co-written and co-produced by Bernhard's longtime collaborator Mitch Kaplan, the album features Bernhard singing originals and standards. Disco classic \\"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\\" begins with a vocal solo and is then translated to a modern dance song. \\"Manic Superstar\\" combines the song \\"Everything's Alright\\" from the musical Jesus Christ Superstar and the song \\"Manic Depression\\" by Jimi Hendrix. \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\" by the Rolling Stones is also covered. Comedic bits include the spoken word \\"The Letter\\" in which Bernhard reads a fictional letter from a lesbian fan who has \\"heard\\" the album in question (\\"Jesus Christ, why is she singing?\\"). \\"Christmas\\" is a story of holidays past told by a Jewish woman who never actually experienced them. Other songs have a comedic edge, such as \\"Prophecies\\", a spoof on 1-900 psychic hotlines. The album was released on a smaller independent label and did moderately well, but is currently unavailable for mainstream purchase. Plans for a special 2-disc re- release version (made exclusively available on Bernhard's website) have been posted there for over a year, but no product has been offered yet. =Reception= =Track listing= #\\"Excuses For Bad Behavior\\" #\\"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\\" #\\"Manic Superstar\\" #\\"(I'm Waiting)\\" #\\"Who Knew?!\\" #\\"Innocence\\" #\\"The Letter\\" #\\"Lonely Town\\" #\\"Christmas\\" #\\"Prophecies\\" #\\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" #\\"Manhattan\\" #\\"Phone Sex (Do You Want Me Tonight?)\\" #\\"(I'm Waiting)\\" #\\"50 Ways To Leave Your Lover\\" #\\"La Lupe\\" #\\"The Woman I Could've Been\\" #\\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" Part two Excuses for Bad Behavior (Part Two), like Part One, is a combination of spoken comedy bits, comedic songs, and pop/country/rock music.

Bernhard announced in 1995 that she had no interest in making a (Part 2), despite the title of (Part 1) , and that rather the title was simply a \\"tongue-in-cheek twist on\\" the Guns N' Roses albums Use Your Illusion I & II. The album deals heavily with politics, including discussions about 9/11. In The Dixie Chicks, Bernhard sings: \\"The Dixie Chicks were wrong, then right. I can't comprehend what is true. You tell me something, then take it back. Why the hell do you support Iraq?\\". The political controversy that surrounded The Dixie Chicks is discussed. A small tour was launched to accompany the release.

The couple is commonly referred to by the nickname \\"Scrubs\\", rather than by a portmanteau like other supercouples. Robin, the daughter of popular characters Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) and Anna Devane (Finola Hughes), is portrayed by Kimberly McCullough, the original actress cast in the role who has portrayed the character sporadically since she was seven in 1985. Jason Thompson was cast as legendary 1980s character Dr. Noah Drake's (Rick Springfield) son Patrick in December 2005. After their meeting for the first time and their first few scenes together, the developing couple's relationship became popular among General Hospital fans. After the birth of their daughter, Emma Grace Scorpio Drake, interrupts their first wedding on October 31, 2008 (she is born on-screen November 3), the couple finally weds on December 26, 2008.Stated on air, by character Patrick Drake. Writing and music Canadian actor Jason Thompson was cast as \\"dreamy yet arrogant\\" Dr. Patrick Drake on General Hospital in December 2005. Kimberly McCullough had already been part of the series since 1985 as character Robin Scorpio. The writers detailed Patrick as the brilliant neurosurgeon son of Dr. Noah Drake. By having Patrick fall in love with Robin, the show‚Äôs most popular heroine and also HIV positive, the series set out to create one of the genre's \\"most unique and touching love stories\\". \\"These are the kids of legacy characters Robert Scorpio and Noah Drake, giants of General Hospital history,\\" said SOAPnet executive vice president and general manager Deborah Blackwell. \\"She‚Äôs HIV positive, he‚Äôs trying to change his ways, and they‚Äôre in love. It‚Äôs an incredibly compelling storyline.\\" With General Hospital:Night Shift, the writers anchored the show around Patrick and Robin and felt that this gave them an advantage on other couples within the series. \\"It‚Äôs nice to start with the premise of a love story. Viewers know Robin and Patrick, but haven‚Äôt seen a ton happen to them just yet. It gives us something to follow and root for right away,\\" stated Jill Farren Phelps. In addition, the pairing would continue to appear on General Hospital. Executives did not want Night Shift to be \\"your mother‚Äôs General Hospital\\" and outlined Patrick and Robin's love story to involve the various ills and plagues of their patients, portrayed by a variety of guest stars. They felt this would expand the focus from a soap opera's \\"trademark tangled web\\" of romance to include the patients and their illnesses. Robin was presented as an accomplished medical professional who has been living with and successfully managing HIV for almost 15 years when she meets Patrick. \\"The heart of the show will be about the cases and how they impact our doctors,‚Äù said Brian Frons, president of Disney-ABC TV Group. With Patrick and Robin as the show's main romance, the series was designed to tackle \\"grittier\\" and more \\"controversial\\" subject matter, partly due to daytime standards being different than what writers can do in prime time. On May 29, 2006, Memorial Day, the series had Patrick and Robin make love for the first time to \\"Collide\\" by Howie Day. When the couple exchanged \\"I love yous\\", their official song became \\"Cloud Nine\\" by Cory Paul. Storylines =2005‚Äì06= Dr. Robin Scorpio returns to Port Charles, New York in October 2005, having left in 1999 and coming back for a brief return in 2004. Samantha McCall (Kelly Monaco) seeks out Robin in New York City where she is giving a conference on drug treatment. Sam desperately asks Robin to help her save her fianc√© and Robin's ex-boyfriend, Jason Morgan (Steve Burton). Jason is near death, suffering from brain damage as a result of taking an unknown drug to further his investigation of psychotic psychiatrist, Dr. Thomas. Robin agrees to return to help Jason with her experimental drug treatment. When the treatment fails, Jason is closer to death and in dire need of brain surgery. Robin went to find Noah Drake and he was too drunk to perform the surgery. He tells her about his son, Dr. Patrick Drake, and said that he could perform the surgery on Jason. Patrick and Robin share their first scenes when she finds him having sex with a nurse in one of the rooms at the hospital he is working at. After hearing all about Jason's case from Robin, Patrick agrees to examine Jason, but does not officially agree to the surgery. Together, Patrick and Robin go back to Port Charles. After reviewing Jason's case, Patrick decides not to do the surgery until Robin challenges him. Proving that he is the \\"most gifted\\" doctor, Patrick performs the surgery successfully and Jason recovers. Patrick decides to continue working at General Hospital, and relocates to Port Charles. Robin also decides to stay in the place she called home for most of her life. The two often disagree on patients' treatment, with Patrick leaning toward more invasive surgeries and Robin wanting to use drug therapies. The opposing physicians quarrel at the hospital on a daily basis. But it is Noah and Patrick's non-existent father/son relationship that helps develop Patrick and Robin's relationship. When he was a teenager, Patrick's mother died during a surgery that Noah was performing. Noah could not forgive himself and turned to alcohol as a result. He became a neglectful father and his relationship with Patrick suffered severely. At the same time, Robin developed her own set of father issues with the re-emergence of a not-so-dead Robert Scorpio. Early on, Robin and Patrick connected because of their dead beat nonexistent fathers. Though her father left shortly after he returned and never fully healed their broken relationship, Robin tried to mend the fence between Patrick and Noah and in a way acted as mediator. Robin and Patrick learn more about each other's pasts and soon Robin is able to convince Patrick to talk to his father. In conversation, Patrick admits his love for his father and inspires Noah to go to rehab. For most of 2006, Robin has to deal with not only her complicated relationship with Patrick but trying to mend the relationship between herself and her parents. They start a \\"no-strings sex\\" agreement. When Patrick and Robin start to get closer, Patrick gets scared and \\"breaks up\\" with Robin, stating he does not want an \\"emotional bond\\". Eventually, thanks to Noah, Patrick and Robin find their way back to each other. Soon after, tragedy strikes - Patrick, while performing brain surgery on a patient with end stage AIDS, is stuck with an infected needle and might have contracted HIV. During this time, Patrick realizes just how much Robin means to him and just how much of a strong, amazing person she is. Robin stands by Patrick all throughout his ordeal. Patrick blurts out that he loves her and after some road bumps, they properly declare their love for one another in a courtyard in November 2006. In December, Robin finds an apartment for Patrick. Though reluctant at first, he decides to keep the place. What came next for the twosome has become to be known as \\"The Couch Chronicles\\" where Robin bought a leather couch for Patrick (since he was none too eager to buy furniture for himself, and Robin saying she enjoyed that sort of decorating), Patrick taking back the couch (after his friend Pete Marquez scared him believing Robin had ulterior motives), Patrick reordering the couch, Robin insisting he take it back and finally Robin seeing he liked the couch (this and agreeing to move in with him, which was also a source of argument for the two in between the couch fighting). Robin moved in for one day, and by the next Pete was over trying to get Patrick to leave for Vegas to reprogram him. It wasn't until Noah came by offering his congratulations that Patrick felt backed into a corner and left with Pete for Las Vegas. A hurt Robin called on her girlfriends for what hoped to be a roadtrip but was arrested shortly after when a guy came onto her. Patrick had an unpleasant time in Vegas and called Robin only to find out she had been arrested. After each had a talk with wise Uncle Mac (John J. York), Patrick apologized but Robin was too upset. Patrick's 6 month HIV tests came back at the same time. They came back inconclusive. Robin tried her best to convince him to take it again but Patrick was stubborn and believed this was a bad sign telling him he was positive. =2007‚Äì08= In February 2007, Robin is shot in the stomach during a hostage situation at the Metro Court Hotel. Emily Quartermaine (Natalia Livingston), with the assistance of Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) and Patrick (via telephone), saves Robin's life. While Robin was in peril, Patrick was a wreck. At the culmination of the hostage crisis, Robin's friend, Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher), carries Robin out of the Metro Court to safety. She undergoes surgery to remove the bullet in her abdomen. At the hospital, Patrick tells her that he thought the worst thing that could happen to him was him testing positive for HIV but he realized that HIV would be a blessing compared to losing her because he loves her \\"beyond reason\\". On March 2, 2007, Robin is released from the hospital and brought home to her Uncle Mac's house to recuperate. Patrick's HIV test results came back as an affirmative negative. Both were relieved. On March 15, 2007, Robin attempts to get her life back to normal and goes to work. But she is told to leave by Dr. Russell Ford, despite Patrick's and Monica's (Leslie Charleson) words of assurance that she will be able to handle being back at work so soon after her surgery. She gives in and leaves the hospital. Later, she is sitting on the pier, thinking, when Patrick shows up. He says that he is looking for her and she replies that she had run out of private thinking spots. Patrick says that he tried the park first and had hoped that she had gone there instead of the pier where there are many stairs. Patrick and Robin make up and discuss \\"therapy\\" options. In the end, Patrick carries her home. On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin argue over her decision to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not to draw attention to herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody‚Äîespecially Patrick‚Äîand he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig out of the corner of her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together. After a few months of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a pregnancy scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She wants more from him (children), while he is happy just the way they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, but it would have been a great year. Robin is devastated by her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible outburst at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees her as she truly is, and tells him that it is not about getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she walks into the locker room she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) has come back negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves out the fact that he is the father. She tells him that she went to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is. Although he thinks she is having a baby with someone else, Patrick cannot stay away from Robin or her child. After several occurrences, Patrick slowly realizes that he may in fact be the father of her baby. After they have a heart to heart, however, and Patrick asks about the paternity of the baby. Robin admits he is the father. But even though she is pregnant, Robin cannot let go of the fact that he never wanted children. Arguments and resentment builds from both sides- Patrick wanting to be a part of his child's life, Robin telling him it's her baby that he never wanted. Eventually, being confronted by her past‚Äîremembering how wrong she believed Carly was to keep baby Michael's paternity from AJ (Billy Warlock), or even her own mother keeping her away from her father the first 6 years of her life‚ÄîPatrick and Robin forgave one another and started the movement up again in their own relationship. Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted. Robin's mother comes back on a leave from her spy duties to help care for Robin until the birth of her grandchild. Patrick realizes what Robin and this baby truly mean to him and knows that he wants them to be a family in every sense of the word, but Robin still has concerns. Although Robin states that Patrick could see his child as much as he wants, she does not believe he is fully committed or prepared to give up his bachelorhood for a family. He takes her to court and only after his moving testimony does she realize Patrick truly wants this, her and their child, their family. They wait for their baby as a happy, loving committed couple. On August 12, 2008, Patrick and Robin learn their baby is a girl. As Patrick goes into full panicked father mode, Robin tries to calm him down. Later, when Patrick sees Robin with Jason, he expresses his concern that he does not want his child to be around such a dangerous target and Robin agrees. On August 21, 2008, Robin catches Patrick and Epiphany (Sonya Eddy) in some sort of cahoots against her. She thinks that they are conspiring to convince her to start her maternity leave early. She then goes to meet with a patient, when Patrick gets on the PA system and declares his love for Robin. Robin rushes to the nurses' station. Patrick proposes in front of all of their friends and other loved ones. While everyone is looking at Robin, she becomes so overwhelmed and leaves, leaving Patrick devastated. Patrick follows her to the park, where she is crying. She does not want him to marry her only because she is pregnant with his child, and although he states he wants to marry her for her, she still says no. She tells him that she loves him, but that she cannot marry him, and walks away, leaving Patrick heartbroken. Patrick continues to try to convince Robin to marry him to no avail. Robin has a health scare and goes into early labor. They manage to stop the labor and Patrick promises to stop pressuring her about getting married. In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on the same page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally accepted the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has all the time in the world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas. Just before their vows are exchanged, Robin's water breaks and she goes into labor. After having a complicated delivery, Robin delivers their daughter, Emma Grace Scorpio Drake. While there is an HIV scare involving a nick on baby Emma's ear, her tests come back negative. As soon as they receive the good news, Robin falls into a coma and is diagnosed with Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Robin regains consciousness a couple of days later to see Patrick holding Emma on the foot of the hospital bed. After she regains consciousness, Anna convinces her to keep fighting because Emma needs her mother. Robin & Patrick go home with the baby after she recovers. Once they get home, Robin becomes depressed believing Emma only cries with her. On Thanksgiving, Robin and Patrick set another wedding date for just after Christmas, not wanting their wedding to interfere with their daughter's first Christmas. =2009‚Äì12= Robert returns from Switzerland after his colon cancer's gone into remission, right before Christmas. Anna returns from a mission around the same time. This time, Robert walks his daughter down the aisle and Robin asks Anna to be her maid of honor (as opposed to Maxie who had the honors the first time). Patrick asks his brother, Dr. Matt Hunter, to be his best man (in place of Coleman who stood up for him last time). On December 26, the wedding goes off without a hitch. No shootings, no delays, no drama. Just love and romance and happiness. Unfortunately, Robin unknowingly suffers from postpartum depression (PPD). Robin's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and it takes a long time before Robin acknowledges that she has a problem. She starts seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication. But once she starts feeling better, Robin believes that she's cured and throws away her medication without her doctor's knowledge. Patrick finds out and stages an intervention where Robin's confronted by her doctor, family and friends. Robin finally admits that she needs more help and leaves home to get treatment at an inpatient facility. She returns once her treatment's completed and apologizes for what she's put Patrick through. Robin asks him if they can fix their relationship. Patrick assures her that she's the center of their family's life. He says that though what they've gone through is not going to be his favorite chapter of the 'Robin & Patrick saga', there's nothing to fix because what happened was beyond her control. They finally get a chance to really talk. Patrick reassures Robin of how invested he is in their life together. The two say \\"I love you\\" to each other and they go home together where Robin reunites with Emma with whom she can now bond. For a while, Robin's so attached to Emma that she actually contemplates not going back to work. Even Maxie notices and comments about how before Robin didn't even want to touch Emma, but now Patrick can't pry the baby out of her hands.Pants Optional. - General Hospital Daily Updates - Soaps.com But Robin's hard-earned happiness is interrupted when Patrick and his brother face a malpractice suit in the death of the mayor's mistress, Brianna Hughes, after an emergency surgery. Playing detective, Robin aids Patrick in proving that Brianna was murdered by the mayor's wife. Robin and Patrick host Thanksgiving dinner for the family at their new house. Though Patrick is initially kept in the dark, Robin plots with Kristina Davis (Lexi Ainsworth) and Molly Lansing (Haley Pullos) to set up their mother, Alexis Davis with Robin's Uncle Mac. Robin tells a skeptical Sam that the two guests of honor had very obvious chemistry at Maxie's \\"nonwedding\\" to Damian Spinelli (Bradford Anderson). But Alexis and Mac realize something is afoot and tell the girls it is a waste of time. Matt also attends the dinner, unexpectedly bringing along Dr. Lisa Niles (Brianna Brown), an ex-girlfriend of Patrick's who is town. Patrick gives her a warm hug and Robin, though surprised, tells Lisa she is welcome. Maxie, nursing influenza, misses the family event. Robin counsels Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst), who is having a secret affair with Nikolas Cassadine, but is engaged to Lucky Spencer (Jonathan Jackson), to be truthful about how she feels. In 2009 Patrick's former college girlfriend comes to town and the two strike up a flirtation; when Robin and Patrick start to have problems Robin begins to pull away from him. A few months later Robin decides to go to Africa despite Patrick's protestations. In July 2010 while Robin is in Africa, Patrick gets drunk with Lisa after a successful surgery and the two have a one-night stand; Patrick immediately feels guilty and realizes his love for Robin when she comes home from Africa a few days early. The trouble continues when Carly Corinthos Jacks overhears Patrick and Lisa talking about their one night stand and counsels Patrick to keep it secret from Robin. Matters go from bad to worse when Lisa begins exhibiting strange behavior and even breaks into Patrick and Robin's house and cuts her face out of their wedding picture. After being kidnapped by Lisa, Robin discovers Patrick's affair with Lisa and leaves him, completely heartbroken. However, when Lisa's obsession with Patrick spirals out of control to the extent where she attempts to murder Robin on several occasions, Robin and Patrick band together for Emma's sake to expose Lisa, and begin taking steps to repair their relationship. After the death of Jake Spencer, Robin apologizes for holding his betrayal against him for so long and asks him to come home so they can be a family again. On February 21, 2012, Robin Scorpio-Drake died in an explosion at the hospital. Staying true to her medical oath she went into the lab to retrieve the serum for Jason Morgan's protocol. Patrick watched helplessly as the lab exploded with his wife trapped inside. The first person he told was her mother Anna. On March 26, Patrick received what he thought was Robin ashes, and he took them to the plot of land that they were going to build their dream home on to say goodbye to Robin. Patrick was having a hard time saying goodbye, and the next scene showed Robin alive and unconscious in a hospital bed in an undisclosed location. =2013‚Äì14= Patrick then pursues a relationship with Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo). They grow closer and he proposes to her. On Patrick's wedding day to Sabrina, Robin shows up. Emma sees her and they have a big reunion. Eventually, Patrick chooses Robin and they reunite in time to celebrate Christmas as a family with Emma. Robin applies to be the chief of staff, but is overlooked, after Obrecht secures the position, following her own deal with the WSB. Patrick and Robin find out Sabrina's pregnant, but she claims that Patrick is not the baby's father. Sabrina later admits to Patrick that the baby really is his, and Patrick and Robin agree to deal with the situation together. Robin then gets a visit from Victor Cassadine (Thaao Penghlis), who reveals he's the WSB director who arranged Obrecht's release. He tells Robin he wants her to revive his sister-in-law and nephew, Helena (Constance Towers) and Stavros Cassadine (Robert Kelker-Kelly). After refusing to help Victor, he reveals that he has also been holding Jason, and that Robin could revive him as well, if she helped in resurrecting Helena and Stavros. After meeting Jason's son, Danny Morgan, Robin agrees to help Victor so she can also save Jason. She says goodbye to Mac, Anna, Patrick and Emma and leaves town with Victor. On August 5, 2014, Patrick runs into Robin at the Crichton-Clark Clinic. He was there with Sam, looking for answers on a former patient, Nina Clay (Michelle Stafford). Robin tells him that she can't leave the clinic. Patrick then see a cryogenic chamber, and he asks if Jason (Billy Miller) is in there. Robin says that it is Stavros, and that Jason is not there. She tells Patrick that Jason's organs were failing, and he soon died. Patrick then leaves after Robin says her work is more important then her family. Patrick soon files for divorce. It's revealed that Robin lied, and Jason is actually still alive. Victor threatened Robin into keeping quiet by having Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler) run Patrick's car off the road while he, Emma, and Sabrina were inside. Sabrina and Patrick's son, Gabriel, died as a result of the accident. Robin agrees to the divorce, despite being heartbroken. Robin manages to revive Jason, but Victor betrays her, and separates the two of them. However, Jason ends up escaping from his guards, and rescues Robin. The two escape from the clinic, and make their way to Port Charles. The two separate to find help, but Robin ends up getting kidnapped by Helena again. She threatens Robin's family, and forces her to leave again and develop an immortality serum. Robin tells Patrick she's in Paris, and leaves town again. =2015‚Äì17= Patrick begins a relationship with Sam, and they get engaged. However, when Jason, Sam's husband, is revealed to be alive, Patrick realizes that he and Sam will not make it, and ends their engagement. Emma is devastated over Sam leaving, and asks for her mother. Patrick calls Robin, now being held hostage by Jerry Jacks after Helena's death. Robin desperately wants to see Emma after hearing her upset, but she's forced to end the call. Emma still demands to see Robin, and Patrick decides takes Emma to Paris to see Robin. However, when he gets there, Robin is nowhere to be found. He calls Robert and Anna for help, and the three make their way to Cassadine Island, where they're able to rescue Robin. The two come back to Port Charles with Emma, and start to heal their relationship after Patrick finds out just how far Robin went to keep her family safe. Eventually, the two of them get job offers in Berkeley, California, and decide to move there. Emma insists that her parents re-marry before moving, and they agree. Patrick and Robin re-marry with their family present, then leave with Emma to begin their new lives. Robin and Emma make periodic trips back to Port Charles, mostly for special occasions and holidays. During Robin's latest trip back to town, she reveals to her mother that she and Patrick are expecting their second child. In July 2017, Patrick and Robin welcomed a son, Noah Robert Scorpio-Drake, named after his grandfathers Noah Drake and Robert Scorpio. Reception and impact Patrick and Robin became one of daytime's most popular pairings within a year of their debut. In 2007, TV Guide named them one of soap opera's best supercouples. Los Angeles Times described them as \\"one of the mother ship‚Äôs hottest new couples\\". In early 2007, with daytime soap operas \\"in peril\\" and \\"in need\\" of rescuing, SOAPnet, a Disney-owned cable channel, embarked on \\"a mission to revive the genre in the evening hours\\". Their goal was to lure new fans, as well as old, and increase the ratings and interest for daytime dramas. General Hospital: Night Shift, a spinoff of General Hospital, was launched to achieve this, with Patrick and Robin as their primary characters and love story.\\" \\"The show is being described as an episodic medical-mystery drama ‚Äì think equal parts General Hospital and House,\\" relayed Los Angeles Times. The move was considered \\"risky\\" by the network, but worth the risk. \\"We‚Äôre hoping to attract not just lapsed fans but viewers who aren‚Äôt hooked on a soap yet,\\" said Jill Farren Phelps, executive producer of the series and 20-year veteran producer. Of the decision to have the series focus on Patrick and Robin's romance, Ed Martin of the Jack Myers Report stated, \\"...it‚Äôs a real treat to see two characters of such historical importance to General Hospital be allowed to grow.\\" Daniel R. Coleridge, former TV Guide columnist and author of The Q Guide to Soap Operas, said that power pairs like Patrick and Robin are precisely what is missing from the daytime genre. \\"What soaps lack isn‚Äôt slapping or catfights. It‚Äôs romance,\\" he said. \\"Soaps are really devoid of good romance. There are no supercouples anymore.\\" In October 2008, Soaps In Depth named Patrick and Robin one of soap opera's 100 greatest couples. In December 2008, soap opera website Daytime Confidential named Patrick and Robin the #1 couple for 2008. Also, soapoperasource named them \\"Best Couple of 2008\\" and SOAPnet named their wedding as \\"Best GH Wedding\\" of 2008. On Tuesday October 12, 2010, David Letterman named Patrick as #9 on President Barack Obama's Top Ten Enemies List for his affair with Lisa Niles.

Dropfront Desk, ca. 1903. Brooklyn Museum Mission furniture is a style of furniture that originated in the late 19th century. It traces its origins to a chair made by A.J. Forbes around 1894 for San Francisco's Swedenborgian Church. The term mission furniture was first popularized by Joseph P. McHugh of New York, a furniture manufacturer and retailer who copied these chairs and offered a line of stylistically related furnishings by 1898. The word mission references the Spanish missions throughout colonial California, though the design of most Mission Style furniture owed little to the original furnishings of these missions. The style became increasingly popular following the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo. The style was popularly associated with the American Arts and Crafts movement.Munson- Williams-Proctor Institute (1993). \\"The Distinction of Being Different\\" Joseph P. McHugh and the American Arts and Crafts Movement Design philosophy Mission style is a design that emphasizes simple horizontal and vertical lines and flat panels that accentuate the grain of the wood (often oak, especially quartersawn white oak). People were looking for relief after the excesses of Victorian times and the influx of mass-produced furniture from the Industrial Revolution. The furniture maker Gustav Stickley produced Arts and Crafts furniture often referred to as being in the Mission Style, though Stickley dismissed the term as misleading. This was plain oak furniture that was upright, solid, and suggestive of entirely handcrafted work, though in the case of Stickley and his competitors, was constructed within a factory by both machine and handworking techniques. New trends in furniture products continue to charm consumers. Each season brings with itself new designs, eye soothing pleasant colors, and overstuffed and pampered shapes. Along with a superior design and increased functionality, these furniture products, specially the mission style recliner chair, continue to move to new levels of technology meeting and satisfying the requirements of consumers and businesses who increasingly spend more than normal time on their work stations. https://www.hod9.com/mission-style-recliner-chair/ A Starr mission style piano (illustrated in 1906) Influential people and companies Many designers and companies played an important role in the development of the design over the years.

They belonged to the broad group Temnospondyli, a successful and diverse collection of semiaquatic tetrapods which modern amphibians are probably descended from. Rhinesuchids can be differentiated from other temnospondyls by details of their skulls, most notably the interior structure of their otic notches at the back of the skull. They were among the earliest- diverging members of the Stereospondyli, a subgroup of temnospondyls with flat heads and aquatic habits. Although more advanced stereospondyls evolved to reach worldwide distribution in the Triassic period, rhinesuchids primarily lived in the high-latitude environments of Gondwana (what is now South America and Africa) during the Guadalupian and Lopingian epochs of the Permian. The taxonomy of this family has been convoluted, with more than twenty species having been named in the past; a 2017 review recognized only eight of them (distributed among seven genera) to be valid. While several purported members of this group have been reported to have lived in the Triassic period, most are either dubious or do not belong to the group. However, at least one valid genus of rhinesuchid is known from the early Triassic, a small member known as Broomistega. The most recent formal definition of Rhinesuchidae, advocated by Mariscano et al. (2017) is that of a stem-based clade containing all taxa more closely related to Rhinesuchus whaitsi than to Lydekkerina huxleyi or Peltobatrachus pustulatus. A similar alternate definition is that Rhinesuchidae is a stem-based clade containing all taxa more closely related to Uranocentrodon senekalensis than to Lydekkerina huxleyi, Trematosaurus brauni, or Mastodonsaurus giganteus.  Description  Rhinesuchids generally had a conventional body type for tetrapods, with four limbs and a moderately long tail. In addition, their bodies were also somewhat elongated and their limbs were small and weak but still rather well-developed. Some were very large, up to 3 meters (10 feet) in length. Like most stereospondyls, their skulls were flattened and triangular, with upward-pointing eyes. Most rhinesuchids had relatively short snouts, although the snout of Australerpeton was very long and thin. The only other giant long-snouted Permian amphibians were members of the family Archegosauridae, such as Prionosuchus and Konzhukovia. = Otic notch = The skull of Uranocentrodon, with the otic region expanded to show rhinesuchid otic features. Like most ancient amphibians, rhinesuchids had a pair of indentations at the rear edge of the skull known as otic notches. While sometimes considered to have housed hearing organs such as a tympanum (eardrum), these notches are more likely to have held spiracles, fleshy holes used for breathing. Rhinesuchids can be characterized by a unique system of ridges and grooves within the inner cavity of each otic notch. The walls of the otic notch cavity (sometimes referred to as a tympanic cavity) are mainly made up of the ascending branch of the pterygoid bones. Nevertheless, the inside edge of each cavity is formed by a tabular bone. The tabular bones are a pair of triangular bones along the rear edge of the skull which form pointed structures known as tabular horns. The upper part of the outer wall of the cavity is also formed partly from the squamosal bones, which mostly occupy the flat upper face of the skull. The portion of the squamosal which forms the cavity wall is separated by the portion outside of the cavity by a pronounced boundary known as a falciform crest. The outer wall of the cavity has a long and pronounced groove, known as a stapedial groove, which extends lengthwise along the wall. The lower edge of the groove is formed by a ridge/crest known as an oblique ridge, although it has also been called a crista obliqua, otic flange, or simply an oblique crest. The upper edge of the stapedial groove is formed by another ridge/crest bordering the squamosal bone, which Eltink et al. (2016) named the 'dorsal pterygoid crest'. However, Mariscano et al. (2017) preferred to use the name \\"lamella\\" for this structure so that it would not be confused with a different ridge present in lydekkerinids, which is sometimes termed an 'oblique crest of the pterygoid', but more commonly called a 'tympanic crest'. Confusingly enough, many rhinesuchids are also known to possess a tympanic crest. This ridge was positioned further back than the other ridges (near the intersection of the pterygoid, quadrate, and squamosal bones) and extends down along the rear face of the cheek. The inner edge of the outer wall of the cavity was formed by a ledge which most studies simply label 'membrane'. This convention exists as a result of the old and likely incorrect hypothesis that otic notches housed eardrums. Under this hypothesis, the inner ledge may have attached to a membrane stretching along the inner cavity of the ear. This combination of otic cavity grooves and ridges is unique to rhinesuchids. The lamella and stapedial groove are unknown in any other groups, although they are present in practically every rhinesuchid (except Broomistega, which lacks a lamella). The tympanic crest is present in most rhinesuchids but absent in a few, and it is additionally present in lydekkerinids. The oblique ridge/crest and falciform crest are present in most other sterospondyls (although the former is less well-developed), while the 'membrane' ledge is present in practically every stereospondylomorph. = Palate and braincase = Various bones and openings comprised the palate (roof of the mouth) in rhinesuchids, as in other amphibians. At the tip of the palate lied the vomers, while the areas near the edge of the mouth were made of the palatine and ectopterygoid bones. In the middle of the rear part of the mouth was a rectangular bone known as a parasphenoid. Most of the parasphenoid formed the lower face of the flattened braincase, although it also possesses a thin forward-projecting rod known as a cultriform process, which extends down the midline of the skull to meet the vomers. Towards the back of the mouth, there were the multi-pronged pterygoid bones on each side of the skull. Each pterygoid had several branches, including the posterior branch which stretches back and to the side of the skull, the short medial branch which extends inwards and connects to the parasphenoid bone, an ascending branch which projects upwards to form the otic notch, and finally the anterior branch which extends forward along the palatine and ectopterygoid. The pterygoids of most rhinesuchids have very long anterior branches. In most members of this family, the anterior branch reaches as far forward as the vomers, although Australerpeton has relatively short anterior branches.A pair of large openings, known as interpterygoid vacuities, fill the areas between these bones, making the majority of the palate open space. When seen from behind, the upper branches of the braincase (paroccipital processes) extends from side to side, partially concealing the ascending branch of the pterygoids. Each paroccipital process is also perforated by a small hole, known as post-temporal fenestrae. These holes are very thin in rhinesuchids. Above these paroccipital processes lie the otic notches as well as the tabular bones. The paroccipital processes also point backwards to some extent, forming horns which in some rhinesuchids are slightly longer than those of the tabulars. When seen from below, the most prominent portion of the braincase is the parasphenoid bone. The rear corners of the parasphenoid have small 'pockets' bordered by ridges (known as crista muscularis). These ridges may have anchored muscles capable of maneuvering the head on the neck. = Other skull and jaw features = Many bones made up the upper side of the skull, although a particular pair of bones acquired a specific design in rhinesuchids. These bones were the elongated jugal and prefrontal bones, which formed the front edge of the orbits (eye holes). In most rhinesuchids, the edge between the two bones possessed a 'stepped' shape, with a triangular outer extension of the prefrontal pushing the suture with the jugal towards a more lateral (outwards) position. However, the suture is more straight in Australerpeton, like in other stereospondyls. The lower jaw has a pair of holes only visible from the inside edge of the jaw. The larger hole at the rear part of the bone complex, known as a posterior Meckelian foramen, was thin and elongated in rhinesuchids. An additional hole on the underside of the jaw joint is only visible from below. This hole, the chorda tympanic foramen, was large in this family. On the upper side of the jaw joint, a thin groove known as an arcadian groove stretches towards the lingual (tongue) side of the jaw and separates other bony bumps located among the jaw joint. As a whole, the grooves and ridges of the jaw joint were poorly developed in rhinesuchids compared to that of many other stereospondyl groups, instead resembling the simple joint of archegosaurids such as Melosaurus.  Paleobiology  Most rhinesuchids are only known from skull material, although a few members of the group (Uranocentrodon, Broomistega, and Australerpeton, for example) include specimens preserving a significant portion of the rest of the skeleton. A juvenile specimen of Broomistega had ankles and vertebrae which were poorly ossified, indicating that its joints had a large amount of cartilaginous material to supplement the low amount of bone. This trait is often correlated with an aquatic lifestyle. Features of the skull, such as upwards-pointing eyes, also support this hypothesis.Broomistega (green) preserved in a fossilized burrow with Thrinaxodon (brown)Despite this support for an aquatic lifestyle, other pieces of evidence show that rhinesuchids were capable of some terrestrial movement. Although rhinesuchids did not possess any adaptations for digging, the poorly-ossified juvenile specimen of Broomistega was found in a flooded burrow which was also inhabited by a Thrinaxodon. Various conditions of the way these animals were preserved indicate that they co-inhabited the burrow peacefully, likely to survive a drought by aestivating (staying in a dormant state during hot and dry conditions). The fact that a Broomistega was able to enter the burrow of a terrestrial animal such as Thrinaxodon indicates that rhinesuchids were not exclusively aquatic. In addition, it has been noted that larger temnospondyls generally have more well-ossified joints. For example, large specimens of Australerpeton possessed robust hips, several completely bony ankle bones, and ossified pleurocentra (part of the vertebrae). Nevertheless, these skeletons were not as strongly built as those of Eryops (a supposedly terrestrial temnospondyl), with smaller shoulder girdles and less prominent sites for muscle attachment. Dias & Schultz (2003) suggested that the lifestyle of Australerpeton (and presumably other rhinesuchids) was that of a semiaquatic piscivore (fish-eater), preferring to hunt in shallow bodies of freshwater yet retaining the ability to walk on land during droughts. A Histological study of several indeterminate rhinesuchid fossils (referred to Rhinesuchus) indicate that members of the family grew seasonally, as in modern amphibians. Individuals also had fairly long life span, with one specimen being 30 to 35 years old at the time of its death based on the number of lines of arrested growth (rings in the bone used to tell age, like tree rings) present in a hip fragment. Some lines of arrested growth were very narrow, indicating that the individuals could reduce their growth and metabolism during times of hardship. This ability may be the reason why rhinesuchids were rather successful at the end of the Permian, as well as how a few small members of the group survived the Permian-Triassic extinction event. = Gills = Three rows of tiny bones (branchial ossicles) covered with thin tooth-like structures (branchial denticles) have been preserved near the neck of one specimen of Uranocentrodon. These bones almost certainly attached to the branchial arches of gills while the animal was alive. Although such bones are rare among stereospondyls and unknown in any other rhinesuchids, this may simply be due to the fact that the bones of other genera were preserved in more rough- grained sediments where such delicate bones could be broken or difficult to find. Although evidently Uranocentrodon had gills of some kind, it is difficult to determine what kind of gills they were. On the one hand, they could have been internal gills like those of fish, which were hardly visible from the outside of the body. On the other hand, they could have been stalk- like external gills like those of modern salamander larvae or even neotenic adult salamanders such as the mudpuppy or axolotl. External gills had to have evolved from internal gills sometime during amphibian evolution, although the precise location of this transition is controversial. The gill-supporting bones preserved in ancient amphibians show many similarities with those of fish gills and salamander gills. Paleontologists who prefer comparing ancient tetrapods to modern amphibians generally find many similarities between the fossil bones and modern salamander gill bones. On the other hand, paleontologists who compare fossil tetrapods to fossil fish consider the bones to correlate with internal gills. This conundrum, known as Bystrow's paradox, has made it difficult to assess gills in ancient amphibians such as Uranocentrodon, as different paleontologists come to different conclusions based on their field of study. Uranocentrodon, a very large member of the family which possessed gills and body armor Bystrow's paradox was finally resolved by a 2010 study, which found that grooved ceratobrachnial structures (components of the branchial arches) are correlated with internal gills. Ancient tetrapods which preserved grooved ceratobranchials, such as the dvinosaur Dvinosaurus, probably only had internal gills as adults. Nevertheless, external gills have been directly preserved as soft tissue in some temnospondyls. However, these situations only occur in larval specimens or members of specialized groups such as the branchiosaurids. One living species of lungfish (Lepidosiren) has external gills as larvae which transform into internal gills as adults. Despite adult dvinosaur specimens having skeletal features correlated with internal gills, some larval specimens of another dvinosaur, Isodectes preserved soft tissue external gills. Thus, the gill development of dvinosaurs (and presumably other temnospondyls, such as Uranocentrodon) mirrored that of Lepidosiren. Despite this feature likely being an example of convergent evolution (as other lungfish exclusively possessed internal gills), it still remains a useful gauge for how temnospondyl gills developed. The study's writers concluded that the gills of temnospondyls (including Uranocentrodon and other rhinesuchids which may have possessed gills) were probably internal (like those of a fish) as an adult, but external (like those of a salamander) as a larva. = Body armor = One Uranocentrodon skeleton also preserved large patches of bony scutes or scales around the body. The scutes which would have been on the belly of the animal were arranged in parallel diagonal rows which converged at the midline of the body and diverged as the rows stretched towards the tail. Each scute had a ridge running down the middle, and the scutes further towards the midline overlapped the ones further out. Along the midline, a row of flat and wide scales stretched from the throat to the tail. While these belly scales were made of bone, scales on other parts of the body had less bone structure and were probably made of keratin instead. The scales on the sides of the body were flatter and smaller than the bony belly scutes. The scutes on the back of the body were similar, although more rounded in shape, with a few larger scutes near the midline. The scales of the hind limbs and the underside of the hip region were similar to those of the back, although no integument was preserved on the forelimbs or tail. Thus, it is likely that at least the tail was unarmored and only covered with naked skin. Scales have also been preserved in Australerpeton specimens. They are similar in distribution to those of Uranocentrodon, but are generally rounder in shape. They also possessed a honeycomb-like internal structure and histological features which indicate that they were deeply embedded in skin. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would have been visible from the outside of the body. It cannot be determined whether the scales or scutes of rhinesuchids would have enabled or restricted cutaneous respiration (breathing through the skin as in modern amphibians). Other potential applications of the scales included protection against predators, retaining water during droughts, and possibly even for storing calcium when conditions are harsh (a technique used by female African crocodiles).This last hypothesis is the least likely, as rhinesuchids did not lay hard-shelled eggs, which is the reason female crocodiles need to store calcium.  Classification  When the family was first named in 1919, Rhinesuchidae was already recognized as a group of basal stereospondyls, a position which it retains even in the present day. Among the traits used to support this position include the fact that most rhinesuchids had long anterior branches of their pterygoids. More advanced stereospondyls had shorter anterior branches. In 1947, Alfred Romer placed the family (which he believed only included Rhinesuchus) in a broad superfamily which he called Rhinesuchoidea. Rhinesuchoidea was intended to be part of an evolutionary grade of temnospondyls linking \\"primitive\\" rhachitomes such as Eryops to \\"advanced\\" stereospondyls such as metoposaurs and trematosaurs. This grade, termed \\"neorhachitomes\\", was separated into Capitosauroidea (which contained capitosaurs and \\"benthosuchids\\") and Rhinesuchoidea. Apart from containing Rhinesuchidae, Rhinesuchoidea also contained various genera as well as the families Lydekkerinidae, Sclerothoracidae, and finally Uranocentrodontidae. Romer felt that certain taxa (i.e. Uranocentrodon and the possibly synonymous dubious genus \\"Laccocephalus\\") often considered rhinesuchids were best placed in the separate family Uranocentrodontidae, while others (i.e. Rhinesuchoides) were not placed in any rhinesuchoid family in particular. Other families were later placed in this Rhinesuchoidea, such as Rhinecepidae in 1966 and Australerpetonidae in 1998. Australerpeton, a long-snouted putative member of the family The arrival of cladistics in the late 20th century has caused grades to fall out of favor in recent years, replaced by clades, which are defined by close relations rather than ancestral assemblages. However, the basic idea behind Rhinesuchoidea, which states that advanced stereospondyls descended from animals similar to rhinesuchids, is still considered valid. Rhinecepidae and Uranocentrodontidae were found to be synonymous with Rhinesuchidae according to a 2000 analysis by Schoch and Milner. One study placed Rhinesuchidae within the superfamily Capitosauroidea. However, this interpretation has not been followed by other studies which consider rhinesuchids to be more basal than capitosaurs. Australerpetonidae, a monotypic family only containing the genus Australerpeton, has been more difficult to compare to Rhinesuchidae. Some studies place Australerpeton as a basal stereospondyl outside of Rhinesuchidae, while others consider it an archegosaurid outside of Stereospondyli entirely. A comprehensive review of Australerpeton published by Eltink et al. (2016) favored the hypothesis that it was deeply nested within Rhinesuchidae. A phylogenetic study performed as part of the study split the family into two clades. One clade was a subfamily termed Rhinesuchinae. Rhinesuchinae contains Rhinesuchus and Rhineceps. This subfamily is mainly characterized by features of the palate, such as an anterior branch of the pterygoid lacking ridges and palatine bones covered in tiny denticles. The other main clade of the family contained Uranocentrodon as well as another subfamily termed Australerpetinae. This clade is united by the presence of a tympanic crest and a foramen magnum (the hole for the spinal cord at the back of the braincase) which has a curved upper edge. Australerpetinae is a modified version of Australerpetonidae which has been reduced to subfamily status in order to fit within Rhinesuchidae. This subfamily contains Australerpeton, Broomistega, Laccosaurus, and Rhinesuchoides. Members of this subfamily had somewhat longer and more tapered snouts than other Rhinesuchids, although (according to Eltink et al..) their pterygoids had short anterior branches, letting the palatine bones contact the interpterygoid vacuities. The most parsimonious (evolutionarily simplest) tree found by Eltink et al. (2016) is seen below: The structure of Rhinesuchidae following Eltink et al.'s study was challenged by a different study on rhinesuchids published less than a year later. This study, Mariscano et al.. (2017), agreed that Australerpeton was a rhinesuchid, but considered it the most basal member of the family. They disagree with Eltink et al.'s recognition of short anterior pterygoid branches in multiple genera. According to their analysis, only Australerpeton possessed this trait, the main feature which separates it from the rest of Rhinesuchidae. Other traits which support this separation include the fact that other rhinesuchids have stepped jugal- prefrontal contact and toothless coronoid bones in the lower jaw. The rest of the family was poorly resolved in their phylogenetic analysis, although three clades did have moderate Bremer support values of 2. Bremer support is gauged by counting the number of times analyzed traits are acquired, lost, or reacquired within a family tree. Some family trees include more of these transitions than others, meaning that some possible trees assumed that more than the bare minimum amount of evolution had taken place. The family tree with the least amount of these 'steps' (transitions) is likely to be the most accurate, based on the principal of occam's razor (the simplest answer is the most accurate). Bremer support is used to label how well-supported clades are by analyzing how they are distributed among more complex alternatives to the simplest (most parsimonious) tree. Clades which do not exist in a family tree which is only one total step more complex than the MPT (most parsimonious tree) have a Bremer support of 1, meaning that the clade's existence is very uncertain. Even if the MPT of the present analysis supports their existence, new data may make a competing family tree more parsimonious, dissolving clades which are only supported in the current MPT. Other clades may have much higher Bremer support values, indicating that more drastic assumptions have to be formulated to render the clade invalid. Rhinesuchidae as a whole, for example, has a Bremer support of 6 in Mariscano et al. (2017), which is considered high support. A Bremer support of 2, as is the case with three specific clades in this analysis, is considered moderate. One of these clades included the two valid species of Rhinesuchoides, while another clade connected Rhineceps and Uranocentrodon, and the last contained Rhinesuchus and Laccosaurus. The arrangement of these clades (as well as the placement of Broomistega) could not be resolved with absolute confidence, with Bremer support values of only 1 regardless of where the three clades were placed among non-Australerpeton Rhinesuchidae.

During the Triassic, lydekkerinids had a global distribution. They were small-bodied with wedge-shaped, roughly triangular heads. Fossils have been found in Russia, Greenland, India, South Africa, Madagascar, and Australia. The type genus is Lydekkerina, the namesake of the family and the most well-known lydekkerinid. Lydekkerinids have a distinguishing combination of characteristics. Synapomorphies, or unique characteristics, include a step- shaped contact between the nasal and prefrontal bones, indented lateral margins of the interpterygoid vacuities (two large holes in the palate), and straight cheek margins when the skull is viewed from behind. Other characteristics include frontal bones that do not touch the rims of the eye sockets and ridges on the pterygoid bones. Sensory sulci (canals running along the surface of the skull) are present in many temnospondyls but are hardly visible on lydekkerinid skulls. The infraorbital sulcus, a canal that runs below the eyes and nostrils, has a distinctive bend along its length. Small bumps called denticles cover much of the palate. Lydekkerinids are usually classified as basal stereospondyls. Schoch and Milner (2000) placed them in the clade Rhytidostea along with brachyopoids and rhytidosteids. Some phylogenetic studies of lydekkerinids have found them to be polyphyletic. These studies include the traditionally lydekkerinid taxa Lydekkerina and Luzocephalus, and sometimes Deltacephalus. Luzocephalus has been found to be more closely related to a family called Trematosauridae, while Lydekkerina remains in a basal position among stereospondyls. Yates and Warren (2000) found Lydekkerina to be a basal member of the stereospondyl clade Capitosauria, while Luzocephalus fell within a second stereospondyl clade called Trematosauria.

It is an Indo-Pacific species of reefs. Appearance They are a medium-sized anthias reaching a maximum of 5in/12 cm at adulthood. This species is sexually dimorphic, meaning the males and females have differing physical characteristics. Pseudanthias bimaculatus males are primarily red with jagged pink lines along the body. Males will have a red tail with clear to white tips. Males will typically have yellow highlights on the tail, anal fins, and head area. Males also have one or two spots on their dorsal fin, hence the scientific name 'bimaculatus', meaning two spots. Females will be primarily pink with yellow fins and tail. Females will typically have a yellow line stretching across the head through their eyes. Diet Pseudanthias bimaculatus are primarily carnivorous. The diet composing mainly of zooplankton and floating filamentous algae in the wild. In the aquarium, a varied diet of mysis shrimp, vitamin-enriched brine shrimp, frozen preparations and other meaty items for zooplankton feeders. Multiple small feedings throughout the day are recommended for this species. Range It is found in various reefs of ranging in the Indo-West Pacific from East Africa, Maldives, and Indonesia. It is a deep water species typically found in coastal drop-offs. In the Aquarium Pseudanthias bimaculatus do well when kept in an aquarium over 70 gallons. It is a deep water species that seems to do well when several hiding places are made available. It is considered a moderately difficult fish to care for and reef compatible. Like other anthias species, Pseudanthias bimaculatus share the trait of being hermaphroditic. If a dominant male perishes, the largest female of the group will often morph to take its place. They are peaceful aquarium inhabitants and will rarely bother their tankmates. The only exception seems to be males of the same species. This species may also be aggressive to other anthiae species. They are generally considered safe with any invertebrates. Possible tankmates include clownfish, blennies, gobies, Chromis, and butterflyfish.

A new species of Metoposaurus from the Late Triassic of Portugal and comments on the systematics and biogeography of metoposaurid temnospondyls. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. e912988., 2015: Metoposaurids can be distinguished from the very similar mastodonsauroids by the position of their eyes, placed far forward on the snout. Taphonomy Several mass accumulations of metoposaurid fossils are known from the southwestern United States and Morocco. These have often been interpreted as the result of mass deaths from droughts. Many individuals would have died in one area, creating a dense bone bed once fossilized. These mass accumulations of metoposaurids are often dominated by one taxa, such as Anaschisma or Metoposaurus. Recent sedimentological studies suggest that the mass accumulations were not the result of droughts, but of river currents carrying remains. Most skeletons in these accumulations are disarticulated, suggesting they were transported by water to the deposition sites. The large gatherings of metoposaurids may have been breeding sites, and were probably common across floodplains in Late Triassic Pangaea.

A teen driver must meet the new requirements to obtain a Georgia driver‚Äôs license. The law was named after Joshua Brown, who died in an accident in 2003. Joshua‚Äôs parents joined with legislators in an effort to put stronger driver training laws into effect. The end result was The Teenage and Adult Driver Responsibility Act (TADRA), a law that requires teens get specific driving experience and instruction before obtaining licensing beyond the learner's permit. The law also implemented a graduated driver licensing system, imposing time-of-day and passenger restrictions on drivers aged 16 and 17. Licensing procedure TADRA, enacted on July 1, 1997, necessitates a graduated three step driver licensing procedure for Georgia teens between the ages of 15 and 18. There are three separate classifications for teen driver licensing. Joshua‚Äôs Law, which went into effect January 1, 2007, added an additional educational requirement to the second step. Step 1, the Learner's permit (Class CP license). Can operate a Class C vehicle when accompanied by a person at least 21 years of age who is licensed to drive a class C vehicle, who is fit and capable of exercising control over the vehicle, and who is occupying a seat beside the driver. Step 2, the Intermediate license (Class D license). Drivers are 16 years of age, who have held an Instructional Permit for 12 months and 1 day and passed the state-administered comprehensive on-road driving test are eligible for this license. There are several restrictions on this license, which are: *No driving between the hours of 12am and 5am. *For the first six months, the only passengers allowed in the vehicle are immediate family members. *For the second six months the driver is allowed to carry passengers who are not immediate family members, as long as no more than one of those passengers is under 21 years of age. *After the second six months the driver is allowed up to three such passengers (persons under 21 who are not members of the driver's immediate family). *Joshua's Law - On or after January 1, 2007, any 16 year old who obtains an initial Class D license must have completed: ** a driver education course approved by the Department of Driver Services and ** a cumulative total of at least forty (40) hours of other supervised driving experience, including at least six (6) hours at night. Step 3, the Full license (Class C license). The Class C license is granted to drivers ages 18 years and older who have a class D license and have no major traffic convictions during the previous 12 months. Major traffic violations are as follows: *DUI *Eluding a police officer *Drag racing *Reckless driving *Hit and run *Any violation that assesses four or more points on the driver's license Other provisions Joshua's Law also implemented additional fees on certain traffic offenses such as DUIs. The program raises approximately $2 to $4 million per year in revenue for the State of Georgia.

Welded sculpture (related to visual art and works of art) is an art form in which sculpture is made using welding techniques. History Anthony Caro, Black Cover Flat, 1974 The Catalan artist Julio Gonz√°lez is credited as one of the earliest developers of welded sculpture. Gonz√°lez came from a line of metalsmith workers; his grandfather was a goldsmith in Galicia, who established in the Catalan capital in the early 19th century. Gonz√°lez's father, Concordio Gonz√°lez, owned a workshop and as a young boy, Gonz√°lez learned from him the techniques of gold, silver, and iron metalwork. He is associated with the Spanish circle of artists of Montmartre, including Pablo Gargallo, Juan Gris and Max Jacob. In 1918, he developed an interest in the artistic possibilities of welding, after learning the technique whilst working in the Renault Factory at Boulogne-Billancourt. This technique would subsequently become his principal contribution to sculpture, though during this period he also painted and ‚Äîespecially‚Äî created jewellery pieces. In 1920 he renewed his acquaintance with Pablo Picasso, for whom he later provided technical assistance in executing sculptures in iron, participating to Picasso's researches on analytic cubism. He also forged the infrastructures of Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi's plasters. In the winter of 1927-28, he showed Picasso how to use oxy-fuel welding and cutting. When their friendship re-established itself, Picasso and Gonz√°lez collaborated on a piece called \\"Woman in the Garden\\" between 1928-1930. From October 1928 till 1932, both men worked together. Influenced by Picasso, the fifty-year-old Gonz√°lez changed his style, exchanging bronze for iron, and volumes for lines. Gonz√°lez began to formalize a new visual language in sculpture that would change the course of his career.Le Monde, Julio Gonzalez, la r√©volution du fer, 4 July 2007 Andrew French, Ryan McCourt, and Robert Willms. Welding was increasingly used in sculpture from the 1930s as new industrial processes such as arc welding were adapted to aesthetic purposes.Welded Sculpture of the Twentieth Century, Judy K.Van Wagner Collischan, Lund Humphries, 2000 Welding techniques, including digital cutting, can be used to cut and join metal. Welded sculptures are sometimes site-specific. Artist Richard Hunt said \\"The idea of exploiting welding methods and the tensile strength of metals opened up many possibilities to me. This idea was actually linked to the increasing recognition among artists that an art which was representative of our own time ought to use materials and techniques that were at hand, whether it was new experiments using plastics, new kinds of paints, new kinds of surfaces in painting, or using materials developed during the war effort.\\"\\" Associated Artists * Ale≈° Vesel√Ω * Alexander Calder * Andrew French * Anthony Caro * Antoine Pevsner * Beverly Pepper * Bruce Gray * Charles Ginnever * David Smith * James Rosati * John Raymond Henry * Julio Gonz√°lez * Ken Macklin * Kevin Caron * Lyman Kipp * Nancy Graves * Pablo Gargallo * Pablo Picasso * Peter Hide * Peter Reginato * Revs * Richard Serra * Richard Hunt * Robert H.

The hotel contained around 200 guest bedrooms and hosted many famous guests, including the Beatles and the Rolling Stones in the 1960s. The hotel was taken over by the British Army in 1972 for use as a military base from which to patrol the city centre during the height of the Troubles. The troops based there were protected by anti-rocket screens constructed around the front of the building on the main street to repel everything from bricks and bottles to paint and blast bombs. One of the most bombarded hotels in the world, it was attacked more than 150 times by the Provisional IRA and other groups. In the late 1980s, the hotel was no longer required as a military base.

Typical performance is how an employee performs on a regular basis, while maximum performance is how one performs when exerting as much effort as possible. Workers usually exhibit maximum performance when they are being observed. Therefore, some conditions that tend to foster maximum performance include work samples (often given to a potential employee during an interview), manager evaluations, and job knowledge tests. The results from these situations are the ones that are most accessible to supervisors; however, they are usually not reflected in an employee's typical, or day-to-day, performance. This dichotomy makes it harder for managers to have an accurate picture of how an employee will typically act on the job. Therefore, an example of the importance of this distinction can be seen when a manager hires an employee based on high performance during an interview; the manager is essentially hiring the employee based on viewing their maximum performance, which may not be representative of their typical performance. Additionally, this distinction has led some organizations to take measures to get their employees to perform at their maximum level more often. Characteristics Psychological tests are broadly divided by the British Psychological Society into the following two types. #Test of typical performance. In this case, an individual's performance is assessed according to a given situation. Answers are not right or wrong, but identify choices, preferences and strengths of feeling. #Test of maximum performance: These assess the individual's ability to perform effectively under standard conditions. Performance on these tests, which includes ability and aptitude tests, can be judged as right or wrong. Ability tests come in many different forms and may test a general intellectual functioning or a specific ability.Laurie J Mullins, Management and organisation behaviour, 8th ed, Prentice Hall p. 140. Both typical and maximum performances are characterized by different conditions. Managers and organizations should be aware of these so that they are able to identify whether an employee is performing at a typical or maximum level. Sackett, Zedeck, and Fogli, the researchers who first studied the typical/maximum distinction in 1988, proposed that several conditions must be present for maximum performance to occur: :a. the individual must be aware that they are being observed; :b. the individual must be instructed to maximize their effort; and :c. the measure of performance must occur over a short period of time so that the individual can remain focused on the appropriate goal. Alternatively, typical performance would occur in situations where the individual is not aware of evaluation, is not consciously attempting their best performance, and is monitored over a long period of time. More recently, Sackett elaborated on the definition of maximum performance, saying that one can view it as the level of performance an employee can \\"produce on demand\\" if exerting maximum effort for a short period of time. This means that maximum performance cannot be due purely to luck or chance. As an example, he says that when concentrating, he could make 7 of 10 free throws. But, if he has a hot streak and makes 10 baskets in a row, this wouldn't be maximum performance because it was probably just due to luck. =Original findings= The original research on typical and maximum performance studied supermarket employees scanning items at a cash register. Typical performance was determined by the average number of items scanned and the number of voids per shift. Maximum performance was calculated according to the speed and accuracy of several timed observation periods. The researchers found that those two measures were not statistically related, suggesting that typical and maximum performance are actually distinct categorizations. Confirming research Continued support has been found for the typical vs. maximum performance distinction since the initial supermarket study. In one study looking at antecedents of the two types of performance, statistical analyses revealed that typical and maximum performance are conceptually different variables. In addition, other studies have revealed that typical and maximum performances do not share the same antecedents, which suggests that these are two separate forms of performance. Components Job performance is viewed as an employee's results, determined by their combined intelligence and motivation. Since motivation is dependent on an individual's choices, one can control the direction, level, and persistence they put into a task. Intelligence, however, is stable and not under personal control. =Motivation and intelligence= All tasks require some form of ability and motivation;Campbell, J.P. (1990). Modeling the performance prediction problem in industrial and organizational psychology. In M.D. Dunnette & L.M. Hough (Eds.). Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology (Vol. 1, 2nd ed., pp. 687‚Äì732). Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press. however, Sackett and colleagues hypothesized that the difference between typical and maximum performance is determined by a combination of these two factors. They expected that maximum performance is primarily determined by the intelligence of an individual. Since maximum performance occurs when the individual is highly motivated to perform well, the impact of intelligence is higher under these conditions. Everyone under this condition would be exerting the maximum amount, so the difference between individuals lies in their ability. In typical performance, both intelligence and motivation are thought to influence the quality of an employee's job performance. However, motivation is believed to be the more influential factor in this situation. Research has investigated the strength of these original theories driving typical and maximum performance. A recent study confirmed Sackett and colleagues' ideas, finding that maximum performance was related to the employee's knowledge of the job (e.g., intelligence), while typical performance was related to persistence, self-efficacy, and other measures of motivation. Antecedents Because maximum performance can be misleading, it is important for managers to be able to recognize the antecedents of both maximum and typical performances. This can further allow them to recognize when they are most likely to observe either type of performance. =Intelligence= Since all individuals in a maximum performance situation are expected to have similarly high levels of motivation, the differences in their performance should be primarily based on the differing ability of each person. Following these thoughts, researchers have hypothesized that intelligence would be predictive of maximum performance. A few studies have supported this thought, finding that intelligence is more highly related with maximum performance than it is typical performance. =Personality= Researchers have hypothesized that typical performance would be predicted by personality factors, since much of the variability in this type of performance is controlled by an individual and their exertion of effort. Specifically, neuroticism and conscientiousness have been believed to be the personality factors that contribute to motivation, since neuroticism is related to self-esteem and confidence, and conscientiousness is related to perseverance and desire to achieve. This idea has received mixed results in the research. A study by Ployhart and colleagues found that the personality factors of neuroticism and extroversion significantly predicted typical performance, and extroversion and openness significantly predicted maximum performance. This research appears to indicate that personality is predictive of both types of performance. A separate study, however, found slightly different results, concluding that overall personality is more predictive of typical performance, while intelligence is still the best predictor of maximum performance. =Honesty= Many organizations give tests to potential employees during the interview process to determine their job knowledge, overall intelligence, or honesty, and use these to predict how the employee will perform if hired. Research has touched on how maximum performance can be predicted by these tests. For example, one tool is the integrity test, which is a test that attempts to assess whether potential employees will engage in deviant behavior on the job. Examples of such behavior can range from gossiping about a co-worker to stealing money from the organization. Researchers have linked integrity testing to maximum performance because they hypothesize that integrity levels will determine differences in how individuals perform their job, differences which can affect maximum performance in particular. Results obtained by Ones & Viswesvaran supported the use of integrity testing in predicting maximum performance, but also mentioned that job knowledge tests predicted maximum performance as well. Integrity tests are related to the personality factor of conscientiousness, which, as mentioned previously, has not been shown to be related to maximum performance. =Race= Research has also investigated racial differences in typical and maximum performance. Traditionally, studies have found that minority groups, specifically African Americans, score lower than Whites on intelligence tests, but that personality tests are less biased when predicting performance. As mentioned previously, typical performance has been linked to personality, and maximum performance has been linked to intelligence. Therefore, researchers expected African Americans to exhibit lower levels of maximum performance than Whites, with both ethnic groups showing similar levels of typical performance. However, a study by DuBois and colleagues found just the opposite. Whites outperformed African Americans when they observed typical performance; whereas, the difference was much less pronounced when they examined maximum performance. While this should not impact selection of employees, managers should be aware of the trend when observing performance. Purpose of distinction Distinguishing between typical and maximum performance can have both theoretical implications for researchers and practical purposes for organizations. =Academic implications= Conceptually, the different types of performance could have different predictors, which will affect research in this domain. For example, many studies have found differences in performance ratings depending on whether the rater is a supervisor or a peer. The typical/maximum distinction could explain this difference if, for instance, supervisors observe more maximum performance while peers observe more typical performance. =Practical implications= On the practical side, the typical/maximum distinction can be important when organizations hire new employees. For instance, even though many companies intend to evaluate what an individual's typical performance would be when making a hiring decision, often organizations use measures that should be associated with maximum performance. These common evaluations include assessment centers, intelligence tests, and situational interviews. Very little research has attempted to look at how various selection tools can predict an employee's behavior with regard to typical and maximum performance; however, one recent study did focus on behavior description interviews and situational interviews. Behavior description interviews ask applicants to describe past behavior related to specific aspects of the job, while situational interviews have applicants respond to hypothetical job-related dilemmas. Klehe and Latham found that both the behavior description interview and the situational interview predicted typical performance, and the situational interview also predicted maximum performance. While many researchers have expressed concerns about using these tools to predict typical performance, this study suggests that they may actually be quite useful. Another practical implication of this distinction is the effect it has on employee compensation. Managers may value typical and maximum performance differently, resulting in different rewards. Research suggests that both typical and maximum predict compensation levels, but organizations should ensure that this is the practice they wish to employ. Unanswered questions While there have been advances in typical vs. maximum performance theory since Sackett and colleagues' seminal paper, studies on this topic have been limited and many questions are still unanswered. In focusing on the antecedents of both performance types, conflicting research has prohibited researchers from drawing concrete conclusions as to how to forecast employees' potential performances. Specifically, there has not been consistent support for either personality as an antecedent of typical performance or intelligence as an antecedent of maximum performance. In addition, very few other antecedents have been suggested as relating to either type of performance. Another unanswered question is the time period that may elapse when studying maximum and typical performance. As mentioned, a requirement of maximum performance is that it must be observed over a \\"short period of time,\\" whereas typical performance is observed over an extended period of time. However, Sackett and other researchers have left the exact duration requirements vague. Future research could examine where the cutoff point between typical and maximum performance lies. Summary The distinction between typical and maximum performance has been evident for the past 20 years. Research shows that employees perform at a higher level when they are being temporarily observed compared to other times. The level of typical performance one will usually exhibit, and the level of maximum performance one can achieve, both seem to have particular antecedents. These may include intelligence, personality, honesty, and race. However, further research is needed to confirm and expand upon these findings.

Led by founder Baby- Face Willie, gang members operated the Grand Duke's Theatre and established the venue as their headquarters. Members of the Baxter Street Dudes wrote and performed plays, musicals and variety shows which were enjoyed by other street toughs and slummers throughout the city.Donovan, Frank D.

(pg. 101) The theater house eventually became a popular underworld hangout, from which the gang found financial success.  History  Five Points by George Catlin, 1827 During the time when Grand Duke's Theatre was at its peak, many movements occurring across the United States influenced the organization's ability to function. Abraham Lincoln was in office, the population was divided between North and South, and the volume of immigrants settling in the Northeastern region of the United States was massive. Immigration from Europe, increased the population significantly, changing the culture of the city making it more diverse. New York and neighboring states were rapidly developing throughout national conflict, with notable achievements including the introduction of the elevator and the creation of the first telephone line.  Street Children in New York  In the 1870s, America experienced a depression that forced many people, including children, to live on the streets. About 5,000 to 10,000 boys were estimated to be living on the streets of New York by the 1850s. The Children‚Äôs Aid Society reported around 15,000 homeless youths in 1870. Children were uneducated and treated poorly, enabling theft, mainly in the form of pick-pocketing. The number of pickpocket trials in the New York court rose from 52 in 1859 to 242 in 1876. Most children involved with these cases were between the ages of 15 to 24. Young Newsboy distributes newspapers on the street in the late 1800s Many children began their own newspaper-selling enterprises, commonly known as newsboys. Children around the age of ten purchased newspapers from local publishers and sold them to passers-by on the street. Newsboys often organized together to protect themselves and their earnings. Older adolescent males hired and managed younger boys and formed their own community of street children. A group of teenagers on Baxter street, consisting of mainly newsboys, formed The Baxter Street Dudes with fellow neighborhood members, experiencing a similar struggle during a dark economic period.  Baxter Street  In the 1800s, the Baxter Street Dudes operated and expanded into two districts within the Five Points, including Baxter Street and Mosco Street. A well-known detention complex, The Tombs, was situated in the Five Points neighborhood, and held many high profile criminals. Despite the active gangs in the late 1870s that enabled Baxter Street to earn a dangerous reputation, The Baxter Street Dudes were a nonviolent group of individuals. The Baxter Street Dudes experienced minor quarrels at the Grand Duke's Theatre between rival street organizations known for mugging, murdering, and tormenting citizens and other street thugs. Throughout performances by the Baxter Street Dudes at Grand Duke's Theatre, members of fellow gangs were known to disrupt actors by causing physical altercations, which eventually led to the foreclosure of the theater by NYPD. In addition to audience members impacting theater functionality, the Baxter Street Dudes refused to pay amusement taxes to the city.Harlow, Alvin F. Old Bowery Days: The Chronicles of a Famous Street. New York and London: D. Appleton & Company, 1931. (pg. 482)Knowles, Mark. Tap Roots: The Early History of Tap Dancing. McFarland, 2002. (pg. 176) The gang has been portrayed in a number of historical novels including Dreamland (2003) by Kevin Baker, The Five Points Concluded (2003) by Rocco Dormarunno, Sweet America: An Immigrants Story (2004) by Steven Knoll and Heyday: A Novel (2007) by Kurt Andersen.  The Grand Duke's Theatre  The Baxter Street Dudes started the Grand Duke's Theatre in 1872 under a bar at 21 Baxter Street in Manhattan. They performed to audiences of up to 300 people, selling tickets at 5¬¢ a person to 25¬¢ for private booths. These prices eventually rose to 20¬¢ a seat and $5 a booth because of their increased popularity. Demand for theater grew in New York City and the Baxter Street Dudes began making a $70 a week which was usually donated to charity. When the Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia visited New York, the boys named their establishment the Grand Duke‚Äôs Theatre after him. Members of the gang would steal their props and costumes, spending very little on their production. Despite the poor quality of their stage equipment, they consistently had popular performances for several years. Their fame as a performing group led them to travel outside of New York and performed in other cities at theaters, churches, and schools. New York began charging $500 for theater licensing in 1872, claiming slum theaters were negatively influencing the younger generations. The theater was challenged in court for not paying the fee in 1874 but its owners were able to win and stay in business.  Evolution of New York Street Gangs  * 1780s: As the American Revolution concluded, non-violent street gangs became prominent in the New York. * 1820s: Violent street gangs emerged in New York, influenced by immigration from Northern Europe, Western Europe, Poland, Italy, and Ireland. * 1880s: Tremendous immigration patterns of the Jewish and Italian population enabled a high density of individuals to dwell in slums of New York. With great shortages of housing opportunities, crime elevated throughout New York, and the correlation between slum dwellers and crime activity was noticed. Common crimes included drug distribution, political corruption, and theft. * 1910s: Mafia members stabilized in New York after moving from New Orleans. Such strength throughout the Mafia forced smaller, younger street groups to be overpowered and exposed as amateur criminals. * 1950s: The diminishing numbers of youth street gangs in New York enabled other demographics to compete for local power. Although many street gangs were diminished by the Mafia, white male-dominated groups began to form as new pressure emerged. African Americans from the South seeking employment opportunities threatened white male street gangs, which enabled the establishment of even more groups who were dedicated to fight racial integration. * 1960s: Brooklyn, New York was forced to develop low-income infrastructure due to high immigration patterns. With large groups of Latin Americans and Puerto Ricans populating the area, Brooklyn encountered extreme gang violence as more organizations formed based around social class and race. Throughout this decade of immense immigration of Latinos and African Americans, the two populations made up two thirds of the gang population in New York. * 1990s: After years of African American and Latino domination of New York, Hispanics emerged as the largest minority population in the state. This post World War II decade experienced incredible efforts to fight gang violence in New York; city officials strived for urban renewal by eliminating slums and the establishment of low-income housing.

It is characterized by its gray color, rough texture, and numerous fossils. Its type locality is Platteville, Wisconsin. It was heavily used in the early decades of the building of Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul and Faribault, Minnesota. Formation Like almost all limestones, the Platteville variety is a marine creation. Platteville Limestone formed between 488 and 436 million years ago, when what became southeastern Minnesota and southwestern Wisconsin lay beneath an ancient sea. This sea was heavily populated by shellfish and other invertebrates. As they died, their shells and other hard parts, made of calcium carbonate, fell to the ocean floor. Over the centuries, the weight of these deposits crushed the shell fragments and compressed them into stone. It overlies the thin Glenwood Shale, which overlies the thick St. Peter Sandstone. It is shot through with dolomitic mottles in an anastomose pattern; this dolotimization occurred after deposition but prior to the development of joints in the rock. About 100 million years later, geologic forces raised southeastern Minnesota above the ocean surface. In the area that became Twin Cities metropolitan region, the limestone was covered by thin deposits of shale and soil. Glaciers covered this region from 75,000 to about 12,000 years ago. When they finally melted, between 14,000 and 12,000 years ago, the released water carved the channels of the Mississippi, Minnesota, and smaller rivers through the layers of limestone, exposing some of it. This difficult- to-erode unit forms the cap of Saint Anthony Falls, Minnehaha Falls, and the Mississippi River bluffs in most of the Twin Cities area. Sea life was abundant during the Ordovician Period and a large number of marine fossils including corals, bryozoans, brachiopods, clams, snails, cephalopods, and trilobites can be found in the limestone sediments at several areas along the Mississippi River in the Twin Cities. Use When the United States Army began work on Fort Snelling in 1820, Platteville Limestone was abundant and nearby. The fort site lay atop a great deposit of the material. It is an easy stone to quarry, as it breaks readily. Soldiers built almost the entire original fort, from foundations to the round tower, out of Platteville stone. It remains the largest complex of Platteville structures ever made. Like Fort Snelling, downtown Saint Paul was built atop a Platteville shelf. Once the city moved beyond its early stage of flimsy and flammable wooden buildings, the local limestone came into heavy use. The first quarry went into operation in 1856. The Original Coney Island (1858), the Alexander Ramsey House (1868), and Church of the Assumption (1874) were all built partly or entirely from the local stone. Several fine examples of Platteville limestone's use in private houses can be found in Saint Paul's Summit Hill district, including the Burbank‚ÄìLivingston‚ÄìGriggs House (1862). The Platteville stone was quarried and used also in Minneapolis, though less of it survived there into the 21st century. Quarrying began in 1864 and builders used it for the original Customs House and City Hall (both 1873) and the original Central High School (1878). The most conspicuous survivor is the ruin of the Pillsbury A-Mill, built in 1881; its walls all Platteville stone quarried on site. Outside of the Twin Cities, Carleton College's first permanent building, Willis Hall (1872), was built of Platteville stone quarried at Dundas, Minnesota. In Faribault, the Cathedral of Our Merciful Saviour and Bethlehem Academy and the most of the main buildings of Shattuck-Saint Mary's were also made of Platteville. (The stone in this area tends to be a paler gray, often stained with light brown patches.) As a building stone, Platteville's chief attraction was its availability; in Saint Paul and Minneapolis it was often simply quarried on site. But it had limits. Coarse and crumbly, it could not be carved or polished to a smooth finish, and its gray color had limited appeal. With the spread of railroads in the 1870s, other, finer materials became available and affordable, including the red Lake Superior Sandstone and the buff-colored Kasota limestone that were more attractive and easier to work with. Builders rarely used Platteville for major projects after the 1880s. Minnehaha Park, Minneapolis. The Platteville Limestone is the less-eroded, layered unit that constitutes the majority of the photo. Below it is a thin, dark layer of Glenwood Shale. Below the shale is a thin, white stripe of St. Peter Sandstone, followed by a slope of eroded St. Peter Sandstone material.

It is the story of a young Nigerian who falls afoul of the British colonial authorites. Although the novel has a comic tone, the story itself is tragic. Joyce Cary has been quoted as saying that Mister Johnson was his favorite book that he had written. Mister Johnson is often read in schools and has had a wide audience. It has been adapted as a play by Norman Rosten and a 1990 film by Bruce Beresford. Chinua Achebe has said that Mister Johnson struck him as superficial and helped form his determination to write his own novels about Nigeria. Other critics have found Cary's portrayal of his main character patronizing and Johnson himself childish.  Plot summary  Johnson, a young African, is assigned as clerk at a British district office in Fada, Nigeria. He is from a different district and is regarded as a foreigner by those native to the area. Johnson works his way into local society, marrying there only one wife- he was monogamous-, but never really fitting in. At the same time, he has difficulties in adjusting to the regulations and mechanism of the district office and his official duties. The district officer, Rudbeck, meanwhile, is dissatisfied with his work in the service and his life in Africa. Rudbeck conceives the notion that a road linking Fada to the main highway and larger population centers will be of great benefit to the region. Johnson, as Rudbeck's clerk, also becomes enthused about this project. Johnson is one of Cary's joy-filled characters, possessor of a great energy that infects all around him. People are drawn to Johnson and follow him without realizing that they are being led. Indeed, Johnson has no clear idea of where he is going. His delight is in seeing those around him happy. His mood infects Rudbeck and, when Johnson suggests how the books may be fiddled to support Rudbeck's road project, the colonial officer is seduced. But Rudbeck's swindle is uncovered and he returns to England to be with his wife. Johnson now goes to work for Gollup, a retired army sergeant who has married a Nigerian woman and runs the local store. Gollup is an abusive drunker given to racist epithets, but he admires Johnson's good-humored courage in facing up to his words and blows. Johnson, in turn, enjoys the compliment to his courage and, when Gollup next attacks him, retaliates. Gollup does not take this kind of violence seriously and thinks no less of Johnson, but he cannot have an employee who has struck him in public. Johnson is let go and leaves Fada. Meanwhile, a shortage of political officers means that Rudbeck must return. He immediately recommences his road-building. Rudbeck and his superior work out the extent to which he can finagle road-building funds from the accounts, but the older man warns Rudbeck that another scandal will destroy his career. The road-building brings Johnson back to Fada. Rudbeck hires him again and Johnson's infectious enthusiasm makes the road-building successful. But Rudbeck discovers that Johnson has been engaged in petty graft and dismisses him. Johnson turns to theft from the store to support his lifestyle and, when Gollup discovers him, kills the storekeeper. Now Rudbeck must try Johnson for murder. The trial brings Rudbeck to the breaking point. Johnson is found guilty and begs Rudbeck to keep him from the gallows by killing him. Rudbeck follows his heart rather than the rules and does so, though the act will destroy his career and possibly have other ramifications, legal and personal, that lie beyond the close of the novel.

It is alleged that the coal industry's trade union leadership forms the upper echelon of this arrangement and employs caste allegiances to maintain its power.S. Venugopala Rao, Crime in Our Society: A Political Perspective, Vikas Publishing House, 1983, : \\"Using the vast money, muscle and caste power, trade union leaders have built up a Mafia-like empire which totally controls the life and economy of Dhanbad ... workers who constitute about 40 percent of Dhanbad districts population are mainly tribals, adivasis, Harijans and backward castes, while the trade union musclemen are mostly Rajputs of Bhojpur and Rohtas districts.\\" Pilferage and sale of coal on the black market, inflated or fictitious supply expenses, falsified worker contracts and the expropriation and leasing-out of government land have allegedly become routine.Ajeet N. Mathur, Asian Regional Team for Employment Promotion, World Employment Programme, Industrial Restructuring and Union Power: Micro-economic Dimensions of Economic Restructuring and Industrial Relations in India, International Labour Organization, 1991, : \\"According to many workers, it is not possible for genuine trade unionism to flourish in Dhanbad because of illicit trading and profiteering in the garb of trade unionism and the protective umbrella such an institution holds out.\\" A parallel economy has developed with a significant fraction of the local population employed by the mafia in manually transporting the stolen coal for long distances over unpaved roads to illegal mafia warehouses and points of sale. The coal mafia has had a negative effect on Indian industry, with coal supplies and quality varying erratically. Higher quality coal is sometimes selectively diverted, and missing coal is replaced with stones and boulders in railway cargo wagons. A human corpse has been discovered in a sealed coal wagon.D. K. Mittal, Coal Industry, Anmol Publications Private Limited, 1994, . Snippet: \\"Default on quality, quantity and timely supply of coal have taken their toll on the Indian industry and come in their way in acquiring international competitiveness ... coal ministry officials have themselves observed boulders and dust being loaded in wagons supposed to be carrying steam coal ... checking officials even found the dead body of a person.\\" In June 2012, the Bollywood epic Gangs of Wasseypur was released portraying the coal mafia in the area of Dhanbad. The movie received overwhelming response and was declared a hit. Another Bollywood movie Gunday was also loosely based upon coal mafia. Timber mafias Protected forest areas in parts of India ‚Äì such as Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Jharkhand ‚Äì are vulnerable to illegal logging by timber mafias that have coopted or intimidated forestry officials, local politicians, businesses and citizenry.Marcus Colchester and Christian Erni, Indigenous Peoples and Protected Areas in South and Southeast Asia: From Principles to Practice, IWGIA, 1999, : \\"The Forest Department is perceived as corrupt, colluding with timber contractors (the timber mafia), and taking bribes from the communities in return.\\"Ajay Singh Rawat, Forest Management in Kumaon Himalaya: Struggle of the Marginalised People, Indus Publishing, 1999, : \\"within 5 years in the Western Circle, 13 forest officials have been murdered and 39 fatally wounded in their bid to prevent illicit timber trade ... Politicians are chary of getting on the wrong side of the timber mafia, which has proved to be extremely generous during election time.\\" Contractor mafias Public works, such as road construction, are sometimes dominated by contractor mafias. Many state-funded construction activities in India, such as road building, are dominated by construction mafias, which are groupings of corrupt public works officials, materials suppliers, politicians and construction contractors. \\"The road sector has always been the main source of income for the mafia. They either ask their men directly to grab the contracts or allow an outsider to take the contract after accepting a hefty commission ... a large number of criminals have been grabbing contracts under the protective umbrella of parties like SP, BSP, BJP, as well as the Congress ... opportunity to refurbish the image of his Government by initiating a crackdown on the mafia- contractor-engineer nexus.\\" Shoddy construction and material substitution (e.g., mixing sand in cement while submitting expenses for cement) result in roads and highways being dangerous and sometimes simply washed away when India's heavy monsoon season arrives. \\"this year's rains have destroyed 581 roads in the state with 139 road accidents killing 373 people through 10 August ... they spoke about a road building contractor mafia that pretty much has a lock on many projects for redoing roads‚Äîapparently year after year.\\" In a widely covered case, Satyendra Dubey, a project director with the National Highways Authority of India, was murdered in 2003, allegedly because he had written a letter exposing deep-seated contractor mafia involvement in the construction of a section of the prestigious Golden Quadrilateral project to the prime minister's office. \\"Dubey ... was shot dead near the Circuit House in Gaya after he exposed deep-rooted corruption in construction of the Golden Quadrilateral Project. ... It was proved beyond any doubt that Dubey was killed soon after he wrote a letter to the Prime Minister's Office and blew the whistle on the contract mafia. Though he requested that his name not be made public, vested interests leaked his name.\\" Although a CBI investigative report after the assassination stated that there was no contractor mafia involvement in Dubey's murder, \\" The CBI has reiterated before the Supreme Court that there is no of any contractor mafia in the murder of NHAI engineer Satyendra Kumar Dubey.\\" his family and supporters maintained that an attempt at a cover-up was being made. \\"We strongly feel that the CBI was trying its best to save the main culprits or mafia behind his murder and making it a case of simple robbery.\\" ... \\"We have full evidence to show that the arrested accused in the case by CBI were not the real face behind his murder, Dhananjay said, claiming that the arrested accused were forced by the CBI to accept the crime they never committed.\\" Attempts have been made to reduce mafia influence by making construction tendering processes more transparent, sometimes by attempting to move them online, so that a complete audit trail of bids and activity is maintained. Construction mafias are alleged to have used their political influence decisively to frustrate many such attempts, for example, in the public works for which the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is responsible. \\"For the past two years, Mr. Mehta has been trying to introduce on-line tendering system and mandatory quality test by an independent testing agency. \\"However, because of the strong nexus between engineers, politicians and contractors, it is the tender mafia which now decides which contractors should get a particular contract,\\" officials said. ... so strong was the dominance of tender mafia that new contractors were not being allowed to enter the civic body.\\" Land mafias A local land mafia reportedly attempted to seize land planned to be used by the Central Zoo Authority as the site for India's first night safari. In cities and villages throughout India, mafias consisting of municipal and other government officials, elected politicians, judicial and law enforcement officials, acquire, develop and sell land in illegal ways for profit.K.R. Gupta and J.R. Gupta, \\"Indian Economy, Vol# 2\\", Atlantic Publishers & Distributors, 2008, . \\"the land market already stands subverted and an active land mafia has already been created.\\" Sometimes, government land or land ostensibly acquired for some legitimate government purpose is then handed over to real estate developers who build commercial and residential properties and sell them in the open market, often with the connivance of administrative and police officials. \\"Low priced subsidised land is being illegally developed ... permits are obtained illegally through a network of mafia style operators that involved the under world, former Indian Administrative Service officers and even the cops ... alleged misappropriation of land in the name of CGHS and selling them at very high rates after construction of flats.\\" In one set of allegations in Karnataka, a lake was filled in and government buildings torn down after illegal transfers to a developer by mafia-connected officials. \\"The watershed department had built a check dam at a cost of Rs150,000 in 2006 to improve the groundwater level. But the land mafia has taken things into its own hands and got it covered.\\" Eminent domain laws, intended to procure private land at relatively low prices for public benefit or redistribution to poorer people under social justice programs, are abused to pressure landholders to sell land to a government entity, which transfers the land to developers at those low prices, and who in turn sell it back on the market at much higher prices.N. Vittal, India: Technology and a vision for the future, The Icfai University Press, 2004, : \\"Another law which had a totally contradictory impact was the Urban Land Ceiling Act which provided tremendous opportunity for the land mafia. The poor people who were supposed to benefit in the process were nowhere to be seen.\\"Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narayana Madhava Ghatate, Decisive Days, Shipra Publications, 1999: \\"In villages on the outskirts of the cities, land is being grabbed by force by the lathi-wielding miscreants. This land is public land. Skyscrapers are being built.\\" Computerisation of records relating to the classification of tracts and land ownership is a key tool in countering the illegal activities of land mafias, since it creates transparency on all information relating to a given parcel of land. This approach has been effective in Bangalore,N. Vittal, Roots of Effective Governance, Icfai University Press, 2007, : \\"transparency ... was introduced in allotment of sites. The element of discretion involved in this process was removed. The whole system was totally computerised. The allotment details were published on the website and the lease cum-sale agreement was done away with. Absolute sale deeds were issued.\\" but efforts to extend it elsewhere have sometimes met with strong resistance by land mafias, manifesting itself as bureaucratic inaction. \\"For this purpose the Centre formulated a scheme for the computerisation of land records. It pledged to meet the entire expense of the task. About Rs50 million have been given to the State (Bihar) for this purpose; it has been able to utilise only Rs2.2 million! The target is that by December next year there shall be one hundred per cent coverage of \\"Jot Bahi/Khatta\\": actual coverage till now? Ten per cent.\\" Focused vigilance in specific areas by government agencies has acted as a deterrent to land mafia activities. For example, the land mafia in the Noida area, on the outskirts of Delhi, was reported to have illegally begun carving out plots for commercial sale on land identified by the Central Zoo Authority of India as the site for India's first Night Safari park. \\"Land mafia is busy carving out plots in the prestigious Night Safari project and selling them at Rs800 per sq mt to gullible buyers. Surprisingly, the Greater Noida Authority is oblivious of this development.\\" Subsequent to coverage in the press, vigorous legal action by the Greater Noida Authority reportedly led to this mafia alliance backing away from this theft, although it may have shifted its attention to illegally encroaching on land along the Taj Expressway, connecting Delhi and Agra, which is expected to become quite valuable. The biggest Mafia is the Congress Party of the Italian and the media specially English and electronic which is in hands of Drug, Organ, Child Traffickers, and prostitution mafia and Xian terrorists\\"When further action was taken on projects like Javer Airport, Night Safari, Formula 1 racing track, etc, the land mafia and realtor shifted their focus on Greater Noida and Taj Expressway land ... The land along a distance of 160 km from Greater Noida to Agra is not being fully guarded from land sharks, it is learnt.\\" See also * Vohra Report * Licence Raj * Corruption in India * Police corruption References Category:Politics of India Category:Corruption in India Category:Corruption in Pakistan Category:Organised crime in India Category:Organised crime in Pakistan Category:Indian slang Category:Indian English idioms Category:Political terminology in Pakistan Category:Pakistani English idioms Category:Forestry in India ","title":"Mafia Raj"},{"id":"19995077","text":"Life Show () is a 2002 Chinese film directed by Huo Jianqi.

History Geneva Senior High School Campus from 1926-1981 Geneva Junior High/Middle School Campus from 1981-2004 Relatively little is known about the early history of Geneva public schools. On June 19, 1812, the New York State legislature passed an act for the establishment of Common Schools which became the basis of the common school system in the State of New York. The date of the first public school established in Geneva in compliance with this act was in 1815.Emmons, Thayles. The Story of Geneva. New York: The Finger Lakes Times, 1982. Subsequently, a number of schools were established in Geneva. In 1853, the Geneva Union School was incorporated and authorized to maintain a classical department and to instruct a normal class. In 1863, Geneva schools were desegregated. On March 16, 1869, the Union School‚Äôs corporate title was changed to ‚ÄúThe Geneva Classical and Union School.‚Äù It was the first Union School built in New York State. In 1924-1925, a commodious High School building was built at the corner of Milton and Pulteney Streets in the City of Geneva. The school was erected on the grounds formerly occupied by a cemetery; the bodies from which were exhumed and removed to Glenwood Cemetery. The building was used by Finger Lakes Community College for several years starting in 2007, before being demolished in 2014. In 1981, the high school was moved to its present location at 101 Carter Road in the City of Geneva. Administration The District offices are located at 400 West North Street in Geneva.

However, true wheels and propellers‚Äîdespite their utility in human vehicles‚Äîdo not appear to play a significant role in the movement of living things (with the exception of certain flagella, which function like corkscrews). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction. Given the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as wings and lenses), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation‚Äîand the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several developmental and evolutionary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by natural selection, addressing the question \\"Why can't life evolve wheels?\\" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as walking, running, or slithering) in natural environments, addressing the question \\"If wheels could evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?\\" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport. Known instances of rotation in biology There exist two distinct modes of locomotion using rotation: first, simple rolling; and second, the use of wheels or propellers, which spin on an axle or shaft, relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, single-celled organisms. =Rolling= The pangolin Manis temminckii in a defensive posture, in which it can roll Some organisms use rolling as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently. Several species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force. Tumbleweeds, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to distribute their seeds. These plants are found especially in open plain environments. The most well-known of these include Kali tragus (also known as Salsola tragus), or prickly Russian thistle, which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a noxious weed. Fungi of the genus Bovista are known to use the same strategy to disperse their spores. Rotifers are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments. Although the Latin name rotifer means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating cilia used for feeding and propulsion. Keratinocytes, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of wound healing. These cells serve to form a barrier against pathogens and moisture loss through wounded tissue. Dung beetles form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with. =Free rotation= Macroscopic Among animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently. Microscopic There are two known examples of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells. ATP synthase is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer. It bears some similarity to the flagellar motors discussed below. ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by modular evolution, in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality. alt=Physical model of the base of a bacterial flagellum The only known example of a biological \\"wheel\\"‚Äîa system capable of providing continuous propulsive torque about a fixed body‚Äîis the flagellum, a corkscrew-like tail used by single-celled prokaryotes for propulsion. The bacterial flagellum is the best known example. About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum, indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems, though its use is restricted to the microscopic environment. At the base of the bacterial flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60 cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water. Archaea, a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella ‚Äì known as archaella ‚Äì driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and evolutionarily distinct from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial Type III secretion system, archaella appear to have evolved from type IV pili. Some eukaryotic cells, such as the protist Euglena and animal sperm, possess a convergent, evolutionary distinct flagellum-like structure known as a cilium or undulipodium. Unlike bacterial flagella, these structures do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip whips in a circle. However, some protists may still have been observed utilizing free rotation. Navicula, a type of diatom, may possess an unconventional rolling mechanism unrelated to the flagellum.

Biological barriers to wheeled organisms The absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: natural selection constrains the evolutionary paths available to species, and the processes by which multicellular organisms grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel. =Evolutionary constraints= Illustration of a fitness landscape, indicating genetic flow of populations toward local optima. Potentially beneficial changes requiring descent into a fitness \\"valley\\" are foreclosed by natural selection. The processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism. Adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the fitness of individuals. Although neutral changes (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through genetic drift, and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances, large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. Richard Dawkins describes the matter: \\"The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of Mount Improbable.\\" In such a fitness landscape, wheels might sit on a highly favorable \\"peak\\", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the gene pool to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. Stephen Jay Gould notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that \\"wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy\\". Natural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the evolution of flagella, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called exaptation. Molecular biologist Robin Holliday has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against creationist or intelligent design accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator‚Äîfree of the limitations imposed by evolution‚Äîwould be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use. =Developmental and anatomical constraints= Using human manufacturing processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of embryonic development are suited to‚Äîor even capable of‚Äîproducing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below. The greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the interface between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly axle) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism. Unlike animal joints, which have a limited range of motion, a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be \\"unwound\\". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism). There are several functional problems created by this requirement, though these may be partly surmountable. Power transmission to driven wheels thumb In the case of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in the case of a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size. Friction Reducing friction is vital for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely. Nutrient and waste transfer Another potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of blood vessels, oxygen, nutrients, and waste products would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin (of which hair and nails are composed). Disadvantages of wheels Wheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with limbed locomotion. These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the \\"missed opportunity\\" of biology that it first seems. In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not \\"Why does nature not produce wheels?\\", but rather, \\"Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?\\" The use of wheels rather than limbs in most engineered vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of design required to construct and control limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs. =Efficiency= Rolling resistance reaction force N, with a component opposing the motion. (W is the weight of the wheel plus the supported portion of the vehicle; F is a propulsive force; r is the wheel radius.) Although stiff wheels are more energy efficient than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact. Rolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During the time of the Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by oxen. Efficiency of aquatic locomotion When moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low Reynolds numbers (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas oscillating systems have the advantage at higher (inertia-dominated) Reynolds numbers. Whereas ship propellers typically have efficiencies around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered Gossamer Condor), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%‚Äì98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible foil like a fish tail or bird wing. =Traction= Wheels are prone to slipping‚Äîan inability to generate traction‚Äîon loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground‚Äîbut they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex. =Obstacle navigation= Work by engineer Mieczys≈Çaw G. Bekker implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log- normal; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains at all size scales. The primary means of obstacle navigation on land are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges. Going around Anatomist Michael LaBarbera of the University of Chicago illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and wheelchair-using humans. As Jared Diamond points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by dung beetles and tumbleweeds. Going over Wheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height. Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter. In addition, without articulation, a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground. Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain. With unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable ‚Äì that is, it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Suspension systems often mitigate the tendency of wheeled vehicles to overturn, but unlike fully articulated limbs, they do not provide any ability to recover from an overturned position. =Versatility= Limbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as grasping, manipulating, climbing, branch-swinging, swimming, digging, jumping, throwing, kicking, and grooming. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles. In fiction and legend Buer, from the 1863 edition of Dictionnaire Infernal Legends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe, Japan, pre-Columbian Mexico, the United States, and Australia. =Rolling creatures= The hoop snake, a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey. Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the Tsuchinoko. Buer, a demon mentioned in the 16th-century grimoire Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, was described and illustrated in Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled. The Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher illustrated a rolling creature of his own invention in a 1951 lithograph. Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author Carl Barks, science fiction writers Fredric Brown, George R. R. Martin, and Joan Slonczewski, and in the Sonic the Hedgehog video game series, which first appeared in 1991. =Wheeled creatures= Toy animals with wheels dating from the Pre-Columbian era were uncovered by archaeologists in Veracruz, Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans. Several twentieth-century writers explored possibilities of wheeled creatures. L. Frank Baum's 1907 children's novel Ozma of Oz features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers. Their wheels are composed of keratin, which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs. In the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including Clifford D. Simak, Piers Anthony, David Brin, K. A. Applegate, Philip Pullman, and writing partners Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. Some of these works address the developmental and biomechanical constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from arthritic axles, and Pullman's Mulefa are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they coevolved.

Background Fred Robbins was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His birth name was Fred Rubin. He attended Baltimore City College and the University of Baltimore Law School, graduating in 1938. While at the University of Baltimore, Robbins was the features and radio editor of The Baloo (the official campus news weekly), and he was also a member of the tennis team and dramaticclub. Career He began a career in broadcasting, at a Baltimore station. Robbins later became the disc jockey of the Robbins Nest radio show on WINS, WABC and WNEW in New York, and the host of television variety and quiz shows there. He was briefly the host of The Talent Shop and Cavalcade of Bands for the DuMont TV network. From 1953 through 1956, he was the announcer/host, and Coca-Cola's spokesman, on Coke Time with Eddie Fisher on NBC. Robbins did interview programs for many radio networks and filmed nearly 100 behind-the-scenes features on movie making (through his \\"Robbins Nest\\" production unit), which were broadcast for nearly a decade on CBS Movie Nights. Robbins starred or played himself in more than two dozen television shows or movies from the 1940s through the 1980s. He was also a feature interviewer for CNN's Showbiz Tonight and wrote profiles of celebrities for many magazines. In 1948, The New York Times' writer Carter Harman credited Robbins for \\"doing much for bop\\". Robbins also co-produced and presented (with Ernie Anderson) live concerts, one of which was Billie Holiday's comeback concert at Carnegie Hall at midnight on March 27, 1948, right after she was released from a prison stay at Alderson prison for women in West Virginia. Robbins's career expanded, and he began interviewing celebrities. On October 29, 1966, he interviewed John Lennon on the set of the movie How I Won the War in Carboneras, Spain. Robbins also had an hour-long disc-jockey program that was syndicated via electrical transcription. In 1948 the trade publication Broadcasting noted that the show was carried by more than 100 stations. He was immortalized by two jazz compositions, one by Billy Strayhorn called \\"Snibor\\", his name spelled backwards. It was recorded by the Duke Ellington Orchestra in 1947 and subsequently in 1967. The other composition was \\"Robbins Nest\\" by Sir Charles Thompson and recorded by many artists'. It became a jazz standard. Robbins died of lymphoma on June 23, 1992, at the Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 73 years old. Notes References * University of Baltimore. \\"The Reporter Yearbook 1938\\".

Biography Gwizdala's beginnings in music started at age 11 with classical guitar lessons at the Merton Music Foundation from Peter Woodings, as well as study in classical music through brass ensembles and orchestral percussion, drum lessons with now Buzzcocks drummer Danny Farrant, and participation in almost every style and genre of ensemble that was offered by the MMF. Through these early years Gwizdala's main interest was in drums, and it was the lure of one of his favorite drummers, Ian Thomas, that convinced him to attend a local jazz gig at the Gun Tavern in Croydon with a friend, the band leader Laurence Cottle. The next day a bass was purchased and Gwizdala followed Cottle around London and the UK, learning everything he could. A job at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London as assistant sound engineer led to meeting Brazilian jazz musicians Airto Moreira and Flora Purim. After an invitation to sit in with them in London in 1998, it was on Flora's advice that Gwizdala move to the U.S. and attend Berklee College of Music. While studying at Berklee, Gwizdala joined the band of Kenwood Dennard and was afforded the opportunity to work with musicians like Pete Levin and Hiram Bullock. Before leaving Berklee and Boston, Gwizdala would meet several people that would become lifelong musical collaborators, including Bob Reynolds, Tim Miller, and Hal Crook. After three semesters at Berklee, Gwizdala moved to New York City to pursue his career. Working day and night on his playing, and managing to land several high- profile gigs, the next eight years would include tours, record dates, production, musical direction, and performances with Jive Jones, Adam Freeland, Mike Philips, Jem, Delta Goodrem, Wayman Tisdale, Wayne Krantz, Mike Stern, Randy Brecker, Paul Shafer, VV Brown, Pat Metheny, Ronny Jordan, Marcus Miller, Dapp Theory, James Valentine, Jojo Mayer, and Jeff Lorber.

Founded in the early 1920s St Johns River Base has 8 large campsites plus many pavilions and program areas to fit your Scouting Adventure. All Scouting Packs, Troops, Teams, Crews, and Posts are encouraged to come and hike the wilds of Echockotee, fish the shore of Doctor's Lake, and build memories for years to come.

Camp Shands, located on of diverse Florida terrain. There are 8 focused program areas for every Scout, regardless of their tenure. The Green Bar Bill program is for first year campers. Order of the Arrow Echockotee Lodge, a chartered Lodge of the National Order of the Arrow, was founded in 1941, with an initial Ordeal held at Camp Echockotee on May 9 of that year. The first Ordeal class of 36 candidates was made up of youth and adults selected by a council committee, for their prior service to Scouting and the Summer Camp program. The initial totem of the fledgling Lodge was the alligator, but in an organizational meetings that summer, the totem was changed to that of the left-handed handclasp, and the name of the camp was adopted as the Lodge name (\\"Echockotee\\" is a Seminole word meaning \\"we are brothers\\"). For many years the Lodge was active with Summer Camp activities, holding meetings at the end of camp or occasionally at the Seminole Hotel in Jacksonville during the year. Echockotee hosted the first statewide gathering of lodges, called Area Meetings in 1945, 1946 and 1947 (among the first such gatherings in the country). Not until the mid-1950s did regularly scheduled lodge weekends take place away from Summer Camp, as Echockotee does today. The Lodge undertook a major portion of the maintenance of Camp Echockotee at Fellowships and Service Days, and did the same when the North Florida Council developed Camp Shands as a new summer camp in 1967. Since then, the Lodge has held all of its fellowship weekends at Shands. Besides the work done to make Shands the facility it is today, the Lodge worked hard to dominate many of the inter- lodge competitions held at the Area Conferences, building healthy rivalries and traditions that continue to this day. The development of the Dance Team started in the late 1950s and many members have won awards in the Area (now Section) and National level in this field of competition. In the 1970s, Echockotee built on its legacy of service with additional fixtures at Camp Shands, building the obstacle course and council ring for Section Conferences hosted by the Lodge in 1978 and 1983. Other facilities at Shands that bear the Stamp of Echockotee involvement are the rifle range, ecology and handicraft buildings, the dining hall and the waterfront shelter. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the lodge received the National Service Award, which is presented to only 8 lodges in the Order each year for the outstanding quantity and quality of their contributions.http://www.echockotee.org/lodge.php?page=lodge&subpage;=history In addition several Echockotee members have been recognized by the National Order of the Arrow Committee for their outstanding service on a Section, Region or National level with the Distinguished Service Award .

He is considered one of the most illustrious and reviving spirits of the Greek letters of his time. Biography Born in Hermoupolis, the capital of the island of Syros, to a family of rich aristocrats from Chios -- who had fled the island after the massacre of its population by the Ottomans in 1822 -- he spent much of his youth abroad. Rhoides was erudite and at a young age had mastered not only the languages of continental Europe, but also ancient Greek and Latin. His early youth years he spent in Genoa, Italy in the times of the Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states and the revolt of Genoa. He studied history, literature and philosophy in Berlin, and later in Ia»ôi, Romania where his merchant father had transferred the centre of his business activities. Obeying a parental wish, he moved to Athens, where he printed the translation of Chateaubriand's Itin√©raires. In 1860, after a brief sojourn in Egypt, he decided to live and stay permanently in Athens. Later in his life, he would become very poor, especially with the bankruptcy of the family business, and the subsequent suicide of his beloved brother Nicholas. He eked out his last years by working as a curator for the National Library of Greece. But, even from this position he was dismissed in 1902, when he got into a political dispute with the government. Rhoides suffered all through his life from a serious hearing problem, which eventually impaired his sense to near deafness. In 1866 Rhoides published a controversial novel, The Papess Joanne ( ·º© Œ†Œ¨œÄŒπœÉœÉŒ± ·º∏œâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ±), an exploration of the legend of Pope Joan, a supposed female pope who reigned some time in the ninth or tenth century (which was in fact a time of great turmoil for the papacy). Though a romantic novel with satirical overtones, Rhoides asserted it contained conclusive evidence that Pope Joan truly existed and that the Catholic Church had been attempting to cover up the fact for centuries. The book's scathing attacks on what he viewed as an uneducated, uncultured, superstitious and backward clergy were controversial, and led to Rhoides's excommunication from the Greek Orthodox Church which perceived that its own clergy was the real target of those attacks. Rhoides often adopted a clear-cut critical stance against the romanticism in literature and poetry and often was poignant and sarcastic to the romance writers and poets of his time. Rhoides, amongst his numerous translations, became the first to translate the works of Edgar Allan Poe into Greek. He wrote frequently in many newspapers and magazines, and published his own satirical newspaper called Asmodaios.

During a prolonged absence of her husband on a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. James of Compostela (see Way of St. James), Jeanne, believing him dead, gathered under her roof a number of pious women, with whom she made a vow of perpetual chastity, and consecrated herself to a religious life devoted to the service of the poor. On his return in 1329, √âtienne obtained for his wife a dispensation from her vow on condition that the pious association be permitted to retain his house and be endowed with a capital sufficient for the maintenance of twelve poor women. He also erected a chapel for the community, which was soon in possession of its own hospital, and rapidly increased in numbers. The statutes of the Haudriettes, as prescribed for them by Cardinal d'Ailly, were approved in 1414 by Cardinal Nicol√≤ da Pisa, legate of Pope John XXII, and later confirmed by several pontiffs. A gradual relaxation in the original fervour of the congregation caused a thorough reform to be instituted under Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld, Grand Almoner of France. Pope Gregory XV placed the religious under the Rule of St. Augustine, the vow of poverty being added to those of chastity and obedience and monastic observance and the recitation of the Office of the Blessed Virgin imposed. In 1622 the motherhouse was transferred to Rue Saint- Honor√©, where a new monastery and church were built, the latter being dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, from which the religious were thenceforth called Daughters of the Assumption. The congregation was not restored after the Revolution. References ;Attribution * The entry cites: **Heimbucher, Orden und Kongregationen der kath.

Early life and career Neelo was born Cynthia Alexander Fernandes on 30 June 1940 in Bhera, Sargodha, Pakistan. At age 16, she appeared in Bhowani Junction (1956), a Hollywood film shot in and around Lahore. She got her big breakthrough in Pakistani films when she performed on the song \\"Aaye mausam, rangilay suhanay\\" in the film Saat Lakh (1957) with music by the renowned music director Rasheed Attre. Controversies In 1965, at the peak of her popularity, she was summoned by Malik Amir Mohammad Khan, then Governor of West Pakistan, to dance on stage for the Shah of Iran during his official visit to Pakistan; but she refused to do it for her own reasons. Harassed and threatened, Neelo faced dire consequences for refusing to obey official orders. She was allegedly gang molested and attempted suicide on the way to the Governor's house and was taken to a hospital instead, where the doctors saved her life. The renowned leftist poet Habib Jalib, on hearing of the incident, expressed his anguish in his poem over her attempted suicide: \\"Tu kay nawaqif-e-aadab-e-ghulami hae abhi..\\" Later this poem was used in the film Zarqa (1969) with slight changes in the words and ended up becoming a super-hit film song in Pakistan. The film song became much more relevant, effective and popular because it was picturised on Neelo herself and was based on similar real life events in Neelo's life. She also won the Best Actress Nigar Award for film Zarqa (1969). It had superb music by Wajahat Attre and sung by Mehdi Hassan. Film Zarqa (1969) was produced and directed by Riaz Shahid who also wrote its screenplay. Neelo helped her husband, Riaz Shahid, produce this film and it became the best known film of her career.Profile of actress Neelo on cineplot.com website Retrieved 18 July 2018 Personal life Neelo was born into a Catholic family.

WVaSS was founded by Roger Baroody who was motivated to continue the survey begun by William E. Davies (1917‚Äì1990) in his Caverns of West Virginia (1949, 1950, 1965). Davis‚Äô book and its updates were published as part of the West Virginia Geological Survey series, but after 1965 it became apparent that no further updates would be forthcoming. Large quantities of new cave and karst data were becoming available and so the need for a dedicated survey program seemed evident. Organization and history The WVaSS is a highly informal, voluntary, non- profit association of cavers and caving groups. In 1978, WVaSS became a Study Group of the National Speleological Society (NSS) and in 1987 was granted 501c3 tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. Safeguards For reasons of cave conservation and safety, it is the policy of WVaSS to sell bulletins only to NSS members and individuals and agencies doing karst research. Certain caves contain unique speleothems, rare forms of cave life, or have serious landowner-caver relations problems. For these caves, the WVaSS may refrain from publication. Publications Beginning in 1971, the WVaSS has produced 19 publications (‚Äúbulletins‚Äù) to date. It has attempted to maintain a balance between bulletins that simply present cave surveys/descriptions (14 so far) and bulletins advancing specific karst research (5 so far). In aggregate, the 11 survey bulletins have provided descriptions of over 2175 caves in 14 West Virginia counties. The research survey bulletins include a master's thesis on cave development, a bibliography of West Virginia caves and karst, and bulletins on the invertebrate and vertebrate fauna of West Virginia caves. =WVaSS publications= :An asterisk (*) indicates an out-of-print publication.

Its historical significance is threefold. It has been inhabited from ancient times; artifacts continue to be recovered from the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages and a well-known barrow (burial mound) Tumulus from the Bronze Age still exists there. It is connected to Clan Hay in that Eva of Pitmilly, the Celtic heiress to these lands,Although Eva is usually referred to as a Celtic heiress,her parentage and, therefore, her ethnicity, have not been established. married William II de Haya, a Norman, in the 12th century C.E., with the couple becoming the progenitors of that Scottish clan. Finally, for over seven centuries, it was owned by the important Monypenny family.Balfour 1909, p.275.Black 1946, p.609. Pitmilly Lands The name, Pitmilly or Pitmillie, has been used for centuries, but many variants occurred in earlier times. These include Petmullin, Pitmulin, Pethmolyn, and Pitmaulin. They probably reflect the P-Celtic, Scottish Gaelic, Scots and Latin languages, coupled with no great desire for consistency in spelling and the modification of place names that occurs so often. The prefix pit is derived from the P-Celtic word, pett,Roberts 1997, p.10. meaning a piece of land, and is very common in place-names in this part of Scotland. The second part of the name means mill, regardless of its various forms. Pitmilly means, therefore, a piece of land by the mill(s), and indeed, there are still ruined mills at Pitmilly. The Pitmilly Lands lie on both sides of the Pitmilly Burn, a stream that joins the larger Kenly Water, just before the latter reaches the North Sea between Craig Hartle and Babbet Ness on the east Fife coast. The lands on the east side of the Pitmilly Burn border that sea. In order to define further the Pitmilly Lands as they have been known through the centuries, it is helpful to note that in the early 20th century, before it was broken up, the Pitmilly estate consisted of the manor house with its grounds, known as Pitmilly House, several farms, a flax mill and a grist mill, both of which may have been ruins then, and a fisherman's bothy. The farms, all of which are identified on the 2008 Ordnance Survey map, are Boghall, Falside, Hillhead, Morton of Pitmilly and Kilduncan. A possible source of confusion is that the Kenly Water has sometimes been known, and shown on maps, as Pitmilly Burn, but it seems clear that the Pitmilly Burn of the Pitmilly Lands is a tributary stream. A study of the cartography of the region from 1642 onThe earliest map, a 1642 manuscript map by James Gordon, which was subsequently published in 1654 as an engraving by Joan Blaeu, identifies \\"Pitmilli\\" (\\"Pitmilly\\" on Blaue's map) and shows both Pitmilly Burn and Kenly Water, without naming them. Blaue's map appeared in his Atlas of Scotland, the first publication of its kind. Herman Moll, in his 1745 map, identifies \\"Pitmil\\" and shows both burns without naming them on the land. However, he notes \\"Pit Mille Burne\\" at the mouth of Kenly water. In 1775, Ainslie (Fife) identifies \\"Pitmilly Burnmouth\\" at the mouth of Kenly Water. He depicts that burn, but obviously considers it to be Pitmilly Burn; he does not show Pitmilly Burn, the smaller stream. He depicts the square area of Pitmilly House and grounds, labeling them as \\"Pitmilly Coll.\\" and \\"Moneypenny\\". The farms, Hillhead, Falside, which is shown near the mouth of the two burns, Moortown, Kilduncan, Donaldton and Boghall are marked. The same names are identified on another map by Ainslie (Fife and Kinross), but are harder to read. Greenwood et al.,in 1828, also show the extent of the Pitmilly House grounds, labeling them as \\"Pitmilly\\". They show the two burns, but label neither on land; at the coast they note \\"Kenlywater Mouth.\\" Moreover, Greenwood et al. label clearly the farms identified by Ainslie but Moortown has become Morton and Falside is spelled Fallside and is shown considerably further inland. A few years later, Thomson and Johnson, in 1832, show Kenly Water and Pitmilly Burn reaching the North Sea separately, but identify neither on land. However, at the coast they note \\"Pitmilly Burn Mouth\\" They also show the Pitmilly House grounds, labeling the area as \\"Pitmilly\\". They identify Hillhead, Morton, Donaldton and Kilduncan farms, as well as Pitmilly Mills, notably in the plural. In the 1926 Ordnance Survey Map, Pitmilly and the manor house grounds are shown, as are all the farms previously mentioned, except for Donaldson. The two burns are shown, but not labeled. In the 2008 version, Pitmilly House, Pitmilly Law, Hillhead, Falside (spelled with one l), Morton, Boghall, and Kilduncan are all noted. The two burns are named appropriately. Only one mill is in the area, and is shown as \\"Pitmilly Mill\\", but that structure is also known as Crail Mill. There is another mill, Hillhead Mill, in Pitmilly and it also has been called Pitmilly Mill.Gordon 1642.Blaeu 1654.Moll 1745.Ainslie 1775 Fife.Ainslie 1745 Fife and Kinross.Greenwood 1828.Thomson and Johnson 1820.Ordnance Survey 1926.Ordnance Survey 2008. shows the different naming of Pitmilly Burn and Kenly Water by individual mapmakers. In one map the two streams reach the North Sea separately. It also shows that a manor house existed at Pitmilly in 1775 and that the present farms in the region have existed for a long time, with the same names. One map refers to Pitmilly mills in the plural, which explains why two different mills have sometimes individually been referred to as Pitmilly Mill. The spelling of Pitmilly varies only slightly. In addition to Pitmilly, the name is found as Pitmilli, Pitmil (possibly as an abbreviation) and Pit Mille. The family name, Moneypenny, appears on a map in 1775. History before the arrival of the Normans Artifacts have been recovered from the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age s, indicating that Pitmilly has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic Age. BeatsonBeatson between 1791 and 1799, p.254. and Wright,Wright between 1834 and 1845, p.92. in The Statistical Accounts of Scotland of 1791-99 and 1834‚Äì45, respectively, described stone coffins, containing human bones, on the shore of Kingsbarns parish, which includes Pitmilly. They stated that the tombs were thought to be of Danes, i.e., Viking raiders, but Beatson appears dubious. From these descriptions, there is no doubt that the tombs were really Bronze Age cists. Pitmilly Law, a Bronze Age burial barrow, now with trees growing on its summit, is a local landmark on the Pitmilly estate. An article by Skinner in 1869 discusses the finding of six empty cists there.Skinner 1869. In 1867, he had discussed nearby cists on the Pitmilly estate that contained skeletons.Skinner 1867. Around 2004, an early Bronze Age cist was discovered just outside the ruins of Pitmilly House during road work; it contained a skeleton and a food vessel of the Yorkshire vase tradition.Bronze Age food vessel History Scotland Magazine, 2004. Neolithic Carved Stone Balls have been found in several locations in Scotland and in 2006 one was recovered near Pitmilly Law.TT.103/06. There appears to be no historical record, specifically, of Pitmilly from the Bronze Age to when the Normans arrived in Scotland. The Picts lived and farmed there, as nearby St Andrew developed into an important ecclesiastical center. Robert Sibbald,Sibbald 1710, p.348. writing in 1710, states that there were some obelisks of rough stone on higher ground, just south of the former site of Inchmurtach, a country residence of the Bishop of St Andrews Archbishop of St Andrews, and now the site of Kenlygreen. That location would presumably place them on the Pitmilly Estate. He quotes \\"the great antiquary, Mr. Maule\\", as believing that these were the monuments of some great men killed in battle with the Danes. This conclusion may be valid because the Danes (Vikings) frequently invaded these shores. However, it is also possible that the stones were menhirs erected by the Picts. Such stones are common in Scotland. Countess Ada and Pitmilly In the latter half of the twelfth century, Countess Ada de Warenne, William I of Scotland's mother, made two grants concerning land that she owned at Pitmilly to the St Andrews Cathedral Priory.. The first was for work on the new church and its lighting. It consisted of the annual rent for the land of one silver merk, which Countess Ada stipulated that the tenant, Malise of Pitmilly and his successors, should payCarta Comitifle Ade. de tota tra de pethmulin.Registrum Prioratius Sancti Andree, p.208. See Bruce, 1941.In her second grant, Countess Ada granted the land to the priory and its hospital (in modern terms, a boarding house for pilgrims to St Andrews)Carta Comitifle Ade de una coarca de petmulin. Registrum Prioratius Sancti Andree, p.209. See Bruce, 1841 King William subsequently confirmed both grants.Barrow, Scott 1971, charter 29, pp.139-40 and charter 170, p.233 The Hays and Pitmilly William II de Haya, the first recorded de Haya in Scotland, married Eva of Pitmilly no later than 1171.Balfour 1906, pp.555-7. Little is known about Eva, except that she was the heiress to land at Pitmilly which she brought into the marriage. However, this marriage was important because it was the beginning of the family that became Clan Hay. In 1172, William II de Haya leased one ploughgate in Pitmilly to St Andrews Cathedral Priory and its hospital for twenty years at an annual rent of half a merk of silver.Carta Willielmi de Haya de terra in Petmulyn. Registrum Prioratus Sancti Andree. p.313. See Bruce 1841 The brief association of the Hays with Pitmilly essentially ended when, shortly after William's death around 1201, Eva and their son, David, after a dispute with the canons of St Andrews Cathedral Priory, quitclaimed the land to the priory, but retained the annual rent of half a merk of silver.Barrow, Scott 1971, charter 435,1201-1205 The land in question was part of Eva's tocher (dowry) and is known to be Falside from the rubric on King William's charter. Falside still exists as a farm in Pitmilly. However, nothing remains at Pitmilly of whatever residence Eva's family occupied there, if indeed they did live there in the 12th century. The Monypennys and Pitmilly The centuries-long association of the Monypennys with Pitmilly began in 1211, when Thomas, Prior of St Andrews, granted a charter of the lands of Pitmilly to Richard Monipennie, quam Malisius tennit. The former was probably a Norman knight, while Malisius(Malise of Pitmilly)was the tenant renting the land at the time. In 1296, along with the other Scots gentry and landowners, John de Monypenny of Pitmilly signed the so-called Ragman Rolls by which he swore fealty solely to Edward I of England.Connolly 1866, p.337. Had he not done so, he would have forfeited his lands and suffered other severe penalties. There appears to be little historical record of Pitmilly, as opposed to the Moneypenny family, during the following centuries. Sibbald, writing in 1710, notes the existence of the house, one mile east of Kingsbarns, of a very ancient family of the name of Monipenny. Ainslie,Ainslie Fife 1775. in 1775, depicts on his map the square area of the grounds and house, labeling them as \\"Pitmilly Coll\\" and \\"Moneypenny\\". The Pitmilly House, of which records exist, was built in three stages.Pitmilly House,National Monuments Record of Scotland,1967. The first two, adjoining, blocks were apparently built in the 18th century. The third stage, a block added to the front of the house, was built in the typical style of a Georgian mansionGeorgian architecture in 1818, the architect being Robert Balfour of St. Andrews. National Monuments Record of Scotland have found no evidence that an earlier house stood on this specific site. However,stone wall fragments from another large structure have been described to the south-east of this housecitation required and may have been part of an earlier residence. They no longer exist. Pitmilly is not mentioned in either the 1791-99 Statistical Account of ScotlandBeatson between 1791 and 1799. or in the New Statistical Account, published between 1834 and 1845. However, Slater's Directory,Slater 1852, p.? circa 1852, mentions Pitmilly as a very ancient seat in the northern part of Kingsbarns parish, while the Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland in 1865Groome 1833-6, p.206. notes the presence of Pitmilly as an estate with a mansion. The last Monypenny to live at Pitmilly was Charlton James Blackwell Monypenny, 1867‚Äì1947, who immigrated to South America in 1902, when he is still identified as the owner. The Monypenny family later sold Pitmilly House and the farms on the estate.Macintyre 2008. Pitmilly after the Monypennys Pitmilly House was taken over during World War II as a billet for Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS).. Women who were stationed there have confirmed this.The information in this section is mainly from local sources. After the war it operated as a hotelPitmilly Hotel, Fife,1964 www.flickr.com/photos. under several owners, but ultimately these businesses failed and the house, which was said to be haunted by a particularly active poltergeist, deteriorated badly. It burned in 1967, with much of the building material subsequently being salvaged to build houses in Kingsbarns. Pitmilly now exists as good agricultural land, with the farms of the former estate still operating. Of these, Morton of Pitmilly has been renovated as a self-catering holiday resort. The most important landmark is Pitmilly Law. The ruins of two mills and of a fisherman's bothy on the estate remain. Hillhead Mill was a grist mill, on which the date 1716 is still evident, and is located at the junction of Pitmilly Burn and Kenly Water. Crail Mill was a flax mill with an adjacent miller's house (which still bears the date 1790), located a few hundred yards upstream from Hillhead Mill. There is a large, marshy pond to the west of the miller's house, probably representing the retting pond for the flax. Some confusion in nomenclature exists because both mills have on occasion been referred to individually as Pitmilly Mill. Little of Pitmilly House itself is left. Pitmilly West, built in 1975 on the site of the west gate house, operates as bed and breakfast. The other three gatehouses, the walls surrounding the grounds, pathways through the grounds, as well as ruins of the stables and the bowling alley remain. The Gate Lodge has been refurbished to a high standard; the East Lodge is in its original, Georgian, condition, while South Lodge is completely ruinous. Several photographs of the Pitmilly area as it is now can be found on Geograph Britain and Ireland at Grid Square NO5713 and adjacent squaresGeograph 2008. The local beach is unofficially called Pitmilly Beach with the Fife Coastal Path running along that beach and then entering the valley of Kenly Water, past the Pitmilly mills.

Location It is situated on Church, Road in Leyland, England just south of the B5248 in the east of Leyland, close to the West Coast Main Line, and 546 yards (500m) west of the M6. History and events =Foundation= The school was founded by Richard Balshaw in 1782. He established a high school called Golden Hill - until the 1920s that school was the original school for Balshaw's pupils. In 1922 work started on building a new school on a 5-acre site. =Grammar school= Opened in 1931, it was Balshaw's Grammar School until 1972, when after the abolition of the 11 plus exam, it became Balshaw's High School. =Comprehensive= In 1972 the school partnered with Parklands High School opening Runshaw College, joining to combine both the schools' sixth forms. The school later abandoned its Grammar status in favour of comprehensive status in September 1972, becoming Balshaw's High School. In 1994 the school became a Church of England school. = Newer expansions =  2013  * Construction of the 3G Astro multi-sport pitch began after students fund-raised for the area.  2014  * Construction of the 3G Astro was completed before the new intake arrived.  2016  * A new PE building was constructed which housed a fitness suite and PE office as well as new corridors to make access around the department easier. * Old corridors and areas in the PE and Drama departments such as the backstage passages and storage rooms were renovated along with the re-modeling of the Old Gym into a new dance studio. The changing rooms were also greatly improved and toilets were added. * Fire systems were fully replaced with new smoke detectors and alarms in every room. Strobe lights were also added in areas where the alarms may not be able to be heard such as music rooms. * New electronic door access systems were installed along with basic CCTV  2017  * New equipment for the music department such as new music instruments for practice rooms and recording rooms. * The music department was planned to be fully expanded in 2017 but plans were later scrapped  2018  * New IT upgrades such as new computers began, many old computers from the school's main computer rooms were removed and replaced with new all-in-one desktop PCs running Windows 10.  2019  * New security fencing was erected outside the school and CCTV coverage was increased. Traditions =House system= The school is split into traditional houses. The house system consists of all years, all of which have four divisions (see below). These divisions are named after four areas of Lancashire, and are managed by learning managers. The houses are managed by separate staff: * Cuerden - Mrs Coburn * Farington - Mr Riley * Worden - Mr Jennings * Clayton - Mr Holland Headteachers Jo Venn finished her stint as headteacher at the end of the 2014 spring term; having been in the position from 1995 where she took over from Paul Ingram. Venn was the first female headteacher throughout the school's history. From September 2014, Steven Haycocks became headteacher, making him the first new headteacher in 20 years. School mottos Former grammar school pre-1931 The school motto is Non Sibi Sed Aliis which is Latin for \\"Not for oneself, but for others\\". However the school has now adopted the somewhat common motto \\"Aiming at Excellence\\". Another commonly used motto used within the school, primarily during assemblies, is \\"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all\\". Ofsted inspections The school was formally inspected by the HM Inspectorate of Schools on Thursday 4 June 2009, the previous one being in 2006, and achieved 'Good' status. The latest inspection took place in 2013 where the school was promoted to 'Outstanding' status. Eco-Schools Balshaw's is part of the Eco-Schools scheme in Lancashire. This came with a lot of development, by way of recording waste usage, electricity, gas, and how well the school does economically with regard to funds, budgets and the environment. This meant creating new targets and innovating energy use for better sustainability. On 2 July 2009, the first Eco event held was an \\"Eco-Day\\", in which the pupils worked with eco-friendly materials and learnt about how to lead environmentally friendly lifestyles. Subsequent to this, further Eco events and projects have been held. One of the recent events was their Eco Garden Party in 2014.

In the old times, under Pan Geng of the Shang Dynasty, the capital had been transferred for five times; under King Cheng of Zhou, the capital had been transferred for three times. It was not for personal benefits that the kings moved the capital. They did so in order to pursue great causes, choosing the central place, making it favourable for future generations to thrive, that was in respect to the Mandate of Heaven and in accordance with the commons, moving to a place to ensure the eternal existence of the nation and the richness of customs. But now the ƒêinh and the L√™ disregarded the heavenly mandate and did not follow the examples of the Shang and Zhou, just fixing the capital here which causes the shortness of the nation, the people's depletion and the discord of the universe. We are very painful and now thinking of transferring the capital. > Hu·ªëng h·ªì th√†nh ƒê·∫°i La l√† ƒë√¥ c≈© c·ªßa Cao v∆∞∆°ng, ·ªü gi·ªØa khu v·ª±c tr·ªùi ƒë·∫•t, ƒë∆∞·ª£c > th·∫ø r·ªìng ch·∫ßu h·ªï ph·ª•c, ch√≠nh gi·ªØa Nam B·∫Øc ƒê√¥ng T√¢y, ti·ªán nghi n√∫i s√¥ng sau > tr∆∞·ªõc.

He participated in the Alsos Mission, which conducted a series of operations with the intent to place all uranium in Europe into Allied hands, and at the end of the war rounded up German atomic scientists to keep them out of the Soviet Union. He personally escorted half of the uranium-235 necessary for the Little Boy atomic bomb to the Pacific island of Tinian. He was also a key figure overseeing the construction of The Pentagon building. After the war he founded Furman Builders Inc., a construction company that built hundreds of structures, including the Potomac Mills shopping mall in Woodbridge, Virginia. Early life Robert Ralph Furman was born on August 21, 1915, in Trenton, New Jersey, one of five sons of William and Leila Ficht Furman. His father was a bank teller, and his mother worked as a riveter during World War II. He attended Princeton University and graduated in 1937 with a degree in civil engineering. He then worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad and a construction company in New York. World War II In December 1940, Furman was activated as a member of the United States Army Reserve and assigned to the Quartermaster Corps Construction Division, where he worked for Colonel Leslie R. Groves, Jr., supervising the day-to-day construction of The Pentagon. When the building was completed in 1943, Groves was reassigned to the \\"Manhattan Project\\" and brought his aide, Furman, with him. In August 1943 Furman was put in charge of an intelligence effort formed by Groves in response to concerns raised by atomic bomb project scientists about the German nuclear energy project. As director of intelligence, Furman was responsible for ascertaining the progress the Germans were making. In December 1943, Groves sent Furman to Britain to discuss the establishment of a London Liaison Office for the Manhattan Project and the British government, and to confer over coordinating the intelligence effort. Furman sent the spy Moe Berg to Switzerland to meet the head of the German project, Werner Heisenberg. After chatting with Heisenberg at a cocktail party, Berg concluded that the Germans were a long way behind the Allied effort. Furman travelled to Rome in June 1944, where he interviewed Italian scientists about the German project. When the Alsos Mission found documentation in office of Union Mini√®re in Antwerp that indicated over 1,000 tons of refined uranium had been sent to Germany, but about 150 tons still remained at Olen, Belgium, Groves sent Furman back to Europe with orders to secure the Olen cache. The Alsos Mission located 68 tons there, but another 80 tons was missing, having been shipped to France in 1940 ahead of the German invasion of Belgium. Groves had the Olen uranium shipped to England and, ultimately, to the United States. Documentation indicated that the missing uranium had been sent to Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Boris Pash's command reached Toulouse on October 1 and inspected a French Army arsenal with a Geiger counter. When the needle jumped near some barrels, they were inspected and found to be the 31 tons of uranium from Belgium. The 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company was released from the Red Ball Express to retrieve the shipment. The barrels were collected and transported to Marseilles, where Furman supervised their loading on a ship bound for the United States. In April 1945, Furman participated in Operation Harborage. The Alsos Mission and the 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion occupied Haigerloch, where they found and destroyed a German experimental nuclear reactor, and recovered uranium and heavy water. The Alsos Mission took Heisenberg into custody on May 2. Furman supervised his detention and that of nine other German scientists, who were taken to Rheims, then Versailles, and finally to the country estate of Farm Hall in England, where their conversations were monitored and where they could not defect to the Soviet Union. In July 1945, Furman personally escorted half of the uranium-235 necessary for the Little Boy atomic bomb to the Pacific island of Tinian. Accompanied by Captain James F. Nolan, a radiologist with Project Alberta, Furman set out by car from Santa Fe to Albuquerque on July 14, then travelled by air to Hamilton Field, California. The men boarded the cruiser at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, and crossed the Pacific to Tinian, arriving on July 26. A few days after leaving Tinian, the Indianapolis was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine with the loss of over 800 men. Later life Furman left the army the year after the war ended and founded Furman Builders Inc. in Rockville, Maryland. The firm built hundreds of homes, schools and commercial buildings, including the Potomac Mills shopping mall in Woodbridge, Virginia, the Metropolitan Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., and the United States embassy in Nicaragua. He married Mary Eddy in 1952. They had four children: a son, David, and three daughters, Martha Keating, Julia Costello and Serena Furman. For the most part, Furman kept quiet about his exploits during the war. He served as president of the local rotary club and sang baritone in a barbershop quartet. He retired in 1993, and died of metastatic melanoma on October 14, 2008 at Buckingham's Choice retirement community in Adamstown, Maryland at the age of 93.

The Book of Truth and Facts (originally published as Germans as Exponents of Culture) was originally released in 1914 by Friedrich Wilhelm von Frantzius. It was published during World War I and functioned as a piece of pro-German propaganda. The booklet was written in response to an article entitled \\"Germans as Exponents of Culture\\" penned by Brander Matthews, which appeared in the September 20, 1914 edition of the New York Times2. Von Frantzius‚Äôs goal in writing the book was to \\"enlighten the American people on conditions, not only in Germany, but also in the United States and England, and to acquaint them with German ideals, which are so grossly misunderstood in this country [America]\\". The main argument is that Germans possess culture, or \\"Kultur\\", that all other countries lack. He argues that \\"there is a great difference between 'civilization' and 'Kultur.' Many nations are highly civilized, but to have 'Kultur' means to possess deep conscience and high morale, and a philosophical conception of life.\\" Von Frantzius broke down the booklet into three themes: German Achievements, English Culture, and American Culture. He further elaborated on the German Achievements by specifying nine areas: Philosophy, Science, Art, Inventions, Discoveries, Finance, Commerce, Administration, and Legislation. Three deeply resonating themes occur throughout the piece: German superiority, British inferiority, and American dependence. Von Frantzius argued that the German people, through the achievements of their culture, have gained a superior status to that of the English. He claims that Germans within the last eighty years have the greatest inventions, educational structures, artistically creative minds, and developments in scientific research and discoveries. He asserts that these achievements \\"signify the greatest process in culture ever made by any nation within any such brief space of time\\". He uses these arguments to enforce the idea of German superiority and English inferiority. Because of the lack of sustaining culture within American society, von Frantzius maintains that Americans were led into a state of dependence on the British. Von Frantzius stresses the American dependence on British culture during World War I. One of the most prevailing dependencies discussed is American reliance on English media. He describes the lack of German media within the American social structure, declaring \\"we really have no American press in the United States to-day, but an English one which is decidedly anti- German\\". He explains that all other areas of American life are influenced greatly by the British and that Americans could benefit from a stronger influence of German \\"Kultur\\". References 1\\\\.

The texts were obtained by illegal excavation, probably of a tomb in the area of Hubei or Hunan province, and were then acquired and donated to the university by an alumnus. The very large size of the collection and the significance of the texts for scholarship make it one of the most important discoveries of early Chinese texts to date. On 7 January 2014 the journal Nature announced that a portion of the Tsinghua Bamboo Slips represent \\"the world's oldest example\\" of a decimal multiplication table. Discovery, conservation and publication The Tsinghua Bamboo Slips (TBS) were donated to Tsinghua University in July 2008 by an alumnus of the university. The precise location(s) and date(s) of the illicit excavation that yielded the slips remain(s) unknown. An article in the Guangming Daily named the donor as Zhao Weiguo (), and stated that the texts were purchased at \\"a foreign auction\\", Neither the name of the auction house, nor the location or sum involved in the transaction were mentioned. Li Xueqin, the director of the conservation and research project, has stated that the wishes of the alumnus to maintain his identity secret will be respected. Similarities with previous discoveries, such as the manuscripts from the Guodian tomb, indicate that the TBS came from a mid-to-late Warring States Period (480‚Äì221BC) tomb in the region of China culturally dominated at that time by the Chu state. A single radiocarbon date (305¬±30BC) and the style of ornament on the accompanying box are in keeping with this conclusion. By the time they reached the university, the slips were badly affected by mold. Conservation work on the slips was carried out, and a Center for Excavated Texts Research and Preservation was established at Tsinghua on April 25, 2009. There are 2388 slips altogether in the collection, including a number of fragments. A series of articles discussing the TBS, intended for an educated but non-specialist Chinese audience, appeared in the Guangming Daily during late 2008 and 2009. The first volume of texts (photographic reproductions, transcriptions, and commentary) was published by the Tsinghua team in 2010.Li Xueqin (2010). A 2013 article in The New York Times reported on the TBS's importance to understanding the Chinese classics.Didi Kirsten Tatlow (2013-7-10). Rare Record of Chinese Classics Discovered, The New York Times. Sarah Allan, a sinologist at Dartmouth College, stressed the significance of the circa 305 BC date when the bamboo manuscripts were buried, about 100 years before Qin Shi Huang conducted a \\"literary holocaust\\" with the (213‚Äì210 BC) burning of books and burying of scholars. Professor Allan said that, in predating that textual censorship, \\"(t)hese manuscripts speak directly to the core issues of the Chinese intellectual tradition and were recorded at the height of the formative period.\\" \\"The classics are all political\\", Li Xueqin commented: \\"It would be like finding the original Bible or the 'original' classics. It enables us to look at the classics before they were turned into 'classics.' The questions now include, what were they in the beginning, and how they became what they are?\\" The texts Several of the TBS texts are similar to the received Shang Shu, a miscellany of documents from various dates in the first millennium BC that were transmitted as a canonical collection from the Han dynasty onwards. In some cases, a TBS text can be found in the received Shang Shu, with only variations in wording, title or orthography. Such examples include versions of the \\"Jin Teng\\" (), \\"Kang Gao\\" () and \\"Gu Ming\\" () chapters of the Shang Shu. The majority of Shang Shu-style TBS texts, however, are not found in the received Shang Shu, either having been \\"lost\\" in the process of transmission, or else never having been incorporated into the canonical collection. An annalistic history () recording events from the beginning of the Western Zhou (mid-11th century BC) through to the early Warring States period (mid-5th century) is said to be similar in form and content to the received Bamboo Annals. Another text running across 14 slips recounts a celebratory gathering of the Zhou elite in the 8th year of the reign of King Wu of Zhou, prior to their conquest of the Shang dynasty. The gathering takes place in the ancestral temple of King Wen of Zhou, King Wu's father, and consisted of beer drinking and the recitation of hymns in the style of the received Shi Jing. =The Admonition of Protection= Among the TBS texts in the style of the received Shang Shu, is one that has been titled \\"The Admonition of Protection\\" (\\"Bao Xun\\" ‰øùË®ì). This was the first text for which anything approaching a complete description and transcription was published. The text purports to be a record of a deathbed admonition by the Zhou king Wen Wang to his son and heir, Wu Wang. Although the team working on the text refers to it as \\"The Admonition of Protection\\" (or \\"Protector's Admonition\\", ‰øùËÆ≠), their transcription of the text refers to a \\"Precious Admonition\\" (Bao Xun) and that may be the more appropriate editorial title. The content of the king's speech revolves around a concept of The Middle (Zhong ‰∏≠) which seems to refer to an avoidance of extremes and an ability to consider diverse points of view. The king narrates a story of the sage-king Shun acquiring The Middle by living a modest, thoughtful life, and a more puzzling second tale which describes the Shang ancestor Wei () \\"borrowing The Middle from the River.\\" =Xinian= \\"Xinian\\" Áπ´Âπ¥ (Á≥ªÂπ¥), probably composed ca. 370 BC, relates key events of Zhou history.

Decimal multiplication table The world's earliest artifacts of decimal multiplication table Twenty-one bamboo slips of the Tsinghua Bamboo Slips, when assembled in the correct order, represent a decimal multiplication table that can be used to multiply numbers (any whole or half integer) up to 99.5. Joseph Dauben from the City University of New York called it \\"the earliest artefact of a decimal multiplication table in the world\\". According to Guo Shuchun, director of the Chinese Society of the History of Mathematics, those slips filled a historical gap for mathematical documents prior to the Qin Dynasty. It is presumed that officials used the multiplication table to calculate land surface area, yields of crops and the amounts of taxes owed.

The Hall of Science building was the largest capital building project in the history of the CSULB campus and most expensive building project in the CSU system. Enrollment at CSULB was 34,500 when Alexander took office, and it increased by more than 2,000 students by 2012. At the same time that Alexander oversaw an increase in the student body, he oversaw a 12% decrease in the total number of faculty from 2185 in Spring 2006 to 1890 in Spring 2013.

Workplace aggression can include a wide range of behaviors, ranging from verbal acts (e.g., insulting someone or spreading rumors) to physical attacks (e.g., punching or slapping). Workplace aggression can decrease the ability of a person to do their job well, lead to physical declines in health and mental health problems, and can also change the way a person behaves at their home. If someone experiencing aggression at work, it may result in an increase in missed days (absence from work) and some may decide to leave their positions. Definition Aggression, in general, is any behavior an individual carries out with the intent to harm another person or group of people. The aggressor must believe that their behavior is harmful to their target, and that the target is motivated to avoid this behavior. International Labour Organization definition of workplace violence as \\"any action, incident or behaviour that departures from reasonable conduct in which a person is threatened, harmed, injured in the course of, or as a direct result of, his or her work\\". A defining feature of aggression is the intent or motivation to harm. For a behavior to be considered an aggressive act, the individual committing the behavior must intend harm. In other words, if they inflict harm on another without that specific intent, it is not considered aggression. Aggression can occur in a variety of situations. One important domain to understand aggression is in the workplace. Workplace aggression is considered a specific type of counterproductive work behavior (CWB) and is defined as \\"any act of aggression, physical assault, threatening or coercive behavior that causes physical or emotional harm in a work setting.\\" Some researchers specify that workplace aggression only includes efforts to harm coworkers, former coworkers, current employers, or past employers. Others include in workplace aggression any behaviors intended to harm another person that are enacted in a workplace. Classification To delineate the range of behaviors that can be considered aggressive workplace behaviors, researchers have developed schemes of classification for workplace aggression. Neuman and Baron (1998) offer these three dimensions that encompass the range of workplace aggression: # Expressions of hostility ‚Äì behaviors that are primarily verbal or symbolic in nature # Obstructionism ‚Äì behaviors intended to hinder an employee from performing their job or the organization from accomplishing its objectives # Overt aggression ‚Äì violent acts In an attempt to further break down the wide range of aggressive workplace behaviors, Baron and Neuman (1996) also classify workplace aggression based on these three dichotomies: # Verbal‚Äìphysical # Direct‚Äìindirect # Active‚Äìpassive Aggressive acts can take any possible combination of these three dichotomies. For example, failing to deny false rumors about a coworker would be classified as verbal‚Äìpassive‚Äìindirect. Purposely avoiding the presence of a coworker you know is searching for your assistance could be considered physical‚Äìpassive‚Äìdirect. Other researchers offer a classification system based on the aggressor's relationship to the victim. # Criminal intent (Type I) ‚Äì this type of aggression occurs when the aggressor has no relationship to the victim or organization. # Customer/client (Type II) ‚Äì the aggressor has a relationship with the organization and aggresses while they are being served as a customer. # Worker on worker (Type III) ‚Äì both the aggressor and the victim are employees in the same organization. Often, the aggressor is a supervisor, and the victim is a subordinate. # Personal relationship (Type IV) ‚Äì the aggressor has a relationship with an employee at an organization, but not the organization itself. This category includes victims who are assaulted by a domestic partner while at work. Covert nature In the workplace much of the aggressive behavior enacted on targets are considered covert in nature. According to Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Hjelt-Back, covert behaviors are those behaviors that are designed to disguise the aggressive behavior or aggressive intentions from the target. Overt aggression, on the other hand, includes behaviors that do not hide the aggressive intent and are open in their intentions. Typically, covert aggression is verbal, indirect, and passive in nature, while overt aggression reflects the physical, direct, and active side of the dichotomies. Workplace aggression often takes the form of covert behaviors. This can be attributed to what Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Lagerspetz call the effect/danger ratio. This term refers to the aggressors' subjective evaluation of the relative effects and danger of committing an aggressive act. For an aggressor, it is ideal to have a larger effect/danger ratio. In other words, aggressors want an act to have a large effect with relatively low risk of danger to themselves. Individuals in the workplace are subjected to prolonged exposure to each other. This prolonged exposure means the victims of the aggressors' actions likely have more time to retaliate, thus increasing the danger aspect of the ratio. Also, workplaces are often communal in nature. That is, people often work in groups and are surrounded by others. The presence of others acts as a built in audience that could \\"punish\\" the aggressor for harming a victim. It is for these reasons that individuals often choose covert forms of aggression. Predictors (antecedents) Predictors of workplace aggression can occur at both the organizational level and the individual level. Organizational factors examined here include organizational justice, supervision and surveillance, changes in the work environment, and specific job characteristics. At the individual level, gender, age, and alcohol consumption are examined here. While this is not a comprehensive listing of predictors, it does cover the majority of workplace aggression predictors addressed in the empirical literature. =Organizational (in)justice= Perceived interpersonal justice, the degree to which people feel they are treated with fairness and respect, is negatively related to both psychological and physical aggression against supervisors. Inness, Barling, and Turner found similar results; perceived interpersonal injustice was related to workplace aggression in participants' primary and secondary jobs. Moreover, perceived procedural justice, the extent to which formal organizational procedures are assumed fair, is related to workplace aggression against supervisors. Greenberg and Barling found that the greater the perceptions of procedural justice, the less workplace aggression was reported. = Termination and job security = The most extreme forms of workplace aggression may result from personnel decisions, such as individual termination and mass layoffs. In 2009 a man killed one and wounded five others at his former place of employment two years after he was let go from the company due to poor performance. A similar event occurred in 2012 when a man shot and killed four employees and then himself after losing his job earlier that day. Downsizing is a tactic used by organizations where there is a slow-down in business in order to remain profitable or minimize losses. This tactic is most commonly observed during widespread economic hardships, such as the Great Recession of 2008. Perceived job insecurity, or feelings of impending termination, has been found to be a predictor of workplace aggression. =Supervision and surveillance= Workplace surveillance (employee monitoring) is positively related to workplace aggression against supervisors, such that the greater the number of employee surveillance methods used, the greater the amount of workplace aggression. Furthermore, supervisory control over work performance has also been shown positively related to workplace aggression against supervisors. This type of behavior has been observed both adults and teenagers. =Workplace changes= Baron and Neuman found that certain changes in the work environment can lead to increased aggression that they attribute to heightened anxiety and stress. Specifically, pay cuts or freezes, changes in management, increased monitoring systems (e.g., increased computer monitoring), increased diversity, and the increased use of part-time employees all were related to higher levels of workplace aggression. =Job- specific characteristics= Other antecedents of workplace aggression found in the literature are specific job characteristics. LeBlanc and Kelloway found that certain job features, such as handling guns or collecting valuable items, were significantly more related to workplace aggression. =Time spent at work= Harvey and Keashly found that length of time at work was able to predict workplace aggression such that the longer hours a person worked, the more likely they were to report aggression. The authors attributed this finding to two possible reasons. First, the more hours worked, the greater statistical probability of being victimized. Second, longer hours worked could contribute to fatigue and frustration. This in turn may increase the likelihood of aggressive actions towards coworkers. =Gender= In some studies, gender has been shown a significant predictor of workplace aggression. For example, being male is significantly related to reports of aggression against supervisors. Furthermore, males are more likely to commit aggressive acts in the presence of other men. This can be attributed to societal cultures that dictate \\"codes of honor.\\" Females, on the other hand, are no more likely to act aggressively in either the presence of females or males. =Age= Age is significantly related to aggression. In their study of age and job performance, Ng and Feldman found that older workers (age 40 or older) engaged in less workplace aggression than younger workers. =Alcohol consumption= The frequency and amount of alcohol typically consumed by a person predicts aggressive behavior. Those who consume more alcohol more frequently are more likely to aggress against a coworker. The Hebei tractor rampage began as workplace aggression following alcohol consumption. Cyber- aggression Cyber-aggression or cyber-harassment: What many do not realize that the phenomenon of cyber-bullying often associated with teenage culture has spread to the workplace in a variety of ways. While this trend is seemingly silent and slow growing, its effects are considered equally hurtful as any form of harassment. Often, cyber-aggression is the result of individuals in a workplace being offended/upset/or feeling threatened by organizational problems. They then resort to virtual communication as a form of retaliation. These actions are referred to as flaming by Whitty & Carr, or essentially when an individual online writes with hostility towards a particular person or group of people. =Instant messaging= Instant messaging has become both a help and a hindrance in organizations.Greengard, Samuel. \\"IM speeds workplace communication, but it can also spell trouble.\\" Workforce Management July 2003: 84-85 The ease of use with instant messaging, is partially to blame, \\"Employees can see who else is available, and if it‚Äôs someone they want to talk to, they‚Äôre able to connect in real time\\". While this has become an extremely useful tool in workplace communication, instant messengers such at AIM or MSN Messenger are not easily regulated from a managerial aspect, which leads to employees being able to have private conversations on a public platform. These conversations can foster aggressive talk and lead to potentially hurtful information being spread among an organization. Some argue that instant messages are beneficial to the work process because it can easily resolve problems without having to distract the person via phone and you don‚Äôt have to wait for an email response. =Email= This is one of the most prevalent tools used in cyber-aggression because of its prevalence in workplace communications.Lacey, Hoda. \\"\\"E\\" is for etiquette when sending emails.\\" Travel Trade Gazette 13 May 2005: 51.Sanders, Claire. \\"Want to tell a lie? Put it in email.\\" The Times Higher Education Supplement 20 Jan. 2007: 1. Often upset workers send loaded messages and attach the email to a large group of co-workers that are not involved in the issue to bring attention to it. An article from the Travel Trade Gazette give some advice to avoid being aggressive in emails. * Always give a clear subject * State exactly what you need in a simple manner * Avoid terms like ASAP * Only use reply all when it refers to the whole group * Using all upper case is electronic SHOUTING! * Don‚Äôt use texting lexicon * Never send an email when you are upset =Social networking= This is one of the fastest growing ways that workers can lash out against each other. The opportunity is high for individuals to be aggressive in a highly public and open forum. Many choose to speak out at their co-workers or superiors because it is a way for them to vent their feelings while not having to say these things face to face. Outcomes Like the array of behaviors considered workplace aggression, the consequences of workplace aggression are also extensive. For example, Ng and Feldman suggest that \\"acts of workplace aggression can cause bodily harm to employees, pose physical danger for customers, create public relations crises, and harm the business reputation of the firm as a whole.\\" The outcomes of workplace aggression addressed here include the health and well-being of targeted employees and job performance. Gender differences in outcomes are also addressed. Severity of the repercussions may be influenced by the position of the aggressor. Hershcovis and Barling found that \\"...supervisor aggression has the strongest adverse effects across attitudinal and behavioral outcomes\\", followed by co-worker aggression and outsider aggression. =Health and well-being= Workplace aggression can have devastating effects on an organization's employees. For example, it has been found that targets of workplace aggression report lower levels of well-being. Other studies have shown that aggression in the workplace can cause the victims of such behaviors to suffer from health problems and displaced aggression - including perpetuating aggression towards random strangers in the street. Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Hjelt-Back even found that targets exhibited symptoms similar to those of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as anxiety and depression. . Sorensen et al. found possible associations between harassment at work and well-being measures of lower back pain and sleep deficiency among a sample of hospital workers. =Team performance= Research has looked at the negative impacts of workplace aggression on team performance and particularly team effectiveness as was evidenced in a recent study by Aube and Rousseau. =Job satisfaction= Victims of workplace aggression may suffer from reduced job satisfaction. Lapierre, Spector, and Leck found that those who perceived being targets of workplace aggression reported significantly lower overall job satisfaction. Similarly, those who perceive abuse from their supervisors report lower levels of job satisfaction. =Gender differences in outcomes= Research has shown that males and females react to workplace aggression differently. While both males and females have reported lower well- being after experiencing aggression in the workplace, studies indicate that the relationship between experienced workplace aggression and decreased well- being was stronger for men. In one study, results showed that men who experienced work aggression were more likely to report physical, psychosocial, affective, and cognitive problems. This study also showed that the type of aggression, whether it is overt or covert, did not matter for these outcomes. The study attributes these findings to the idea of modern-day masculinity, which stresses achievement and success in the workplace. For females, nonsexual aggression has been found to have a stronger impact on job satisfaction than sexual aggression. Also, nonsexual aggression has a stronger relationship with job satisfaction in females than in males. Prevention Prevention programs focus on reducing instances of workplace aggression. Programs that incorporate personnel selection, organizational sanctions, and training are recommended. =Personnel selection= Based on a workplace prevention program developed by the United States Postal Service (USPS), Neuman and Baron encourage organizations to use personnel screening and testing to identify potential employees who are likely to behave aggressively before they are even hired. This proactive strategy prevents individuals who are predisposed to aggress from even entering the workplace. =Organizational sanctions= Explicit policies regarding workplace aggression may help organizations to reduce aggression. Employees who perceived that their organization would punish workplace aggressors reported less workplace aggression even when their perceptions of interpersonal justice were high. Neuman and Baron also suggest using organizational policies to curb workplace aggression and to shape strong anti-aggressive organizational norms. =Training= Training has been shown to improve healthcare professionals knowledge, however may not help reduce how often healthcare workers experience aggressive bevhaviour. Neuman and Baron suggest that training for both supervisors and subordinates should focus on teaching employees methods for dealing with aggression. Similarly, Rai advises that appropriate training should inform employees that management takes threats seriously, encourage employees to report incidents, and demonstrate management's commitment to deal with reported incidents. = Organizational support = Organizational support can influence the effects of workplace aggression. Schat and Kelloway isolated two forms of organizational support: instrumental and informational. Instrumental support refers to providing some type of assistance directly to an afflicted individuals, whereas information support refers to providing employees with self-help informational resources.

An autopsy determined that he likely died of injuries due to a fall from a tree. Disappearance On October 13, 2008, Crisp was involved in an argument with his parents over what they described as obsessive playing of the video game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare on his Xbox 360, after they took the system away. Brandon filled a yellow and grey backpack with clothes and left home riding his bicycle.CityNews: Missing Teen's Backpack Not Found, Despite Reports , Citynews.ca. Retrieved on 2008-11-05 His parents allowed him to leave and expected \\"he would be home later that day with his tail between his legs\\". According to police, two witnesses claimed to have last seen him on a trail near Shanty Bay, Ontario. The first reported that he had seen him having mechanical trouble with his bicycle on the trail. The second witness reported seeing Crisp later walking along the trail further east, but due to communications mix-ups this information was not passed along to searchers until the end of October. Crisp's missing person file was flagged nationally by the Canadian Police Information Centre. Crisp's parents reported him to Barrie Police Service as missing on the morning of October 14. Police began their search October 18, using heat-sensitive cameras and officers with the K-9 unit. On October 20, police located his mountain bike, which had been abandoned near where he was last witnessed. Concerned members of the public organized their own search parties, at times consisting of more than 1,600 individuals, some from areas as far away as London, Ontario.AFP: Microsoft offers reward for missing Xbox gamer , Afp.google.com. Retrieved on 2008-11-05 On October 27, Microsoft announced that they would be adding C$25,000 of matching funds to the reward already offered by a local newspaper and the Crisps' Internet service provider, bringing the total reward to $50,000. As the ground searches were progressing, there was also speculation that Crisp had been lured by a fellow Xbox Live player, despite there being no evidence for this; Microsoft offered assistance to the police effort by helping to identify players on Crisp's online friends list. Death Police ended the ground search for Crisp on October 30, 2008, but made clear that the investigation was on-going and continuing around-the-clock. One week later, on November 5, hunters discovered Crisp's body in an overgrown area near what had been the police search area. An autopsy confirmed the identity of the teen via dental records and determined the cause of death to be \\"injuries to the chest area that are consistent with a fall from a tree\\". Barrie Police noted that no foul play was suspected, and that the investigation was ongoing to determine an exact timeline. Although a police spokesman stated \\"We're doing the best to come up with the answers everybody wants\\", no further details or updates have been released to the public. Media coverage and response Within a week of Brandon Crisp's disappearance the case received significant media coverage throughout Ontario. Toronto-based outlets such as The Toronto Star, Citytv, CP24, and others covered the story, and national outlets such as the National Post, CTV and CBC soon picked it up as well. A Facebook page started by Brandon's classmates at St. Joseph's Catholic High School in Barrie, titled \\"Where is Brandon Crisp\\", grew to almost 22,000 members by the time his body was found. The news of the discovery of Brandon Crisp's body made national news throughout Canada, with coverage on all major TV networks and national newspapers. The Toronto Sun published it as the front-page headline and picture on November 6, 2008. Thousands of people also flooded the Facebook group and other internet forums with expressions of grief and sympathy for the family. The story generated Internet coverage from bloggers and others trying to help find Crisp, such as the creation of the now-defunct website findbrandoncrisp.com, discussions of the video game related issues, and discussions of how the tragedy emotionally affected the community, police involved, and even strangers. The report of Crisp's death generated an amount of anonymous internet trolling, with many messages and photos posted to the Facebook group that most group members and friends found to be upsetting and disturbing, resulting in the group being shut down; an example of what Mattathias Schwartz of The New York Times has called \\"Malwebolence\\". Brandon Crisp was buried in Barrie on November 14, 2008, in a service attended by more than 1,700 fellow students, friends, family, and community members. National media covered the service, featured as the lead-item on most Ontario newscasts. The Crisp family has created the Brandon Crisp Endowment Fund, working with Canadian Tire's JumpStart charity program for assisting families in financial need to participate in minor sports and recreational activities. By October 2009 over $140,000 has been raised. Crisp's story continues to be referenced in discussions about video game addiction and influence, with debate about whether his obsession with Call of Duty actually was a contributing factor to his death, or whether this case was just a tragedy that began with an ordinary teen-parent argument.www.cbc.ca Jesse Brown Podcast On March 6, 2009, the CBC's national news program The Fifth Estate aired an hour- long report on video game addiction and the Brandon Crisp story, titled \\"Top Gun: When a video gaming obsession turns to addiction and tragedy\\".

The son of a Greek immigrant, he grew up on the Wyoming prairie until the age of 10 when his family moved to Oakland, California. Eventually they settled in Modesto, California. Forakis was in the Merchant Marines from 1945-50. He served in the US. Military in Korea and Japan from 1951-53. He earned his B.F.A. at the California School of Fine Arts (San Francisco Art Institute) in 1957. Art In 1955 Forakis created the poster for the Six Gallery reading by Allen Ginsberg, Philip Lamantia, Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen, MCed by Kenneth Rexroth. In 1958 Forakis moved to New York City. It was during this time in New York in the late 1950s-1960s that Forakis emerged as a prominent member of the art world, and, along with artists Mark di Suvero, Ed Ruda, Dean Fleming, Robert Grosvenor, Anthony Magar, Tamara Melcher, Forrest ‚ÄúFrosty‚Äù Myers, David Novros and Leo Valledor, he founded the Park Place Gallery (1963‚Äì67), a unique artists‚Äô co-op space. Park Place became the prototype for experimental art spaces of the 1970s. Forakis was a ceaseless experimenter and was conducting his own research during the Park Place Gallery time period. Although he began as a painter, his paintings became sculpture. His work quickly evolved in a 3-dimensional direction, with a seminal series of ‚Äú3D paintings‚Äù (1959‚Äì62) consisting of brightly painted abstract constructions made from mostly found timber which literally ‚Äúcame off the wall.‚Äù Sadly, few of these works remain. Forakis became fascinated by geometry and his focus became sculptural. San Francisco Chronicle Art critic Kenneth Baker credits Forakis as the ‚Äúoriginator of geometry-based sculpture from the 60s‚Äù. In an article by Joanne Dickson titled ‚ÄúProfile: Peter Forakis‚Äù in the Winter 1981 edition of Ocular Magazine Forakis said, ‚ÄúGeometry‚Ä¶is a natural law that exists not only in my thinking and my blood, bones, and marrow, but in the universe and all its matter.‚Äù Forakis embarked on his lifelong exploration of the cube and hypercube along with Four-Dimensional theories. Since the late 1950s Peter Forakis has been a prolific producer of sculpture based on geometric shapes such as cubes, spheres, octahedrons and rhomboids. Some of his best known pieces include Daedules & Icarus (1963), Magic Box (1966) and Hyper Cube,1967 (Walker Art Center). In 1967 Forakis received his first monumental scale commission. Atlanta Gateway, one of the largest existing works of modern sculpture anywhere measuring 100 feet by 200 feet by 100 feet of tubular steel, spans a major traffic artery in Atlanta, Georgia‚Äôs Southwest Industrial Park. By the early 1970s Forakis had begun experimenting with his ‚Äúslots‚Äù technique, one of his signature achievements notable both as a unique language of examining geometry and for fabricating large scale works in steel without welding. Cutting slots into steel and sliding sheets together allowed large sculptures to be assembled using only gravity and the weight of the material. Archimedes Cube, (series, beginning in 1968) a signature piece for Forakis, has no welds, only slots. Of his monumental slotted sculptures are Sokar: the Egyptian Key (1974), and Jack London (1982) owned by the Oakland Museum and located in the Oakland Estuary, Oakland, California. He exhibited his work in major sculpture exhibitions in museums including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) 1967 American Sculpture of the Sixties exhibition. His work has been seen on both coasts, across the US, and in Europe and Asia. He also won numerous grants.

The film starred Makhanlal Bannerjee, Mohan Sundar Deb Goswami, Krishnachandra Singh, and Prabhavati. It premiered 28 April 1936 at the Laxmi Talkies of Puri. Sita Bibaha was the first complete Oriya film and an important part of the struggle for a manifestation of Oriya cultural identity in celluloid form. The film was a commercial success. The two-hour movie was subsequently released at Cinema Palace in Cuttack. It also drew numerous crowds at several touring assignments such as the \\"Radhakishen Chamelia Touring Cinema\\". The second Oriya film was produced in 1949. Production The film was sponsored by the Calcutta-based Kali Film Studio and cost Rs. Thirty thousand (30,000). Mohan Sundar as the producer then had to seek loans to pay the artists. According to the vouchers signed by the artists, Makhanlal (Ram) had received Rs 120 on 30 October 1935. Adaita Ballabha Mohanty (Laxman) was paid just Rs 35 as a conveyance fee. Actress Miss Prabhabati (Sita) received the highest among the lot, Rs 150. The total expenditure incurred to make the first commercial movie in the history of Odisha was Rs 29,781 and 10 anna. The picture was subjected to Bengal Board of Film Certificate and the police commissioner of Lal Bazaar awarded it the censor certificate.Sita Bibaha, The First Cinema  Orissa Cinema  Odisha Ollywood Performance The performance of Narasingha Nandasharma as the boatman as well as Makhanlal Banerjee as Sri Ram were well received. Fourteen songs encapsulated in the movie amidst mythological interpretations were written by Mohan Sundar and Nandasharma. All singers for the movie were from Orissa and Mohan Sundar maintained traditional music of the land, that is, Odissi music in the cinema. The settings of the songs and dances were carefully chosen. Rishi Biswamitra arrives at the court of King Dasharatha to seek help of Ram and Laxman to combat the Asuras. A group song envelopes the durbar. Both the princes follow Biswamitra to an Ashram where a jagnya is underway. Tadaka and Subahu who then arrive to disrupt have to face the wrath of Ram. Tadaka dies while Subahu flees. A contented Biswamitra then welcomes the brother duo to Rishi Goutam's Ashram. A major welcome song is then played in the cinema: \\"Ei Je Ashrama Dekhuchha Sri Ram, Ei Je Banabaasa\\". After the welcome, another song is sung in praise of Ram, \\"Debanka Tarane, Danuja Marane.\\" Among other songs in the film are \\"Apurba Kumari Tripura Sundari\\" as an ode to Janaki's beauty. Miss Prava in role of Sita, likewise, sings \\"Kali Dekhithili Madhura Chaliki\\", which is jovially joined in by Sita's Sakhis who sing \\"Kahniki Go Priya Sakhi?\\". It was the arrival of the first complete Oriya film. And it was a commercial success too. The two-hour-long movie was released in Lakshmi Theatre, Puri and subsequently at Cinema Palace in Cuttack.

Background  It is not known when Zhang Yi was born, but it is known that his family was from Su Prefecture (ËòáÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu). His family traced its ancestry to officials of the Spring and Autumn period state Jin, the Warring States period state Han, Han Dynasty, Southern Qi, Liang Dynasty, Sui Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty. His great-great-grandfather Zhang Houyin () was a principal of the imperial university early in Tang and carried the title of Duke of Xinye. His grandfather Zhang L√ºshi () served as an advisor to an imperial prince. His grandfather Zhang Yifang () served as a prefectural prefect. His father Zhang Qiqiu ()Zhang Yi's biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang both gave his father's name as Zhang Qiqiu, but the table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang gave it as Zhang Fushang (ÂºµÂ∫ú‰∏ä), although it gave the same office. Presumably, Zhang Yi's father's formal name was Zhang Fushang but went by the courtesy name of Qiqiu. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 125 and New Book of Tang, vol. 152 with New Book of Tang, vol. 72.. was a military governor (Jiedushi) of Shuofang Circuit (ÊúîÊñπ, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia).New Book of Tang, vol. 72.  During Emperors Suzong's and Daizong's reigns  Due to Zhang Yi's father Zhang Qiqiu's status, he was made an officer of the imperial guards early in his career. When the major general Guo Ziyi served as the deputy supreme commander of armed forces in the Guannei Region (ÈóúÂÖß, i.e., the region around the capital Chang'an),Guo served as the deputy supreme commander of the Guannei Region for two separate terms ‚Äî from 757 to 759 and from 763 to 779. As Zhang's biographies implied that his service under Guo was before his demotion, Zhang's service under Guo was likely sometime between 757 and 759. See Old Book of Tang, vols. 120 and 125. because Guo had previously served under Zhang Qiqiu, he invited Zhang Yi to serve as his secretary. He later served as Dali Pingshi (), a judge at the supreme court, and then as Dianzhong Shiyushi (), an imperial censor. During Emperor Suzong's Qianyuan era (758-760), there was an incident when a county magistrate, Lu Cong (), rebuked his subordinate Qi Lingshen (), and Qi, as payback, made false accusations against Lu. Zhang was put in charge of the investigation against Lu, and he suggested that Lu be demoted ‚Äî but after he made his reports to his superiors, they decided that Lu should be executed by caning. Zhang, believing this to be unjust, put on his official uniform and told his mother:Old Book of Tang, vol. 125. Zhang's mother responded: \\"If you are doing the right thing, then I will not worry.\\" Zhang thus submitted a petition in Lu's defense, and Lu was not executed but exiled. Zhang himself was demoted to be the census officer of Fu Prefecture (Êí´Â∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi). He was later made the magistrate of Jinling County (ÊôâÈôµ, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), but before he could report to Jinling, Zhang Gao, the governor of Jiangnan West Circuit (Ê±üÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), invited him to serve as a secretary.Zhang Gao was made the governor of Jiangnan West Circuit in 762 and died in 764, so Zhang Yi's service under Zhang Gao must be sometime during that period. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 111. Zhang Yi later was recalled to Chang'an, and he successively served as Tuntian Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®, Gongbu); Cibu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, L«êbu); and Yousi Yuanwailang (), an assistant to one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). When his mother died, he observed a period of mourning for her, and after the mourning period was over, he was made Sixun Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, L√¨bu, note different tone than the ministry of rites). It was said that he chose his friends carefully and did not associate with many people, and was particularly friendly with Yang Guan and Cui Youfu. In 770, during the reign of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, Zhang Yi was made the prefect of Bo Prefecture (Êø†Â∑û, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui). It was said that he ruled the prefecture effectively, and he invited scholars to teach the students of the prefecture. During his term of service, as a result, over 40 people from the prefecture passed the imperial examinations. He also authored a number of commentaries on the Three Rites (i.e., the Classic of Rites, the Rites of Zhou, and the Yili \\"Etiquette and Rites\\"), the Five Classics, and the Mencius. When the army officer Li Lingyao () rebelled at Biansong Circuit (Ê±¥ÂÆã, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) in 776, Zhang trained the militia and defended the prefecture carefully, drawing Emperor Daizong's praise. He was given the defender of the Huai River region (Ê≤øÊ∑ÆÈéÆÂÆà‰Ωø, Yanhuai Zhenshoushi). He was soon made the prefect of Shou Prefecture (Â£ΩÂ∑û, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), and continued to carry the title of defender of the Huai River Region.  During Emperor Dezong's reign  Emperor Daizong died in 779 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong. He made Zhang Yi the governor of Jiangnan West Circuit and the prefect of its capital Hong Prefecture (). Later, he recalled Zhang to serve as the deputy minister of civil services affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). He later made Zhang the governor of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), but after just a few days made Zhang the military governor of Yongping Circuit (Ê∞∏Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Kaifeng) instead. Claiming an illness, Zhang never reported to Yongping Circuit. He was allowed to return to Chang'an to recover from illness at his mansion.During this relevant period, Li Mian served as the military governor of Yongping Circuit. It therefore appeared that the language from Zhang's biography, which suggested a feigned illness rather than a real one, was effectively to decline replacing Li Mian. See Old Book of Tang, vols. 11, 12, 131. In 780, when the chancellor Yang Yan was removed from his post, Emperor Dezong made Zhang Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), and gave him the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. Zhang Yi's chancellor colleague Lu Qi, however, was trusted by Emperor Dezong and was far more powerful than Zhang himself was. For example, later in the year, when Li Wei () the prefect of Xu Prefecture (ÂæêÂ∑û, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), was ready to submit to imperial authority and turn against his relative, Li Na, who was resisting imperial authority and ruling Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) independently after Emperor Dezong denied him permission to succeed his father Li Zhengji. Li Wei sent his assistant Cui Cheng () to Chang'an to report on Li Wei's submission and suggested that if Emperor Dezong publicly made him the governor of, in addition to Xu, two other prefectures nearby, that those prefectures would also follow his call to return to imperial authority. When Cui arrived at Chang'an, however, not understanding the power balance between the chancellors, he reported to Zhang rather than Lu. Even though Zhang relayed the report to Lu, Lu was still angered, and Li Wei's proposal was rejected. Subsequently, the imperial government was only able to recover Xu Prefecture. In 782, Zhao Zong (), the minister of husbandry and a son-in-law to Guo Ziyi (who had died in 781), was accused by his own eunuch Dangqian () of improprieties. Zhao was arrested and detained at the bureau of censors, while Emperor Dezong kept Dangqian as an imperial servant at the bureau of eunuchs. Zhang submitted a lengthy petition, pointing out that it was troubling that Zhang was being arrested based on accusation of a servant and that he was the third son-in-law of Guo's to be accused of crimes within a short period after Guo's death. As a result, Emperor Dezong only demoted Zhao and put Dangqian to death for betraying his master. Zhang took Dangqian's body and displayed it to all of the servants of the Guo household as a warning. Zhang was respected by Emperor Dezong, and Lu became jealous of this, and he wanted to remove Zhang from his chancellor position. Later in 782, when Emperor Dezong removed Zhu Ci the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) from his post because Zhu Ci's brother Zhu Tao the acting military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), had rebelled against imperial authority, Lu stated that due to Fengxiang's importance, Zhu Ci needed to be succeeded by a chancellor, and offered to take the position himself. When Emperor Dezong hesitated, Lu, who was ugly in appearance, immediately stated that he understood Emperor Dezong's hesitation that because of his ugliness he might not be able to gain the respect of the army, and requested that someone else be sent. Emperor Dezong thus made Zhang the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit and the mayor of Fengxiang Municipality, and Zhang continued to carry a chancellor designation as an honorary designation. In 783, by Emperor Dezong's orders, Zhang and the Tufan chancellor Nanam Shang Gyaltsen Lhanang (\\"Shang Jiezan\\" () in Chinese) swore an oath of friendship between the two states.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. In the solemn ceremony, Zhang and six of his staff members ‚Äî among whom were future chancellors Qi Ying, Qi Kang, and Yu Di ‚Äî served as administrators of the oath on the Tang side, while Shang and six of key Tufan officials and generals served as administrators of the oath on the Tufan side. Zhang was, however, ashamed of having to swear an oath with someone that he saw as a barbarian, and he wanted to reduce the solemnity of the oath. Originally, the oath was to be accompanied by sacrifices of horses and cattle. Zhang requested that sheep, pigs, and dogs be substituted, but as pigs could not be found in the locale, at Shang's suggestion, goats were substituted instead. It was said that while Zhang was serving as the military governor of Fengxiang, he was not well- acquainted with military matters, and spent much time on personal appearance. On November 2, 783, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (Ê∂áÂéü, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), at Chang'an to await deployment to the east against warlords, mutinied when they did not receive rewards they felt they deserved. Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian (Â•âÂ§©, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), but as Fengtian was a small city, considered further heading to Fengxiang. The soldiers supported Zhu Ci as their leader, and Zhu Ci initially postured that he would calm the people of Chang'an and then welcome Emperor Dezong back to Chang'an. Meanwhile, Zhang, hearing of the mutiny and of Emperor Dezong's considering visiting Fengxiang, began undertaking preparations for the emperor's arrival. Qi Ying and Qi Kang pointed out that one of the military officers, Li Chulin (), was previously a subordinate of Zhu Ci's and would be difficult to control. Zhang thus issued an order that Li Chulin report to Long Prefecture (Èö¥Â∑û, in modern Baoji). Li Chulin, giving excuses, did not report immediately, and Zhang, concentrating on welcoming the emperor, never followed up on whether Li Chulin left for Long Prefecture. The night of November 8, Li Chulin and his associates mutinied and attacked Zhang's headquarters. Zhang and two of his sons climbed over the city walls and tried to flee, but were captured by the mutineers and killed. He was posthumously honored by Emperor Dezong.

Missionary work in India The Maha Bodhi Society invited Saddhatissa to become a missionary (dharmaduta) monk in India like his contemporary Henepola Gunaratana. In order to teach to Indians he learnt Indian languages such as Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi. While in India, he came to know B. R. Ambedkar, who reportedly obtained advice from him on how to draft the Indian constitution along the lines of the vinaya.The Sri Lankan Sunday Observer He also obtained an M.A. Degree from the Banaras Hindu University and then became a lecturer there.

He thus developed his thought, specifically in Buddhist ethics, with both traditional training and Western thought in mind. His primary Western influence (in Buddhist Ethics at least) appears to be Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, followed by the French philologist Louis de La Vall√©e-Poussin.Buddhist Ethics see notes His main interest was in staying close to the 'lived expression' of Buddhism as opposed to abstract academic theorizing.

He primarily played third base and catcher during his career, but was a utility man who played four different positions during his Major League Career. He served as batting coach for two seasons with the Rochester Red Wings of the International League until his firing on September 9, 2011. He was known as \\"Sugar Bear\\" and a fan favorite for his roly-poly physique. Early career Rayford's professional baseball career began in 1975, when he was drafted as a catcher out of Manual Arts High School in the fourth round of the amateur draft by the California Angels. He spent the 1975 through 1979 seasons in the Angels' minor league system, spending the 1979 season at the Triple-A level playing for the Salt Lake City Gulls. In his first Triple-A season, he batted .294 with 13 home runs while playing third base. Baltimore Orioles (first stint) After playing one season for the Gulls, Rayford was traded, along with an undisclosed amount of money, from the Angels organization to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for Larry Harlow. In 1980, Rayford made his major league debut for the Orioles; over the course of the season he played in 8 games for the Orioles while spending most of the year with the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings. He spent the entire 1981 season with the Red Wings, during which he played on the losing side of the longest game in baseball history and caught the 31st inning of that game. In 1982, he returned to the Major League with the Orioles, but he hit only .132 in 34 games. When Cal Ripken, Jr. began his streak of 2,632 consecutive games played in 1982, Rayford was the player who Ripken replaced in the lineup. Rayford had been given a day off in the second game of a doubleheader and Ripken started at third base in his place. He again returned to Rochester in 1983, and hit .371 in 42 games with the Red Wings. St. Louis Cardinals During the 1983 season, the Orioles traded Rayford to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for a player to be named later, which became outfielder Tito Landrum. He was the backup third baseman behind Ken Oberkfell that year and hit .212 in 56 games for the Cardinals. Baltimore Orioles (second stint) Less than a year after trading Rayford, the Orioles purchased his contract from the Cardinals before the 1984 season. He served primarily as a backup catcher in his first year back with the Orioles, and his hitting numbers improved, with his average reaching .256 in 1984. Sharing time as the regular third baseman in 1985, Rayford had a career year, hitting .306 with 18 home runs and 48 runs batted in, all career highs. His numbers fell in 1986 when he batted .176 and was sent back to Rochester. He split the 1987 season between Baltimore and Rochester and batted .220 at the Major League level in what would prove to be his final major league season. Minor league career Before retiring as a player, Rayford played parts of three seasons, from 1989 to 1991, with the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, playing in 81 games with the club over the three-year span. During the latter two seasons, Rayford served as a player-coach, starting a long tenure as a minor league coach. Since 1990, he has coached eight separate minor league teams, and in 1996, he spent his only season to date as a minor league manager, doing so for the Batavia Clippers. He has been a member of the Rock Cats' coaching staff since 2005.

The area surrounding these islets is a good diving spot owing to its relative remoteness. Territorial dispute The Ko Kra group, although barren and uninhabited, is part of a territorial dispute along with the islet of Ko Losin. The dispute over the continental shelf boundary between Malaysia and Thailand arises from the different baselines which the two countries adopt in calculating the equidistant line for boundary. Thailand's proclaimed baseline runs from the terminus at Kuala Tabar (the eastern terminus of the Malaysia- Thailand land border as defined by the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909) northwards to Ko Losin islet and then northwestwards to Ko Kra. Malaysia however does not regard Ko Losin as a valid baseline point and calculates the equidistant line on a baseline running along the shore.

There he published a historical paper and another one on building connections between the sciences and humanities in gymnasium studies. In 1823, he went to work in Berlin at a military academy as a history teacher. There he also became involved with the issuance of new editions of Karl Friedrich Becker's \\"Weltgeschichte\\" (World history). He eventually oversaw the issuance of three new editions. During this time period he was friends to Henrich Steffens (1773-1845) and Friedrich von Raumer (1781-1873).

Formed in 1979, the band included future Swans singer Michael Gira on vocals, guitarist Rick Oller, bassist Dan Braun, Josh Braun on keyboards and Angelo Pudignano on drums. Jonathan Kane, also of Swans, would become the third drummer for the group. The group recorded only one EP, a self-titled effort on Labor Records, before disbanding in 1981. History The first members of Circus Mort included Don Christensen on bass guitar. Before adopting the name Circus Mort the band was called Metal Envelope. Twin brothers Josh and Dan Braun joined in September 1979 on the recommendation of Christensen, followed by Pudignano who answered an advertisement in the Village Voice. The band recorded two songs at Sorcerer Sound Studios in late 1979, \\"Require Require\\" and \\"Working for Pleasure\\", which led to the interest of promoter Jim Fouratt. He hired the band to play at the rock disco Hurrah in February 1980, opening for Snatch. Pudignano left the band, and was replaced by Mike Pedulla. The band gigged around New York throughout 1980 playing at various clubs. In late 1980, Pedulla announced that he was leaving the band, and Jonathan Kane took his place. Shortly after, the band landed a recording contract with the newly formed Labor Records. The band recorded demos of two songs, \\"Children Remember\\" and \\"Yellow Light\\" at Sorcerer Sound to prepare for a forthcoming EP. Producer Peter Ivers oversaw the recording of further tracks at Minot Sound in White Plains, New York. Their first concert after the recording was supporting Bauhaus in early 1981. The band's final performance was in Boston, with The Neats, before disbanding thereafter. Gira with Kane later went on to form Swans. Dan Braun also joined Swans for a short period, and recorded live with them at CBGB, which was released as Body to Body, Job to Job. Kane went on to play with Rhys Chatham and La Monte Young.

History The Port Kembla District Rugby League Football Club first entered the local rugby league competition in 1914, fielding a Third Grade team. The club wore an all- dark green jersey, playing on a home ground which was a section of the old golf links (the original Port Kembla Golf Club), located near Hill 60. The club played only one year before the First World War interrupted the competition. In 1919, at the completion of World War I, the PKDRLFC resumed playing in the local 3rd Grade competition, this time playing in all-black jerseys (and becoming known as \\"The Blacks\\"). The Club entered 3rd Grade in 1919, Reserve Grade in 1920, and then First Grade in 1921. The club did not have to wait long to win their maiden First Grade title and start a history of strong and respected local rugby league teams. 1922, the year of this first victory, also became the first of three consecutive First Grade titles for \\"The Blacks\\". The Club won five First Grade titles before adding a single white vee to their playing strip. The first top grade premiership in this jersey was won in 1934. It was not until the mid-1950s that the second white vee was added to the jersey to form the now famous Port Kembla \\"traditional\\" jersey. A few alternate strips were trialled in later years including a predominantly white jersey with horizontal black stripes in the mid-1980s, and the more modern sublimated strip from 1994. In 1999, the Club reverted to a more traditional playing strip, while still using the sublimated print jersey. The essence of the black jersey with two white vees was clearly evident, and still is today. 1946 saw the Port Kembla District RLFC win the Clayton Cup, presented to the Country Rugby League First Grade club with the best season record. The First Grade team in 1946 went through the season undefeated ‚Äì a feat also achieved in 1928 and 1941. No other Illawarra rugby league club has achieved this feat since. The PKDRLFC enjoyed all three grades winning their respective premierships on three occasions ‚Äì 1937, 1938 and 1958. Port Kembla also holds the record for the most first grade titles won in all Australian rugby league competitions, including the NRL ‚Äì 22 in total. The Port Kembla Rugby League Football Club are credited with establishing the Port Kembla Leagues Club in the early 1950s, the club's major sponsor for most of its existence. Notable players Port Kembla has produced five Australian representatives in Noel Mulligan, Frank Johnston, Charlie Hazleton, Ian Moir and John Simon. Another Three Port Kembla players have reached state representative honours ‚Äì Terry Beckett, Terry Johnston and Chris Walsh ‚Äì while Chris Walsh and John Cross have also captained the Illawarra Steelers. Other notable juniors include; Kane Linnett, Keith Lulia. A host of Port Kembla coaches have also made State and Australian teams including Ron Costello, Graeme Langlands and Brian Hetherington. Modern era The Black's last senior premiership was achieved in 2010 when the team coached by Jason Sullivan and captained by Jon Koot defeated Mount Kembla in the VBR Cup Grand Final 22‚Äì10. The last First Grade Grand Final appearance was in 1980 when Port were defeated by Western Suburbs in a dour and windy tryless Grand Final to the score of 6‚Äì2. Port Kembla won their most recent Under 18 titles in 2004 and again in 2006. The club also won their 13th Club Championship Trophy in 2004. In 2007, Keith Lulia became the first Port Kembla junior since John Simon to progress to the NRL, debuting with the St George Illawarra Dragons in a 22‚Äì20 win over newcomers, the Gold Coast Titans. 2007 Under 18's centre, Kane Linnett, joined the Dragons top squad in 2008 before playing a leading role in helping the Sydney Roosters to the 2010 Grand Final. Linnett is currently contracted to the North Queensland Cowboys. In 2008 Port Kembla had to pull out of first and reserve grade due to financial constraints and player availability. The club instead participated in the VB Cup competition (third grade), winning the minor premiership, before backing it up in 2010, taking it all the way to win the VBR Cup premiership. The club re-entered First Grade in 2013, moving to the South Coast Group 7 competition, but withdrew at the end of the 2017 season when they could not fulfil the terms of their current on- loan arrangement from the Illawarra District Rugby League competition to Group Seven ‚Äì where they were required to field a first and reserve grade side, as well as an under 18's side where possible.

Based on the novel by Kalindi Charan Panigrahi of the same name, the film contrasts traditional and modern values as exemplified by the different attitudes of two brothers towards their inherited family land. The plot explores human relationships using a wide range of themes, including Gandhian and Marxist ideologies, postwar social conditions, agrarian culture, rustic life, and traditional family values.http://mrinalsen.org/matira_manisha.htm  Synopsis  The plot revolves round the family of Shama Pradhan, a rural farmer, and his two sons, Baraju (played by Sarat Pujari) and Chakadi (played by Prashanta Nanda), and disagreements over the family home and land after his death. On his death, Shama Pradhan entrusts his elder son Baraju with the responsibility of looking after his younger son Chakadi, and entreats him to keep the family land and home together, and not split it between the two brothers. Baraju is a peace-loving person who commands respect from the villagers for his idealistic way of life, and Baraju's wife Harabou (played by Bhanumati Devi) is portrayed as an ideal housewife, who is very caring and affectionate towards Chakadi, his wife Netramani (played by Sujata Anand) and their two children. Chakadi, in contrast, is shown as carefree and irresponsible, happy to loaf around the village. His wife, Netramani, who is envious of Harabou, insists that the property should be split between the two brothers. A local troublemaker, Hari Mishra (played by Dukhiram Swain), also tries to sow discord between the two brothers. Swayed by the designs of his wife Netramani, and of troublemaker Hari Mishra, Chakadi asks his elder brother to divide the property between them. Baraju is shocked, and is torn between his respect for his father's wishes and his affection for his brother. His solution is to hand over the land and the house to Chakadi, satisfying Chakadi's desire, while respecting his promise to his father not to partition the property. Baraju leaves the house with his wife Harabou and their two children, without regret or rancour. After Baraju's departure, Chakadi feels miserable, is nostalgic about the old times, and wants his brother and family back. He goes to Baraju and begs him to return home. But Baraju, who is committed to the spirit of sacrifice, non-attachment, and love, advises Chakadi to go back home and take care of all that he has left behind.

The park is one part of several local conservation areas, as it borders the Pakuratahi Forest and the Tararua Range. The park includes the Remutaka Rail Trail, dis- established rail line that operated from 1878-1955 that is now used for mountain biking and walking. In 2017, the name of the park (and range) was changed from \\"Rimutaka\\" to \\"Remutaka\\" following a treaty settlement with RangitƒÅne o Wairarapa and RangitƒÅne o Tamaki nui-ƒÅ-Rua. (The former name continues to be used in some online documents.)  Rare and protected species  Orongorongo River within the Orongorongo valley The Orongorongo Valley is one of two known areas that host the endangered fungus boletopsis nothofagi. A population of North Island brown kiwi has been established in the northern part of the Remutaka Forest Park, called the Turere catchment kiwi zone. To support the population's growth, kiwi eggs are transferred by volunteers to the Pukaha Mount Bruce Wildlife Centre and other protected areas such as the Wairakei Sanctuary for incubation and early growth. The programme is working. In 2014, an analysis of acoustic recordings indicated that more than 100 birds were living in the park. This is a 10-fold increase from the 10 kiwi that were originally released. The kiwi zone is protected by a dog exclusion area. Dogs may run off lead within a defined exercise area in Catchpool Valley, but restrictions apply in the rest of the park. Recreation The park is a popular recreation area for the surrounding Wellington and Wairarapa regions. In the north, the Remutaka Rail Trail is used extensively by walkers and mountain bikers. The rail trail is generally accessed by road north of Upper Hutt, as the gradient to the summit is gentler on that side. The Rimutaka Incline is on the eastern side of the summit and can also be accessed by road, south of Featherston at Cross Creek. The back country hills attract hunting and multi-day hiking expeditions. The Orongorongo Valley is home to a number of private huts. At the Catchpool entrance, south of Lower Hutt, there are two camping areas as well as outdoor BBQs and flushing toilets.  Proposed de- extinction of moa  The park was the subject of a minor political argument surrounding a proposal to revive the extinct moa. Local politician Trevor Mallard, called for support for a de-extinction attempt \\"50-100 years out\\".

The story focuses on Yonkuro Hinomaru, a delinquent Mini-4WD enthusiast and member of a Mini 4WD racing team who tackles the world of miniature car racing. It is created as a tie-in to Tamiya's Mini 4WD franchise, and it is the first series to center on the franchise. An anime series based on the original manga was produced by Staff 21, Aubekku & Tokyu Agency and aired on TV Tokyo from October 3, 1989 to March 27, 1990. A sequel manga series, titled Hyper Dash! Yonkuro was created and illustrated by Hiroyuki Takei and began serialization on CoroCoro Aniki on March 14, 2015. Plot The story is a succession of races in fancy routes (pyramids, labyrinths, etc.) and tracks fit to make the cars race. During the series run, many characters will appear, like Momotaro (and his Mini 4WD, Crimson Glory, DashWarriors'last obstacle towards the final victory), Sabu Kinjiro (Aero Solitude) and also Jin that will race the Hell Rally with a new Mini4wd, the Proto Emperor ZX (the previous one was the Dash-X1 Proto Emperor, defeated in the regional finals by Yonkuro's then new mini4wd, the Dash-01 Super Emperor). The tracks become always more harder and the stories unlikely (in a volume of the manga, is mentioned that even the prehistoric children used mini4wd-like cars built with natural materials like wood and leaves that would be pushed by the wind), the story always will focus even more on which one would be the true \\"Emperor\\", it will be discovered are many mini4wds with this title that will confront against Yonkuro's Emperor, until the epilogue, in the epic challenge of the Hell Rally. in this race Yonkuro will challenge a group of delinquents that want to take advantage of the best mini4wd racers to manage recovering a treasure hidden during the World War II by the nazis. Between his opponents there will be a revived Ken Hinomaru, ready to challenge the son and test his abilities with his new mini 4wd, the Dash-0 Infinite Boundless. In the end, Yonkuro, helped by his teammates (now far from racing, but always bound by a deep friendship), triumphs with his new car, the Liberty Emperor. Media =Manga= The manga was written and illustrated by Zaurus Tokuda, serialized in the monthly CoroCoro Comic from December 1987 until March 1992, compiling it into 14 Tankobon volumes.

This protection is also extended to the holder of a place kick. It is a separate penalty from \\"running into the kicker.\\" In the NFL, a defensive player commits a \\"roughing the kicker\\" foul if he (a) contacts the plant leg of the kicker while his kicking leg is still in the air; or (b) slides into or contacts the kicker when both of the kicker‚Äôs feet are on the ground. It is not a foul if the contact is not severe, or if the kicker returns both feet to the ground prior to the contact and falls over a defender who is on the ground. NFL Rule book, Article 9, Rule 12, Section 2 The penalty for such a violation in most leagues is 15 yards and an automatic first down. When such a violation occurs, the team about to surrender possession via a punt will retain its possession as a result. If the violation occurs when a successful field goal is kicked, the yardage is assessed on the ensuing kickoff, unless the offended team elects to accept the penalty and continue its drive in hopes of scoring a touchdown, which is referred to \\"taking the points off the board\\". Such protections are also extended to the holder during field goal kicks; the penalty for roughing the holder is identical. History In 1914, the term \\"roughing the kicker\\" came into use. Previously, it was known as \\"running into the fullback after the kick.\\" In 1917, penalties for roughing the kicker were measured from the spot where the ball was put out of play. The penalty inspired the name of hip-hop-trio, Ruffin da kickah, a Boston based group composed of Boston College Law Students. References Category:Gridiron football penalties ","title":"Roughing the kicker"},{"id":"19996984","text":"In gridiron football, roughing the passer is a foul in which a defensive player makes illegal contact with an offensive player (most often the quarterback) after the latter has thrown a forward pass. The penalty is 10 or 15 yards, depending on the league, and an automatic first down for the offense. Defenders are allowed to contact a player attempting a forward pass while he still has possession of the ball (e.g., a quarterback sack); however, once the ball is released, defenders are not allowed to make contact with the quarterback unless carried to do so by momentum. Judgment over whether contact following release was the result of a violation or momentum is made by the referee on a case-by-case basis. Roughing the passer can also be called if the defender commits intimidating acts toward the passer, such as picking him up and stuffing him into the ground, or wrestling with him. It can also be called if the player who tackles the passer makes helmet to helmet contact, or lands with the full weight of his body on the passer. An exception to the roughing rule is where the passer rejoins a play after throwing the ball, such as in an attempt to block, recover a fumble, or tackle a defensive player who has gained possession of the ball. In this case, the passer is treated as any other player and may legally be contacted. Roughing the passer also does not apply to lateral passes or backward passes. Justification The NFL makes roughing the passer against the rules in an effort to protect its quarterbacks.

The Yuma County Area Transit (YCAT) system is a public transportation system based in Yuma County, Arizona. Since 1990 the agency has grown from a new transit service offering paratransit to the current mix of fixed-route and demand- responsive services serving over 32,000 riders per month, with an annual operating budget of $2.5 million. YCAT is also the local Greyhound Lines agent. Before 1999 only private transportation companies operated any type of transit service in Yuma County, with taxis serving the urbanized areas and private van services providing transportation between San Luis and Yuma. Paratransit in Yuma County began in February 1999. When the Saguaro Foundation began operating a public dial-a-ride system funded by Yuma Metropolitan Planning Organization (YMPO) in 1996, YMPO's fixed-route service began in February 1999 with service between San Luis and Yuma under the name Valley Transit. The name YCAT or Yuma County Area Transit was adopted in 2002, with a new system of two routes, a local route within Yuma and an intercity route between San Luis and Yuma/Arizona Western College. YCAT service between Yuma and Foothills was initiated in 2001, but the ridership was not considered high enough to justify the cost, and the system was shortened to terminate at Arizona Western College. After a comprehensive review of the transit system by Moore and Associates, as well as financial and operating difficulties in 2003 which nearly caused the fixed-route transit system to shut down, the city of Yuma and other member jurisdictions in Yuma County contributed additional funding to the system. YMPO selected a new operating contractor, and service survived. Two routes were added to the system in 2004, and an additional route to Wellton was initiated in January 2006. Service was expanded to 10:00 pm on all routes in the system on a network of seven routes. In 2010, again after financial and operating difficulties, reductions in funding from the State of Arizona and local member entities, which resulted in the elimination of two routes within the City of Yuma, reduction of service hours from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm, Monday through Saturday. YCAT came very close to closing down. However, a new operations strategy adopted by YMPO came into play to save the transit system using a reduced level of local funding from its member entities with the exception of the City of Yuma. In December 2010, a new agency - Yuma County Intergovernmental Public Transportation Authority (YCIPTA) was formed to assume the operation of transit services from YMPO, which was completed on July 1, 2012. A new service delivery model was implemented on January 9, 2012, with a complete restructure of all routes to improve efficiency. Today, a total of 9 routes now operate Monday through Saturday on a fleet of 17 YCAT fixed route buses and 11 cutaways and vans. Both demand-response and fixed- route service is administered and funded by the YCIPTA and its member agencies, and operated by a private contractor. Presently, YCIPTA owns all vehicles for fixed-route and demand-response service as well as the lease for the East 14th Street and Atlantic Avenue maintenance facility.  What is YCIPTA  = Yuma County Intergovernmental Public Transportation Authority (YCIPTA) = Under Arizona Revised Statutes - Title 28 Transportation, an intergovernmental public transportation authority (IPTA) may be organized in any county in Arizona with a population of two hundred thousand persons or less. Besides the YCIPTA, the Coconino and Yavapai Counties; the city of Flagstaff, and Northern Arizona University formed the Northern Arizona Intergovernmental Public Transportation Authority (NAIPTA) to assume public transit services from the city of Flagstaff, and Coconino County in an attempt to unify and coordinate public transit services in this region. The YCIPTA is an IPTA that was formed on December 13, 2010 by the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to administer, plan, operate and maintain public transit services throughout Yuma County, including within the political jurisdictional boundaries of the Cities of Yuma, San Luis, Somerton, Town on Wellton and the unincorporated Yuma County areas. Dial-A-Ride logoOn September 21, 2010, the Town of Wellton and City of Somerton passed a resolution to petition the County to form the IPTA. On October 3 and 20, 2010 respectively, the Cities of San Luis and Yuma passed a resolution to petition the County to form the IPTA. On December 6, 2010, Northern Arizona University petitioned the County to join the IPTA. On December 13, 2010, the County held a public hearing and approved the formation of the IPTA. On January 24, 2011, the Yuma County Intergovernmental Public Transportation Authority (YCIPTA) held its first Board of Directors meeting. Since the first meeting, Arizona Western College, Quechan Indian Tribe, and Cocopah Indian Tribe has petition and joined the IPTA. Support from the YMPO Executive Board was provided in August 2010 through the formation of a subcommittee to establish new governance structure for public transit management and again in August 2011 through the adoption of a resolution with an intent to transfer transit operations to YCIPTA by July 1, 2012. The transition was completed on July 1, 2012. In 2014, National Express replaced First Transit as the operator.National Express to Operate Yuma County Area Transit Service in August It is the intent that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding that is used to support Yuma County Area Transit (YCAT) and Greater Yuma Area Dial-A-Ride (DAR) would be used by YCIPTA through YCIPTA designation as a grantee. YCIPTA would receive local match funding from the governmental entities, Indian tribes plus Northern Arizona University and Arizona Western College. Yuma County Area Transit (YCAT) is the marketing name for the YCIPTA and the fixed route transit system. YCAT OnCall is the marketing name for the demand responsive transit system, previously known as Greater Yuma Area Dial-A-Ride. YCAT began in 2003 as a rebranded effort from what was previously known as Valley Transit. Greater Yuma Area Dial-A-Ride began in 1996 and was the county‚Äôs first public transportation service. The Yuma Metropolitan Planning Organization (YMPO) has been the administrator of public transit service in Yuma County since 1999 utilizing Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding that has been available to the Yuma Urbanized Area since 1980 when the urbanized area exceeds 50,000 in population. YCIPTA has since taken over. YCIPTA is managed by a Transit Director with support staff. YCIPTA has agreements in place with Yuma County for human resources, financial services, Treasurer, Clerk of the Board, and Information Technology support. YCIPTA had a management agreement in place with YMPO to manage the day-to-day operations of the transit system until June 30, 2012. There are nine Board Members that consist of City Administrators, Town Manager, Tribal Planning Directors, College Presidents and County Administrator from the member entities that set the overall policy for the transit system. Each member entity receives one vote on the Board of Directors. When financial contributions are discussed, the Board of Directors has opted towards a weighted voting structure to ensure that members that pay more into the system have fair representation. The Board of Directors meets on the 4th Monday of each month at 1:30 pm at Yuma County Development Services Building inside Aldrich Hall. YCAT operates nine fixed routes and a demand responsive service throughout the southwestern quadrant of Yuma County and portions of Imperial County. YCAT operates Monday-Friday from 5:50 am to approximately 7:30 pm, with limited service continuing until 11:00 pm. On Saturday, service operates from 9:15 am to 6:30 pm with headways every 60 minutes. There is no service on Sundays or major holidays at this time. These services are provided under a contractual arrangement with First Transit of Cincinnati, Ohio. First Transit is part of First Group, a United Kingdom-based corporation that also consists of Greyhound, First Student and First Group operations in the United Kingdom. YCAT operates 28 buses. 17 buses are powered by diesel and used on YCAT fixed routes. 8 buses and 3 vans are powered by gasoline and used on YCAT OnCall. All buses and vans are owned by YCIPTA and were purchased with Federal Transit Administration funding.

It is said that his parents died when he was around twenty and undertook to provide for his aunt and uncle, brother and sister, and his wife, whom he married at a very young age.Kerr, George H. Okinawa: The History of an Island People. Tokyo: Tuttle Publishing, 2000. pp102-104. In one year in which the island had suffered from a particularly severe drought, the rice paddies of Kanamaru's family were found to be full of water; accused of having stolen the water, Kanamaru was forced to flee his home, and ended up in Ginama, in the northern region (Kunigami) of Okinawa Island. After several years living in Ginama, there too some type of dispute or disagreement between Kanamaru and his neighbors emerged. Leaving Ginama, he traveled to Shuri, the capital of the Ryukyu Kingdom, in 1441, and became a servant or retainer to the prince, Sh≈ç Taiky≈´. After Sh≈ç Taiky≈´ became king in 1454, Kanamaru was made royal treasurer, and was in 1459 granted the post of , a position involving responsibility for matters regarding foreign relations and trade. He was also granted territory, and made . There emerged a difference of opinion between Kanamaru, and Sh≈ç Toku, who succeeded Sh≈ç Taiky≈´ as king in 1461, possibly over the king's costly military efforts on the island of Kikai, leading Kanamaru to leave Shuri and retire to Uchima. Sh≈ç Toku died shortly afterwards, however, and it is said that in the ensuing discussions among the elder bureaucrats to choose a successor, Kanamaru was selected by popular demand, and thus came to the throne, taking the royal name Sh≈ç En. Historian George H. Kerr, however, points out that official histories produced in the following centuries were written with the patronage of Sh≈ç En's successors; also that the circumstances surrounding Sh≈ç Toku's death remain something of a mystery, and the traditional account may simply indicate that there was a shift in allegiances among the aristocrats and bureaucrats towards Kanamaru, or that those parties in support of Kanamaru simply outnumbered those on the side of the late king. Reign Shimazu samurai clan, 1471. Sh≈ç En thus established the Second Sh≈ç Dynasty, taking on the honorary surname granted the kings of Ryukyu by the Ming Dynasty (and later, Qing Dynasty) of China. He also banned members of the former Sh≈ç lineage from high government office, and from marrying into the lineage of the new dynasty, and took steps to elevate the prestige of his own family. His father came to be honored as King of Izena, and a formal tomb was constructed for Sh≈ç En's parents on Izena Island. Sh≈ç En also named his sister high priestess, or \\"noro\\", of Izena; the lineage of high priestesses descended from her continued until the 20th century. His reign marked the beginning of an institutional shift in the royal government, away from rule by a charismatic or otherwise gifted individual leader, i.e. the king, and towards a more bureaucratic system, with the king at its center. Sh≈ç En's childhood wife is believed to have died, or otherwise separated from Kanamaru, before he rose to prominence at Shuri. He had his first son with his second wife, Yosoidon. Sh≈ç En died in 1476, after ruling for only a few years, and was succeeded by his brother Sh≈ç Sen'i, to Yosoidon's chagrin. Presently, the high priestess, daughter of the late king and Yosoidon, received a divine message indicating that Sh≈ç Sen'i should abdicate in favor of his nephew, son of Sh≈ç En, who then took the throne as Sh≈ç Shin.

She was popularly known as the Jhansi Rani of Travancore.  Early life and education  She was born on 14 February 1909 in a Nasrani family (Karippaparambil) at Kanjirapally, Travancore, as the second daughter of Thomman Cherian and Annamma Karippaparambil. She was educated at Government Girls High School, Kanjirapally and St. Joseph's High School, Changanacherry. She earned a BA in History from St. Teresa's College, Ernakulam. After completing her education in 1931, she worked as a teacher at St. Mary's English Medium School, edakkara), where she later became head mistress. She worked in this institution for about six years, and during this period she also did her L. T. degree from Tri Training College. Accamma Cheriyan (Malayalam) by R.Parvathi Devi,  Freedom fighter  In February 1938, the Travancore State Congress was formed and Accamma gave up her teaching career to join the struggle for liberty. =Agitation for a responsible government= Civil disobedience movement Under the State Congress, the people of Travancore started an agitation for a responsible government. C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, the Dewan of Travancore, decided to suppress the agitation. On 26 August 1938, he banned the State Congress which then organised a civil disobedience movement. Prominent State Congress leaders including its President Pattom A. Thanu Pillai were arrested and put behind bars. The State Congress then decided to change its method of agitation. Its working committee was dissolved and the president was given dictatorial powers and the right to nominate his successor. Eleven 'dictators' (Presidents) of the State Congress were arrested one by one. Kuttanad Ramakrishna Pillai, the eleventh dictator, before his arrest nominated Accamma Cherian as the twelfth dictator. Rally to the Kowdiar Palace Accamma Cherian led a mass rally from Thampanoor to the Kowdiar Palace of the Maharaja Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma to revoke a ban on State Congress. The agitating mob also demanded the dismissal of the Dewan, C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, against whom the State Congress leaders had levelled several charges. The British police chief ordered his men to fire on the rally of over 20,000 people . Accamma Cherian cried, \\"I am the leader; shoot me first before you kill others\\". Her courageous words forced the police authorities to withdraw their orders. On hearing the news M. K. Gandhi hailed her as 'The Jhansi Rani of Travancore'. She was arrested and convicted for violating prohibitory orders in 1939. =Formation of Desasevika Sangh= In October 1938, the working committee of the State Congress directed Accamma Cherian to organise the Desasevika Sangh (Female Volunteer Group). She toured various centres and appealed to the women to join as members of the Desasevika Sangh. =Imprisonments= Accamma Had been imprisoned twice during her struggle for independence. The Annual conference of the State Congress The first annual conference of the State Congress was held at Vattiyoorkavu on 22 and 23 December 1938 in spite of the ban orders. Almost all leaders of the State Congress were arrested and imprisoned. Accamma, along with her sister Rosamma Punnose (also a freedom fighter, M.L.A., and a CPI leader from 1948), was arrested and jailed on 24 December 1939. They were sentenced to a year's imprisonment. They were insulted and threatened in the jail. Due to the instruction given by the jail authorities, some prisoners used abusing and vulgar words against them. This matter was brought to the notice of M.K. Gandhi by Pattom A. Thanu Pillai. C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, however, denied it. Accamma's brother, K. C. Varkey Karippaparambil, also took part in freedom movement. Quit India Movement Accamma, after her release from jail, became a full-time worker of the State Congress. In 1942, she became its Acting President. In her presidential address, she welcomed the Quit India Resolution passed at the historic Bombay session of the Indian National Congress on 8 August 1942. She was arrested and awarded one year imprisonment. In 1946, she was arrested and imprisoned for six months for violating ban orders. In 1947, she was again arrested as she raised her voice against C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar's desire for an independent Travancore. Statue of Accamma Cherian in Vellayambalam, Thiruvananthapuram  Life in Independent India  In 1947, after independence, Accamma was elected unopposed to the Travancore Legislative Assembly from Kanjirapally. In 1951, she married V.V. Varkey Mannamplackal, a freedom fighter and a member of Travancore Cochin Legislative Assembly. They had one son, George V. Varkey, an engineer. In the early 1950s, she resigned from the Congress Party after being denied a Lok Sabha ticket and in 1952, she unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary election from Muvattupuzha constituency as an independent. In the early 1950s, when the parties ideologies were changing, she quit politics. Her husband V. V. Varkey Mannamplackal, Chirakkadavu. served as an MLA in the Kerala Legislative Assembly from 1952‚Äì54. In 1967, she contested the Assembly election from Kanjirapally as a Congress candidate but was defeated by the Communist Party's candidate. Later, she served as a member of the Freedom Fighters' Pension Advisory Board.  Death and commemoration  Accamma Cherian Park Accamma Cherian died on 5 May 1982. A statue was erected in her memory in Vellayambalam, Thiruvananthapuram. A documentary film was made on her life by Sreebala K. Menon.

There is a small but significant Xhosa-speaking (Mfengu) community in Zimbabwe, and their language, isiXhosa, is recognised as a national language.Nombembe, Caciswa. \\"Music-making of the Xhosa diasporic community: a focus on the Umguyo tradition in Zimbabwe.\\" Masters dissertation, School of Arts, Faculty of Humanities, University of the Witwatersrand, 2013. The Xhosa people are divided into several tribes with related yet distinct heritages. The main tribes are the amaGcaleka, amaRharhabe, imiDange, imiDushane, and amaNdlambe. In addition, there are other tribes found near or among the Xhosa people such as abaThembu, amaBhaca, abakoBhosha and amaQwathi that are distinct and separate tribes which have adopted the isiXhosa language and the Xhosa way of life. The name \\"Xhosa\\" comes from that of a legendary leader and King called uXhosa. There is also a fringe theory that, in fact the King's name which has since been lost among the people was not Xhosa, but that \\"xhosa\\" was a name given to him by the San, which means \\"fierce\\" or \\"angry\\" in Khoisan languages. The Xhosa people refer to themselves as the amaXhosa, and to their language as isiXhosa. Presently approximately 8 million Xhosa people are distributed across the country, and the Xhosa language is South Africa's second-most- populous home language, after the Zulu language, to which Xhosa is closely related. The pre-1994 apartheid system of Bantustans denied the Xhosa South African citizenship, but enabled them to have self-governing \\"homelands\\" namely; Transkei and Ciskei, now both a part of the Eastern Cape Province where most Xhosa remain. Many Xhosa live in Cape Town (eKapa in Xhosa), East London (eMonti), and Port Elizabeth (eBhayi). the majority of Xhosa speakers, approximately 5.3 million, lived in the Eastern Cape, followed by the Western Cape (approximately 1 million), Gauteng (671,045), the Free State (246,192), KwaZulu-Natal (219,826), North West (214,461), Mpumalanga (46,553), the Northern Cape (51,228), and Limpopo (14,225). Xhosa settlement in Eastern Cape  History  The Xhosa are part of the South African Nguni migration which slowly moved south from the region around the Great Lakes. Xhosa people were already well established by the time of the Dutch arrival in the mid-17th century, and occupied much of eastern South Africa from around the Great Fish River area to lands inhabited by Zulu-speakers south of the modern city of Durban. Xhosa people, 1848 The Xhosa and white settlers first encountered one another around East London in 1686 when survivors of the wrecked ship 'Stavenisse' were taken in as guests by the then Xhosa ruler named Togu.History of South Africa 1486 - 1691, GM Theal, London 1888 In the late 18th century Afrikaner trekboers migrating outwards from Cape Town came into conflict with Xhosa pastoralists around the Great Fish River region of the Eastern Cape. Following more than 20 years of intermittent conflict, from 1811 to 1812, the Xhosas were forced east by the British Empire in the Third Frontier War. In the years following, many tribes found in the north eastern parts of South Africa were pushed west into Xhosa country by the expansion of the Zulus in Natal, as the northern Nguni put pressure on the southern Nguni as part of the historical process known as the mfecane, or \\"scattering\\". The Xhosa-speaking people received these scattered tribes and assimilated them into their cultural way of life and followed Xhosa traditions. The Xhosa called these various tribes AmaMfengu, meaning wanderers, and were made up of tribes such as the amaBhaca, amaBhele, amaHlubi, amaZizi and Rhadebe. These newcomers came to speak Xhosa and are sometimes considered to be Xhosa. Xhosa unity and ability to resist colonial expansion was to be weakened by the famines and political divisions that followed the cattle-killing movement of 1856‚Äì1858. Historians now view this movement as a millennialist response, both directly to a lung disease spreading among Xhosa cattle at the time, and less directly to the stress to Xhosa society caused by the continuing loss of their territory and autonomy. Some historians argue that this early absorption into the wage economy is the ultimate origin of the long history of trade union membership and political leadership among Xhosa people. That history manifests itself today in high degrees of Xhosa representation in the leadership of the African National Congress, South Africa's ruling political party.  Language  Map of South Africa showing the primary Xhosa language speech area in green Xhosa is an agglutinative tonal language of the Bantu family. While the Xhosas call their language \\"isiXhosa\\", it is usually referred to as \\"Xhosa\\" in English. Written Xhosa uses a Latin alphabet‚Äìbased system. Xhosa is spoken by about 18% of the South African population, and has some mutual intelligibility with Zulu, especially Zulu spoken in urban areas. Many Xhosa speakers, particularly those living in urban areas, also speak Zulu and/or Afrikaans and/or English.  Folklore and religion  Traditional healers of South Africa include diviners (amagqirha). This job is mostly taken by women, who spend five years in apprenticeship. There are also herbalists (amaxhwele), prophets (izanuse), and healers (iinyanga) for the community. The Xhosas have a strong oral tradition with many stories of ancestral heroes; according to tradition, the leader from whose name the Xhosa people take their name was the first King of the nation. One of Xhosa's descendants named Phalo gave birth to two sons, Gcaleka kaPhalo, the heir, and Rarabe ka Phalo, a son from the Right Hand house. Rarabe was a great warrior and a man of great ability who was much loved by his father. Gcaleka was a meek and listless man who did not possess all the qualities befitting of a future king. Matters were also complicated by Gcaleka's initiation as a diviner, which was a forbidden practice for members of the royal family. Seeing the popularity of his brother and fearing that he might one day challenge him for the throne, Gcaleka attempted to usurp the throne from his father, but Rarabe would come to his father's aid and quell the insurrection. With the blessing of his father, who provided him retinue and also accompanied him; Rarabe would leave the great place and settle in the Amathole Mountains region. Rarabe, through his military prowess, subjugated various tribes he found in the region and would buy lands from the Khoikhoi to establish his own kingdom. The amaXhosa would from then on be split into two kingdoms under the senior amaGcaleka and the junior amaRharhabe. The AmaRharhabe branch of the AmaXhosa is under the leadership of King Jonguxolo Sandile (Ah! Vululwandle!), who was named and anointed King at the Special Official Funeral of his mother, Queen Noloyiso Sandile Aah! Noloyiso, who was a daughter of King Cyprian Bhekuzulu Nyangayezizwe kaSolomon and sister to the current reigning Zulu monarch Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu. The AmaGcaleka are currently under the regency of Chief Anderson Dumehleli Mapasa as a result of the death of the monarch, King Mpendulo Sigcawu (Ah! Zwelonke!) .Xhosa, Article at everyculture.com The key figure in the Xhosa oral tradition is the imbongi (plural: iimbongi) or praise singer. imbongi traditionally live close to the chief's \\"great place\\" (the cultural and political focus of his activity); they accompany the chief on important occasions ‚Äì the imbongi Zolani Mkiva preceded Nelson Mandela at his Presidential inauguration in 1994. imbongis' poetry, called imibongo, praises the actions and adventures of chiefs and ancestors. The supreme being is called uThixo or uQamata. In Xhosa tradition the ancestors act as intermediaries between the living and God; they are honoured in rituals in order to bring good fortune. Dreams play an important role in divination and contact with ancestors. Traditional religious practice features rituals, initiations, and feasts. Modern rituals typically pertain to matters of illness and psychological well-being. Christian missionaries established outposts among the Xhosa in the 1820s, and the first Bible translation was in the mid-1850s, partially done by Henry Hare Dugmore. Xhosa did not convert in great numbers until the 20th century, but now many are Christian, particularly within the African initiated churches such as the Zion Christian Church. Some denominations combine Christianity with traditional beliefs.  Rites of passage  The Xhosa are a South African cultural group who emphasise traditional practices and customs inherited from their forefathers. Each person within the Xhosa culture has his or her place which is recognised by the entire community. Starting from birth, a Xhosa person goes through graduation stages which recognise his growth and assign him a recognised place in the community. Each stage is marked by a specific ritual aimed at introducing the individual to their counterparts and also to their ancestors. Starting from imbeleko, a ritual performed to introduce a new born to the ancestors, to umphumo (the homecoming), from inkwenkwe (a boy) to indoda (a man). These rituals and ceremonies are sancrosact to the identity and heritage of the Xhosa and other African descendents. Though some western scholars question the relevance of these practices today, even urbanised Xhosa people do still follow them. The ulwaluko and intonjane are also traditions which separated this tribe from the rest of the Nguni tribes. These are performed to mark the transition from child to adulthood. Zulus once performed the ritual but King Shaka stopped it because of war in the 1810s. In 2009 it was reintroduced by King Goodwill Zwelithini Zulu, not as a custom, but as a medical procedure to curb HIV infections. All these rituals are symbolic of one's development. Before each is performed, the individual spends time with community elders to prepare for the next stage. The elders' teachings are not written, but transmitted from generation to generation by oral tradition. The iziduko (clan) for instance‚Äîwhich matters most to the Xhosa identity (even more than names and surnames) are transferred from one to the other through oral tradition. Knowing your isiduko is vital to the Xhosas and it is considered a shame and uburhanuka (lack-of-identity) if one doesn't know one's clan. This is considered so important that when two strangers meet for the first time, the first identity that gets shared is isiduko. It is so important that two people with the same surname but different clan names are considered total strangers, but two people from the same clan but with different surnames are regarded as close relatives. This forms the roots of ubuntu (human kindness) ‚Äì a behaviour synonymous to this tribe as extending a helping hand to a complete stranger when in need. Ubuntu goes further than just helping one another ‚Äì it is so deep that it even extends to looking after and reprimanding your neighbour's child when in the wrong. Hence the saying \\"it takes a village to raise a child\\". One traditional ritual that is still regularly practiced is the manhood ritual, a secret rite that marks the transition from boyhood to manhood, ulwaluko. After ritual circumcision, the initiates (abakwetha) live in isolation for up to several weeks, often in the mountains. During the process of healing they smear white clay on their bodies and observe numerous customs. In modern times the practice has caused controversy, with over 825 circumcision- and initiation-related deaths since 1994, and the spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, via the practice of circumcising initiates with the same blade. In March 2007, a controversial mini-series dealing with Xhosa circumcision and initiation rites debuted on South African Broadcasting Corporation. Titled Umthunzi Wentaba, the series was taken off the air after complaints by traditional leaders that the rites are secret and not to be revealed to non-initiates and women. In January 2014 the website ulwaluko.co.za was released by a Dutch medical doctor. It features a gallery of photographs of injured penises, which sparked outrage amongst traditional leaders in the Eastern Cape. The South African Film and Publication Board ruled that the website was \\"scientific with great educative value\\", addressing a \\"societal problem needing urgent intervention\\". Girls are also initiated into womanhood (Intonjane). They too are secluded, though for a shorter period. Female initiates are not circumcised. Other rites include the seclusion of mothers for ten days after giving birth, and the burial of the afterbirth and umbilical cord near the village. This is reflected in the traditional greeting Inkaba yakho iphi?, literally \\"where is your navel?\\" The answer \\"tells someone where you live, what your clan affiliation is, and what your social status is and contains a wealth of undisclosed cultural information. Most importantly, it determines where you belong\\". Rituals surrounding umtshato (Xhosa marriage) Xhosa marriage, umtshato, is one that is filled with a number of customs and rituals which relate to the upkeep of Xhosa traditional practices. These rituals have been practiced for decades by the Xhosa people and have been incorporated into modern day Xhosa marriages as well. The purpose of the practices is to bring together two different families and to give guidance to the newly wed couple throughout.http://www.middelburgec.co.za/page/culture =Ukuthwalwa= To start off the procedures the male intending to marry goes through Ukuthwalwa which entails him choosing his future bride and making his intentions of marriage known, how ever this practice was not done by all the tribes within the xhosa people. In modern day, the man and woman would most likely have been in courtship or a relationship prior to Ukuthwalwa. Decades before Ukuthwalwa would entail legal bridal abduction, where the man could choose a woman of his liking to be his bride and go into negotiations with the family of the bride without her knowledge or consent. She would have to abide to the marriage as per tradition. =Isiduko= Following Ukuthwala, the man will then be in discussion with his parents or relatives to inform them of his choice in bride. During this discussion the clan name, isiduko, of the woman would be revealed and researched. If it were found that the woman and the man share the same clan name they would not be allowed to proceed with the marriage as it is said that people with the same clan name are of the same relation and cannot be wed. =Ikhazi= Once discussions with the family are complete and satisfactory information about the woman is acquired then the family of the man will proceed to appoint marriage negotiators. It is these very negotiators that will travel to the family of the woman to make known the man and his intentions. Once the negotiators reach the family of the woman they will be kept in the kraal, inkundla, of the woman's family. If the family does not possess a kraal they will simply be kept outside the household as they will not be allowed to enter the household without the acknowledgment and acceptance of the woman's family. It is here where the lobola (dowry) negotiations will begin. The family of the woman will give them a bride-price and a date for which they must return to pay that price. The bride-price is dependent on numerous things such as her level of education, the wealth status of her family in comparison to that of the man's family, what the man stands to gain in the marriage and the overall desirability of the woman. The payment of the bride-price could be in either cattle or money depending on the family of the woman. The modern Xhosa families would rather prefer money as most are situated in the urban cities where there would be no space nor permits for livestock. Upon return of the man's family on the given date, they will pay the bride-price and bring along gifts of offering such as livestock and alcoholic beverages, iswazi, to be drunk by the family of the bride. Once the lobola from the man's negotiators is accepted then they will be considered married by the Xhosa tradition and the celebrations would commence. These include slaughtering of the livestock as a grateful gesture to their ancestors as well as pouring a considerable amount of the alcoholic beverages on the ground of the bride's household to give thanks to their ancestors. The groom's family is then welcomed into the family and traditional beer, Umqombothi, will be prepared for the groom's family as a token of appreciation from the bride's family. =Ukuyalwa= To solidify their unity the family of the bride will head to the groom's household where the elders will address her with regards to how to carry herself and dress appropriately at her newly found household, this is called Ukuyalwa. Furthermore, a new name will also be given to her by the women of the groom's family and this name signifies the bond of the two families. Xhosa burial practices Burial practices and customs include a specific sequence of events and rituals which need to be performed in order to regard a funeral as dignified. Once the family has been notified that a member has died, the extended family comes together in preparation for the burial of the deceased. The \\"umkhapho\\" (to accompany) ritual is performed in order to accompany the spirit of the deceased to the land of the ancestors. The local male clan leader or his proxy is the one who facilitates the process. The purpose of umkhapho is to keep the bonds between the deceased person and the bereaved alive so that the deceased may be able to return later and communicate as an ancestor. During this ritual, an animal such as a goat is slaughtered. A larger animal like a cow may also be slaughtered for an important person like a head of the family whilst a goat without a blemish may be slaughtered for others. Further customs include the emptying the main bedroom of the bereaving family, known as 'indlu enkulu'. This room is where most of the last respects will be paid by family and friends. The emptying of the room is done in order to create space for extended family members to be able to mourn in the main room. The first family members and/or neighbours to arrive arrange the main bedroom to accommodate this seating arrangement by placing a traditional grass mat (ukhukho) or mattress on the floor. Mourners do not require an invitation to attend a funeral and everyone who can and would like to attend is welcome. This means that the bereaved family has to cater for an unknown number of mourners. Traditionally, mourners were fed with 'inkobe', which is boiled dried corn and water, and the corn was taken from the family food reserves as well as donated by family members and neighbours. In the 21st century, it is regarded as taboo to feed mourners with 'inkobe' and, as a result of shame, funeral catering has become a lucrative business for the industry during burial events. Xhosa woman preparing food for large groups of people On the day of burial, before extended family members disperse to their homes, the ukuxukuxa (cleansing) ritual occurs and a goat or sheep or even a fowl is slaughtered.SIPHE POTELWA.

There are songs for various ritual occasions; one of the best-known Xhosa songs is a wedding song called \\"Qongqothwane\\", performed by Miriam Makeba as \\"Click Song #1\\". Besides Makeba, several modern groups record and perform in Xhosa. Missionaries introduced the Xhosa to Western choral singing. \\"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\\", part of the National anthem of South Africa is a Xhosa hymn written in 1897 by Enoch Sontonga. The first newspapers, novels, and plays in Xhosa appeared in the 19th century, and Xhosa poetry is also gaining renown. Several films have been shot in the Xhosa language. U-Carmen eKhayelitsha is a modern remake of Bizet's 1875 opera Carmen. It is shot entirely in Xhosa, and combines music from the original opera with traditional African music. It takes place in the Cape Town township of Khayelitsha. Black Panther, which is an American movie that made over a billion dollars at box office also features the Xhosa language. Xhosa beadwork Beads are small round objects made of glass, wood, metal, nutshell, bone seed and the likes, which are then pierced for stringing.Encyclopedia,com. http://www.encyclopedia.com/fashion/encyclopedias- almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/beads. Before glass beads were introduced, people used natural materials to make beads. Xhosa people relied on the San to sell beads to them through trade or barter exchange. Xhosa people would give hemp to the San in exchange for beads. The beads made by the San were made out of ostrich egg shells which were chipped to small size, bored and polished and strung into sinews. Producing them took a long time, so they were scarce, highly priced, valued and in demand. It is recorded that it was only in the 1930s that the Portuguese introduced glass beads through trade. Xhosa beadwork and its symbolism Adornments serve a particular purpose across different cultures as social markers. They are used to ascertain where one belongs to with regards to identity, history and geographical location. They reveal personal information with regards to age and gender and social class as some beads were meant to be worn by royalty. Beadwork creates a sense of belonging and cultural identity and traditions hence people draw their cultural ways of living and meanings, as Xhosa people use them as social markers. Xhosa people believe that the beads also create a link between the living and the ancestors as diviners use them during rituals. Thus beads have some spiritual significance. Social identities/markers with regards to age, gender, grade, marital status, social rank or role and the spiritual state can be ascertained through Xhosa beadwork. Symbolic references are drawn from the beads through the colour, pattern, formation and motifs. However, it ought to be taken into cognisance that some of these messages are limited to a certain group or between two people. In Xhosa culture beads represent the organisational framework of the people and the rites of passage that people have gone through as the beads are representative of the stages of one's life. Motifs on the beads often used include trees, diamonds, quadrangles, chevrons, triangles, circles, parallel lines that form a pattern that is exclusive to certain age groups. Although the beadwork has some cultural significance with certain motifs having exclusive meanings, the creator of the beadwork has creative control and can create and draw meaning from individual preference. Thus the meanings drawn from the beadwork are not rigidly set. Among the Thembu (a tribe in the Eastern Cape often erroneously referred to be a Xhosa tribe), after circumcision, the men wore, and still wear, skirts, turbans and a wide bead collar. A waistcoat, long necklaces, throat bands, armbands, leggings and belts are part of his regalia. The dominant colours in the beadwork are white and navy blue, with some yellow and green beads symbolising fertility and a new life, respectively. Xhosa people regard white as the colour of purity and mediation; white beads are still used as offerings to spirits or to the creator. Amagqirha/diviners use white beads when communicating with the ancestors . These diviners also carry with them beaded spears, which are associated with the ancestors that inspire the diviner; beaded horns; and calabashes, to hold medicinal products or snuff. \\"Amageza\\", a veil made of beads, is also part of their regalia, they use these beads by swaying them in someone's eyes so as to induce a trance-like state. Inkciyo is a beaded skirt that serves as a garment covering the pubic area. Among the Pondo people (Xhosa clan) the beads are turquoise and white in colour. This skirt is worn during a virginity testing ceremony among Xhosa people undergoing their rites of passage into womanhood. Impempe is a whistle that has a necklace on it, the whistle symbolises one's introduction to teenagehood. Xhosa beadwork and other cultural beadworks have cultural ties, but nowadays beads are also worn as fashion pieces, too, either as cultural appreciation or appropriation. The use of cultural beadworks as fashion pieces means that anyone can wear these pieces without having to belong to that cultural group.The Traditional Way Of Dressing In The Xhosa Culture. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhX7DqcWgbM Clothing Traditional Xhosa clothing The Xhosa culture has a traditional dress code informed by the individuals social standing portraying different stages of life. The 'red blanket people' (Xhosa people) have a custom of wearing red blankets dyed with red ochre, the intensity of the colour varying from tribe to tribe. Other clothing includes beadwork and printed fabrics. Although in general, Xhosa lifestyle has been adapted to Western traditions, the Xhosa people still wear traditional attire for special cultural activities. The various tribes have their own variations of traditional dress which includes the colour of their garments and beadwork. This allows for different Xhosa groups to be able to be distinguishable from one another due to their different styles of dress. The Gcaleka women, for instance, encase their arms and legs in beads and brass bangles and some also wear neck beads.The Xhosa. https://www.ru.ac.za/media/rhodesuniversity/content/facultyofeducation/.../Xhosa.pdf page 7-9 Accessed 17 July 2018 =Women= Unmarried women often wear wraps tied around their shoulders, leaving their breasts exposed.

Under apartheid, adult literacy rates were as low as 30%, and studies estimated the literacy level of first-language Xhosa speakers at approximately 50%.Ethnologue.com, Ethnologue entry There have been advances since then, however. Education in primary-schools serving Xhosa- speaking communities is conducted in Xhosa, but this is replaced by English after the early primary grades. Xhosa is still considered as a studied subject, however, and it is possible to major in Xhosa at university level. Most of the students at Walter Sisulu University and University of Fort Hare speak Xhosa. Rhodes University in Grahamstown, additionally, offers courses in Xhosa for both mother-tongue and non-mother-tongue speakers. These courses both include a cultural studies component. Professor Russel H. Kaschula, Head of the School of Languages at Rhodes, has published multiple papers on Xhosa culture and oral literature. The effects of government policies during the years of apartheid can still be seen in the poverty of the Xhosa who still reside in the Eastern Cape. During this time, Xhosa males could only seek employment in the mining industry as so-called migrant labourers. Since the collapse of apartheid, individuals can move freely.

He donated extensive properties to the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Dublin, acted as witness for early gifts to the cathedral, and was a partisan for the Bigods, the de Clares, the de Lacys and other Norman magnates. Biography =Early life= The birthplace of Gilbert de Lyvet is unknown, although he was likely born in Sussex, England, where the Levett family had their seat from about the time of the Norman Conquest. The family later became Lords of the Manor of Firle, Sussex, and received extensive grants of land across the south of England. They were sublords of the de Ferrers family, originating from the village of Livet in Normandy within the original de Ferrers barony. =Mayor= Gilbert de Lyvet was a citizen of Dublin from 1229-1244. He served as Mayor of Dublin for four one-year terms, 1233‚Äì1234, 1235‚Äì1236, and was re-elected for a third term from 1236-1237. de Lyvet was frequently engaged in business in the city, and was a partisan of the most powerful Norman lords of Ireland. He was a witness to a 1210 gift by Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke to The Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, in honour of her father Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, whose 'Strongbow' tomb is within the Cathedral. de Lyvet was also a merchant with wide trading interests, and old Irish records note that he often traded with France using his own ships. He is frequently in Latin charters relating to church business in Dublin. de Lyvet acted in state matters involving the King of Connaught, the De Clares, the le Bruns, the De Burghs, Dermot MacMurrough, the Marshals and others. In 1234, de Lyvet and his wife also made gifts of land, including a \\"stone hall and cellars outside the King's gate\\" to the Holy Trinity Church, today's Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. de Lyvet and his wife lived in a stone hall not far from the church itself, \\"without the King's Gate.\\" de Lyvet owned land on nearby Castle Street as well. =Family= de Lyvet founded a family which succeeded him in Ireland, and for a time his became among the most powerful Anglo-Irish families.It is likely that some Irish descendants of Gilbert de Lyvet carry the name today in forms which are almost unrecognizable. The Lynott family of Connaught, for instance, were the owners of mass tracts of land for centuries, and are descendants of early Normans. Their progenitor was one 'Gilbert de Lynet' in the late thirteenth century. The family's coat of arms bears a startling resemblance to that of the Levett family of Sussex. (The coat of arms of the Connaught Lynotts also features a lion rampant on a field of cross-crosslets.) It is quite possible that the Lynott family descends from the de Lyvets, especially given the well-known role of the de Lyvet family in Connaught , as well as their documented close ties to the de Burgh (later Burke) family , among the most powerful of the Hiberno-Norman magnates. Thanks to the vagaries of medieval spelling, the early Lyvets may have ended up with the name we see today. The fact that in Connaught records, the names of Gilbert de Lyvet, Reginald de Lyvet, and other known members of the Dublin family were often spelled 'de Lyuet' demonstrates that the two families are likely the same. That the Norman invaders of Ireland were often seen as just that gives a clue as to the motives behind the change in spelling. Only DNA testing will likely reveal the truth. The patriarch mayor died before 1244, and he and his wife Sibilla are buried within Holy Trinity Church. Their daughter Elena is mentioned in the Register of the Hospital of St. John the Baptist in Dublin outside the New Gate. Philip de Livet, probably Gilbert's father but possibly a brother, was involved in a Dublin dispute in 1200 which escalated into violence. Involved were some of the most powerful Norman magnates including the le Brun Lusignan family, Robert de Winchester, William Warenne and others. A murder charge resulted from the fracas involving the group. =Son= Geoffrey de Lyvet, likely Gilbert's son, owned a \\"great stone hall\\" in the city, according to contemporaneous records. Sir Philip de Lyvet, Knight, probably also a son of Gilbert, was identified in early records as a \\"kinsman\\" of William Brun, one of Dublin's most important citizens. In 1278, Sir Gilbert Lyvet, Knight, is listed in a petition of Maurice FitzMaurice to the King and Council. Sir Gilbert Lyvet was also an active businessman in the city. Reginald Lyvet, probably either a son or grandson of Gilbert, was named by Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk and marshall of England, as Bigod's Irish attorney for the year in which Bigod would be away in Wales on the King's business. =de Livet family= Documents from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries show that the de Livet family was active in Ireland, frequently being named in Royal writs and orders.The Irish village of Lyvetiston (now known as Levitstown), in County Kildare, derived its name from the early Anglo-Norman family. In September 1215, for instance, Gilbert de Livet was named in a Royal order requiring him and several others to go to the King of Connaught and collect fees and fines from him due to the English crown. Other documents from the same century show Philip de Livet, John de Livet and other members of the family frequently acting on behalf of the King, or deputized to adjudicate disputes. In one case, the King even commands Earl William Marshall of Ireland to permit a servant of Gilbert de Livet, citizen of Dublin, to retain a ship he had captured as part of the capture of La Rochelle, France. Subsequent documents over the next century saw the family's influence still strong. After Gilbert de Roche was beheaded for his betrayal for siding with the Scots in their Ireland invasion, for instance, the King ordered that all Roche's lands be turned over to John Lyvet. =Sheriff= \\"Gilbert de Lynet (Lyvet) was of sufficient importance to be Sheriff of Connaught from 1287 to 1289,\\" according to The History of the County of Mayo to the Close of the Sixteenth Century. \\"The family appear again as owners of half the castle and lands of Carn -- the other half owned by Carews -- and of the lands of Kincon, Ellagh, and Seehaunmore in Kilfian.\\" By 1302, John Lyvet was granted arms in Ireland, and in 1311 was appointed steward of Carlow with the keeping of Old Ros and the Isle of Hervey, as well as the Knights Templar's hamlet of Kilclogan in Wexford. (A branch of the Dublin Levett family apparently relocated to Waterford at some later date, as the first family member appears as mayor in the early seventeenth century.) In 1302 King Edward I of England issued a call to convene the magnates of Ireland to assist in an invasion against the Scots. John de Lyvet was one of the Irish nobles named in the writ. Marriage of 'Strongbow'and Aiofe: Norman occupation of Ireland a complicated affair by Daniel Maclise The de Lyvet family were one of the earliest of the Anglo-Irish families, but unlike other early Normans like the de Burghs and the De Lacys, the Levetts seem to have been largely overlooked by historians. Perhaps the orthography made them difficult to trace: the spelling of the name varied wildly, including 'de Liuet,'An early charter in Latin included in the Chartularies of St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin, for instance, names Gilberto de Liuet as witness to a deed from Dermod, son of Gillemoholmoc. It dates from the end of the twelfth century or beginning of the thirteenth. https://books.google.com/books?id=vP4KAAAAYAAJ&pg;=RA1-PA35&lpg;=RA1-PA35&dq;=Gilberto+de+Liuet&source;=bl&ots;=ZpCNOlGNPP&sig;=4MCWSjsGOQqbgiPylmxD7wEj3NY&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=4&ct;=result#PRA1-PA35,M1 'de Lyvet', 'de Leuet', 'de Lyuet,' 'de Lynet,' 'Linet', and even 'de Yvet\\" and \\"Del Ynet.\\"All spelling varied during medieval times, but the difficulty of the original Norman-French names, often mispronounced or having to be transcribed from the original Latin documents, made them more subject than most to errors. One historian assures us that \\"at the commencement of the reign of Edward II, the De Lynets were a powerful family in the south of Ireland.\\" By the seventeenth century, an Irishman named Levett had registered his coat of arms, and it was distinct from those of his English brethren, which was unsurprising given that the first Levetts who came to Ireland did so as heraldry was only beginning to come into use.One heraldic reference shows the use of arms by Levett of Ireland as \\"three wolves pass. sa.,\\" which was also used by an extinct branch of the Levett family in Derbyshire. But Bernard Burke identifies 'William Levett, citizen of Dublin' in 1619 as having this coat-of-arms: 'Ar. a chev. engr. paly of the first and gu. betw. three shovellers sa. beaked and legged of the second.' The standard comes from the 'Fun. Ent. Ulster's Office,' or the Ulster King of Arms (the Irish heraldic authority and successor to the Ireland King of Arms), according to Burke. These arms were strictly for an Irish branch of the family.

History The first Europeans to visit the area were the Portuguese in about 1472. At the time, the estuary of Wouri River was known as the Rio dos Camar√µes (Shrimp River). By 1650, it had become the site of a town formed by immigrants, said to have arrived from Congo, who spoke the Duala language. During the 18th century it was the center of the transatlantic slave trade. In 1826Notes from Richard Mother Jackson published in R.-P. Bouchaud 1948 and 1952. Douala appeared to be made of four different villages located in four specific locations: the village of Deido (Dido), of Akwa, of Njo and Hickory-town (today Bonaberi, located on the other side of Wouri River). The German corvette at the bombardment of Hickorytown, Cameroon (today Duala) on December 21, 1884 Between 1884 and 1895 the city was a German protectorate.Britannica, Douala, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019 The colonial politics focused on commerce and some exploration of the unoccupied territories. In 1885, Alfred Saker organized the first mission of the British Baptist Church. In the same year the city known as Kamerun was renamed Douala and became the capital of the territory until 1902, when the capital was moved to Bu√©a. In 1907 the Ministry of Colonies was established and Douala had 23,000 citizens.Diwouta-Kotto, Dani√®le (2010). Suites architecturales: Kinshasa, Douala, Dakar. √âpinal: Association VAA, p. 42. After World War I in 1919, the German colonial territories became French and British protectorates. France received a mandate to administer Douala. A treaty was signed with the local chiefs. From 1940 to 1946, it was the capital of Cameroon.Mark Dike DeLancey, Mark W. Delancey, Rebecca Neh Mbuh, Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2019, p. 176 In 1955 the city had over 100,000 inhabitants. In 1960 Cameroon became independent and it became a federal republic, with its capital in Yaound√©. Douala became the major economic city. In 1972 the federal republic became a unified state. Douala then had a population of around 500,000. In the 1980s, in Cameroon the struggle for liberalization and multi-partitism grew. Between May and December 1991, Douala was at the center of the civil disobedience campaign called the ghost town operation (ville morte) during which economic activities shut down to make the country ungovernable and to force the government to allow multi-partitism and freedom of expression.Edmond Kamguia Koumchou (2003), Le Journalisme du Carton Rouge. Douala: Editions l'Etincelle d'Afrique. = Name = With the arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th century, the area was known as Rio dos Camar√µes. Before coming under German rule in 1884, the town was also known as Cameroons Town; thereafter it became Kamerunstadt (\\"Cameroon City\\"), the capital of German Kamerun. It was renamed Douala in 1907 after the name of the natives known as Dua ala Ijaws (Njos), and became part of French Cameroon in 1919. Many of the Ijaw (Njo) natives migrated to the Niger Delta in Nigeria during the Portuguese era.

The local indigenous language is Duala, which shares its name with the city. French and English are official languages, but Douala is primarily francophone. In 2014, 63.7% of Douala inhabitants of over 15 years knew how to read and write French, while 76.4% knew how to speak and understand French.La langue fran√ßaise dans le monde, √âditions Nathan, 2014, p. 30. Urbanism and contemporary life The city of Douala is divided into seven districts (Akwa, Bassa, Bonab√©ri, Bonapriso, Bonanjo, De√Ødo and New Bell)\\"Douala, Cameroon\\", in Dickson Eyoh, Paul Tiyambe Zeleza (eds), Encyclopedia of Twentieth Century African History, Routledge, 2002, p. 151. and it has more than 120 neighborhoods. Some of the neighborhoods of Douala include * Akwa. Akwa is Douala's business district and Bonanjo its administrative district. Plateau Joss is the name used historically for the current district of Akwa. The name of the districts refer to the Douala lineage, as well as the neighborhoods. For example, Akwa was historically divided between Bell and Deido into Bonadibong, Bonamilengue, Boneleke, Bonalembe, Bonejang, Bonamuti, Bonabekombo, Bonaboijan, and Bonakuamuang; the prefix \\"bona\\" means \\"descendant of\\".

It is probably the most inhabited area of the city with many inhabitants from West Africa and from all parts of the country. The seat of the University of Douala and an important telecommunication centre of the Cameroon telecommunications are located there. * Deido is a historical neighbourhood located in the north central part of the city. It includes one of the main junctions of the city known as Le Rond-Point De√Ødo and the symbol of the city ‚Äúthe Njounjou‚Äù (‚Äúthe monster‚Äù). * Bonaberi is located on the right of Wouri River. It is primarily an industrial neighborhood but is gradually becoming a mixed area including more residential and commercial areas. It is connected by the two only bridges of the city. It is also the main opening toward the western anglophone area of the country. * Bonapriso is one of the wealthiest area of the city and even of the country. Historically a residential neighbourhood, it has become a mixed area including commercial galleries, restaurants and shops. * Bonanjo is the administrative neighborhood, with many large administrations, larger companies and banks offices, with higher buildings than the rest of the city * Bonamoussadi is the main housing area located in the northern part of the city. In a first time very residential, it has recently witnessed a significant surge in the installation of malls, supermarkets, restaurants and even night clubs. * Kotto is a modern residential neighbourhood next to Bonamoussadi. It developed in the early 1980s with the housing projects of the Soci√©t√© immobili√®re du Cameroun (SIC) and is now the prime area for the small but increasing middle and upper classes of the city. * New Bell is an historical neighbourhood of the city. It was founded in the early 20th century with the expropriation by the Germans of the natives Duala people from the plateau Joss.

It also includes one of the two major industrial zones of the city (the other being in Bonaberi).  Architecture  Palace of the Kings Bell According to Jacques Soulillou,Jacques Soulillou (1989), Douala, un si√®cle en images. Paris: L'Harmattan, p. 9. historical images of Douala document the areas of Akwa (Plateau Joss) and the port between 1860 and 1960, while the districts of Bonaberi, Deido and New Bell have almost no images. The archives which provide documentation about the city are based in Paris,French national archives, Section Outre-mer and D√©partment des Estampes; Documentation Fran√ßais, Phototh√®que Afrique; Archives des P√®res du Saint- Esprit; Archives des Missions des √âglises √âvangeliques; Agence France Press.

In 1896 a first urban plan of the city was developed during the German colonial period. The plan included a hospital, the governor residency, the palace of justice, the police station, administrative buildings and buildings for the port and customs (among those the Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House). The Bonakouamouang Chimney also dates back to this period. In 1904 construction of the Villa Mandessi Bell was begun. In 1905 the palace of the King Manga Ndumbe Bell (also called la Pagode) was built, and in 1906 the general plan of Gross Douala was established. In 1914 the large population living in Bonanjo was moved to the new estate of Neue Bell (New Bell). Statue of King Akwa in front of the King Akwa Museum Temple of Centeneire Between 1925 and 1930, during the French colonial period, the chamber of commerce, the new palace of justice, the new railway station, the vault of the Kings Bell and the catholic cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul were built. Constructions were intensified between 1930 and 1955 and in 1955 the bridge on Wouri River was built. In 1935 the Mausoleum of the Kings Akwa was constructed. In 1947 the Temple of the Centenary was built. In 1959 a new city plan was designed (Plan Dorian); according to Dani√®le Diwouta-Kotto, this plan is still influencing Douala's urban development. After the independence of 1960 a new development and urban plan were established. In 1998 a research prepared the diagnostic for the 2015 horizon. In 2005 a new development and urban plan was designed and routes and public canalizations were reestablished and created. In the same year the Project Sawa-Beach was launched. Since 1888, terracotta bricks have been produced in Douala. The publication Suites architecturales focuses on heritage and reappropriation in the architecture of Douala, and it presents some of the characteristics of the buildings and architecture of Douala after its independence. Among those buildings are the casino, the show- room La Meublerie, the exhibition hall Cami-Toyota, Union Bank of Cameroon, Immeuble Hollando, the Baptist church, Immeuble Victoria, headquarters of CA- SCB, espace doual'art, and Orange Flagship. The Palace Dika Akwa Mukanda was built in 1990. Along the city's main thoroughfare lie some of Cameroon's best restaurants, coffee houses and French-style patisseries; along the waterfront, many bars and bistros may be found, commanding views of the Gulf of Guinea and nearby mangrove swamps. Many of these are frequented by the city's large expatriate population, mainly French or Lebanese, most of whom work in the petroleum industry.  Culture  * Douala Maritime Museum, a museum showcasing the rich maritime history of Douala. The building is shaped like a boat (however, the museum only occupies 400 m2 of the building). It is located in the administrative area Bonanjo * Doual'art, an art gallery/center * La Nouvelle Libert√©, a 12m piece from Joseph Francis Sum√©gn√© inaugurated in 2007.

Education  As in most large cities in Cameroon there are several nursery, primary, secondary and high schools in the city. In recent years there has been a surge in the number of private schools. It is interesting to note that there is also a large, informal educational sector that caters to a huge part of the population, mostly individuals with a primary school certificate or those with no education at all. This form of education is common in sectors like cloth manufacturing, bread making, construction, security, and car repairing. Individuals from these informal sectors are by far the most visibly deprived in neighborhoods such as Ndokoti, Bepanda, Village, Logbaba. The city of Douala is home to a number of higher education institutions, including the University of Douala.Presidential act n¬∞ 93/030 of 19 January 1993. There are also a number of professional schools, the most prominent one being the Douala Maritime institute. Douala has an aviation school called CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Douala.

Douala has a fairly developed road network compared to other cities in Cameroon. However many of the city's roads have decayed due to years of neglect and corruption. Efforts have recently been made to renovate the city's roads, especially in the most deprived neighborhoods. In spite of the numerous domestic and international investments, the roads remain in deplorable state largely due to embezzlement and corruption. A tram network is planned for Douala, with the first line projected to open in 2021. Gare de Bessengue1.jpg GARE DE BESSENGUE ..JPG Douala International Airport The Douala International Airport is located in the eastern part of the city. There are direct flights to several European cities, including Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul. Regional and continental destinations include Abidjan, Brazzaville, Dakar, Johannesburg, Kinshasa, Lagos, Malabo, and Nairobi. The airport is the busiest in the CEMAC area and is the hub for Cameroon's national carrier, Camairco. The airport is in dire need of renovations due to poor circulation and old infrastructure. Douala seaport The seaport has of draft.  Economy  Douala is a city with a modest oil resource in Africa, but is in excellent agricultural condition, therefore it has one of best economies in Africa. However, it also faces some problems like other underdeveloped countries such as heavy civil service and bad climate (flood, tornado, storm) to business. Main economic parameters are: *GDP: $42.2 billion (2006 est.): * GDP growth rate: 4.1% (2006 est.) * Exports-partners: Spain 17.3%, Italy 13.8%, France 9.5%, South Korea 8.1%, UK 8.1%, Netherlands 7.9%, Belgium 4.9%, US 4.3% (2005) *Imports - partners: France 21%, Nigeria 15%, Belgium 6.3%, China 5.6%, US 5.1%, Thailand 4.5%, Germany 4.2% (2005) Mboppi market = Wealth and poverty = Even though Douala is the economic center of Cameroon, a large percentage of its inhabitants live below the poverty line. Recent data shows that about thirty percent of the population lives in poverty (Avameg, Inc). While the aforementioned percentage is doubled for rural regions, poverty is a growing problem for Douala due to its steadily increasing population. Unlike the rural populations of Cameroon that can grow their own foods to lessen their expenses, Douala locals are disadvantaged by living in the port city where there are not many opportunities for monetary gain.

In the , Tallebudgera had a population of 3,667 people.  Geography  The Tallebudgera Creek forms a part of the western and eastern border of Tallebudgera.  History  The traditional owners were the Tulgigin clan of Australian Aborigines, but in the 2011 Census, Indigenous Australians accounted for just 0.9% of the population of Tallebudgera (around one third of the national average of 2.5%). The village was originally called Maybree, the name of a tree that grew locally, while Tallebudgera was the name of the creek and was an Aboriginal word meaning good fish. Tallebudgera State School opened on 17 October 1877. In 1904, 10,000 acres subdivided in to 36 dairy farms known as \\"Tallebudgera and Currumbin Estate\\" were advertised for sale by auction by Isles, Love and Co. auctioneers. Blocks from 72 acres up to 557 acres were advertised as available for purchase. Upper Tallebudgera State School opened in 1923 and closed circa 1942. St Andrew's Lutheran College opened in 1993. The name Maybree has no historical record (there are no trees with that name). Stephen Tobin and his wife Mary were pioneers to Tallebudgera and their property was called \\"Mayberry\\". Tobin was known for his hospitality and it is possible that Mayberry was shortened to Maybree and became well known as a place to stay when travelling through or to Tallebudgera. Heritage listings Tallebudgera has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 17 Trees Road: former Tallebudgera Post OfficeGold Coast Local Heritage Register - N to Z, pp. 135-136 While not heritage listed, the single lane Coplicks wooden bridge which crossed Tallebudgera Creek along Tallebudgera Connection Road was a visible sign of the rural nature of the valley. Up until the 1980s, this bridge was the only crossing of the creek along Tallebudgera Connection Road and being one way, drivers had to give way to everyone heading north. The road has now been upgraded with a large 2 lane bridge.

Even though this section of the Penal Code does not define \\"adequate exercise area\\", it would seem to prohibit the confinement of calves in veal crates, as well as the confinement of hens in battery cages and the confinement of sows in gestation crates. However, this law seems to have never been enforced. There is not a single court case in California where a defendant was found guilty of or even prosecuted for violating 597t. Because this law has never been applied in a court case, there is no precedential standard according to which animal confinement may be judged. Since 597t is a criminal law, it may not be enforced by private entities through civil action, and may only be enforced by a public prosecutor filing a criminal action, or by corporations formed for the prevention of cruelty to animals under the California Corporations Code ¬ß 10400 Text ¬ß 597t of the California Penal Code states: Court Cases Three California cases cite 597t. However, the courts in all these cases refrained from determining whether the concerned animal farming practice violates this statute. =Farm Sanctuary, Inc. v. Corcpork, Inc.= Farm Sanctuary claimed that Corcpork's use of gestation crates violates Pen. Code section 597t and thus constitutes an unfair business practice under Business and Professions Code sections 17200 et. seq. In Farm Sanctuary, Inc. v. Corcpork, Inc., 2007 Cal. Unpub. LEXIS 634, the court refused to hear Farm Sanctuary's claim that violations under 597t constitute unfair business practice under B&PC; 17200\\\\. According to California Proposition 64 (2004), an individual or group may only sue for unfair business practices if that individual or group has suffered actual injury and has lost money or property as a result of unfair competition. The court issued summary judgment in favor of Corcpork, and did not address whether the confinement of sows in gestation crates violates 597t. =Humane Society of the United States v. State Bd. of Equalization= Under the Code of Civil Procedure section 526(a), any individual taxpayer or group of taxpayers may seek a judgment restraining wasteful government expenditures. Wasteful government expenditures are understood as government funding for illegal activities. The Humane Society of the United States sued the California State Board of Equalization, arguing that sales tax exemptions for battery cages are illegal government expenditures in that they enable factory farmers to confine hens in a way that violates Pen. Code section 597t. However, in Humane Society of the United States v. State Bd. of Equalization, 152 Cal. App. 4th 349 (2007), the court ruled that sales tax exemptions for battery cages are not illegal and so do not constitute wasteful government expenditures under Code Civ. Proc. section 526(a). The court did not address whether battery cages violate Pen. Code section 597t. =Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Mendes= Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) sued Victor L. Mendes for confining calves in veal crates, which ALDF considered to be a violation of Pen. Code 597t. In Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Mendes, 160 Cal. App. 4th 136 (2008), the court ruled that ALDF had no private right to enforce 597t through civil action. Since 597t is a criminal law, it may only be enforced by a public prosecutor, or by a private corporation which meets particular standards. The court did not address whether the confinement of calves in veal crates violates 597t. There are two ways in which private entities may initiate legal action against persons who violate anticruelty criminal laws. One way is through Section 10400 corporations. According to Corporations Code section 10400, a corporation may be formed for the purpose of preventing cruelty to animals, and may pursue legal action against anyone for violating anti-cruelty laws. The articles of incorporation for these corporations are to be filed with the Secretary of State and endorsed by the Department of Justice or by a judge of the superior court of the county in which the principal office of the corporation is located. Only these corporations may apply for appointment of humane officers whose duty it is to enforce laws for the prevention of cruelty to animals. Private persons and corporations who are not incorporated under Corp. Code section 10400 may initiate legal action against persons who violate anticruelty criminal laws by making a complaint under oath to a magistrate authorized to issue warrants in criminal cases. A magistrate who receives a complaint alleging ongoing or potential animal abuse in a particular location must issue a warrant to a sheriff, police officer, or officer of a Section 10400 corporation, authorizing him or her to enter and search the building mentioned in the complaint and to arrest any person there who is violating, or intending to violate, anticruelty laws. The ALDF is not a Section 10400 corporation. Its articles of incorporation were not endorsed by the Department of Justice or by a judge of any superior court for the purpose of giving it quasi-governmental powers described in Section 10400. Since it is not a Section 10400 corporation, it does not have a humane officer who is authorized to pursue legal action against violators of anticruelty criminal laws. The ALDF did not make a complaint before a magistrate authorized to issue warrants. Because this case is not initiated by a Section 10400 corporation, or by a complaint made before a magistrate, it does not fall under any of the methods of enforcement provided by law.

It was developed from a common landrace of cats in China, known as , Pinyin: ', literally 'fox flower cat' (sometimes shortened to or ;) the native cats are featured in some Chinese folklore stories. The derived standardized breed is recognized by China's Cat Aficionado Association (CAA) the US-based, international Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA). Physical characteristics The Dragon Li displays a unique golden-brown, broken- mackerel (also known as broken-striped) tabby pattern; distinctive ear tipping; large round almond shaped luminescent yellow/green eyes; and a strong full bodied stature reminiscent of its wild nature. Origin The eponymous Dragon Li is thought in China to be a natural self-domesticating breed by way of a wildcat subspecies, the Chinese mountain cat (Felis silvestris bieti). While this theory is still somewhat controversial, it has also not been scientifically disproven, and is therefore widely accepted as the origin of this breed within established breeding sources in China. (All other cat breeds in the world are known to be descended from F. s. lybica, the African wildcat. The Chinese character interpretation is based on a legendary description rather than a fully accurate contemporary portrayal of the , and as a result, this cat had been confused with the wild fox by the Chinese. For this reason, the literal translated characters for read as from 'fox'; for 'flower', referring to flower-like coat patterns; and 'cat'. This Chinese-character description was based on what was believed to be the best interpretation before modern Western feline terminology became the standard, i.e. a \\"flower pattern\\" versus a tabby pattern. is the prevalent name for the original variety in China. More recently, the names Chinese Li Hua and Dragon Li have been used internationally for the standardized breed. The dragon is a potent symbol in Chinese folklore, standing for power and good luck. Popularity The Dragon Li debuted as an experimental-class standardized breed in Beijing, China, in January 2004 Zero of the numerous Internet Archive captures of this site saved all of the photos on it, but they can all be recovered by looking at different saves on different dates. All-breed Judges Dolores Kennedy and Barb Belanger of the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) were guests of the Cat Aficionado Association (CAA) and judged the event. There were four of these pedigreed Dragon Li in the United States . In 2005, a male specimen named Needy, presented by its owner Da Han, was shown and won its class as first place CAA champion. The event was judged by John Douglas Blackmore of the ACFA. Needy was then \\"married\\" to a breeding partner in an elaborate mockup of a traditional Chinese wedding ceremony, attracting some press coverage. In February 2010, the Li Hua was accepted for showing in the miscellaneous class by the international (US-based) Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA). Since gaining international recognition, and due in part to its limited availability, the Dragon Li / Chinese Li Hua has now become of interest to cat fanciers internationally. The Chinese literary legend \\"The Cat for Crown Prince Conspiracy\\" ( ) utilizes a as its central theme.

He was one of the pioneers of modern Assamese literature. He was the first ever Assamese writer to receive the Jnanpith Award, which was awarded to him in the year 1979 for his novel Mrityunjay(Immortal), followed by Indira Goswami in 2001. He was also a recipient of Sahitya Akademi Award in Assamese in 1961 for his Assamese novel Iyaruingam, which is considered a masterpiece of Indian literature. In 2005, a translation of the work published by Katha Books with the title Love in the Time of Insurgency was released. Another famous novel written by Bhattacharya is Aai (Mother). He was the President of Asam Sahitya Sabha (Assam Literary Society) during 1983-1985. Editor of 'Ramdhenu' Dr Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya earned the respect of the entire Assamese modern literary sphere for playing a very crucial torch-bearer's role in discovering, nurturing and promoting young literary talents in Assam from 1960s as the Editor of the historic Assamese literary journal Ramdhenu. His role as the Editor of this milestone Assamese literary journal was so prominent and effective that the entire period of its publication in the mid-20th century in Assam is still referred as revered as Ramdhenu Era of Assamese literature. This Ramdhenu Era is deemed to be the golden era of in the long journey of the modern Assamese literature. All the major discoveries of Dr Bhattacharya during the famous Ramdhenu Era are deemed to be the top Assamese and Indian litterateurs of the second half of the 20th century, and their reign writ large over the social conscience of the Assamese nationhood in the early decades of the 21st century. His most prominent literary discoveries of during the Ramdhenu Era who left undeniable mark in different domains of Assamese literature during the next half century and more till the dawn of 21st century are Lakshmi Nandan Bora, Bhabendra Nath Saikia, Saurav Kumar Chaliha, Navakanta Barua, Bhabananda Deka, Nirmal Prabha Bordoloi, Padma Barkataki, Homen Borgohain, Hiren Bhattacharya, Chandraprasad Saikia, Nilmoni Phukan Sr, Hiren Gohain, Mamoni Raisom Goswami and several others. Even after Ramdhenu stopped publication, Dr Bhattacharya remained active as the leading Indian literary critic, and continued his mission of discovering extraordinary literary talents in Assam. He used to write literary criticism and reviews of much younger authors till the mid-1980s, if he found unparalleled literary works having bright promise to emerge as influential writers in the next few decades. His penultimate literary discovery was a school student named Arnab Jan Deka, about whose first published book Ephanki Rhode('A Stanza of Sunlight'), published during his school-student days as 10th standard matriculate in 1983, Dr Bhattacharya wrote his swan-song critical literary article, which was published in a literary journal Gandhaar in 1987. Through such magnanimity and impartial literary credentials, Dr Bhattacharya became part of legend and folklore in the domain of Indian literature during his lifetime. His gift of discovering extraordinary literary talents and further acts of selfless promotion of such genuine such writers made his a part of legend and folklore during his lifetime.

Army garrisons are communities that provide many of the same types of services expected from any small city. IMCOM is a major subordinate command of U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC).https://www.army.mil/article/217292/installation_management_command_to_realign_under_army_materiel_command Army News Service (11 Feb 2019) Installation Management Command to realign under Army Materiel Command] IMCOM is currently headquartered at Fort Sam Houston.  History  IMCOM was activated on 24 October 2006, to reduce bureaucracy, apply a uniform business structure to manage U.S. Army installations, sustain the environment and enhance the well-being of the military community. It consolidated three organizations under a single command as a direct reporting unit: #The former Installation Management Agency (IMA) #The former Community and Family Support Center, now called G9 Family and MWR Programs, which was formerly a subordinate command of IMCOM. #The former Army Environmental Center, now called the Army Environmental Command (AEC), which is a subordinate command of IMCOM. Prior to IMCOM, the Army's 184 installations were managed by one of 15 Major Commands. Support services varied ‚Äì some provided better services, some provided worse. In September 2001, Army Secretary Thomas E. White introduced the Transformation of Installation Management (TIM), formerly known as Centralized Installation Management (CIM), pledging the Army would implement better business practices and realign installation management to create a more efficient and effective corporate management structure for Army installations worldwide. On 1 Oct. 2002, the Army formed IMA as a field operating agency of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) as part of an ongoing effort to realign installations. Many of the issues with the 15 major commands (List of Major Commands of the United States Army) holding responsibility for base support was that the structure created many inequities throughout the Army. There were no common standards, consistent services or an acutely managed infrastructure. This created an environment where funding was often diverted from installation support to operations. Additionally, there were too many military personnel conducting garrison support operations rather than mission duties. The creation of IMCOM was a commitment to eliminate these inequities, focus on installation management and enhance the well-being of Soldiers, Families and Civilians. Centralizing installation management was a culture change in the Army; working through the transfers of personnel and funding issues was difficult. In a large organizational change, IMCOM became the Army‚Äôs single agency responsible for worldwide installation management, managing 184 Army installations globally with a staff of 120,000 military, civilian and contract members across seven regions on four continents.http://www.imcom.army.mil/hq/kd/cache/files/69B948B6-423D-452D-4636808C49A57094.pdf Total Army Strong Originally named \\"The Army Family Covenant\\" in 2007, Army leaders undertook a long-term commitment to resource and standardize critical support programs for Soldiers, their families and civilians. The covenant was focused on specific programs which commanders couldn't change. The focus was: * Standardizing and funding existing family programs and services * Increasing accessibility and quality of healthcare * Improving Soldier and family housing * Ensuring excellence in schools, youth services, and child care * Expanding education and employment opportunities for family members In 2014, the program was renamed \\"Total Army Strong\\" and commanders were given the flexibility of tailoring local programs best suit their communities.

In some regions, such as Europe and North-America it has become mainly restricted to traditional, folk and ethnic music. In other regions such as Mexico, the instrument is very popular in genres like Norte√±o, and in Brazil, it is a fixture in popular music styles as Sertanejo and Forr√≥. In art music it is used in jazz music, an important exponent having been the North American accordionist Frank Marocco and in transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for \\"Guido Deiro: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1\\", Archeophone Records (2007). Use in traditional music  A 19th-century accordion, in the collection of The Children's Museum of Indianapolis After the invention of the accordion in 1829, its popularity spread throughout the world, in no small measure due to the polka craze. \\"Once the polka became a craze in Paris and London during the spring of 1844, it diffused rapidly to the rest of the world. . . . In March 1844, polka-mania took Paris: common people, servants, workers and, one assumes, anyone else who wasn't too stuffy were dancing the polka in the streets of the capital and soon in Bordeaux and other French cities as well. A week or so later it took London by storm. And from these two great centers of fashion, empire, and influence, the polka diffused rapidly upward into the rest of French and English society and outward to the rest of the world.\\" Charles Keil, Angeliki V. Keil, Dick Blau, Polka Happiness (Temple University Press, Philadelphia: 1992), 9, 11. Except for a brief moment in time during the 1830s and 1840s when the accordion was heard by French aristocracy during Salon music concerts, the instrument has always been associated with the common people. The accordion was spread across the globe by the waves of Europeans who emigrated to various parts of the world in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The mid-19th-century accordion became a favorite of folk musicians for several reasons: \\"The new instrument's popularity [among the common masses] was a result of its unique qualities. Firstly, it was much louder than all the older folk instruments put together. It could easily be heard in even the wildest pub above the stomping of dancing feet. It was also the prototype of a 'one man band' with bass and chords on the left-hand side and buttons for the melody on the right, and you could still sing along and beat the rhythm with your feet. The instrument needed no tuning and was always ready to play, but the most ingenious thing about the early one-row squeezebox was that you couldn't play it really badly. Even if you lost the melody it still sounded fine.\\" Christoph Wagner, \\"A Brief History of How the Accordion Changed the World\\", CD booklet notes for Planet Squeezebox, performed by various artists, (Roslyn, New York: Ellipsis Arts, 1995), 6. Since its invention, the accordion has become popularly integrated into a lot of varying traditional music styles all over the world, ranging from the European polka and the Colombian Vallenato to Korean trot music. See the list of traditional music styles that incorporate the accordion. Although rarely seen many early bigband (swing bands like Glenn Miller's) scores have the Piano part marked \\"Piano/Piano Accordion\\" Sometimes, certain traditional music styles may even be tied to a certain type of accordion, like the Schrammel accordion for Schrammelmusik, the Trikitixa for Basque music, or the diatonic button accordion in Mexican conjunto and norte√±o music. It would be hard to name one country in which the accordion did not play a significant role in its music tradition. It has even been idealized in literature.Wallace, Len. \\"The Accordion - The People's Instrument\\" (1989) Online PDF  Use in popular music  The accordion was heard frequently in popular music beginning around 1910 until about 1960. With rise of the popularity of the guitar (in particular the electric guitar) and rock music, the popularity of the accordion in pop music in Europe and North-America declined strongly. In some countries however, such as Brazil and Mexico, the accordion continues to be a fixture in pop music and its popularity is undiminished. This half century is often called the \\"Golden Age of the Accordion.\\" Three players, more than any others, inaugurated this era of popularity for the instrument, all Italian immigrants to the United States: Pietro Frosini, and the two brothers Count Guido Deiro and Pietro Deiro.For a biography of Guido and Pietro Deiro, see Henry Doktorski's The Brothers Deiro and Their Accordions, The Classical Free- Reed, Inc. (2005). All three players were celebrities on the Vaudeville circuits and performed throughout North America, Europe and Australia during the age of Vaudeville. They recorded hundreds of 78 RPM records for the Victor Talking Machine Company, Columbia Records, Decca Records, Edison Records and Cylinders, and other labels.The Golden Age of the Accordion, Flynn, Davison and Chavez, eds., 3rd edition (Schertz, Texas: Flynn Associates Publishing Co., 1992) Guido Deiro was the most successful and famous accordionist during the 1910s and 1920s, and lived a life filled with celebrity, luxury, fast cars, and fast women.Henry Doktorski, The Brothers Deiro and Their Accordions (The Classical Free-Reed, Inc., Oakdale, Pennsylvania: 2005) Many popular bands, such as the Paul Whiteman Orchestra, employed staff accordionists.Henry Doktorski, \\"The Accordion and Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue\\", Music Theory: Explorations and Applications, Vol. VII (1999) Mary Pappert School of Music, Duquesne University Publication.

After most Vaudeville theaters closed during the Great Depression, accordionists still found work during the 1930s-1950s teaching and performing for radio. Charles Magnante is considered one of the greatest American popular accordionists. At the peak of his career, he played 30 live radio broadcasts and eight studio sessions each week.Helmi Strahl Harrington, editor, The Charles Magnante Story: The Autobiography of America's Great Accordionist, as told to Zello Cassolino, fourth edition (Harrington Arts Center Publication, Superior, Wisconsin: 2002) Another great popular American accordionist was Dick Contino, who toured with the Horace Heidt Orchestra and was billed as the \\"world's greatest accordion player.\\" He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show a record 48 times.Bob Bove with Lou Angellotti, Accordion Man: The Legendary Dick Contino (Father and Son Publishing, Tallahassee, Florida: 1994) In addition, John Serry, Sr. achieved national recognition on tour with Shep Fields and His Rippling Rhythm jazz orchestra during the 1930s, concertized on the CBS radio and television networks in the 1940s and 1950s and appeared in the Broadway Theatre during the 1950s and 1960s.The Los Angeles Examiner, October 9, 1938, Pg. 1 During the 1950s through the 1980s the accordion received great exposure on television with performances by Myron Floren‚Äîthe accordionist with Lawrence Welk‚Äîon the Lawrence Welk Show.Myron Floren and Randee Floren, Accordion Man, with a foreword by Lawrence Welk (The Stephen Greene Press, Brattleboro, Vermont: 1981) However, with the advent of rock 'n roll and the generation gap in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the accordion declined in popularity, as the younger generation considered it \\"square\\"‚Äî epitomizing the light-hearted music of their parents and grandparents.Henry Doktorski, The Classical Squeezebox: A Short History of the Accordion and Other Free-Reed Instruments in Classical Music, The Classical Free-Reed, Inc. (2005), 125. In Europe and North America (outside of Mexico), in contemporary mainstream pop music (see youth culture), the use of the accordion is usually considered exotic or old- fashioned. Nevertheless, some popular acts do use the instrument in their distinctive sounds, and a 2014 Los Angeles Times article reports that the instrument is growing in popularity locally. (See the list of popular music acts that incorporate the accordion.) Since the late 19th century, Tejano music has emerged as one of the leading genres for the instrument in America. Pioneers such as Narciso Mart√≠nez gave the instrument staple in the cultural music of Mexican American people. Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional forms such as the Corrido and Mariachi, and Continental European styles, such as Polka, introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians at the turn of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico. The accordion has been a primary instrument in Mexican music. It is mostly associated with Norte√±o music, which has become one of the most popular music genres in Mexico since the 1990s, but the instrument is also featured in other genres such as Cumbia. Ramon Ayala is arguably the best-known accordion player in Mexico; nicknamed the \\"King of the accordion\\", Ayala has recorded over 113 albums since the 1960s. In some countries, such as Brazil, the accordion is a fixture in mainstream popular music (evidenced by mainstream groups such as Falamansa, Michel Tel√≥, Avioes do Forr√≥). The instrument is commonly learned by teenagers and enjoys a popularity comparable to the guitar. In some regions (such as the North-East, where it is called sanfona), the accordion surpasses the guitar in popularity among the youth. In Brazil, however, the accordion uses normally a very dry tuning, which dissociates it from the wetter sound found in European folk music. The instrument was also used in the Disney song \\"Whale of a Tale\\" from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, as well as Donald Duck's song, \\"Quack Quack Quack\\". It was used in a Christmas setting for the song \\"Nuttin' for Christmas\\". The composer Tomohito Nishiura frequently uses the accordion in the Professor Layton series of games, for example in \\"Laboratory\\" or \\"Don Paolo's Theme\\". However, when 'Live Versions' of the soundtracks are released, the accordion is occasionally replaced (such as in \\"London 3\\" from Professor Layton and the Unwound Future). Every 'theme' for a game uses the accordion in some capacity. It is a traditional instrument in Brazilian music, specifically bai√£o of the northeast. Luiz Gonzaga is called the king of bai√£o. Various folk metal and viking metal bands, such as Finsterforst, Finntroll, and Turisas that have formed in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century feature accordions.  Use in classical music  Henry Doktorski with the New Philharmonic Orchestra. Although the accordion is best known primarily as a folk instrument, it has been used with increasing frequency by classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece written for the accordion is ', written in 1836 by Miss Louise Reisner of Paris, an accordionist and amateur composer. The Russian composer Piotr Ilyitch Tchaikovsky included four optional single-action diatonic accordions in his Orchestral Suite No. 2 in C Major, op. 53 (1883), simply to add a little color to the third movement: Scherzo burlesque. The Italian composer Umberto Giordano included the single- action diatonic accordion in his opera Fedora (1898). The accordionist appears on-stage‚Äîalong with a folk-trio consisting of a piccolo player and triangle player‚Äîthree times in the third act (which is set in Switzerland), to accompany a short and simple song which is sung by a little Savoyard (Alpine shepherd). In 1915, the American composer Charles Ives included a chorus of diatonic accordions (or concertinasThe orchestra score ambiguously lists the part sometimes as \\"accordions\\" and sometimes as \\"concertinas.\\" ‚Äîalong with two pianos, celesta, harp, organ, zither and an optional theremin‚Äîin his Orchestral Set No. 2. The accordion part‚Äîwritten for the right-hand only‚Äîconsists of eighteen measures at the very end of the eighteen-minute-long three-movement work. All the above works were written for the diatonic button accordion. The first composer to write specifically for the chromatic accordion (able to play all 12 notes of the chromatic scale) was Paul Hindemith. In 1921 he included the harmonium in Kammermusik No. 1, a chamber work in four movements for twelve players, but later rewrote the harmonium part for accordion. Other German composers also wrote for the accordion.See Accordion Composers in German In 1922, Austrian composer Alban Berg included a short on-stage accordion part in his landmark opera Wozzeck, Op. 7. The instrument‚Äîmarked Ziehharmonika bzw. Akkordeon in the score appears only during the tavern garden (wirthausgarten) scene, along with an on-stage (B√ºhnenmusik) ensemble consisting of two fiddles (violins tuned up a tone), one clarinet in C, one guitar and one bombardon in F (or bass tuba), to lend a touch of authenticity to the deutsche Biergarten setting. Notable composers who wrote for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century were: * Virgil Thomson: Four Saints in Three Acts (1928) * Sergei Prokofiev: Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution, op. 74 (1936) * Paul Dessau: Mother Courage (1936) and Die Verurteilung des Lukullus (1949) * Dmitri Shostakovich: Jazz Suite No. 2 (1938) * Jean Fran√ßaix: Apocalypse According to St. John (1939) * Darius Milhaud: Prelude and Postlude for \\"Lidoire\\" (1946) * Henry Brant: All Soul's Carnival (1949) * George Antheil‚Äîof Ballet m√©canique fame: Accordion Dance for accordion and orchestra (1951) * John Serry, Sr.: American Rhapsody (1955), to name a few.Above paragraphs referenced from Henry Doktorski, \\"The Classical Squeezebox: A Short History of the Accordion and Other Free-Reed Instruments in Classical Music\\", The Classical Free-Reed, Inc. (1997). In 1937 the first accordion concerto was written and played in Russia. Pauline Oliveros brought the accordion into the American experimental tradition. = Free-bass accordion in classical music = Despite efforts by accordion performers and organizations to present the accordion as a serious instrument to the classical music world, the much- coveted breakthrough into the mainstream of serious musical circles did not take place until after leading accordionists more or less abandoned the stradella-bass accordion (an instrument limited to only bass and pre-set chord buttons on the left-hand manual) and embraced the free-bass accordion (an instrument which could play single pitches on the left-hand manual with a range of three octaves or more, similar to the right-hand manual). Composers found the free-bass accordion much more attractive and easier to write for as it liberated the instrument from a limited range of bass notes (only a major seventh, C to B) and the pre-set chord buttons.Both Hindemith and Berg wrote for the free-bass accordion in 1922. Despite being invented as early as 1912, the instrument did not really become popular until the mid-20th century, when it was \\"discovered\\" by classical accordionists. The Danish accordionist Mogens Ellegaard, regarded by many as the father of the avant-garde accordion movement, described his introduction to the new accordion: He said they heard shows with \\"Frosini, Deiro repertoire or folkloristic music.\\" However, he found it was not possible to get a good education on accordion, as accordionists were not accepted at najor music schools. The best soloists could hope for was playing at nightclubs on weekends. Ellegaard continued, Composer Ole Schmidt liked the instrument and in 1958 he composed a Symphonic Fantasy and Allegro, op. 20 for accordion and orchestra.\\" Mogens Ellegaard, cited in \\"Interview\\", The Classical Accordion Society of Canada Newsletter (March 1990), 3-5.}} Symphonic Fantasy and Allegro was premiered by the Danish Radio Symphony with the composer conducting. Ole Schmidt made the following comment about the work, \\"I hated accordion until I met Mogens Ellegaard. He made me decide to write an accordion concerto for him.\\" Ole Schmidt, cited in the CD booklet for Contemporary Danish Accordion Music, performed by Mogens Ellegaard with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Ole Schmidt (Solrod Strand, Denmark: Independent Music, 1987). Other Danish composers soon followed Schmidt:For compositions particularly written for Ellegaard, see contents of the \\"Mogens Ellegaard collection\\" that are listed at The Royal Library of Denmark (Danish), also listing compositions written for him and their author. * Niels Viggo Bentzon wrote Concerto for Accordion (1962‚Äì63), In the Zoo (1964) and Sinfonia concertante (1965) for six accordions, string orchestra and percussion. * Per N√∏rg√•rd wrote Anatomic Safari (1967) for solo accordion and Recall (1968) for accordion and orchestra, which was dedicated to Lars Dyremose, director of the Danish Accordion Academy. * Karl Aage Rasmussen wrote Invention (1972) * Hans Abrahamsen wrote Canzone (1977-8) for solo accordion. * Steen Pade, N√∏rg√•rd's student, wrote a concerto for accordion and three solo works: Excursions With Detours (1984), Aprilis (1987) and Cadenza (1987). * Vagn Holmboe wrote Sonata, Op. 143A. In Europe, free bass accordion performance has reached a very high level and the instrument is considered worthy of serious study in music conservatories . Modern and avant- garde composers such as Sofia Gubaidulina, Edison Denisov, Luciano Berio, Per N√∏rg√•rd, Arne Nordheim, Jindrich Feld, Franco Donatoni, Toshio Hosokawa, Mauricio Kagel, Patrick Nunn and Magnus Lindberg have written for the free bass accordion and the instrument is becoming more frequently integrated into new music chamber and improvisation groups. The Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino (b. 1947) recently wrote a piece entitled Storie di Altre Storie, for accordionist Teodoro Anzellotti, requiring use of the free bass accordion in its instrumentation, and drawing off the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti, the glass harmonica music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and the ballades of Guillaume de Machaut. It was well received by most European audiences and was released on a compilation disc of Sciarrino's other works on the Winter and Winter label. Young generation composers who have written for accordion include Christina Athinodorou (b. 1981) who wrote \\"Virgules\\" for Solo Accordion (2009) featuring the combined use between the stradella bass and the chromatic button system. In the United States, the free-bass accordion is heard occasionally. Beginning in the 1960s, competitive performance on the accordion of classical piano compositions, by the great masters of music, occurred. Although never mainstreamed in the larger musical scene, this convergence with traditional classical music propelled young accordionists to an ultimate involvement with classical music heretofore not experienced. A number of American instrumentalists did succeed in demonstrating the unique orchestral capabilities of the free bass accordion while performing at the nation's premier concert venues. In the process they encouraged contemporary composers to write for the instrument. Included among the leading orchestral artists was John Serry, Sr. A concert accordionist, soloist, composer, and arranger, Serry performed extensively in both symphonic orchestras and jazz ensembles as well as on live radio and television broadcasts. His refined poetic artistry gained respect for the free bass accordion as a serious concert instrument among prominent classical musicians and conductors of the early 20th century. In addition, his Concerto For Free Bass Accordion was completed in 1966 and illustrates the vast orchestral potentialities of the instrument.Library of Congress Copyright Office, Concerto in C Major for Basseti Accordion, Composer John Serry, June 4, 1968, Copyright #EP247602Library of Congress Copyright Office - Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third Series - Music - July-December 1968, Vol. 22, Part 5, Number 2, Section 1, 1970, p. 1626 \\"Concerto in C Major for Bassetti Accordion\\" Op. 1 John Serry 1968, Solo Arrangement Jan. 1, 1968 No. EP247602 on books.google.com Recently Guy Klucevsek has built a reputation on combining folk styles with classical forms and makes extensive use of the free bass. New York's William Schimmel, who composes and performs in many genres, is a leading exponent of the \\"quint\\" style free bass system and uses it extensively in tandem with the standard stradella system. In Canada several performers also contributed extensively to the acceptance of the Free Bass Accordion as a respected member of orchestral ensembles throughout North America. Among the leading performers, educators and composers was Joseph Macerollo who achieved widespread acclaim as an interpreter of both contemporary and classical compositions for the instrument.

Usage of the name \\"Walt Disney dwarfism\\" is attributed to the first known case of the disorder, documented in a 1950 journal report, in which the authors described five affected members from a Swiss family as having the physical appearance of dwarves from a Walt Disney film. The terms \\"geroderma\\" or \\"gerodermia\\" can be used interchangeably with \\"osteodysplastica\\" or \\"osteodysplasticum\\", with the term \\"hereditaria\\" sometimes appearing at the end. Presentation Gerodermia osteodysplastica is characterized by symptoms and features which affect the connective tissues, skin and skeletal system. These are: wrinkly, loose skin over the face, abdomen, and extremities (hands, feet) on the dorsal sides usually worsened by chronic joint laxity and hyperextensibility; fragmented elastic fibers of the skin that are reduced in number, with disorientation of collagen fibers; osteopenia and osteoporosis, with associated fractures; malar hypoplasia (underdeveloped cheek bone), maxillary hypoplasia (underdeveloped upper jaw), mandibular prognathism (protrusion of the lower jaw and chin), bowed long bones, platyspondyly (flattened spine) related to vertebral collapse; kyphoscoliosis (scoliosis with kyphosis, or \\"hunch back\\"), metaphyseal peg (an unusual outgrowth of metaphyseal tissue which protrudes into the epiphyseal region of the bone, near the knee); and the overall physical effects and facial appearance of dwarfism with premature aging. Other features and findings include: intrauterine growth retardation, congenital hip dislocations, winged scapulae (shoulder blades), pes planus (fallen arches), pseudoepiphyses of the second metacarpals (upper bone of the fingers), hypotelorism (close-set eyes), malformed ears, developmental delay, failure to thrive and abnormal electroencephalograph (EEG) readings. Dental and orthodontal abnormalities in addition to maxillary hypoplasia and mandibular prognathism have also been observed in gerodermia osteodysplastica. Including malocclusion of the dental arches (the maxilla and mandible), radiological findings in some cases have indicated significant overgrowth of the mandibular premolar and molar roots; hypercementosis (overproduction of cementum) of the molars and maxillary incisors; enlarged, funnel-shaped mandibular lingula (spiny structures on the ramus of the mandible); and a radiolucent effect on portions of many teeth, increasing their transparency to x-rays. Genetics Originally believed to be inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion, gerodermia osteodysplastica is now known to display strictly autosomal recessive inheritance. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. It has been associated with SCYL1BP1. Diagnosis = Differential diagnosis = Many features of gerodermia osteodysplastica (GO) and another autosomal recessive form of cutis laxa, wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS, '), are similar to such an extent that both disorders were believed to be variable phenotypes of a single disorder. Several delineating factors, however, suggest that gerodermia osteodysplastica and wrinkly skin syndrome are distinct entities, but share the same clinic spectrum. While the prevailing feature of wrinkly, loose skin is more localized with GO, it is usually systemic, yet eases in severity with age during the course of WSS. Also, as the fontanelles (\\"soft spots\\") are usually normal on the heads of infants with GO, they are often enlarged in WSS infants. While WSS is associated with mutations of genes on chromosomes 2, 5, 7, 11 and 14; GO has been linked to mutations in the protein GORAB. A serum sialotransferrin type 2 pattern, also observed with WSS, is not present in GO patients. But perhaps the most notable feature, differentiating GO from WSS and similar cutis laxa disorders, is the age-specific metaphyseal peg sometimes found in GO-affected long bone, near the knee. Not appearing until around age 4‚Äì5, then disappearing by physeal closure, this oddity of bone is thought to represent a specific genetic marker unique to GO and its effects on bone development.

Reports indicated as many as eighteen bombs went off,At least 61 killed and over 470 injured in 18 blasts in Assam causing at least 81 deaths and 470 injuries.One arrested for Assam serial blasts Bomb attacks Union Minister Shakeel Ahmed confirmed 10 blasts took place, however, reports did indicate the number could have been as high as eighteen. The blasts ripped apart Guwahati, Barpeta Road, Bongaigaon and Kokrajhar. The explosions in Guwahati ripped through Pan Bazar, Fancy Bazar and Ganeshguri, which were crowded with shoppers and office goers. Three blasts occurred in Kokrajhar, with another possible grenade explosion; one in Bongaigaon and two in Barpeta Road. Indian media outlets pointed out that the blasts took place just after the Diwali holidays making the blasts even more unexpected and adding to a toll count. The bomb at Ganeshguri was planted in a car and took place about 100 meters from Chief Minister of Assam Tarun Gogoi's official residence. In Guwahati, 41 people were killed; in Kokrajhar, 21; and in Barpeta Road, 15. On 2 November, four more succumbed to their injuries here. Three died at Gauhati Medical College Hospital, while another died at the Basistha Army Hospital. Twenty others were also in a critical condition. Police officials added that huge amounts of explosives like RDX or other plastic explosives, like C4, have been used as a fire erupted immediately following the blasts. Timers were also speculated to have been used to execute the blasts, which were seen with timing almost to perfection as the blasts took place within a short span of 15 minutes. It was further speculated after investigations were initiated, that motorbikes may have been used. However, Assam police chief RN Mathur also said most of the bombs were \\"planted in cars.\\" In addition to the immediate casualty toll seven more people succumbed to their injuries overnight. =Immediate consequences= * Immediately following the attack the Government of Assam issued a high alert and called out paramilitary forces to control a potentially volatile situation. Security was also increased in the Jalpaiguri district following the blasts. The police and Sima Suraksha Bal (Border Security Force) were said to be keeping a joint vigilance along the Bangladesh border. The superintendent of police, Jalpaiguri, Manoj Varma, said that police had been instructed to keep around the clock vigilance over important public places in the district. * Following the blasts, angry crowds clashed with police in some areas of Guwahati. Some people were injured in the clash and, at one point, police had to fire in the air to disperse an angry mob. It was also reported on the television media that mobs were hampering efforts by police and the fire brigade to clean up after the blasts. The mobs were seen attacking police and fire equipment. A curfew had been imposed in Guwahati and some other cities of Assam following the serial bomb blasts. * It was also reported that members of the Assamese diaspora trying to contact relatives following the blasts faced jammed telephone networks, making it impossible to get information out of the region. * Gauhati Medical College and Hospital where the victims are being treated have reported an acute shortage of blood. The Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarmah has urged the people to donate blood. Asom Gana Parishad has directed the party cadres to donate blood. Several NGOs and volunteers of social organisations have come forward to donate blood and provide help to family members of the injured and those who have lost their lives. * In response to the Tarun Gogoi government's alleged failure to protect Assam, a motley crowd attempted to storm into the state secretariat with two charred bodies from the blasts as hundreds more took to the streets in protest. The mob, shouting slogans like \\"Tarun Gogoi murdabad\\", was stopped at the gates of the seat of government by the security staff. They also demanded that \\"Gogoi come out and see what your failure to protect the people has caused. It has killed innocent people.\\" =Follow up= On the same day a convoy of police cars in Assam came under fire from rebels resulting in seven police and three civilian casualties. =Consequences= A spontaneous bandh total shut down, was observed the next day at Kokrajhar on a call given by the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the Bajrang Dal, while schools and educational institutions also remained closed in Guwahati. Only a few shops in the capital were opened and vehicular traffic was thin with most people choosing to stay indoors. BJP leader L. K. Advani, who arrived in Assam on the same morning, visited the blast site near the Deputy Commissioner's office, where he also faced a group of angry lawyers who shouted slogans saying \\"Advani go back.\\" He also visited the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital and met the injured. The Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil, who was arrived later in the day, visited Kokrajhar and Barpeta. He also held a high- level meeting at the Lokopriyo Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport in the evening. Attendance in commercial areas where offices are located was thin, and in many areas shops and business establishments, particularly those in and around the blast sites remained closed. Few public transports were seen plying on the roads in the morning. The opposition Asom Gana Parishad observed a Black Day with all its leaders and cadres sporting black badges. Lawyers from both Gauhati High Court and the Sessions Court in Guwahati abstained from work and held protests outside the court premises. A curfew was again clamped on the worst-hit Ganeshguri in the afternoon after the initial curfew was relaxed the previous evening, as an angry mob braved tight security in the presence of the city SS and went on a rampage. The police then resorted to firing blanks, injuring at least five people in the ensuing melee. The leader of the opposition and former Deputy Prime Minister Advani visited the spot just minutes before the disturbance. On 1 November the prime minister was set to visit his home constituency to take the stock of the situation after the blasts. He would meet the Assam Governor Shiv Charan Mathur and Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, as well as visit the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital to see the injured in the blasts. As a result of this blast, the biggest in Assamese history, CM Gogoi moved to recruit 4,000 more police personnel in all ranks to augment the strength of the police force to over 65,000 before the end of the year as part of Assam's counter-terrorism plan. He added the necessity of such a move was predicated by having experienced 605 bomb blasts in the last eight years, each of which caused significant devastation to life and property. He added that police and other security personnel had also recovered or defused more than 5,000 bombs and grenades.Assam to recruit additional 4000 police personnel to check terror Investigation The Union home secretary, Madhukar Gupta, said a team of National Security Guards experts from New Delhi also visited the blast sites at Ganeshguri, the deputy commissioner's office and Fancy Bazaar. When asked about the nature of the explosives, he said forensic experts were already examining the blasts sites. In regards to more paramilitary forces, saying there were already enough forces deployed, he added: \\"We will retain them for some more time and probably not deploy them on poll duties (in six states).\\" A high-level team consisting of senior Home Ministry officials also visited Assam to make an on-the-spot assessment of the situation arising out blasts. Police said they had picked up about a dozen suspects for interrogation within the first 24 hours. An official in the police department said: \\"We are making good headway in our investigations and should be able to zero in on the people or groups involved in the serial bombings.\\" Two persons from Nagaon district were arrested in connection with the attacks. Asib Mohammed Nizami and Zulfikar Ali were the owners of two vehicles in which the bombs were planted in the Ganeshguri area of Guwahati and Bongaigaon. On 1 November, the army told the Prime Minister that it had previously intercepted a message from Calcutta one week before the incident that said: \\"Attack Guwahati.\\" The army told the PM that had known about the impending terror strikes in the western Assam towns for six weeks and had tried to prevent them. Lt. Gen. B.S. Jaswal, of the GOC 4 Corps, told the PM the army had received \\"non-specific\\" information on 17 September about possible strikes in Guwahati, Barpeta Road and Kokrajhar. CM Gogoi, who heads Assam's unified command that includes the army, corroborated the message with Singh. In admitting such knowledge he added that the government did not anticipate the scale of the blasts. The government then also formed a special team, headed by the inspector-general of police (special task force), R. Chandranathan, to probe the blasts and issue a report within 30 days. Evidence emerged that a hit-team of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) executed the bombings in Assam. This undermined earlier claims of HuJI responsibility. Police were quoted as saying a text message sent to a local television station claiming responsibility for the bombings on behalf of the hitherto unknown Islamic Security Force-Indian Mujahideen turned out to be a hoax. Assam police investigators determined that two of the three Maruti 800s used as bombs were purchased by NDFB activists less than six weeks before the attacks. Interrogation of suspects linked to the fabrication of the car-bombs led investigators to believe that there were orders to initiate the operation by the NDFB founder-chief, Ranjan Daimary, as early as September. Daimary, believed to shuttle between Bangkok, Manila and Singapore, is said to have authorised the attacks to signal frustration with the lack of progress in talks between the NDFB and the Indian government.The Muslim News Following this, the Indian government decided to clamp down on the organization and other regional outfits. A ban on the NDFB, set to expire in 2008, was extended by two years. The Cabinet Committee on Security also decided to re-impose a ban on the outlawed ULFA, Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC), however, it spared the ANVC.The Assam Tribune Online On 12 November, a Bhutanese man who lived in Nepal and fought against the monarchy was arrested for aiding the Assam attacks. Tenzing G. Zangpo, a senior leader of the Druk National Congress (DNC), a formation by Bhutanese exiles in Nepal, was picked up with the \\"home secretary\\" of the NDFB, Sabin Boro, from a rented house at Japorigog in Guwahati. An unknown source was quoted as saying, \\"After interrogation, both of them were arrested this morning on the charge of being part of the conspiracy behind October 30 blasts.\\" The arrest attention from Bangladesh based forces to Bhutan for the first time since the probe was initiated. Police said the DNC claimed to be a political outfit opposing the alleged discrimination of Bhutanese people of Nepali origin by the monarchy since the 1990s. Perpetrators Union Minister Shakil Ahmed hinted that communal riots in Assam for the preceding several days could be inter-linked to the attacks. He said that the politics of hate was a plausible reason behind the attacks. Fresh evidence put forth by the Assam Police now suggests that the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) engineered the attacks based on orders issued by its founder and chief, Rajan Daimary, in September 2008.The October 30 Terrorist Attacks in Assam.

Advani, used the blasts to lambaste the ruling UPA-led government. He said: \\"I believe that these blasts are symbolic of the sense of insecurity in the country. This also proves the total failure of the government in combating terrorism\\", adding that it was likely that illegal Bangladeshi migrants in Assam, with an increasing influx of such immigrants, could be involved in the blasts. The next day he came out again blaming illegal infiltration from Bangladesh as the main reason for the breeding of terrorism in Assam saying \\"I blame the state and the central government for the blasts in Assam.\\" He continued to question the PM, \\"I ask the prime minister, who is elected from Assam, what his government has done after the Supreme Court's landmark judgment on the IMDT (Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunals) Act indicating the Government of India for having colluded with external aggression. The government only incorporated all those provisions in the struck down IMDT in the Foreigners Act, which the Supreme Court declared as unconstitutional.\\" He also visited blast sites and met injured victims at the hospitals. Union Minister of State for Home, Shriprakash Jaiswal, also condemned the blasts and added: \\"The blasts will have no impact on the forthcoming Assembly elections in Mizoram. The Home Ministry has asked for a report on the serial blasts from the Assam government.\\" He claimed that due to the sincere efforts of the ruling central coalition government, incidents of terror in the northeastern sister states had gone down by as much as 50 per cent in the last four years. The prime minister also strongly condemning the blasts and added that his government would take all possible steps to bring the perpetrators of the attack to justice. Along with the UPA chairperson, Sonia Gandhi, were set to visit Assam on 1 November. The day before Union Home Minister, Shivraj Patil, also arrived in Assam and visited blast sites in Kokrajhar and Guwahati, as well as holding a security meeting with the chief minister, and senior police and administrative officials. He said: \\"We shall nab the culprits involved in the blasts. Investigations are on and we should be able to come out with something concrete.\\" Former Indian prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee hinted at a call for greater national unity and what he termed a collective war on terror after the blasts. =Pan-Indian reactions= The Jharkhand government also came out strongly condemning the serial blasts, while having summoned a cabinet meeting in Ranchi for the next day to discuss the security situation in his region. Deputy Chief Minister, Sudhir Mahto, described the act as one of \\"cowardice\\" and said the state machinery had been alerted in Jharkhand following the incident. He added that he expressed confidence that the UPA government at the centre would initiate all necessary steps to rein in anti-national elements who are bent upon weakening the prevailing peace and tranquillity, while appealing to the central government to provide adequate compensation to the family members of the victims. While he also denied the fact that the militant activities were on the rise in the country at large during the rule of the UPA government, he expressed concern over the recent revelation that Hindu militants' were involved in the Malegaon incident. He said this by alluding to the fact that vested interests were keen on dividing the country by creating panic. Vigilance was also stepped up along the West Bengal border with Assam following the blasts. Additional security forces were rushed to assist in combing operations to track down those responsible for the blasts attempting to flee from Assam through the border with north Bengal. State's Home Secretary, Ashok Mohan Chakavarty, said an alert had been sounded across West Bengal, with security tightened in the capital city. Further security arrangements were under review, particularly in the border districts where check-posts have been set up. A senior police official in West Bengal said: \\"A special alert has been sounded in the region. Vehicles passing through the border with Assam are being checked.\\" He added that surveillance had also been considerably tightened at West Bengal's international borders with Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Mayawati, also strongly condemned the serial blasts, while demanding that the Prime Minister take effective measures to ensure that such incidents are not repeated. =International reactions= U.N Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who was in India at the time of the attack, issued a statement via a spokesman expressing his deep sorrow and sympathy to the government and people of India for the loss of life and destruction caused by the attacks. He also stated that he \\"strongly condemns this act of terrorism in its targeting of civilians\\", also declaring that there can be no justification for such indiscriminate violence. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev resolutely condemned the deadly blasts dubbing them as an \\"inhuman and monstrous\\" crime which cannot have any justification. In a message to Indian President Pratibha Patil and Prime Minister Singh, he expressed his indignation at the \\"barbarous\\" act and called for strict punishment for those responsible. He said: \\"I learnt with deep indignation about the series of coordinated terrorist acts in Assam, which led to the deaths of scores of innocent people. Such inhuman and monstrous in cruelty crime have no justification. Terrorists guilty of committing this barbarous act must be severely punished.\\" The Russian Foreign Ministry also said: \\"The Foreign Ministry of Russia resolutely condemns the acts of terrorists. They have no and cannot have any justification. The criminals must be severely punished for their acts.\\" Bangladesh also strongly condemned the attack. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury term the attack an act of \\"cowardly terrorism.\\" Adding: \\"We strongly condemn the bomb blast in the North-Eastern India that led to so many deaths and injuries. It is a cowardly act of terrorism. Violence cannot be a tool for the achievement of political objectives.\\" See also * 2009 Guwahati bombings References Category:21st-century mass murder in India Category:Mass murder in 2008 Category:Car and truck bombings in India Category:Terrorist incidents in India in 2008 Category:Terrorism in Assam Category:History of Assam (1947‚Äìpresent) Category:Manmohan Singh administration Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in India ","title":"2008 Assam bombings"},{"id":"19997644","text":"Georg Preu√ü (24 April 1920 ‚Äì 3 February 1991) was a mid-ranking commander in the Waffen-SS of Nazi Germany during World War II. He was a convicted war criminal. SS service Preu√ü was born in Danzig. At the age of 13 he joined the Hitlerjugend and in 1937, while he was still attending school, he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS). After his graduation he applied for full-time service in the SS. In April 1939 he was accepted into the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). From August 1940 he attended the Junkerschule (SS officer training school) in Brunswick and became an Untersturmf√ºhrer the following year. From 1941 to 1943 Preu√ü fought with the LSSAH in the German war against the Soviet Union. He became a proteg√© of Jochen Peiper, who appreciated Preu√ü' obedience. But Preu√ü was unpopular among his comrades and had a reputation for sacrificing his men in combat. With the rank of Obersturmf√ºhrer Preu√ü became commander of the 12th company in Peiper's III. Bataillon. While the LSSAH was in Italy during the late summer of 1943, Preu√ü became commandant of an internment camp for foreigners in Borgo San Dalmazzo, where his company was deployed. The internees were mainly Jews, which the SS had rounded up to later be deported to Auschwitz concentration camp via Drancy internment camp. Under Peiper's command Preu√ü participated in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944/45. For his actions he was awarded a Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 5 February 1945. Historian Jens Westemeier considers the award for Preu√ü as a \\"bad joke\\", because Preu√ü had lost his way several times during the campaign, run into ambushes and lost half of his company. Although Preu√ü had not distinguished himself with autonomous decisions, which would have been a prerequisite to be considered for a Knight's Cross, Peiper recommended him by claiming that Preu√ü had been largely responsible for the unit's success. Peiper also claimed that Preu√ü had \\"finished\\" off an American soldier on the watch in close combat. War crimes trial In 1946 Preu√ü was among the SS men who were put to trial for the Malmedy massacre. He was accused of murdering American prisoners of war and Belgian civilians. One of his subordinates, Ernst Kilat, who would eventually be tried and sentenced for murder of Belgian civilians in L√ºttich in 1948, testified in 1945 that as a company commander Preu√ü had ordered his men to kill all Belgian civilians the unit came across. During the Malmedy massacre trial it was shown that Preu√ü had not killed an American soldier in close combat, as he had claimed, but had ordered one of his subordinates to shoot a captured American pilot whose pants and wedding ring he wanted for himself. For this murder in connection with robbery Preu√ü was sentenced to death. His death sentence was commuted on 17 March 1949 on orders from Washington, DC. While in prison Preu√ü got married in 1948. His petitions for parole were repeatedly turned down, until finally granted in late 1956. Preu√ü was released from Landsberg prison on 30 November 1956. He then applied for service in the Bundeswehr, but was turned down. He went on to work as an engineer in Hamburg and died on welfare.

It is about a Rajput woman named Zoya Singh Solanki who meets the Indian Cricket Team through her job as an executive in an advertising agency and ends up becoming a lucky charm for the team for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Chauhan started working on her debut novel in 2006, writing during her spare time. Her work on the Pepsi brand for 13 years at JWT Delhi, where she was Vice President and closely associated with cricket advertising, eventually led to cricket becoming the setting of her novel. Plot summary Zoya Solanki is a client service rep with an advertising agency, who loves everything about her job, especially the brand she has been put in charge of ‚Äì Zing Cola (Pepsi in a fictional avatar). But when she's made to leave an ad film shoot, featuring none other than Shah Rukh Khan, and has to go to Dhaka to shoot an ad with the Indian cricket team she begins to experience her first pangs of irritation towards the brand. Making matters somewhat worse, the team captain Nikhil Khoda insists on discipline as a norm and cuts her important shoot short. This causes her to stay back a few more days than anticipated and miss the Shah Rukh Khan film shoot. When the men in blue realise that Zoya was born at the very moment India won the first and the only cricket World Cup in 1983, they are startled. What intrigues them more was when they realised that having breakfast with her is followed by victories on the field, and not eating with her results in defeat. They decide she is a lucky charm. As luck would have it, the rag tag team has a sudden spurt of victories and soon the cricket-crazy nation declares her a goddess. Soon, Zoya is invited by the eccentric president of IBCC (Indian Board of Cricket Control, a spoof of BCCI Board of Control for Cricket in India), to accompany the team to the ICC World Cup in Australia. Pursued by international cricket boards on the one hand, and wooed by cola majors on the other, Zoya struggles to stay grounded in the thick of the World Cup action. And it doesn't help that she keeps clashing with the erratically brilliant new Indian skipper, who tells her flatly that he doesn't believe in luck. What follows is a love-hate relationship; attraction and antagonism. Zoya is luck-personified and she never ceases to be the lucky charm for the men-in-blue. Main characters * Zoya Singh Solanki- An advertising agent born on 25 June 1983, at the exact moment that India won the Cricket World Cup who lives in Karol Bagh in Delhi with her father and his three brothers' family. She hates Nikhil Khoda in the beginning but soon a romance begins to blossom between them. Whenever she eats breakfast with the Indian Cricket Team they win the following match. This prompts the board to send her to Australia with them for the Cricket World Cup. * Nikhil Khoda- The captain of The Indian Cricket Team. Tall, dark, and handsome. He does not believe in luck and in the beginning, thinks that Zoya is a distraction to the team. He believes that hard work and determination are the key to success. He is a man of integrity who tries to protect Zoya even when he doesn't believe about her powers. He is known to often talk like a Nike ad. * Monita Mukherjee- Zoya's best friend who accompanies her to Australia for the World Cup. She works at AWB with Zoya, is married to a banker, and has two sons, Armaan and Aman. *Vijayendra Singh Solanki‚Äì Zoya's father who is a widower. He was a lieutenant colonel in army and took premature retirement. *Zorvar Singh Solanki‚Äì Zoya's brother who works in Indian Army *Eppa‚Äì Zoya's housekeeper who is like a mom to her. She looked after Zoya and Zoravar since they were born. *Rinku Chachi and Anita Chachi‚Äì Zoya's two aunts and among them Rinku is her favourite. * The Indian Cricket Team Reception The book was well received by the media. It constantly features in the Top 5 of many newspapers in India. The Asian Age ranked it No. 1 for 3 weeks when it was released. According to The Times Of India, \\"it is a fun read which takes the Indian chick-lit way beyond mush and smut, right to freakily naughty. Her writing is very young, very now and very funny. Her themes of cricket, love and politics are smartly topical.\\"http://harpercollins.co.in/media_images/Dec08/4/AK%20%28TB%29%20Dec2808.jpg Apart from the novel's subject matter, cricket, that India is obsessed with, what makes the book unique in Indian publishing history is the whopping print run of 20,000 copies at the launch. \\"It is very unusual for any publisher in India to go in for such a huge print run for a commercial debut novel, but we were confident of The Zoya Factor right at the first time we read hero's manuscript,\\" said Hero Heeralal , editor and publisher, HarperCollins Publishers India. Film adaptation The novel was optioned for a film by Shahrukh Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment production company, for a period of three years. As it didn't take off after three years, the rights were acquired by Pooja Shetty. The film is set to be released on 20 September 2019. It is directed by Abhishek Sharma and starring Dulquer Salmaan and Sonam Kapoor.

It works to raise awareness amongst owners, occupiers and designers of the benefits of taking a sustainability approach. It helps them to successfully adopt sustainable solutions in a cost-effective manner, and provides market recognition of their achievements. It aims to reduce the negative effects of construction and development on the environment. History Work on creating BREEAM began at the Building Research Establishment (based in Watford, England, UK) in 1988. The first version for assessing new office buildings was launched in 1990. This was followed by versions for other buildings including superstores, industrial units and existing offices. In 1998 there was a major revamp of the BREEAM Offices standard, and the scheme's layout, with features such as weighting for different sustainability issues, was established. The development of BREEAM then accelerated with annual updates and variations for other building types such as retail premises being introduced. A version of BREEAM for new homes called EcoHomes was launched in 2000. This scheme was later used as the basis of the Code for Sustainable Homes, which was developed by BRE for the UK Government in 2006/7 and replaced EcoHomes in England and Wales. In 2014, the Government in England signalled the winding down the Code for Sustainable homes, since then BRE has developed the Home Quality Mark which is part of the BREEAM family of schemes. An extensive update of all BREEAM schemes in 2008 resulted in the introduction of mandatory post- construction reviews, minimum standards and innovation credits. International versions of BREEAM were also launched that year. Another major update in 2011 resulted in the launch of BREEAM New Construction, which is now used to assess and certify all new UK buildings. This revision included the reclassification and consolidation of issues and criteria to further streamline the BREEAM process. The latest update of BREEAM UK New Construction was launched in March 2018 at Ecobuild. Scope BREEAM has expanded from its original focus on individual new buildings at the construction stage to encompass the whole life cycle of buildings from planning to in-use and refurbishment. Its regular revisions and updates are driven by the ongoing need to improve sustainability, respond to feedback from industry and support the UK's sustainability strategies and commitments. Highly flexible, the BREEAM standard can be applied to virtually any building and location, with versions for new buildings, existing buildings, refurbishment projects and large developments: BREEAM New Construction is the BREEAM standard against which the sustainability of new, non-residential buildings in the UK is assessed. Developers and their project teams use the scheme at key stages in the design and procurement process to measure, evaluate, improve and reflect the performance of their buildings. BREEAM International New Construction is the BREEAM standard for assessing the sustainability of new residential and non- residential buildings in countries around the world, except for the UK and other countries with a national BREEAM scheme (see below). This scheme makes use of assessment criteria that take account of the circumstances, priorities, codes and standards of the country or region in which the development is located. BREEAM In-Use is a scheme to help building managers reduce the running costs and improve the environmental performance of existing buildings. It has three parts ‚Äì Parts 1 (building asset) and 2 (building management) are relevant to all non-domestic, commercial, industrial, retail and institutional buildings. Part 3 (occupier management) of the BREEAM In-Use certification scheme is currently restricted to offices.BREEAM, BREEAM In-Use, accessed 7 October 2019 BREEAM In-Use is widely used by members of the International Sustainability Alliance (ISA), which provides a platform for certification against the scheme. BREEAM Refurbishment provides a design and assessment method for sustainable housing refurbishment projects, helping to cost- effectively improve the sustainability and environmental performance of existing dwellings in a robust way. A scheme for non-housing refurbishment projects is being developed and is targeted for launch in early 2014. The launch date will be announced once the piloting and independent peer review processes has been completed. BREEAM Communities focuses on the masterplanning of whole communities. It is aimed at helping construction industry professionals to design places that people want to live and work in, are good for the environment and are economically successful. BREEAM includes several sustainability categories for the assessment, generally * Management * Energy * Health and wellbeing * Transport * Water * Materials * Waste * Land use and ecology * Pollution Home Quality Mark was launched in 2015 as part of the BREEAM family of schemes. It rates new homes on their overall quality and sustainability, then provides further indicators on the homes impact upon the occupants 'Running costs', 'Health and wellbeing' and 'Environmental footprint'. National operators BREEAM is used in more than 70 countries, with several in Europe having gone a stage further to develop country-specific BREEAM schemes operated by National Scheme Operators (NSOs). There are currently NSOs affiliated to BREEAM in: * Netherlands ‚Äì the Dutch Green Building Council operates BREEAM NL *Spain ‚Äì the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Galicia operates BREEAM ES www.breeam.es *Norway ‚Äì the Norwegian Green Building Council operates BREEAM NOR *Sweden ‚Äì the Swedish Green Building Council operates BREEAM SE *Germany ‚Äì the German Institute for Sustainable Real Estate (DIFNI) operates BREEAM DE. Schemes developed by NSOs can take any format as long as they comply with a set of overarching requirements laid down in the Code for a Sustainable Built Environment. They can be produced from scratch by adapting current BREEAM schemes to the local context, or by developing existing local schemes. The cost and value of sustainability A growing body of research evidence is challenging the perception, still held by many, that sustainable buildings are significantly more costly to design and build than those that simply adhere to regulatory requirements. Research by the Sweett GroupSweett Group, BRE. Putting a price on sustainability ‚Äì an update. IHS BRE Press, 2013. into projects using BREEAM, for example, demonstrates that sustainable options often add little or no capital cost to a development project. Where such measures do incur additional costs, these can frequently be paid back through lower running expenses, ultimately leading to saving over the life of the building. Research studies have also highlighted the enhanced value and quality of sustainable buildings. Achieving the standards required by BREEAM requires careful planning, design, specification and detailing, and a good working relationship between the client and project team ‚Äì the very qualities that can produce better buildings and better conditions for building users.Yates A. Sustainable Buildings : benefits for occupiers/designers/investors and developers/constructors. BRE IP 13/03 Parts 1-4. BRE Bookshop, 2003. A survey commissioned by Schneider Electric and undertaken by BSRIABSRIA in association with Schneider Electric. The Value of BREEAM. 2012. examined the experiences of a wide range of companies that had used BREEAM. The findings included, for example, that 88% think it is a good thing, 96% would use the scheme again and 88% would recommend BREEAM to others. The greater efficiency and quality associated with sustainability are also helping to make such building more commercially successful. There is growing evidence, for example, that BREEAM-rated buildings provide increased rates of return for investors, and increased rental rates and sales premiums for developers and owners. A Maastricht University document, published by RICS Research,Chegut A, Eicholtz P, Kok N. Supply, Demand and the Value of Green Buildings. Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, March 2012. reported on a study of the effect of BREEAM certification on office buildings in London from 2000‚Äì2009. It found, for example, that these buildings achieved a 21% premium on transaction prices and an 18% premium on rents.

Set partly in the 19th century, it shares some plot details with an earlier series, Jao Nang, which aired in 1990, and on which some observers believe it was based. Pob Pee Fah was considered by many to be one of the scariest of Thai lakorns, and actress Woranut Wongsawan, appearing in her first lakorn, claimed in a later interview that a real Pee Fah (a type of Thai ghost) appeared during the shooting of one of the scenes. The legend The story is based on an old Thai legend of a type of ghost or spirit known as a Pee Fah (), or Phi Pop (). The Pee Fah needs to possess a host in order to live, and only leaves the host's body when the host is asleep. Before the host dies, the Pee Fah must find a new host in which it can reside, and that is achieved by inducing the new victim to consume saliva from the old host. These ghosts are powerful and fearful, and if one succeeds in entering someone, it will possess them for life, feeding on the intestines and blood of human victims. A Pee Fah can be banished from its host by the performance of a special dance, in which the exorcist moves in whirlpool-like motions. The ghost is drawn out by the whirling effects, and so leaves the host's body. The original version of the legend tells of a Prince who was a practitioner of magic, and who discovered an incantation that enabled him to enter and possess the bodies of living victims. On one occasion when the prince said the magic words to enter the body of an animal, his servant overheard him, and used the words to enter the vacated body of the Prince. The Prince, having discovered his servant's action, entered the body of a bird and flew to his wife to seek help. Between them they destroyed the body of the servant. Next, the prince (in the bird's body) challenged the servant (in the prince's body) to enter the body of an animal. When the servant foolishly entered and took control of the animal's body, the real Prince re-entered his own body, leaving the spirit of the servant with no body of his own to return to. From that day on, the spirit of the servant was condemned to seeking a succession of new hosts.Thaiworldview.com, \\"Spirits\\" Plot summary Pob Pee Fah tells the tale of a princess, how she is originally possessed by a spirit or ghost known as a Pee Fah, or Pee Pob, and how the ghost subsequently takes possession of her descendants, one generation at a time. =First Generation= In the 19th century, in the northeast of Thailand, Princess Nang Fah leaves her palace with two of her royal servants, to go and live in a rural village. At the time, the area is being haunted by a fearful spirit, the Pee Fah, which, according to legend, possesses its hosts and, using their bodies, feasts on the intestines and blood of its human victims. The princess was, in fact, the granddaughter of an exorcist who had previously combated the spirit, and she had been practicing the traditional exorcism dance for years as she grew up. The dance was beautiful, but using it for an exorcism is a dangerous undertaking, and as Nang Fah makes her attempt, the Pee Fah is able to enter her body after she inadvertently takes in some of its saliva, which it has deposited on a nearby green leaf. The spirit has successfully continued its revenge against the princess's family of exorcists. Possessed, she has become Pee Nang Fah (the ghost Nang Fah), and a new generation of Pee Fah is released to continue its bloody nightly hunts. =Second Generation= Nang Fah marries a brave man and they have a daughter. But her husband discovers her secret when he catches her about to kill their own daughter for food. He offers to take her place instead, and the daughter is saved. As time passes and as Nang Fah ages, she transfers some of her saliva to her daughter and her daughter is possessed by the Pee Fah, becoming the next Pee Nang Fah. She becomes the most evil manifestation of them all, by day having the appearance of a normal woman. But when hunting with Nang Fah's royal servant at night, she changes into a beautiful princess with a green face, and pursues travelers who pass during the night. Before she kills them, she dances the whirlpool dance to appear even more dreadful. =The Last Generation?= The daughter of Nang Fah marries a handsome man and they in turn have a daughter of their own. She is named \\"Kaew\\", and is destined to become the next Pee Nang Fah in turn. When Kaew's father unexpectedly dies from an illness, a young doctor who visits the village hears stories of local people who have mysteriously died or disappeared. He investigates, and discovers that the killer is Kaew's mother, possessed by the Pee Fah. Kaew refuses to believe him when told, being firmly convinced that her mother is just an ordinary old lady. What will happen to Kaew? Will she stop her mother and end the Pee Nang Fah line, or will she become the next to take up the terrible role? The Pob Pee Fah Song and Dance In the opening sequence, the series star Woranut Wongsawan sings and performs a version of the exorcism dance, mixing it with northeastern Thai traditional dancing. Having to dance its subtle movements while wearing traditional dress, Woranut needed to practice for several months before shooting started.  Remake  A remake of Pob Pee Fah in the form of a new lakorn was announced in 2009, with the award winning actress Chiranan Manochaem in the role of Pee Nang Fah.  Pee Fah appearances in Thailand  In 2007, following the mysterious deaths of four villagers in the Sam Chai district of the northeastern Thai province of Kalasin, 1,000 residents, fearing the cause to be evil spirits, raised 35,000 baht to pay for the exorcism of a Pee Fah, believed to be possessing two of the female villagers.

The epithet came to be taken as the proper name of two separate deities in Norse mythology, Freyr and Freyja. In both Old Norse and Old High German the female epithet became a female honorific \\"lady\\", in German Frau further weakened to the standard address \\"Mrs.\\" and further to the normal word for \\"woman\\", replacing earlier w√Æp (English wife) and qin√¥ (English queen) \\"woman\\". Just like Norse Freyja is usually interpreted as a hypostasis of *Frijj≈ç (Frigg), Norse Freyr is associated with Ingwaz (Yngvi) based on the Ynglingasaga which names Yngvi-Freyr as the ancestor of the kings of Sweden, which as Common Germanic *Ingwia-fraujaz would have designated the \\"lord of the Ingvaeones. Both Freyr and Freyja are represented zoomorphically by the pig: Freyr has Gullinbursti (\\"golden bristles\\") while Freyja has Hildisv√≠ni has (\\"battle-pig\\"), and one of Freyja's many names is Syr, i.e. \\"sow\\". The term's etymology is ultimately from a PIE *pro-w-(y)o-s, containing *pro- \\"in front\\" (c.f. first, F√ºrst and Sanskrit purohita \\"high priest\\", lit. \\"placed foremost or in front\\").Pokorny (1959): *pr≈çÃÜ-uÃØo- in Sanskrit prava·πáƒÅ- \\"forward, slope\\", Greek \\"sloping forward\\"; perhaps Latin pr≈çvincia from an unattested *pr≈çuÃØi≈çn \\"lord, lordship\\"; OCS prav—ä \\"right, just\\" (\\"*straight\\"); cf. Garrett S. Olmsted, The Gods of the Celts and the Indo-Europeans (1994), p. 80; Gerhard K√∂bler, Gotisches W√∂rterbuch (1989) , p. 165. Variants indicate n-stems *fraujan-, *fr≈çw≈çn-. The feminine *frawj≈çn \\"lady, domina\\" in Old English is attested only in a single isolated occurrence as frƒìo \\"woman\\" in the translation of the fragmentary Old Saxon Genesis poem, in the alliterating phrase frƒìo f√¶groste \\"fairest of women\\".OE Genesis B 457 O√∞√∞√¶t he Adam on eor√∞rice, godes handgesceaft, gearone funde, wislice geworht, and his wif somed, freo f√¶groste. The stem was confused from early times with *frƒ´j-, which has variants frƒìo-, frƒ´o-, frƒìa- (a contraction of *ƒ´j- and a following back vowel) beside a less frequent frƒ´g- (/fri:j-/), by development of a glide between ƒ´ and a following front vowel. The two forms would originally have figured in complementary distribution within the same paradigm (e.g. masculine nominative singular frƒìo, masculine genitive singular frƒ´ges), but in attested Old English analogical forms are already present and the distribution is no longer complementaryOED s.v. \\"free\\"; A. Campbell Old Eng. Gram. (1959) ¬ß410. For Old Norse, Snorri says that freyja is a tignarnafn (name of honour) derived from the goddess, that grand ladies, r√Ækiskonur, are freyjur. The goddess should be in Swed. Fr√∂a, Dan. Fr√∏e; the Swed. folk-song of Thor's hammer calls Freyja Froijenborg (the Dan. Fridlefsborg), a Danish one has already the foreign Fru. Saxo is silent about this goddess and her father altogether; he would no doubt have named her Fr√∂a. The Second Merseburg Charm may have Fr√ªa = Fr√¥wa as the proper name of the goddess, although the word in question is difficult to read. In Germanic Christianity, the epithet became a name of God, translating , ' (Gothic frauja, Old English frƒìa, Old High German fr√¥).Grimm in Teutonic Mythology: \\"While the names of other heathen gods became an abomination to the christians, and a Gothic V√¥dans or Thunrs would have grated harshly on the ear; this one expression, like the primitive gu√æ itself, could remain yet a long time without offence, and signify by turns the heavenly lord and an earthly one.\\" Old Norse Freyr would correspond to a Gothic *fr√°us or *fravis, instead of which Ulfila has fr√°uja (gen. fr√°ujins) to translate , pointing to a proto-form *frawjaz in North Germanic, but a *frauwaz in West Germanic and Gothic. In Old High German, the full form *frouwo was already lost, the writers preferring truht√Æn and h√™rro \\"lord\\". In the Old Low German, it survives in the vocative, as fr√¥ m√Æn! \\"my lord!\\" The Heliand has fr√¥ m√Æn the g√¥do, waldand fr√¥ m√Æn, droht√Æn fr√¥ m√Æn, besides fr√¥ho (gen. fr√¥hon) and fr√¢ho (gen. fr√¢hon). Old English fre√° (gen. fre√°n, for fre√¢an, fre√¢wan) is more common in poetry, as in fre√° √¶lmihtig (C√¶dmon 1.9; 10.1), and it also forms compounds: √¢gendfre√°, aldorfre√°, folcfre√° and even combines with dryhten (fre√°dryhten, C√¶dm. 54.29, gen. freahdrihtnes, Beowulf 1585, dat. freodryhtne 5150). By the side of OHG fr√¥, there is found the indeclinable adjective fr√¥no, which, placed before or after substantives, imparts the notion of lordly, high and holy, as in der fr√¥ne bote \\"the angel of the Lord\\", conspicuously avoiding the genitive singular (*fr√¥in bote). It survives in Modern German as Fron- in compounds such as Frondienst \\"socage\\", whence also a verb fr√∂nen. Grimm attaches significance to the avoidance and the grammatical peculiarities of the lexeme in OHG: :\\"the reference to a higher being is unmistakable, and in the Middle ages there still seems to hang about the compounds with vr√¥n something weird, unearthly, a sense of old sacredness; this may account for the rare occurrence and the early disappearance of the OHG. fr√¥, and even for the grammatical immobility of fr√¥no; it is as though an echo of heathenism could still be detected in them.\\" The word occurs in given names, such as Gothic Fr√°uja or Fr√°ujila, OHG Frewilo, AS W√ªscfre√°possibly an old epithet of Woden; Grimm. \\"seems suitable to W√¥den the god or lord of wishing\\" Old English fre√°wine in Beowulf is an epithet of divine or god-loved heroes and kings, but Fre√°wine (Saxo's Frowinus) is also attested as a personal name, reflected also as OHG Fr√¥win, while the Edda has uses Freys vinr of Sigur√∞r and Saxo says of the Swedish heroes in the Br√•valla fight that they were Fr√∂ dei necessarii. Skaldic 'fi√∂rnis freyr, myr√∞ifreyr (Kormakssaga) means \\"hero\\" or \\"man\\". In the same way the Kormakssaga uses fem. freyja in the sense \\"woman, lady\\".

Early life Halesworth was born in Brisbane to Iris Kemp and Reg Kemp. Reg left the family not long after Tanya's birth; her mother remarried and had three sons. The family moved to Sydney and Tanya went to Darlinghurst Primary School and then the selective Sydney Girls High School. In 1951, she was vice-captain of the school. She worked as a clerk in a sheriff's office, before training as a teacher at Bathurst Teacher's College.Radio-Active: The ABC Staff Journal, 13(2) April 1959 She taught in primary schools for three years, as well as acting with small theatre companies and working on TV commercials. In 1955 she married teacher Brian Halesworth, but they were divorced in 1959. Television career In 1958, when she was 23 years old, she won a job as a studio announcer with the ABC, beating 200 applicants. Christine Hogan, speaking on women in the media, described her as \\"a school teacher with a dramatic bent\\".Hogan, Christine (2007) Women in media, Paper presented at the 19th Women, Management, and Employment Relations Conference, 2-3 August 2007, Four Seasons Hotel, Sydney By 1961 her work for the ABC included the show Six O'Clock Rock. At the same time she was studying for an arts degree at Sydney University and performing in Clare Boothe Luce's The Women at the Independent Theatre. Halesworth left the ABC in 1962 to join Channel Seven to host a tenpin bowling program. It was here that she met interviewer and announcer, John Bailey, who was later to become her husband. For the next two years she worked on shows such as Talking Point as well as continuing to perform on stage. One of her roles during this time was Juliet in Peter Ustinov's comedy Romanoff and Juliet. In 1964, having graduated with a first class honours bachelor of arts degree from Sydney University, she went to England where she hosted Granada Television's program The Headliners. However, she returned to Australia in 1965 and married John Bailey in 1967, despite having once reportedly said that \\"it was entirely against man's instincts to be tied down to one woman\\". Bailey and Halesworth worked for Channel Ten in Sydney and then Melbourne. From 1965 to 1968, she co-produced with Bill Peach a current affairs show on Channel Ten called Telescope.

The output of his workshop includes some of the finest English medieval glass. Biography The first certain record of Thornton, apart from a possible 1371 reference in Coventry, is his 1405 contract with the Dean of York Minster to glaze the quire east window.Marks, R. Stained Glass in England during the Middle Ages, Routledge, 1993, p.180 The Archbishop of York at the time was Richard le Scrope, a former Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, and the window was funded by Walter Skirlaw, also previously Bishop of Coventry, so it seems possible both men would have recommended Thornton based on their knowledge of his work in his home town. Thornton was made a freeman of York in 1410, but was known to be back living in the St John's Bridges area of Coventry (now known as Burgeshttp://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=16006) by 1413. He appears again in 1433, when he received further payment from the dean and chapter of York, and was recorded as holding property there. It has been suggested, though without any strong evidence, that Thornton was the son of a \\"John Coventre\\", a glazier in the royal glass-painting workshops at Westminster in 1351 and 1352, who later assisted in setting up windows at Windsor Castle for Edward III of England. Thornton could have worked as an assistant to his father before rising to the position of designer and draughtsman.Knowles, J. 'John Thornton of Coventry', Notes and Queries, No. 140, 481 Works Thornton was instrumental in disseminating the International Gothic style in the north and Midlands of England. The products of his workshop can be recognised by their favouring of white glass and yellow stain set against blue and ruby \\"seaweed\\"-patterned backgrounds, and by the very distinctive modelling of faces.Marks, p.183. Thornton's treatment of faces was expressive, using relatively heavy shading, and generally features small mouths and rather elongated noses with a bulbous tip. Thornton's masterpiece is the Great East Window of York Minster, the largest in the building and containing about of glass. According to the contract, much of the work was to be executed by his own hand, though specifically only to \\"pourtray [...] the histories, images, and other things to be painted on the [window]\\"; evidently some of the glazing would be carried out by apprentices or workmen.Blair, J and Ramsay, N. English Medieval Industries, CIP, 1991, p.280 Thornton is likely to have recruited glaziers locally in York: he seems to have been an enthusiastic teacher, and his style quickly became dominant in the area.Marks, p.182 Work thought to be by Thornton can also be found in several smaller churches, as well as in St Mary's Hall in Coventry. His surviving windows for Coventry Cathedral were removed before it was destroyed in the Coventry Blitz and have been preserved.A rare glimpse of unseen cathedral stained glass, BBC, 23-08-02 He is also thought to have produced the windows from the chapel at Hampton Court, Herefordshire, which are now dispersed in various collections, and seven panels in the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent. The Thornton 'tradition' continued in York even after the middle of the 15th century, though many of the works produced show a coarsening or loss of quality compared with Thornton's authentic creations.Marks, pp.185-186 =Examples of his work from the East Window in York Minster= File:The Lamb on Mount Zion and the Redeemed.jpgThe Lamb on Mount Zion and the Redeemed File:Bishop Walter Skirlaw, East Window, York Minster.jpgBishop Walter Skirlaw File:King Lucius and two other Kings, East Window, York Minster.jpgKing Lucius and two other Kings File:King William I, King Edward the Confessor, King Edward III.jpgKing William I, King Edward the Confessor, King Edward III File:Pope Celestine, St William and an unidentified Prelate, East Window, York Minster.jpgPope Celestine III, St William and an unidentified Prelate File:Saint John glimpses God in Majesty.jpgSt John glimpses God in Majesty File:Seven Churches of Asia in the East Window at York Minster.jpgSeven churches of Asia File:St Eleutherius, St Pirrannus and an unidentified Archbishop-Saint.jpgSt Eleutherius, St Pirrannus and an unidentified Archbishop-Saint See also *Thomas Glazier of Oxford, a contemporary of Thornton and also a practitioner of the International Gothic style in stained glass.

The station is currently owned by the Westminster College Board of Trustees. \\\\- History WWNW first signed on January 31, 1968, at its present frequency of 88.9 mHz; but with an output power of 39 watts and the call letters of WKPS, operating about 10 hours a day. The station had a diverse, free form format typical of most college radio stations. Jerome Henderson served as the station's first general manager and director of broadcasting. By 1981, the station changed its call letters to WWNW, increased its power to 110 watts, expanded its broadcast day to 18 hours daily, and David L. Barner, now Chairman of the college's Department of Communications Studies, Theatre and Art, joined the station as the director of broadcasting. Under Barner's direction, the station experienced its biggest changes into what it is today. Barner, a solid veteran with years of experience at all levels and job types associated with broadcasting, felt that in order for students to be successful in broadcasting, they had to have a combination of considerable hands-on lab experience at either a campus or commercial broadcast facility, and classroom work that was practical and adaptable to this career path. Barner's belief was that in order for this to happen, the campus radio station had to have the sound and feel of a major market commercial radio facility, with coursework taught by seasoned broadcast professionals. Unlike many stations on the non- commercial FM band, WWNW is programmed much like a commercially formatted for- profit enterprise, rather than a free-form program-based format often found at most college radio stations. The most obvious exception is the lack of commercials, which are replaced by logged public service announcements, station promos, and underwritings at certain points during the broadcast day. Since the early 80's, WWNW has programmed a mass-appeal format of adult contemporary music, first using the moniker \\"Hit Radio 89\\", with local newscasts relative to the community. Over the years, the station was named after the school mascot, taking the name \\"Titan Radio\\", in an effort to enhance school spirit, but the programming elements remained the same. The station was granted permission to increase its power to its current level of 4,000 watts in 2008, giving it a signal comparable to most small market FM stations on the commercial dial spectrum. Station information All on-air personnel are required to adhere to a structured format and tightly controlled playlist. Disc jockeys are restricted to Broadcast and Digital Communications majors who desire to pursue a career in broadcasting after graduation, unlike most college stations that are run more on a public access basis, open to any student regardless of major, as well as the local community. They typically work airshifts of four or five hours as they would on a commercial radio station, as the \\"lab\\" portion of their coursework. Those who do not show up for their shifts without advance notice are given a failing grade and dismissed from the program. Because of WWNW's serious approach to broadcasting, the station is frequently heard in local businesses in the New Wilmington area, who support the station through grant underwritings. The station has also been recognized as one of the Top College Radio Stations in the U.S. by The Princeton Review.

With an approximate broadcast radius of 35 miles from the center of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, WZBT reaches a wide audience located in south central Pennsylvania and upper Maryland. Supervised by Gettysburg College administrators and faculty, and operated by the students of Gettysburg College, WZBT's purposes are to offer an effective means of responsible communication for students, faculty, staff, and community members, to be a source of information within and beyond the confines of the college, and to provide entertainment for its audience. History Founded in 1948 as WWGC, the station was formed as a student-run media club on the Gettysburg College campus. The station was an on-campus only, closed-circuit radio system utilizing telephony transmission to dorm rooms and dining halls. Financed by the Student Chest and fully administered by students, WWGC's first studio was located on the third floor of Breidenbaugh Hall and broadcast was limited to three hours per evening, six days per week. During the fall of 1975, the Gettysburg College Board Of Trustees granted approval to WWGC-AM to transform from its closed-circuit AM frequency to a full service terrestrial radio FM station and received its first FCC license for educational FM broadcast in 1976. With initial funding from the Parents‚Äô Committee that summer, WWGC was reborn as WZBT 90.3 FM on October 23, 1978. It began as a 10-watt educational FM collegiate radio station with an effective radius of 1 mile that covered the entire campus and downtown Gettysburg area. In 1982, WZBT expanded to a Class A non-commercial radio broadcast entity and was reassigned to the 91.1 radio frequency. The station also increased its wattage from 10 to 128 watts, expanding its reach even further into the Gettysburg community. In 1991, WZBT was displaced from its studio located in the College Union Building. The station remained off-the-air for close to a year until the President's Council allocated the funds for the station to build its new studio on the first floor of the Plank Gymnasium. WZBT was reborn again in the spring of 1992 in its new facilities and was given approval to move its transmitter off-campus to the WGTY tower in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. With another increase to 180 watts, the station was able to broadcast a total radius of twenty miles. In 2008, WZBT optimized its terrestrial coverage, with a new 500 watt transmitter placed at 213 feet at the new WGTY tower with FCC license approval to cover the entirety of Adams County,WZBT coverage map, radio-locator.com \\\\- giving WZBT an ERP of 350 watts as a Class A FM broadcast entity.FM Query Page - WZBT fcc.gov Additionally, in 2008, WZBT also acquired a new radio automation system, and for the first time in its 60-year history, the station was able to broadcast twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

Eight miles () north of Grinnell, Iowa 146 enters Tama County, but only briefly. It turns west and enters Marshall County later, just east of Gilman. Highway 146 turns north on Elm Street in Gilman. From Gilman, it is an drive to Le Grand where Iowa 146 ends at Main Street. Prior to US 30 being relocated to the north along an expressway, Main Street carried US 30. History Iowa Highway 146 was designated along Primary Road No. 63. When the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926, the Iowa State Highway Commission had a policy of renumbering state highways to avoid duplicating U.S. Highway numbers; US 63, in this case. Iowa 146 has been extended northward at least twice. A section of the Lincoln Highway became a part of U.S. Route 30 was straightened between Tama and Marshalltown.

Plot In 2010, a virus infected everyone on the planet, wiping out half the population. Absolon is a drug regimen everyone must now take to stay alive. One corporation controls the drug and Murchison (Ron Perlman) is its leader. A corporate scientist, who was researching the virus, is found murdered. Norman Scott (Christopher Lambert) is the policeman assigned to investigate the crime. He eventually uncovers a conspiracy involving the scientist. He is given a partial dosage of the cure the scientist had been working on, but soon realizes he is in over his head as he is being hunted by an assassination team. Scott goes on the run with Claire (Kelly Brook), one of the murdered scientist's colleagues. They find out the assassins are employed by Murchison. Scott discovers he is being chased down for the cure in his bloodstream. He is also able to kill the assassins chasing them. In the end, Scott finds out the cure he was carrying wasn't for the original virus, which had died out years ago, but a cure for the worldwide dependence on the addictive Absolon drug itself.

It was converted to a Borstal 2 years later and, up until 2011, was used to hold Young Offenders. The establishment now houses prisoners over the age of 18. At the beginning of December 2004 the Howard League for Penal Reform accused Stoke Heath of abusing the human rights of young offenders.

In October 2006 four prison officers were injured in a riot involving more than 30 inmates at Stoke Heath. None of the inmates were injured during the disturbance. In 2007 a spot inspection criticised Stoke Heath for failing to make improvements recommended in a 2005 inspection. The inspectorate recommended that the prison must refurbish its \\"unacceptably grubby\\" segregation unit and establish proper risk assessments for strip searches. In 2013 Stoke Heath implemented the pepper course to help reintegrate offenders back into the community using the pepper principals. The prison today Stoke Heath houses male adults and Young Offenders of 18 years and above. Because of this, education and training for inmates is the main focus of the prison. Education and training courses are provided by The Manchester College.

He was also the founder, in the mid-1980s, of Cornell's program in the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology, which later became part of the Department of Science and Technology Studies. Early life and career After a brief volunteer stint in the Navy, Williams began a career in chemical engineering in 1945 but found his lifelong passion because of a required course in History of Science, taught by the late Henry Guerlac. He quickly switched his major and graduated from Cornell with honors in 1949. He then pursued a Ph.D. at Cornell, which he completed in 1952. He taught at Yale and the University of Delaware, and was delighted to return to teach at his alma mater in 1960, where he soon earned the honor of holding the John Stambaugh Chair in History of Science. Academic work His biography of Michael Faraday won the Pfizer Award in 1965. At that time most work in the history of science was still focused on the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century, and on the spread of Newtonian philosophy in the eighteenth century; biographies of 19th century figures (other than Charles Darwin) were still quite rare. Moreover, Williams studied Faraday's philosophical journals in addition to Faraday's meticulously kept laboratory notebooks, and went on to suggest that Faraday (along with the little known Jesuit philosopher Roger Boscovich) played an essential and even central role in the origins of field theory in nineteenth century physics. He then defended this thesis in a book on the origins of field theory. Williams was fond of pointing out that James Clerk Maxwell, generally understood to be the author of field theory, publicly attributed the idea to Faraday in a series of lectures in the 1870s. Williams (like his Cornell colleague E.A. Burtt, his mentor Henry Guerlac, and the √©migr√© historian of science Alexandre Koyr√©) paid close attention to the \\"extra-scientific determinants of scientific thought\\", especially the religious views of important scientists. This was notable not least because Williams himself was, as he often said to friends and students (see below) \\"a reluctant atheist.\\" He advanced the thesis that electromagnetic field theory in 19th century physics owed a great philosophical debt to the speculative metaphysical movement in early nineteenth century Europe known as \\"Naturphilosophie.\\" This view, now commonplace if not universally accepted, was quite radical at the time Williams first advanced it. At the end of his career he was at work in extending these insights concerning the complex interplay of science and philosophy in a biographical study of Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re, which remained unfinished at the time of his death. He authored several other books, numerous articles in his field, and dozens of scholarly reviews. He also served on the board of editors for The Dictionary of Scientific Biography, Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, Physis, and Rivista della Storia della Scienza. In the philosophy of science his views were closely aligned with those of his friend and contemporary Norwood Russell Hanson on the interpenetration of theory language and observation language in physics. He was fundamentally opposed to the theory of scientific revolutions proposed by Thomas Kuhn, finding it philosophically incoherent in its presentation and irrational in its implications. Teaching and Reputation A tall and imposing figure, he reveled in the teaching of both the History of Science and the History of Western Civilization, and enjoyed giving his presentation, \\"The Notorious Note-Taking Lecture,\\" to students entering the university. A real showman, he attracted standing-room-only crowds to his Western Civ lectures, speaking without notes for 50 perfectly timed and pitched minutes that combined abstract and profound concepts with an unusual ability to play to the peanut gallery. His portrayals of James I and Rousseau, along with many others, made lasting impressions on generations of Cornell undergraduates, winning him the Clark Teaching Award in 1971 from the College of Arts and Sciences. He cared particularly about the success of student athletes and devoted many hours to tutoring them privately. He moreover oversaw the dissertations of dozens of graduate students, who were each welcomed into his home as well as into his professional life. Sunday touch football games with graduate students and colleagues were regular high points in his weekly life. He often expressed his opinions on various issues to the Ithaca Journal and the Cornell Daily Sun, gaining him a certain local notoriety, or fame, depending on one's point of view. An outspoken conservative in politics - in the mold of Tocqueville, de Maistre, and Edmund Burke - he urged caution with regard to large initiatives fostered by central governments, believing, with most conservatives that humans learn principally by making mistakes and that big governments generally make big mistakes. Today his politics would probably be described as libertarian, and he put great emphasis on independence in thought and action and on individual initiative. Williams, along with E. A. Burtt and twenty-three other Cornell University professors, was a volunteer faculty member of Ithaca Neighborhood College.\\"Colleges: Community Service\\". Nov. 17, 1967. Time Magazine Williams was an courageous advocate for justice throughout his entire life. Early on in his college career, he met the son of the famous African American singer, Paul Robeson, Paul Robeson, Jr., aka \\"Paulie\\". When he took Robeson to his home in Croton-on-Hudson, the local swim club refused Robeson entrance because of his race; Williams succeeded in getting the swim club shut down until it changed its policies. He was elected chair of the History Department at the height of racial tensions on campus in 1969, and insisted that both rigorous, open-minded inquiry and high standards be the principles guiding any changes at Cornell. He was a leading advocate of maintaining ROTC on the Cornell campus,http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=118807 Retrieved 2009-01-10. of compulsory physical education, and of removing Dale Corson as Cornell President because of an alleged decline in academic standards. As chair, he fought hard for the hire of the first woman in the department, Dr. Mary Beth Norton. He did not care at all about the race, creed, gender, or sexual orientation of anyone he worked with; he wanted the sharpest and most intellectually curious people he could get to belong to the department and to lead Cornell University. Williams was, above all, a presence, intellectually, morally and physically. His more physical activities included hunting with his beloved Weimaraners, earning a black belt in karate in his forties, playing touch football, and wood chopping, a benefit of which was his many hours spent by his fireside. His powers of concentration were astonishing; he usually wrote with opera playing, children talking, phones ringing and dogs barking. A self-described reluctant atheist, Williams nevertheless wanted the last words of his obituary to come from the New Testament: \\"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith,\\" (2 Timothy 4:7 King James Version).

It was originally a Roman Catholic (Benedictine) monastery, built before 1177 and destroyed before 1293. The present monastery, which belongs to the Romanian Orthodox Church, was built near the ruins of the first monastery in the late 14th or early 15th century.  Benedictine monastery  The Benedictine monastery was built for the noble Hodos kindred in Arad County in the Kingdom of Hungary. It was first mentioned as ecclesia de Hudust in a royal charter, issued in 1177. The monastery was dedicated to Saint Peter, according to a 1278 royal charter. Andrew II of Hungary granted a yearly income of 1000 salt cubes to the abbot. The last record of the monastery was made in 1278: in this year, one Banus Paul bequeathed the right of patronage of the monastery upon his five nephews. The monastery seems to have been destroyed shortly thereafter, most probably during the rebellion of the Cumans, because Andrew III of Hungary donated the land known as Hudusmonostura\\"the monastery of Hodo»ô\\" in Hungarianto one isp√°n Itemus and his brothers in 1293.  Orthodox monastery  The new Orthodox monastery was built near the ruins of the former abbey in the late 14th or early 15th century. The present church of the monastery was built around 1370, according to a triconch plan (having apses with semi-domes on three sides of a square chamber), at a time when this architecture was spreading to Moldavia and Wallachia, the other Romanian provinces. The Hodo»ô-Bodrog Monastery was also under Ottoman domination between 1556 and 1699. The Ottoman rule was briefly interrupted for a short time by the struggle for the independence and unification of the Romanian countries, led by Michael the Brave (1595). It is likely that, during the military operations, the monastery suffered serious damages. The monastery was rebuilt at the very beginning of the 18th century, thanks to bishop Sava I Brankoviƒá (oldest brother of ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá), who resided in Lipova and later in Ineu (towns in what is now Arad County, Romania). In the following decades, although continuing to suffer under the Ottoman rule, and even the hardships induced by the Transylvanian nobility, the monastery housed the residence of the bishops who shepherded this area. Among these were Sofronie, who visited Russia in 1651, and Isaija ƒêakoviƒá, who stayed at Hodo»ô-Bodrog around 1694 (he would later establish the Hodo»ô-Bodrog as the seat of the diocese of Ineu and Timi»ôoara). From the last decade of the 17th century until 1864, the monastery was under the jurisdiction of the metropolitans of Karlowitz, Serbia and was the only contemporary Orthodox monastery of the Arad diocese that faced great difficulties. The church underwent several restorations throughout the centuries. The original structures were altered to some extent. After the 17th-century restoration, a baroque helmet was added to the dome. The frescoes in the monastery date from the first decades of the 17th century. Several sacred objects dating from earlier centuries add new values to the artistic treasure of the monastery, including the skull of a bull that found an icon of the Virgin Mary at the current site of the church. Since then the monastery has added a new church, an outdoor summer chapel, and other buildings. Today, the monastery is within the boundaries of the Mure≈ü Floodplain Natural Park, in the village of Bodrogu Nou (Arad County). The land and monastery are still owned by the Romanian Orthodox Church. However, in 2004 the Mure≈ü Floodplain Natural Park was officially declared to protect and preserve the landscapes along the Mure≈ü River. Because of the proximity of the monastery to the river, the monastery is now inside the natural park.

History During the last fifty years several attempts had been made to form a permanent puppet theatre in the city of Miskolc, which has outstanding theatrical traditions. In 1947 L√°szl√≥ Bod, later the director of Budapest State Puppet Theatre, tried to establish the genre in Miskolc. In the middle 1980s, in the building known as F√°bi√°n Mill, initially two groups started their work. The first to perform here was the amateur puppetry led by J√°nos Czikora until 1989. Beside this group was the Csodamalom Puppet Theatre established in 1986 by Tibor Korzs√©ny, who was a member of the State Puppet Theatre before, and artist of the Tokaj Variet√©. The first performance was on 26 September 1986 under the management of Tibor Korzs√©nyi. It was an adaptation of a tale by the Grimm Brothers entitled Hansel and Gretel. The artists, including Anna Moln√°r, Val√©ria Egerszegi, Aszterisz Pacadisz were members of the Tokaj Variet√©, except Ildik√≥ Gy√ºrek. Following this, Tibor Korzs√©nyi gathered together young people who were interested in the genre. The group enlarged and changed throughout the years. In September, 1990 the higher education of puppeteers was launched with twelve students, under the professional supervision of the State Puppet Theatre. The first shows' puppets were designed by Vera Br√≥dy, and made in the workshop of the State Puppet Theatre by Em≈ëke Szab√≥ applied artist. Scenery were made in the workshop of the National Theatre of MIskolc under the direction of Attila Veres. Accompanying music was composed by composers of Miskolc, music teacher J√°nos Zoller and organist L√°szl√≥ Csabai. The group soon grew out of its original location. In 1988 the theatre company, then being the amateur puppetry of the City Cultural Centre, received a group operational permit from the National Philharmony, then from 1992 the company was granted the license to work as professional theatre, and was relocated to the building of the former Studio Theatre in Kossuth Street, where they established their own workshop. Techniques In the beginning they carried on the traditions of the State Puppet Theatre playing mainly classic puppet shows for young children. In recent years the group's professional activities are characterized by variety of techniques and genres. Amongst others the group put up plays based on Roma genesis legends, but their series featuring traditional European fai puppet-show stories, or the stories of Czechoslovakian cartoons formerly being very popular in Hungary have eventually built up a unique repertoire. Beside hand or glovepuppets they apply several techniques in creating puppets. They make Wayang puppets, and amongst the flat-puppets cut out from paper and installed onto posts, marionettes were used for example in the play, H√°ry J√°nos. Puppets in the King M√°ty√°s tales are moved with a Sicilian marionette technique, while objects transformed into real actors in Rosszcsont Peti (Naughty Peter).

It was acquired by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway in 1901 and the New York Central Railroad several years later. Most of the line has since been abandoned. History In the 1850s, a line was surveyed and partially graded from Cincinnati north to Van Wert, but construction was halted by the Panic of 1857.Morrow, p. 25Weston A. Goodspeed and Charles Blanchard, County of Williams, Ohio: Historical and Biographical, 1882, pp. 219-220 Construction on a north-south line through Ohio's western tier of counties did not begin again until the 1870s. The Van Wert, Paulding and Michigan Railway was incorporated in December 1874 to build a short branch from the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway (at Cecil) to Paulding.Ohio Secretary of State, Annual Report for the year 1875, pp. 198-199 However, the Paulding and Cecil Railway was incorporated for the same purpose in December 1879,Ohio Secretary of State, Annual Report for the year 1880, pp. 140-141 and opened in September 1880. Another short segment of the future Cincinnati Northern was built by the Celina, Van Wert and State Line Extension of the Columbus and North‚ÄìWestern Railway, incorporated in May 1878 for the purpose of building a line from Celina north to the state line in Williams County.Ohio Secretary of State, Annual Report for the year 1878, pp. 122-123 Near the state line it would meet the Columbus and North‚ÄìWestern Railway, which had been incorporated in 1872 to build from Columbus to the state line in that same county,Ohio Secretary of State, Annual Report for the year 1872, pp. 46-47Jacob Henry Studer, Columbus, Ohio: Its History, Resources, and Progress, 1873, p. 531 but was never constructed. The line was built to narrow gauge to connect with the growing Toledo, Delphos and Burlington Railroad (TD&B;), opening from Van Wert south to Ohio City on the TD&B; in August 1879, to the Mercer County line in January 1880, and to Rockford in September 1880, for a total of .Hilton, pp. 462-464 At Rockford, it connected to another TD&B; branch, which had been completed from Delphos in December 1878; the TD&B; finished a line (later part of the main line to Dayton) from that branch at Mercer south to Celina in November 1880. Thus the Celina, Van Wert and State Line had helped to form a line south to Celina, but it ended at Van Wert in the north.Rehor, pp. 122, 127 The Cincinnati, Van Wert and Michigan Railroad (CVW&M;) was incorporated in January 1881 to complete the line, and soon leased the Celina, Van Wert and State Line and Van Wert, Paulding and Michigan. The former was converted to on June 4, 1881,Hilton, p. 464 and the latter built a line that year from Van Wert north to the county line at Scott. The CVW&M; itself, which bought the property of its two lessors later that year, built from Scott north to Paulding and Rockford south to West Manchester before merging with a Michigan corporation, the Jackson and Ohio Railroad (incorporated January 1884), in March 1886, to form the Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railroad (CJ&M;). That company bought the Paulding and Cecil in May 1887, and that year completed the full line from Addison, Michigan south to Carlisle, Ohio.Interstate Commerce Commission, 28 Val. Rep. 607: Valuation Docket No. 919, The Cincinnati Northern Railroad Company (1929) Trackage rights were initially secured over the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad (CH&D;) from Carlisle into Cincinnati in 1888, but the CJ&M; also extended its line from Carlisle to Franklin in 1888,Poor's Manual of the Railroads of the United States, 1889, p. 395 and in January 1896 changed its Cincinnati access to the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Big Four) from Franklin to Middletown, the recently opened Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad to Hageman, and the recently standard-gauged Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway (CL&N;) into Cincinnati.Hauck, pp. 158, 163 The CJ&M; bought a second line from the Michigan and Ohio Railroad in March 1887, stretching from Allegan past the north end of the main line at Addison to Dundee, Michigan. This line, however, was sold at foreclosure to the Toledo and Milwaukee Railroad in 1897, soon after the Jackson and Cincinnati Railway (incorporated 1895, sold 1898) built an extension north to Jackson.Interstate Commerce Commission, 28 Val. Rep. 675: Valuation Docket No. 951, Detroit, Toledo & Milwaukee Railroad Company (1929) The railroad's shops in Van Wert, Ohio, circa 1914. The CJ&M; was not a profitable enterprise, and went through a reorganization in 1892 as the Cincinnati and Michigan Railroad, immediately merging with the Michigan and Mackinaw Railroad (which had acquired the Allegan-Dundee line) to form the Cincinnati, Jackson and Michigan Railway. Throughout this period, the CJ&M; attempted to convince the CH&D; to acquire it by threatening to buy the CL&N; and thus obtain its own line into Cincinnati. But when the CH&D; tried to buy the CJ&M; in the early 1890s, the CL&N; protested and obtained an injunction due to a state law forbidding anti- competitive mergers. The CJ&M; continued to improve its value to a potential purchaser, organizing the Dayton and Cincinnati Terminal Railroad in May 1894 to build a Cincinnati-Dayton line including a long tunnel under Cincinnati's Walnut Hills. Finding that the older Cincinnati Railway Tunnel Company owned such a franchise and an incomplete tunnel, the CJ&M; bought up that company's first-mortgage bonds and forced a foreclosure, acquiring the tunnel in May 1896. The new terminal company was renamed the Cincinnati Northern Railroad in December 1894, and bought the CJ&M; at its final foreclosure in July 1897. The Big Four subsequently acquired the Cincinnati Northern in 1901, and sold the unused tunnel property, as well as about of land it had acquired for a Cincinnati terminal, to the CL&N;, now owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, in 1902.Hauck, pp. 158-167, 171 The Cincinnati Northern was formally merged into the Big Four effective June 30, 1938.Moody's Transportation Manual, 1975, p. 236 Since then, most of the line has been abandoned, with only a few short pieces still in place, mostly operated by short lines: Germantown Rail Siding from Carlisle to Germantown, R.J. Corman Railroad/Western Ohio Lines (which is owned by the R.J. Corman short line railroad company) from Greenville to Ansonia, Chicago, Ft. Wayne and Eastern Railroad at Van Wert, and Norfolk Southern Railway at Jackson, MI and Bryan, OH, and Pioneer Railcorp in Cecil, Ohio.

Shaking a pen while thinking is a common way of fidgeting. Fidgeting is the act of moving about restlessly in a way that is not (socially recognized as) essential to ongoing tasks or events. Fidgeting may involve playing with one's fingers, hair, or personal objects (e.g. glasses, pens or items of clothing). Fidgeting is commonly used as a label for unexplained or subconscious activities and postural movements that people perform while seated. A common act of fidgeting is to bounce one's leg repeatedly. Rings are another common focus of fidgeting; variations include ring spinning, twirling or rolling along a table. Classrooms are sites of fidgeting, and traditionally teachers and students have viewed fidgeting as a sign of diminished attention, which is summarized by the statement, ‚ÄúConcentration of consciousness, and concentration of movements; diffusion of ideas and diffusion of movements go together.‚Äù  Causes and effects  Fidgeting may be a result of nervousness, frustration, agitation, boredom, ADHD, excitement, or a combination of these. When interested in a task, a seated person will suppress their fidgeting, a process described as Non-Instrumental Movement Inhibition. Some education researchers consider fidgeting, along with noise-making, as clear signs of inattention or low lecture quality, although educators point out that active engagement can take place without constantly directing attention to the instructor (i.e. engagement and attention are related but not equivalent ). Fidgeting is often a subconscious act and is increased during spontaneous mind-wandering. Some researchers have proposed that fidgeting is not only an indicator of diminishing attention, but is also a subconscious attempt to increase arousal in order to improve attention. While inattention is strongly associated with poor learning and poor information recall, research by Dr. Karen Pine and colleagues found that children that are allowed to fidget with their hands performed better in memory and learning tests. Fidgeting is considered a nervous habit, though it does have some underlying benefits. People who fidget regularly tend to weigh less than people who do not fidget because they burn more calories than those who remain still, which is called Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT). It has been reported that fidgeting burns about 350 extra calories per day, which could add up to about 10 to 30 pounds a year. Fidgeting may be a result of genetics and some are born with a propensity to be fidgety. Fidgeting can also be a medical sign, as seen in hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroid patients may be restless, become agitated easily, display fine tremors, and have trouble concentrating.  Fidget toys  There are several devices that aim to aid fidgeting, including fidget cubes, fidget spinners, fidget sticks (kururin), and fidget pens. These \\"fidget toys\\" are typically intended to help students with autism or ADHD focus better, and come with a variety of buttons and switches that the user can play with.

The area has a history of political struggle against the Dutch. The vast majority of the Acehnese people are Muslims. The Acehnese people are also referred to by other names such as Lam Muri, Lambri, Akhir, Achin, Asji, A-tse and Atse. Their language, Acehnese, belongs to the Aceh‚ÄìChamic group of Malayo-Polynesian of the Austronesian language family. The Acehnese were at one time Hinduised, as evident from their traditions and the many Sanskrit words in their language. They have been Muslims for several centuries and are generally considered the most conservative Muslim ethnic group in Indonesia with the implementation of Sharia law in their home province of Aceh. The estimated number of Acehnese ranges between 3,526,000 people and at least 4.2 million people Traditionally, there have been many Acehnese agriculturists, metal-workers and weavers. Traditionally matrilocal, their social organisation is communal. They live in gamp√¥ngs, which combine to form districts known as mukims. The golden era of Acehnese culture began in the 16th century, along with the rise of the Islamic Aceh Sultanate and later reaching its peak in the 17th century. Generally, the Acehnese people are regarded as strict adherents to the Islamic faith and also as militant fighters against the colonial conquest of the Portuguese Empire and the Dutch Empire. Aceh came to international attention as being the hardest-hit region of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake with 120,000 people dead. Origins An Acehnese couple is seen with the man girded with a Rencong knife, circa 1939. Archaeological evidence of the earliest inhabitants of Aceh are from the Pleistocene age, where they lived in the west coast of Aceh (Langsa and Aceh Tamiang Regency region) and they exhibited Australomelanesoid characteristics. They mainly lived from seafood, especially various types of shellfish, as well as land animals such as pigs and rhinoceros. They had already used fire and buried bodies with certain rituals. The migration of the indigenous tribes, the Mantir people and the Lhan people (Proto-Malay), as well as the Chams, Malays and Minangkabau people (Deutero- Malay) who arrived later, formed the pribumi dwellers of Aceh. Foreign ethnicity, especially Indians, as well as a small part of Arabs, Persians, Turks and Portuguese are also components of the Acehese people. The strategic position of Aceh in the northern tip of the Sumatra island for thousands of years has become a haven and inter-marriage of various people group, namely those that are in the sea trade route from the Middle East to China. =Native Southeast Asian peoples= Anonymous 1540 Portuguese illustration from the C√≥dice Casanatense, depicting Acehnese. The inscription reads: \\"People that inhabit the island of Sumatra called Acehnese, they are gentiles, very warlike people who fight with blowguns with which they shoot small poisoned arrows; from this island of Sumatra hails sandalwood, benzoin, and much gold and silver, it is a very rich island.\\" Chinese and Indian sources from 500 CE and onward mention that there was a settlement in northernmost Sumatra (Aceh) which was called P'o-lu. Many scholars believe that P'o-lu was close to the what is now Banda Aceh. These sources also state that the average person wore cotton clothing while the ruling elite wore silk. The Chinese annals also claim that the local people were Buddhist. Acehnese folklore has it that the earliest people of Aceh came from the indigenous tribes such as the Mante people and the Lhan people. The Mante people is a local native people group allegedly related to the Batak, Gayonese and Alas people, while the Lhan people is allegedly still related to the Semang people group who have migrated from the Malay Peninsula or the Indochina (Champa and Burma). Initially, the Mante people settled in Aceh Besar Regency and later began to spread to other regions. Around the ninth and tenth century there was an influx of Arabic and Persian merchants to the Aceh region. When Marco Polo visited the area in 1292, he mentions that some of the port cities and towns had already converted to Islam. It's commonly thought that when the Samudera Pasai Sultanate was founded, Islam was fully established in the region. Nonetheless, it's clear that Islam was a major religion in and around Aceh by the thirteenth century. During the decline of the Srivijaya kingdom, it is estimated that a number of Malay people began to migrate to Aceh. They then settled down in the valleys of Tamiang River and later became known as the Tamiang people. After they were conquered by the Samudera Pasai Sultanate kingdom (1330), only then did they begin to integrate into Acehnese society; although in terms of cultural and linguistic, there are still similarities with the Malay culture. By the sixteenth century, Aceh was an important cultural and scholastic Islamic center influential throughout much of Southeast Asia. Most of the Minangkabau people who migrated to Aceh settled around Meulaboh and Krueng Seunagan valley. Generally in these fertile areas they manage wet paddy fields and pepper farming, as well as some trading. The mixed population of Acehnese- Minangkabau people is also found in the southern region, namely in the areas around Susoh, Tapaktuan and Labuhan Haji. There are many who converse daily in both Acehnese language and their own native dialect, the Aneuk Jamee language. As a result of the political expansion and diplomatic relations of the Aceh Sultanate with their surrounding region, the Acehnese people were also mixed with the Alas people, Gayonese, Karo people, Nias people and Kluet people. The unification of the Acehnese culture that stemmed from various ancestry are primarily in the Acehnese language, religion of Islam and the local customs, as how it was formulated by Sultan Iskandar Muda in the Adat Makuta Alamlaws, which is well known as \\"Kanun Mahkota Alam\\". =India= There are many of those who are of Indian descent in Aceh, which are closely linked to trading and the spreading of Hinduism-Buddhism and Islam in Aceh. Those who are of Indian descent are mainly Tamils and Gujarati people which are found spread throughout the entire Aceh. Among some of the Indian people's influence on the Acehnese people includes the cultural aspects and physical attributes of part of the Acehnese people, as well as the variety in Acehnese cuisine that frequently utilizes curry. Numerous place name of Sanskrit origin (for example, Indrapuri, Aceh Besar) reflects the cultural heritage of Hinduism in the past. =Arab, Persia and Turkey= > \\"The tribe of the Three Hundred is (insignificant) as the seeds of the drang > (a bush which grows like a weed along fences); > The people of the clan Ja Sandang are even as anise and cummin (thus a > little more valuable). > Those of the Ja Bat√®√´ (count) for something; > The Imeum Peu√´t it is which makes the world to tremble.\\" > > ‚Äî Oral poem (hadih maja) from > Snouck Hurgronje's De Atjeher'. Most of the Arabs that migrated to Aceh came from Hadhramaut, Yemen. Among the immigrants are those of the al-Aydrus, al-Habsyi, al-Attas, al-Kathiri, Badjubier, Sungkar, Bawazier and other clans; all of which are Arabic clans that originated from Yemen. They came as ulamas to spread Islam and as traders. Seunagan district for an instance, is well known to this today for numerous of ulamas of the Sayyid descent, of which the local community would address them with the title Teungku Jet or Habib as a form of respect. Similarly, some of the Sultan of Aceh are also descendants of Sayyid. Many of their descendants today have intermarried with the natives Acehnese people and do no longer bear their clan names. There are also those of Persian descent that generally came to spread religion and to trade, while those of Turkish descent generally were invited as ulamas, weapon merchants, military trainers and soldiers of war for the Aceh Sultanate. At present, people of Persian and Turkish descent in Indonesia are mostly scattered in Aceh Besar Regency. Names of Persian and Turkish heritage are still being used by Acehnese people to name their children. In fact, the word Banda in the name of Banda Aceh city is also a word of Persian language in origin (Banda means \\"port\\"). =Portugal= People of Portuguese descent are found mainly in Kuala Daya administrative division, Lam No (west coast of Aceh). Portuguese sailors under the lieutenant leadership of Captain Pinto, were sailing towards Malacca, stopped by on Lam No and traded there; where some of them remained and settled there. History records that this event occurred between 1492 and 1511; of which at that time Lam No was under the rule of a small kingdom called, Lam No with King Meureuhom Daya as their ruler. Till this day, some of their descendants can still be seen with European features. Language Regencies area of which the Acehnese language is spoken in Aceh.247x247px Speakers of Acehnese, recorded for Wikitongues. Acehnese language falls under the Aceh‚ÄìChamic languages category, a branch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages from the Austronesian languages. Languages that are closely related with the Acehnese language are Cham language, Roglai language, Jarai language, Rade language, Chru language, Tsat language, as well as other Chamic languages that are spoken in Cambodia, Vietnam and Hainan. There are also loan words from Mon- Khmer languages which indicates that there are possibilities that the forebears of the Acehnese people might have lived in the Malay peninsula or Southern Thailand that borders with the Mon-Khmer speakers before migrating to Sumatra. Vocabulary of the Acehnese language have been enriched by absorption from Sanskrit and Arabic language, especially in the field of religion, laws, governance, warfare, arts and knowledge. For centuries, the Acehnese language have also absorbed a lot from the Malay language. Malay language and Minangkabau language are related to the subsequent Aceh‚ÄìChamic languages; which falls together under the same category of Western Malayo-Polynesian languages. Initially a group of Chamic languages migrant speakers were thought to have controlled a small region only, namely Banda Aceh in Aceh Besar Regency. Marco Polo (1292) states that Aceh at that time consists of 8 smaller kingdoms, with each of them possessing their own language. The expansion of power on other coastal kingdoms, especially Pidie, Pasai and Daya, and absorption of their population over time in a period of 400 years, eventually made the language of the Banda Aceh population became dominant in the coastal region of Aceh. Other native languages speakers were then forced into the interior by the expansion of land for farming by the Acehnese language speakers. Heads of Aceh at Singapore.

Sitting at the right: Strabander of Atjeh Dialects of the Acehnese language that are found in the Aceh Besar Regency valley are divided into two major groups, namely the Tunong dialect for dialects in the highlands and Baroh dialect for dialects in the lowlands. Most of the dialects that are used in Aceh Besar Regency and Daya, shows that settlements in that region have existed longer than any other regions. There are also many dialects in Pidie Regency, although not as much as in Aceh Besar Regency and Daya. Dialects on the east coast of Pidie Regency and in southern Daya tend to be more homogeneous, so much so that it is co-related with the migration that came along with the expansion of power of the Aceh Sultanate after the 1500s. Local government of Aceh, among others through Governor's Decree No. 430/543/1986 and Perda No. 2 of 1990 established the Institute of Acehnese Customary and Culture (Lembaga Adat dan Kebudayaan Aceh, LAKA), with the mandate to develop the customs and norms of the communities and customary institutions in Aceh. Indirectly, this institution protects the preservation of the Acehnese language because in every cultural and customary activity, the delivery of such activities is carried out in the Acehnese language. Likewise, the Acehnese language is also commonly used in everyday affairs that are organized by government agencies in Aceh. Culture = Dances = Seudati dance performed at Samalanga, Bireun, Aceh, 1907. Traditional Acehnese dance portrays the heritage culture, religion and folklore of the common folk. Acehnese dance are generally performed in groups, either in a standing or sitting position, and the group of dancers are of the same gender. If seen from the musical standpoint, the dance can be grouped into two types. One is accompanied with vocals and physical percussive movements of the dancers themselves, and the other is simply accompanied by an assemble of musical instruments. * Laweut * Likok Pulo * Pho (dance) * Rabbani Wahed * Ranup lam Puan * Rapa'i Geleng * Rateb Meuseukat * Ratoh Duek * Seudati * Tarek Pukat * Saman =Traditional cuisine= Mie Aceh, Acehnese fried noodles Acehnese cuisine is known for its combination of spices just as are commonly found in Indian and Arabic cuisine, such as ginger, pepper, coriander, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom and fennel. A variety of Acehnese food is cooked with curry or curry and coconut milk, which is generally combined with meat such as buffalo, beef, mutton, fish, or chicken. Several types of traditional recipe use a blend of cannabis as a flavoring spice; such cases are also found in the cuisine of some other Southeast Asian countries, such as Laos.

The discovery of the Longshan culture at Chengziya was a significant step towards understanding the origins of Chinese civilization. Chengziya remains the largest prehistorical settlement found to date.Alfred Schinz (1996): \\"The Magic Square: Cities in Ancient China\\", Edition Axel Menges The site is located in Shandong province, about to the east of the provincial capital Jinan. It is protected and made accessible by the Chengziya Ruins Museum (). Location Chengziya is located about west of Longshan Town () under the administration of Zhangqiu City and about east of the provincial capital of Jinan. The site is located immediately to the north of provincial road S102 and less than to the south of the Dragon Lake. Other landmarks in the area are Dongping Mausoleum (less than to the east) and the ruins of the old city wall. Neolithic settlement Building protecting the excavation site The ancient settlement of Chengziya was constructed around 2600 BCKwang-chih Chang, Pingfang Xu, Liancheng Lu, Sarah Allan (2005): \\"The Formation of Chinese Civilization: An Archaeological Perspective\\", Yale University Press and was located on a tableland near the old Guanlu and Wuyuan rivers.\\"Chengziya Ruins Museum\\" by the Jinan Municipal Government The name Chengziya, literally \\"city cliff\\" refers to this location and the wall that encloses the settlement. The Wuyan River flows in the north-south direction to the west of the settlement. The Chengziya settlement had rectangular layout (400 by 500 meters, 1300 by 1600 feet) with edges oriented along the north-south and east-west directions. While the western, southern, and eastern walls are straight, the northern wall juts outward following the terrain. The settlement hence covered an area of about 200,000 square meters and was enclosed by a hangtu (rammed earth) wall that stood about tall, was wide at the base and tapered off to a width at the top.\\"Chengziya\\" by About.com The technique for erecting the walls from pounded earth was a new innovation at the time. Successive layers ranging between 12 and in thickness were each compacted before the next layer was added. On the outside of the walls was a deep moat that was fed by water from a nearby river. As there are no major walls inside the settlement, the layout conforms to the style of a \\"platform city\\" (). Chenziya is at the center of a cluster of more than 40 sites belonging to the Longshan Culture. These sites come in three size classes: sites covering from a few thousand up to 10,000 square meters are thought to belong to the ju () referred to in ancient documents. Larger sites up to 50,000 square meters are believed to be yi (central towns) and finally Chengziya itself has been identified as a du (, capital). Based on thick deposits found at the site (from 3-4 up to 5-6 meters deep), the population of the Chengziya has been estimated to be in the tens of thousands. Other settlements After the decline of the Longshan culture, the Chengziya site was occupied by two more walled settlements. One belonging to the Yueshi culture 1900-1500 BC) and the other dated to the time of the Zhou dynasty (1100-256 BC). Archaeological study Ancient city wall The site was discovered in 1928 by the archaeologist Wu Jinding (, 1901-1948)biography of Wu Jinding (in Chinese) It was the first discovery of relics from the Longshan Culture which was named for the nearby Longshan (, literally \\"Dragon Hill\\") and the village of the same name. The first excavations on the site were carried out in the years 1930 and 1931. This was the first time that such field research was carried out exclusively by Chinese archaeologists using modern methods. Additional excavations were carried out in 1990 by the Archaeological Institute of Shandong Province on the southern side of the provincial road. Excavations at the site have unearthed the foundations of houses, pottery kilns and wells as well as pottery items (e.g., tripod cauldrons, cups, jars), stone tools, oracle bones, and weapons. Characteristic items found at the site include fine black polished pottery, in particular wheel-turned vessels with an angular outline, abundant gray pottery, as well as rectangular polished stone axes.Longshan culture. (2008). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved October 31, 2008, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Some of the pottery found features inscriptions. The objects found inside the Chengziya settlement were in general of higher quality than those of the surrounding areas, which is taken as an indication that Chengziya as a regional capital received tribute from the surrounding smaller settlements. Chengzija is one of the few neolithic sites at which horse bones have been found. However, the recovered material does not allow it to be determined whether horses had already been domesticated at the time. Museum Entrance building to the museum The Chengziya Ruins Museum is located 100 m to the east of the neolithic settlement. It covers an area of 20,000 square meters of which 4,000 square meters are occupied by the main building. The museum building was designed by Yang Hongxun, an expert on historical buildings. The building is shaped like a mythical bird with the wings containing the exhibition halls and the body conference facilities. The museum was opened in September 1994, the total construction cost was 6 million Chinese Yuan. The museum complex also houses the Jinan Longshan Culture Research Institute. Since its opening, the museum has received more than 500,000 visitors. Political significance The remains of the Longshan Culture at Chengziya are cultivated by the government as a source of national pride in the long history of Chinese civilization. The Chengziya site was among the first historical and cultural sites to be placed under government protection in 1961 (State Council resolution number 1-140).\\"Chengziya Relics Museum\\" by the Jinan Tourism Administration Furthermore, it has since been declared a first-tier \\"patriotism education\\" site by the municipal and provincial government. Its political importance has been stressed by visits of political leaders.

The Mission style movie theater initially had a stage for theatrical productions which was removed in 1936. The theater closed in 1957 and became a part of the adjoining Manning home. The theater has since been restored and is used as a community theater. The theatre is significant for its architecture and its association with Manning, a prominent Montana legislator. Description The theatre is a two-story Mission style building, built of stucco-clad brick. The front facade faces south and features two buttressed towers at the corners flanking the main entrance. The entry and octagonal ticket booth are inset between the towers under a railed balcony. The front and sides are detailed with projecting vigas. The towers are subdivided into four piers each, with a domed cap. The theater's interior was originally entirely used by the auditorium space, but in 1936-37 the stage was altered to become living space for the owner's family. In 1950 these spaces were expanded with one-story additions. The living quarters were expanded again in 1974, shortening the main house. The auditorium has a small balcony under the projection booth. History The theatre was built by David M. Manning in 1931 during a period of economic expansion in Hysham. Manning was born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin on February 28, 1897, and arrived with his family in Hysham in 1910. Manning was a contractor and served as a state legislator until 1985, holding most of the senior positions in the Montana House of Representatives and Senate. The Mannings operated the theatrer as a cinema until the 1960s. In 1992 the building became part of the Treasure County Museum, whose main facility is located across the street. The theater is used for community movie shows and plays. The Yucca Theatre was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 7, 1994.

He has been recording professionally for 15 years, and has played as a session musician and recorded with most of the renowned Pakistani mainstream artists including Ali Haider, Najam Shiraz, Zeb and Haniya, Hadiqa Kiyani, and Strings. In 2003 Xavier, with Imran Momina formed the internationally acclaimed band Fuz√∂n. Shallum is currently working on his own album which features various artists from across borders. Xavier had been awarded Best Guitarist of Pakistan 2 years running, as well as an award for Best South Asian Band and Best Composer for his composition of Khamajhttp://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_27-7-2004_pg7_15. He has collaborated independently with Ingrid Kindem, Hildegun and Mocci (Fryd), and has performed with them on a number of occasions in both Pakistan and Norway. Biography Born in Karachi, Pakistan, in 1978 to Samuel and Shirin Xavier, Shallum is the second of four siblings, and the oldest son. He grew up around music and musicians, and began experimenting on the keyboard when he was eight. Inspired by the American pastor at his Sunday school who played the guitar, Xavier knew he wanted to play live music, and began to teach himself. =Start of Career= Adopting Steve Vai and Joe Satriani as his mentors, the switch to guitar was complete. Xavier saved up his allowance, and bought his first acoustic guitar for Rs. 1000 from a chappati wala (roadside flatbread vendor) who had an after hours job at a guitar manufacturing workshop. He used this guitar for 3 years, bruising and cutting himself on the low-grade quality. He then sought out a musician who would teach him the basics of guitar and musical theory. Roland lived across the street from Xavier and started teaching him. Xavier would also trek over by bus to a place near the commercial hub of Karachi where there would be rejected publications, and buy guitar player magazines- the only source for information on music available at the time. Xavier did not have many friends, so when he discovered one other person in his neighborhood, Ovais, who was apart from the rest like himself, he found someone equally involved and determined about learning as much as possible about music and musicians internationally. Before long, some of Xavier's school friends from Saint Paul's English High School also started learning various instruments, and when Xavier was 14, they formed a band. They would practice day and night, often for twelve hours at a stretch. As for Xavier, this was when he started focusing exclusively on who and what he wanted to be. = Breaking the silence = Xavier would spend his evenings isolated in the veranda outside the kitchen, and, in the backdrop of the noisy Karachi streets and the pleasant shouts of children playing cricket, used to practice for hours. Naturally reserved, in pursuit of learning and perfecting his craft he forced himself out of his shell. He would listen to music, seek out musicians, and make an effort to talk to other guitarists. Karachi had a significant underground music culture. Television's scope was limited at the time, and consequently there was quality live music being performed at restaurants and other public places. Serious musicians were accessible to Xavier, and he made sure to take every advantage to network and learn from them. From the first few chords Xavier learned, he started composing melodies of his own. He would compose songs, and always knew he would write his own music, but realized he would have to know the industry first. =Under pressure= As Xavier became more and more consumed by his music, the pressure mounted on him to choose a career. Music was not considered to be an actual career path, especially for the oldest son. The way forward to an economically stable future was seen to be in quality education, not talent and drive in the arts. For Xavier to give up his music would have been giving up a piece of himself. Pressure from family forces you to make difficult decisions, and Xavier stuck to what he believed in. He knew that one day he would be doing what he's doing now. There was nothing else for him. And so, while he completed his Bachelor of Commerce at Government National College Karachi, Xavier decided that he had to learn the business of music. = The commerce of chords = At 16 Xavier met Imran Momina, better known as Immu, who would remain an integral part of his music career. Immu, who was older, knew many professional musicians at the time. Xavier spent increasing amounts of time with them, learning about the business side of the music industry to counter the pressure at home. The music industry was growing in leaps and bounds in the mid-1990s. There had been a significant gap in the popular music industry post Vital Signs, and as Junoon came in to fill that gap it was an exciting new time for musicians. While that time was exciting for musicians creatively, it was professionally difficult because of the political situation. Post Zia ul-Haq, artistic expression was publicly just starting out again after over a decade of forced silence,http://www.humayusuf.com.pk/pdfs/Features/The%20Birth%20Of%20Cool.pdf and Karachi was suffering from severe violent outbursts frequently. Even Junoon had trouble for their first 6 years or so. Already well connected in the music industry, Immu not only introduced Xavier to musicians, but also a lot of producers. Xavier began working at Hill Music Station, run by Mohsin Raza Khan, better known as ‚ÄúBunny,‚Äù which is when Xavier began seriously experimenting and planning. He used to spend days and nights at a time learning, practicing and jamming. People started liking his music, and Xavier started getting some sessions to play. Creative, spontaneous, quick to deliver, and naturally gifted, session music was not as difficult for Xavier as it could have been, and it gave him the courage and energy to move forward professionally and creatively. Xavier played in almost every studio that existed at the time, and played sessions for all the musicians in the industry, including Strings, Najam Shiraz, Ali Haider, and Hadiqa Kayyani, and performed at Caf√© Blue and New York Caf√©. The youngest among the musicians he was spending time with, Xavier had his first studio experience at the age of 16, recording an album in 2 days. Making music for other people was a way to make money to support themselves, but it was just a break-even situation financially.

It belonged to the early part of the 1989-1996 period, a period when gambling-themed films were dominating the Hong Kong movie scene. The film was followed by two sequels No Risk, No Gain (1990) and Casino Raiders II (1991), which have unrelated plots. Plot Crab Chan (Andy Lau) and Sam Law (Alan Tam) are a pair of renowned professional gamblers who are best friends. One day, a tycoon named Lung (Charles Heung) summons the two of them to his casino in Lake Tahoe to crack a scam led by a pair of Japanese gamblers, Kung (Hagiwara Kenzo) and his son Taro (Lung Fong). There, Crab and Sam also meet Koyan Tong (Idy Chan), a rich heiress from Hong Kong who is on vacation in the United States. Koyan and Sam also develop a relationship. After the three of them return to Hong Kong, Sam is being hunted down by triads who were sent by Kung to seek revenge. Fortunately, Sam is rescued by Crab. However, this led to Crab severely injuring his left hand, which affected his gambling skills. Koyan introduces her father to Sam, who is arranged to work in his future father in-law's company. There, Sam also ruins the Kungs' plan to scheme money from his father in-law, and thus, Kung hires more killers to kill Sam, and this time, he becomes injured and hospitalized. Sam's father in-law demands him to give up gambling which Sam promised to do. At Sam and Koyan's engagement, Crab brings his girlfriend Bo Bo (Rosamund Kwan) to congratulate the two while also finding out that Sam had decided to go straight. Sam wanted Crab to come help him in the company or lend money to start some decent business. Crab rejects these offers, citing that his English is not as good as Sam's, while in actuality, Crab did not want to give up gambling. One day, Crab goes to a casino and sees Taro, since the casino was owned by him. Taro wanted to gamble with Crab with a bet of HK$3 million, but the police unexpectedly break in. Although they were not prosecuted since Taro has thrown his stake outside, it was revealed that most of Crab's stakes were counterfeit bills and Taro felt offended. Taro retaliates by kidnapping Koyan and demands Crab to rescue her. At this time, Sam is doing business with his father in-law in Australia, so Crab temporarily abandons his plan to immigrate to Brazil with Bo Bo and goes to confront Taro. Not only did Taro insult and rape Koyan, he also shot and killed Bo Bo, who came to back up Crab before a fight between Crab and Taro's henchmen ensued. In order to rescue Koyan, Crab was forced to drink a glass of poisoned wine. While Koyan arrived home safely, Crab and Bo Bo had sacrificed their lives. After Sam returns to Hong Kong, he is determined to seek vengeance for Crab. Sam seeks help from Lung and other American casino owners. The Americans also use this as a chance to compete with the Japanese for the interests of casinos in Asia, which created heavy gang warfare. They eventually agree to hold a poker game with Taro representing Japan and Sam representing America. Koyan also brings over HK$1 billion of asset certificates to support Sam. During the intermission of the final round of the poker game, Sam is attacked by a hitman in the restroom. The injured Sam entrusts Koyan to take his place for the final bet. He tells her to bet his entire stake, and since Taro would not have a sufficient stake, he also bets his hand and foot to even it out. Koyan requests this at the gambling table and Taro agrees to it, but Koyan has to bet her hand as well to make the bet fair. During the game, Koyan's hand shows the ten of hearts, the jack of hearts, the king of hearts and the ace of hearts, while Taro's hand shows two queens and two jacks. In the end, Koyan wins with a straight flush. Taro had to keep his promise, but did not want to cut off his hand and foot, so he shot and killed his father and other audience members before being shot dead by both the Americans and Japanese. Koyan then goes to see Sam at the hospital where she overhears a conversation between Sam and the hitman that pretended to kill him. It was revealed that the attack in the bathroom was staged by Sam himself in order to have Taro agree to bet his hand and foot and expect to have the Kungs kill each other, achieving his ultimate goal of seeking vengeance for Crab. Sam also says he does not intend to let Koyan know about this secret and instead, he would conceal it forever. After hearing this, Koyan removes her engagement ring, leaves it on the floor outside Sam's room, and brokenheartedly leaves.

It reaches an elevation of above sea level at the √áuka e Partizanit, which is the highest peak in central Albania. Mount Tomorr is one of Albania's biggest water-collecting areas. Tomorr is situated within the Tomorr National Park, which is noted for its diverse species of deciduous and coniferous trees and a great variety of flora. Many endangered species are free to roam and live in this area such as bears (Ursus arctos), wolf (Canis lupus), and birds of prey. Tomorr is a holy mountain for Albanians, and it is a site where annual pilgrimages take place during the second half of August.; . Along with St. Anthony's Catholic Church in La√ß, Mount Tomorr is the most frequented sacred place in Albania. Mount Tomorr offers various sports such as hiking, horse or donkey riding, canoeing, and skiing.  Etymology  The Albanian Tomor(r) derives from the Illyrian T√≥maros, from Proto-Indo-European *t√≥mhxes-, \\"dark\\", akin to Latin tenebrae \\"darkness\\", temere \\"blindly, by chance\\", Old Irish temel \\"darkness\\", Middle Irish teimen \\"dark grey\\", Old High German demar \\"darkness\\", dinstar \\"dark\\", Old Church Slavonic t«êma \\"darkness\\", t«êm«ên«î \\"dark\\". History Illyrians called the mountain T√≥maros. It was the most prominent mountain in southern Illyria. The mountain has been connected by modern scholars to Mount Amyron (), recorded by Stephanus of Byzantium (6th century AD) citing Hecataeus of Miletus (6th century BC). In the passage, it is reported that the Dexaroi, a Chaonian tribe, dwelled under this mountain.Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica: \\"ŒîŒ≠ŒæŒ±œÅŒøŒπ, ·ºîŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÇ ŒßŒ±œåŒΩœâŒΩ, œÑŒø·øñœÇ ·ºòŒ≥œáŒµŒªŒ≠Œ±ŒπœÇ œÄœÅŒøœÉŒµœáŒµ·øñœÇ, ·ºôŒ∫Œ±œÑŒ±·øñŒøœÇ Œï·ΩêœÅœéœÄ·øÉ. ·ΩëœÄ·Ω∏ ·ºåŒºœÖœÅŒøŒΩ ·ΩÑœÅŒøœÇ Œø·º∞Œ∫Œø·ø¶ŒΩ.\\"; . The mountain was probably located in a region that in Roman times was called Dassaretis.; . Vibius Sequester (4th or 5th century AD) records the mountain with the name Tomarus, and locates it in the Roman province of Macedonia, near Apollonia.Vibius Sequester, De fluminibus, fontibus, lacubus, nemoribus, gentibus, quorum apud po√´tas mentio fit. \\"Montes\\", \\"314 Tomarus, Macedoniae, proximus Apolloniae in conspectu Dyrrachi\\". During the reign of Byzantine Emperor Basil II, the sons of Bulgarian Tsar Ivad Vladislav fled in Tomorr to continue the war against the Byzantines after the collapse of First Bulgarian Empire in 1018, but soon surrendered as they reached an agreement and received great privileges. The last Bulgarian governor of Berat was an Elimagos. The 13th century was a series of changes in the region. Manfred of Sicily and then Angevine Albania after 1271-2 held control of the area. The fortress of Tomorr in the early 14th century is attested as Timoro(n) under Byzantine control. In 1337, the Albanian tribes which lived in the areas of Belegrita (the region of Mt. Tomorr) and Kanina rose in rebellion, invaded the area, and raided the fortress. There is little detail about the rebellion in primary sources. John VI Kantakouzenos mentions that the Albanians in those areas rebelled despite the privileges which Andronikos III Palaiologos had given them a few years earlier. These events marked the movement of these Albanian tribes into Epirus for the first time. Andronikos led an army mainly composed of Turkish mercenaries, and defeated the Albanians, killing many and taking prisoners. Shrine at the top of the southern peak of Tomorr. The particularities, beauty and sacredness of Mount Tomorr have been documented since the 17th century. Holy haunts were associated with certain orders of Islamic mysticism helping their expansion into the region. In the early 1880s, when the Bektashi Order was still growing, the movement took on a decisive Albanian nationalist character. The edifice at the top of the southern peak of Tomorr‚Äîa small round twelve-sided shrine encircled by a stone wall‚Äîis said to have been built or rebuilt during these years.; . Bektashis associated the shrine with the second tomb (t√ºrbe/tyrbe) of the legendary figure of Abbas ibn Ali (Albanian: Abaz Ali). Unverified sources claim that his mausoleum existed on Mount Tomorr since the 17th century.; ; . In 1908-1909 a two-room stone dervishia was built some hundred metres below the tyrbe, but in the spring of 1914 it was burned by Greek forces. A new tekke (Albanian: teqe/teqja) was founded and built in 1916 on the Kulmaku Mountain by Dervish Iljaz V√´rzhezha, on the southeastern part of the Tomorr range, just below the old dervishia.; . Acoording to the Albanian Bektashis of the early 20th century the tekke was built on the site of an ancient pagan temple. Mount Tomorr certainly seems to have been the site of a pre-Christian cult and to have been worshiped by the locals, both Christians and Muslims, as a mountain with a supernatural force‚Äîswearing solemn oaths \\"By Him of Tomorr\\" and \\"By the Holy One of Tomorr\\", and practicing ritual sacrifices of animals‚Äîlong before the shrine of Abbas Ali was correlated with the sacred site.; ; ; ; . There is also the oral tradition about the existence of the Curch of Saint Marie there, however the site lacks concrete evidence of any ancient pre-Muslim shrine. Tyrbe on top of the southern peak of Tomorr. The shrine is included in the List of Cultural Monuments of Albania. The first head of the tekke seems to have been Baba Haxhi. In the period between 1921 and 1925 the tekke was headed by Baba Ali Tomorri. Around 1930 about five dervishes were living in the structure. Informations about the tekke during the communist period are scanty. After the communist dictatorship abolished religion in 1967, the pilgrimages stopped until the end of the regime. Under the pretext that the armed forces needed the mountain peak as a strategic military place, both the tyrbe and tekke were destroyed in 1967. After the fall of communism, the tekke was reconstructed in 1992, and the tyrbe in 2008. The tekke is presently headed by Baba Shaban. The number of participants in pilgrimages continues to grow every year. Cult and pilgrimage Mount Tomorr is a sacred site to both Christians, who climb it on Assumption Day (August 15) to honor the Virgin Mary, and the Bektashi, who honor Abbas ibn Ali during an annual pilgrimage on August 20‚Äì25.. The cult of Mount Tomorr can be found in the Rilindja period of Albanian literature where authors such as Konstantin Kristoforidhi, Naim bey Frash√´ri, Andon Zako √áajupi, Asdreni, Hil√´ Mosi, and Ndre Mjeda devoted their works of prose and poetry to Father Tomor. Legend Tomorrica river in front. In Albanian folklore, Mount Tomorr is considered the home of the deities. Morover, it is anthropomorphized and considered a deity itself, envisioned in the legendary figure of Baba Tomor, an old giant with a long flowing white beard and four female eagles hovering above him and perching on his snow-covered slopes. According to German folklorist Maximilian Lambertz, Baba Tomor is the remnant of an Illyrian deity. { align=center  Tomorr  210px  Osum river and Tomorr in the backgroundthumb232px }  See also  * Tomorr National Park * Tomornitsa * Geography of Albania * Mountains of Albania Sources =Citations= =Bibliography=       Category:Mount Tomorr Category:Two-thousanders of Albania Category:Geography of Berat County Category:Tourist attractions in Berat County ","title":"Tomorr"},{"id":"19999327","text":"Corpach () is a large village north of Fort William, in the Scottish Highlands.

It is used topically (as eye drops) to control the progression of open-angle glaucoma and in the management of ocular hypertension, alone or in combination with other medication. It reduces intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes. Adverse effects The most common side effect is conjunctival hyperemia, which occurs in 4 to 20% of patients. Less common side effects include stinging of the eyes, headache, and respiratory infections. Rare side effects are dyspnoea (breathing difficulties), worsening of asthma, and macular oedema.  Interactions  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can either reduce or increase the effect of tafluprost. Timolol eye drops, a common kind of glaucoma medication, does not negatively interact with this drug. No interactions with systemic (for example, oral) drugs are expected because tafluprost does not reach relevant concentrations in the bloodstream. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Tafluprost is a prodrug of the active substance, tafluprost acid, a structural and functional analogue of prostaglandin F2Œ± (PGF2Œ±). Tafluprost acid is a selective agonist at the prostaglandin F receptor, increasing outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes and thus lowering intraocular pressure. Other PGF2Œ± analogues with the same mechanism include latanoprost and travoprost. =Pharmacokinetics= Tafluprost, as a lipophilic ester, easily penetrates the cornea and is then activated to the carboxylic acid, tafluprost acid. Onset of action is 2 to 4 hours after application, the maximal effect is reached after 12 hours, and ocular pressure remains lowered for at least 24 hours. Tafluprost acid is inactivated by beta oxidation to 1,2-dinortafluprost acid, 1,2,3,4-tetranortafluprost acid, and its lactone, which are subsequently glucuronidated or hydroxylated. The cytochrome P450 liver enzymes play no role in the metabolism. An analogous pathway (at least up to the tetranor- metabolites) has been found for latanoprost and travoprost. Metabolism.

His collection has been housed in the National Library of Australia since 1973. https://www.nla.gov.au/selected- library-collections/warren-fahey-collection As a performer he has been telling Australian folk stories, reciting bush poetry and singing either solo or with his ensembles The Larrikins, The Celebrated Knickers & Knockers Band, and, more recently, the Australian Bush Orchestra.

He has performed in numerous countries, mostly with his ensemble, The Larrikins. In 2008, he took his group to Malaysia for Austrade and, in January 2009, to the Philippines for a DFAT cultural tour. Warren sings and plays the concertina. He continues to ‚Äòrevive‚Äô old songs by marrying them with either traditional or new musical settings. Despite this, he owns the rights to the well-known children's \\"Kookaburra song\\" through his company Larrikin records, and in a high-profile case that began in 2009, sued the group Men at Work for using its melody in 5 bars of their 93-bar song \\"Down Under.\\" Men at Work frontman Colin Hay believes the well-publicized case led to the untimely deaths of his father Jim in 2010, and the group's flutist George Ham in 2012. Fahey writes songs where there are no songs to tell an aspect of the Australian story. In 2010, he devised, scripted, recorded and co-produced (with visual artist Mic Gruchy) a major multi-screen art installation commissioned by the Biennale of Sydney titled 'Damned Souls and Turning Wheels' - a history of Cockatoo Island. His Australian Folklore Unit has been collecting and annotating Australian folklore for nearly 50 years and made available in his books, radio programs, concerts and, most importantly, on his website. \\"http://www.warrenfahey.com.au\\" In 2012, he was Artistic Producer for the Kings Cross Festival. In 2013, Rebel Studios completed a one-hour bio documentary on his work titled 'Larrikin Lad' which was screened several times on SBS 'Studio' and released as a DVD by ABC Video. The documentary was selected to be screened on Qantas for four months of 2014. 2014 saw Warren return to collaborating with video artist Mic Grouchy to devise and create a series of films on the history of Rookwood Cemetery (for the Rookwood Trust). One film told the story of Rookwood as the Southern Hemisphere's largest surviving Victorian necropolis and four told the story of notable interments Roy Rene, David Jones & Anthony Hordern, Mai Quong Tart and newspaper baron John Fairfax. In 2015 additional heritage films were made on Rookwood's ANZAC connections, Louisa Lawson, Peter Dawson. In addition, Warren produced public events including Tales of Valour (commemoration WW1) and the 2015 Remembrance Day. In 2017 two more films were commissioned by Rookwood to commemorate the necropolis 150th anniversary - one general script titled 'The Sleeping City' and the other on the Mortuary Railway.http://www.rgct.com.au As a features writer Warren Fahey continues to contribute to numerous newspapers and magazines including a stint as a lifestyle writer for Harper's Bazaar, Australian stringer for Conde Nast Traveler USA, Vogue Entertaining and Travel, The Bulletin Magazine, Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, Rhythms and various specialist magazines.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service.  History  The prison is named after Swinfen Hall, which stands opposite the prison. HMP Swinfen Hall opened in February 1963 as a Borstal. In 1972 it became a long-term young offenders' institution. In April 2001, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons highly praised Swinfen Hall, naming the institution as a centre of excellence. The report stated that Swinfen Hall was a place \\"in which the needs as well as the characteristics of young, adolescent prisoners, are understood and catered for\\". The prisons anti-bullying schemes and programmes which examine offending behaviour were also praised. A major building project began at Swinfen Hall in spring 2004, following significant increases in the prison population. The new construction was to develop existing accommodation and facilities for prisoners. In January 2006, Swinfen Hall was one of only five institutions to get the top ranking in the list compiled by the Prison Service, achieving the level four category which is reserved for prisons which are exceptionally high performing and which consistently meet or exceed targets.  The prison today  Swinfen Hall receives young offenders (aged 18-25) serving 4 years to life. The prison also holds Category C prisoners serving over 4 years. Prisoners are housed in 9 wings, in single cell accommodation. Swinfen Hall is piloting a scheme in preparation for the proposed abolition of detention in a young offender institution for those under 21. The work at Swinfen Hall is at the heart of the government's overall delivery plan for reducing reoffending. At Swinfen Hall individual needs are identified early, and through an active and integrated regime of education skills training and the specialised accredited offending behaviour and substance abuse courses, needs are addressed and risks reduced. Working together with national corporations, local businesses, voluntary organisations, the Learning and Skills Council, education providers and others, contributes to the success of the training and development needs for prisoners at Swinfen Hall and prepares them for a crime free life on release. Many prisoners say illegal drugs are easy to get.Swinfen Hall prison cell windows have 'no glass' BBC References External links * Ministry of Justice pages on Swinfen Hall Swinfen Hall Swinfen Hall Swinfen Hall Swinfen Hall ","title":"HM Prison Swinfen Hall"},{"id":"19999375","text":"Nunca el Tiempo es Perdido is the second solo studio album from Spanish musician Manolo Garc√≠a, formerly of the band El √öltimo de la Fila.

A (unary) container is defined by a type of shapes S and a type family of positions P, indexed by S. The extension of a container is a family of dependent pairs consisting of a shape (of type S) and a function from positions of that shape to the element type. Containers can be seen as canonical forms for collection types. For lists, the shape type is the natural numbers (including zero). The corresponding position types are the types of natural numbers less than the shape, for each shape. For trees, the shape type is the type of trees of units (that is, trees with no information in them, just structure). The corresponding position types are isomorphic to the types of valid paths from the root to particular nodes on the shape, for each shape. Note that the natural numbers are isomorphic to lists of units. In general the shape type will always be isomorphic to the original non-generic container type family (list, tree etc.) applied to unit. One of the main motivations for introducing the notion of containers is to support generic programming in a dependently typed setting.  Categorical aspects  The extension of a container is an endofunctor. It takes a function \`g\` to \\\\lambda\\\\left(s,f\\\\right).\\\\left(s,g\\\\circ f\\\\right) This is equivalent to the familiar \`map g\` in the case of lists, and does something similar for other containers.  Indexed containers  Indexed containers (also known as dependent polynomial functors) are a generalisation of containers, which can represent a wider class of types, such as vectors (sized lists). The element type (called the input type) is indexed by shape and position, so it can vary by shape and position, and the extension (called the output type) is also indexed by shape.

During her tenure she received substantial media attention for various ODJFS related activities, and for her role in the Controversial Ohio database searches of Joe Wurzelbacher. Background A licensed attorney, Jones-Kelley received her Bachelor's degree in Secondary English Education from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio and her law degree from the University of Dayton School of Law. Prior to law school, Jones-Kelley studied at the Scripps Gerontology Center at Miami University. She then worked for a bank before working for the Cincinnati Recreation Department for nine years. Jones-Kelley was appointed the co-chair of Ohio's Advisory Council on Children, Youth and Families in 2003. Before Jones-Kelley began her work with Children Services, she served as an Assistant Legal Director for Montgomery County Juvenile Court. In this position, she started the program Court Appointed Special Advocate, or \\"CASA.\\" Career =Workshops= Helen Jones-Kelley has frequently presented workshops on children and the law, including for the American Bar Association, National Court Appointed Special Advocate Association, and others. Helen-Jones was selected as one of the \\"Ten Top Women\\" in Dayton, Ohio in 1996 and one of the Ten Top African-American Women in 2002, and other awards. She is now (Feb 2018) serving as the executive director of Montgomery County Alcohol Drug Addiction Mental Health Services-ADAMHS =Director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services= Jones-Kelley, a Democrat, was selected to run the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, by Governor-elect Ted Strickland, at the end of 2006. ODJFS oversees programs helping pregnant women with health care issues while also helping unemployed workers and senior citizens find food and shelter. As director of ODJFS, Jones-Kelley has stated that one of her top priorities is, \\"to increase input from county departments and better coordinate efforts.\\" Jones-Kelley, as Director of the ODJFS, has commented numerous times on the jobless rate for Ohio during 2008. In March 2008, Jones- Kelley commented, \\"News that the unemployment rate declined slightly must be tempered by the fact that total employment decreased in both goods-producing and service-providing industries.\\" Also, Jones-Kelley commented in May that payroll had fallen and that the economy had remained \\"sluggish.\\" ODJFS database search While in office, Jones-Kelly became embroiled in a controversy over searches of the government records of Joe Wurzelbacher (\\"Joe the Plumber\\") in the last few weeks of the 2008 US Presidential election campaign. State and local officials conducted an investigation into whether Jones-Kelley's order to access Ohio government databases was illegal; they concluded on November 20, 2008, that the searches breached protocol but found there was no evidence to prove they were part of a political agenda or linked with a political group or campaign. The Attorney General's office of Ohio conducted the investigation. Thomas Charles, the Inspector General of Ohio, also headed an investigation. At the start of the investigation, Ohio State Rep. William Batchelder, R-Medina, called for Jones-Kelley to explain her agency's actions in reviewing individuals who have been the subject of news stories. In a written response to a letter from Ohio Senate President Bill Harris, Jones-Kelly defended her decision to approve of the search on Wurzelbacher after the third presidential debate: > Given our understanding that Mr. Wurzelbacher had publicly indicated that he > had the means to purchase a substantial business enterprise, ODJFS, > consistent with past departmental practice, checked confidential databases > to make sure that if Mr. Wurzelbacher did owe child support, or unemployment > compensation taxes, or was receiving public assistance, appropriate action > was being taken. The result of those checks have never been publicly shared. According to The Columbus Dispatch on November 14, 2008, \\"In response to a public-records request, the state agency said yesterday that it had no records involving previous checks of the type that Director Helen Jones-Kelley authorized on 'Joe the Plumber.'\\" Tom Hayes and Barbara Riley, both previous directors of ODJFS, have responded to Jones-Kelley's searches and stated that they did not conduct searches due to an individuals status being raised to \\"celebrity\\". Inspector General report On November 20, 2008, Inspector General Charles reported that the reasons that Helen Jones-Kelley provided for the checks on Wurzelbacher \\"were not credible and they included contradictions, ambiguity, and inconsistencies\\". Charles found that Jones- Kelley \\"improperly authorized searches of state databases for information on Samuel Joseph ‚Äî 'Joe the Plumber' ‚Äî Wurzelbacher.\\" Charles has provided the report to the prosecutor's office of Franklin County, Ohio for their review and consideration. After reviewing the report, Strickland suspended Jones- Kelley for a month without pay, but rejected requests for her to be terminated. In response to the improper records search, Republican Ohio state representative Shannon Jones sponsored House Bill 648 which would mandate \\"the firing of any unclassified state employee who improperly accesses confidential personal information\\". On December 10, 2008, the bill passed the Ohio House of Representatives by a vote of 69 to 26. On December 17, 2008, the bill passed the Ohio Senate by a vote of 30 to 2. On January 6, 2009, Governor Ted Strickland signed House Bill 648, creating civil and criminal penalties for violations of rules concerning access to personal information on state databases. Use of ODJFS e-mail On November 7, 2008, Strickland placed Jones-Kelley on paid leave \\"for possibly using a state computer and e-mail account for political fundraising\\". Strickland stated that this action was taken \\"due to the possibility, as yet unconfirmed, that a state computer or state e-mail account was used to assist in political fund raising\\". According to WYTV, Strickland has released e-mails showing that Jones-Kelley \\"used her state-issued e-mail account to send names of potential contributors to the Obama campaign\\". The November 20 Inspector General report found this use of state e-mail resources \\"to engage in political activity\\" improper.Business Ethics: Case Studies and Selected Readings: Case Studies and Selected Readings] Marianne M. Jennings  Cengage Learning, Jan 1, 2011 page 541 Resignation On December 17, 2008, Jones-Kelley resigned from her position as director of ODJFS. Along with her resignation, Jones-Kelley issued a statement. \\"This decision comes after a time of pause, in which I realize that I continue to be used as a political postscript, providing a distraction from urgent state priorities.\\" Two members of Jones-Kelley's staff, who had both been suspended after being implicated in the ODJFS computer records search, also left their positions due to resignation and removal. Governor Strickland's spokesperson stated that the governor \\"values Helen Jones- Kelley's years of public service as a dedicated advocate for the most vulnerable among us\\". Upon Jones-Kelley's resignation, Douglas E. Lumpkin was chosen by Governor Ted Strickland to replace her as director of ODJFS. Judicial Watch lawsuit On March 5, 2009, in a U.S. District Court in Columbus, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit charging that Jones-Kelley (along with employees Fred Williams and Doug Thompson) improperly searched \\"confidential state databases\\" in an attempt to retaliate against Joe Wurzelbacher's criticism of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. The lawsuit states that the actions of these individuals \\"are sufficient to chill or silence a person of ordinary firmness from future First Amendment activities\\". Judicial Watch filed the federal civil rights lawsuit on behalf of Wurzelbacher, alleging that \\"officials of the State of Ohio violated Mr. Wurzelbacher's constitutional rights by illegally accessing confidential information from its official databases\\". The Associated Press reports that Jones-Kelley must respond to the lawsuit within 20 days. Jones-Kelley's attorney, H. Ritchey Hollenbaugh, has declined to comment on the lawsuit and has stated that he is \\"studying it.\\" On May 7, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Jones-Kelly, \\"denies that she authorized state searches about the man known as 'Joe the Plumber' after he questioned Barack Obama on the 2008 campaign trail\\". In addition, she \\"acknowledged donating $2,500 to the Obama campaign but denied providing additional help\\". On November 15, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Jones-Kelley, along with two other \\"former state employees\\", were sued by Wurzelbacher for \\"illegally accessed his personal information leading up to last fall's presidential election\\". On August 4, 2010, the U.S District Court in Columbus dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that the privacy violation did not amount to a constitutional violation to the right to privacy. Personal life Helen Jones-Kelley lives in Clayton, Ohio with her husband, Tom Kelley, and four daughters. She also has a stepson.

It occupies 12 acres and in 2015 had some 27,000 visitors. History Borth Animalarium was opened in the late 1980s at Ynys Fergi, half a mile from Borth town centre, by Ron and Ann Crowther. Starting as a hobby, the zoo expanded gradually into a business, concentrating on breeding of animals for conservation, working closely with Chester Zoo and the Northern Zoological Society on breeding programmes for harvest mice and capybara. The zoo was sold in 2000 to Jean and Alan Mumbray who ran it for 15 years before announcing that they were putting it up for sale in June 2015. The zoo was bought in early 2017 by Dean and Tracy Tweedy, an artist and psychotherapist couple from Milton Regis in Kent, who planned to use the facility for animal therapy, making it a sanctuary for both animals and people. Their purchase of the zoo was covered in a three part report on BBC's The One Show in September 2017. On transfer of ownership, the zoo is stated to have been in need of significant improvement to bring it up to modern zoo standards, with the lynx enclosure particularly being not fit for purpose. The zoo was the subject of a three programme BBC television series called Saving Britain's Worst Zoo. The series aired in July and August 2019. Animal exhibits Animals kept at Borth Animalarium include big cats, monkeys, wallabies, snakes, iguanas, caimans, fruit bats, spiders, emu, pigs, frogs, ocelots, and cockroaches.Animalarium animals In 2005, the zoo took on an African leopard named Rajah. The cat, bred at Basildon Zoo in Essex in 1995, had been sold to a private owner but was given up after it tried to kill its owner. In 2013, the zoo took in a three month old female Lynx named Nilly, who was partially hand-reared. A female companion was brought in for her in May 2016. The new animal turned out to be pregnant and gave birth to three kittens two days later, two of which survived and were named Tirion and Lilleth. In August 2015 the Animalarium took delivery of two African Lion, named Zulu and Wilma, from Noah's Ark Zoo Farm in Somerset Controversies Early in the zoo's history, it made the news when a capybara escaped and was found in the River Leri. In September 2010, the Mumbrays were fined ¬£1,237.50 plus costs at Aberystwyth Magistrates' Court for displaying animals without proper paperwork. In addition to the fine, nine of the zoo's animals were ordered to be confiscated including the zoo's leopard, two lynx and two ring tailed lemurs. The couple vowed to fight against the confiscation order, and several attempts to take the animals were unsuccessful due in part to paperwork irregularities and a lack of co-operation from the leopard. In July 2012, a beaver escaped from the zoo. In August 2013, the zoo again made the news when a leopard nearly escaped from its enclosure when its cage door was accidentally left open. In late October 2017 it was reported that an 18 month old, adult lynx had escaped from her enclosure at some point in the previous week. It was reported that seven sheep had been killed in the days following her escape, approximately 500 metres from the zoo, although the zoo owners insisted the lynx was not responsible. After more than a week evading capture, the lynx was shot dead by a marksman under the instruction of Ceredigion County Council when it wandered into a populated area. The killing of the lynx was criticised both by the local community and by celebrities including wildlife broadcaster Chris Packham, who sent a bottle of Lynx deodorant to the council, saying that their decision \\"stinks\\". The council later stated that there had been no possibility to use a tranquiliser dart and that euthanizing the lynx was the only realistic option. It later emerged that the operators of the zoo had been warned twice in the months leading up to the escape that trees were too tall in the lynx enclosure and that there was a significant risk of escape. The zoo owners protested about the killing of the lynx, saying they were \\"outraged\\" about the incident. It later emerged that another lynx had been accidentally killed several days earlier when it asphyxiated as it was being controlled with a catchpole while being moved to another enclosure. The second death drew wide criticism, with calls for the zoo to be shut down. In the wake of the incident, people from the local community rallied around the owners, with nearly 150 turning up to help refurbish the zoo. Following the lynx escape, the zoo was banned from keeping \\"category one\\" dangerous animals, including large cats. The ban on keeping category one animals was reversed in July 2018 following an inspection of the zoo by Ceredigion council officials, on the condition that a qualified and experienced keeper was employed. The ban was re-imposed in January 2020 due to the zoo having insufficient members of staff with firearms certificates. In March 2020 it was reported that a fifth of the animals housed at the zoo had died within the space of a year. Two days later the it was reported that two African antelopes had escaped.

Caricature by Joseph Middleton Jopling,Jopling's original watercolour of Sir Coutts Lindsay, 2nd Bt is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. published in Vanity Fair in 1883. Sir Coutts Lindsay, 2nd Baronet (2 February 1824 - 7 May 1913 Kingston upon Thames), was a British artist and watercolourist. Life Lindsay was the eldest son of Lieutenant- General Sir James Lindsay, son of the Hon. Robert Lindsay, second son of James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres. His mother was Anne, daughter of Sir Coutts Trotter, 1st Baronet, a principal partner in Coutt's Bank. Robert Loyd- Lindsay, 1st Baron Wantage, was his younger brother. In 1839 he succeeded by special remainder to his maternal grandfather's baronetcy (which became extinct on Lindsay's own death).thepeerage.com Sir Coutts Lindsay, 2nd Bt He then entered the army, commanding the 1st Regiment of the Italian Legion during the Crimean War before retiring from military life to devote himself to art. From 1862 to 1874 he exhibited many pictures, including various successful portraits. In 1879 he and his first wife, Lady Lindsay (of Balcarres), were both elected to membership of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours. His studio at 4-5 Cromwell Place was also used by Archibald Stuart-Wortley. He and his first wife founded the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 as an alternative to the Royal Academy. It was devoted to exhibiting works by the Pre-Raphaelites (then held to be too stylistically advanced for the Royal Academy) and becoming the focus of the Aesthetic Movement from then until its closure in 1890. Its inaugural exhibition on 1 May 1877 included James Whistler's Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket, leading to the famous libel trial between Whistler and John Ruskin. Coutts was important to the careers of Coutts' friends Whistler and George Frederic Watts in providing a sympathetic venue for the display of their work. However, the gallery declined after Lindsay separated from his first wife, and it closed in 1890. In the 30 years before her death she then lived in London and Venice, gathering a circle of friends including Alma Tadema, GF Watts and Robert Browning and collecting a number of fine paintings (some of which she left to the National Gallery). She also published several volumes of poetry, including From a Venetian Balcony (1903) and Poems of Love and Death (1907). Marriages He first married in 1864 to the distinguished artist, novelist and poet Caroline Blanche Elizabeth Fitzroy (born 1844, died 10 August 1912, London), daughter of the Rt. Hon. Henry Fitzroy by his wife Hannah Mayer de Rothschild (daughter of Nathan Meyer Rothschild). Her portrait by Joseph Middleton Jopling is at the National Portrait Gallery, London. His daughter Harriet Euphemia Susan Lindsay married Thomas Selby Henrey, who was father of Robert Selby Henry, who was father of Bobby Henrey.

These essential requirements are publicised in European directives or regulations. A manufacturer can use voluntarily European harmonised standards to demonstrate that a product complies with some (or all) of the EU essential requirements; a notified body can use the same harmonised standards to assess the conformity to these essential requirements. Conformity assessment can include inspection and examination of a product, its design, and the manufacturing environment and processes associated with it. For example, a notified body may designate that a medical device conforms to the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR (EU) 2017/745) which defines the applicable legislation, including the general safety and performance requirements, for medical devices. With this declaration of conformity, the manufacturer can label the product with the CE Mark, which is required for distribution and sale in the EU. Additionally, the EU member state accrediting the notified body will then inform the European Commission that the product complies with set standards (or not). More generally, a notified body is an independent, accredited body which is entitled by an authorized accrediting body. Upon definition of standards and regulations, the accrediting body may allow a notified body to provide verification and certification services. These services are meant to ensure and assess compliance to the previously defined standards and regulations, but also to provide an official certification mark or a declaration of conformity. Criticism and improvement The notified bodies system used by the European Union has been publicly criticized in some capacity since at least 2008 for issues such as: * \\"a lack of uniformity in certification procedures and in the application of harmonised standards\\"; * \\"the varying levels of expertise among notified bodies,\\" including \\"differences in test results\\"; and * \\"encouraging 'forum shopping' by sponsors to identify those notified bodies with the most lax operating standards.\\" Discussion of further expanding coordination groups of notified bodies for different product areas, improving marketing surveillance, and making participation in standardization and coordination activities mandatory began within EU member states. However, more criticism would arise out of the Poly Implant Proth√®se (PIP) scandal in early 2010, when media revealed that the French manufacturer of silicone gel breast implants had been using unapproved in-house manufactured industrial-grade instead of medical- grade silicone for most of its implants. Investigators also brought criticism down on notified body T√úV Rheinland for issuing a certificate of quality for a production process that didn't include the in-house industrial-grade silicone. However, T√úV stated \\"its remit was to check the production process, not the content of the silicone.\\" The revelation had a ripple effect, causing both more criticism about the responsibilities of notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 \\"to develop the effectiveness of the regulatory system on medical devices in the EU by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities.\\" Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli called upon EU member states to take a hard look at the regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a notified body is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms ‚Äî separate from its draft regulations ‚Äî that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their code of conduct due to criticism. In late 2013 and early 2014, a French court ordered (and later upheld its decision) that notified body T√úV Rheinland pay restitution to those affected by the PIP scandal. However, this decision and a similar case in Germany has created questions about how much liability should be applied to notified bodies for patient devices found to be dangerous despite previous notified body assessment. The German case against T√úV was dismissed initially and on appeal in district and regional courts, and an appeal to a German federal court resulted in referral of the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for clarification \\"on three issues on the interpretation of the Medical Devices Directive.\\" Additionally, the original restitution decision by French courts was appealed and overturned on July 2, 2015, forcing affected patients to return their interim compensation, leaving many patients without recourse. , the German case is ongoing, waiting for CJEU input. Rudd-Clarke and Page postulated in December 2015 that if \\"the CJEU decides that notified bodies are under a duty to protect patients, the practical effects could be that the CE certification process slows down, which is likely to have a detrimental impact on the cost for manufacturers of getting a product to market, while notified bodies may face a significantly increased litigation risk for failure to comply with their duties.\\" Regulations governing medical device manufacturers and Notified Bodies operating in the medical device field were thightened with the Medical Device Regulation of 2017. Nando database The European Union maintains an online database of accredited notified bodies. The Nando (New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations) Information System allows citizens and economic entities to search and validate the status of the notification of a notified body for certain regulations and directives.https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools- databases/nando/index.cfm?fuseaction=notifiedbody.main See also * Accreditation * Deutsches Institut f√ºr Bautechnik References External links * European Commission portal on notified bodies * European Commission portal on harmonised standards * European Commission 2014 Action Plan * Category:Accreditation Category:Regulation in the European Union Category:Product certification Category:Regulation of medical devices ","title":"Notified body"},{"id":"19999619","text":"Saar Ganor is an Israeli archaeologist.
