The group underwent a series of lineup changes in its early years; of the group's early members, only Werther Lohse, who joined the group in 1974, is still a member. Their first album was released in 1977; shortly after this, members Henry Pacholski and Gerhard Zachar were killed in a traffic accident while touring in Poland. Two further LPs were issued in 1979 and 1981, after which time the group fell from fame. Their 1987 album is now something of a rarity.

The nature of video sculpture is that it utilizes the material of video in an innovative way in space and time, different from the standard traditional narrative screening where the video has a beginning and end. In one definition video sculpture involves one or more monitors or projections that spectators move among or stand in front of. Video sculptures formed of more than one screen or projection may broadcast a single program or may simultaneously broadcast different interconnected sequences on several channels. The screens used in the sculpture can be arranged in many different ways. For example, they can be suspended from a ceiling, aligned and stacked to make a video wall or even randomly stacked on top of each other. Video sculpture is a medium that offers performing artists a chance to have a more permanent artistic forum. Video sculpture includes projection mapping on objects and environments. This has become more accessible and popular due to software advancements in the last five years. History In the late 1950s and early 1960s, artists Wolf Vostell and Edward Kienholz began experimenting with televisions by using them in their happenings and assemblages respectively. In March 1963, Nam June Paik's debuted his video sculpture entitled Music/Electronic Television at the Parnass Gallery in Wupertal, which used 13 altered televisions. In May 1963 Wolf Vostell shows his installation 6 TV-D√©-coll/age at the Smolin Gallery in New York utilized six televisions, each with an anomaly. Shigeko Kubota was also an innovator in the use of video in sculptural form. Her Duchampiana: Nude Descending a Staircase was the first video sculpture acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. This work is a reference to Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 (1912) Video sculpturist are becoming influential among early 21st century artists. One of Paik's video sculptures in which the six windows of a 1936 Chrysler Airstream were replaced with video monitors sold for $75,000 in 2002. Charlotte Moorman was a notable subject of video sculptures as a renowned topless cellist. Current developments There are several developments in current video sculptures. The proliferation of powerful projectors and pixel-bending technology has enabled large-scale works often created for specific events and locations. Other artists like make use of multiple LCD screens or video walls and incorporate computer generated images. A different approach is used by artists like Madeleine Altmann, who creates sculptures with recycled cathode ray tube monitors.

They attended the California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, M.F.A., from 1982‚Äì84. Since at least 2017, Blake has opted to use ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù pronouns, a decision that they explained was made partly in solidarity with those whose gender expression does not fit a binary, as well as a nod to their own hybrid racial and sexual identity.Subcultural Treasures, Art in America, Brian Droitcour, May 1, 2018.\\"Overcoming Daily Life with Nayland Blake‚Äôs Daily Drawings\\", Hyperallergic, Louis Bury, December 14, 2017 Work Nayland Blake began displaying their work in 1985. Among their most famous pieces are a log cabin made of gingerbread squares fitted to a steel frame, entitled Feeder 2 (1998). When it went on display at the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery, visitors furtively nibbled off bits and pieces of the cabin's interior walls, while the smell of the gingerbread filled the gallery. Another well-known work is Starting Over (2000), a video of the artist dancing with taps on their shoes in a bunny suit made to weigh the same as his partner at the time. The suit was so heavy that Blake could hardly move as they took choreographic directions from offstage. Gorge (1998) is a video of the artist sitting shirtless being hand-fed an enormous amount of food for an hour by a shirtless black man from behind. In 2009, a live version of Gorge was staged in which audience members fed Blake. Their work often incorporates themes of masochism.

After first attending Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, he graduated from Syracuse University in 1962. Early career In 1960 O‚ÄôNeal was introduced to a representative of the Central Intelligence Agency and ultimately accepted employment with that organization. He reported for duty in January 1963 and remained with the CIA in Washington D.C. and New York City until 1976. He served in the US Army during the same period (1962‚Äì1967), rising to the rank of Captain. The nature of his employment allowed him the flexibility of pursuing other interests during these years.

Long before Berenice AbbottBerenice Abbott - American Photographer (McGraw- Hill, 1982) admonished him to always have a project, he undertook his first, in rural East Texas during 1970-1973. These photographs led to his first exhibition in September 1973, at The Open Mind Gallery in New York City. In the 1970s he associated with a diverse group of photographers, notably Walker Evans, Andr√© Kert√©sz and most importantly, Berenice Abbott, with whom he worked for the last 19 years of her life. From 1970 to 1999 (in addition to undertaking many photographic projects), O‚ÄôNeal also published numerous books related to photography. In 1999, at the urging of gallery director Evelyne Daitz, he had a major retrospective of his work to that point at The Witkin Gallery.The Witkin Gallery Since that time, he has focused his activities toward photography, and continues to mount exhibitions yearly throughout the U.S. and Canada.

Extending along Chestnut and Franklin Streets south of Peabody City Hall, the district includes a small residential area built in the mid-19th century, as well as the city hall and St. JOhn the Baptist Roman Catholic Church, two monumental structures defining the town's civic heart. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The city of Peabody was originally part of Salem, and was, after a series of political divisions, incorporated separately as South Danvers in 1855. It was renamed Peabody, after philanthropist George Peabody, in 1868, and was reincorporated as a city in 1911. The area where the city center developed was settled as early as 1634, when a grist mill was built on Proctor Brook north of what is now Lowell Street. A church was built on the south side of Lowell Street in 1711, and open land to its south was used as a commons and militia training ground. The area developed residentially in the 1840s, when Lowell Street (not part of the district except City Hall) was lined with small businesses such as shoe shops, resulting in a collection of Greek Revival and Italianate houses. The area's significance as the city center was cemented with the construction in the 1870s of St. John's, an imposing Victorian Gothic brick building, and the 1880s construction of City Hall, a 3-1/2 story Second Empire building. The historic district is anchored at its northeastern corner by City Hall, and is roughly L shape extending south and then west from there. It includes housing along Chestnut Street between Lowell and Franklin Street, and along Franklin between Chestnut and School Streets. To the west of City Hall, it includes the main St. John's edifice, as well as the associated rectory and convent.

After some six months, as a result of the initiatives of Sultana resident Budhai (Boliya) Mahato, Bajralal Chaudhary and other villagers, the primary school was moved to Sultana, 2 miles from Mujhai. The first teacher of the school was Ramnath Pande. In B.S.2013, the school was relocated to Khairahini. The land currently occupied by the school was the place of the Dharma Godam which was in bad condition. By B.S.2014, the building of Dharma Godam and 1 bigha 15 Kattha of land was transferred to the school through an auction and the school was shifted from Khairahini to where it now remains. In B.S.2019 through the Shailendra Kumar Aayog, the school received 13 Bigaha of land but the land survey in B.S.2026 verified only 11 Bigaha and 7 Kattha land to be belonging to the school. Through some legal procedures, under the involvement of the Rameshwor Pande, Purendra Kumar Mainali, and other aware parents of the region in B.S.2024, the school began conducting high school level education with government approval. The first principal of the school after this transformation was Purendra Kumar Mainali.

Coffin is recognised as the first person to exploit the rich coal fields of the Rhondda Valley on an industrial scale, pioneering the growth of one of the most wealthy coal mining areas in the world. Early life Born in 1784 he was the second son of Walter Coffin, the founder of a tanning business in Bridgend, and his second wife Anne Morgan. Coffin was descended from a well known Bridgend family, the Prices of Ty'n Ton, into which his grandfather, an owner of an estate in Selworthy, had married.Randall, H. J. Bridgend: the story of a market town (Newport, 1955) pg. 49 Coffin was educated at Cowbridge Grammar School and later at a nonconformist academy in Exeter; in 1804 he returned to Wales to join the family business. In 1791 his father had purchased several farmsteads in the parish of Llantrisant, including the area of Dinas Uchef Farm from William Humphries. In 1809, at the age of 24 and bored with the tanning industry, Walter Coffin the younger set out to prospect for coal at his father's farm land in Dinas. He terminated the tenancy of Lewis Robert Richard at the site and with the financial support of his father began prospecting. Coal mining in South Wales Coffin faced four major problems while prospecting for coal in lower Rhondda: there was little known of the geology of the area, there were few skilled miners in the locality, there were no transport links for three miles and there was no proven outside market. Coffin opened at least five levels in the area, his first at the Graig Vein (the Rhondda No. 1 seam) was of poor quality and thickness, but his second, also in 1809 reached the Rhondda No.2 Seam which was of a good quality. This prompted Coffin to extend his mineral lease and sink a vertical shaft. At a depth of 40 yards a good seam of bituminous coal was struck at the Dinas Lower Colliery. When Coffin marketed his \\"Dynas No. 3\\" coal, later known as \\"Coffin's Coal\\", it gained an excellent reputation for its quality and low impurities, popular in metal working and coking. Coffin then needed to address the issue of transport. In 1794 the Glamorganshire Canal was completed, linking the ironworks of Merthyr to Coffin's intended market at Cardiff Docks. One of the early proprietors of the canal, Dr. Richard Griffiths, had constructed a two-mile tramroad from his own coal level at Denia (Pontypridd), bridging the River Taff before his own private canalwork linked to the Glamorganshire Canal at Treforest. Coffin quickly made arrangements to construct a one-mile tramline to connect his mines in Dinas to that at Griffiths's Denia level and by 1810 the two men entered an agreement ensuring all coal raised in the Lower Rhondda used their interconnecting lines. Coffin now had transport links to the coast, his next step would be in finding a market. Coffin became a deputy chairman of the Taff Vale Railway in 1846, and in 1855 its Chairman.British History Online Political career and later life In 1812, Coffin moved his family from Nolton in Bridgend to Llandaff Court in Cardiff, a move which saw his influence and standing increase. He became a Justice of the Peace around the early 1830s and in 1835 was an alderman of Cardiff. He continued his rise in society becoming the mayor of Cardiff in 1848.Williamston TheRhondda.com Coffin became a Member of Parliament for Cardiff (1852‚Äì57) as a Unitarian Liberal, and was the Wales's first Nonconformist parliamentary representative.Cardiff Timeline During his five years in the House of Commons, he never addressed the house. In 1857 he gave up his seat in Parliament and moved permanently to England to be near his family. In 1867 he died at his home in Kensington, but was buried at the Unitatian Church graveyard, Park Street, Bridgend. Neither he nor his siblings married and the family name died out with their deaths. In 1972 the Church Trustees of the Park Street Church removed Coffin's gravestone and covered the grave with tarmac. Although Bridgend Council found no infringement to planning regulations, the actions caused local resentment to the destruction of \\"an important historical relic\\".

Born in Rome, Eleutherius's father died when he was a young child and his mother, Anthia, took him to Anicetus, the Bishop of Rome, who taught him in the divine scriptures. Eleutherius is venerated as a bishop of Illyricum; according to tradition, Antia was his mother. According to a source in Greek dating from before the 5th century, Antia was the widow of a consul named Eugenius. Her son Eleutherius was ordained a deacon and priest and then consecrated as bishop by a man named Anicetus. This tradition may have originated through confusion with Pope Eleutherius, who may have been a deacon of Pope Anicetus (c. 154-164). The tradition states that Eleutherius was appointed bishop of Messina and Illyricum at the age of twenty and apparently settled in Valona. He was imprisoned by a comes named Felix; Eleutherius and Antia were taken to Rome to be judged by the Emperor Hadrian. According to this source, Eleutherius and Antia were both condemned to death on December 15. According to tradition, Eleutherius was clubbed to death, while Antia was beheaded. A Latin translation of this Greek text, dating from around the 8th century, states that Anicetus, after consecrating Eleutherius, assigned him to the see of Apuliam Aecanam civitatem (Aeca). Eleutherius and Antia were then taken to Rome and killed on April 18. The source states that the citizens of Aeca retrieved the bodies of the two martyrs from Rome and returned to their city with them. Baronius uses the descriptive Episcopi Illyrici (bishop of Illyricum) in his Roman Martyrology, since he consulted the Greek source. Hippolyte Delehaye believed the association with Aeca was erroneous, and centuries earlier, Florus had believed Apuliam Aecanam was an error for Apuliam Messenam (Messina), but the association with Messina may also be erroneous. The confusion is increased when it is taken into account the fact that Eleutherius' name, which means \\"one who is free,\\" was translated into Latin as Liberator or Liberalis; he may have been confused with other saints named Liberalis. Messina still claims Eleutherius and Antia as natives, stating that he was born in this Sicilian city on April 18, 121, and that later Eleutherius became a bishop of Illyricum. They were tortured with hot boiling oil, resin, and heated irons, and then thrown to the lions; none had the desired effect and finally the two were executed. Their bodies were then, according to tradition, buried in the Roman church of Santa Sabina, in the altar of San Lorenzo, and then moved to San Giovanni della Pigna, near the Pantheon, with the relics of Genesius of Rome. The association with San Giovanni della Pigna may also be a result of confusion with Pope Eleuterus, whose relics were also said to have been translated to San Giovanni della Pigna. Christians from Rieti then may have carried their relics to their city, which still claims them. Veneration San Liberatore a Maiella. Despite this confusion, Eleutherius' cult is ancient and widespread, and his name appears not only in ancient Greek calendars, but also in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum (under April 18, September 5, November 24, where it states ‚Äúin civitate Riatensi‚Äù, a reference to Rieti, where he was also venerated);\\"And very soon Rieti had its first martyrs, the priest Marone and Vittorio di Cotilia: later on Eleuterio and his mother Anzia\\". See www.dopropertysearch.co.uk the Marble Calendar of Naples (under April 18), and in Mozarabic calendars.  Rieti  The church of Sant'Eleuterio was built outside of the city walls of Rieti around the 5th century. According to tradition, the church claimed the relics of Eleutherius and Antia, carried from Rome by Bishop Primus of Rieti. Around the 5th or 6th centuries, the Benedictine Stephen of Rieti founded a monastic community near the tomb of the two martyrs. Devotion to Eleutherius increased after a legend associated with the bishop Probus of Rieti: that before his death a vision appeared of the two saints, Eleutherius and Juvenal (Giovenale), to accompany the bishop into heaven. The church of Sant'Eleuterio acquired importance during the age of the Lombards, with its foundation confirmed with solemn honors by Liutprand. It acquired greater splendor after 1000 AD, when Peter, a local abbot, restored the church and its monastery, which lay near a stream and the city cemetery. In 1122, Count Grimald granted Sant'Eleuterio, the monastery, and its lands to the Cathedral of Santa Maria of Rieti. On August 13, 1198, Bishop Adolphus Secenari and Pope Innocent III translated the relics of the two saints to the cathedral, elevating the church to the status of a collegiate church with twelve canon priests and an abbot-rector.  Other places in Italy  Numerous churches rose in Italy in honor of this saint. There was a church dedicated to him at Rome, on the Via Labicana. He was venerated on April 18 at Nepi, Vasto, and at Poreƒç (Parenzo) in Istria. At Chieti, Benevento, Salerno, and Sulmona, he was venerated on May 21; at Terracina on May 13; on May 23 at Arce, and on 31 December at Canne, where he described as a bishop of that town and a son of Evantia (a corruption of Antia). There were other churches dedicated to him at Mugnano del Cardinale and Ariano Irpino. The monastery of San Liberatore a Maiella is dedicated to him.

It is representative of Topsfield's development first as an agricultural community, and later as place for rural retreats. The district, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005, is roughly bounded by River Road, Rowley Bridge Road, Cross Street, Hill Street, and Salem Road, and also includes properties facing Prospect Street and Bradstreet Lane. Much of the district was consolidated under the ownership of William Appleton Coolidge in the 20th century, and bequeathed to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with restrictions to preserve its rural character. MIT sold the donated properties in 2000. The district includes nineteen properties distributed across in a rural landscape that includes open farmlands, historic farmsteads, 19th and 20th century estate houses, and scenic views of the Ipswich River, which runs through the center of the district. Some of these lands have been worked since the early colonial days of Topsfield's history. The oldest houses in the district, the Zaccheus Gould House and the Stanley Lake House, date to the late 17th century, and are separately listed on the National Register. There are also several houses dating to the middle and late 18th century, notably two that were built by John Balch on Hill Street. The area began a gradual transformation from a strictly agricultural use to that of a rural retreat area as early as 1807, when the Perkins-Pingree House was built at 49 Salem Road. This high Federal style house is one of the finest of its type in Topsfield. Two important large-scale estates in the area are the Meredith Farm (29 and 41 Cross Street) and the Cummings Estate (82 River Road). The Meredith Farm was developed as a rural retreat by Boston developer J. Morris Meredith, who built an Arts and Crafts style estate house on the property, while preserving the historic Daniel Bixby farmstead (built c. 1800). The Cummings Estate was the work of Margaret Cummings, who purchased land that had long been in the hands of the Lake family, early Topsfield settlers, in the early 20th century. Her brother, architect Charles Kimball Cummings, designed a collection of Tudor Revival buildings for the estate, and it was landscaped to designs by Arthur Shurcliff, who had studied landscape design with the Olmsted Brothers.

It encompasses houses along High and Pleasant Streets from just east of Broadway to Vine Street, as well as a few that face on adjoining streets. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984; on its western boundary it abuts the Spicket Falls Historic District. Prior to 1800 Methuen, which then included part of what is now Lawrence, was a predominantly rural agricultural town. Its primary industrial facility consisted of a gristmill and cotton mill, located at the falls of the Spicket River in what is now the town center. The construction in 1806 of the Turnpike (now Broadway) led to development of a housing district to its east, on a rise overlooking the area where the falls and mills were located. By 1810 Pleasant Street and High Street (originally called George Street) had been laid out, and the earliest Federal style houses, at 36 High Street (c. 1820) and 18-20 Pleasant Street (c. 1810), soon followed. The mills were expanded in 1826 and again in 1855, bringing development in the residential area to provide housing for mill workers, and the location of the First Congregational Church (separately listed in 1978) at 30 Pleasant Street in 1832 cemented the area as the primary center of the town. After 1855 a number of Second Empire houses were built in the area, and scattered exemplars of other 19th century architectural styles followed. In 1890 mill owner David Nevins plotted out a subdivision of about 100 plots in the area of Gage and Stevens Streets, from which a number of Queen Anne, Shingle, Georgian Revival, and Colonial Revival properties (built between 1890 and 1910) survive. The principal public space in the district is the site of the American Civil War memorial, located in the triangular area where Pleasant and Charles Streets meet.

She was built in 1889 for passenger service between Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine. She is best known as the namesake of the infamous Portland Gale of 1898, a massive blizzard that struck coastal New England, claiming the lives of over 400 people and more than 150 vessels. Construction and design Portlands wooden hull was built by the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. The 1200-horsepower vertical-beam steam engine was constructed by the Portland Company, with a bore, or cylinder diameter, measuring across, together with a stroke. The ship's two iron boilers were constructed at the Bath Iron Works, also in Bath, Maine. Portland was built for the Portland Steam Packet Company (later renamed Portland Steamship Company), at a cost of $250,000, to provide overnight passenger service between Boston and Portland. She was one of New England's largest and most luxurious paddle steamers in existence at the time, and after nine years' solid performance, she had earned a reputation as a safe and dependable vessel.  Final voyage and sinking On November 27, 1898, Portland, having departed Boston earlier, was en route to Portland, Maine, following her traditional route. Unbeknownst to the crew, a powerful storm system was quickly traveling north, and Portland, despite her reputation as a remarkably safe vessel, was ill-equipped to handle such extreme conditions. At some point during the storm, Portland sank off of Cape Ann with all hands, the exact number of which cannot be determined, as the only known passenger list went down with the ship. Initial newspaper accounts at the time estimated the loss as from 99 to 118 persons. The bodies of only 16 crew and 35 passengers were ever recovered, but present-day estimates are that the Portland was carrying, in total, from 193 to 245 persons, including 63 crew. Her loss represented New England's greatest steamship disaster prior to the year 1900. Shipwreck The shipwreck is lying below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean near Gloucester, Massachusetts, at an undisclosed location within the federally- protected Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. The site was first located in 1989 by John Fish and Arnold Carr of American Underwater Search and Survey. The find was confirmed in 2002 by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expedition that used ROV's to photograph the wreck. The wreck was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Divers explore The Portland wreckage Portland, drawn in 1895 by Samuel Ward Stanton, who died on the Titanic. In 2008, five Massachusetts scuba divers became the first to reach the steamship, also known as the \\"Titanic of New England\\". The divers made three successful dives, and reported that the wreck was strewn with artifacts, like stacks of dishes, mugs, wash basins and toilets, but no human remains. They did not, however, explore below the deck because of the danger. Because of the depth of the wreck site, they reported that some of their dive lights imploded, and they could only explore the site for 10‚Äì15 minutes before needing to return to the surface. The divers \\"were unable to retrieve artifacts\\" due to rules in place at the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Another drawing of Portland by Samuel Ward Stanton. Purported site visit during WWII An earlier claim of locating and reportedly visiting the wreck of the Portland arose from the last week of June 1945. A dive commissioned by noted author Edward Rowe Snow (who is also known as the Lighthouse Santa) supposedly occurred during the last week of June through the first week of July during the last year of the war. Snow supposedly recorded the affidavit of diver Al George, from Malden, Massachusetts, in pages 178-180 of his book Strange Tales from Nova Scotia to Cape Hatteras. According to the affidavit, George found the site by traveling to a location discovered by Captain Charles G. Carver of Rockland, Maine. The site is roughly identified as follows: \\"Highland Light bears 175 degrees true at a distance of 4.5 miles; the Pilgrim Monument, 6.25 miles away has a bearing of 210 degrees; Race Point Coast Guard Station, bearing 255 degrees, is seven miles distant.\\" According to diver George, recovery of artifacts would be cost-prohibitive, and nearly impossible given the status of the wreck. Even acknowledging the likely presence of uncut diamonds in the purser's safe, George assessed the chances of recovery as a losing financial proposition, based in part on how deeply entrenched in the sand the wreck was, and how widely dispersed the impact with the bottom had spread bits and pieces of the ship. In light of more recent discovery, the accuracy of this entire account is highly questionable.

Most of its members belonged to the LVM Gang, SZA gang (Sarzana) gang and some from the Wah Ching gang. These gang members were known to also claim Fullerton Boyz against their rivals and as the gangs disbanded in Fullerton, most of them started to claim Fullerton Boyz as a gang.  History  Fullerton Boyz was founded in 1996 by a group of Korean teens living in Fullerton, CA. Fullerton Boyz were not considering themselves as a gang but rather as a faction of two dominant Asian gangs in Fullerton, which were the LVM Gang and Sarzana street gangs. This fraction also composed of members of the Wah Ching gang that were living in Fullerton at the time. In the mid 1990s most of the LVM Gang, Sarzana, and Wah Ching gang members in Fullerton were arrested during an intense police investigation of crime sprees that involved assaults on rival gang members and home invasions. With the fallout of LVM and Sarzana, the former members started to claim Fullerton Boyz against their rivals. By the late 1990s, Fullerton Boyz membership started to grow and with it came criminal activities involving the group.  Activities  Fullerton Boyz main rivals were the Garden Grove Boyz, the Korean Trouble Makerz and Asian street gangs. The rivalry often resulted in assaults and gang brawls in each of these cities. Whomever was claiming any of these three cities were often assaulted by the others. The early 1990s was the golden age for Fullerton Boys until they started dying out. In 1993, members of Koreatown Mobsters \\"tagged\\" a car of a Fullerton Boys' member during a festival in Koreatown. In retaliation, members of Fullerton Boys agreed to meet at a park with the rivals. This caused to be deadly. It left an innocent bystander with a bullet in the chest and many of the older members were arrested. This proved to be a turning point for Fullerton Boys. With the lack of leadership and membership, they went on a hiatus. Koreatown Mobsters and its allies, Crazyies, soon went on a homicide spree which injured nearly(?) three Fullerton Boys members in a two-month period and killed one, most of them being done by shootings. In the same year, another rival gang called the Family Mobsters open(ed) fire at a restaurant parking lot. Their target was a member of the Fullerton Boys. No one was injured, but this caused another war for the Fullerton Boys. Family Mobsters and Garden Grove Boys teamed up to target Fullerton Boys. In 1994, members of the LVM Gang were arrested in a home invasion and in September, 2000, members of the Triad Boyz and the Fullerton Boyz were involved in a deadly shootout which left several injured and one dead from gunshot wounds. In the early 1990s, members of Wah Ching who were involved with Fullerton Boys were also shot by their main rivals, the Hankook Boyz.

It encompasses a dense community of 25 mainly residential structures at the western end of the Rocks Village Bridge, an early crossing point of the Merrimack River, of which 15 date to the 18th century. The village is significant for its association with the poet John Greenleaf Whittier, who was born nearby, and for the artwork of Rufus Porter, found in one of the houses. The area was designated a local historic district in 1975, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history Rocks Village, located in far eastern Haverhill, developed beginning in 1640 as a ferry crossing point on the river joining Haverhill to West Newbury, and as a local nexus for local farmers. The first bridge at this site was built in 1795, and the present Rock's Bridge, a multi- truss steel structure, dates to 1905. The oldest surviving house in the district was built in 1740, and 15 of the 25 buildings were built before 1800. Only two residences were built in the 20th century. All but one are wood frame structures, generally 1-1/2 or 2-1/2 stories in height; there is one brick house. One building, the Hand Tub House, is a fire station that has been converted into a local museum. The district is centered on the four-way junction of River Road, Wharf Lane, East Main Street, and the Rock's Bridge approach. Most of the district buildings are arrayed on Wharf Lane and River Road, with a few on East Main Street. The bridge is the only portion of the district extending into West Newbury. The 1750 Ingalls House is notable for two reasons: first, it has murals on its walls drawn by the itinerant painter Rufus Porter, and it was the birthplace of Mary Ingalls, the first countess to be born in New England. Also known as the \\"Countess House\\", the events of Ingalls' life were memorialized by poet John Greenleaf Whittier in \\"The Countess\\". Whittier, who was born nearby, dedicated the poem to Dr. Elias Weld, another occupant of that house. The restoration of the Countess House has been a continuous process for many years, culminating in it being listed on the National Register as an historic site. Thomas and Nelle Crowley (user name: ftcmoa) owned and further restored the house from 2003 to 2005. Most of the murals on the walls of the Countess House remain intact and include the following: 1 - front stairway; stag hunt running up the stairs & a steamboat drawn on the wall under the stairway. 2 - Top left, upstairs, front bedroom; four wall monochromatic views of New England, somewhat fanciful in that the mountains and trees look like they were drawn from memory of a trip to Hawaii. 3 - Back bedroom, upstairs; this low-ceilinged room with a small fireplace has murals on all four walls See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, Massachusetts References Category:Historic districts in Essex County, Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Haverhill, Massachusetts Category:West Newbury, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Essex County, Massachusetts Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts ","title":"Rocks Village Historic District"},{"id":"18749781","text":"The Old Rockport High School, now the Rockport Community House, is a historic school building at 58 Broadway in Rockport, Massachusetts.

Three years later it was reopened as a community center, a role it continues to fulfil today. The main portion of the building is a rectangular block that is minimally styled in with nominally Italianate features, such as a gable end returns and corner trim.

The main entrance to the building is now made through the side addition. The interior is dominated by decorative features that date to c. 1900. The first floor front classroom still contains a number of details from that time, including wooden floors, benches, and blackboards, although the latter have been covered over. The building when first built was only a single story. Due to growing enrollment, the building was raised in 1869 and a new first floor built. In 1890 the school was again increased in size, adding the first of the rear additions to accommodate more students as well as labs for chemistry and physics, although adequate facilities for those classes were not added until 1908. The side addition was added in 1900 to provide a stairway, making additional room in the main part of the building. Continued overcrowding and issues with the age and inadequacy of its physical plant led to the construction of a new high school in 1926.

Experimental research  Currently, approximately 250 coworkers and students (including children) live and study in Tamera which operates as an experimental research center dedicated to discovering how human beings can live peacefully among themselves and with nature, and create a successful, working, and sustainable community. Tamera is also a \\"free lab\\" and an international meeting place where peace workers and specialists in various fields from many parts of the world share their expertise. In 2008 participants from more than twenty-five different countries lived, studied, worked, or visited there.  Theory  The research in Tamera is based on a complex world view explained in detail in The Sacred Matrix by Dieter Duhm. One essential part of this theory is the \\"implicate order\\" of David Bohm. Another is the \\"morphic field\\" theory developed by Rupert Sheldrake, where only a few peace research villages worldwide of a large enough size and complexity in which peace is established in all its aspects are enough to create cultural healing on a global level. > ‚ÄúWhat will determine the success of such peace projects is not how big and > strong they are (compared to the existing apparatus of violence), but how > comprehensive and complex they are, and how many elements of life they > combine and unite in a positive way. When establishing new fields in > evolution, it is not the law of the strongest, but the success of the more > comprehensive that is the determining factor. Otherwise, no new developments > could be made, for when they begin they are all small and > inconspicuous.\\"Dieter Duhm: Future Without War: Theory of Global Healing. > (2007) Verlag Meiga The political goal of Tamera and its cooperation partners worldwide is to create several such centers on earth, which they call ‚Äúthe plan of the healing biotopes.‚Äù  Projects  Tamera serves as the headquarters for a number of different and independent projects that, when brought together properly, they believe can establish a new social model and a new culture of peace. They include the Global Campus, Monte Cerro Peace Education, the GRACE Foundation, the Institute for Global Peacework, Verlag Meiga Publishing Company, the Children's Center, the Love School, the SolarVillage, the Permaculture Project, the Horse Project, the Seminar and Guest Center and the Terra Nova movement.  The Global Campus  The Global Campus is a worldwide educational initiative designed to offer knowledge in community development as well as the basic principles of decentralized energy supply, architecture, and ecology required to establish autonomous peace villages. Tamera is the home of the first phase of the Global Campus ‚Äì the Monte Cerro Peace Education ‚Äì and is cooperating with the San Jos√© de Apartad√≥ Peace Village in Colombia and the Holy Land Trust in Palestine to establish similar educational centers around the world.  Monte Cerro Peace education  ‚ÄúMonte Cerro Peace Education\\" is a three-year course of studies for a comprehensive understanding for the development of globally effective peace villages. More than one hundred students have enrolled since \\"Monte Cerro\\" opened on 1 May 2006, and in April 2009 the first class will graduate.  GRACE Foundation  The GRACE Foundation was established in 2007, founded by Sabine Lichtenfels, to direct and attract money towards peace projects in an attempt to offset the large amounts of money now being directed into war and war industries. With the motto, \\"A peace village instead of a tank,\\" the Foundation mainly finances peace actions and peace education which are connected to the power of grace. > ‚ÄúGRACE follows the realization that we can only create as much peace outside > ourselves as we have created inside ourselves. GRACE reminds us that the > healing of our planet can only succeed if humanity succeeds in connecting > itself with the true basis of life and love, trust and truth; and humanity > will only succeed if we personally succeed. GRACE embraces the commitment > not to aggravate personal and political conflicts, but to create new > possibilities for solutions.\\"GRACE: Pilgrimage for a Future without War. > (2007) Verlag Meiga  The Institute for Global Peacework (IGP)  The Institute for Global Peacework is a network of peaceworkers and peace initiatives around the world who want to cooperate to create a nonviolent future. It coordinates all the different projects in Tamera and serves as the ‚Äúbase camp‚Äù for all external activities. It also hosts an annual ‚ÄúSummer University‚Äù that brings these different people and projects together in a ‚Äúthink tank.‚Äù  Verlag Meiga Publishing Company  Verlag Meiga publishes books, literature, and essential thoughts to disseminate the knowledge and experience of over thirty years of research into the development of the ‚Äúplan of the healing biotopes.‚Äù Its main headquarters is in (Germany), with a branch in Tamera.  The Children‚Äôs Center  The basic principle of the work with children in Tamera is the ‚Äúeducation of perception.‚Äù In addition to languages, math, biology, and geography, the main emphasis in learning is placed on studies in community development, art, cosmology, international networking, and how to be a spiritual being in the world.  The Love School  One core tenet of the Tamera theory is that a nonviolent culture will essentially depend on whether we succeed in ending the war between the genders. Love without jealousy, sexuality without fear, faithfulness that is not broken when one loves and desires others, truth and longevity in love, and new pathways in partnerships are the focus of the ‚ÄúLove School.‚Äù > ‚ÄúThere cannot be peace between nations as long as there is war between man > and woman.‚Äù  The SolarVillage  The ‚ÄúSolarVillage‚Äù is a test site in Tamera creating a model village that will be self-sufficient in energy and food production enough for fifty people. It can be built without any assistance from the big energy companies. Ecology, technology, architecture, and community are combined in a holistic pilot project designed and monitored by physicist and inventor J√ºrgen Kleinw√§chter. With the energy produced by a system of lenses within a greenhouse and stored in a hot oil system, round-the-clock cooking is available. Power and electricity can also be produced by means of sun-powered pulses of the low-temperature Stirling engine. Even in a hot climate, vegetables and other useful plants flourish and grow very well under light filtered by these lenses. The lake in front of the Monte Cerro campusLake 1 of the Rainwater harvesting landscape in Tamera, Portugal  The Permaculture Project  Since Tamera was founded, an ecological team has made ponds and oases, and planted about 20,000 trees. Sepp Holzer, Austrian mountain farmer known throughout Europe as the \\"Agro-Rebel,\\" is cooperating with Tamera to build a sustainable \\"lakescape\\" in the dry Alentejo region of Portugal, surrounded by a self-sufficient edible landscape with trees, gardens, and wetlands.  The Horse Project  The basis of working with horses in Tamera is to develop a new way of cooperation between human and horse, to promote inner growth, and to increase the ability to be in intimate contact with animals. The horses are ridden without bits or saddles, which requires trust and sensitive communication. The Horse Project is now expanding to offer first-aid treatment for sick, injured, or abused animals, and developing an Animal Sanctuary.  Seminar and Guest Center  The Seminar and Guest Center offers visitors the possibility to get to know Tamera, its grounds, and its research activities. The Center includes the Tamera Guesthouse, visitor's cabins and community tents, as well as the International Youth Cultural Center; and its activities include courses and seminars, Information Weeks, the Summer University, and Open Sundays.  Terra Nova movement  Terra Nova is the global platform that has arisen from the ideas of Dieter Duhm and Sabine Lichtenfels and from the real experience of Tamera. Terra Nova aims to create the conditions for a global system change for a nonviolent Earth, through activism, education and networking and by spreading perspectives for profoundly nonviolent culture based on trust and cooperation.Terra Nova In 2015, Dieter Duhm wrote the book Terra Nova: Global Revolution and the Healing of Love to expound upon and clarify the basic ideas of the movement.Terra Nova book  Art and Music  In many intensive courses and community encounters throughout the history of the Tamera project, art was discovered to be a creative principle of Creation and became an essential element for the inner development of community. In addition to painting, \\"art\\" in Tamera now includes music, theater, dance, landscape art, and artistic expression in language. For example, there is a Tamera Chorus as well as a small a cappella jazz group called the \\"MoonRiders.\\" The straw bale and clay Great Hall  Architecture  Tamera has created experimental buildings as models for the construction of peace villages, designed by various architects such as Gernot Minke, professor of Clay Architecture at the University of Kassel, Germany. Designer Martin Pietsch of Tamera has developed \\"Shade Creations\\" which have been used not only in Tamera but in quite a number of light-roof pavilions in other locations. The Great Hall in Tamera is a meeting place for up to 300 people. It is a wood-frame, straw bale, clay, and green roof construction. With its harmonic interior structure, it is the largest straw bale and clay building on the Iberian Peninsula.  Spirituality  In Tamera, spirituality and religion are not questions of some profession of faith or creed, but of a clear perception, openness, and connection with universal forces in daily life. The core community gathers together every morning and every afternoon in the \\"Political Ashram\\" to focus on attunement and connection through spiritual lectures. There is also a stone circle in Tamera made up of more than sixty monoliths, created and arranged by Sabine Lichtenfels in cooperation with Marko Pogacnik and Peter Frank, that serves as a place of meditation and power.

It is owned and operated by the Cape Ann Museum, whose headquarters is located at 27 Pleasant Street in Gloucester. History The White‚ÄìEllery House was erected in 1710 upon what was then the Town Green of Gloucester. It was built at the edge of a marsh for Gloucester's first settled minister, the Reverend John White (1677‚Äì1760). In keeping with White's esteemed position in the community, the House exhibits a certain elegance and refinement, perhaps best reflected in the surviving interior details. In 1735, the house was purchased by James Stevens and kept as a tavern, sometimes serving as a meeting place for the town's selectmen. In 1740, Captain William Ellery (1693‚Äì1771) took title to the property. Ellery, who was almost 50 years old, had just married for the second time and after keeping the tavern in operation for a few years, used the house as a home for his growing family. Ellery was a slave ship captain, notably navigating the slave ship Jenny in 1758 http://www.slavevoyages.org/voyage/25671/variables on behalf of Merchant Timothy Fitch. Ellery also navigated the snow (type of ship) Caesar on behalf of Fitch http://www.medfordhistorical.org/collections/slave-trade- letters/voyage-one-capt-william-ellery-behalf-timothy-fitch/ Over the next 200 years, six generations of the Ellery family lived in the house. At the most basic level, the house tells the story of an ordinary, middle-class New England family who worked hard to provide for themselves and to raise their children, who witnessed and often took part in events of local and national importance, and who sought to preserve their legacy in the face of an ever- changing world. At a broader level, the house serves as a rare and thought- provoking venue for students of all ages to explore the evolution of New England architecture and to better understand how changing tastes and housing needs affected one particular structure. In 1947 the structure was moved approximately 100 yards from its original location, roughly centered on the rotary, to its present position immediately north of the Babson-Alling house to make room for Route 128. Although the center of Gloucester long ago moved from the Town Green to the Harbor Village, the site remains the entrance to Gloucester and an important historical site.Babson, John J. (1972).

Architecture White‚ÄìEllery House, 1886 The White‚ÄìEllery House is one of just a few First Period (c. 1620‚Äì1725) houses in eastern Massachusetts that survives intact to this day. It is a 2 ¬Ω story \\"saltbox\\" structure with a massive central chimney that once serviced six fireplaces. The building has vertical plank frame construction with an integral lean-to roof. There is a framed overhang on the front fa√ßade and rare examples of raised-field paneled doors between rooms on the first floor. The Renaissance-inspired architectural features illustrate the transition from European building traditions to early American ones. Inside there are several examples of early decorative detail, including three different examples of painted wall decoration, elaborate chamfering (decorative plane work) on ceiling beams and one of the most highly developed front staircases of the period in eastern Massachusetts.Cummings, Abbott Lowell.

It is mostly spread along Lowell Street (Massachusetts Route 133) on either side of a major intersection with four other roads: Shawsheen Road, Reservation Road, Beacon Street, and High Plain Road. The centerpiece of the district is the 1826 West Parish Church, which is the oldest church standing in Andover. It is an elegant Federal style granite structure topped with a wooden steeple, added in 1863. The roof is made of Spanish tile, which was probably part of changes made around 1908. Opposite the church on the south side of the common is the West Parish Cemetery, which began as a small burying ground in the 1790s, and was substantially enlarged and restyled (including the addition of the large arch at its main entrance) in the early 1900s. In addition to the church, common, and cemetery, a number of period houses line Lowell Street and the nearby streets. Most of them were built between 1780 and 1830, and are in Federal or Greek Revival styles. One notable exception is the C. A. Holt House at 202 Shawsheen Road, which is a fine Queen Anne style Victorian.

Under his stewardship, Zahira College became one of the leading schools in the country. Jayah emerged as a leader of the Muslim community of the country. He entered the politics and became a prominent figure in pre-independence politics of Sri Lanka. He was elected to the legislative council, state council and parliament. He was also a founding member of the United National Party. He became the minister of Labour and Social Service in the first independent government of Sri Lanka. After retiring form politics, Jayah was appointed as the first High Commissioner for Ceylon in Pakistan. He died in 1960, falling ill on pilgrimage to Mecca. Early life Tuan Burhanudeen Jayah was born in Galagedara on 1 January 1890, as the son of Nona and Cassim Jayah. The Jayah family belonged to Malay ethnic minority group in Sri Lanka.Careem, Tuan M. Zameer (2017). Persaudaraan (Brotherhood). Malay Life in Sri Lanka (2nd ed). Colombo: S Godage & Brothers. Print Cassim Jayah was employed in the police department as a sergeant.Dr. T.B. Jayah - A National HeroAlhaj Dr. T.B. Jayah And National Unity Early Education When Jayah was young, his family moved to Kurunegala due to his father's transfer. He attended his first school was the Anglo-Vernacular School in Kurunegala. During this period, he also received his Quranic Education under the tutelage of Noordeen Alim and Omarlebbe. Cassim was once again transferred, this time to Colombo. Jayah attended the St. Paul‚Äôs College, Kandy, where he received most of his primary education. He had to be enrolled to Grade 1 at the age of ten. However, the young student was found to be so brilliant that he was awarded a treble promotion from Grade 1 to Grade 4 and once again a double promotion to Grade 6 in the following year. In 1904, he obtained a scholarship to S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia for his secondary education. He passed Cambridge Junior and Cambridge Senior examinations with merits. School Teacher Jayah passed London Matriculation and Inter Arts Examinations which helped him to become a school teacher. He obtained his first appointment at Dharmaraja College, Kandy in January 1910. His first monthly salary was Rs. 40. After a short term at Dharmaraja College, he moved to the Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa in May 1910. In 1917, he shifted to Ananda College, Colombo after accepting an invitation from P. D. S. Kularatne, who was the principal at that time. Jayah mainly taught History and Classics at school. At Ananda College he taught some students who became leading Marxist politicians of the country several years later: Philip Gunawardena, Robert Gunawardena, Dr. S. A. Wickramasinghe and Dr. N. M. Perera.Dr. T.B. Jayah: possessing monumental patience, he loved humanity While being a teacher, he continued his academic pursuit and obtained a degree in Classics from the University of London. Then he enrolled at Law College to become a lawyer. Zahira College While studying in the final year in the Law College, in 1921, Jayah assumed duties as the principal of Zahira College, Colombo, accepting an invitation by the local Muslim community. The actual invitation was made by N H M Abdul Cader, on behalf of the Maradana Mosque Committee. Jayah gave up his future career as a lawyer and decided to remain in the education sector, where he seemed to believe that he can make a valuable contribution to his community. When Jayah assumed duties, Zahira College was in a poor state with few students and teachers, lack of buildings to house class rooms, lack of furniture, and surroundings that were not suitable for a school. Jayah made some significant achievements during his tenure as the principal. He started the classes up to Matriculation level; increased the number of teachers from 6 to 30; expanded the sport facilities; opened a science library, a canteen, a hostel, a dental clinic and a free night school. (The night school he opened up is considered as the first of its kind in the country.) Also, he started funds such as \\"College Extension Fund\\" to develop infrastructure such as buildings. The number of students climbed up from 59 to over 1,000 within four years. Jayah served 27 years as the principal of Zahira College until his retirement in 1948. Jayah's tenure as the principal is generally considered as the golden age of the Zahira College. During this era, the school produced some prominent figures at national level. Branches Jayah was instrumental in opening up several branches of Zahira College. In 1942, the first branch was opened in Aluthgama, followed by the Gampola branch in 1944. Three other branches were opened in 1945 in Matale, Puttalam and Slave Island. Muslim Leadership Jayah gradually emerged as a leader of the Muslim community of the country. After the demise of N H M Abdul Cader, Jayah was appointed as the president of the All Ceylon Muslim League. He continued as the president until 1950. Political career=Legislative Council In 1924, for the first time in the history, an election was held to select members for the Legislative Council from Mohammedan (Muslim) electorate. The Mohammedan electorate was an island-wide communal electorate which represented the Muslim community of the whole country. However, only a limited number of citizens had the voting rights during this time period. Jayah was elected for the Legislative Council along with two others from this electorate. State Council In 1931, after the Donoughmore Constitution, all adult citizens of the country were granted voting rights to elect members for the State Council. Jayah contested for the Colombo Central electorate, but was defeated by a prominent politician, the Ceylon Labour Party leader, A.E. Goonesinha. He was again defeated by the same opponent in 1936 election. However, despite his defeat, he was nominated to the state council, in 1936, and he continued as a member until 1947. In the state council, Jayah was selected to the executive committee of education. This gave him a wide scope to advance Muslim education in the country. He, along with his fellow Muslim state council member Sir Razik Fareed, established many Muslim schools around the island. Also, Jayah fought for the rights of the school teachers. He was largely responsible for establishing the pension scheme for school teachers. In the state council, Jayah and other state council members, who were from ethnic groups other than Sinhala, formed a \\"minority group\\". They were particularly concerned about the rights of Tamil and Muslim people of the country. However, the \\"fifty-fifty\\" campaign carried out by one Tamil state council member G.G.Ponnambalam, was not supported by all of the members in this minority group. United National Party Jayah was instrumental in founding the United National Party. In the inaugural meeting held at Palmcourt, Albert Crescent, Colombo on 6 September 1946, Jayah seconded the proposal made by S. Natesan to unite several political fronts as a single party. The party was formed by uniting the National Congress, the Sinhala Maha Sabha, the All Ceylon Muslim League which was under the leadership of Jayah, the Moors Association which was under the leadership of Sir Razik Fareed, and some individual members of the Tamil and Burgher communities. Jayah was elected as one of five vice-chairmans of the party in this inaugural meeting.\\"The Minutes of the inaugural meeting - 6th September 1946\\" Parliament and Cabinet Cabinet of Ceylon in 1947 In 1947 parliamentary election, the Colombo Central electorate was made a multi-member electorate in order to get a balanced representation of the several communities that exist in the electorate. A.E. Goonesinha obtained 23,470 votes and was elected as the first member. Jayah was elected as the second member obtaining 18,439 votes. Jayah was also selected for the first cabinet of the independent Ceylon, which consisted of only 14 members. He was appointed as the minister of Labour and Social Service. In 1950, Jayah resigned from the house of representatives and from his post as the cabinet minister to assume duties as the first high commissioner to Pakistan. He served seven years in this post. Death Jayah died in 1960, falling ill on pilgrimage to Mecca in Medina.

Gold lamella from Hipponion, unrolled 4th century BC gold orphic tablet from the Getty Museum, Los Angeles Totenpass (plural Totenp√§sse) is a German term sometimes used for inscribed tablets or metal leaves found in burials primarily of those presumed to be initiates into Orphic, Dionysiac, and some ancient Egyptian and Semitic religions. The term may be understood in English as a \\"passport for the dead\\".Roy Kotansky, \\"Incantations and Prayers for Salvation on Inscribed Greek Amulets\\", in Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion, edited by Christopher A. Faraone and Dirk Obbink (Oxford University Press, 1991), p.116. The so-called Orphic gold tablets are perhaps the best-known example. Totenp√§sse are placed on or near the body as a phylactery, or rolled and inserted into a capsule often worn around the neck as an amulet. The inscription instructs the initiate on how to navigate the afterlife, including directions for avoiding hazards in the landscape of the dead and formulaic responses to the underworld judges. Examples The Getty Museum owns an outstanding example of a 4th-century BC Orphic prayer sheet from Thessaly, a gold-leaf rectangle measuring about .As of September 17, 2008, The Getty Villa Malibu had this Orphic lamella on exhibition; information about the piece online. The burial site of a woman also in Thessaly and dating to the late 4thcentury BC yielded a pair of Totenp√§sse in the form of lamellae (Latin, \\"thin metal sheets\\", singular lamella). Although the term \\"leaf\\" to describe metal foil is a modern metaphorical usage,Daniel Ogden, Greek and Roman Necromancy (Princeton University Press, 2001), p. 188. these lamellae were in this case cut in the shape of cordate leaves probably meant to represent ivy; most Totenp√§sse of this type are rectangular. The Greek lettering is not inscribed in regular lines as it is on the rectangular tablets, but rambles to fit the shape. The leaves are paper-thin and small, one measuring and the other . They had been arranged symmetrically on the woman's chest, with her lips sealed by a gold danake, or \\"Charon's obol\\", the coin that pays the ferryman of the dead for passage; this particular coin depicted the head of a Gorgon. Also placed in the tomb was a terracotta figurine of a maenad, one of the ecstatic women in the retinue of Dionysus.K. Tasntsanoglou and George M. Par√°ssoglou, \\"Two Gold Lamellae from Thessaly\\", Hellenica 38 (1987), pp.3‚Äì5. Although the meandering and fragile text poses difficulties, the inscriptions appear to speak of the unity of life and death and of rebirth, possibly in divine form. The deceased is supposed to stand before Persephone, Queen of the Dead, and assert \\"I have been released by Bacchios himself.\\"K. Tasntsanoglou and George M. Par√°ssoglou, \\"Two Gold Lamellae from Thessaly\\", Hellenica 38 (1987) 3‚Äì16, with photographic plates and line drawings. Interpretation G√ºnther Zuntz made the most complete survey of gold tablets discovered up to 1971 (at Thurii, Crete, and elsewhere), categorizing them into three groups that have become the typological standard. Zuntz presented transcribed text coupled with a reconstruction, and interpreted their religious foundation as Pythagorean rather than Orphic.G√ºnther Zuntz, \\"The Gold Leaves\\", in Persephone: Three Essays on Religion and Thought in Magna Graecia (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971); review by Joseph Fontenrose, Classical Philology 69 (1974) 60‚Äì63. Philologist Richard Janko proposed that GroupB from Zuntz's collection derived from a single archetype, for which he offered a hypothetical Greek text and the following English translation while attempting, he emphasized, not to rely on preconceptions about underlying theology:On the problematic relation between grave goods and eschatology, see Ian Morris, Death-ritual and Social Structure in Classical Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 1992) pp. 17‚Äì18. Mnemosyne (1881), a pre-Raphaelite interpretation of the goddess Memory by Dante Gabriel Rossetti The most widely available source that discusses the Orphic gold tablets is the classic (if superseded in some aspects) Orpheus and Greek Religion by W. K. C. Guthrie.W.K.C. Guthrie, Orpheus and Greek Religion: A Study of the Orphic Movement (New York: Norton, 1966, revised edition), pp. 171‚Äì182. Since the 1990s, the usefulness of the term \\"Orphic\\" has been questioned by scholars, as has the unity of religious belief underlying the gold tablets.Radcliffe G. Edmonds, III, Myths of the Underworld Journey: Plato, Aristophanes, and the 'Orphic' Gold Tablets (Cambridge University Press, 2004), limited preview here. More recently the association of the tablets with Orphism has been defended.Bernab√©, Alberto, and Ana Isabel Jim√©nez San Crist√≥bal. Instructions for the Netherworld: The Orphic Gold Tablets. Boston: Brill, 2008: pp.204‚Äî205. Totenp√§sse have also been found in tombs from Palestine dating from the 2ndcentury BC and later. These tiny gold sheets employ a formulaic consolation that appears regularly on funerary steles in the area: , (here the name of the deceased is inserted), (\\"Take courage, [name], no one is immortal). In one instance, the inscribed tablet was shaped like a funerary headband, with holes to bind it around the forehead.Roy Kotansky, \\"Incantations and Prayers for Salvation on Inscribed Greek Amulets: The Magic Lamellae,\\" in Magika Hiera (Oxford University Press, 1991), p.116; David R.

The riot was one of the most serious incidents between African-American and European-American military personnel in the United States Armed Forces during World War II.  Background  3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines enter the ruins of Agana, July 1944 In July 1944, the 3rd Marine Division and 77th Infantry Division sought to recapture Guam from the Japanese Army in a military campaign that cost 1,783 American lives and wounded 6,010 men.Rottman, G. (2004). Guam 1941 & 1944: Loss and Reconquest, Oxford: Osprey Publishing. , p. 86. After the battle, the Allies developed Guam as a base of operations. Five large airfields were built by Seabees. B-29 bombers were flown from the island to attack targets in the western Pacific and mainland Japan. Guam continued as a station for the 3rd Marine Division. Racial tensions heightened in late August when the African American Marine 25th Depot Company arrived to start loading operations at the newly constructed naval supply depot. European Americans of the 3rd Marine Division, some new to the area, tried to prevent African American Marines from visiting nearby Agana and its women.Bernard C. Nalty. \\"The Right to Fight: African-American Marines in World War II\\", United States Marine Corps Historical Center, National Park Service Over the next three months, racially motivated incidents and a pervasive pattern of discrimination caused tensions to rise between the two groups. A European American sailor shot and killed a \\"black Marine of the 25th Depot Company in a quarrel over a woman; and a sentry from the 27th Marine Depot Company reacted to harassment by fatally wounding his tormentor, a white Marine.\\" Each of these men was eventually court-martialed for voluntary manslaughter. A race riot erupted on Christmas Eve 1944 when rumors spread that another African American sailor had been shot and killed by a European American Marine.  First confrontation  On December 24, a group of nine African American Marines from the 25th Depot Company had been given 24-hour holiday passes (for exemplary service) to go into Agana, Guam. While they were in the city, white Marines opened fire on the men when they saw them talking to Chamoru women. The black Marines escaped and eight returned safely to their depot, but one was missing. In response, 40 black enlisted men loaded into two trucks and drove back to Agana to find the missing man. At the same time, an African American Marine‚Äîwho remained at the base‚Äîcalled the military police, warning them that the black Marines were on their way. The MPs proceeded to erect barricades across all the roads leading into Agana. When the trucks arrived at a roadblock, a standoff began. Eventually, tensions were calmed after a military police officer informed the black Marines that the missing man was found safe and returned to the 25th's camp. Satisfied, they turned their trucks around and returned to base. Around midnight on Christmas morning, a truck filled with armed European American Marines drove into the segregated African American camp, and claimed that one of their Marines had been hit with a piece of coral thrown by someone from that camp. The standoff ended after the depot's commanding officer ordered the European American Marines to leave.  Escalation  Racial tensions continued on Christmas Day when an African- American enlisted man walking back to camp from Agana was shot dead by two drunk white Marines. Within hours, another black enlisted man was shot and killed by another drunken white enlisted man in Agana. Reports of the shootings reached the African-American company. After midnight on the early morning of 26 December, a jeep with white service members opened fire on the African-American depot. Camp guards returned fire, injuring a white MP officer. The whites in the jeep took cover and fled toward Agana, chased by a group of armed blacks. The black Marines were stopped by white MPs at a roadblock outside Agana. They were arrested and charged with unlawful assembly, rioting, theft of government property, and attempted murder.  Aftermath  Major General Henry Louis Larsen convened a court of inquiry to investigate the riot. Walter Francis White, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), was in Guam and participated in fact-finding during the investigation. He learned of the pervasive discrimination and harassment directed against the black troops and testified to these incidents. Forty-three Marines were court-martialed, convicted and received prison terms of several years. Because of White's work, some white Marines were also charged and convicted for their part in the disturbances. The NAACP later successfully campaigned with the Department of the Navy and, ultimately, the White House, to have the black Marines' guilty verdicts overturned, and they were released from prison in 1946.

Mathematically the model is as follows: : \\\\mathit T = \\\\mathit g + \\\\frac{\\\\mathit ROE - \\\\mathit g} {\\\\mathit PB} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta PB}{PB} \\\\mathit(1 + g) ::where T = total return from the stock over a period (appreciation + \\"distribution yield\\" ‚Äî see below); ::g = the growth rate of the company's book value during the period; ::PB = the ratio of price / book value at the beginning of the period. ::ROE = the company's return on equity, i.e. earnings during the period / book value; Use When ex post values for growth, price/book, etc. are plugged in, the T-Model gives a close approximation of actually realized stock returns. Unlike some proposed valuation formulas, it has the advantage of being correct in a mathematical sense (see derivation); however, this by no means guarantees that it will be a successful stock- picking tool.Dwyer, Hubert and Richard Lynn, \\"Is The Estep T-Model Consistently Useful?\\" Financial Analysts Journal, November/December 1992, Vol. 48, No. 6: 82‚Äì86. Still, it has advantages over commonly used fundamental valuation techniques such as price‚Äìearnings or the simplified dividend discount model: it is mathematically complete, and each connection between company fundamentals and stock performance is explicit, so that the user can see where simplifying assumptions have been made. Some of the practical difficulties involved with financial forecasts stem from the many vicissitudes possible in the calculation of earnings, the numerator in the ROE term. With an eye toward making forecasting more robust, in 2003 Estep published a version of the T-Model driven by cash items: cash flow, gross assets and total liabilities. Note that all \\"fundamental valuation methods\\" differ from economic models such as the capital asset pricing model and its various descendants; fundamental models attempt to forecast return from a company's expected future financial performance, whereas CAPM-type models regard expected return as the sum of a risk-free rate plus a premium for exposure to return variability. Derivation The return a shareholder receives from owning a stock is: (2) \\\\mathit T = \\\\frac{\\\\mathit D} {\\\\mathit P} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta P}{P} Where \\\\mathit P = beginning stock price, \\\\Delta P = price appreciation or decline, and \\\\mathit D = distributions, i.e. dividends plus or minus the cash effect of company share issuance/buybacks. Consider a company whose sales and profits are growing at rate g. The company funds its growth by investing in plant and equipment and working capital so that its asset base also grows at g, and debt/equity ratio is held constant, so that net worth grows at g. Then the amount of earnings retained for reinvestment will have to be gBV. After paying dividends, there may be an excess: \\\\mathit XCF = \\\\mathit E - \\\\mathit Div - \\\\mathit gBV \\\\, where XCF = excess cash flow, E = earnings, Div = dividends, and BV = book value. The company may have money left over after paying dividends and financing growth, or it may have a shortfall. In other words, XCF may be positive (company has money with which it can repurchase shares) or negative (company must issue shares). Assume that the company buys or sells shares in accordance with its XCF, and that a shareholder sells or buys enough shares to maintain her proportionate holding of the company's stock. Then the portion of total return due to distributions can be written as \\\\frac{\\\\mathit Div} {\\\\mathit P} + \\\\frac{\\\\mathit XCF} {\\\\mathit P} . Since \\\\mathit ROE = \\\\frac{\\\\mathit E} {\\\\mathit BV} and \\\\mathit PB = \\\\frac{\\\\mathit P} {\\\\mathit BV} this simplifies to: (3) \\\\frac{\\\\mathit D} {\\\\mathit P} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathit ROE - \\\\mathit g} {\\\\mathit PB} Now we need a way to write the other portion of return, that due to price change, in terms of PB. For notational clarity, temporarily replace PB with A and BV with B. Then P \\\\equiv AB. We can write changes in P as: \\\\mathit P + \\\\Delta \\\\mathit P = (\\\\mathit A + \\\\Delta \\\\mathit A ) ( \\\\mathit B + \\\\Delta \\\\mathit B ) \\\\, = \\\\mathit AB + \\\\mathit B \\\\Delta \\\\mathit A + \\\\mathit A \\\\Delta \\\\mathit B + \\\\Delta \\\\mathit A \\\\Delta \\\\mathit B \\\\, Subtracting P \\\\equiv AB from both sides and then dividing by P \\\\equiv AB, we get: \\\\frac{\\\\Delta P}{P} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\mathit B}{\\\\mathit B} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\mathit A}{\\\\mathit A} \\\\left ( \\\\mathit 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\mathit B}{\\\\mathit B} \\\\right ) A is PB; moreover, we recognize that \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\mathit B}{\\\\mathit B} = \\\\mathit g , so it turns out that: (4) \\\\frac{\\\\Delta P}{P} = \\\\mathit g + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta PB}{PB} \\\\mathit(1 + g) Substituting (3) and (4) into (2) gives (1), the T-Model. The cash-flow T-model In 2003 Estep published a version of the T-model that does not rely on estimates of return on equity, but rather is driven by cash items: cash flow from the income statement, and asset and liability accounts from the balance sheet. The cash-flow T-model is: \\\\mathit T = \\\\frac {\\\\mathit CF}{\\\\mathit P} + \\\\boldsymbol {\\\\Phi} g + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta PB}{PB} \\\\mathit(1 + g) where \\\\mathit CF = cash flow \\\\, \\\\mbox{(net income + depreciation + all other non-cash charges),} \\\\, and \\\\boldsymbol {\\\\Phi} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathit MktCap - gross assets + total liabilities}{\\\\mathit MktCap} He provided a proof Estep, Preston, \\"Cash Flows, Asset Values, and Investment Returns\\", The Journal of Portfolio Management, Spring 2003 that this model is mathematically identical to the original T-model, and gives identical results under certain simplifying assumptions about the accounting used. In practice, when used as a practical forecasting tool it may be preferable to the standard T-model, because the specific accounting items used as input values are generally more robust (that is, less susceptible to variation due to differences in accounting methods), hence possibly easier to estimate. Relationship to other valuation models Some familiar valuation formulas and techniques can be understood as simplified cases of the T-model. For example, consider the case of a stock selling exactly at book value (PB = 1) at the beginning and end of the holding period. The third term of the T-Model becomes zero, and the remaining terms simplify to: \\\\mathit T = \\\\mathit g + \\\\frac{\\\\mathit ROE - \\\\mathit g} {1} = ROE Since \\\\mathit ROE = \\\\frac{\\\\mathit E}{\\\\mathit BV} and we are assuming in this case that \\\\mathit BV = \\\\mathit P \\\\,, \\\\mathit T = \\\\frac{\\\\mathit E}{\\\\mathit P} , the familiar earnings yield. In other words, earnings yield would be a correct estimate of expected return for a stock that always sells at its book value; in that case, the expected return would also equal the company's ROE. Consider the case of a company that pays the portion of earnings not required to finance growth, or put another way, growth equals the reinvestment rate 1 ‚Äì D/E. Then if PB doesn't change: \\\\mathit T = \\\\mathit g + \\\\frac{\\\\mathit ROE - \\\\mathit ROE (1 - D/E)} {\\\\mathit PB} Substituting E/BV for ROE, this turns into: \\\\mathit T = \\\\mathit g + \\\\frac{D} {\\\\mathit P} This is the standard Gordon \\"yield plus growth\\" model. It will be a correct estimate of T if PB does not change and the company grows at its reinvestment rate. If PB is constant, the familiar price‚Äìearnings ratio can be written as: \\\\frac{\\\\mathit P}{\\\\mathit E} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathit ROE - \\\\mathit g}{\\\\mathit ROE (\\\\mathit T - \\\\mathit g)} From this relationship we recognize immediately that P‚ÄìE cannot be related to growth by a simple rule of thumb such as the so-called \\"PEG ratio\\" \\\\frac{\\\\mathit P/E}{g} ; it also depends on ROE and the required return, T. The T-model is also closely related to the P/B-ROE model of WilcoxWilcox, Jarrod W., \\"The P/B-ROE Valuation Model,\\" Financial Analysts Journal, Jan‚ÄìFeb 1984, pp 58‚Äì66.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof and clapboard siding. Door and window trim is very simple, and there is a slight overhang of the second floor over the first. The house appears to have been formed out of two separate structures, that were, based on stylistic analysis, joined in about 1720. The left side of the house was probably built sometime between 1690 and 1700, but may be even older. In an unusual twist to this type of joinery, the older portion's chimney was taken down and a new one was apparently built in the framing of the newer section. The interior exhibits primarily later Federal period woodwork, but there are some examples of c. 1720 paneling. The house was moved to its present location in 1915. Its original location was on a farm owned by Robert Prince, who left the property to his wife Sarah in trust for their children. Sarah remarried, to Alexander Osborne, an indentured servant. She died in prison in 1692 while awaiting trial as a witch during the Salem witch hysteria. The Princes and Osbornes fought a legal battle over the estate, complicating the dating of the house. The older portion of the house appears to have been standing by 1696, when mention is made of it in a partial settlement of the dispute.

Description and history The city of Peabody was originally part of Salem, and was, after a series of political divisions, incorporated separately as South Danvers in 1855. It was renamed Peabody, after philanthropist George Peabody, in 1868, and was reincorporated as a city in 1911. What is now Washington Street was laid out in 1750 as part of a new post road between Salem and Boston, running east-west along what is now Main Street, but turning south before reaching Peabody Square. The corner was the site of an 18th-century tavern, and houses and small businesses began to line the street. The oldest surviving house on Washington Street is the 1810 Gen. Gideon Foster House, now a local museum. Another early 19th-century house is that of Abel Proctor (c. 1830), a Federal period house built for a tannery owner. The district is also home to the 1836 United Methodist Church; one of the district's few non-residential buildings, it was moved here from Peabody Square in 1843. The historic district is bounded on the north by Main Street, and extends south along Washington Street to Aborn Street. It also includes a cluster of similar period buildings on Sewall Street and Holten Street, the latter running parallel to and east of Washington Street. The district is characterized by uniform setbacks on each street (larger on Washington and smaller on the other two streets), with mainly wood-frame houses two or three stories in height.

Life Wardrop was born on 14 August 1782, the youngest son of James Wardrop (1738-1830) and his wife, Marjory Marjoribanks, at Torbane Hill, near Linlithgow, West Lothian, but at four years of age moved with the family to live in Edinburgh where he attended the High School, and then St Andrews University. In 1800 he was apprenticed to a firm of surgeon apothecaries which included his great uncle Andrew Wardrop, former president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and in 1801 was appointed House Surgeon at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He trained in London (1801), Paris and Vienna (1803). He was admitted a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1804. He worked as an ophthalmic surgeon in Edinburgh 1804‚Äì08 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1808, upon the proposal of Andrew Wardrop, Alexander Keith of Dunnottar and James Russell. In 1808 he was sharing a large Georgian house in Edinburgh's First New Town at 4 South Hanover Street.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1808. In 1809, he published an important monograph 'Observations on Fungus Haematodes or Soft Cancer' in which he for the first time described as an entity a pediatric eye cancer now known as retinoblastoma and, unknowingly, a uveal melanoma that he helped to enucleate and that later metastasized to the liver. Soon after, Wardrop moved to London, where he worked as an ophthalmic surgeon from 1809 to 1869. He was awarded his doctorate (MD) by his alma mater, St Andrews University, in 1834. Wardrop taught surgery from 1826 at the Aldersgate Street medical academy with Lawrence and Tyrrell, and published surgical treatises. Wardrop was early appointed Surgeon-in-Ordinary to the Prince Regent. This annoyed his rivals in London, and he found the doors of the large hospitals closed to him. In retaliation he founded the West London Hospital for Surgery near the Edgware Road, and invited general practitioners to watch him operate. Further royal honours came, but he declined a baronetcy (in lieu of royal fees) and moved out of royal circles. His social gifts, a knowledge of horses and marriage to a wife with aristocratic connections brought him popularity.Brook C. 1945. Battling surgeon. Strickland Press, Glasgow. p36 Wardrop was associated with Thomas Wakley in the founding of The Lancet in 1823, for which he first wrote savage articles and, later, witty and scurrilous lampoons in his column 'Intercepted Letters'. The letters, under the pseudonym 'Brutus', were thinly disguised as by leading London surgeons, 'accidentally' revealing their nepotism, venality and incompetence. There was enough truth in them to make the parodies sting. He was later rehabilitated with the Royal College of Surgeons of England, becoming a Fellow in 1843.Desmond A. 1989.

The series takes place in the late Qing Dynasty, during the era of the Empress Dowager Cixi. After a convoy accident in which the imperial kitchener perishes, Cixi orders the search for a new kitchener from the region. She sends her eunuchs to a nearby town, where they find a small tavern with a skilled elderly chef - the grandfather of the series protagonist, Fugui, a young aspiring chef himself. His grandfather is taken away by the eunuchs, leaving only one option for Fugui - becoming the imperial kitchener, thereby saving the life of his grandfather. Fugui must train his cooking skills in order to beat all the other cooks trying to become the Dowager's new cook. Fugui eventually finds a friend for life, Feidie, while searching for his grandfather. Feidie helps Fugui in order to get closer to the Dowager, who she wants to assassinate due to her belief that she killed her father. Fugui also befriends a lot of other people with his friendly personality, such as the Guangxu Emperor, whom he nicknames \\"Sprout\\", eunuch Xiao Lizi‚ÄîA greedy man at first, but then changes across the episodes‚Äîdespite him leading the capture of his grandfather at the town tavern, and dispatching Fugui rather harshly during the capture. Over the course of the show, Feidie discovers that the Dowager is actually a relative to hers. Her joy is short- lived, as the Dowager wants her to get married, and Fugui is power less as a villain‚Äîwho has the initial \\"K.\\"(Some audiences think that his prototype is Yuan Shih-kai) who had hired Xiao Lizi before realizes his error and forces his goddaughter to distract Fugui‚Äîmanages to stage an act, landing the emperor into a Solitary Tower; and Fiedie is forced to escape! Fugui sees no point in becoming the imperial chef anymore, because very few days after his grandfather was freed, his grandfather died, and so he wandered off, leading the villain with the initial \\"K.\\" laughing maliciously and the show ending. Miscellaneous Although the show is Chinese, they use simple English at times, such as \\"Yes\\", \\"Ok\\" or \\"No\\". The character Xiao Lizi is a much younger version of Li Lianying, who was a real-life servant of the Empress Dowager Cixi until her death in 1908; Li Lianying died three years later in 1911, at the age of 62. The show is supposed to be in the olden days, but sometimes they have parodies of modern inventions or they sing modern songs at time.

In 2003, Long worked as music assistant to Howard Shore on the film score for The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Long composed the original music for the movie thrillers The Only Hotel and Surveillance 24/7. Early life, education Long was born on 10 April 1974 in Hampshire, England. She began training as a classical pianist at age 4, moving on to also learn clarinet, guitar, cello, vocals, organ, and violin. Long began composing when she entered college. However, frustrated with the progression of her music degree, she claims she spent her entire student loan on a huge sequencer keyboard. She then slowly continued to amass the equipment needed for a fully operational home recording studio. There she independently practised recording, producing, scoring, arranging, and mixing. Career After college Long began working for the BBC on the children's shows Blue Peter and Live & Kicking, where she periodically worked with Ronnie Hazlehurst (composer for Only Fools and Horses), Dennis King of Black Beauty, and Nigel Hess (composer of the film Ladies in Lavender). She has also worked with composers Jerry Goldsmith and Ron Goodwin. She was signed to a major label soon after sending out demos of her material. Long has since written scores, piano pieces, and full orchestrations for many films and television spots. In 2003 Long served as a music score assistant for composer Howard Shore on the historic film trilogy The Lord of the Rings, as well as the extended DVDs. Long, who had met Shore before the films, served essentially as his personal copy editor for the sheet music he wrote daily for new scenes. She was also known on set for reliably supplying brownies and pancakes. She is well known for scoring the often played Volkswagen Passat commercials in 2005. Since 2005 she has scored a large amount of for- television documentaries on Channel 4, Channel 5, the Discovery Channel, and the BBC, including Behind the Da Vinci Code and Open Gardens in 2008. She has also scored several short films and the feature films The Only Hotel and Surveillance (2007).

Solo Releases ;Porcelain (2007) Long released her debut album Porcelain on 24 July 2007 on Warner Classics. The album is a collection of original piano compositions, many in a classically expressive and filmic style. Besides Long on piano, the recording sessions also included musicians Jonathan Hill and Nick Holland. The cello used in the recordings was handmade by Long's father. As of 1 February 2010, Porcelain was the top selling album on America's largest classical radio station, and she secured a sell-out tour of the United States. ;Embers (2010) On 3 May 2010 Long released her second piano album Embers with BLE Music Group. The album quickly became widely requested on worldwide classical radio stations, and was \\"most requested\\" on Classic FM radio. ;Intervention (2012) ;Identity (2016) ; ;Perspective (2018) Awards Long was Radio Classic FM's Guest List Composer in 2007.

A local man, Peter Voisey, a known sex offender, was later convicted of the crime and sentenced to life in prison. The brazen nature of the crime sparked widespread media interest and a Crimewatch appeal. It also sparked the largest ever man-hunt, at the time, by Northumbria Police. Assertions by the police that the crime had been a case of opportunistic abduction from the home by a stranger were initially met with scepticism, given the seemingly unbelievable nature of the crime.BBC News Abduction police faced scepticism, 20 October 2006 Voisey's conviction also sparked a review of the multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), which govern the monitoring of past offenders.  Abduction  The girl was abducted from her ground-floor bath as her mother was in the next-door room. She was driven around the local area for 20 minutes, before being found naked in a snow-covered back alley. Initially, police only had the girl's eyewitness account of a \\"man in a red car\\" identified by her as a Vauxhall Astra, with no other witnesses present. The only forensic evidence the police could obtain was a footprint in the bathroom, and a partial DNA trace from the girl's fingernail. Through careful interview with the girl, it was ascertained from the route she was driven, that the offender had a good knowledge of the local area.  Arrest  Voisey, who was also known as Peter Smith, was originally questioned as part of a wide sweep of local people who might be of interest because he was a registered sex offender. Police were first aware of him as a sneak thief, committing high risk burglaries with a chance of discovery,BBC Crimewatch Solved, 6 August 2008 but in 2001, he had been convicted of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl in a swimming pool changing room in Cheshire.BBC News Review into bath rape man's case, 20 October 2006 He was not initially considered a priority lead, as he had been classified low risk due to good behaviour. Voisey initially appeared good natured, and had a good account of his movements. He continued to strenuously deny any involvement when interviewed further.  Conviction  With no strong evidence, Voisey was convicted from a multitude of lesser clues. This included his local knowledge and his mobile phone records, which proved he was not where he claimed to be at the time. The trainer print had been matched to a pair he owned, only five of which had been sold in the North East that year. He had made a cryptic diary entry for the day in question, \\"Phew it's over, chill now\\", which he claimed referred to Christmas. He had also owned a red Astra, although this was scrapped before it could be seized as evidence. It was also concluded, although a partial match, that there was a high chance of the DNA found being Voisey's.

Bupa‚Äôs rationale was that the scale of both its UK hospitals and insurance businesses meant that they were becoming increasingly constrained by being part of the same group. Significant acquisitions followed. The largest of which was the merger of Bupa‚Äôs insurance business in Australia with the insurance group MBF to form what was then Australia‚Äôs second largest private medical insurer. In 2011, Bupa Australia brought together the insurance brands MBF, HBA and Mutual Community under the Bupa brand. During the 2018-19 financial year, Bupa remained the biggest player in Australia by customer numbers, with almost 3.6 million customers. However, the insurer has experienced losses in Australia - 50,000 net customer losses across all products and almost 80,000 of its core hospital cover customers. Bupa acquired the Amity Group of care homes in Australia in 2007. https://www.agedcareguide.com.au/talking-aged-care/amity-group-to-become-bupa- care-services-in-australia In 2010, Bupa launched a partnership in India with Max India Ltd, branded Max Bupa.url=https://www.maxannualreports.com/maxindia-2018/max-bupa.html In 2016, Bupa increased its ownership of Max Bupa, to 49%.https://www.internationalinvestment.net/internationalinvestment/news/3503728/bupa- boosts-stake-indian-jv-max-bupa-49#:~:text=Bupa%2C%20the%20London- based%20international%20insurance%20and%20healthcare%20company%2C,as%20much%20as%2049%25%20in%20Indian%20insurance%20companies.

Controversies Bupa has been subject to criticism in Australia and the UK regarding alleged cost- cutting and standards in care homes for elderly people. In each country, it receives public sector funding.  United Kingdom  Bupa UK has been criticised by some judges, coroners, the Health & Safety Executive, local authorities and care regulators regarding alleged cost-cutting and evidence of institutional failures in some of its UK residential care homes... Staff and families of residents in some Bupa UK care homes have criticised Bupa for allegedly prioritising profits to the detriment of care. In 1999 seven care workers who reported abuse of residents to Bupa UK senior management became known as the Bupa Seven in Parliamentary and media reports. One of this group was Eileen Chubb, who claimed in a series of reports that Bupa UK had failed to take remedial action on issues reported by staff and relatives of residents, and that staff had reported to the Care Quality Commission that they were afraid to raise concerns. Some UK care workers have claimed that they were forced to leave or were dismissed for raising concerns to Bupa. In 2018 Bupa UK was fined ¬£3,000,000 after a resident died after contracting Legionnaire's disease.  Australia  Bupa's operations in Australia has been the subject of repeated scandal in news media. There are no Bupa aged care homes currently operating under sanctions. Previous allegations made against Bupa include: * Rejecting thousands of insurance claims without doctor review, while falsely telling patients the rejections had been 'determined by medical practitioner'. * Horrific neglect of elderly patients (a cancer patient was found with maggots 'crawling out of his ears').https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/maggots-crawling- out-ears-family-3280810 * Data breaches involving customers of its health plans. * Complaints by the Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck that Bupa had persistently failed to meet regulatory standards. * Misleading and deceptive conduct toward aged care customers, charging them for services that not ultimately delivered to 4,306 residents. * Failure to pay 270 invoices worth an estimated $73,000 to psychologists treating military personnel.

It is believed to be the oldest living cultivated fruit tree in North America. History= Early history  John Endecott, governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was probably among the first to cultivate fruit in the Colony, and imported the Endecott Pear Tree from England. The Endicott Pear Tree was planted in its current location between 1632 and 1649 (William Bentley reports dates of 1630, 1631, and 1639 in his diary) by John Endecott‚Äîa governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, one of the Colony's earliest settlers, and ancestor of Endicott Peabody‚Äîand was probably brought from England on the Arbella in June 1630. Various reports indicate an alternate import year of 1628. Tradition holds to the notion that the tree was planted by Endecott himself, according to Harriet Tapley in Chronicles of Danvers and to Judge Alden Perley White. According to Charles S. Tapley, a President of the Bay State Historical League, White recounted that Endecott personally planted the pear tree in the presence of his children and farmworkers and reportedly declared: \\"I hope the tree will love the soil of the old world and no doubt when we have gone the tree will still be alive.\\" The 1925 USDA Agriculture Yearbook, citing the memoir of Samuel Endicott‚Äîa descendant of Endecott (the spelling of the family name changed in the 18th century)‚Äîsuggests that the tree may have been transplanted from Endecott's garden in Salem. An article in the Salem Observer, written in 1852 by Samuel P. Fowler, lends further credence to this idea, noting that it was in Salem proper that Endecott \\"probably planted his famous pear tree\\". Flower also reports that Endecott was probably among the first to cultivate fruit in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. 19th century The diary of Rev. William Bentley, who visited the Endecott estate (at the time known as Collins Farm and owned by Capt. John Endicott) on several occasions, makes numerous mentions of the Endicott Pear Tree starting in 1800. Bentley's diary confirms that the tree regularly produced fruit. In September 1809, Bentley passed along some pears harvested from the tree to former President John Adams; he received a letter from Adams concerning the pears the following month. On April 11, 1810, Bentley visited Collins Farm to obtain twigs from the pear tree to send to Adams. Thurl D. Brown, in a lecture before the Danvers Historical Society, suggested that \\"[t]he twigs must have taken hold\\", citing a letter from Adams dated September 24, 1815 that noted: \\"The hurricane of yesterday has covered the ground about me with pears.\\" The Endicott Pear Tree was damaged by the Storm of October 1804, a late-season major hurricane in the 1804 Atlantic hurricane season, but recovered to \\"yield many bushels\\" of fruit. The tree was damaged by hurricanes at least twice more in the 19th century: in 1815 and 1843. By 1875, the Endicott Pear Tree stood at approximately . Sometime in the mid-to-late-19th century, a wooden fence was erected to protect the tree. 20th century In the early 20th century, Ulysses Prentiss Hedrick, a botanist and author of The Pears of New York‚Äîa 1921 monograph belonging to a series of publications on fruits, \\"all of which have become classic references on the fruit cultivars of the period\\" ‚Äîconfirmed that the Endicott Pear Tree had not been grafted, as was suggested in an 1837 article about the tree in Mr. Hovey's Magazine. A 1919 account of the Endicott Pear Tree by James Raymond Simmons, author of The Historic Trees of Massachusetts, describes the tree as follows: The Endicott Pear Tree was damaged by a hurricane once more in 1934. In the 1940s, The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry attempted to acquire possession of the tree from its then-owner, a Mr. Simard, who had acquired the property from George Endicott in 1941. This move was prompted by the discovery that Simard had \\"stripped the soil near the tree\\", leaving it exposed. In 1946, at a town meeting, the town of Danvers passed a resolution to \\"accept a plot of land on which the so-called Endicott Pear Tree is located, subject to an agreement drawn by the owner and in form agreeable to the Town Counsel\\"; however, the town did not purchase the tree due to the inability of the Town Counsel, a James H. Sullivan, and Simard to agree on the terms of the acquisition. On January 1, 1947, Sullivan was replaced as Town Counsel, and no further action was taken regarding acquisition of the Endicott Pear Tree. Eventually, Simard deeded the property on which the tree is located to North Shore Industries; it was subsequently transferred to CBS-Hytron, which erected a wooden fence around the pear tree, Matchlett Laboratories, and finally Osram Sylvania. On July 27, 1964, vandals cut off the tree's branches and all but of its trunk using hacksaws. As of August 2002, it was surrounded by a chain-link fence and located near the headquarters of Osram Sylvania in Danvers. In 1997, scions were collected from the Endicott Pear Tree for the pear germplasm collection of the National Clonal Germplasm Repository in Corvallis, Oregon, and a fruit- bearing clone of the tree was grown. Cultural impacts In 2011, the Endicott Pear Tree was named as a national monument of the United States. According to a 2007 article in the Danvers Herald, the Endicott Pear Tree \\"holds a special place in the hearts of many Danversites\\". In 2004, the Danvers Preservation Commission sought to have the tree featured on a stamp of the United States Postal Service. Lucy Larcom composed a poem, titled \\"The Governor's Tree\\", about the Endicott Pear Tree in 1890 for Arbor Day.

The OCI's headquarters is located at the National Sport Center ‚Äì Tel Aviv.  History  In 1933 the Palestine National Olympic Committee was officially formed, and was recognized by the International Olympic Committee in May 1934, despite never competing. Although this committee represented Jews, Christians and Muslims living in Mandatory Palestine, its rules stated that they \\"represent[ed] the Jewish National Home.\\" It was, however, controlled exclusively by Maccabi sports organization and oversaw only clubs affiliated with Maccabi, while neither rival Jewish sports organizations, such as Hapoel, nor non-Jewish sports organizations took part. Although Eretz Israel was formally invited to participate in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, it declined the invitation to attend the Games in Nazi Germany. In 1948, shortly after the State of Israel was established, its request to participate in the 1948 Olympics was denied, as the newly formed country wasn't yet recognized by IOC. OCI recognition The OCI was re- organized in 1951 under joint-leadership of Maccabi and Hapoel, the two major sports organization in the country. According to the agreement of the two organization, there were two presidents, one from each. This arrangement continued until 1967, and since then OCI has only one president. OCI achieved IOC recognition in early 1952, just in time for Israel's Olympic debut at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. OCI has sent delegations to all Summer Olympics since then, except for Moscow 1980, which Israel supported the United States in a boycott over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Israel made its debut at the Winter Olympics in 1994, and has become a regular participant since then.

It was developed by David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, and employed chiefly towards Turkey, pre- revolutionary Iran and Imperial Ethiopia, as well as the Kurdish community across the Middle East such as in Iraq and Iran.https://ctc.usma.edu/the- factors-behind-rebellion-in-iranian-kurdistan/ Background The Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict was seen for many decades as primarily a conflict between Arab states and Israel, rather than a pan-Islamic one. Thus, nations such as Turkey and Iran, which were considered rivals of Arab states for regional dominance, were steadily cultivated by the Israeli government, which sought broader acceptance of its legitimate existence and security from nations in the region as well as seeking a window for future communication, negotiations and normalization of ties with Arab states. The goals of the Israeli government coincided with the policies of the Turkish and Iranian governments of the time. Turkey sought integration with the free-market economies and democracies of Europe, and is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and a candidate for membership in the European Union. The Shah of Iran was a major ally of the United States, which facilitated the dialogue between Israel, Iran and Turkey. The principle was also applied towards the Kurdish people, who constitute significant minorities in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Israeli government officials provided extensive support to Kurdish political parties and their aspirations for greater self-government and even independence. The government of Iraqi Kurdistan has maintained open ties with Israel and is an influential lobby for the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between Israel and Iraq. Development In 1950, both Turkey and Iran became the first and for a long time, the only Muslim states to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. Both Turkey and Iran developed close relations with Israel that involved extensive military cooperation. Israel aided the industrial and military development in Turkey and Iran. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Iran supplied Israel with essential oil and petroleum. Israel also made significant progress in achieving normal relations with Ethiopia, Nigeria and India, all nations with significant Muslim populations. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Israel managed to establish relations with the newly independent Muslim republics of Central Asia such as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and others. However, Israeli overtures to Indonesia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Malaysia were rebuffed. Unravelling The overthrow of the Shah of Iran in 1979 was a major setback for the policy. The Islamic regime of Iran severed relations with Israel, and its leaders such as Ruhollah Khomeini, Ali Khamenei and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have repeatedly called it an \\"illegal entity\\" and even advocate its destruction. Even so, according to author Trita Parsi, the doctrine led to questionable attempts by Israel to establish good relations with the avowedly anti-zionist Islamic Republic of Iran after the Islamic Revolution. Parsi quotes professor David Menashri of Tel Aviv University, \\"Israel's foremost expert on Iran,\\" as saying, \\"Throughout the 1980s, no one in Israel said anything about an Iranian threat‚Äîthe word wasn't even uttered.\\"Parsi, Trita Treacherous Alliance (2007), p. 104. The rise of the Islamist Justice Development Party of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the 2000s has led to a steady deterioration in Israel‚ÄìTurkey relations. Unlike previous Turkish governments, Erdogan's government has openly condemned Israel's policies towards Palestine and blamed it for the conflict.

Weber was active in the early years of the fur trade, exploring territory in the Rocky Mountains and areas in the current state of Utah. The Weber River, Weber State University, and Weber County, Utah were named for Weber. Early life John Henry Weber was born in the town of Altona, then part of Denmark and now a borough of Hamburg in Germany. Weber immigrated to the United States where he was hired by the U.S. Army Ordnance Department to keep records for the government-owned lead mines in Sainte Genevieve, Missouri. Into the Fur Trade Weber became acquainted with William Henry Ashley and Andrew Henry who conducted the beaver trade in the drainage of the Upper Missouri River. He joined a Rocky Mountain Fur Company expedition which departed St. Louis, Missouri in the spring of 1822. Other trappers in this group included: Jim Bridger, David Jackson, Jedediah Smith, Thomas Fitzpatrick, Hugh Glass, James Clyman, Daniel T. Potts, and Milton Sublette. This was the first party of American trappers to cross the continental divide. Upon reaching the mouth of the Yellowstone River, the company divided into two independent brigades, with Weber serving in a leadership position. During the summer of 1824, Weber's brigade crossed South Pass and the Green River Valley and descended into the Bear River region in time for a fall hunt. As winter approached, the company journeyed to Bear Lake, then to the Bear River's northern bend and finally south into what is today Utah's Cache Valley. The brigade spent the winter of 1824-25 on Cub Creek near present-day Cove, Utah. While in Cache Valley, the group discussed the possible course and ultimate outlet of the Bear River. According to his own account, the young Bridger was selected to settle the question by floating down the river. For many years Bridger was credited for the discovery of the Great Salt Lake. More recent evidence suggests, that Canadian-American Etienne Provost and his trapping party, working out of Taos in Mexican territory, visited the southern edge of the inland sea earlier in the same winter. The following spring, Weber's brigade traveled throughout extreme southeastern Idaho and northern Utah. A portion of the brigade, under the leadership of Johnson Gardner, confronted Peter Skene Ogden, the leader of Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) Snake Country Expedition near present-day Mountain Green, Utah. Gardner insisted that they were in United States territory. Ogden countered that the area in contention was under joint occupation. During the incident, Gardner was able to lure a number of men, many of them Canadian Iroquois, away from their British employer by offering higher prices for their furs. The reduction in force led Ogden to retrace his steps back to the HBC \\"Flathead House\\" near Flathead Lake in modern Montana. That summer, Weber and his brigade were at the first rendezvous held in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, near present McKinnon, just north of the Utah border. Weber's remaining mountain years are less well documented; however, he spent the winter of 1825-26 in the Salt Lake Valley after Ashley's men were forced by severe winter weather to move their winter quarters from Cache Valley. It appears that Utah's Weber River was christened, during this winter camp. This Weber place-naming gave rise to the present names of Utah's Weber Canyon, Weber County and Weber State University. Weber attended the rendezvous of 1826, in Cache Valley and left the fur trade, and the West, shortly thereafter. However, some accounts confuse John Henry Weber with a trapper named John Weber, who was killed by Indians in the winter of 1828-29. Later years and death Weber spent the remainder of his life in the American Midwest, first returning to Ste. Genevieve, Missouri and his former position, as recorder with the U.S. government, lead mines. In 1833, Weber was the assistant superintendent of U.S. government lead mines in Galena, Illinois, and served briefly, as superintendent, until his retirement in 1840. Weber moved to Bellevue, Jackson County, Iowa, where he died by suicide in February, 1859. Pronunciation The proper pronunciation of Weber's surname, Weeber or Webber, has been debated. In the American East and Midwest, where Weber spent most of his life, the name is pronounced as Webber. This is substantiated by Warren Angus Ferris' map of the fur trade era in which he gives the name of the Weber River as \\"Webber's Fork.\\" However, references by other fur trappers, such as Osborne Russell and Daniel Potts, give credence to the long vowel sound. The long vowel pronunciation is used in all Utah place names. Weber's own family descendants use the traditional Midwest pronunciation of Webber. Weber was born in Altona, Hamburg, Germany and if you look at the pronunciation of the word in German it would sound more like \\"Vee-bar\\". https://www.thoughtco.com/pronunciation-and-alphabet-4076770 There is no other word in the English language pronounced \\"weeber\\". https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op;=translate&sl;=de&tl;=en&text;=weber Therefore, if you are speaking German it would be \\"Veebar\\", if you are speaking English it would be \\"Webber.\\" It is safe to assume that the mispronunciation originated from hearing Weber say his name with a German accent, and combining the spelling (with a W) and the pronunciation (with a VEE) to create \\"Weeber.\\" ReferencesSources * * Hafen, LeRoy R., ed.

Early life and career Passot was born in 1955 in Villefranche-sur-Sa√¥ne, in France's Rh√¥ne-Alpes. He is a classically trained French chef, having attended cooking school in Lyon while beginning as an assistant, at age fourteen, in the city's L√©on de Lyon restaurant under Chef Paul Lacombe, and then Pierre Orsi Restaurant. After Passot rose to the rank of assistant sous-chef at L√©on de Lyon, Jean Banchet (who Passot considers his most important influence) recruited him in 1979 to work at Le Francais in Wheeling, Illinois (near Chicago, Illinois  Chicago), then sent him in 1981 to open the French Room at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, Texas (He was fired from the French Room after getting into a shouting match with its maitre d'). In between, he opened Le Castel in San Francisco.  Restaurants  Passot opened La Folie on Polk Street in 1988, with his wife Jamie and brother Georges. A small brasserie in the Polk Gulch section of the Russian Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, it opened at a cost of $45,000 with no outside investors. His wife conceived the name, which means \\"craziness\\" or \\"folly\\" in French, referring to the difficulty of opening a new establishment in San Francisco's competitive restaurant scene. Still a family business, his brother serves as sommelier, and his wife as general manager. Instantly successful, La Folie steadily gained in reputation and refinement until by 2000 it was one of only several restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, to earn a \\"four star\\" review from the San Francisco Chronicle, from the city's most recognized food critic. It still had that distinction as of 2008. Avoiding \\"fusion\\" influences, the establishment is a conventional contemporary French restaurant, with classic French use of stocks and sauces but lighter than traditional French and with attention to local ingredients. Passot, Levine join forces to open Left Bank in 1994, with partner Ed Levine, a Stanford Business School graduate who had been CFO of the Il Fornaio chain, Passot opened the much larger (220 seat) Left Bank restaurant in Larkspur, California, as a more casual alternative to La Folie. The second Left Bank opened in Menlo Park, California in 1998, and then San Jose in 2003. Left Banks are warm, vibrant brasseries offering quality French- inspired cuisine. The restaurants serve a style of home-style cooking Passot calls \\"Cuisine Grand-mere\\". In 2009 the Left Bank restaurant group opened LB Steak, a modern American Steakhouse, in San Jose's premier Santana Row. LB Steak is a casually elegant American Steakhouse reflecting the distinctive charm of Santana Row's surroundings and neighbors. Featuring USDA Prime Beef, they are known for a diverse selection of 10 prime steaks and Sunday night Prime Rib dinners. Influence and awards In style, Passot favors contemporary French cuisine, avoiding fusion, molecular gastronomy, and new devices or techniques such as sous vide. Passot has a reputation for hiring and mentoring young academy-trained chefs. A number of successful restaurant chefs credit Passot as a mentor, or as inspiration, including Richard Reddington, the Michelin starred Chef of REDD in Yountville, CA. Jeffrey Russell, Executive Chef at The Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City, Trey Foshee of George‚Äôs at the Cove in La Jolla, California, and Michael Kramer, formerly of McCrady‚Äôs Restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina and (as of 2008) of Voice Restaurant in Houston, Texas In 1991 Passot was inducted into the Maitres Cuisiniers de France. His restaurant won the Zagat Survey awards for \\"Best Food\\" and \\"Best Nouvelle French restaurant\\" in 1998, and \\"Best French restaurant\\" in San Francisco, in 2002. He also earned a James Beard Award as \\"best rising star chef\\" of 1980, and other \\"best\\" designations and awards from USA Today, Food & Wine Magazine, Gourmet magazine, Gault Millau, and SF Weekly. In 2001 the French Government awarded him the \\"Chevalier dans l‚ÄôOrdre du M√®rite Agricole\\". A local caviar producer, Tsar Nicoulai, has named a product after him. Personal life Passot met his wife, Jamie, when she was working at the Four Seasons Resort in Irving, Texas. They have two kids, Charlotte and Jean Paul. Known for being gregarious and social, Passot is a frequent participant in cooking shows and demonstrations, charity events, and television appearances. After gaining weight from the stress of managing his restaurants, he lost 60 pounds by eliminating alcohol, sugar, and starches from his diet.

He was capped by Worcestershire in 1938, and by Lancashire in 1946. King made a quiet first-class debut for Worcestershire against Northamptonshire in August 1935, scoring just 3 in his only innings. He appeared twice more that season, though did nothing of note, and although he played 20 games in 1936 and 1937 he made only two half-centuries: 51 not out against Surrey in July 1936 and 50* versus Essex the following month. 1938 was a considerably more successful summer for King. He passed a thousand runs for the first time, hitting 1,178 at an average of 22.65, and scoring his maiden century, 104 against Kent at Tonbridge in June. He also made 124 against Hampshire at Worcester later in the season. On this occasion, he reached his hundred before lunch. Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1971. Although King just failed to repeat the thousand in 1939, hitting 974 runs, he scored another two hundreds that summer. In early July he took over the gloves from George Abell during the match against Surrey, and effected five dismissals. King was named as wicket-keeper in four other matches that year. When first-class cricket resumed after the war, King offered to return to Worcestershire on condition he was paid one pound for every run over a thousand he scored, but the county refused to accept. Instead, he moved to Lancashire, for whom he had a successful 1946. He scored 1,145 runs at almost 31, and again struck two centuries. The higher of these was the career-best 145 he made versus Gloucestershire in May; he scored a hundred runs before lunch on the third day, having begun the morning on 34*. King's final season of 1947 was not particularly successful: he made only 360 runs in 17 innings and passed 50 just twice. After that he retired from playing and took a position as a cricket and rugby league columnist with the People newspaper. In this role he twice accompanied the Great Britain team to Australia, and he was preparing for a third such tour when his life was claimed by a heart attack at the early age of 54.

History Opened by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway, then absorbed by the North Eastern Railway the station joined the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. This company closed the station to passengers in 1930, although the goods service then passed on to the Eastern Region of British Railways upon nationalisation in 1948. Special and excursion passenger trains used the station until 27 July 1964, the last ramblers excursion to Kirbymoorside running on 3 May 1964, and the last passenger train was a Sunday school excursion. Most of the line closed to freight on 10 August 1964, but Amotherby station remained open until 17 October 1964 to honour a long-term contract with a local mill.

Some of those reasons, according to Fredriksen, was because Funeral's previous label, Arctic Serenades, decided to rip the band off, Toril Snyen was removed from the band (and replacing her proved difficult), finding a label, and lack of musical motivation from some band members. Eventually, the band got to recording this album, and according to Einar, it still had the trademarks of old Funeral, but was more inspired by their anger due to the certain aforementioned circumstances.

The school's enrollment (grades 9-12) never exceeded 400 and it never graduated a class of more than 85 students in its 68-year existence. The official name of the school was Madison High and Elementary School. History The transition from private to public school was rather gradual in Richmond. Between 1789 and 1910, several prominent academies flourished, but the public school system generally began on May 20, 1890, in an act of the general assembly of Kentucky. In that year the Richmond City School acquired the Madison Academy property, on which a new eight room building was dedicated in 1894. Several years later, two more rooms were added; and this building, known as Caldwell High School, was used for school purposes until 1921, when it was destroyed by fire. On July 5, 1919, the Richmond city Board of Education leased the property of the Madison Female Institute for ninety-nine years. The Female Institute had been a famous southern finishing school for girls. Following the Civil War era Battle of Richmond, the building was used for hospital wards, where both Union and Confederate soldiers were cared for by teachers and students. Caldwell was destroyed by fire on Wednesday, March 9, 1921. The Board of Education voted in favor of an $80,000 bond in order to erect a new building on the Madison Female Institute property. For the remainder of the school year and through the next two years (1921‚Äì23), the school was forced to use the county courthouse and churches to hold classes. In the fall of 1923, the Madison High School building was completed at a cost of $250,000. At that time, it had thirty-one classrooms, one music room, a science laboratory, three rooms for domestic science and manual training, a large cafeteria, a library, two office rooms, an auditorium capable of seating about 900. An 800-seat gymnasium was added in 1927. In 1950, new classrooms were added to provide more space, but by 1955 the entire building was so crowded that it was necessary to have double sessions in several grades. Later some of the churches were used for the first grade students until the new elementary schools (Bellevue and Mayfield) were completed in 1959. In 1962, a $135,000 renovation of the building was initiated. New dressing and shower rooms were added to the gymnasium. A new cafeteria and superintendent office were completed in 1963. For twenty-five years (1936-1961), the school formed a unique relationship with then Eastern Kentucky State Teachers College and its laboratory school, Model. This was accomplished through the efforts of then EKSC president Herman L. Donovan and Richmond City Schools superintendent William F. O'Donnell. O'Donnell had been superintendent of Richmond City Schools since 1925 and later became President of Eastern in 1940. The schools were accredited jointly by the Southern Association of Secondary Schools as Madison-Model High School. The two divisions retained their respective organizations, but combined such activities as commencement, athletics, and music until the schools were separated after the 1960-61 school year. Through the 1955-1956 school year, Madison High was a segregated school. Richmond's African-American students attended Richmond High School (located on East Main Street). In the fall of 1956, Richmond High was integrated into Madison as the Richmond City Board of Education carried out the Supreme Court's Brown decision. A gradual integration program was initiated that year as sophomores, juniors and seniors from Richmond High were enrolled at Madison. By 1960, freshmen were admitted as well. Richmond Junior High and Elementary remained open through the 1972-73 school year. Beginning with the 1973-74 school year through its closing after the 1988-89 school year, the fifth through twelfth grades attended Madison. Bellevue Elementary was used exclusively for first and second graders while Mayfield Elementary housed the third and fourth grades. The Richmond City Board of Education received national recognition for this innovative move that integrated the entire district. As Richmond grew and many citizens began to move to suburban locations on the outskirts of the Richmond city school district lines, a steady decline in enrollment gradually took place. By the 1980s, the school graduated (on the average) about 35 students a year. A combination of losing students to the Laboratory School, inability to expand the city school district (which resulted in a dwindling tax base) and the demographic trend known as white flight led to the decision to consolidate with the county system in 1989. The school nickname (adopted in 1925) was the 'Royal Purples'. Its physical plant is now the site of Madison Middle School, which opened in the fall of 1992 (after extensive renovation) and is one of five middle schools (grades 6‚Äì8) in the Madison County school system. Initially, the Madison County Board of Education voted to adopt green and white as the new school colors, but (after protests from several Madison High alumni) changed the decision and opted to keep the old school colors (purple and white). They did, however, decide to change the school's nickname to Panthers. Notable alumni *Garvice Kincaid, banker, attorney, financier, insurance company executive *Goebel Ritter, professional basketball player *Keith Bosley, professional football player Athletics Madison-Model fielded several excellent football teams in its last five years before their partnership was dissolved. New Eastern president Robert R. Martin took over from O'Donnell in the fall of 1960 and ended the partnership at the close of the school year. Roy Kidd had become the football coach in 1956 and the Purples recorded a 41-10-1 record over the next five years (1956‚Äì60). In their first year after separating from Model, Kidd's Royal Purples went 13-1 in 1961 and finished as the Class AA state-runner up to Fort Thomas Highlands. Three years later, coach Bobby Harville took Madison to the Class AA title game and again the Purples lost to Highlands (10-4 record). In the 1970s, coach Monty Joe Lovell led the Royal Purples to the Class A state playoffs four times. The Purples lost in the state semi-finals in 1972 (12-1), 1978 (9-4) and finished as state-runner up to Bellevue in 1979 (10-3). In its early football history, Madison finished as champions of central Kentucky in 1925. In 1924 and 1925, the Purples had a combined 15-4 record and defeated highly regarded Highlands in Thanksgiving Day matchups both seasons. Coach Velmar Miller led Madison to its last playoff appearance in 1985. Madison participated in Kentucky's well- known State Basketball Tournament six times. This was quite an accomplishment when consideration of their placement in the KHSAA's 11th Region is taken into account. The 11th Region then included schools in Lexington (and continues to do so today), and along with the 6th and 7th Regions that include Louisville schools, is one of the most competitive in the state. Madison's initial trip to the tournament was in 1939 when coach Ralph Carlisle took the Purples to the state quarter-final round. Consecutive trips followed (then as Madison- Model) in 1944 and 1945 under coach Bob Ackerman. Ackerman led the Royal Purples to the 1947 11th Region title as well. Coach Ray Vencill led Madison to consecutive 11th Region championships in 1969 and 1970. In 1970, the underdog Purples nearly pulled off an upset in the state title game as they fell to powerful Male High School of Louisville 70-69 and finished as Kentucky's state runner-up. Forward Robert Brooks was named Kentucky's Mr. Basketball. Madison-Model also participated in the state baseball tournament multiple times and finished as Kentucky state-runner-up in 1945 and 1946 (losing in the finals to parochial schools Louisville St. Xavier '45 and Newport Catholic '46). The girls' track team was crowned the Class A Kentucky state champion in 1978.

In order to achieve its goals, TIRN uses a combination of grassroots education and organizing, legal pressure, hands-on conservation, innovative use of the media, research and policy advocacy. TIRN has offices in the United States, Costa Rica and Papua New Guinea and is currently supported by over 10,000 members. TIRN states its vision as: > Foreseeing a time when a critical-mass of people in communities all over the > world share a common understanding of the intrinsic value of biodiversity > and a permanent commitment to acting as wise, willing and able stewards of > life in the earth's oceans and on its lands.  History  TIRN was founded in 1999 to provide an umbrella organization for the Sea Turtle Restoration Project. This had at the time been an affiliate organization of the Earth Island Institute since 1989, focusing on the international protection of endangered sea turtles. In 1999, the project broke off from its parent group and re-incorporated as the Turtle Island Restoration Network. Since its founding in 1999, TIRN has diversified and expanded its programs. The project, based in Olema, Marin County, California, now includes offices in the Gulf of Mexico, Central America and the Western Pacific. In addition, Got Mercury?, a program to educate the public about mercury levels in seafood, was developed in 2002 under TIRN and the Sea Turtle Restoration Project. In 1999, the Salmon Protection and Watershed Network, a volunteer- driven program focused on protecting endangered salmon in the Lagunitas Creek watershed, became an official program of TIRN. Turtle Island Restoration Network was a top finalist for Best Non-Profit Organization in Galveston.com's 2019 Best of the Island Awards.  Programs  TIRN is the umbrella organization for two major programs: Sea Turtle Restoration Project The Sea Turtle Restoration Project was founded in 1989 with the mission to protect endangered sea turtles in ways that make cultural and economic sense to communities that share their habitats with the creatures. The project has a number of active projects including the Save the Leatherback program, the Gulf of Mexico program, US Pacific Sea Turtles, Central America program, Western Pacific program and Got Mercury? program. SPAWN (Salmon Protection and Watershed Network) SPAWN (Salmon Protection and Watershed Network) had its seeds in 1996 and in 1999 became an official program under the umbrella of TIRN.

Centre beat Harvard 6‚Äì0, in what is widely considered one of the greatest upsets in college football history. The prequel The teams first met in 1920, at Harvard Stadium in the Boston neighborhood of Allston, with Harvard coming off a Rose Bowl victory and an undefeated national championship season in 1919 (the school's fourth national championship in the prior ten years). Coming into the Centre game, Harvard was also undefeated and unscored upon in the 1920 season. Meanwhile, Centre College, a tiny school of 300 students in Kentucky, had little history of success in football before their current coach, Charley Moran, and star quarterback, Bo McMillin, arrived on campus in 1917. The Centre Praying Colonels shocked Harvard in the 1920 game simply by taking a 14‚Äì7 halftime lead. But, in the second half, Centre withered before the superior Harvard squad, and Harvard won the game 31‚Äì14. Following the game, Harvard's captain offered the game ball to Centre's quarterback Bo McMillin, but McMillin declined the ball and promised \\"We'll be back next year to take it home with us.\\" The game After a scoreless half and early in the third quarter, Red Roberts told McMillin \\"it's time to score, ride my hump\\" and McMillin ran for a 32-yard touchdown. He dodged three of Harvard's secondary. Aftermath Bob Fisher said after the game \\"In Bo McMillin Centre has a man who is probably the hardest in the country to stop.\\" McMillin scores. Immediate impact All around Danville students painted the \\"impossible formula\\" of C6H0. The Centre victory was a shock, but perhaps not a fluke; the team would finish the 1921 season 10‚Äì1, defeating several of the nation's powerhouses including VPI, Auburn, Arizona, and Clemson. Their only defeat was a 22‚Äì14 loss to powerful Texas A&M; in the 1922 Dixie Classic (forerunner of the Cotton Bowl), in Dallas, Texas, on January 2, 1922 (the game where A&M;'s famous \\"12th man\\" was born). Bo McMillin got married in Dallas the day before the game, and the Colonels were in the midst of a grueling long distance trip from home by train, having played Arizona in San Diego, California, the week before. Up until their final game of the season the Colonels outscored their opponents by a margin of 314 to 6. \\"Greatest Upset\\" In 1950, the Associated Press named C6H0 the greatest sports upset of the first half of the 20th century. In 2005, The New York Times called it \\"arguably the upset of the century in college football.\\" In 2006, ESPN named it the third-biggest upset in the 138-year history of college football. On the 75th anniversary of C6H0, Centre challenged Harvard to a rematch. Harvard declined.

She is a two-time winner of the Best Leading Actress award at the Golden Horse Awards and winner of the Best Actress prize at the Asia-Pacific Film Festival, as well as an artist of Chinese glass or liuli. \\"Beauty transformed\\" is how Japanese critics have described the multiple talents of Loretta Hui-Shan Yang. Loretta Yang was named Best Leading Actress in the 21st and 22nd Golden Horse Film Awards ceremony. She was the first actress who won this award two years in a row. Having committed herself to Chinese glass for more than a decade, she has single-handedly rediscovered the technique of cire-perdue glass casting. She has used this technique to create works with a traditional Chinese artistic flare.Liuligongfang Official Introductory Booklet (excerpt included in the product packaging). She graduated from Taiwan Women Providence University.  Personal Life  Loretta Yang starred opposite Chang Yi in several movies. It was exposed that Chang Yi was having an extramarital affair by his then wife Hsiao Sa. She wrote an open letter to the media after which Chang Yi split. Yang and Chang both left the film industry and restarted life in glass art. Film= Jade Love or Yuqing Sao (1984)  In Jade Love, Loretta Yang played the main protagonist. The movie is based on a novella with the same name written by Kenneth Pai Hsien-yung. The story revolves around a female domestic worker who falls in love with a younger man. The film was well-known for the love-making scenes between Loretta Yang and Chang Yi, who continue to work together after this initial appearance.  Kuei-Wei, a Woman or Wo Zheyang Guo Le Yisheng (1985)  The next film they worked on together was a widespread success. The film won Loretta Yang Best Actress at the 1985 Golden Horse Awards and also took Best Film, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. The adapted screenplay was written by Chang Yi and his then wife, Hsiao Sa. The film depicts the transition of Taiwanese women as the society moved from an agricultural based society in the 1950s to an industrial society in the 1980s. Contemporary Glass Artist \\"May the moment come when I attain enlightenment that my body, my soul, my spirit becomes like crystal. Pure. Transparent. Flawless.\\"Brewerton, Andrew. \\"Glass Sultura (cast and kiln -formed glass): Loretta Yang Hui-Shan\\". Crafts Arts International, 78 (2010): 21, In 1987 Yang left the film industry to create art. She, along with her husband, film director Chang Yi, and several other people from the film industry established the glass workshop and studio Liuli Gongfang near Taipei, Taiwan. The industrious group invested their resources in rehabilitating a dilapidated factory and learned the techniques and process of glass casting, p√¢te de verre in the French manner, similar to the luxury glass made by Lalique and Daum. Today, Liuli Gongfang owns factories on Taiwan (Tamshui) and in Shanghai, a museum/nightclub in Shanghai, and numerous galleries on Taiwan and in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The group decided to use the Chinese word liuli as opposed to more common names for glass in the Chinese language. It is commonly believed that the word liuli first appeared during the Western Zhou Dynasty (about 1045-771 BCE), which referred to the glass being produced at the time. For Yang especially, using the term liuli, greatly references her own body of work which draws upon traditional Chinese motifs and such Buddhist teachings as enlightenment and transparency, evoking an almost meditative practice and devotional purpose.Brewerton, Andrew. \\"Glass Sultura (cast and kiln -formed glass): Loretta Yang Hui-Shan\\".

An additional degree of freedom, called 'the demon', is added to the system and is able to store and provide energy. If a drawn microscopic state has lower energy than the original state, the excess energy is transferred to the demon. For a sampled state that has higher energy than desired, the demon provides the missing energy if it is available. The demon can not have negative energy and it does not interact with the particles beyond exchanging energy. Note that the additional degree of freedom of the demon does not alter a system with many particles significantly on a macroscopic level.  Motivation  In thermodynamical systems, equal macroscopic properties (e. g. temperature) can result from different microscopic properties (e. g. velocities of individual particles). Computer simulations of the full equations of motion for every individual particle to simulate microscopic properties is computationally very expensive. Monte Carlo methods can overcome this problem by sampling microscopic states according to stochastic rules instead of modeling the complete microphysics. The microcanonical ensemble is a collection of microscopic states which have fixed energy, volume and number of particles. In an enclosed system with a certain number of particles, energy is the only macroscopic variable affected by the microphysics. The Monte Carlo simulation of a microcanonical ensemble thus requires sampling different microscopic states with the same energy. When the number of possible microscopic states of thermodynamical systems is very large, it is inefficient to randomly draw a state from all possible states and accept it for the simulation if it has the right energy, since many drawn states would be rejected.  The demon algorithm  The full procedure can be summarized by the following steps: # Perform a random change in the state of a randomly chosen particle (e. g. change velocity or position). # Calculate the change in energy \\\\Delta E of the thermal system. # Negative \\\\Delta E, i. e. excess energy, is given to the demon by adding \\\\Delta E to the demon. This case (\\\\Delta E < 0) is always accepted. # The demon provides positive \\\\Delta E to keep the total energy constant only if it has sufficient energy, i. e. E_d > \\\\Delta E. In this case the change is accepted, otherwise the randomly chosen change in velocity is rejected and the algorithm is restarted from the original microscopic state. # If the change is accepted, repeat the algorithm for the new configuration. Since energy fluctuations per degree of freedom are only of order 1/N, the presence of the demon has little effect on macroscopic properties of systems with high numbers of particles. After many iterations of the algorithm, the interplay of demon and random energy changes equilibrates the system. Assuming that a particular system approaches all possible states over very long times (quasi-ergodicity), the resulting Monte Carlo dynamics realistically sample microscopic states that correspond to the given energy value. This is only true if macroscopic quantities are stable over many Monte Carlo steps, i. e. if the system is at equilibrium.

The game was released as a download on May 1, 2007 and was followed by CD-ROM release on September 27, 2007. Players assume the role of a young Chocolatier, who must navigate 14 cities around the globe while buying ingredients, manufacturing chocolates, and selling them to chocolate shops. Two modes of play are available: in story mode the player must rebuild an almost bankrupt chocolate empire and acquire 64 chocolate recipes from around the world; in free mode players start out with scant resources and must become successful chocolatiers. Chocolatier was the first game developed by Big Splash Games, a trio of video game designers, who remained employees whilst developing a prototype game in their spare time. This prototype was rejected by publishers, but after coming up with the premise of Chocolatier the team was signed-up by PlayFirst and completed the title. The game received a mostly positive reception: reviewers enjoyed the action mini-game which is played when chocolates are manufactured, and the game's graphics, sound, and Victorian-era presentation.  Gameplay  The player assumes the role of a young chocolatier in 1880, during the Victorian era. The game has two modes of play: story and free play. Story mode involves a number of quests, including delivering specific chocolates and restoring the fictional Baumeister chocolate empire to its former glory. The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world. The player must locate the 64 lost recipes, visit 14 different cities around the globe, purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories, establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers, and manufacture chocolates to keep in business. Free play mode allows the player to travel, manufacture, and trade without undertaking quests. This mode starts the player with a small amount of cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use. In story mode, players begin with a single factory and a recipe for simple chocolate bars, the player must visit the market to purchase ingredients and begin the manufacturing process. The chocolate manufacturing process is an action minigame and a departure from the main game's economic simulation gameplay. The cities have a chocolate shop, where the player can sell his or her stock, and a market where ingredients can be purchased. Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn, as long as the required ingredients are in stock. During story mode, quests are given by non-player characters; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non-player character, who is either traveling or can be found at a set location. Quest rewards take the form of a high price for the chocolates or a new recipe. Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll. Market owners can be bartered with, though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them. When producing a particular chocolate for the first time, a minigame is played where ingredients are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon. The ingredients and quantities needed vary, depending on the recipe. Each time a circle is filled with the correct ingredients, it is removed and an empty circle put in its place. The trays spin faster as more circles are filled. If too many ingredients are wasted by misfiring the cannon, production is brought to a halt and the mini-game must be attempted again. The mini-game ends when the timer runs out; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week. The mini-game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct ingredients, and it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory.  Development  Tucson, Arizona based Big Splash Games was formed in late 2005 by three veterans of the videogame industry: Jon Blossom, Stephen Lewis and Michael Wyman. They came together to produce a prototype video game for the casual market. They worked on this for a few months when they were not working (they still held jobs within the industry to support themselves). This prototype was pitched to a few publishers in order to gain feedback. PlayFirst, though not interested in the prototype, issued the team a request for proposal for an economic simulation game, hoping that Big Splash could produce another proposal. The next morning, Big Splash co- founder Stephen Lewis remembered that he had been told that some people, in particular women, \\"have an almost religious connection with chocolate\\". Taking this idea he quickly wrote a proposal and forwarded it to his two partners. After brainstorming the idea the team decided that it satisfied PlayFirst's request for proposal, forwarded a copy of the idea and received word from the publisher that they \\"had hit the nail on the head\\". Chocolatier was designed to appeal to women aged between 35 and 55, a different market compared to the games previously developed by the trio. In order to immerse themselves in the subject matter during development, Big Splash's staff tasted as many variety of chocolates as they could find and took the Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker factory tour, where they witnessed the full \\"bean to bar\\" process. The factory mini-game was developed in order to give players a break from the economic side of the game, which involves buying low and selling high. It took approximately the same time to produce the mini-game as it did to create the rest of the game, which drained the developer's resources, though Stephen Lewis believed this was \\"the right decision\\". Journalists were sent Chocolatier-branded chocolate bars and \\"golden tickets\\" which allowed them to download the game for free, in order to promote the game's release. The game's sequel, Chocolatier 2: Secret Ingredients was first released on November 27, 2007. Chocolatier: Decadence by Design is the third installment, released in 2009. The Great Chocolate Chase: A Chocolatier Twist was later released by PlayFirst.  Reception  Chocolatier was awarded Gamezebo's Zeeby award for best strategy game of 2007. GameZone's Anise Hollingshead found the game too easy, noting \\"there really isn‚Äôt a whole lot of thinking involved.\\" Other reviewers called it \\"a delightfully challenging business tycoon game\\", and \\"challenging but not frustratingly so.\\" The game's graphics and sound received praise: Marc Saltzman noted \\"the game's wonderful art style and delightful music\\". Reviewers praised the amount of freedom given to players. Didi Cardoso of website Grrl Gamer enjoyed the flexibility, but noted that sometimes she felt lost and was unsure of how to find the location of the next recipe. The chocolate manufacturing mini-game was also praised as \\"fun\\". Peter Cohen of Macworld noted that some fans of business simulators might find the mini-game \\"off-putting\\", but also suggested that it helped break up gameplay. Marc Saltzman expressed the same opinion, while Anise Hollingshead found the mini- game to be too easy to play.

They are descended from the independent pre-Columbian tribal confederation of the same name. The historic people are particularly noted for their resistance against the Inca Empire. Eventually conquered by the Inca in the early 16th century shortly before the arrival of the Spanish, the Ca√±ari later allied with the Spanish against the Inca. Today, the population of the Ca√±ari, who include many mestizos, numbers in the thousands. The earlier people defended their territory for many years against numerous Incan armies. T√∫pac Yupanqui conquered the Huancabambas, the most southern of the Ca√±ari allies. Through wars and marriages, the Inca Empire under the lead of Huayna Capac to the north finally conquered their territory. The Ca√±ari were loosely assimilated into the vast empire, allowed to manage their own affairs but adopting a new language for communicating with the Inca. The tribe primarily occupied the Tumebamba area (present day Cuenca). Due in part to Incan influence and mandate, Ca√±ari construction reportedly rivaled that of the Incan capital, Cuzco. Of particular repute was the impressive architecture of Tumebamba, which has often been referred to as the \\"second Cuzco.\\" During the Inca Civil War between the sons of Huayna Capac, the Ca√±ari chose to support Hu√°scar, despite being positioned in the northern area inherited by the son and heir Atahualpa. Initially, Hu√°scar's generals Atoc and Hango were successful, defeating Atahualpa's army, capturing many of his soldiers, and seizing the large cities Cajamarca and Tumebamba. Aided by his father's loyal generals, Atahualpa managed to rout the Hu√°scaran army in the battles of Mullihambato and Chimborazo. This forced the interlopers back to the south. He captured and executed Huascar's generals and executed the Ca√±ari supporters once he reached Tumebamba.  Origins  The word Ca√±ari comes from \\"kan\\" meaning \\"snake\\" and \\"ara\\" meaning \\"macaw\\". According to some linguists, it means the Ca√±ari believed their ancestors were the snake and the macaw. Another explanation is that they considered these animals sacred, as is demonstrated by stories and designs. Within the great Ca√±ari family, there were groups with their own cultures. One of these was the Peleusis, which was located in the area of the modern city of Azogues and had hegemony over neighbouring tribes. According to a traditional story, the location of the Pelusis was founded by the caciques Tenemaza and Carchipulla. These surnames still exist in the province. Myth Scholars have found that the Ca√±ari had an oral tradition of a massive flood as part of their creation stories, similar to those of the Bible and Gilgamesh. According to myth, it was said that a giant flood occurred in which everyone perished except two brothers who had perched on top of a high mountain. After the flood, both brothers returned to their hut. They found it had been repaired and stocked with prepared food. Every day when they returned to the hut, they found prepared food. This went on a few days until Urcocari (male hill), one of the brothers, decided to stay around. He learned that a woman with a macaw face had made the food. He took her as his wife, and they repopulated the world.  History  After the Incan conquest, the Incas settled in the Ca√±ari capital, which became an important regional center. At the back can be seen the Temple of the Sun of the Incan period.  Inca Conquest  The Inca brought numerous armies, battle hardened and well disciplined; and the Huancabambas escaped terrified to the mountains and hills where some died of hunger rather than submit to the invading Incan armies. The triumph over the Paltas was even more complete because they surrendered themselves and were incorporated into the Inca \\"empire\\". Notwithstanding such docility, T√∫pac Yupanqui took some thousands of them and sent them far from their territories to the remote provinces of Collao, and settled the land of the Paltas with mitimaes from other provinces. The fortresses, which had been prepared on the highlands of Saraguro, did not help them at all because the presence of Inca troops in the valley made them know that all resistance would be useless. Having vanquished and subjugated the Paltas, T√∫pac Yupanqui continued the conquest of the Ca√±ari. The Ca√±ari were numerous and had been for much time before silently preparing for the defense of their lands and their independence: they had celebrated a union of all the leaders and elected Dumma as chief and had, moreover, a considerable army. T√∫pac Yupanqui thought that he should not lose time or give the Ca√±ari space to fortify more: he thus rushed his troops and attacked the enemies, expecting to defeat them by surprise; but he was mistaken because the Ca√±ari were aware of the attack and had occupied all the difficult passes. The battle was, thus, intense and the Inca retreated hastily toward Saraguro, seeing that the defeat of tribes as astute as they were bellicose was not so easy as he had imagined. The defeat of the Inca inspired new bravery in the Ca√±ari and, combining valor with strategy, they communicated secretly with the Paltas, inciting them to rebel against the Inca: such a risky enterprise unnerved the Paltas and, after consulting with their wisemen what to do, they resolved to tell T√∫pac Yupanqui of the Ca√±ari plans. The proud T√∫pac Yupanqui was offended and resolved not to return to Cuzco without first subjugating the Ca√±ari. He sent for reinforcements from all of the Inca \\"empire\\"; and while they were arriving, he constructed a fortification along the border between the Paltas and the Ca√±ari. Knowing of these Inca preparations and seeing the works or preparations for war that had begun, morale began to weaken, and the strength with which the first assault was resisted was exchanged with discouragement. They began to look for a peaceful solution and, at last, sent messengers to the Inca, charged with offering to submit to his \\"empire\\". The Ca√±ari were famous for being fickle. As such, the Inca did not believe them at first, only after taking measures for his security and demanding, as one of those measures, that Dumma and other leaders send their own children as hostages, did he believe it. T√∫pac Yupanqui, thus assured, began to travel toward the province of Azuay; but before entering it personally, he sent his most trusted official to arrange for dignified accommodations and to determine the resolve of the Ca√±ari and discover any plans for treachery. The Ca√±ari received the envoy of the Inca with grand celebration, and in a very short time constructed a palace that would house their new lord; and when he appeared, finally, on their land, they came out to encounter him, giving public and solemn manifestations of sincere respect and of celebration. The Ca√±aris were loosely assimilated into the vast empire, allowed to manage their own affairs but adopting a new language. T√∫pac Yupanqui stayed a long time in the province of Azuay, taking away a considerable number of its native inhabitants and moving them to Cuzco; he constructed bridges on the rivers and ordered the construction of various buildings, as many religious as non-religious, wanting to earn the affection of the Ca√±ari and have them as subjects. T√∫pac Yupanqui beautified the city of Tumebamba where his son Huayna Capac was born. He gave the order to construct two fortresses: one in Achupallas, and another in Pumallacta. He built in the roughest location of the mountain chain a residence for the convenience of his army and subjugation, without any difficulty, of the Quillacos, who lived in the valley of Guasunos and Alaus√≠. So ended the conquest of the Ca√±ari and the incorporation of their territory in the Inca \\"empire\\".  Inca Civil War  During the civil war between Hu√°scar and Atahuallpa, the sons of Huayna C√°pac, the Ca√±ari chose to support Hu√°scar, despite being positioned in the northern area inherited by the son and heir Atahuallpa. Initially, Hu√°scar's generals Atoc and Hango were successful, defeating Atahuallpa's army and capturing many of his soldiers, including seizure of the large cities Cajamarca and Tumebamba. Aided by his father's loyal generals, Atahuallpa managed to rout the Hu√°scaran army in the battles of Mullihambato and Chimborazo. This forced the interlopers back to the south. He captured and executed Hu√°scar's generals and executed the Ca√±ari supporters once he reached Tumebamba. The Ca√±ari were punished heavily, leaving only 12 thousand of their original population of 50 thousand.  Spanish conquest  When Francisco Pizarro arrived at Tumbes, he received news that the Ca√±ari were against the government of Atahuallpa. The Ca√±ari hoped the Spanish people would liberate them from the Incas, and Pizarro included the Ca√±ari among his troops to face Atahuallpa and Inca resistance. In 1536, Ca√±ari and Spanish soldiers defeated the Inca in the battle of Sacsayhuam√°n. The Ca√±ari continued to be important under Spanish rule, often far from their ancestral home. After Pizarro was killed in 1541, a Ca√±ari leader named Francisco Chilche claimed to be the overlord (cacique) of much of the land of the Incan Quispiguanca estate in the Sacred Valley near Cuzco.. He fended off Indian rivals and the claims of Spaniards who sought land in the valley. As allies of the Spanish during the overthrow of the Inca Empire the Ca√±ari had legal standing with the Spanish.Niles, pp. 127-131 Chilche continued to be important into the 1570s when he recruited 500 Indian soldiers to fight with the Spanish in their war against the last Inca, Tupac Amaru.Thorton, John K. (2012), \\"A Cultural History of the Atlantic World, 1250-1820, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 174  Territory  The Ca√±ari were a group or confederacy of united tribes who formed a people; they inhabited the area from the limits of Azuay to Saraguro, from the Gualaquiza mountains to the Narajal beaches and the coasts of the Jambel√≠ canal. Within the Ca√±ari territory, the most important areas were Ca√±aribamba, Cojitambo, Chobshi, Shabalula, Molleturo, Coyoctor, Culebrillas, Yacubi√±ay, Guapondelig and Hatun Ca√±ar. After the Inca Conquest, the newcomers renamed the last two settlements as Tumebamba and Ingapirca, respectively. Located in the present- day provinces of Azuay, Ca√±ar, and El Oro in what is modern Ecuador, the ruins and archeological remains of Ca√±ari and Inca culture survive in many of those locations. T√∫pac Yupanqui renamed Guapondelig as Tumebamba. He had the palace of Pumapungo constructed, from which he governed the northern sector of the Inca empire. Years later, Huayna C√°pac returned to the north of the empire to put down the rebellion of the northern tribes, The largest known ruins of the Ca√±ari-Inca confederation are: * Ingapirca (Ca√±ar Province) * Pumapungo (Azuay Province) * Chobshi (Azuay Province) * Yacubi√±ay (El Oro Province) Of these four, Ingapirca is the best known. Pumapungo is not well known, although it is located in the centre of the city of Cuenca, behind the Museo del Banco Central. Chobshi and Yacubi√±ay have not been studied intensively or excavated by professional archeologists.  Culture  Young women wearing the typical hat The Ca√±ari people are believed to have had a federative monarchy. Each leader had hegemony over their individual tribe; however, in certain crises, such as natural disasters or wars, the confederacy of tribes would unite and choose a single leader. Some tribes had matriarchal societies or kinship systems. When the Inca married into these powerful families, they used marriage to gain de facto power over certain Ca√±ari bands. The Ca√±ari used a lunar calendar and built temples in circular or moon-like shapes. At Ingapirca, examples of round Ca√±ari buildings can be seen juxtaposed against the rectangular Inca buildings. The site also has stone \\"calendars\\". These devices are stones with holes drilled in them in various positions at various angles. The holes are filled with water to reflect celestial bodies. Each one reflects at different times, giving dates. As many as ten Ca√±ari dialects may have survived into the 21st century, but surviving speakers are few and far between. Researchers have been able to discover little information about the languages or how to speak them. Most indigenous people in Ecuador claim to speak Kichwa or Spanish. Language The Ca√±ari language is believed to be practically extinct. During the Inca conquest, the Ca√±ari learned Quechua (Kichwa). This language of the conquering people was enriched with many vernacular words absorbed by use of the conquered people. For instance, the names of certain objects or places such as rivers, mountains, etc., have been absorbed without a synonym sense in Quechua. During Spanish colonialism, missionaries worked to translate a catechism into Ca√±ari, in order to evangelize to this population. However, no copy of this manuscript survives. With the passage of time, the mission priests found evangelism in the language of each people to be very difficult. The Spanish rulers ordered the Ca√±aris to learn Kichwa, which contributed to the disuse of Ca√±ari. The lack of documentation has resulted in a death of knowledge about this language. Accent The Cuenca accent is theorized to be the relic of the original Ca√±ari language. Its distribution is in the footprint of the original Ca√±ari settlements, and is more prevalent in rural communities, where the distinctive pronunciation is stronger. The contrast of thinking that its origin come from the Quechua dialect is that the presence does not extend past the provinces of Ca√±ar and Azuay, while the Kichwa is present outside these. The accent of Cuenca also has its presence in northwestern Argentina, and theory suggest that it could have originated from mitimaes brought by the Incas in the wars of expansion. The accent 'cantadito' is also present in places of Bolivia.

After the turn of the century, businesses started to utilize filing systems with index cards and file folders. Thus began Charles S. Jonas and Brother first venture into manufacturing their own items. The product line was at first limited to index cards and guides, and gradually expanded, with sales covering a larger territory. The company was renamed Record Card Company in 1909, as a reflection of their new manufacturing endeavor. 1918‚Äì1939: new product development In 1918, the Record Card Company first registered Oxford as a brand name. The success of the Oxford brand led the company to change its name in 1921 to the Oxford Filing Supply Company. The firm continued to specialize in filing supplies, introducing many new items which contributed to the growth of the filing industry. In 1939, the company began making expanding envelopes and introduced the convenience of file folder labels in rolls, as well as corrugated board transfer files in a drawer style. The company's most significant advance, however, was the Oxford Pendaflex hanging file folder. This was the now familiar filing pouch that hooked over the sides of a file drawer. Smaller files placed inside the hanging file allowed the drawer to be easily subdivided. The company called its Pendaflex hanging file the greatest development in filing since the evolution of the filing folder. 1940‚Äì1968: U.S. expansion Oxford Filing Supply gradually expanded its operations beyond the New York City area, establishing a Midwestern base in the 1930s, with a factory in St. Louis. Its main plant moved in 1948 from Brooklyn to Garden City, New York. The company built a West Coast manufacturing facility in 1953 in Los Angeles, and the St. Louis and Los Angeles plants were expanded several times in the 1960s. Also during this time, the company opened new facilities in Augusta, Georgia, and in East Rutherford, New Jersey, while establishing an equipment division in Long Island, which later moved to larger quarters in Moonachie, New Jersey. 1969‚Äì1975: international expansion Oxford Filing Supply Company changed its name in 1969 to reflect its leading brand, and the company became the Oxford Pendaflex Corporation. 1972, Pendaflex introduced the color-coded system of filing.Pendaflex Business continued to grow, and, during the early 1970s, Oxford Pendaflex expanded its New Jersey, Missouri, Georgia, and California facilities. By 1976, the company had subsidiaries in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Venezuela, employed a work force of 1,200, and had a marketing organization supplying approximately 5,500 dealers and 60 wholesalers across the United States and Canada. 1976‚Äì1978: the takeover The company's comprehensive North American marketing organization was an attractive asset, and, in 1976, the Swedish office supply firm Esselte AB made a lucrative offer for Oxford Pendaflex. Oxford Pendaflex shares had been trading on the New York Stock Exchange for between $13 and $14 a share, and Esselte offered $23 a share to take over the American company. The two companies announced an agreement in March 1976, and Oxford Pendaflex became part of the Swedish company's Esselte Business Systems group. Esselte was a much larger firm than Oxford Pendaflex, with 1975 sales of approximately $350 million, compared to an estimated $60 million for the American firm. Esselte had positioned itself as one of the world's leading companies in office equipment, and it was willing to pay a high price for Oxford Pendaflex in order to gain access to the American and Canadian market. Sales grew in the years after the take over, reaching close to $75 million by 1978. That year Oxford Pendaflex, backed by parent company Esselte, took over the California company Dymo Industries, which was well known for its Dymotape labeling equipment. Dymo had revenues of close to $210 million, and more than half of its sales came from foreign operations. Esselte AB already distributed some of the Dymo line in Europe, and it paid out $43.5 million for the company. Although Dymo initially resisted the takeover, by July 1978 Oxford Pendaflex controlled 94 percent of Dymo's stock. Oxford took over the Dymo product lines, which included Ideal accounting books and the Sten-C-Labl addressing system in addition to Dymotape. 1979‚Äì1989: growth through acquisition The next year, Oxford Pendaflex changed its name to Esselte Pendaflex Corporation and continued to expand through acquisitions. In 1981, Esselte Pendaflex took over the operation of its parent's U.S. price marking division by integrating with the Esselte subsidiary Esselte Meto. Esselte Meto had been formed out of the price marking operations of Dymo and that of a 1980 acquisition, Primark. The company's next major addition was the Boorum & Pease Company in 1985. Boorum & Pease, based in Elizabeth, New Jersey, manufactured and marketed office supplies, record-keeping supplies, and information storage and retrieval products, and was a leading manufacturer of blank books and loose-leaf binders. The company had revenues of $70 million in 1985, and Esselte Pendaflex paid $40 million for it. That year, Esselte Pendaflex also acquired a Los Angeles firm called Universal Paper Goods. This company had a West Coast business manufacturing custom order folders and office supplies. Esselte Business Systems, of which Esselte Pendaflex was a division, continued to pursue growth through acquisition. The company bought up nine firms in 1987 alone, with total combined annualized sales of around $85 million. The three divisions of Esselte Business Systems, which included Esselte Pendaflex for office supplies, a division specializing in graphic arts supplies, and a retail supply division, posted record sales and profits in 1987. Esselte Pendaflex also named a new president that year, Theodore V. Kachel. 1990‚Äì1995: the decline In the early 1990s, however, the U.S. market for office supplies weakened significantly. Parent company Esselte AB was forced to institute a stringent cost-cutting plan that included large bouts of lay- offs in 1990 and 1991, in order to make up for the deteriorating market conditions in the United States, as well as in some European markets. Sales for Esselte Pendaflex dropped off steeply between 1989 and 1990, and revenue remained relatively static over the next few years. Operating income also shrank drastically between 1989 and 1990, and in 1993 the company posted a loss. The company's difficulties were attributed in part to changes in the North American office supply market overall. Distribution became more concentrated as stores consolidated through mergers and acquisitions and new superstores became more important players. Competition was intense between the large distributors, and prices overall were forced down. By 1993, Esselte Pendaflex had a smaller pool of customers than in past years, though the customers on the whole were larger. Another change in the market lay in the declining number of white collar workers within major corporations. And though more people were working from their homes, with an estimated 39 million home offices in 1992, this did not altogether offset the loss of corporate workers. Esselte Pendaflex was aware of these changing conditions and took steps to keep pace. However, the company's operating costs were very high in the early 1990s, and many of its products had low profit margins. This led to a disappointing drop in income. The company appointed a new divisional president in April 1993, Alan Wood. His mission was to reorganize the company for cost efficiency. Esselte Pendaflex expected to make major transitions through 1993 and 1994. 1995‚Äìpresent: new beginnings Despite recent changes in the market, the company still saw opportunity for growth and predicted improved profitability over the coming years. On July 11, 2002, the private equity investment firm, J.W. Childs, announced that it had decided to implement its public offer to the shareholders of Esselte/Pendaflex. The purchase price for Esselte was SEK 90 per share, equivalent to SEK 3,100 million (appr. $330 million). The change in ownership of Esselte provided a number of strong benefits to the company. The foremost among these was greater financial flexibility to pursue an aggressive, growth oriented strategy that included new product development and design in all product categories. The J.W. Childs acquisition also brought with it a lean management system philosophy that bases manufacturing runs and procurement on what it sells. Pendaflex expects to reduce work-in-process inventory by 50% or more, and ultimately turn over finished goods inventory every month. In 2014, RR Donnelley acquired all of the North American operations of Esselte.https://www.globenewswire.com/news- release/2014/01/06/600317/10062933/en/RR-Donnelley-to-Acquire-North-American- Operations-of-Esselte.html In 2016, RR Donnelley spun-off its office products business as LSC Communications.https://investor.rrd.com/spin-information LSC Communications currently offers its Oxford, Pendaflex and Ampad products through its subsidiary division TOPS Office Products.https://www.tops- products.com/ Technology and products Pendaflex makes general filing products and filing supplies, labeling systems and supplies, report covers and portfolios, bound books, binders and loose-leaf supplies, plastic office accessories, and document binding systems and supplies. Approximately 90 percent of the company's products are manufactured at the company's own production facilities in Missouri; Los Angeles, California, and other U.S. cities, as well as in Toronto, Canada. Pendaflex markets primarily in the United States and Canada, though its presence in the Mexican market is increasing. A small percentage of the company's sales include exports to the Caribbean, South and Central America, the Middle East, and Asia. Environmentally friendly filing In 1990, Pendaflex launched Earthwise recycled filing supplies, a complete line of environmentally friendly products.\\"Esselte Americas Media Kit\\" Products and technology associated with the Environmentally Friendly Filing line include: * File Folders * Hanging Folders * File Pockets * File Wallets Mobile Office File In 2000, Pendaflex introduced a new product called the Pendaflex Mobile File. The mobile file was developed for consumers who carry documents from one place to another - it is durable and water resistant. Hanging file folders In February 2004, Pendaflex released another new product line, an update to the original hanging file folder, called Pendaflex Ready-Tab Hanging Folders. This product added pre-installed tabs across the top of the hanging folders. Desktop organization In September 2006, Pendaflex launched its line of ‚ÄúPileSmart\\" products. After extensive research, Pendaflex discovered that half of office workers would rather pile documents than file them. This led to the development of filing system products that would allow workers to keep piling ‚Äì in an organized fashion. Products and technology associated with the PileSmart Desktop Organization line include: * Desktop Organizer Tray * Binder Label Clips * Label Clips * View Folders * View Folders with Tabs * Quickview Jackets * Project Sorters  Pendaflex Online Learning Center  On March 19, 2003, Pendaflex launched the Pendaflex Learning Center, an online education source that educates consumers on organizational techniques and systems. Pendaflex Learning Centers teaches users office essentials such as Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and offers in-depth courses on critical topics such as starting, marketing, managing and growing a business.  I Hate Filing Club  In 1986, Pendaflex launched the ‚ÄúI Hate Filing Club‚Äù for administrative professionals who dislike filing. An online version of the I Hate Filing Club was introduced in 1999. Members of the I Hate Filing Club communicate with their peers and share organizational ideas in the online community through a community message board, a monthly ‚ÄúKeeping Tabs‚Äù newsletter and by interacting with Club President, Sharon Mann in the ‚ÄúAsk Sharon‚Äù forum. The I Hate Filing Club has over 100,000 members. The Pendaflex Administrative Professional Hall of Fame In 2005, I Hate Filing Club members were invited to nominate employees, coworkers or friends for the prestigious ‚ÄúAdministrative Professional of the Year‚Äù title. Nominating essays were judged by the President of the International Association of Administrative Professionals (IAAP), the President of National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO) and a team of Pendaflex executives. The winner received a spa vacation for two in Arizona and a $4,000 stipend, along with a golden PENDY, a fresh bouquet of flowers every month for a year and Pendaflex organizational products, including the Project Sorter, Mobile File and Get-A- Grip Expanding File.  Environmental record  In the early 1990s, Pendaflex developed a line of products made from 100% recycled papers. This product line, called Earthwise, was the first line of filing supplies to meet or exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency's revised guidelines of 30% for post-consumer and recycled content, as they were made from fiber that contains 50% post-consumer materials.\\"Making the Green Choice That Makes the Difference\\" On April 30, 2008, Pendaflex announced that it achieved Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI Inc.) fiber sourcing certification across the United States. Fiber sourcing certification is granted when a company has verified that at least 66% of their supply comes from an SFI certified procurement operation. SFI's certification program is one of the largest in the world, with a standard based on principles and measures that promote responsible environmental behavior and sound forest management including measures to protect water quality, biodiversity, wildlife habitat, species at risk and forests of exceptional conservation value.

Her father, John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer, was a great- grandson of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Her sister was Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire. Being the youngest child, Harriet was often left in England when her parents and older sister Georgiana would visit the continent for her father's health. As a child, Harriet was frail and sickly, which led her mother to send her abroad for schooling, thinking that foreign air would help strengthen her. However, she grew into a young woman of exceptional beauty and intelligence, witty, well-read and self- assured.O'Toole, Fintan. A Traitor's Kiss: the Life of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Granta Books, 1997, p.250. On 27 November 1780, Harriet married Frederick Ponsonby, then the Viscount Duncannon, an Anglo-Irish nobleman who later became 3rd Earl of Bessborough. Their marriage was a difficult one; because Harriet and her husband were both gambling addicts, they often found themselves in debt. Frederick was also known to be abusive of Harriet, often humiliating her at public gatherings, as well as demanding that she find money to pay for the debts which he had incurred. In 1790, her husband began divorce proceedings, but, under intense pressure from both families, agreed to drop them. In addition to Lady Caroline, mentioned above, there were three sons to the marriage: John William, later 4th Earl of Bessborough; Frederick Ponsonby; and William Ponsonby, who became the 1st Baron de Mauley. Frederick and John by John Hoppner (1787) Harriet had numerous lovers during her marriage; as she once remarked, \\"I can never love anyone just a little\\". Among her more notable lovers were Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the playwright and Whig politician, and Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville, who became her most enduring lover. Her affair with Granville produced two illegitimate children: Harriet Emma Arundel Stewart, wife of George Godolphin Osborne, 8th Duke of Leeds (though she died in 1852 before he succeeded to the title), and George Stewart. Harriet managed to hide her pregnancies from her husband; this was less difficult in an era when the aristocracy might make extended visits of many months abroad or to friends' country homes. She later sadly remarked that for seventeen years she had \\"loved [Granville] to idolatry.\\" However, she came to believe that he loved her least of all the men in her life, \\"although I once believed otherwise\\".Cecil, David Sir. Mellbourne, Pan Books Edition, 1965, p.39. Recognizing his need to marry for purposes of his political career, she did not oppose, and in fact facilitated, Granville's marriage to her niece, Lady Harriet Cavendish ('Harryo') in 1809.Gleeson, Janet. Privilege & Scandal, 2006.Douglass, Paul. Lady Caroline Lamb, Palgrave-MacMillan, 2004. Of her younger admirers, her favourite was The Honourable William Lamb (who succeeded as The 2nd Viscount Melbourne in 1828), although he then fell in love with her daughter Caroline. Although Harriet was anxious for Caroline to marry early, she had misgivings (which would come to be entirely justified) as to whether William and Caroline were well suited; in addition she and William's mother Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne, detested each other (Henrietta referred to Lady Melbourne as \\"the Thorn\\"). However, due to her fondness for William, she gave her consent to their marriage.Cecil p.57 Richard Sheridan's feelings for her became an obsession. He distressed her greatly just before his death by saying that he hoped his ghost would haunt her; she asked him if he had not done enough through his life to make her unhappy, without wishing to harm her further?O'Toole p.466 Harriet often accompanied her sister to political events as well as soirees. She was also very close to her sister Georgiana's best friend, Lady Elizabeth Foster, with whom she often was seen in public. Harriet died on 11 November 1821, in Florence, Italy at the age of 60, following the death of her youngest grandchild, Henry, in Parma.Foreman, Amanda. Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, The Modern Library, 1998. According to Lord David Cecil, she died peacefully and without regrets, worn out as she was by a life of emotional turmoil.Cecil p.137 He describes her as a woman of \\"indescribable distinction\\".Cecil p.39 AncestryNotes and references External links  * * Bessborough Papers.

Washington, DC. ‚ÄúDeveloping Your Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan: A Guide for Construction Sites.‚Äù Document No. EPA-833-R-060-04. May 2007. A fiber roll is a temporary erosion control and sediment control device used on construction sites to protect water quality in nearby streams, rivers, lakes and seas from sediment erosion. It is made of straw, coconut fiber or similar material formed into a tubular roll. Installation Each horizontal contour level row of fiber rolls is installed on slopes, ending with one at the base of the slope, below an active construction area before soil disturbance (earth moving) begins. The space between each row of fiber roll is dependent on the steepness of the slope. The steeper the slope, the more rows of evenly spaced horizontal contour level fiber rolls are used. Each fiber roll is installed on a horizontal contour level in shallow trenches 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) deep and fastened to the ground with wooden stakes. Properly installed fiber rolls are effective at trapping sediment, generally more effectively than straw bales.California Stormwater Quality Association. Menlo Park, CA. \\"California Stormwater BMP Handbook: Fiber Rolls.\\" Fact Sheet No. SE-5. January 2003.U.S. EPA. \\"National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices: Fiber Rolls.\\" June 1, 2006. During rain storms, the rolls intercept surface stormwater runoff (but not concentrating or channeling the runoff) and reduce the velocity of flow. Water passes through a fiber roll while leaving behind the sediment on the uphill side of the roll, thereby reducing sediment erosion. Limitations Fiber Rolls have several limitations to their uses: *Fiber rolls may be difficult to move once they become saturated with water. *Fiber rolls should not be used on very steep land that is prone to mudslides, landslides or creep. *If fiber rolls are not properly staked into the ground, they may be carried away by high flows.

In 2015 it had a population of approximately 1,900. Trona is at the western edge of Searles Lake, a dry lake bed in Searles Valley, southwest of Death Valley. The town takes its name from the mineral trona, abundant in the lakebed. It is about northeast of Los Angeles, on State Route 178. The ZIP code is 93562. Trona is known for its isolation and desolation, as well as the nearby Trona Pinnacles. The local school plays on a dirt football field because the searing heat and highly saline soil kills grass. At one point it boasted an 18-hole golf course that was all sand except for the \\"greens\\", which were a softer grade of brown colored dirt. History Trona abuts the dry Searles Lake bed Starting in the late 1800s mining industry set up around Searles Dry Lake to mine borax. Trona was officially established in 1913, as a self-contained company town, wholly operated by its resident mining company to house employees. Employees were paid in company scrip instead of cash. The mining company also built a library, a scrip-accepting for-profit grocery store, a school, basic housing, and minimal recreation facilities. The Trona Railway was built in 1913‚Äì14 to provide the town with a rail connection to the Southern Pacific (now the Union Pacific) line at Searles. The railway still operates today. Economic booms and busts followed. Its most notable boom occurred during World War I, when Trona was the only reliable American source of potash, an important element used in the production of gunpowder. Today, Searles Valley Minerals Inc.'s soda ash processing plant remains the largest firm in town. Other operations nearby include evaporative salt extraction from the dry lake bed's surface, and a lime quarry. Searles Valley Minerals is the largest employer in Trona, and many employees live in Ridgecrest, California, commuting daily to Trona. Trona also serves as the headquarters and base of operations for the Trona Railway, a short-line railroad. Since its heyday, Trona's population has decreased. Based on 2010 U.S. Census Bureau data, Redlands-based geographic information systems firm Esri estimates Trona had 1,883 residents in 2010 and 1,904 residents in 2015, down from a peak of about 6,000 several decades prior. Esri predicts a small rise in population to 1,941 in 2020. Geography The same collection of geologic forces which created the Searles Valley where Trona sits also created the natural resource of Searles Dry Lake, which contains rich deposits of chemicals, including dozens of minerals. Located a few miles to the south are the Trona Pinnacles, an unusual landscape consisting of more than 500 tufa spires, some as high as 140 feet, rising from the bed of the Searles Lake basin. Trona is a seismically active area, and was heavily affected by the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes. Trona is located in the Eastern California Shear Zone, a seismically active zone that accommodates up to 25% of the fault movement between the Pacific and North American plates.

Education Trona High School's unique dirt football fieldK-12 public education is provided through the Trona Joint Unified School District. The California Department of Education indicates that 255 students were enrolled in the district's schools during the 2015-16 academic year, down from 576 students in 1996-97 (the earliest data available on their website). Trona Joint Unified School District operates two schools: Trona Elementary School and Trona High School. There is no junior high or middle school; instead, the high school houses 7th and 8th grades in addition to the traditional 9th through 12th grades. Course offerings at Trona High are supplemented by online classes offered by California State University, Dominguez Hills and Cerro Coso Community College in Ridgecrest, California. 95 students were enrolled at Trona High during the 2014-15 school year and its sports teams compete as the Tornadoes.

In 1706, he was named an ensign in the French Troupes de marine. Four years later, he was given command of the fort at Ile aux Tourtes. In 1718, a post was founded at Chequamegon by Paul le Gardeur, sieur de St. Pierre, with Godefroy de Linctot second in command. A settlement of Canadien traders was this year reported as existing at La Baye, in Wisconsin. Godefroy succeeded Le Gardeur as fort commander in 1720, remaining there until 1726. In 1731, at the end of the Fox Indian Wars, the Canadiens, under the command of Godefroy, returned to Trempealeau and established another trading post. In 1732, the post of La Baye was rebuilt under command of Nicolas Antoine Coulon de Villiers. Godefroy, with a company of fur traders, rebuilt the Lake Pepin post.

On July 31, 2007, he was traded from the Braves to the Texas Rangers along with Jarrod Saltalamacchia, Matt Harrison, Beau Jones, and Elvis Andrus for Mark Teixeira and Ron Mahay. He was the Rangers' best prospect according to Baseball America, and one of the top five pitching prospects in baseball at the start of 2010.

Location The Square Ren√© Viviani is a city park located slightly to the north of the Gothic church of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre, built at the same time as Notre-Dame Cathedral and consequently one of Paris' oldest churches. Disaffected during the Revolution, in the 19th century the ruinous church was taken over by the city's Greek Melchite Church and is today the center of that religious community in Paris. The Square is an irregular polygon in shape, bounded by the Rue Galande and church buildings to the south; by the Rue Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre on the west; by the Quai de Montebello to the north; and by the Rue Lagrange and the Rue du Fouarre on the east. The Rue de la B√ªcherie ends on the western side of the square, but it resumes its course on the eastern side, and the Pont au Double, a bridge to the √éle de la Cit√©, lies across the Quai de Montebello from the square. The Square Ren√© Viviani offers one of the best views of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in all of Paris. Around the corner, in the Rue de la B√ªcherie, stands the well-known English-language bookshop, Shakespeare and Company which took the name of Sylvia Beach's legendary bookshop and independent publishing house near the Place de l'Od√©on, which first published James Joyce's novel Ulysses and was a literary center for English writers until it was definitively closed when Germany occupied France. Inside the square, there are two features, other than the lawns, walkways, well-trimmed plane trees, and benches, that deserve a mention here. There is an odd-looking fountain, known as the Saint Julien fountain, that was erected in 1995. It is the work of the French sculptor, Georges Jeanclos (1933‚Äì1997), and it is emblematic of the legend of St. Julien the Hospitaller, a tale, now largely discounted, involving a curse by witches, a talking deer, a case of mistaken identity, an horrific crime, several improbable coincidences, and a supernatural intervention. The story was told and retold during the Middle Ages, and it became a favorite. Consequently, hospitals, hospices, and churches all over Europe adopted Julien as their patron. He was also a patron saint of hunters, innkeepers, and ferrymen; traveling pilgrims often prayed for his help in finding comfortable lodgings. The other feature worthy of note is an ancient tree that is surrounded by a circular curbstone. Its significance is described below. The oldest tree in Paris, a locust tree planted in 1601 History Before 1909, this plot was occupied by one of the annexes of the H√¥tel-Dieu, the ancient Paris hospital on the nearby √éle de la Cit√©. In even earlier times, monastic buildings, dormitories and a refectory belonging to the Clunesian priory of St. Julien, occupied this site. Earlier still, this place was a cemetery established next to a 6th-century basilica, the original Church of St. Julien. Merovingian-era graves and tombs were excavated near the walls of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre during the 19th century. Some of the relics are now in the Carnavalet Museum. Here and there on the square, there are odd pieces of carved stone. They are pieces of architectural rubble salvaged from the Cathedral of Notre Dame, when, during the 19th century, the exterior of the cathedral was partially restored by the architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc. Many of the most seriously degraded pieces of carved limestone were replaced by newly carved reproductions, and the older pieces were eventually deposited here. The square is noted for being the site of the oldest planted tree in Paris. The Robinia pseudoacacia, a species commonly known as a locust tree, is believed to have been planted by its namesake, Jean Robin (1550‚Äì1620), in 1601; if so, it has now been standing on the rive gauche for over four hundred years. It is supported by two concrete crutches. The tree lost its upper branches to a shell during World War I, but it proves its continuing vitality by blooming every year. Despite some speculation about its true age, it is universally recognized as the oldest tree in the city. Metro station The Square Ren√© Viviani is: It is served by lines 4 and 10. 18px 18px Ren√© Viviani Ren√© Viviani The Square Ren√© Viviani is named for the French political figure Ren√© Viviani (1863‚Äì1925) who, notably, was France's first Minister of Labour. After several old buildings standing on the site were cleared away in 1928, including an annex of the public hospital across the river, the empty space was arranged to be a public park.

Elwood Madill was an insurance agent in Orangeville, Ontario when he won the local Progressive Conservative nomination for the Dufferin‚ÄîSimcoe riding on 16 February 1963. Madill won that seat in the federal election later that year. He was re- elected to a second term in 1965. Due to riding boundary realignments in 1966, Madill campaigned in the newly formed Peel‚ÄîDufferin‚ÄîSimcoe riding in the 1968 election but lost to Bruce Beer of the Liberal party. Beer only served one term in Parliament before Madill won back Peel‚ÄîDufferin‚ÄîSimcoe in the 1972 federal election. However, after his term in the 29th Parliament, Madill left federal political office after his defeat to Ross Milne in the 1974 federal election. Besides his insurance practice, Madill was also a businessman and farmer during his career.

When only the forearm pads alone are used for performing abdominal exercises, the power tower requires minimal arm strength as it is stable and movement occurs in the hips and torso. The equipment commonly has a backrest and forearm rests that form the chair, with vertical handles at the ends of the arm rests. The word \\"power\\" comes from the addition of other powerful arm exercises such as parallel horizontal handles for performing dips, a pull-up bar attached to the top for chin-ups and pull-ups, and push-up handles that are usually found on the bottom for Atlas (\\"deep\\") push-ups. Exercises * Chin-ups, when one's forearms are parallel with palms facing the operator closer together than shoulder-width, are a common exercise. The user works to pull his body upwards until his chin is over the bar. Chin-ups work the biceps, forearms, chest, and several upper back muscles, particularly the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and rhomboid muscles. * Pull-ups, when one's grip is wide with the palms facing away from the user, are also common. One attempts to pull himself up and touch his chest to the pull-up bar. Pull-ups strongly involve the latissimus dorsi muscle. * Dips, exercises in which one 'dips' oneself between parallel bars, making sure to never bend the elbows less than 90 degrees, are also used to strengthen the triceps and chest. Keeping the torso vertical can increase the amount of use of many of the involved muscles. * Deep or Atlas pushups use the triceps and chest more thoroughly than standard pushups. The knee raise exercise will work the lower abdominals, and can also work the obliques (see abdominal external oblique muscle and abdominal internal oblique muscle) if one twists the torso during the exercise. This version of the knee raise has been praised by fitness communities for its effectiveness as working the abdominal muscles. Previous research has shown that a captain's chair knee raise will elicit a greater electromyography (EMG) response than the standard crunch. This means that the knee raise in the captain's chair will have more activation in the muscle than the standard crunch. However, 2013 research has shown that it has the same EMG activity as the standard crunch. This newer research is yet to be published. One aspect that both research agree on is that there is no difference in activation of upper rectus abdominis and lower rectus abdominis as it is speculated that the muscle acts as one and cannot be differentiated. Advanced users may increase resistance by wearing a weighted vest or ankle weights, holding a dumbbell between the feet, kettlebells on the toes, a resistance band tied from one's feet to the bottom of the tower, or other heavy weights.

The Shenandoah Packing company was established here in 1908, and canned 11,000 cans per season of apples, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and beans. Later a Post Office was erected there, but was named \\"Farland\\" because another post office in nearby Floyd County, Virginia, also had the name \\"Starkey.

Gizhigin Bay (Russian: Gizhiginskaya Guba) is a wide bay northwest of Kamchatka, Russia. It is the northwest arm of Shelikhov Bay in the northeast corner of the Sea of Okhotsk. The settlements of Evensk and Gizhiga are located at the head of the bay. Geography and climate Gizhigin Bay is entered between Cape Aregichinsky (60¬∞30' N, 155¬∞27' E) and Cape Taygonos (60¬∞34' N, 160¬∞11' E). The Taygonos Peninsula separates it from Penzhina Bay to the east. It is about 260 km (about 160 mi) west to east by 148 km (about 92 mi) north to south and has a maximum depth of 88 m (about 289 ft). The coast is steep and rocky and there are no completely safe anchorages within the bay. The Gizhiga River is about 145 km (about 90 mi) long and flows into the head of the bay. Spring tides rise 6.7 m (22 ft) at the entrance of the bay and 7.9 m (26 ft) at its head, while neaps rise 2.7 to 3.3 m (9 to 11 ft). The flood current sets to the north, while the ebb flows to the south. During spring tides these currents may reach up to 2.5 knots near Cape Taygonos. During the season of navigation the southeast part of the bay experiences dense fogs, with May and June being the foggiest months; in August, however, fog is rare. South winds are prevalent in the summer, while north winds are frequent in the fall and the first part of winter. Storms are common from the second half of September to November. In the winter, northwest winds prevail, which are interrupted by blizzards from the northeast. Gentle winds and calms occur in April and May.National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. (2014).

Joyce Riley Williams, Joy Williams Wiradjuri, Janaka Wiradjuri) (born 13 September 1942 in Sydney; died 22 September 2006 in Primbee, New South Wales, Australia) was an Aboriginal Australian author of poetry.  Biography  Joy Williams was born Eileen Williams at the Crown Street Women's Hospital in Sydney. Shortly after her birth Joy was taken from her mother by the Aboriginal Welfare Board and sent to the Bomaderry Aboriginal Children's Home. At the age of six she was sent to the Lutanda Children's Home run by the Plymouth Brethren, first at Wentworth Falls and later to Pennant Hills, Sydney. Williams was sent to Lutanda, where she was the only indigenous resident, rather than the Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls because of her fair skin. Williams went to Hornsby Girls' High School and then at the insistence of the Brethren was sent to the Nurses' Home at Parramatta District Hospital at sixteen to become a nurses aide. She was later sent to the North Ryde Psychiatric ward and while on weekend leave she became pregnant with her first child, a daughter. Being heavily sedated Williams was forced to sign adoption papers. In the 1970s Williams received her birth certificate and eventually met her mother. She enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts, English/History at Wollongong University and was the Regional Representative of the Aboriginal Consultative Group. Williams was actively involved with the Aboriginal Community Centre and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Her interest was in Black Literature and hoped that one day this would be taught at all levels throughout the education system. Williams was the first Aboriginal compensation test case against the NSW State Government for negligence by the Aboriginal Welfare Board who were responsible for her removal from her mother and the abuse she endured from the Homes she was sent to. She lost her case in the Supreme Court in August 1999. In 2000 Joy went to the New South Wales Court of Appeal; her case was heard by Chief Justice Spigelman, Justice Shellar and Justice Heydon and lost that also. On 22 June 2001 the High Court rejected an application for further leave to appeal.  Writing  * Blackberry's Child. Sydney, New South Wales : Breakout Press, 1991.

Natural history Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge is along the southernmost portion of the lower Mississippi River, which does not have levees. It experiences floods most years. The refuge is home to many species, including the federally listed Louisiana black bear. The Mississippi River is a major bird migration corridor; it is located within an area of high importance for neotropical migratory birds, including the swallow-tailed kite, which is a species of special concern.

Heaven reluctantly cuts Jake's rope sending him falling backward down the mountain. Heaven stays frozen until Severin orders her to climbing so that Jake wouldn't have died in vain. However, Heaven and Severin are not successful in gaining the mirror and return home with nothing. Soon after, Jake, who survived the fall, returns with the mirror and a captured Sato. Otto and Cheryl tell Heaven of Karen's true identity, and Heaven becomes suspicious of her (without evidence) and refuses to confront Jake. After a botched sting operation to uncover Tasuke's money launderer, known only as Sonia, Karen stabs Sato and cuts herself to make it look like he escaped. Part 6 After stabbing Jake, Karen beats up Heaven and kidnaps Cheryl. After seeing Jake at the hospital, she leaves for a location outside Kyoto, Japan. Meanwhile, Severin is interrogating Tasuke, who was arrested in a planned sting, during which he tells the history of the Morishi Protocol which included an underground bidding war. Heaven ends up killing Jake's ex and survives the Morishi Protocol even though her destiny was to die in the end for a person to survive. Heaven, Cheryl, and Severin return to the loft to find that Jake left. Five months later, we find Heaven working as a waitress. Otto brings Heaven a letter from Jake. At the end, on the way home, Heaven comes across Sato and is quickly surrounded by a gang of ninjas and she prepares to fight them.

The Perilous West. Lanham, MD: Row & Littlefield Publishing. 2013, p. 67. was started by the notable fur trader Manuel Lisa of the Missouri Fur Company in 1809. This fort was likely where Sacagawea died; she had been the guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Fort Lisa superseded Fort Raymond as the uppermost post of the Missouri Fur Company on the Missouri River. In 1812 Lisa built a replacement fort downriver near present-day North Omaha, Nebraska, which he also named Fort Lisa. History In the winter of 1807, Lisa opened Fort Raymond at the mouth of the Bighorn River in modern Montana. After returning to St. Louis the following year, he formed the Missouri Fur Company with local luminaries such as William Clark and members of the Chouteau family, founders of St. Louis. With company assets allowing a large party of 300 men, Lisa left in 1809 on a fur expedition in the north. After visiting Fort Raymond, he built a new station named Fort Lisa and shifted operations to the new post. The new station was located near a Gros Ventres of the Missouri (Hidatsa) village, in between the mouth of the Little Missouri and that of the Knife rivers in what is now North Dakota. During its first year of operation Pierre Dorion, Jr., his common law wife Marie Aioe Dorion and family resided at the station.Irving, Washington. Astoria.

Price Hunt after making an agreement with Lisa to purchase horses. Fort Lisa was noted to have minimal food supplies at the time. Lisa arrived at the fur trading post on the 25th of June and finalised the transaction with Crooks. Crooks and his employees departed the following day to the Arikara nation, where the majority of the PFC workforce was residing.Bradbury (1817), p. 148. Sacagawea Henry Brackenridge during 1811 wrote in his journal that Sacagawea, the notable Native American guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was living at Fort Lisa with her husband Charbonneau. He wrote that Sacagawea \\"...had become sickly and longed to revisit her native country.\\" The following year, John Luttig, a clerk at Fort Manuel Lisa, recorded in his journal on December 20, 1812, that \\"...the wife of Charbonneau, a Snake Squaw, died of putrid fever.\\" (Note: Often called childbed fever, this was a frequent complication of childbirth.)

Chung has appeared with professional wrestling promotions such as Border City Wrestling, IWA Mid-South, Ring of Honor and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla. Wrestlers she has managed include Frankie Kazarian, Jimmy Rave, Nate Mattson, Conrad Kennedy III, A-1, Scorpio Sky, Mr. Hughes and Shane Douglas. Modeling career Born in Guelph, Ontario of Chinese Vietnamese descent, Chung started modeling at the age of 12 as a runway model and appeared in cover stories for several fashion magazines while modeling in Vietnam. In 2002, she won the \\"Cover Girl\\" title from the Vietnamese fashion magazine Thoi Moi in 2002 and appeared on the cover of two other Vietnamese fashion magazines the following year. Chung was also one of 500 models selected to represent ImportFest 2003 in Toronto and was a top ten finalist in the 2004 Miss Viet Canada Pageant. She also starred as an extra in Ashanti's \\"Rain on Me\\" music video. Professional wrestling career A wrestling fan as a child, she often watched the World Wrestling Federation well into high school. Chung was encouraged to enter professional wrestling after meeting Beth Phoenix and Traci Brooks at a local wrestling event and spent her summers training at Rob Fuego's Toronto-based wrestling school Squared Circle Training. Having some personal friends already in professional wrestling, she later attended local independent shows in hopes of getting hired full-time. She eventually made her professional debut for wrestler/promoter Scott D'Amore's Border City Wrestling where, in September 2003, she managed \\"Franchise\\" Shane Douglas to win the BCW Can-Am Heavyweight Championship from D-Lo Brown. She would spend the next two years in various independent promotions in Canada and the United States. At A Night of Appreciation for Sabu, she was in the corner of A-1 when he defeated D-Lo Brown to win the BCW Can-Am Heavyweight Championship in Belleville, Michigan on December 12, 2004. Ring of Honor BCW Can-Am Heavyweight Champion A-1 in December 2004 In early 2005, Jade Chung made her debut in Ring of Honor as a valet for manager Prince Nana's stable The Embassy replacing Angel Williams. Although part of one of the top factions in the promotion, Chung was used as a footstool for members of the stable, particularly Jimmy Rave. She was in the corner of Jimmy Rave when he defeated CM Punk in a dog collar match at Manhattan Mayhem on May 31. During the match, she was one of several members of The Embassy to interfere in the match and, at one point, she had entered the ring to apply a sleeper hold on CM Punk. After Jimmy Rave lost to Roderick Strong on October 1, Jade left The Embassy to become the manager of Generation Next in their feud with The Embassy. The following night, she interfered in a match between Jimmy Rave and Matt Sydal costing him the match. She continued to feud with rival manager Prince Nana and, during a match on October 29, she attacked him with a tilt-a-whirl DDT. On November 5, Ring of Honor announced that Chung had been attacked by an unidentified man in the parking lot. A still photo of Jimmy Rave was shown on November 19 attacking Chung and the promotion claimed that she was no longer involved in wrestling. The feud was finally concluded at Steel Cage Warfare when she made a surprise appearance during the main event, an 8-man Steel Cage Warfare match between The Embassy (Jimmy Rave, Abyss, Alex Shelley and Prince Nana) vs. Generation Next (Roderick Strong, Matt Sydal, Austin Aries and Jack Evans). Chung, who appeared with bandages as a result of her attack by Jimmy Rave, distracted The Embassy long enough for Jack Evans to enter the match and perform a double moonsault off the top off the cage. After Generation Next defeated The Embassy, Chung used Jimmy Rave as her own footstool during the in-ring celebration after the match. Pro Wrestling Guerrilla In March 2006, she appeared as the manager of the Dark & Lovely (Human Tornado and Scorpio Sky). She also made an appearance at All Pro Wrestling's Gym Wars, being in the corner of B-Boy in his defeat against MPT, and for Battle Ground Wrestling with Scott Lost losing a match to Foob Dogg for a lifetime contract with the company. She also managed Joey Ryan in single matches during the same time in PWG. On October 7, Chung participated in a \\"First Blood Handicap\\" match with Scorpio Sky, teaming as the Scorpio Sky Experience, to defeat Frankie Kazarian. A month later, her stable (Scorpio Sky, Chris Bosh, Scott Lost & Joey Ryan) lost an 8-man tag team match against Candice LeRae's team (Frankie Kazarian, Human Tornado, El Generico and Quicksilver). She eventually turned on Scorpio Sky after he lost a \\"Loser Leaves PWG\\" match to Frankie Kazarian on January 27, 2007. At the NWA supercard Bloodlust! 3, she and Kitana Vera defeated Candice LeRae & Carla Jade in a tag team match in Covina, California on November 9. She continued to appear with Scott Lost & Joey Ryan and was in their corner at the first supercard for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla as they faced The Age of the Fall (Tyler Black and Jimmy Jacobs) at PWG All Star Weekend 6, Night 1 in Van Nuys, California on January 5, 2008. On March 21, Chung was injured by Super Dragon during a tag team match between The Dynasty and Kevin Steen and El Generico. She was forced to take a leave of absence and, as a result, Scott Lost and Joey Ryan lost several opportunities to win the PWG Tag Team titles in matches against El Blazer and Kagetora and Los Luchas (Phoenix Star and Zokre).

After a search for his owner, it was found that his name was Powder and that he was abandoned by Donna Oklatner, an elderly Voorhees resident. Oklatner claimed she could not afford to take care of the cat when she lost her home in foreclosure proceedings. He was later adopted from the Camden County Animal Shelter in New Jersey by Donna Damiani of Blackwood, New Jersey, and in August 2008 his weight was already down to 22 pounds. According to the Guinness World Records, the largest tabby cat was forty-six pounds and fifteen ounces. Since then, the publishers have dropped the category to prevent deliberate overfeeding and possible harm to cats. He made television appearances on Live with Regis and Kelly, Good Morning America, Fox News, and MSNBC, based on his reported weight, but reliable sources of the cat's definitive weight in July 2008 are not available. One paper reported that \\"shelter officials said they were perplexed by the discrepancy\\", after the Damiani family found that the cat weighed just over 22 pounds, \\"days after\\" receiving him. The Damiani family later founded the Prince Chunk Foundation, a nonprofit that allows people to keep their pets in difficult financial situations by giving them free pet food and vet care.

Plot Cliff Addison (Martin Donovan) and his wife, Abby (Julia Benson), have a road accident. He walks away unharmed, but she is left in a coma with her skin burned off. Cliff is told that there is a method of surgery that will allow her to live, but without speech or the ability to take care of herself. Cliff consults with his attorney, Ira, who persuades him to let his wife die. He reveals to Ira that he had an affair. Cliff remembers an instance where his wife found his cell phone with a video of his mistress, Trish (Robin Sydney), stripping whilst moaning his name. Shortly after, Cliff hallucinates that he is taking a bath with his wife and they make love while her skin burns off. While he panics, it is shown that his wife had died but was resuscitated, and that he has a hand-shaped burn mark on his back. Cliff runs into Trish, and it's revealed that she had been fired by Abby, and only slept with Cliff out of pity. Cliff visits Abby and attempts to kiss her. Her eyes open and she begins to flatline. Cliff then learns that she had flatlined two nights ago, but was brought back. Abby's ghost brutally kills Cliff's attorney. Cliff returns home to see a drunken Trish and they have sex. In bed, Cliff tells Trish that in four hours, without the skin transplant, Abby will die, as will he. Cliff's phone rings, showing he is receiving seductive pictures of Trish, but sees Abby's skinless figure approaching from behind her. Trish screams, making Cliff rush to her and comfort her. He then breaks a bottle over her head. We next see a naked Trish strapped in the dentist chair, being prepped by Cliff to have her skin transferred to Abby. He informs her that he regrets that she has to be alive for the procedure, but the skin has to be fresh. In her heavily-drugged state, she feels no pain. Cliff thinks back to the drive before the accident. Abby revealed that she was pregnant. Cliff was apparently overjoyed, but Abby said that she was going to leave him because of the affair and never let him see the baby. Because of their argument, Cliff had taken his eyes off the road, which led to their crash. The beginning scene is replayed, but it is shown that Cliff made a conscious decision to not call 911. She apologized for being harsh to him, but he purposely set the car on fire. Almost immediately, he regretted his decision as she screamed in agony. Back to the present, Cliff arrives at the hospital with the skin, but finds that Abby has already died. He throws away Trish's body pieces, then goes home to be greeted by Abby's spirit.

She spent decades clearing the names of her husband Giuseppe and son Gerry over the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) pub bombings at Guildford and Woolwich, and helped secure an apology from former British prime minister Tony Blair in 2005 for their wrongful imprisonment. Guildford pub bombings In 1974, an IRA unit planted bombs in two pubs in Guildford, Surrey, killing four soldiers and one civilian, and injured 50 others. Gerard Conlon, Patrick Armstrong, Paul Hill and Carole Richardson, dubbed as \\"the Guildford Four\\", were arrested, convicted, and jailed for life in 1975, with each serving 15 years in jail before their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal, after an extensive inquiry carried out by Avon and Somerset Police into the original police investigation. The inquiry found that the way the confessions of the four were noted was seriously flawed, concluding that the notes taken were not written up immediately and that officers may have colluded in the wording of the statements. Giuseppe Conlon, Sarah's husband, was convicted in 1976 along with six members of the Maguire family, dubbed as the Maguire Seven, of running an IRA bomb factory in North London, on the basis of what turned out to be faulty forensic evidence. Each was sentenced to up to 14 years in jail, served their sentences, and with the exception of Giuseppe Conlon who died in 1980, released. The Maguire Seven's first appeal, in 1977, was turned down, but a later appeal, prompted by the release of the Guildford Four, found that test kits used to detect traces of explosives had been contaminated. In 1991, the Court of Appeal quashed their convictions after it was ruled the original evidence against them was unsafe. On 9 February 2005, then Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a public apology to the Maguire Seven and the Guildford Four for the miscarriages of justice they had suffered, saying that he was \\"very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and such an injustice\\", and that \\"they deserve to be completely and publicly exonerated.\\" The 1993 film In the Name of the Father, while changing some of the details of the cases from real life, showed how the Maguire Seven and Guildford Four became victims of a police force desperate to obtain a conviction under any circumstances to appease an upset public and senior justice officials. Role in the sentences and appeals Sarah Conlon won huge admiration in Ireland for her quiet dignity and refusal to feel bitterness. During the years that her husband and son were in jail, she sent weekly parcels of cigarettes, sweets, and Irish newspaper clippings to them, and saved up her prison visits for the two weeks of her annual holiday. Her regular letters to them always ended the same way: \\"Pray for them ones who told lies against you... It's them who needs help as well as yourself.\\" Father McKinley, a priest who noticed Sarah crying after the 1977 appeal was turned down, and others helped her begin a campaign to free her husband, son and other members of the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven. She took to lobbying dignitaries, church leaders and the media, in addition to writing to numerous Irish politicians, including the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) members of parliament Joe Hendron and John Hume, to ask for their support. At one stage she travelled to London to meet Cardinal Basil Hume to ask for his assistance. Her campaigning led to the start of the aforementioned inquiry, announced in 1989 by the home secretary Douglas Hurd, into the Guildford bomb cases, which led to Gerry's release. News of her husband's death reached Sarah just after she received a message from home secretary Willie Whitelaw stating that her husband was about to be released on compassionate grounds. Twenty-five years after her husband's death, Sarah Conlon and her family decided to fight for a public apology for the miscarriage of justice on her family. Once again she led the campaign, lobbying church leaders and politicians, among them the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who pledged his support, which culminated in Tony Blair's apology to the Conlon family. Ill, she was unable to make the trip to London to hear the apology, but her children spoke to her by telephone from the House of Commons. After securing the apology, she mentioned that she no longer had to worry about dying and what it means. SDLP leader and Foyle member of parliament Mark Durkan described Sarah as \\"a true heroine of our age\\" and \\"shining example to us all\\", saying that she had the \\"patience of a saint\\" and \\"huge reserves of faith, fortitude and remarkable forgiveness\\", and that \\"her story is an inspiration of faith, hope and love\\". Personal life Conlon was described as a woman of \\"immense Catholic faith\\" who was protective of her son Gerry, and who held the family together with her hard work, wanting their life to be respectable, holy, and quiet. She spent years working at a scrapyard sorting old clothes, and later worked long hours for low pay in the kitchens of the Royal Victoria Hospital, serving food to patients and mopping the floors. Conlon's husband, Patrick \\"Giuseppe\\", was a pacifist who evaded the draft during World War II. He once worked at Harland & Wolf painting the hulls of ships, where the lead in the paint damaged his lungs. His condition was worsened by the humidity and condensation in the house, and he subsequently developed tuberculosis and emphysema. Sarah Conlon died of lung cancer in July 2008, aged 82. In popular culture The film In the Name of the Father (1993), directed by Jim Sheridan and starring Daniel Day-Lewis, is based on the Conlon family's story. Actress Marie Jones portrayed Sarah Conlon. The film was adapted from Gerry Conlon's autobiography Proved Innocent, later published as In the Name of the Father. The 1990 made-for-television film Dear Sarah is based on the letters Giuseppe Conlon wrote to his wife while in prison. The film was produced by Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann, directed by Frank Cvitanovich and written by Tom McGurk. It featured Stella McCusker as Sarah Conlon.

Churchill () is a Native American artist of Haida descent. She is a weaver of baskets, hats, robes, and other regalia, as well as leading revitalization efforts for Haida, her native language. Background Churchill was born in Masset, Queen Charlotte Islands (now Haida Gwaii) in British Columbia, Canada in 1929. As a girl, she attended residential schools that forced her to speak English in place of her native tongue, a typical practice of that time period. She first studied traditional Haida weaving with her mother, Selina Peratrovich, who is also a nationally recognized master weaver. She went on to study traditional Tsimshian weaving from masters Flora Matthew and Brenda White. Churchill further studied at the British Museum and relearned the six-strand weave. After retiring from a bookkeeping career and raising her family, Churchill turned her attention back to basketry at a time when Haida basket weaving was in serious decline as an art form among younger members of the tribe. She taught her niece, Lisa Telford, traditional Haida basket weaving. Artwork Churchill is known for her utilitarian and ceremonial objects that often use spruce root, cedar bark, wool, and natural dyes. Some of her artwork is displayed at the Totem Heritage Center in Ketchikan, Alaska, where she has also taught courses in basketry.http://www.city.ketchikan.ak.us/departments/museums/documents/InstructorBiosforweb.pdf  Haida language revitalization  As one of the few remaining native speakers of Haida, Churchill has fought to share her linguistic heritage. Canada and the United States both suppressed use of the Haida language, especially through forcing Native children to speak English in boarding schools. Churchill was forced by her teachers in the Canadian residential school she attended as a child to speak English and was punished for speaking her own language. Despite these challenges, Churchill has remained adamant in her desire to preserve her native language and frequently works with Haida children and assisted her daughter April Churchill's language revitalization.

Life Pauline was born in Berlin while her parents were living in exile during the time the Low Countries were occupied by France. She was the third child and first-born daughter of the later King William I of the Netherlands and his wife, Wilhelmine of Prussia. Her two older brothers were the future King William II and Prince Frederick of the Netherlands. Her parents had another, stillborn, child in 1795. Her younger sister, Marianne, was born four years after her death. In 1803 Pauline and her family moved to the Nassau family estates in Germany. Here she met her paternal grandparents for the first time. They quickly became fond of her, and Pauline's grandfather William V nicknamed her Polly. Particularly her grandfather was very happy to see her, because none of the recent Nassau-Orange rulers had seen a granddaughter in their lifetime. During a ball in celebration of the birthday of Princess Pauline's father, the old obese ex-Prince danced with Pauline in the grand ballroom of the castle. From 1804 the family lived with William V in Berlin, where he had bought a palace on the Unter den Linden (No. 36). The palace is known as the Niederl√§ndische Palais(the Netherlands Palace). At the age of five, she and her older brothers began to spend more time with their grandparents in Oranienstein. In August 1806, her parents had another stillborn son. Berlin was occupied by the French on 27 October 1806 and K√ºstrin on 1 November. The Prussian army under the command of Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher finally capitulated on 7 November. Her father, who had become a prisoner of war after the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt on 14 October, was released on this occasion. In October 1806, Pauline with her mother and brothers left Berlin for K√∂nigsberg to escape the French troops. From birth, she had poor health, probably due to the difficult circumstances during her mother's pregnancy. According to doctors, she suffered from some kind of nervous fever. Due to bad weather while fleeing Berlin, Pauline's health quickly declined. On 15 December 1806 her condition became alarming; she died a week later, on 22 December. Her mother could hardly be separated from her deathbed and there were fears for her sanity. According to some sources Pauline died at the home of a mayor who had housed the family temporarily; according to others, she died on the Freienwalde, one of the royal Prussian possessions west of Berlin near the Oder.Prussian Castles - Schloss Freienwalde This estate had been recently occupied by Princess Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, her maternal grandmother. Pauline was definitely buried on the Freienwalde estate. A monument by sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow was put in place only in 1813.Image of the monument in Freienwalde The neglected grave was rediscovered by the new owner of Freienwalde, Walther Rathenau in 1909. He discovered a weathered gravestone on the estate, inscribed with Pauline's name. The news was immediately reported to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who had the remains exhumed. Without much pomp Pauline's remains were brought to the Netherlands by the Dutch ambassador in Berlin, Baron Gevers, and the chamberlain Van den Bosch in March 1911. During this trip, the bronze casket was placed with the luggage. On 7 April 1911 Pauline's remains finally were interred in the Royal Crypt in the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft. The text of her gravestone reads: \\"Grabmal of Friderike Louise Pauline Charlotte Wilhelmine Prinzessin von Nassau und Oranien - Born zu Berlin den 1 Maerz 1800 - died zu Freienwalde 22d Dezember 1806\\".Photography of her current tomb in Delft AncestryReferences *J.J.

History  Five Sisters of Mercy, members of the Brisbane Congregation, arrived in Townsville in 1878. They began their ministry from a 'cottage on the shores of Cleveland Bay'. In 1882, Rockhampton was declared a Diocese and the Townsville group was governed from there until 1901, when the group became self-governing with the formation of a Townsville Congregation. Thirteen Sisters were foundation members made up of Sisters from the Brisbane and Rockhampton Congregations who chose to stay in the North. Over the years the number of Sisters grew and their ministries diversified. Care of sick people was a well-established tradition among Sisters of Mercy, and in keeping with that, the decision was made in 1945 to establish a Catholic hospital in Townsville. A small private hospital in Stagpole Street, known as 'The Lister', was purchased and the Townsville Sisters of Mercy moved formally into Health Care ministry. The hospital was renamed the 'Mater Misericordiae' (Mother of Mercy), the title given to all hospitals operated by the Sisters of Mercy. When this hospital was found to be inadequate to meet the demands of modern health care, a property was purchased in Fulham Road and a new 50-bed hospital was opened in 1962. The transfer to the new hospital was made possible by the support given to the Sisters of Mercy by local fund raisers.

After beginning with Triple-A Richmond, Bueno was called up to the majors on August 3 and made his debut on August 13, during which he nearly hit Alfonso Soriano in the chin, only innings after Soriano show-boated after hitting a long fly ball off Bueno, jumping and celebrating out of the box, only to be left with a single as the ball bounced off the left field wall. Bueno was ejected, along with bench coach Chino Cadahia. A day later, Bueno was given a fine and three-day suspension by Major League Baseball. Bueno will appeal the fine and suspension, and will only have to serve his final sentence once he returns to the Major Leagues.

Because of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, she was cut in half shortly before completion and transported to Ogdensburg, New York for service on the Atlantic coast although the war ended before she could be put into service. After the formation of the United States Coast Guard in 1915 she became USCGC Onondaga. She served as a patrol vessel at various Atlantic coast ports before World War I and unlike most Coast Guard cutters during World War I, she remained under the control of the Commandant of the Coast Guard. After the war she patrolled for a brief time based at New London, Connecticut before being decommissioned in 1923. Construction The United States Revenue Cutter Service cutter Onondaga was laid down in 1897 at the Globe Iron Workss yard in Cleveland (yard number 72) and launched on 23 December 1897, with Miss Louis Augusta Allen being the sponsor. She was a steel-hulled vessel equipped with a triple-expansion steam engine, Scotch boilers, and a single screw. She was one of the first RCS cutters built with electric generators to supply current for lights and call bells.\\"Onondaga, 1898\\", Cutters, Craft & U.S. Coast Guard-Manned Army & Navy Vessels, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's OfficeEvans, p 158 Before Onondaga could be completed, she was transferred to U.S. Navy control because of the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War on 24 March 1898 and the contractor was directed to cut the ship in half for transport to Ogdensburg, New York. She was reassembled and was finally accepted for service by the government 13 August and returned to Department of the Treasury control on 17 August at the conclusion of hostilities. She was placed in commission 24 October at Ogdensburg and ordered to report for duty at Boston, Massachusetts. History=1899‚Äì1917 After Onondaga arrived at Boston, she received winter cruising orders to patrol the area from the St. Croix River to Nantucket Shoals. During February 1899, she was tasked with breaking ice in the harbor at Sullivan, Maine. On 8 December 1899, she received orders transferring her to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a patrol area set from Great Egg Harbor to Fort Monroe, Virginia, including Delaware Bay. While stationed at Philadelphia, she also had a temporary assignment escorting Marine Hospital Service ship Senator from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Havana, Cuba, in June 1900. In September 1900 she was temporarily assigned to Galveston, Texas. Onondaga was also used to cover other Revenue Cutter Servie cutters‚Ä≤ patrol areas when they were laid up for repairs. On 1 July 1902, Onondaga conveyed Maine United States Senator William P. Frye and his party from New York City to Portland, Maine. On 7 April 1904, she received orders to return to Galveston, Texas, and tow USRC Galveston to the Revenue Cutter Service Depot at Curtis Bay, Maryland, for major repairs. On 10 December 1904, the tug Boxer collided with Onondaga at Philadelphia, striking her stern and necessitating that Onondaga undergo extensive repairs at Kensington Shipyard Company in Philadelphia. Repairs were completed 7 February 1905, and she departed for Norfolk, Virginia, to patrol for the remainder of her winter cruise.Record of Movements, p 52 On 11 November 1905 she was notified that all winter patrols were to be based out of Norfolk while summer patrols were to be conducted out of Philadelphia. After 13 April 1907, all patrols were based out of Norfolk, with occasional temporary duty at Tompkinsville on Staten Island, New York, while the cutters normally stationed there were in shipyards for repairs.Record of Movements, p 53 On 29 October 1907 she had a wireless telegraph installed at Norfolk.Record of Movements, p 54 On 7 June 1909, Onondaga was placed out of commission at the Revenue Cutter Service Depot for repairs. She sailed without commission to Norfolk for additional repairs and returned to the Revenue Cutter Service Depot 30 September 1909. Repairs were completed 6 November 1909, and she recommissioned and returned to normal patrol duties. On 6 March 1910, assisted by Onondaga, towed the abandoned and waterlogged four-masted schooner Asbury Fountain to Norfolk after Asbury Fountain collided with the steamer SS Jamestown.King, p 143 On 23 May 1912, Onondaga was at Philadelphia, representing the Revenue Cutter Service at the convention of the Permanent International Association of Navigation Congresses. On 9 May 1913, Onondaga received United States Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo and his party aboard for a cruise from Baltimore, Maryland, to Richmond, Virginia.Record of Movements, p 55 On 9 October 1913, the steel-hulled bark Manga Reva departed Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, bound for San Francisco, California, via Cape Horn with a cargo of coal, but about a week after she cleared Delaware Bay, her crew of 28 men mutinied while she was in the Atlantic Ocean east of Bermuda. The mutineers forced her captain and other officers to sail her back toward Philadelphia. On 9 November 1913, she anchored inside the breakwater off Lewes, Delaware, in the midst of a gale. The weather prevented the pilot who came aboard from guiding her up the Delaware Bay to Philadelphia, and as he disembarked Manga Reva‚Ä≤s captain, despite warnings from the mutineers not to mention the mutiny, slipped him a note asking for help. The pilot notified the Philadelphia Navy Yard at League Island in Philadelphia of the mutiny, and the navy yard promptly radioed Onondaga. In response, Onondaga made for Lewes at full speed. With a small crowd of onlookers from Lewes using telescopes to observe the action from the beach, Onondaga arrived on the scene on 10 November 1913 and fastened herself to Manga Reva with grappling hooks. Members of Onondaga‚Ä≤s crew leaped over the rail and onto the deck of Manga Reva and found the mutineers gathered on Manga Reva‚Ä≤s quarterdeck armed with sheath knives and other weapons they had found, shouting defiance at Onondaga‚Ä≤s crew. More Onondaga crewmen came aboard Manga Reva armed with rifles and fixed bayonets. The mutineers, intoxicated from drinking Manga Reva‚Ä≤s liquor supply overnight, retreated, and within five minutes, and with no shots fired, Onondaga‚Ä≤s crew brought the mutiny to an end and arrested the mutineers.newspaper abstracts.com \\"Mutiny On The Magna Reva Ended By The Revenue Cutter Onondaga,\\" New York Times, 10 November 1913 Retrieved 2 September 2018newspaperabstracts.com \\"Revenue Cutter Crew Nab Ship Mutineers,\\" The Washington Post, 16 November 1913 Retrieved 2 September 2018Morgan, Michael, \\"A Mutiny on a Ship Ended at Delaware Breakwater,\\" Delaware Wave, 28 August 2018, p. 37. On 5 August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I in Europe, Onondaga was authorized for duty in enforcing neutrality laws in the Chesapeake Bay area. On 19 October 1914 she was placed out of commission at the Revenue Cutter Service Depot for overhaul, and her crew transferred to the Revenue Cutter Service Academy training ship USRC ItascaRecord of Movements, p 56 When the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the United States Life-Saving Service to form the United States Coast Guard on 28 January 1915, Onondaga became a United States Coast Guard cutter, designated as USCGC Onondaga.\\"U.S. Coast Guard General Order No. 1\\", Historic Documents & Publications, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office She was recommissioned on 29 January 1915 and her crew returned to her from Itasca. In the spring of 1915, the Italian steamer Verona arrived at the immigration station at Cape Henlopen, Delaware, carrying several hundred immigrants and, after immigration authorities discovered a suspected case of smallpox on board, the immigrants were confined to the quarantine station at Cape Henlopen.Morgan, Michael, \\"Hidden History of Lewes,\\" Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2014, , pp.97‚Äì98. Retrieved 31 July 2018 Many of the immigrants were eager to reach New York City in time to celebrate Easter Sunday with relatives on 4 April 1915, and about 200 of them pushed through the wire and past the guards at the quarantine station and arrived at the train station away in Lewes, demanding tickets to Philadelphia, but the station manager held them at bay with a pistol. Onondaga arrived at Lewes and disembarked a detachment of 50 United States Marines carrying rifles with fixed bayonets, prompting the unarmed immigrants to return to the quarantine station. The following day, a steamer arrived to take the immigrants to Philadelphia. During the summer of 1915, Lieutenants Elmer F. Stone and Norman B. Hall of Onondaga proposed the use of airplanes to increase the search capabilities of the cutter in locating overdue fishing schooners. With the approval of Onondaga‚Ä≤s commanding officer, Captain Benjamin M. Chiswell, they flew scouting missions in an airplane loaned to them by a representative of the Curtiss Aeroplane Company.Register of the officers, vessels and stations of the United States Coast Guard, 1 August 1915, U.S. Government Printing Office, p 58Evans, p 188Larzelere, pp 137‚Äì138 On 16 October 1915, Onondaga was assigned a winter patrol area from Great Egg Harbor, New Jersey, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with a home port of Cape Lookout, North Carolina. On 17 October 1916 her patrol area was changed to Cape Romain, South Carolina, to Cape Canaveral, Florida, with her home port at Savannah, Georgia. She patrolled this area until being recalled to the United States Coast Guard Depot on 31 March 1917. On 5 April 1917 she was decommissioned in preparation for transfer to the United States Navy for service in World War I. World War I After 6 April 1917, the Coast Guard was placed under the control of the Department of the Navy by executive order; however, Onondaga was unique among the cutters in the Coast Guard in that she was never assigned to a naval district commandant but instead received her orders directly from the Commandant of the Coast Guard. After re-commissioning on 18 May 1917, she sailed for New London, Connecticut where Captain Frederick C. Billard, also superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy, took command of her. Onondaga was used to convoy vessels turned over for use by the Coast Guard during the war from one port to another and to transfer personnel between units.Larzelere, p 93 She also was used to train newly recruited enlistees and cadets at the Academy and for towing disabled vessels to shipyards for repair.Kroll, p 113Larzelere, p 97 On 20 February 1918, Onondaga rescued the entire crew of the British steamship after she foundered on Diamond Shoals off the North Carolina coast. Captain Billard maneuvered Onondaga close by the grounded Veturia in heavy seas and dense fog and one of the small boats from Onondaga made seven trips rescuing the stranded crew of the grounded ship. Captain Billard and his crew received a commendation from the British Admiralty. The owners of the Veturia, Gow, Harrison and Company, sent a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, expressing appreciation for the rescue.Larzelere, pp 98‚Äì99 While on patrol near Montauk Point on 13 March 1918, she came to the aid of SS Kershaw, taking some of the crew off the stricken ship and placing them aboard . Post-war service and decommissioning On 28 August 1919 the Coast Guard was returned to Department of the Treasury control. Onondaga continued patrol operations based out of New London until 1920, at which time she transferred to Baltimore. She continued to operate out of Baltimore until 1 January 1923, when she was placed out of commission at the Coast Guard Depot for repairs. Funding for needed repairs was never received and her condition gradually deteriorated to the point where she had to be sold for scrap.Johnson, p 67 She was sold 16 September 1924 to Charles A.

It was one of the ventures of Laurens Hammond, the inventor of the famous Hammond organ. Invention of the Hammond clock motor Back of a Hammond clock with the characteristic starting knobAs Stuyvesant Barry reports in his biography of Laurens Hammond,See Stuyvesant Barry, Hammond as in Organ: The Laurens Hammond Story, chap. XII: \\"The Electric Clock.\\" The work remains unpublished but is available on the web at The Hammond Organ Story. Hammond himself acknowledged that his invention of the clock that was to bear his name was inspired by the success of Henry Warren's Telechron clocks. Upon discovering the Telechron technology, Hammond designed a motor that was synchronous, like Warren's, that is to say, it rotated at a speed that was tied to the frequency of the current supplied by the power grid. In this way, any clock operated by such a motor would run with great precision as long as the operators of the power grid kept the current's frequency constant. This had become possible since the introduction of the Warren master clock, an innovation of which Hammond took full advantage with his own invention.See the article on Telechron for an explanation of the Warren master clock. Hammond's motor, however, differed from Warren's in a number of respects: above all, it ran more slowly and was not self-starting. (Warren had patented his self-starting technology.) The latter Hammond did not consider to be a disadvantage; he believed that people would be misled by their clocks if they restarted automatically after a power outage.Warren tried to prevent this problem through his \\"indicating device,\\" the red dot that would appear on the dial after a power failure. The \\"indicating device\\" is explained in the article on Telechron. As Hammond's new clock motor was not self-starting, his clocks possessed a characteristic little knob on the back that one had to spin to start the motor. The company Due to its distinctive art deco skyscraper design, the \\"Gregory\\" is the most famous and popular clock among Hammond collectors.The Hammond clock model \\"Como\\"The Hammond Clock Company was founded in 1928 to produce and market clocks that were equipped with Hammond's new motor. The Hammond clock factory manufactured more than 100 different clock models, some simple and cheap, others made from expensive materials such as marble and onyx.Some of them can be seen on the following website: http://www.organhouse.com/hammond_products.htm Hammond employed well-paid toolmakers who created sophisticated tools to stamp out the various components of his clocks, which could then be assembled in a belt operation by unskilled laborers.See Hammond as in Organ, chap. XII. In addition, Hammond licensed his invention to other clock makers such as Waterbury, Sessions, and Ingraham. In 1932, the economic troubles of the Great Depression threatened the clock-making industry; about 150 clock companies went out of business. To make matters worse, Hammond's licensees discovered that Hammond's patent on his motor was invalid, due to an earlier German invention of the same technology. In this situation, Hammond attempted to save his factory by starting the production of an electric bridge table.Images of the bridge table can be seen here: http://www.organhouse.com/bridgetable.htm. This proved to be nothing but a fleeting success. Hammond did finally manage to save his company with his invention of the Hammond organ, and from 1937 his company was called The Hammond Instrument Company to reflect the new emphasis. The production of clocks was discontinued entirely in 1941. NotesFurther reading There is less literature on the Hammond clocks than on the Telechrons. Apart from some websites, such as the ones referred to in the notes, one may consult Spin to Start, the newsletter of the Synchronous Society, which was devoted to the collection of Hammond clocks. Only two issues have appeared, however: vol. 1, no. 1 (October 1996) and vol. 1, no. 2 (February 1998).

He played for more than seven decades and performed with many artists, including Robert Lockwood Jr., Billy Boy Arnold, Morris Pejoe, the Rolling Stones, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. He has more than 58 albums to his credit, including recordings for Chess Records. He is credited as helping to create the distinctive sound of the Chicago blues piano. In 2017, Gray was inducted in to the Blues Hall of Fame. Early life and education Shortly after he was born, Gray, an only child, moved with his parents to a farm in Alsen, Louisiana, a few miles north of Baton Rouge, where he lived during his childhood. He began studying the piano at the age of eight, taking lessons from a neighborhood woman, Mrs. White. Gray also credits the radio and music records in his home for inspiring his love of music at an early age. A few years later, he began playing piano and organ at the local Baptist church, and his family eventually acquired a piano for the house. Playing the blues was not encouraged in his family, but Henry played blues at Mrs. White's house, and by the time he was 16 he was playing blues at a club in Alsen. His father initially disapproved of the job but became supportive after seeing how much money his son was making. In 1943, during World War II, Gray joined the United States Army and was sent to the South Pacific. While in the Army, he would frequently entertain other soldiers by playing the piano and singing. Shortly before the war was over, Gray was given a medical discharge from the army. He returned to the United States in 1946 and spent a brief time in Alsen before relocating to Chicago, where he had relatives, including a new baby sister, Annette, born in 1951. Career=Chicago: 1946‚Äì1968 After arriving in Chicago, Gray began spending a great deal of his time in the growing postwar jazz and blues club scene. He would spend hours listening to and trying to learn from the city's best piano players and would occasionally get hired for smaller gigs. One day while he was sitting in at a club, he caught the attention of Big Maceo Merriweather, an important jazz and blues piano player in Chicago (from Detroit). Merriweather befriended Gray and had an important influence on Gray's \\"two- fisted playing\\". He also introduced Gray to several notable bands and club owners. As a result, Gray obtained steady gigs with groups like Little Hudson's Red Devil Trio (Hudson Showers) and the guitarist Morris Pejoe before moving into extensive work as a session musician in the recording studio accompanying Jimmy Reed, Bo Diddley, Billy Boy Arnold, Pejoe, and others. His first recording session was in 1952 with Jimmy Rogers. Gray also worked occasionally with Little Walter, who nicknamed the young pianist \\"Bird Breast\\". In 1956, Gray joined Howlin' Wolf's band and was Wolf's main piano player for twelve years in performance and on recordings. Also during this time, Gray became a session player for numerous artists on recordings made by Chess Records. He recorded with many leading figures of the blues, including Abb Lock, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Homesick James, Robert Lockwood, Jr., Billy Boy Arnold, Muddy Waters, Johnny Shines, Hubert Sumlin, Lazy Lester, Little Walter Jacobs, Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, James Cotton, Little Milton Campbell, Jimmy Rogers, Jimmy Reed, and Koko Taylor. Gray also made some recordings on other labels during the 1950s and 1960s, including several with J. D. \\"Jay\\" Miller's Louisiana Excello blues band. In 1963, Gray performed with Elmore James on the night that James died of a heart attack.. Louisiana: 1968‚Äì2019 Gray left Wolf's band in 1968 and returned to Alsen, Louisiana, due to the death of his father and to assist his mother with the family business, a fish market. Gray became an important part of Louisiana's music scene. His big, rollicking sound became part of the region's \\"swamp blues\\" style. In addition to performing, Gray worked with the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board as a roofer from 1968 to 1983. In the mid-1980s he recorded a series of singles for the Sunland label, some with the harmonica player Whispering Smith, which are amongst the last great traditional blues 45-rpm records. From the mid-1980s to 2019 Gray performed at virtually all of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festivals, three Chicago Blues Festivals (1987, 1989, and 2005), the Montreal Jazz Festival (1988), nearly every Baton Rouge Blues Festival since its inception, the San Francisco Blues Festival, Memphis's W.C. Handy Blues Festival, several times at Festival International (Lafayette, Louisiana), the Mississippi Valley Blues Festival (Davenport, Iowa), the King Biscuit Blues Festival (Helena, Arkansas), and many other festivals around the United States. Gray traveled to Europe frequently to play at festivals and in concerts and can be heard on several European releases. In 1988, Blind Pig Records released Gray's first stateside feature LP, Lucky Man. The album was produced by the guitarist Steve Freund, who also joined Gray on the album for a combination of both Chicago blues and bayou boogie. In 1990, Gray recorded the album Louisiana Swamp Blues for Wolf Records. In 1998 he played for Mick Jagger's 55th birthday celebration in Paris. In the summer of 1999, Gray toured Europe with Marva Wright and her band, giving concerts of \\"Louisiana music\\" under the sponsorship of Blue House Records. In 2001, Gray recorded two albums: Watch Yourself, for the Lucky Cat label, and Henry Gray Plays Chicago Blues, for Hightone Records. In 2003, Henry Gray & the Cats released a CD and DVD entitled Henry Gray & the Cats: Live in Paris. Also in 2003, Gray was featured along with Ray Charles, Dr. John, Pinetop Perkins and Dave Brubeck in Clint Eastwood's film Blues Piano, a part of Martin Scorsese's seven-part series The Blues, which was aired on public television in the United States. In 2006, Gray was featured along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Pinetop Perkins, Marcia Ball and Little Red in a concert at Morgan Freeman's club Ground Zero in Clarksdale, Mississippi, which was recorded for the DVD Falsifyin', produced and released by SunLion Films. That same year, Gray starred in the independent film The Glass Chord as Saul Solomon, an aging musician with Alzheimer's disease. Gray also continued to tour as a soloist and with his band Henry Gray and the Cats. He appeared in the 2015 documentary film I Am the Blues.\\"Here Are 6 Must-See Music Films at Hot Docs\\". Exclaim!, April 19, 2016. In June 2017, Gray went into Dockside Studio with his great grandson DeAndre Tate and The Creole Cats band (Paul \\"Lil' Buck\\" Sinegal, Danny Williams, Stan Chambers, and Oreun Joubert) to record 92, aptly titled after his age. 92 was produced by Terrance Simien, Cynthia Simien, and Tate, and was engineered by Justin Tocket and mixed/mastered by DF Audio (David Farrell). Personal life Gray suffered from alcoholism but was sober for many years during his later life. In 1989, his home in the Baton Rouge area was destroyed by a tornado. He was married to Rivers Gray. Together they had three children and eight grandchildren. Following surgery for a collapsed lung, Gray experienced a mild heart attack on February 20, 2017, at age 92. Despite this double health scare, Henry Gray continued playing the blues. On October 10, 2019, it was confirmed by Gray's family that he had entered hospice care in Baton Rouge. Gray died at the age of 95 on February 17, 2020.

It was the last coaster Custom Coasters International (CCI) finished (they had also started work on New Mexico Rattler at Cliff's Amusement Park but went bankrupt before they could finish it). The ride is unusual as it has an elevator to raise the cars to the top of the track as opposed to the more traditional lift-hill. CCI constructed new cage-enclosed cars due to the proximity between riders and the themed 'mountain' sections of the ride. Eight people may ride in a two-car train simultaneously. Two face forward and two backward, opposite each other in each car. The ride enters an enclosed 'mountain' area several times throughout the ride. The imitation mountain was originally used for a previous dark ride. This dark ride went through the mountain and lights would illuminate scenes of various animals in the mountain. The Lost Coaster is a moderate ride and does not have big drops. Part of the thrill is the alarming shake generated by the unusual track design. The ride itself has been open since the mid-1980s as a mine like car ride with no hills or wooden tracks. The original ride's opening was delayed for a long time before officially opening in the 1980s. Lost Coaster operates a single, eight passenger train, which can result in some unnecessarily long waiting times. The Lost Coaster is also known for getting stuck quite often due to design flaws in the track. The train requires more weight in the front car to trigger sensors in the ‚ÄúDynamite Willie‚Äù section of the ride, otherwise the car will get stuck in the break run. The Gravity Group, which is run by the former CCI designers, stated that Lost Coaster was the inspiration for the design of Twister at Gr√∂na Lund in Sweden.

It is a mixture of lively retail shopping areas, with local stores, bars or 'drinking spots', bus/taxi stations, and a market. It also has many hotels, guest houses and rental apartments- such as the eco-chic Legassi Gardens Apartments-, and 'high-end' developing residential estates, such as Ofankor Hills Estates and Franko Estates, amongst many others; as well as the long- established executive gated community of ACP Estates.; and HFS Estates which borders the erstwhile Gua Koo Sacred Grove in Pokuase. Pokuase Junction is one of the busy bus stops for public transport, including buses (trotros) and shared-taxis, along the Accra-Kumasi motorway. The large bus station just at Pokuase Junction provides frequent transport to all sides of Accra, and transport runs as far as Medina, Tema and Spintex Road. Accra is the 11th- largest metropolitan area in Africa. Pokuase will soon be linked, by the completion in October 2020 of the 4-tier Pokuase Interchange, to Kwabenya, and Ritz Junction; and will be more accessible for Academic City University, Webster University Ghana Campus, The University of Ghana Legon, Ajiringano and East Legon, which will then be a short drive away. There are also a number of schools in the area, including The Hill Top Academy, Disciplined Child School, and The Spelmore Institute on College Lane- just off the Pokuase Interchange. The Spelmore Institute is an international school for children aged 5-16, teaching the British Curriculum and preparing students for International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) examinations. The American founded NGO The Women's Trust has its head offices in Pokuase Town, as does the Ghanaian/American NGO Ghana Sustainable Aid Project. The Village of Hope Orphanage and Vocational Training college are also located off Pokuase Junction at Ayawaso. History Okai Kwei Hill leads down to Ayawaso, the traditional homeland of the Ga people, the historical custodians of the land of the capital city of Accra. Okai Kwei Hill was named after the last Ga King to rule that region. Okai Kwei was reputedly an astute statesman, as seen by his relationship with the Europeans and his African neighbours. But he finally fell from power in 1680. Okai Kwei had many wives, courtiers and musicians at his court, and lived an opulent life. At the Greater Accra Region Homowo Festival in Ayawaso there is still cultural dancing and displays, the regalia of durbars honoring the Ga chiefs, and traditional worship at the Ga sacred shrines around Okai Kwei Hill. Transport links There is a train station on the hill-side at Pokuase Junction, and Pokuase is one of the stops from the line starting at Nsawam and heading into central Accra. Pokuase is also found at a central point in a multi-sided star of roads leading to different parts of central Accra, and other major towns. From Pokuase you can drive or take local transport: -To central Accra, along the Accra-Kumasi motorway, passing Achimota and Kwame Nkrumah Circle -To Kumasi, along the Accra to Kumasi Motorway -To Mallam, along the Awoshie-Pokuase dual-carriageway, a section of the ECOWAS Highway, and onto Cape Coast. President John Evans Atta MillsPresident Professor John Evans Atta Mills cut the sod on 22 March 2012 for work on this road to begin, and has been substantially completed to join the Pokuase/Ayawaso road leading to Pokuase Junction. The road was designed to have service lanes, walkways and bicycle lanes. It is funded by the African Development Bank,African Development Bank French Development Agency and Government of Ghana. *To Madina, East Legon, Legon University, the Airport and Central Accra taking the Kwabenya Kwabenya road, then turning right. Kwabenya Road will become a continuation of the ECOWAS Highway, once the flyover at ACP Junction has been completed. *To Aburi, also taking the Kwabenya Road and turning left at Kwabenya *To Lapaz, then to the Tetteh Quashie Interchange, and to Central Accra The Accra‚ÄìKumasi motorway is one of the major arterial roads in Ghana, going from Accra to beyond Kumasi and on to the Northern areas of Ghana, then to Burkina Faso. The stretch of this road from Nsawam to Ofankor, passing Pokuase, is a 4-lane dual carriageway; then from Ofankor to Achimota, it is an 8-lane motorway, with 4 'express' centre lanes, and 4 'local access' lanes. The road from Ofankor also has 9 feet wide pavements for pedestrian shopping. The completion of this motorway has brought new housing estates and 'gated community' developments to the area, as well as shopping complexes, which are under construction along the route. The ECOWAS Highway The Ghana section of this major motorway, linking west Africa, is now underway, with the construction of a 200 feet, multi-lane highway passing through Pokuase, along Okai Kwei hill, and across the Accra‚ÄìKumasi motorway, on through Kwabenya-Madina-East Legon, and joining Tema. Surrounding areas The 'local' shopping mall is at St Johns,the Achimota Retail Park, with many international stores including Shoprite, Palace, and Mr P; amongst many international eating places, including KFC, pizza parlours,ice-cream parlours, coffee shops and more. There are places of historical and cultural interest, telling the personal history of communities in Accra, all around Pokuase: * The Reverend John Teye Memorial School, close to Pokuase, is the most established music academy in Ghana, and boast many famous Ghanaians as alumni, including John Quansah,Dj Lalo,Senanu Gbedawu, and Jimmy Quist, presenter at Citi FM. * St John's Grammar School, at St John's located between Pokuase and Achimota * Nsawam Medium Security Prison * Blue Skies fruit farm and juice bar * Achimota, which is along the motorway going into central Accra. In Achimota there is perhaps the largest completed bus station in Ghana, with transport going to all over the country. Achimota also has a golf club, which was founded by the Scots and English teachers who came to the then 'Gold Coast' in last century to establish and teach in one of the earliest and most prestigious schools in Ghana, ‚ÄòAchimota School‚Äô. There is also the Forest Reserve and housing a small Zoo. * The historic town of Nsawam is famous for being the administrative centre of commercial cocoa production in colonial Ghana. It once hosted the Prince of Wales, on his visit to Ghana, and has many historic buildings (though needing renovation), and the bustling Nsawam market. * Aburi is yet another town with a colonial history and is the location of 'Aburi Gardens', a beautiful botanical paradise created during the colonial era, with contributions from the Caribbean (particularly Jamaican) missionaries who came to Ghana in the mid-1800s to bring Christianity. In fact, in the Aburi region can be found a number of churches and even wells built by this missionary community, and one area is actually still called ‚ÄòJamaica‚Äô! Aburi also has the popular road-side wood carvers market, where you can find many bargains; and Rita Marley lives here, the widow of legend Bob Marley and one of the I-Threes. She has a recording studio and is patron of several community development projects. * Amasaman is the administrative capital of the Ga South Municipal area of Greater Accra, and one of the districts capitals of Ghana. The Ga South district is one of the new districts and municipalities created in 2008 by the then President, John Agyekum John Kufuor, and was inaugurated on 29 February 2008. * Myeera, found just off Pokuase, is the location of one of the many infamous slave markets in Ghana, where human beings were once sold.

He is known only from his writings and those of others. Johan Basset dedicated his Letovari to him, whom he called a friend from temps passat (\\"times passed\\").  Biography  Massanet debated in a partimen with the lawyer Gabriel Ferru√ß whether it was preferable to resolve conflicts militarily or judicially. Unsurprisingly, Ferru√ß the lawyer argued the latter while Massanet, probably of the knightly class, defended the private war. The poem runs eighty-eight lines, with the incipit Amichs Garaus, en cuy fis prets s'agen√ßa. The debaters present the historian with many interesting allusions to contemporary events, but failing to resolve their dilemma they instead asked two others to judge their debate. Massanet nominated Johan d'Olivella, but had recently been named veguer of T√†rrega and could not. Ferru√ß' nominee, Jacme Ripoll, another lawyer, found in favour of the judicial resolution. Massanet also wrote an dansa the begins Amors joy mi renovelha. Each verse ends with the refrain mirant la flor de l'ametlha (or amenlha, \\"watching the flower of the almond tree\\"). This poem is praised both by Mart√≠ de Riquer i Morera and Josep Romeu i Figueras for its beauty, delicacy, and originality.

The film is directed by George Cukor and produced by Charles Brackett. At the 24th Academy Awards, it received a nomination in the category of Best Costume Design (Black & White) for Charles LeMaire and Reni√©. The award, however, went to Edith Head for her work in A Place in the Sun. Plot Through her \\"Contacts and Contracts\\" company, Mae Swasey is busy scheming to bring couples together. It is not very rewarding financially, and Mae is in debt. Even one of her seeming successes, Ina Kuschner's impending wedding to Radiographer Matt Hornbeck, does not go as hoped. Ina's mother refuses to pay Mae the agreed-upon $500 commission. Mae, however, gets the last laugh; Matt gets cold feet at the last moment and leaves the bride waiting at the altar. When Mae goes to see another client, her purse is accidentally taken by model Kitty Bennett, while she gets Kitty's lookalike one. Looking inside for something to identify its owner, Mae reads a letter in which Kitty's current boyfriend apologizes for not mentioning that he is married (but wants to keep on seeing her). When the two women get together to exchange purses, Kitty becomes annoyed when she discovers Mae has read her letter and rejects Mae's advice to give the self-admitted \\"heel\\" up. Kitty comes to apologize for her unkind words later. Mae talks her into breaking up with the married man, then tries to fix her up with Matt by pretending that Kitty may have swallowed a missing earring (which may have fallen into an omelet Mae was preparing) and requires an X-ray. Mae's own sister Emmy shows up. Twenty years before, she had stolen Mae's husband. Now that she is recently widowed and lonely, she wants Mae to find her a replacement. Mae turns her down. Matt and Kitty become a couple, but when Kitty learns about Mae's meddling and her plans to maneuver a commitment- averse Matt into proposing, she ends their friendship. Mae goes away to a resort to think things over. When Kitty goes to make up with Mae at her office, she runs into Mr. Johannson, one of Mae's clients, who needs help desperately to patch up his relationship. Kitty reluctantly takes the absent Mae's place. Then Mae's friend Doberman explains how badly she hurt Mae, that Mae thought of her as the daughter she never had, and that Mae helps those who are shy, need a helpful push, or are not as pretty as Kitty. Afterward, Kitty tries to arrange a relationship for Mae with Dan Chancellor, a wealthy Canadian bachelor who had heard of Mae's service. Mae and Kitty become friends again, but Mae comes to realize she herself will never be lonely as long as she has people to help. She decides that Dan would actually be a better match for Emmy. In addition, Matt realizes he wants to marry Kitty after all, and gets her to agree to it. Finally, Doberman surprises Mae by presenting himself as her suitor.

[Fox production head Daryl] Zanuck loved the picture so much that I don't think he eliminated one frame. I don't remember one marginal note in a script of 140 pages. We came in on budget, and Cukor's work was lovely, sensitive. We had a big success, and the reason The Model and the Marriage Broker didn't score an even bigger success was because it came just at the start of the age of CinemaScope and color, and that story certainly did not lend itself to CinemaScope and color. It was very intimate... But when it was finished... Zanuck was so involved in CinemaScope and had put so much money and publicity into CinemaScope that he simply treated this picture as a stepchild.\\" References External links   Category:1951 films Category:1951 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by George Cukor Category:Films produced by Charles Brackett Category:Films scored by Cyril J.

Its mission is to rekindle an ethic of civic responsibility in America through universal national service. ServiceNation's goal was to expand opportunities for Americans to spend a year in non-military national service such as AmeriCorps. National service programs like Americorps pay a living stipend and reward volunteers who have completed service with a monetary education award. In January 2016, ServiceNation merged with the Franklin Project at the Aspen Institute and the Service Year Exchange (which was incubated at the National Conference on Citizenship) to form Service Year Alliance. History ServiceNation was founded as a campaign of Be The Change, Inc. Be The Change creates national issue-based campaigns that work to solve society's greatest challenges and change the world. It has two main campaigns: ServiceNation and Opportunity Nation. Both are driven by broad cross-partisan coalitions that inspire culture change and accelerate public policy development to bring about positive changes in our society. Serve A Year Campaign On March 23, 2015, in front of a crowd of 200 Hollywood executives, writers and producers, Chelsea Clinton and Jimmy Kimmel teamed up with ServiceNation to unveil an ambitious initiative aimed at convincing the youth of America to spend a year after high school or college serving in their communities through programs like AmeriCorps, a domestic version of the Peace Corps. Following the announcement of the \\"Serve a Year\\" campaign at the Jimmy Kimmel Live studio lot in Los Angeles, Clinton taped a segment for Kimmel's show that aired later that evening during Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The \\"Serve a Year\\" campaign is based on a similar initiative in which the Harvard School of Public Health worked with Hollywood writers to insert drunk driving messages ‚Äî along with the term \\"Designated Driver\\" ‚Äî into hit TV shows. With more than 160 primetime programs incorporating the concept into their content over a four-year period, the country saw a 30 percent decline in drunk driving fatalities between 1988 and 1994.http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chelsea-clinton-calls-hollywood- promote-783593 ServiceNation Summit In 2008, Be The Change, Inc. partnered with Points of Light Institute, Civic Enterprises, and City Year to host a bipartisan summit on national service and civic engagement and was underwritten by AARP, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Target Corporation, and Time magazine. ServiceNation was launched at the summit, called the ServiceNation Presidential Candidates Forum and Summit, held on September 11‚Äì12, 2008 at Columbia University in New York City. The Summit honored and featured the coalition of more than 300 organizations who support the vision of expanding national service opportunities. Notable attendees included: New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, then-California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, then-Senator Hillary Clinton, Martin Luther King III, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Queen Noor of Jordan, Caroline Kennedy, Wendy Kopp, Admiral Mike Mullen, then-Florida Governor Charlie Crist, and many others. The main event was a forum attended by both 2008 presidential candidates, Senator John McCain and then-Senator Barack Obama, moderated by Richard Stengel, managing editor of Time magazine, with PBS NewsHour anchor Judy Woodruff. New York's governor at the time, David Paterson, welcomed the audience. The forum showcased both candidates‚Äô views on national service and civic engagement. McCain highlighted the public-private partnerships such as Teach For America that have been successful while Obama emphasized the importance of young people being part of something larger than themselves. At the Summit, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Caroline Kennedy, speaking on behalf of her uncle, Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) proposed legislation for expanding national service in America. Co-sponsored by Senators Hatch and Kennedy, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act passed within the first 100 days of President Barack Obama's first term on April 21, 2009. ServiceNation was a strong advocate for the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which sanctions a significant increase in federal funding for nationwide service programs such as AmeriCorps. This legislation was passed with bipartisan support by the Senate and House on March 30, 2009. It expanded national service, pledging to increase the number of AmeriCorps members to 250,000 by 2017, among other provisions. ServiceNation played a leading role in drafting and advocating for the passage of this legislation. At the summit, Senator Chris Dodd also unveiled two bills to promote community service among high school students and seniors. After the summit, ServiceNation planned a Day of Action for September 27 in which organizers across the nation planned more than 2,300 activities. The Day of Action focused on people signing a Declaration of Service pledging to complete 50 hours of service in the next year. Civilian military initiative On Veteran's Day, November 11, 2009, ServiceNation launched a civilian-military initiative called Mission Serve to connect civilian and military communities through shared service and volunteerism. The Veteran's Day event was kicked off with First Lady Michelle Obama, Dr. Jill Biden, and Mrs. Alma Powell. Mission Serve launched with 36 newly formed civilian-military partnerships. From 2009 to 2011, Mission Serve organized annual service events across the country on Veteran's Day that united civilian and military communities through service projects. In 2011, notable participants included General Stanley A. McChrystal, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Yankees manager Joe Girardi, the cast of Hawaii Five-0, Brandon Routh, Megan Fox, Laird Hamilton, Gabby Reece, and many others. The centerpiece of the day was veterans and military families working with civilians to help other veterans in order to empower veterans. In 2011, Be the Change and ServiceNation convened major Hollywood studios, networks, talent agencies, and guilds in the entertainment industry for a yearlong discussion of veteran's issues. The result was the industry signing on to an awareness and activation campaign called Got Your 6 to change the conversation about veterans and military families. The Mission Serve initiative evolved into this campaign and became Got Your 6. Merger In early 2012, ServeNext, a nonprofit launched in 2007 to advocate for national service programs like AmeriCorps through grassroots advocacy joined the umbrella of ServiceNation initiatives. Leadership Zach Maurin - Executive Director of ServiceNation Alan Khazei - CEO of Be The Change, Inc. Rob Gordon - President of Be The Change, Inc. Current priorities As of April 2013, ServiceNation is pursuing several priorities: expanding national service, amending the GI Bill, and increasing awareness about national service in America. In partnership with its sister campaign, Got Your 6, ServiceNation works to promote expansion of opportunities for veterans to continue to serve the nation. More than one million military service members will return to civilian life in the next five years and most are eligible for GI Bill benefits. However, only 36% use their benefits. Introducing the option of using part of GI Bill benefits to spend a year in service to the country will provide transition time as well as pathway to education and jobs. ServiceNation also pursues expanding national service opportunities through grassroots advocacy. Full-time field organizers and volunteer district captains engage key supporters in targeted local areas to build support for national service. These organizers and District Captains work with elected officials, the media, key decision makers, nonprofit partners, AmeriCorps Alums, and others to help educate about the value of national service. ServiceNation Coalition Since 2008, the ServiceNation Coalition has united organizations across the country who support universal national service and commit to using grassroots action to let elected officials and the nation's leaders know. More than 300 organizations are currently part of the coalition including national organizations and local affiliates.

She served on the Greenland Patrol during World War II and after the war on the Great Lakes. From 1980 until decommissioning she was homeported at Governors Island. Construction Raritan was built for the Coast Guard by Defoe Boat Works, Bay City, Michigan, at a cost of 309,000 and was launched alongside her sister cutter on 23 March 1939, the first dual launching to ever take place in Bay City. She was one of four Arundel-type 110 foot light icebreaking tugs built in 1939, the design of which was taken from the successful 1934 Calumet-type 110 foot tug design.Scheina (1982), p 74 Raritan was capable of breaking ice up to thick. After commissioning on 11 April 1939, she was assigned harbor duties at Boston, Massachusetts. History=World War II Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940 and then laid claim to Denmark's crown colony, Greenland. The U.S. State Department immediately began negotiations with Henrik Kauffmann, the Danish government-in-exile representative in Washington, D.C. and Eske Brun, the Governor of Greenland to preserve Greenland's sovereignty. An agreement was reached on 3 May where Greenland requested U.S. protection. Because of the Coast Guard's experience with the International Ice Patrol and because it operated the only ships that were equipped to handle ice conditions in Greenland waters, the State Department requested Coast Guard assistance in enforcing claims of sovereignty and to prevent Germany from taking control of the cryolite mines at Ivittuut and establishing weather stations on the Eastern coastline. In August, Raritan along with the cutters , , and joined Ice Patrol cutters and as the first cutters assigned to the Greenland Patrol.Walling, p 6 Raritan was transferred to U.S. Navy control on 1 November 1941 by Executive Order 8929 which transferred the entire Coast Guard from the United States Department of the Treasury to the United States Navy. Raritan continued to be homeported at Boston under U.S. Navy control but was manned by Coast Guard personnel. Post-war service After the Coast Guard was returned to the Treasury Department on 1 January 1946 in accordance with Executive Order 9666, Raritan continued to operate in Boston Harbor. She subsequently was transferred to Portsmouth, Virginia. and in 1962 she was assigned to the Great Lakes. Raritan was decommissioned from Coast Guard service on 14 May 1988.

Kelco Disposal, 492 U.S. 257 (1989), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable fines does not apply to punitive- damage awards in civil cases when the United States is not a party.  Prior history  Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI) had been the dominant provider of roll-off trash collection services in the Burlington, Vermont market since it entered the roll-off market in 1976. Joseph Kelley was a district manager for BFI until 1980, when he left to found his own company, Kelco Disposal. By 1982, Kelco had garnered over 40% of the roll-off market; in that year, BFI began a campaign of predatory pricing, which continued for several months, with the intent of driving Kelco out of the business. In 1985, BFI sold their Burlington operations to another company. In 1984, Kelco filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont alleging that BFI had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. Kelco also claimed, as an alternative state-law cause of action, that BFI interfered with its contracts with its customers. In the subsequent jury trial, BFI was found liable on both claims. In a separate one-day trial on the damages, the jury settled on compensatory damages of $51,146, and punitive damages of $6 million. The trial court then awarded Kelco treble damages and attorney's fees on the anti-trust claim, but awarded $6,066,082.74 on the alternative state tort claim, so further action proceeded on the basis of the higher award. BFI appealed the judgment to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and raised the issue of the excessive fines clause. The Second Circuit affirmed the trial court's decision on both liability and damages, finding for the sake of argument that the jury's punitive-damage award was not excessive whether or not the Eighth Amendment applied to this case. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider the specific question of whether the excessive fines clause applies to civil cases involving purely private parties.Opinion of the court, 492 U.S. 257, 260ff.

These negotiations followed the 2008 presidential election, in which Mugabe was controversially re-elected, as well as the 2008 parliamentary election, in which the MDC won a majority in the House of Assembly. Preliminary talks to set up conditions for official negotiations began between leading negotiators from both parties on 10 July, and on 22 July, the three party leaders met for the first time in Harare to express their support for a negotiated settlement of disputes arising out of the presidential and parliamentary elections. Negotiations between the parties officially began on 25 July in Pretoria, mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki. A final deal was reached on 11 September 2008, providing for Mugabe to remain President while Tsvangirai would become Prime Minister. The deal was signed on 15 September. Details of the talks=Preliminary negotiations Mbeki met with Mugabe on 5 July; Arthur Mutambara, Welshman Ncube, and Priscilla Misihairabwi-Mushonga of the MDC- Mutambara group also participated in the discussions. Although Tsvangirai's MDC organisation was not invited to participate, it declined to do so, reiterating its refusal to recognise Mugabe as president and saying that discussions should take place only in the presence of an AU-appointed mediator. Mbeki nevertheless expressed hopes that Tsvangirai's party would participate. Patrick Chinamasa stressed that the government was committed to dialogue with both MDC groupings, but said that Tsvangirai had committed \\"an act of utter disrespect\\" by failing to appear at the talks. Mutambara also stated that the involvement of all parties was necessary.\\"Mugabe meets opposition faction\\", Al Jazeera, 5 July 2008. Talks between the parties began in Pretoria on 10 July. ZANU-PF and both MDC groupings were present for the talks, although Tsvangirai said that his group's delegation, led by Biti, was present to explain its conditions for negotiations‚Äîwhich included an end to the violence, the release of MDC prisoners, and the appointment of an AU envoy‚Äî not to actually participate in negotiations.Nelson Banya, \\"Zimbabwe opposition denies negotiations started\\", Reuters.

In a report from the Human Sciences Research Council, a policy group in South Africa, that was released on 10 July, Peter Kagwanja wrote that violence perpetrated against ZANU-PF by MDC supporters, which he described as having previously been spontaneous, was becoming more organised, and he warned that this increased the possibility of a civil war. Chamisa, however, denied that the MDC had been responsible for any violence.\\"Zimbabwe opposition, gov't talk in South Africa\\", Associated Press. International Herald Tribune, 10 July 2008. On 11 July, the MDC said that Gift Mutsvungunu, a party official, had been found dead near Harare on the previous day; his body was said to be burned and his eyes gouged out. The MDC suspected the security forces of responsibility for this killing, and the party said that its total number of dead during the violence had reached 113.\\"Fresh violence clouds early Zimbabwe talks\\", Reuters.

Charamba accused Tsvangirai of purposefully attempting to travel with invalid documents so that he could use the resulting incident for political gain. Meanwhile, it was announced that Ian Khama, the President of Botswana, would not attend the summit unless an agreement was reached in Zimbabwe. On 15 August, the day before the summit, Tsvangirai spoke to a gathering of Cabinet ministers from the SADC countries. In this speech, he acknowledged that the MDC and ZANU-PF remained divided on the question of how executive powers should be allocated in the national unity government. According to Tsvangirai, the sides had agreed on leaving Mugabe in office as president and establishing a new position of Prime Minister for himself. Tsvangirai explained that he wanted to have strong, executive powers: as Prime Minister, he \\"must chair the Cabinet and be responsible for the formulation, execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers\\", stressing that he could not succeed in the role if he was given \\"responsibility without authority\\". Mugabe, according to Tsvangirai's proposal, would be a head of state without veto power; he would remain commander-in-chief of the military, but would act in that capacity on Tsvangirai's advice.\\"Tsvangirai says he'd accept Zimbabwe premiership\\", Associated Press.

On 20 August, however, the MDC took a firmer stance, declaring the move to convene Parliament to be unacceptable, with Biti stating that it would \\"be a clear repudiation of the Memorandum of Understanding, and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of ZANU-PF's unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks.

He also referred to the need to balance the powers that would be held by the President and Prime Minister under a power-sharing arrangement, whereby both would possess both responsibility and authority.

He also said that the MDC was planning to write to Mbeki to protest Mugabe's alleged violations of the July preliminary agreement.

A column in The Herald on 20 September belittled the agreement, saying that Mugabe remained free to appoint a Cabinet of his choosing and was only required to consult with the Prime Minister; it also said that the agreement could \\"collapse any day\\". Aside from this, Tsvangirai expressed concern regarding the stark and bitter language in the column (which was generally believed to have been written by Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba, under the pen name Nathaniel Manheru), describing it as hateful. One passage in the column seemed to suggest violence, saying that an audit of land reform, as provided by the agreement, would \\"draw blood redder than the setting sun.\\" Although Tsvangirai emphasised that he did not think the column's writer was expressing Mugabe's views, he said that if the column reflected ZANU-PF's attitude, the agreement was already doomed. =Ouster of Mbeki from South African presidency= Only a few days after the agreement was signed, Mbeki was forced to resign as President of South Africa by his party, the African National Congress (ANC). This raised additional concerns about the future of the agreement; it was unclear if Mbeki would continue to act as mediator, and it was unclear if South Africa, under new leadership, would remain so heavily involved in resolving Zimbabwe's political situation. Jakaya Kikwete, the President of Tanzania and Chairman of the African Union, said on 24 September that \\"the South African government ... will continue to focus on the issue\\", while SADC spokesman Charles Mubita said that Mbeki would continue to act as mediator. According to Mubita, Mbeki was appointed as mediator \\"based on his knowledge, understanding and acumen of the situation\\" and did not necessarily need to be a sitting president to serve in that role. For his part, Mugabe was quoted in The Herald on 25 September as saying that Mbeki's removal as President of South Africa was \\"devastating\\" and \\"very disturbing\\", while also stating that it was \\"the action of the South African people\\" and that as a Zimbabwean he was in no position to judge.\\"Mugabe devasted by Mbeki's recall\\", Sapa-DPA.

Independent Online, 1 October 2008, page 5. ZANU-PF's Chinamasa, however, denied that there was any deadlock in negotiations and said that all parties were committed to reaching an agreement. He said that any disagreement that might exist was insufficient to warrant Mbeki's intervention and expressed confidence that the matter could be resolved without his help.\\"Mugabe and his men reject mediation proposal\\", The Star. Independent Online, 2 October 2008, page 3. =Further negotiations between party leaders= Mugabe, Tsvangirai, and Mutambara met in Harare on 4 October for talks on the distribution of portfolios, but could not reach an agreement; according to Charamba, Mugabe's spokesman, the negotiating teams would meet again to discuss the allocation of the portfolios of finance and home affairs. Spokesmen for the MDC-T and the MDC-M also acknowledged the failure to reach an agreement and said that negotiations would continue.\\"Zimbabwe opposition, Mugabe fail to reach agreement: officials\\", AFP, 4 October 2008. The MDC-T's Chamisa said on 5 October that all of the Cabinet portfolios were in question, not just two of them, as claimed by Charamba.\\"Zimbabwe factions resume Cabinet talks\\", Associated Press. International Herald Tribune, 5 October 2008. The negotiators met briefly on 7 October but again failed to reach an agreement. According to Chamisa, the parties were \\"still in different worlds in a fundamental way\\".\\"Still no deal on Zimbabwe govt: opposition\\", AFP, 7 October 2008. For his part, Biti said that he and fellow MDC negotiator Elton Mangoma left the meeting in outrage after the ZANU-PF negotiators said that they were only present \\"to justify why they needed the two ministries of home affairs and finance\\". Biti insisted that the MDC had never agreed to the allocation of any ministries and that it was deceptive for ZANU-PF to claim that there were only two in dispute. He expressed hope that Mbeki could help resolve the situation, saying that if Mbeki was unsuccessful the only remaining hope was divine intervention. It was reported at this time that the power-sharing agreement was near collapse; reportedly, some members of the ZANU-PF leadership were adamant that the party needed to hold the key portfolios, believing that ZANU-PF would be in grave danger if it did not control those ministries.Stanley Gama, \\"Zimbabwe power-sharing close to collapse\\", The Mercury. Independent Online, 8 October 2008, page 4. ANC President Jacob Zuma said on the same day that he hoped the Zimbabwean parties could reach an agreement on their own, but he also said that Mbeki was available to facilitate the negotiations if necessary.\\"Zuma urges more Zimbabwe talks to end deadlock\\", AFP, 7 October 2008. Tsvangirai said on 9 October that the talks were deadlocked and progress was impossible unless Mbeki intervened. Meanwhile, Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu dismissed the claim of a deadlock entirely: \\"Deadlock is the figment of imagination by our detractors from outside Zimbabwe\\". According to Ndlovu, it was necessary for ZANU-PF to \\"teach art of government formation and implementation of policies\\" to the MDC, as they were \\"still new\\".\\"Zimbabwe inflation soars; power-sharing talks deadlocked\\", AFP, 9 October 2008. Nevertheless, Mugabe, Tsvangirai, and Mutambara met on 10 October and agreed that Mbeki's mediation was needed.\\"Mugabe to retain control of army and police\\", AFP, 11 October 2008. =Announcement of cabinet= On 11 October, The Herald published an official list showing the allocation of ministries to the three parties; defence, home affairs, foreign affairs, justice, and local government were among the 14 portfolios allotted to ZANU-PF. The MDC-T's 13 portfolios included constitutional and parliamentary affairs, economic planning and investment promotion, labour and social welfare, sport, arts and culture, and science and technology development, while the MDC-M's three portfolios were listed as education, regional integration and international co-operation, and industry and commerce. According to The Herald, only the finance ministry remained in dispute, and it said that Mbeki would travel to Zimbabwe to assist in negotiations on the matter. The allocations published in The Herald were not approved by the MDC-T, which rejected them outright. MDC-T spokesman Chamisa denounced the publication of the list as \\"unilateral, contemptuous and outrageous\\", saying that such imbalance in the importance of the portfolios would effectively give ZANU-PF control of the government. He warned that ZANU- PF's \\"arrogance\\" would \\"put the deal into jeopardy\\". At a rally in Harare on 12 October, Tsvangirai said that the MDC-T would withdraw from the agreement if ZANU-PF did not relent on the allocation of ministries. MDC-M spokesman Edwin Mushoriwa also rejected the list of allocated ministries, saying that it was a \\"hallucination on the part of ZANU-PF.\\"\\"Zimbabwe power-sharing deal on the rocks\\", AFP, 12 October 2008. An official close to the presidency said the dilution of Mugabe's powers promised in the agreement was \\"illusory\\", and described the MDC as merely a \\"junior partner\\" whose only role would be \\"to gain legitimacy and international funds\\". ZANU-PF planned to take the ministries of defence, justice, home affairs, farming, information, and mines. The mining sector is the last occasionally functioning part of the economy given the country's wealth of natural resources and this carries huge opportunities for corruption. The MDC would be offered the finance ministry, in an effort to persuade donors that real reform was taking place so that would trigger billions in aid and reconstruction. The presidential official said \\"It's a tricky situation for the MDC...Nonetheless we now have the opposition in government and they have to fix the economy, just as they told the electorate.\\" A ministerial post involving kick starting foreign aid is seen by some as a poison chalice for the MDC. If the party were to succeed it would help shore up support for the ZANU-PF and make it harder to oust in the future, while a failure would cause the MDC to be branded as incompetent and would undermine its own support. MDC officials were said to be aware of the risk of being manipulated and refused to sign up for a ministry that lacks real authority. According to an MDC spokesman, \\"It would appear that Zanu-PF does not understand power-sharing. We are still poles apart, with them insisting on taking all the key ministries, literally rendering the (opposition) peripheral in government ‚Äì in fact, a situation where we would be in but out of government.\\" Msika and Joice Mujuru were sworn in as Vice- Presidents by Mugabe on 13 October. Justice Minister Chinamasa said that this represented another step in the process and that it would be followed by the swearing in of the Prime Minister and the new Cabinet, remarking that \\"the locomotive has been too long at the railway station and it is now warming up its engine towards delivering services to the people\\". According to Chinamasa, parliamentary approval of the constitutional amendments was not necessary prior to the appointment of the Prime Minister; he said that the amendments would enable Tsvangirai and Mutambara to take up seats in Parliament, and that having seats in Parliament would merely provide them with constitutional legitimacy after they assumed office as ministers. In other comments, Chinamasa blamed the MDC for stalling the situation and complained that it was trying to renew discussion on matters that had been previously settled.\\"Zimbabwe President Mugabe swears in vice presidents\\", Xinhua. People's Daily, 14 October 2008. =Return of Mbeki and failure of negotiations= Later on 13 October, Mbeki arrived in Zimbabwe to facilitate negotiations.\\"Mbeki visits Zimbabwe in bid to save fragile power-sharing deal\\", AFP, 13 October 2008. Mugabe and Tsvangirai met for over seven hours on 14 October, but no agreement was reached.\\"Mbeki brings Zimbabwe rivals into fresh power-sharing talks\\", AFP, 15 October 2008. Talks over the next two days did not produce an agreement, but on 16 October Mugabe expressed optimism about the possibility of an agreement being reached on the next day, stressing the \\"need for compromise on both sides\\". Chamisa said that there was \\"some movement, but not enough\\". Reportedly control of the home affairs ministry remained a key sticking point; ZANU-PF was said to have offered the finance ministry to the MDC and to have proposed that the parties alternate control of the home affairs ministry, but the MDC reportedly rejected this proposal.\\"Zimbabwe power-sharing talks stalled\\", AFP, 16 October 2008. By 17 October, Tsvangirai announced to the press that the talks had failed due to the conflict over the home affairs ministry, and that both he and Mugabe had agreed to refer a resolution of differences to SADC; Mugabe stated that the talks \\"went in the wrong direction\\".Mugabe says power-sharing talks 'went in wrong direction', by IC Publications, 17 October 2008 On 16 October, SADC had officially acknowledged that it did not recognise Mugabe as the legitimately- elected president in response to a legal application filed against it by the Zimbabwe Exiles Forum,\\"SADC agrees Mugabe illegitimate but refuses to bar him from meetings\\" by SW Radio Africa, 16 October 2008 but it rejected a request from the Forum for the rejection of Mugabe from SADC meetings due to SADC's belief that Mbeki's role as moderator in the negotiations would facilitate an end to the deadlock and bring the power-sharing deal to fruition. SADC, according to Tsvangirai, would meet on 20 October in Swaziland to discuss further proceedings; in the meantime, neither party would walk away from talks.\\"Regional bloc to meet Monday on Zimbabwe\\", by Cris Chinaka, swissinfo, 17 October 2008 However, on 20 October, the scheduled meeting took place without Tsvangirai in attendance, due to a boycott called by the MDC after Tsvangirai was given a temporary one-way exit document by the Zimbabwean government that was only meant for travel to Swaziland; Swaziland is geographically landlocked by South Africa and Mozambique, and any travel to Swaziland would go through the air or groundspace of either country. The MDC took the lack of an official passport, which Tsvangirai had lacked for months prior to the scheduled talks, as a sign of the ZANU-PF's lack of consideration for the MDC or the talks, while the ZANU-PF regarded the matter as a technicality that was due to the government's lack of access to paper. The meeting, instead, brought Mugabe to discuss matters with the SADC troika of heads of state from Swaziland, Mozambique and Tanzania, also known as the \\"Organ on Politics, Defence and Security\\"; in addition, it was announced that the current South African president, Kgalema Motlanthe, would join the organ. Meanwhile, negotiations between the three parties were suspended for a week. A new meeting was scheduled to be held in Harare on 27 October. MDC-T spokesman Chamisa said on 24 October that Tsvangirai would attend that meeting.\\"Zimbabwe opposition leader agrees to attend summit\\", AFP, 24 October 2008.

Tsvangirai rejected this and criticised SADC for not confronting Mugabe. Returning from the summit on 10 November, Mugabe said that the new Cabinet would be appointed \\"as quickly as possible\\" and expressed his hope that the MDC would accept the SADC proposal, while Chinamasa said that the MDC had been invited to submit names for the Cabinet.\\"Zimbabwe to form new government: Mugabe\\", AFP, 10 November 2008. On 12 November, MDC-T spokesman Chamisa said that his party would not join the Cabinet until \\"outstanding issues such as the issue of governors, equity and allocation of key ministries\\" were resolved. Bright Matonga, the Deputy Minister of Information, was quoted by The Herald on the same day as saying that the MDC would \\"never hold this country to ransom\\" and that there was no reason why a Cabinet could not be formed without the MDC if necessary.\\"Zim opposition won't join Mugabe until issues resolved\\", AFP, 12 November 2008. On 24 November, Motlanthe, the President of South Africa, urged the parties to reach an agreement, warning that if they did not, \\"the situation will get worse and will implode or collapse altogether\\". Talks between ZANU-PF and the MDC restarted in South Africa on 25 November, again mediated by Mbeki. Mbeki described the negotiations as \\"the same as ever, forward and backwards, sideways and around ... the usual\\".\\"Zimbabwe cholera crisis worsens as political talks resume\\", AFP, 25 November 2008. Tsvangirai released a statement on 26 November calling on Mbeki to step down. According to Tsvangirai, Mbeki \\"does not appear to understand how desperate the problem in Zimbabwe is, and the solutions he proposes are too small\\"; he also accused Mbeki of supporting ZANU-PF and said that the MDC could not \\"continue negotiating under his facilitation\\".\\"Zimbabwe opposition says Mbeki should step down as mediator\\", AFP, 26 November 2008. Two days later, a letter from Mbeki sharply criticising Tsvangirai's position was published. In this letter, Mbeki urged Tsvangirai to \\"take responsibility for the future of Zimbabwe\\" instead of devoting himself to \\"being a militant critic of President Mugabe and ZANU-PF.\\" In response to Tsvangirai's accusation that the SADC leaders lacked the courage to confront Mugabe, Mbeki said that Tsvangirai had \\"describe[d] us in a manner that is most offensive in terms of African culture\\".

On 13 December, the draft constitutional amendment was published in the government gazette. According to Motlanthe, the amendment marked a \\"major step towards the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe\\", and he expressed his hope that Tsvangirai would be sworn in immediately; it was believed that Mugabe was empowered to swear in Tsvangirai as Prime Minister without waiting for parliamentary approval of the amendment. Chamisa stressed that the outstanding issues of cabinet portfolios and provincial governors still needed to be resolved, while Chinamasa echoed Mugabe's earlier warning that he would call a new election if power-sharing was not successful.\\"Mugabe's party raises threat of fresh Zimbabwe polls\\", AFP, 13 December 2008. On 19 December 2008, Mugabe claimed that the US was trying to get Southern African countries to oust him from power, but that his regional neighbours were \\"not brave enough\\". On 4 January, Mugabe fired 12 ministers and deputy ministers who had lost their seats in Parliament from the cabinet: * Chen Chimutengwende (Public and Interactive Affairs) * Rugare Gumbo (Agriculture) * Amos Midzi (Mines and Mining Development) * Opa Muchinguri (Women's Affairs and Community Development) * Samuel Mumbengegwi (Finance) * Munacho Mutezo (Water Resources and Infrastructure Development) * Sikhanyiso Ndlovu (Information and Publicity) * Michael Nyambuya (Energy and Power Development) * Sithembiso Nyoni (Small and Medium Enterprises) * David Chapfika (deputy minister for Agriculture) * Edwin Muguti (deputy minister for Health) * Kenneth Mutiwekuziva (deputy minister for Small and Medium Enterprises) On 15 January 2009, Mugabe announced that he would hold talks with Tsvangirai again within a week. On 18 January 2009, Mugabe issued an ultimatum, calling on Tsvangirai to join the unity government or \\"break from it\\", refusing to concede on any points of contention. After another SADC meeting on 26 January 2009, there were conflicting reports. The SADC and ZANU-PF claimed that it had been agreed that the Constitutional Amendment would be adopted on 5 February 2009 and the new government, including Tsvangirai, sworn in on 11 February 2009, while the MDC stated that there had been no agreement on key issues. However, on 29 January 2009 the MDC confirmed that it would join the inclusive government and that the MDC's national council would vote on the issue on 30 January 2009;http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/29/content_10734342.htm it approved the deal.

Aftermath In August 2013, following Tsvangrai's defeat in the 2013 Zimbabwean general election, Tsavngrai announced that he and his party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) would no longer work with Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party, arguing that the elections were rigged and the election results were fraudulent.Zimbabwe President Mugabe re-elected amid fraud claims This would likely mean that Tsvangrai will resign as the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, and the breakage of the power sharing deal.

The city of Samarra in central Iraq had fallen under the control of insurgents shortly after insurgents had seized control of Fallujah and Ramadi. In preparation for an offensive to retake Fallujah, on 1 October, 5,000 American and Iraqi troops assaulted Samarra and secured the city after three days of fighting.  Losing control  During the month of September, negotiations with local commanders produced a city council which was to govern the city. However, insurgents soon seized control and the agreement fell apart. The city government was infiltrated by insurgents and the city came under the control of the Iraqi insurgency. Fighters loyal to the insurgents, including but not particularly Abu Musab Zarqawi, roamed the streets, confiscating music cassette tapes, which were condemned as haram. Attacks on American and Iraqi forces in the vicinity of the city greatly increased.The fight for Samarra: full-spectrum operations in modern warfare - Military Review American commanders decided to re-take the city as a precursor to the upcoming battle to retake Fallujah.  Battle  A soldier in the turret of a Humvee fires a .50-caliber machine gun at the enemy in Samarra, Iraq, 1 October 2004. On the morning of 1 October, the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion seized the Golden Mosque inside the city, capturing 25 insurgents and uncovering weapons caches. The Golden Mosque is considered the third-holiest shrine in Shia Islam, and any damage to it would have aroused significant controversy. Other Iraqi troops secured the Great Mosque of Samarra, a valued historic and cultural site. That same day, Iraqi troops with 1-26th INF along with 1-14 INF secured the main bridge across the Tigris River. American forces encountered insurgents transporting and unloading weapons using speedboats and opened fire, destroying the boats. American and Iraqi forces were supported by M1 Abrams tanks, M2 Bradley armored fighting vehicles, one platoon of cannon artillery (155mm M109A6 Paladin howitzers) from the North Carolina Army National Guard, 25th ID 2nd BCT, 1-14th INF and the 1st ID 2nd BCT, C Co. 2/108 INF 27th BCT (NYARNG), B Co. 2/108 INF 27th BCT (NYARNG), 1-26th INF Task Force that was responsible for securing Samarra. Additional forces from 1-18th IN TF, 1-77th AR TF, 1-4 Cav supported this operation and smoke support from 12th Chemical Co. They focused on capturing major government and police buildings. After heavy street fighting, American and Iraqi forces controlled about half the city after the first day of fighting. CNN reporter Jane Arraf entered the city with US troops and covered the battle live. Fighting continued for two more days before the entire city was secured. Around 90 weapons caches were captured during the course of the operation.  Aftermath  After the battle, American forces began a program to provide security, build up the local police forces, and spent tens of millions of dollars on public works projects and hospitals. These initiatives brought some measure of security to the city, however, this did not prevent the bombing of the Golden Mosque in February 2006.

July 1746 - August 1805) was a native of Senegal and former slave from Saint-Domingue in the French West Indies who during the period of the French Revolution became a member of the National Convention and the Council of Five Hundred of France. He was also known as Mars.Hall, Catherine, Review of The Birth of the Modern World 1780‚Äì1914: Global Connections and Comparisons, by C. A. Bayly online at history.ac.uk, accessed 7 August 2008 Life Belley was said to have been born on 1 July 1746 or 1747 on the island of Gor√©e, Senegal, but the precise dates of his birth and death are uncertain. At the age of two, he was sold to slavers sailing for the French colony of Saint-Domingue. With his savings, he later bought his freedom. In 1791, the enslaved Africans of Saint-Domingue began the Haitian Revolution, aimed at the overthrow of the colonial regime. As their fellow revolutionaries in France thought the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1789, they began to see that slavery would need to be abolished. In 1793, Belley was a Captain of infantry, fought against the colonists of Saint- Domingue and was six times wounded. On 24 September 1793, he was one of three members (deput√©s) elected to the French National Convention by the northern region of Saint-Domingue, together with Jean-Baptiste Mills, of mixed race, and Louis-Pierre Dufa√ø, a European, thus becoming the first black deputy to take a seat in the Convention.(French) Jean-Baptiste Belley, d√©put√© de Saint- Domingue √† la Convention at histoire-image.org, accessed 7 August 2008 On 3 February 1794, he spoke in a debate in the Convention when it decided unanimously to abolish slavery. However, the formal abolition of slavery did not disarm the European colonists' supporters, although he was recognized as a full citizen of the Republic. When Beno√Æt Gouly, a pro-slavery deputy from Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, called for special laws for the colonies, Belley denounced a pressure group of colonists meeting at the H√¥tel Massiac called Club de l'h√¥tel de MassiacThe club of reactionary colonial proprietors meeting since July 1789 at the H√¥tel Massiac werere opposed to representation in the Assembl√©e of France's overseas dominions, for fear \\"that this would expose delicate colonial issues to the hazards of debate in the Assembly,\\" as Robin Blackburn expressed it (Blackburn, The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery, 1776-1848 (1988:174f). These opponents of the anti-slavery Amis des Noirs included Pierre-Victor Malouet, a leader of the monarchiens, and Moreau de Saint-M√©ry, President of the Electors of Paris, who received the keys to the fallen Bastille, which were later presented to another slaveholder, George Washington (noted by Blackburn, 174). in a speech published under the title Le Bout d'oreille des colons, ou le syst√®me de l‚ÄôH√¥tel Massiac mis √† jour par Gouly.\\"The planters' cloven hoof revealed, or the H√¥tel Massiac project published by Gouly\\". The \\"ear-tip\\", the bout d'oreille of the title, refers to La Fontaine's couplet, from L'Ane v√™tu d'une Peau de Lion (\\"The Ass Dressed in a Lion Skin\\"): Un petit bout d'oreille, echapp√© par malheur, / D√©couvrit la fourbe et l'erreur... (A small bit of ear-tip, unluckily escaped, uncovered the ruse and the error...). He succeeded for a time in maintaining the Republican principle of equality between people in France and in its colonies, whatever their colour. In a declaration of age and marital status for the representatives of Saint-Domingue in the Convention, Belley says that he was born at Gor√©e, is forty-eight years old, has never left the territory of the Republic, and has lived forty six years at Cap-Fran√ßais.(French) Declaration of age and marital status , manuscript conserved at the Centre historique des Archives nationales, Paris, photograph online at histoire-image.org, accessed 7 August 2008 In a 'declaration of fortune' dated at Paris on 10 Vend√©miaire, Year 4 of the Republic (viz., 1 October 1795), Belley declares that from the Republic he has only his 'emoluments', that he has bought no property, and that he owns only the contents of his room.(French) Declaration of fortune , manuscript conserved at the Centre historique des Archives nationales, Paris, photograph online at histoire-image.org, accessed 7 August 2008 Belley remained as a Convention member until 1797, when he lost his seat. He returned to Saint-Domingue with Charles Leclerc's expedition of 1802 as an officer of gendarmes, but he was arrested, sent back to France and imprisoned in the fortress of Belle √éle. He was still being held prisoner there in 1805 when he wrote to Isaac Louverture, the son of Toussaint Louverture. He died later the same year. Portrait In about 1797, Belley's portrait was painted by Anne- Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson (1767-1824), a former pupil of Jacques-Louis David, and was exhibited in Paris in 1798. In this painting, Girodet evokes the tensions of the period. Belley, standing, wears the uniform of a Convention member, with a tropical landscape behind him, and has a stylish relaxed pose, as favoured in many French political portraits of Revolutionary politicians. His elbow rests on a bust of the philosopher Guillaume-Thomas Raynal (1713‚Äì1796), author of A Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of the Europeans in the East and West Indies (1770).L'histoire philosophique et politique des √©tablissements et du commerce des Europ√©ens dans les deux Indes (1770) Raynal, who had just died, had been a supporter of the abolition of slavery.Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy~Trioson at safran-arts.com, accessed 7 August 2008 A drawing by Girodet for the portrait in ink and black chalk is in the Art Institute of Chicago, the restricted gift of the Joseph and Helen Regenstein Foundation, 1973.Southgate, M.

As an artist he is known for his quipus, a reinterpretation of an ancient Andean device, they are considered precursors of conceptual art.Bay√≥n, \\"Art\\", p. 427. Eielson was born in Lima. His father died when he was seven years old so he was raised by his mother. At a young age he developed artistic tendencies: he played the piano, drew copiously and recited poetry. Eielson switched schools several times until at the end of his secondary education he met the anthropologist and writer Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas who introduced him to the artistic and literary circles of Lima as well as to the knowledge of the ancient civilizations of Peru.Canfield, Jorge Eielson . Retrieved August 3, 2008. Eielson started studies at the National University of San Marcos in 1941. He won the National Poetry Award three years later and the National Drama Award in 1948, when he also held a successful art exhibition at the Lima Gallery .Tauro, Enciclopedia, vol. VI, p. 883. In the same year, he traveled to Paris under a French government scholarship, in that city he exhibited at the Colette Allendy gallery before traveling to Switzerland thanks to a UNESCO scholarship. In 1951, he travels to Italy for a summer vacation and decides to settle permanently in Rome. During this period he wrote the collection of poems Habitaci√≥n en Roma and two novels: El cuerpo de Giulia-No and Primera muerte de Mar√≠a. In the late 1950s, he abandoned avant-garde and resorts to using materials such as earth, sand and clay to sculpt in the canvas surface; at first he uses this technique to depict landscapes but gradually moves towards human figures represented through clothing of various kinds. In 1963 he started his first quipu, reinventing this ancient Andean device with fabrics of brilliant colors, knotted and tied on canvas. Eielson's quipus were exhibited in the 1964 Venice Biennale to wide acclaim. In the mid 1970s, he traveled to Peru where he devoted himself to the study of pre-Columbian art; during this period, the Instituto Nacional de Cultura (National Institute of Culture) published most of his poetry under the title Poes√≠a escrita.

Honda currently makes the 2010 Elite. Elite 80 In 1984, Honda released its first four-stroke modern scooter, the Elite 125. Later, Honda introduced the four-stroke Elite 80 (model code CH80) in 1985. Production was moved from Japan to Mexico in 1991, and production ended in 2007. The Elite 80 had a 23 model year run with only minor changes. Elite 125/150 Honda released its first mid-sized four-stroke scooter onto the western market in the spring of 1984. The Elite 125 (CH125) continued Honda's trend of shifting from two- stroke engines to the much more emissions friendly four-stroke engine. The Elite was called the Honda Spacy in Europe. The 1984 Elite featured many new technologies never before seen on a conventional scooter, such as a retractable headlamp, liquid-cooled engine, a digital dashboard, and more. For 1985, Honda brought back its mid-sized scooter along with some modifications. Two of these changes were that the engine size was increased from to (thus changing the model name to the Elite 150) and that the Elite 150 was now being sold in two editions, the standard model, and a deluxe model. The deluxe model (CH150D) shared an almost identical body and frame as the Elite 125, including a digital instrument cluster and flip-up headlamp, while the standard model (CH150) got a more conventional specification, including an analog dashboard, and a fixed headlamp. 1986 saw the elimination of the standard model Elite 150, leaving the Deluxe model as the only remaining mid-sized scooter Honda had to offer. Styling revisions for the Honda CH150 in 1987 included a transition from a boxy to a curvier, more rounded look. Although its appearance differed from its predecessor, the revised Elite 150 received few mechanical modifications. Despite the design changes the CH150 received in 1987, it was the last year this model was produced. Elite E The Honda Elite E was launched in the late 1980s. The Elite E shares the fixed-ratio transmission with its cousin the Honda Spree, rather than the CVT of the standard Elite and Dio models.

Until the mid-1990s, academic exam boards and vocational accreditors were run very much as separate organisations. In more recent times, this distinction has been removed, with all the term 'awarding bodies' now being used. This article focuses on the contemporary and historical awarding bodies that set academic exams in state schools. In everyday terminology, these organisations are still referred to as 'exam boards'. Broadly speaking, the UK has always had two separate school systems: one for England, Wales and Northern Ireland; and one for Scotland. As a result, two separate sets of exam boards have been developed. England, Wales and Northern Ireland England, Wales and Northern Ireland have several exam boards; schools and colleges can choose freely between them on a subject-by- subject basis. Currently, there are five exam boards available to state schools: * AQA (Assessment and Qualifications Alliance) * CCEA (Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment) * OCR (Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations) * Pearson, under its Edexcel brand * WJEC (Welsh Joint Education Committee), under its WJEC and Eduqas brands Though the exam boards have regional roots (see below), they now operate across larger areas. The three boards based in England ‚Äì AQA, OCR and Edexcel ‚Äì offer all their qualifications across England with a smaller number in Wales (where no 'homegrown' qualification is available) and Northern Ireland (where the qualifications meet the regulator's requirements). The Wales-based WJEC offers qualifications in Wales (mostly under its WJEC brand), England (nearly always under its Eduqas brand) and Northern Ireland (under either brand). CCEA, despite previously offering qualifications in England and Wales, now only operates in Northern Ireland. Most exam boards offer a range of qualifications, though not all boards offer every qualification in every subject. Schools and colleges have a completely free choice between the boards, depending on the qualification offered. Most schools use a mixture of boards for their GCSE qualifications, with a similar mixture existing at A Level. In addition, a school using one board for a particular GCSE subject is free to use a different board for the equivalent subject at A Level. HistoryEarly beginnings= Exam boards have been around as long as there have been qualifications offered by schools. As universities had experience of offering qualifications, such as degrees, it was natural that they created the first exam boards. Indeed, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge each had their own exam board and a joint board they ran together. The qualifications offered were generally of the boards' own creation. Schools and colleges (with some exceptions, detailed below) were free to pick which board they wanted to use, though most went for a local board. The early boards established included: * 1856: Society of Arts, the Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, later the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (Royal Society of Arts) * 1857: University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (founded by the University of Oxford) * 1858: University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES, founded by the University of Cambridge) * 1858: University of Durham Matriculation and School Examination Board (founded by the University of Durham) * 1873: Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board (founded by the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge) * 1896: Central Welsh Board (founded by the Welsh local authorities) * 1900: University of Birmingham * 1902: University of London Extension Board (founded by the University of London) * 1903: Joint Matriculation Board (JMB, founded by the Victoria University of Manchester, the University of Liverpool and the University of Leeds) * 1911: University of Bristol School Examinations Council (founded by the University of Bristol) The Central Welsh Board differed from most exam boards, as it was not controlled by a university and only offered examinations to schools and colleges in Wales. Intermediate schools in Wales had to use the Board, though other schools and colleges were free to choose. The University of Birmingham disbanded its own exam board and joined the JMB in 1916. =School Certificate and Higher School Certificate= In 1918, the first national qualifications for England, Wales and Northern Ireland were introduced: the School Certificate, taken at 16, and the Higher School Certificate, taken at 18. The existing exam boards started offering the new qualifications, normally in place of their own qualifications. In 1930, the University of London Extension Board renamed itself the University of London Matriculation and School Examinations Council before becoming University of London University Entrance and School Examinations Council and School Examinations Department in 1951. The University of Durham Matriculation and School Examination Board renamed itself the Durham University Examinations Board in the 1930s. The Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) was founded by the Welsh local authorities in 1948. It took over many of the Central Welsh Board's responsibilities, including running Wales's exam system. =GCE (O Level and A Level)= In 1951, the General Certificate of Education (GCE) was introduced. It was split into two stages: Ordinary Level (O Level, taken at 16) and Advanced Level (A Level, taken at 18). These qualifications replaced the School Certificate and the Higher School Certificate respectively. The existing exam boards offered the GCE, alongside the Northern Ireland Schools Examination Council . These boards were soon joined by the Associated Examining Board (AEB), which was founded by City & Guilds in 1953. The Southern Universities' Joint Board for School Examinations was founded in 1954 as a successor to the University of Bristol School Examinations Council. The Durham University Examinations Board ceased to exist in 1964. The University of London University Entrance and School Examinations Council and School Examinations Department was renamed the University of London School Examinations Board in 1984. =CSE= In 1965, the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) was introduced. It was aimed at the 80% of 16-year-old students who did not take O Levels and, until then, had left school with no qualifications. CSEs were administered on a local basis, with local boards offering the qualifications. The local boards in England were new organisations, while in Wales and Northern Ireland (where universities did not control the existing boards) the existing boards were used. The CSE boards were: * Associated Lancashire Schools Examining Board * East Anglian Examinations Board * East Midland Regional Examinations Board * Metropolitan Regional Examination Board * Middlesex Regional Examination Board * Northern Ireland Schools Examination Council * North Regional Examinations Board * North West Regional Examinations Board * South-East Regional Examinations Board * South Western Examinations Board * Southern Regional Examination Board * Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) * West Midlands Regional Examination Board * West Yorkshire and Lindsey Regional Examining Board * Yorkshire Regional Examinations Board In 1979, the neighbouring Metropolitan and Middlesex boards merged to form the London Regional Examinations Board. The West Yorkshire and Lindsey, and Yorkshire and Humberside Boards also merged to form the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Examinations Board in 1982. =GCSE= To create a more egalitarian system, the O Levels and CSE (but not the A Level) were replaced by the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) in 1986. As O Levels and CSEs had used different exam boards (except in Wales and Northern Ireland), new 'examining groups' were created. In England, the four examining groups were consortia of regional GCE and CSE exam boards, while in Wales and Northern Ireland they were the existing boards, making six boards in total: * London East Anglian Group (formed by the University of London School Examinations Board, the London Regional Examination Board and the East Anglian Examinations Board) * Midland Examining Group (MEG, formed by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the Southern Universities' Joint Board, the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board, East Midland Regional Examinations Board and the West Midlands Examinations Board) * Northern Examining Association (NEA, formed by the Joint Matriculation Board, the Associated Lancashire Schools Examining Board, the North Regional Examinations Board, the North West Regional Examinations Board and the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Examinations Board) * Northern Ireland Schools Examination Council * Southern Examining Group (SEG, formed by the Associated Examining Board, the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations, the South-East Regional Examinations Board, South Western Examinations Board and Southern Regional Exams Board) * Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) As CSEs were no longer offered, the CSE boards effectively ceased to operate as independent boards and instead became part of their larger examining groups (some were even taken over by larger members of their groups, such as the South East Regional Examinations Board, which was acquired by the Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations in 1985 to form the Oxford School Examinations Board; and the South-East Regional Examinations Board and South Western Examinations Board, which merged with the AEB in 1985 and 1987 respectively). The GCE boards, however, retained a degree of autonomy, as they still offered A Levels independently. Though the boards were regional, schools were entirely free to pick which board they did their GCSE qualifications with and could mix and match between subjects. When the Certificate of Achievement (now the Entry Level Certificate, a qualification below GCSE level) was introduced, the GCSE examining groups were responsible for administering the qualification. =Creation of the current boards= It was not long before the GCE (A Level) boards and GCSE examining groups began to formally merge or enter into even closer working relationships. This made sense, as it allowed merged boards to offer both GCSE and A Level qualifications and the boards were working together to offer the GCSE qualifications anyway. Many boards also took the opportunity to merge with vocational exam boards, as vocational qualifications became more common in schools. The government encouraged this, as they wanted to simplify the system by having fewer exam boards. AQA All five members of the Northern Examining Association merged in 1992 to form NEAB. In 1994, the Oxford Schools Examinations Board sold its GCSE functions to the Associated Examining Board, who renamed themselves AEB/SEG (OSEB's A Level functions went to UCLES). NEAB, AEB/SEG and the vocational City & Guilds formed the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA) in 1997, with the AEB/SEG and NEAB formally merging into AQA in 2000 (City & Guilds chose to remain independent, but closely cooperates with AQA). AQA is run as an educational charity. OCR The University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES) took over the Southern Universities' Joint Board in 1990 and the Midland Examining Group (MEG) in 1993. When the Oxford Schools Examinations Board was abolished in 1995, its A Level functions were transferred to UCLES (its GCSE functions went to AEB/SEG). In the same year, UCLES also took over the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board (OCSEB). UCLES then merged all its A Level boards together to form the Oxford and Cambridge Examinations and Assessment Council (OCEAC). This left UCLES offering A Levels under the OCSEB name, GCSEs under the MEG name and some vocational qualifications under the UODLE name. This situation continued until 1998, when UCLES took over the vocational Royal Society of Arts Examinations Board. Following the merger, it chose to use the name Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR) for all its UK qualifications. OCR is now the only major exam board owned by a university and is still run by the University of Cambridge, through its Cambridge Assessment division. Cambridge Assessment also controls CIE, a predominately international exam board. CIE started offering some qualifications to English, Welsh and Northern Irish state schools in 2008, though it later withdrew from this market when the reformed GCSEs and A Levels (examined 2017 onwards) were introduced. Edexcel The University of London School Examinations Board merged with the London and East Anglian Group to form the University of London Examinations & Assessment Council (known as London Examinations or ULEAC) in 1991. In 1996, London Examinations merged with the vocational BTEC to form the Edexcel Foundation (the legal entity called London Qualifications). Though it originally ran as an educational charity like AQA, the Foundation was taken over by Pearson in 2003 (and renamed simply Edexcel), making it the only British exam board to be run by a profit-making company. CCEA The Northern Ireland Schools Examination Council became the Northern Ireland School Examinations and Assessment Council before being replaced by the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) in 1994. It is a non-departmental public body. ICAAE, a division of ICAA, was founded in 1989. It specialises in a small number of business and ICT courses. It began offering GCSEs in 1997, in partnership with CCEA. In 2009, it began offering exams independently of CCEA. It stopped offering such exams a few years later. WJEC Unlike the other boards, WJEC did not experience any major organisational changes and is still owned by the Welsh local authorities, though it operates independently. In 2014, WJEC launched a new brand, Eduqas, for new Ofqual-accredited qualifications (mostly offered in England), while retaining the name WJEC for Welsh Government-regulated qualifications. Scotland There is just one exam board in Scotland, the SQA (Scottish Qualifications Authority), which offers all Scotland's qualifications. History Previously, academic qualifications were awarded by the Scottish Examination Board (SEB), and prior to that the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board (SCEEB), while vocational qualifications were awarded by the Scottish Vocational Education Council (SCOTVEC). Examination boards working together The UK's examination boards sometimes work together. For example, they sometimes offer qualifications jointly or share training materials for common parts of specifications. The JCQ (Joint Council for Qualifications) is a common voice for UK exam boards. The JCQ is made up of AQA, CCEA, City & Guilds, Edexcel, OCR, SQA and WJEC. Among its roles, it devises standard rules for exams and publishes statistics.

It also provides care for newborn infants, and may act as a centre for clinical training in midwifery and obstetrics. Formerly known as lying-in hospitals, most of them, like cottage hospitals, have been absorbed into larger general hospitals, where they operate as the maternity department. History The premises of the former General Lying-In Hospital, now a hotel Maternity hospitals in the United Kingdom can be traced back to a number of 18th century establishments in London and Dublin. Prior to these foundations, childbirth was a domestic occasion. The term coined for these establishments, but now archaic, is \\"a lying-in hospital\\", referring to the custom of lying- in, prolonged bedrest after childbirth, better known now as postpartum confinement. The first noted lying-in hospital appears to be one founded by Sir Richard Manningham in Jermyn Street, London, in 1739 and which evolved into the Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital. A better documented foundation is that of the Dublin Lying-In Hospital, established in 1745 by Bartholomew Mosse, and which served as a model for three subsequent London foundations: the British Lying-In Hospital, a 1749 establishment in Holborn; the 1750 City of London Lying-In Hospital, in the City; and the General Lying-In Hospital on Westminster Bridge Road, established in 1767. A number of other such hospitals were formed in the mid-18th century. All of these were run by male physicians, women being blocked from completing training as doctors until the 1870s. The first maternity hospital founded and run by a woman was Elizabeth Garrett Anderson's New Hospital for Women, which evolved from an existing dispensary in the 1770s, and was renamed in 1918 the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital.UCLH - Our hospitals - University College Hospital Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Wing Its work continues in the modern Elizabeth Garrett Anderson maternity wing of University College Hospital, part of UCLH NHS Foundation Trust. Today The Portland Hospital in central London was created in 1983 as a private hospital, i.e. not part of the National Health Service.

As of 2019, the foundation had made grants totaling more than $722 million since its inception. It is the second- largest charitable foundation in Cleveland. History=Formation The George Gund Foundation was created in 1952 as a private foundation by George Gund II, a businessman living in Cleveland, Ohio. Gund inherited a sizeable brewing industry fortune from his father. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Food and Fuel Control Act into law on August 10, 1917, which banned the manufacture of retail liquor and beer for the duration of the emergency created by World War I. Unable to make beer, in May 1919 Gund purchased all 15,000 shares of the American subsidiary of the German company Kaffee HAG, which had developed a process for manufacturing instant decaffeinated coffee.; Spending just $318,768 ($ in dollars) to purchase the company, Gund sold it to Kellogg's in 1927 for $10 million ($ in dollars). Gund became a major stockholder in Kellogg's, and invested in banking, insurance, and real estate. Among his investments was the purchase of a significant amount of stock in the Cleveland Trust Company, a small Cleveland bank. He was named a director of the bank in 1937, its president in 1941, and chairman of the board in 1962. Gund transformed the bank into Cleveland's largest bank; at the time of his death, it was the 18th largest bank in the United States. He was one of Cleveland's richest men at the time of his death in 1966, worth about $200 million ($ in dollars). At the end of 1953, the George Gund Foundation had assets worth just $166,878 ($ in dollars). The foundation received certification from the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization in 1955. By 1960, it had about $30 million ($ in dollars) in assets. Disbursement of funds to various causes left the George Gund Foundation with just $16.4 million ($ in dollars) in assets by 1964. In the 1950s, the foundation focused primarily on education and grants were small, ranging from $10 to $10,000. Grant amounts began to become substantially larger after 1960. Transition period At Gund's death in November 1966, his estate was worth about $24.5 million ($ in dollars) after the payment of debts and fees. The bulk of his estate went to the George Gund Foundation. With this contribution, the fund's assets rose to just over $40 million ($ in dollars). George Gund II's death left the foundation in the hands of four trustees: His 27-year-old son, Gordon Gund; George F. Karch, chairman of the Cleveland Trust Company; Frederick K. Cox, vice chairman of the Cleveland Trust Company; and Hawley E. Stark, corporate legal counsel for the Cleveland Trust Company. The latter three were all George Gund II's close friends. Stark became the foundation's president. In 1967, 1968, and 1969, the George Gund Foundation made $9 million worth of donations, of which $6.5 million went to name buildings and programs in honor of George Gund II. Expansion in vision In 1969, the foundation hired its first full-time staff person. This was James S. Lipscomb, and he served as executive director of the George Gund Foundation from 1969 until his death in June 1987. During Lipscomb's tenure, the foundation trustees began re-examining the foundation's focus and decided to widen its focus to include civic, cultural, social, economic, and environmental needs. For the first time, the George Gund Foundation began supporting community organizations and began making grants to nonprofits working in the areas of affordable housing, child abuse prevention, drug abuse prevention, gun control, and juvenile justice. Under Lipscomb's guidance, the foundation's assets grew significantly from 1970 to 1981, reaching $83 million ($ in dollars). By 1972, George Gund III and Albrecht Saalfield (Agnes Gund husband) had joined the board of trustees, and by 1986 there were seven staff working alongside the executive director. The foundation made $45 million in grants from 1970 to 1981, and another $50 million in grants from 1982 to 1988. Hawley E. Stark retired from the board of trustees in 1973, and Frederick K. Cox became the foundation's president. Geoffrey Gund joined the board in 1976. Henry C. Doll served as Acting Executive Director from Lipscomb's death until August 1988. He was succeeded as acting director in September 1988 by Richard M. Donaldson. David Bergholz, the assistant director of the Allegheny Conference on Economic Development, was named the new executive director in November 1988. He began his tenure in January 1989.; Berholz executive directorship In 1990, the George Gund Foundation had assets of about $303.5 million ($ in dollars), and donated just over $11.9 million ($ in dollars) in grants that year alone. Frederick K. Cox died in 1994, and Geoffrey Gund became president. At the time he assumed the presidency, the Gund Foundation had just two full-time staff and was making about $3.5 million ($ in dollars) in grants annually. In the 1990s, the Gund Foundation gave $15 million ($ in dollars) to the Great Lakes Science Center to help construct its building. Made to help improve the city's cultural offerings in time for the city's bicentennial in 1996, it was the largest single grant in the foundation's history. By 2002, however, the foundation had given $25 million over several years to the Foundation Fighting Blindness. Catherine Gund, Agnes Gund Saalfield's daughter, joined the board in 1998. By 2002, the Gund Foundation's board of trustees had grown to eight. Six Gund family members were on the board of trustees, including newly appointed trustee Zachary Gund (Gordon's son). The foundation had also begun to expand its grantmaking to include boosting nonprofit organizations doing good work but which needed funds to reorganize, reorient, or merely overcome bad luck in order to survive. Combined with the recession that began in 2001, the foundation's endowment had shrunk slightly to $425 million ($ in dollars). Bergholz retired at the end of 2002, and was succeeded by David Abbott, president of University Circle Inc. Abbott, a former Cuyahoga County administrator, worked closely with the Gund Foundation as executive director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and as executive director of the Cleveland Bicentennial Commission. Abbott executive directorship In November 2019, Geoffrey Gund retired as president of the George Gund Foundation. The board elected Catherine Gund as his successor. At the time of Geoffrey Gund's retirement, the Gund Foundation was awarding about $25 million ($ in dollars) in grants annually and had a staff of 12. The fund had distributed $722 million in grants during its history, $584 million of which came during Geoffrey Gund's tenure as president. With assets worth $486.9 million ($ in dollars) as of 2018, the George Gund Foundation was Cleveland's second-largest foundation, behind The Cleveland Foundation, Grantmaking The George Gund Foundation's interests include: Arts, Economic Development and Community Revitalization, Education, Environment, and Human Services.

The segments A1X1 and A2X2 are an approximation to first order of the parallel transport of A0X0 along the curve. In the theory of general relativity, and differential geometry more generally, Schild's ladder is a first-order method for approximating parallel transport of a vector along a curve using only affinely parametrized geodesics. The method is named for Alfred Schild, who introduced the method during lectures at Princeton University.  Construction  The idea is to identify a tangent vector x at a point A_0 with a geodesic segment of unit length A_0X_0, and to construct an approximate parallelogram with approximately parallel sides A_0X_0 and A_1X_1 as an approximation of the Levi-Civita parallelogramoid; the new segment A_1X_1 thus corresponds to an approximately parallel translated tangent vector at A_1. { A curve in M with a \\"vector\\" X0 at A0, identified here as a geodesic segment. Select A1 on the original curve. The point P1 is the midpoint of the geodesic segment X0A1. The point X1 is obtained by following the geodesic A0P1 for twice its parameter length. } Formally, consider a curve Œ≥ through a point A0 in a Riemannian manifold M, and let x be a tangent vector at A0. Then x can be identified with a geodesic segment A0X0 via the exponential map. This geodesic œÉ satisfies :\\\\sigma(0)=A_0\\\\, :\\\\sigma'(0) = x.\\\\, The steps of the Schild's ladder construction are: * Let X0 = œÉ(1), so the geodesic segment A_0X_0 has unit length. * Now let A1 be a point on Œ≥ close to A0, and construct the geodesic X0A1. * Let P1 be the midpoint of X0A1 in the sense that the segments X0P1 and P1A1 take an equal affine parameter to traverse. * Construct the geodesic A0P1, and extend it to a point X1 so that the parameter length of A0X1 is double that of A0P1. * Finally construct the geodesic A1X1. The tangent to this geodesic x1 is then the parallel transport of X0 to A1, at least to first order.  Approximation  This is a discrete approximation of the continuous process of parallel transport. If the ambient space is flat, this is exactly parallel transport, and the steps define parallelograms, which agree with the Levi-Civita parallelogramoid. In a curved space, the error is given by holonomy around the triangle A_1A_0X_0, which is equal to the integral of the curvature over the interior of the triangle, by the Ambrose-Singer theorem; this is a form of Green's theorem (integral around a curve related to integral over interior), and in the case of Levi-Civita connections on surfaces, of Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem.  Notes  # Schild's ladder requires not only geodesics but also relative distance along geodesics. Relative distance may be provided by affine parametrization of geodesics, from which the required midpoints may be determined. # The parallel transport which is constructed by Schild's ladder is necessarily torsion-free. # A Riemannian metric is not required to generate the geodesics. But if the geodesics are generated from a Riemannian metric, the parallel transport which is constructed in the limit by Schild's ladder is the same as the Levi-Civita connection because this connection is defined to be torsion-free.

History The Salt Lick was opened in Driftwood in 1967 by Thurman Roberts, Sr. and his wife Hisako T. Roberts. It quickly grew in popularity and went from being open just a few times a year to seven days a week. Roberts and Hisako built the Salt Lick restaurant on the ranch where he was born, using locally quarried limestone. Hisako's Hawaiian heritage inspired the sweet barbecue sauce used in the restaurant. Thurman died in 1981, leaving Hisako in charge of The Salt Lick until 1985, when she passed control of the restaurant to its current owners, Scott Roberts (son of Thurman and Hisako) and Scott's wife Susan. The Salt Lick's primary cuisine is beef (brisket), sausage, and pork ribs. Chicken, beef ribs, turkey, pulled pork and prime rib are also served. Merchandise available from the restaurant or by mail order includes t-shirts, koozies and hats, as well as the restaurant's trademark meats, sauces and dry rub. Salt Lick branch restaurants also operate in the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Oklahoma City Will Rogers World Airport and in Round Rock, Texas. In 2017, the restaurant began operating two concession stands at Darrell K Royal‚ÄìTexas Memorial Stadium, the home of Texas Longhorns football in Austin, Texas. In May 2017, the city of Grapevine, Texas announced that Salt Lick would open a 10,000 square foot branch in the city in 2018. A Grapevine city councilwoman described the announcement as \\"a big night for us\\" and \\"something to celebrate\\", while the head of Grapevine's visitor's bureau described it as \\"a massive opportunity for Grapevine.\\" On television In the fall of 1986, The Salt Lick with chef Tim Adler and owner Hisako Roberts, were featured in the Great Chefs of the West television series, seen first on PBS nationally, then the Discovery Channel and later in 2007, on the Travel Channel. In late 2008 The Salt Lick was featured during an Austin episode in the first season of the Travel Channel's show Man v. Food (hosted by Adam Richman), and the restaurant was positively reviewed by Food Network chefs Bobby Flay and Duff Goldman. Then in 2012 it was featured on another Travel Channel show, Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America, for its spicy brisket jalape√±o sandwich topped with habanero sauce (which was recommended to Richman by Flay).

The ACCG is a 501(c)4 non-profit organization chartered in the American state of Missouri. Mission According to its bylaws, the purpose of the Ancient Coin Collectors Guild is to promote and nurture the free and independent collecting of coins from antiquity. This is undertaken by volunteers through education, political action, and consumer protection. The goal of the ACCG is to foster an environment in which the general public is able to confidently and legally acquire and hold, for personal or professional use, any numismatic item of historical interest regardless of date or place of origin. Governance The ACCG is governed by an elected board of seven Directors. Daily business of the guild is managed by an Executive Director. The guild has no paid employees. Membership categories range from Friend to Benefactor with varying levels of contribution distinguishing the membership level. The ACCG is an umbrella organization for 24 Affiliate Member organizations boasting a total membership of nearly 6,000 collectors. Activities Activities of the ACCG have mainly been directed toward legislative or governmental agency lobbying and educational programs related to cultural property management or youth programs. For example, the ACCG opposes any changes to the Memorandum of Understanding that the State Department's Cultural Property Advisory Committee has with Italy, that would mean ancient coins no longer have unrestricted entry into the United States. 2010 federal lawsuit In July 2010, the ACCG filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The lawsuit sought to recover 23 ancient coins that the ACCG had ordered from a coin dealer in London and which were seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Baltimore on April 24, 2009. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit on August 8, 2011, and the ACCG may file an appeal.

It was excavated in fragments in the Perserschutt in the Acropolis of Athens in 1864. The statue, dated c. 560 BC and estimated to have originally measured 1.65 meters (5.4 ft) in height, is now in the Acropolis Museum in Athens, Greece. Condition The condition of the Moschophoros is poor and broken in some areas. The legs are missing below the knees on both sides. The hands are broken off. The genitals and the left thigh have separated from the whole sculpture. The lower half of the face (the chin area) is chipped off. The foot with a plinth is connected to base. The calf is well preserved, while Moschophoros's eyes are absent. The rest of the sculpture is in a fine state. History The sculpture was found on the Athenian Acropolis in 1864. In 1887, the base was discovered. It is made of permeable limestone, and its plinth was attached to the right foot of the sculpture. The inscription on that plinth claims that this statue was dedicated by someone named Rhombos (possibly Kombos or Bombos; the beginning of the name is missing) to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. This suggests that the sponsor was a very well-to-do- man and a prominent citizen of Attica who offered his own likeness to Athena. He has a calf on his shoulders which represents the sacrificial offering he is about to give to the goddess. Form and relevance The Moschophoros stands with his left foot a little forward, like other kouroi. He has a thick beard, a symbol of adulthood. He wears a thin cloak. The sculpture's nudity is the main aspect of the art as it adhered to the artistic conventions of the era. The cloak on the other hand, depicts him as a respectable and well-recognized citizen. The challenge of representing man and animal together is successfully accomplished by this Archaic sculpture. The calf's legs are held firmly, making a bold X-shaped composition. This interaction between the calf and the calf-bearer represents a strong, inseparable bond between the two. The man in the sculpture is smiling, in a feature referred to as the Archaic smile, which began in the 6th century BCE. Kriophoros statues, of a man with a sheep on his shoulders in a similar manner, are more common. Style Moschophoros's hair is very curly, encircling his forehead. There are three plaits on each side falling over his chest. The hair at the top is tied with a narrow ribbon. He has a thick beard that curves around his shaved upper and lower lip. The eyes are large and were made out of colored stones. The stones are absent now but it gave a more lively appeal to the statue before. His mouth is very diligently carved and outlined. By looking at its form and style, this sculpture is typical in its composition of the early 6th century B.C., around 570 B.C. Interpretation The main idea of a connection between a man and an animal is strongly portrayed. The crossed legs of the calf with the arms of the calf-bearer creates unity between them. The forms are simple such as the round face, eyes and mouth are created with simple arcs. The beard represents an adult man. The body structure is well built depicting strength and power. His mouth and eyes are round in form giving the impression of a positive person, especially, as the man wears a smile on his face.

He was born in Tuburan, Cebu to Roberto Maxilom, the town gobernadorcillo, and Gregoria Molero. His family were members of the local gentry, or principal√≠a. He worked as a teacher in the local school before joining the Katipunan, whose activities in Cebu were led by a young Negrense, Le√≥n Kilat. After Kilat's betrayal and assassination, Maxilom continued the revolution in Cebu. Under his command, the Katipunan was able to regroup in the central highlands, which Spanish forces found impenetrable. On December 16, 1898, Maxilom wrote a letter to the Spanish authorities in Cebu, demanding that the latter surrender. Weary after incessant fighting, the Spaniards quickly responded, asking Maxilom for two to three days to leave the province. By Christmas Eve, the Spaniards had left, leaving behind only three Catholic clerics. Self-rule would be short-lived. In the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, signed that month, December 1898, Spain sold the Philippines to the United States for twenty million dollars. Maxilom is best remembered for stubbornly refusing to surrender to the American forces even as his fellow revolutionaries in Manila and Cebu were starting to capitulate or collaborate with the new colonial power. He surrendered on October 27, 1901. Virtually forgotten after the revolution, Maxilom died in his hometown of Tuburan, after a long bout with paralysis, on August 10, 1924. His funeral cort√®ge, joined in by leading revolutionary figures including Emilio Aguinaldo, stretched some four kilometers, in what remains to this day the longest in Cebu's history.

Including recordings made with his brother Lionel Belmondo and Yusef Lateef, he won the best French album category (L'Album fran√ßais de l'ann√©e) in 2003, 2004 and 2005, and the best artist award (L'Artiste ou la Formation instrumentale fran√ßaise de l'ann√©e) in 2003 and 2004. in the French Victoires du Jazz awards. Along with his brother, he is noted for tribute albums that involve the musicians being honored.All About Jazz  Biography  The Belmondo family say music came naturally to Stephane, before he could even speak. His father, Yvan, was proud of his son, but inflexible when it came down to his musical education. As a former professional saxophonist, he understood the necessity of discipline and practicing music requires. He was able to instill these values into his son from an early age and Belmondo quickly adopted these principles. He first started with drums and percussion instruments at the age of 6, accordion at 8, and took up the trumpet at age 10. He studied accordion and cornet at the Aix- en-Provence Conservatory of Music, before being admitted to the trumpet class of the Marseille Conservatory at 16. Belmondo was 14 when he finally took the stage with his accordion joining the big band led by his father and brother Lionel who played saxophone. When he and his brother started a quintet, Belmondo was 15 years old. When Belmondo arrived in Paris to pursue his career, he met pianist Ren√© Urtreger, who gave him many opportunities to share the stage, notably with famed double-bassist Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen. He also worked with Pierre Michelot and Al Levitt, among many others. In 1987, shortly after his arrival in Paris, he joined Laurent Cugny's big band, Lumi√®re. Cugny had convinced arranger Gil Evans to come to France and work on the orchestra's repertoire. The collaboration resulted in two albums Rhythm-A- Ning and a European tour where Belmondo also recorded and performed with.

He is the host of The Situation Room and also serves as the network's lead political anchor. Early life Blitzer was born in Augsburg, West Germany,Encyclopedia of television news, By Michael D. Murray, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, . the son of Cesia Blitzer (n√©e Zylberfuden), a homemaker, and David Blitzer, a home builder. His parents were Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Poland who survived the Auschwitz concentration camp; his grandparents, two uncles, and two aunts on his father's side all died there. Blitzer and his family immigrated to the United States after World War II, under the provisions of the 1948 Displaced Persons Act. He was raised in Buffalo, New York, and graduated from Kenmore West Senior High School. He received a Bachelor of Arts in history from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1970. While there, he was a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi. In 1972, he received a Master of Arts in International Relations from the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. While at Johns Hopkins, he studied abroad at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he learned Hebrew.New York Magazine. February 11, 1991, p. 36. Name Blitzer has said he has frequently been asked about his name, which has been characterized as seemingly made for TV. He explained that his surname goes back for generations, and his first name, 'Wolf', is the same first name as that of his maternal grandfather. Career=Washington and Jerusalem Blitzer began his career in journalism in the early 1970s, in the Tel Aviv bureau of the Reuters news agency. In 1973, he caught the eye of Jerusalem Post editor Ari Rath, who hired Blitzer as a Washington correspondent for the English language Israeli newspaper. Blitzer remained with the Jerusalem Post until 1990, covering both American politics and developments in the Middle East. Fluent in Hebrew, Blitzer also published articles in several Hebrew-language newspapers. Under the name Ze'ev Blitzer, he wrote for Al HaMishmar. Using the name Ze'ev Barak, he had work published in Yedioth Ahronoth.Blitzer, Wolf. Between Washington and Jerusalem. 1985, page ix. Ze'ev (◊ñ◊ê◊ë) is the Hebrew word for \\"wolf\\" and Barak (◊ë◊®◊ß) is the Hebrew word for \\"lightning\\" (which in German/Yiddish is Blitz/blits). In the mid-1970s, Blitzer also worked for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) as the editor of their monthly publication, the Near East Report. While at AIPAC, Blitzer's writing focused on Middle East affairs as they relate to United States foreign policy. At an April 1977 White House press conference, Blitzer asked Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat why Egyptian scholars, athletes and journalists were not permitted to visit Israel. Sadat responded that such visits would be possible after an end to the state of belligerence between the two nations. In November of that year, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel, and Blitzer covered the negotiations between the two countries from the first joint Israeli-Egyptian press conference in 1977, to the final negotiations that would lead to the signing of the Egypt‚ÄìIsrael Peace Treaty two years later. In 1985, Blitzer published his first book, Between Washington and Jerusalem: A Reporter's Notebook (Oxford University Press, 1985). The text outlined his personal development as a reporter, and the relations between the United States and Israel. Jonathan Pollard In 1986, he became known for his coverage of the arrest and trial of Jonathan Pollard, an American Jew who was charged with spying for Israel. Blitzer was the first journalist to interview Pollard, and he later wrote a book about the Pollard Affair titled Territory of Lies. In the book, Blitzer writes that Pollard contacted him because he had been reading Blitzer's byline for years, and because Blitzer \\"had apparently impressed him as someone who was sympathetic\\".Blitzer, Wolf. Territory of Lies. 1989, page xv. Pollard also hoped that Blitzer would help him \\"reach the people of Israel, as well as the American Jewish community.\\"Blitzer, Wolf. Territory of Lies. 1989, page xix. Blitzer's interview with Pollard was controversial in the context of the legal action against him, as it was construed by some media voices as a possible violation of the terms of Pollard's plea deal, which forbade media contact. Blitzer's subsequent book about the affair was included in The New York Times list of \\"Notable Books of the Year\\" for 1989. In its review, the Times praised the book as \\"lucid and highly readable\\" and called Blitzer's judgment of Israeli officials \\"harsh but fair\\". A review in The New York Review of Books was more critical, prompting a letter from Blitzer accusing the reviewer of making several inaccurate statements. Reviewer Robert I. Friedman responded to Blitzer's criticism by characterizing Territory of Lies as \\"a slick piece of damage control that would make [Blitzer's] former employers at AIPAC (not to mention Israel's Defense Ministry) proud.\\" Pollard was released on November 20, 2015, in accordance with federal guidelines in place at the time of his sentencing.\\"After 30 Years, Jonathan Pollard Released From American Prison.\\" Haaretz.

Brussels, which is majority French-speaking but enclaved in Flanders, may be included within this ideology as may the six Flemish municipalities with language facilities for French-speakers around Brussels. It can be considered a French-speaking equivalent of Orangism or Grootneerlandisme in Flanders. The Rattachist ideology is associated with a faction of the Walloon Movement and is advocated by the political parties Walloon Rally and Wallonia‚ÄìFrance Rally. Neither presently have any parliamentary seats.  History and etymology  The \\"r\\" in \\"rattachism\\" (from \\"re-\\" and \\"attach\\"), indicating a re-unification, is in reference to a future unification being a repeat occurrence, after the previous \\"unity\\" which transpired during the \\"French period\\" (1794‚Äì1815). Present-day Belgium was conquered in 1795 by the French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars. It was annexed to the Republic, which later became the Napoleonic Empire. After the Battle of Waterloo (1815), Wallonia became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands under King William of Orange. Following the 1830 Belgian Revolution Wallonia became a part of the Kingdom of Belgium. Following the Belgian Revolution a minority of Walloons called for unification with France.Jean Stengers, Histoire du sentiment national en Belgique des origines √† 1918, t. I : Les Racines de la Belgique : jusqu'√† la R√©volution de 1830, Bruxelles, Racine, 2000 Four newspapers that supported unification were Le Journal de Verviers, Le Journal de la province de Li√®ge, L'Industrie and L'√âclaireur. At this time Rattachists in Verviers were a majority.Els Witte (trad. du n√©erlandais par Anne-Laure Vignaux), ¬´ La Construction de la Belgique : 1828-1847 Rattachists argued that in order to preserve their economic prosperity they must unite with France and that culturally the place was French. The Regent of Belgium, Erasme Louis Surlet de Chokier was a supporter in this period, as was Charles de Brouck√®re, Charles Rogier and Alexandre Gendebien. After the German Prince Leopold I became King of Belgium in 1831 the Rattachists hopes of unification disappeared. In 1968 President of France and World War 2 hero, Charles de Gaulle stated that \\"If one day a political authority representative of Wallonia were to approach France officially, that day we would respond favourably, with full hearts, to a request that appeared legitimate\\". Current support=In France A 2008 poll published by French newspaper La Voix du Nord found about 60% of French respondents support unification with Wallonia. A November 2007 poll found support at 54% among respondents. A 2010 Institut fran√ßais d'opinion publique (IFOP) poll found that if the Belgian political crisis led to the splitting up of Belgium, 66% of the French respondents would support the unification of Wallonia with France. IFOP has stated support for unification with France had been rising since 2007. French politicians Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, Jacques Myard, Marine Le Pen, and Jean-Luc M√©lenchon have all voiced support for Rattachism. Journalist √âric Zemmour and economist Jacques Attali also support it.M√©lancolie fran√ßaise by √âric Zemmour  In Wallonia  Another poll taken in 2010 during the Belgian political crisis also conducted by IFOP found that 32% of Walloons surveyed would support unification if Belgium splits up. Walloon politicians who have at some point voiced support for the idea are Daniel Ducarme, Jean Gol, and .

The arms Gyronny of eight or and ermine, over all a castle triple-towered sable appear on a funeral hatchment in Rodden Church, Somerset, relating to his daughter Abigail Hooper (1684‚Äì1763), whose husband was John Prowse of Axbridge. Her monument survives in Axbridge Church. (Summers, Peter & Titterton, John, (eds.), Hatchments in Britain, Vol.7: Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Isle of Wight and Somerset; Phillimore Press, Chichester, Sussex, 1988, p.168); Also arms of Nicholas Hooper (1654‚Äì1731), MP for Barnstaple, Devon George Hooper (18 November 1640 ‚Äì 6 September 1727) was a learned and influential English High church cleric of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. He served as bishop of the Welsh diocese, St Asaph, and later for the diocese of Bath and Wells, as well as chaplain to members of the royal family. Early life George Hooper was born at Grimley in Worcestershire, 18 November 1640. His father, also George Hooper, appears to have been a gentleman of independent means; his mother, Joan Hooper, was daughter of Edmund Giles, gentleman, of White Ladies Aston, Worcestershire. From Grimley his parents moved to Westminster. He was elected a scholar of St Paul's School while John Langley was high-master (1640‚Äì1657),Gardiner, St. Paul's School Reg., p.47 but then was transferred to Westminster School under Richard Busby, who thought him very promising, and obtained a king's scholarship there. Hooper as elected to a Westminster studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1657: he graduated BA 16 January 1660, MA 1 December 1663, BD 9 July 1673, and DD 3 July 1677. He remained at Oxford as college tutor until 1672, and made the acquaintance of Thomas Ken. Under Dr. Edward Pococke he became a good Hebrew and Syriac scholar, but also learned enough Arabic to apply it to Old Testament exegesis.Prowse, MS Life of Bishop Hooper (nd) Clergyman In 1673 Bishop Morley persuaded Hooper to come and reside with him as his chaplain at Winchester. Ken was the bishop's chaplain at the same time. In the same year Morley presented Hooper to the living of Havant, where he seems to have gone into residence at once, and contracted an ague from the dampness of the place. Ken, then incumbent at East Woodhay in Hampshire, then resigned the living to make way for his friend. Hooper was instituted at Woodhay in 1672. Isaac Milles, the exemplary parish priest of the neighbouring village of High Clere, frequently mentioned Hooper as \\"the one of all clergymen whom he had ever known in whom the three characters of perfect gentleman, thorough scholar, and venerable divine met in the most complete accordance.\\" Archbishop Sheldon induced Morley to permit Hooper to move to Lambeth Palace to become his own chaplain in 1673. In 1675 he was collated by Sheldon to the rectory of Lambeth, and soon afterwards to the precentorship of Exeter. Morley sent for Hooper to attend him in his last sickness in 1684. Royal chaplain On the marriage of the Princess Mary with the Prince of Orange, Hooper went with her to Holland in 1677 as her almoner at the Hague. Here he had a difficult post to fill, since the Prince's views inclined to the Dutch Presbyterians, and the Princess's former chaplain, Dr. William Lloyd, had allowed her to give up the Anglican services. Hooper persuaded her to read in Hooker and Eusebius, and argued with the Prince, to the point of William saying \\"Well, Dr. Hooper, you will never be a bishop.\\" His daughter, Mrs. Prowse, however, reported that \\"in this station he was directed to regulate the Performance of Divine Chappel in Her Highness's Chappel, according to the usage of the Church of England, which he did in so prudent and decent a manner as to give no offence.\\" After about a year at The Hague, Hooper returned home to marry, then afterwards he returned to the Hague for eight months, when he was succeeded by Ken. In 1680 he was made chaplain to Charles II, and in the same year the Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford, vacant by the death of Richard Allestree, was offered to him: he declined it. In 1685 he was asked by James II to attend the Duke of Monmouth the evening before his execution, and on the following morning was on the scaffold with the Bishops of Ely and Bath and Wells and Dr. Tenison. At the Williamite Revolution he was one of the few decidedly High churchmen who took the oaths. In 1691, on the promotion of Dean Sharp to the archbishopric of York, Queen Mary offered him the deanery of Canterbury, taking advantage of the king's absence to promote her favourite: William, on his return, expressed displeasure at her conduct. In 1698 the Princess Anne and her husband Prince George of Denmark wanted Hooper as tutor to the young Duke of Gloucester, but the king imposed Gilbert Burnet. In 1701 Hooper was elected prolocutor to the lower house of the convocation of Canterbury, and defended its privileges of the lower house. About the same time he declined an offer of the primacy of Ireland made by the Earl of Rochester, as lord-lieutenant. Bishop Towards the close of 1702 he accepted the bishopric of St. Asaph. In 1703 the see of Bath and Wells fell vacant through the death of Richard Kidder. Queen Anne offered Hooper, but he felt that his non-juring friend Ken was the proper bishop of Bath and Wells. After negotiations, Hooper to filled the vacancy. Ken ceased signing himself \\"T. Bath and Wells\\", and dedicated his Hymnarium to Hooper. The queen ordered a pension of ¬£200 a year to be paid to Ken. Hooper was happy in the see of Bath and Wells, and refused translation, and a seat on the privy council. He was a frequent preacher before royalty. In the \\"church in danger\\" debate in the House of Lords in 1705 he maintained that the danger was not, as some supposed, imaginary; in 1706 he spoke against the union between England and Scotland, and advocated in the cause of the Scottish Episcopal church. In 1709‚Äì10 he defended Henry Sacheverell, and entered his protest against the vote in favour of his impeachment. Burnet, who had personal differences with Hooper in Convocation, describes him in 1701 in his History of His Own Time as \\"reserved, crafty, and ambitious\\". Other detractors of Hooper were Jacobites and nonjurors who were angry with Ken for resigning his canonical claims to Bath and Wells. Francis Atterbury also calle him ambitious; William Whiston, whom Hooper had rejected from holy communion, expressed a high opinion of his character. Family and later life Hooper married in 1678, a lady, Abigail Guildford, to whom he had been engaged before he left England for the Hague. He died, aged nearly eighty-seven, on 6 September 1727, at Barkley, near Frome, a secluded spot in his diocese to which he was wont to retire at intervals to recruit his strength. He survived his wife one year; and out of a family of nine children only one was living at the time of his death, the wife of John Prowse of Axbridge, who was author of an unpublished life of her father. Hooper was buried in Wells Cathedral, and a marble monument was erected to his memory.

It was one of the finest examples of Baroque architecture in The Netherlands. Today, only part of the outbuildings remain and are known locally as De Nederhof. History The village of Honselersdijk already had a small castle in the Middle Ages. In the 16th century it belonged to the princes of Arenberg, but they were on the Spanish side on the Eighty Years' War, and it was expropriated by the Province of Holland and put it at disposal of prince Maurice of Orange. His younger brother, prince Frederick Henry bought the castle in 1612 to use it as hunting lodge and summer mansion. It became his primary country house and showplace of his power. The medieval castle was torn down and was replaced between 1621 and 1647 by a new moated house and gardens inspired by the French architecture of the palais de Luxembourg, but with distinct Dutch features. After the death of his father, Prince William II completed the building of the house, although only a few of the planned extensions, such as galleries and pavilions, were created. Under William III and Mary the gardens were renovated and the house was adapted to the needs of its time (e.g. introduction of the sash window). The house was a rallying point for the various crossings to England or entrances to the city of The Hague. After the death of king-stadtholder William III the house was claimed by his cousin, king Frederick I in Prussia, just as various other country houses and palaces. The Prussian king and his family mostly lived in Berlin and because of an ongoing dispute about the inheritance with the King- Stadtholders sole heirs in the Frisian Nassau branch, little or no maintenance was taken up and the house fell into disrepair. Due to negotiations between Frederick II the Great and Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, the house was sold to her son prince William V in 1754. There were plans for renovation, but considered too expensive. William V occasionally used the house only for hunting purposes. The last real residents were his sister princess Carolina and her husband Karl Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg between 1760 and 1765. During the French occupation the House was confiscated in 1795 and fell into decay. It was used as prison and hospital. After the restoration in the Netherlands in 1813, king William I was not inspired to save the house and it was demolished in 1815. Currently, only part of the outbuildings remains, the ‚ÄòNederhof‚Äô (the lower courtyard), which was used as stables and guest quarters. Since its restoration in 1976, it is used as a foster home. Art and architecture Prince Frederick Henry and his wife princess Amalia of Solms-Braunfels introduced the classical architecture in the Netherlands by building various large country houses and gardens, such as Huis Honselaarsdijk, Huis ter Nieuwburg and Huis ten Bosch. These house were inspired on French and Italian architecture, such as the Palais du Luxembourg in Paris and the Versailles palace of king Louis XIII. With help of their secretary, Constantijn Huygens, Frederick Henry and Amalia selected architects Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post as their architects for the house. But they were also supported by several French artists such as the architect Simon de la Vall√©e and the gardener Andr√© Mollet. For the interior various artists were involved such as Gerard van Honthorst, Wybrand de Geest, Pieter de Grebber, Paulus Bor, Christiaen van Couwenbergh, Cornelis Vroom, Artus Quellinus the Elder. The House served as inspiration for the City Palace of Potsdam built by the son in law of prince Frederick Henry, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg.

Dance studies and first exposure to butoh Fleming studied ballet with Cecchetti method master Margaret Craske (1892‚Äì1990), and performed briefly with several New York City-based dance companies.

Lienau was born in Neustadt in Holstein and entered the publishing firm of Adolf Martin Schlesinger in Berlin in 1863. In the following year he acquired the firm, initially merely adding his own name to Schlesinger's.Judith Picard, \\"Lienau (Musikverlag)\\", in: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), biographical part vol. 11 (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 2004), cc.103‚Äì104. The firm Robert Lienau issued the works of leading composers such as Anton Bruckner, Jean Sibelius, Leopold Godowsky and Alban Berg. In 1875 he also acquired the Vienna-based publishing company Haslinger, originally founded by Tobias Haslinger, which also brought many works by Beethoven, Liszt, Spohr, Hummel, and Johann Strauss senior and junior into the business. Robert Lienau withdrew from the management of the company in 1898 (he died in 1920 in Berlin) and inherited it to his son Robert Heinrich Lienau (1866‚Äì1949), whose lobbying on the issue of musical copyright influenced the new copyright laws of the German Reich of 1901. From 1910 the company was managed by Robert Heinrich and his brother Friedrich Wilhelm Lienau (1876‚Äì1973), but they separated in 1938, with the younger brother taking over responsibility for the Haslinger business in Vienna and the elder remaining in Berlin.Picard, as above, c.104. Following the death of Hugo Bock in 1932, Lienau also took over Bote & Bock in 1935.Michael Kennedy, Joyce Bourne: \\"Bote & Bock\\", in: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music, p. 90 (2004).

Life Ryder's lifelong connection with John Henry Newman and the Oratory began as a private pupil, when he was about twelve years old. The only interruption was a year at the English College at Rome and a few months at the Catholic University, Dublin, of which Newman was rector, before he began in December, 1856, his Oratorian novitiate. In 1863 he was ordained priest. After Cardinal Newman's death he was elected superior of the Birmingham Oratory and held this office till his health gave way. He was the last survivor of \\"my dearest brothers of this House, the Priests of the Birmingham Oratory\\" to whom Newman dedicated his Apologia Pro Vita Sua. His grave is with theirs and Cardinal Newman's at Rednal, a small country house belonging to the Birmingham Oratory, about seven miles from Birmingham. His life was uneventful. He cared little for notoriety or even fame. Once only did he push himself forward. This was in 1867-8, when he attacked W. G. Ward, at that time editor of Dublin Review. His opinions on papal infallibility, according to Ryder, were a caricature, and he delivered his protest in three pamphlets. He was criticised for them. Works Apart from a number of articles in American and English magazines, he published: *\\"Idealism in Theology, a Review of Dr. Ward's scheme of Dogmatic Authority\\" (London, 1867); *\\"A letter to W. G. Ward on his theory of Infallible Instruction\\" (London, 1868); *\\"Postscriptum to Letter, etc.\\" (London, 1868); *\\"A critique upon Mr. Foulkes' Letter\\" (London, 1869); *\\"Catholic Controversy\\", a reply to Littledale's \\"Plain Reasons\\" (London, 1880); *\\"Poems Original and Translated\\" (Dublin, 1882). There is besides \\"Essays of the Rev. H. I. D. Ryder, edited by Francis Bacchus\\" (London, 1911). Family He was the eldest son of George Dudley Ryder, one of the numerous clergymen of the Church of England who followed in the steps of Newman, and Sophia Lucy, daughter of John Sargent. He was received into the Catholic Church at Rome in 1846. The grandfather, Henry Dudley Ryder, was a prominent Anglican Evangelical bishop. The three other Misses Sargent married Samuel Wilberforce, Henry Wilberforce, and Henry Edward Manning.

It was the first election to take place since responsible government without the towering presence of Premier Sir John Forrest, who had left state politics two months earlier to enter the first Federal parliament representing the Division of Swan, and the first state parliamentary election to follow the enactment of women's suffrage in 1899. The Ministerial group, led by Forrest's nominated successor George Throssell, ran a half-hearted campaign for government, with Throssell saying in a policy speech that while he would continue to serve as Premier if required, \\"it was not the class of political life he desired, as it interfered too much with his leisure.\\" Meanwhile, the Opposition had no clear leader, with the Parliamentary leader Frederick Illingworth and George Leake, who was seeking to return to Parliament in the election, both apparently contenders. The groups were neither formal nor organised, with many members and candidates professing rather confused allegiances and running their own campaigns on local issues. Following the introduction of payment of members in 1900, which effectively allowed electors without independent means to sit in Parliament, the Labour Party offered 22 candidates to the voters compared to three at the previous election, each of which was pledged to the party's platform. The Westralian Worker newspaper, launched six months earlier, was used to publicise the campaign. They ultimately won six seats, of which five were located in the Goldfields. No clear winner emerged, and considerable instability resulted as three Ministries either resigned or were defeated on a want of confidence motion. The situation was ultimately resolved when half of the Morgans Ministry were defeated in ministerial by-elections in December 1901, which gave the Opposition a narrow majority with Independent or Labour support. The election took place based on boundaries established in the Constitution Act Amendment Act 1899, which increased the number of members from 44 to 50 and reflected demographic changes‚Äîthe Pilbara region lost two seats as did the Murchison region, whilst five seats were created in Kalgoorlie and the Eastern Goldfields and four seats were created in the Perth metropolitan area. The election was conducted under the first past the post system, and electorates had a wide variety of numbers of enrolled voters, ranging from 108 at East Kimberley to 7,024 at Hannans‚Äînine electorates had 500 or less, whilst the same number had 3,000 or more. * Results } See also * Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 1897‚Äì1901 * Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 1901‚Äì1904 Notes : The total number of enrolled voters was 91,525, of whom 8,780 were registered in nine uncontested seats‚Äîfive of which were won by Ministerialists, three by Oppositionists and one by an Independent. The substantial rise in the number of voters from the 1897 election, where 23,318 voters were enrolled, reflected changes to eligibility criteria, including the enactment of women's suffrage, in the Constitution Act Amendment Act 1899. : Many supporters of the former Ministry, as argued by de Garis (Stannage, p.348), who eschewed party politics on principle but could be counted on to support the Ministerialist group, went to the election as Independents. This may partly explain the apparent disparity of votes to seats won in the election.

Prat Scenes) is an Israeli settlement organized as a community settlement in the West Bank. Located near Ma'ale Adumim, it falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. In 2006 there were around 90 families living in the settlement. In 2009 about 140 families lived there. Both religious and secular families live in Nofei Prat. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History The village was established in 1992 by a group of settlers from Jerusalem. It was named after the nearby Prat Stream. On the morning after the elections for the thirteenth Knesset and Israeli Labor Party victory and before transition of power was made, a mixed group of mostly single religious and non-religious students from the Hebrew University drove east from Jerusalem to a barren hilltop with a plan to create a mixed community. They erected a flimsy structure which would later that day be followed by twenty-seven trailers. Legal Status Nofei Prat is widely regarded by the international community as illegal under international law according to the Fourth Geneva Convention (article 49), which prohibits an occupying power transferring citizens from its own territory to occupied territory. Israel maintains that international conventions relating to occupied land do not apply to the West Bank because they were not under the legitimate sovereignty of any state in the first place. This view was rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory International Court of Justice, 9 July 2004. pp. 44‚Äì45 According to the ARIJ, Nofei Prat is located on land confiscated from the Palestinian town of 'Anata. 'Anata Town Profile, ARIJ, 2012 According to Geoffrey Aronson, Nofei Prat was established as a neighborhood of the settlement of Kfar Adumim in order to circumvent a promise to not construct new settlements. Transportation Nofei Prat was one of a number of settlements linked by a road secretly built by settlers in 1995. The road links Anatot to Kfar Adumim, Nofei Prat, and Alon. According to Pinhas Wallerstein, then head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, the road was one of a number of secretly built roads under construction in the area. Wallerstein claimed that as council head, he did not need permission to construct roads, but that he would stop construction if the Israel Defense Forces told him to. He also said \\"What are they going to do, tell us to take the road away? If the road is illegal let them take us to court.\\" Design The settlement's master plan and its first 33 houses were designed by Jerusalem architect Marcy Goldwasser.

History Opened by the Southern Region of British Railways in 1956, the station was served by Network SouthEast from the introduction of sectorisation until its closure. It was situated approximately from Lymington Town station near a bridge over the A337, and it was primarily intended for workers at the nearby Wellworthy factory.

However, as of June 2006 the new Lymington New Forest Hospital is being built on part of the old Wellworthy site, and the town of Lymington has also grown northwards to surround the location.

Blue: Wet Counties Yellow: Moist/Limited Counties Orange: Dry Counties (with a winery, golf course, or a qualified historic site) Red: Completely Dry Counties The alcohol laws of Kentucky, which govern the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in that state, lead to a confusing patchwork of counties that are dry, prohibiting all sale of alcoholic beverages; wet, permitting full retail sales under state license; and \\"moist\\", occupying a middle ground between the two. A justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court wrote in 1985 that the state's alcohol laws were a \\"maze of obscure statutory language\\" and \\"confusing at best.\\" The general counsel of the Kentucky Office of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) noted in 2012, \\"That's still the case.\\" This led Kentucky governor Steve Beshear to appoint a task force in summer 2012 to attempt to streamline the state's alcohol laws. Quirks Apart from the laws governing local option elections by which communities can determine whether alcoholic beverages can be sold at all, many aspects of the state's alcohol laws were called \\"perplexing\\" in a 2012 story in one of Kentucky's largest newspapers, the Lexington Herald- Leader. The confusion starts with licensing itself‚Äîthe state issues more than 70 different types of licenses for alcohol sales. One significant quirk is that wine can be purchased in a pharmacy, but not in a supermarket. The sale of wine and distilled spirits at pharmacies and grocery stores is regulated by laws that date to Prohibition. At the time, prescriptions for alcohol could be obtained at pharmacies (sometimes referred to as spirits of frumenti). After the end of national Prohibition, sales were prohibited in grocery stores because it was thought that minors were more likely to be in those businesses than in pharmacies. Today, while grocery stores can hold wine and distilled spirits licenses, they can only sell such beverages if they provide a separate entrance to that part of the store and not allow minors to work there. By contrast, grocery stores can sell beer in the main shopping area. Another inconsistency involves the difference between legal ages for buying and selling alcoholic beverages. The legal age for purchase is 21,Kentucky Revised Statutes ¬ß 244.080, where \\"minor\\" is defined in ¬ß 241.010 as an individual under 21. as in all U.S. states. However, the legal age for selling or serving alcoholic beverages in a licensed establishment is 20.KRS ¬ß 244.090 Wet and dry status The ABC uses very specific terminology to classify the state's 120 counties as \\"wet\\", \\"dry\\", \\"moist\\", or dry with special provisions. * Dry ‚Äî All sales of alcoholic beverages are prohibited. * Wet ‚Äî Sales of alcoholic beverages for on-site or off-site consumption are allowed in at least some areas outside of an incorporated city. However, many \\"wet\\" counties have dry precincts. Kentucky's two consolidated city-county governments, Louisville and Lexington, are both wet, although as noted below, a few precincts in Louisville are dry. * Moist ‚Äî The ABC uses this term strictly to refer to otherwise dry counties where one or more specific cities have voted to allow alcohol sales for off-premises consumption. * Limited ‚Äî A county in which at least some otherwise dry territory has approved the sale of alcohol by the drink at qualifying restaurants. Under this category, the ABC has secondary classifications of \\"Limited (100)\\" and \\"Limited (50)\\", with the numbers referring to the seating capacity required for a restaurant to apply for a license. * Golf Course ‚Äî A county in which at least some otherwise dry territory has approved the sale of alcohol by the drink at a qualifying golf course. * Winery ‚Äî A county in which at least some otherwise dry territory has approved the operation of a winery. * Qualified Historic Site (QHS) ‚Äî A county in which at least some otherwise dry territory has approved the sale of alcohol by the drink at a qualifying historic site. In popular usage, \\"moist\\" has a much broader meaning than the ABC's specific usage. In addition to the ABC definition, \\"moist\\" can also refer to a county where alcohol sales have been approved under any of the special provisions allowed by Kentucky law‚Äîin other words, any status other than \\"dry\\" or \\"wet\\". More often, the term is used to refer to otherwise dry cities or counties that have approved restaurant sales by the drink, as evidenced by a July 2012 editorial by The Independent of Ashland where the term \\"moist\\" is repeatedly used to describe several such locations. According to the last official ABC update of counties on January 3, 2013, 38 counties are dry, 32 are wet, and the remaining 50 are either \\"moist\\" or dry with special circumstances.  Possible definitions of \\"moist\\"  A county can be \\"moist\\", by popular definition, in several different ways: * Thirty-five cities in 30 counties are wet cities located in dry counties, bringing those counties under the ABC definition of \\"moist\\". Boyle County has three wet cities (Danville, Junction City, and Perryville), and Hardin and Hopkins Counties have three each. Knox and Whitley Counties share the same wet city, namely Corbin. The most recent cities to vote wet under this statute did so in successive weeks in the summer of 2012‚ÄîFranklin and Murray on July 17, La Grange on July 24, Georgetown on July 31, and Princeton on August 7. The first four of these cities had previously allowed sales by the drink in restaurants‚ÄîFranklin, Murray and Georgetown by city votes, and La Grange by a county-wide vote‚Äîwhile Princeton had been dry. The cities of Brodhead and Mount Vernon in Rockcastle County passed ballot initiatives allowing the sale of alcohol in November of 2018. Mayfield Kentucky * Two different statutes authorize local option elections, at either the county or city level, for sales of alcohol by the drink in restaurants: ** Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 242.185(6) requires that restaurants seat at least 100 patrons and derive at least 70% of their total sales from food to be allowed to serve alcohol by the drink. (For the purpose of determining whether a restaurant meets the 70% requirement, sales of non-alcoholic beverages are classified as \\"food\\".) The first city to approve sales under this statute was Murray in 2000; 27 other cities and three counties have since voted to approve such sales. One of these cities (Corbin) is also classified as \\"wet\\", having approved full retail sales in February 2012. In Oldham County, which allows such sales county-wide, its county seat of La Grange (as previously noted) voted itself fully wet in July 2012. A future \\"wet\\" vote does not affect the licenses of any restaurants that were approved for licenses under this statute; state officials confirmed this before Murray's 2012 \\"wet\\" vote. ** KRS 242.1244, enacted into law in June 2007, also requires that restaurants derive at least 70% of their total sales from food, but lowers the seating limit to 50 patrons. Restaurants licensed under this statute are not allowed to have separate bars, and can only serve alcohol to customers who purchase a meal, and only during a time frame that starts with the serving of the meal and ends 30 minutes after the customer finishes his or her meal. The first jurisdiction to approve sales under this statute was the city of Campbellsville; since then, five other cities, plus all of Henry County, have voted to allow sales under this law. Presumably, a future \\"wet\\" vote will also not affect the licenses of any restaurants approved for licenses under this specific statute. * Under KRS 242.123, an individual precinct within any dry territory‚Äîwhich can be a dry county, or a dry portion of an otherwise wet county‚Äîthat contains a USGA-regulation golf course may vote to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages by the drink on that specific course. As of January 2013, 26 golf courses in 15 different counties were approved for such sales at the local level, with two awaiting state approval. * KRS 243.155 allows individual precincts within dry territory to vote to allow a \\"small farm winery\\" to operate within the precinct. Once approved, a winery not only can produce and sell wine on its premises but also can apply for a license to sell wine and beer by the drink in a restaurant located on its premises. As of January 2013, 28 wineries in 20 different counties had been approved locally. Of these 28 locations, three were awaiting state licensure, and four had obtained licenses but later closed. KRS 243.154 allows a wholesale distributor of wine produced in small farm wineries to operate in dry territory. * KRS 242.1242, enacted into law in June 2007, allows precincts in dry territory that also house a \\"qualified historic site\\"‚Äîdefined in KRS 241.010(34) as either a site listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a National Historic Landmark, which also includes dining facilities for at least 50 patrons‚Äîto hold a local option election to allow sales of alcohol by the drink at qualified sites in that precinct. (When originally passed, the definition of a \\"qualified historic site\\" required that the location provide lodging, but that provision was removed in 2010.) The first such election was held in the North Burgin precinct of Mercer County on November 6, 2007, in which voters approved such sales at the Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill, the largest restored Shaker settlement in the U.S. Since then, two other locations have voted to allow sales under this statute, but both are awaiting state licensing. One of these two, Boone Tavern in Berea, faces an additional complication‚ÄîBerea College, the establishment's owner, has not yet determined whether it will apply for a license. *Finally, KRS 242.125 allows individual precincts in a city or county to vote dry in a wet city or county, and also allows dry precincts within an otherwise wet city or county to vote wet. An example of this law was in September 2007, when four precincts in Louisville's west end voted to end liquor sales as a deterrent to crime in the area. A more recent example occurred in August 2012, when three dry precincts in Sturgis, located in the wet Union County, held local option elections; one of the three precincts voted wet. Safety issues A study of about 39,000 alcohol-related traffic accidents in Kentucky found that residents of dry counties are more likely to be involved in such crashes, possibly because they have to drive farther from their homes to consume alcohol, thus increasing impaired driving exposure. The study concludes that county-level prohibition is not necessarily effective in improving highway safety.Schulte, G., et al.. Consideration of driver home county prohibition and alcohol-related vehicle crashes. Accident Analysis & Prevention, 2003, 35(5), 641-648.

History  The band was formed in 1998, by college classmates; Taka, Yasha and Hakua, as an Iron Maiden cover band. Their original female drummer is the one who named the band. Fellow student Seika soon joined and they felt having a vocalist who had never listened to heavy metal before would make their music more interesting. In 2000, Taia released a self-titled demo and the following year a second, entitled \\"Sanctus\\". The group eventually found its current sound with the arrival of a keyboardist. In 2002, Taia won a prize with their song \\"Beware\\". In the same year Fuuga replaced the old keyboardist, and the band released their first single \\"Sorrow\\". In 2004 they released their second single, \\"Yumegatari\\". That same year, Taia went on their first tour in Tohoku, while Higa joined as second guitarist. In February 2005, the band appeared on the Trendkill2005 compilation, and later in May on Total Steel Okinawa 2005. By the end of the year, on the 16th of November they released their first album, Asymmetry, which was followed by a tour in Okinawa, Tokyo and Osaka. Drummer Hakua was replaced by Ara in 2006. On July 19 they released the EP Prayer, which was accompanied with a DVD. In February and March 2007, the music videos for \\"Praise\\" and \\"Kazamai\\" were released, followed by their third album Seeds of Rain, on March 14. Soon after Taia began another tour. On September 9, 2009 they released their third album Through Your Tears in two versions; Japanese and English. Taia's song \\"Praise\\" was included on the January 15, 2011 compilation Iron Angel in preparation for their January 22 performance at the two-day Iron Angel Live event alongside other female metal acts such as Destrose and Dazzle Vision. Taia stopped all musical activities at the end of 2013. Taia reunited in 2017 to play at the fourth installment of the Okinawan Metal event \\"Balls of Steel\\" in support of their label-mates Soundwitch, who were also playing the event. They had initially only planned a one night reunion, but after the success of the show and with the re-emergence of the metal scene in Okinawa, they have continued to play through 2019.

The club started at second division level and competed with eighteen other teams at that level at the time. The club within two year of it existence set a record of playing 30 concurrent league matches without defeat at the Second Division. It was promoted to the First Division in the year 1999. At the Division One League, the club launched a campaign from the year 2000 to get qualification to the Premiership and was finally rewarded by the 2003. It came second in the league; hence, the club got promotion to the Premier Division. Due to capital intensive natures of the premier division, as the club was solely being financed by the Presided of the club, it was relegated after a year at the premiership. In the year 2004 the club changed its name from Stay Cool FC to Zaytuna FC, launched another campaign to the premiership and qualified again to the premiership 2006. The premiership home games were played at the El Wak Stadium. In order to overcome the financial challenges, the club entered into partnership with a local partner.

He founded in 1780 Paris's H√¥pital Cochin, as the hospice of Saint-Jacques du Haut Pas, in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques. Life His father, Claude-Denis Cochin (died 1786), was known as a botanist. Jean-Denis followed a course of theological studies in the Sorbonne and was graduated with the degree of Doctor. In 1755 he was ordained priest. The next year he was given charge of the parish of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. There he spent his whole life working for the material as well as the spiritual betterment of his people. He won great fame for his preaching. Cochin is noted especially for his philanthropy. The needs of his own parish suggested the foundation of a hospital. The idea, conceived in 1780, resulted in the completion of a building of which The Sisters of Charity took charge. The inscription on the building, Pauper clamavit et Dominus exaudivit eum, is an index of Cochin's intentions. He devoted his whole fortune to the work. The hospital was inaugurated with thirty-eight beds; today it is a large institution. It was originally called H√¥pital Saint- Jacques. In 1801 the General Council of the Paris hospitals gave it the name of its charitable founder, which it still preserves.

He competed in the Motocross World Championships from 1979 to 1988. Vimond is notable for being the first French competitor to win an FIM motocross world championship. In 2016, he was named an FIM Legend for his motorcycling achievements. Motocross career Vimond was born in Saint Tribehou, Manche, France. He made his motocross world championship debut in 1979 and competed in the 125cc class for the next four seasons riding a Yamaha but, was plagued by injuries and a sixth place in the 1982 125cc world championship would be his best result in the smaller class. In 1984, Vimond moved up to the 250cc motocross world championship still riding for Yamaha. He won his first Grand Prix race at the 1984 250cc Swiss Grand Prix and, finished the season ranked second to Heinz Kinigadner in the 250cc world championship. He won three Grand Prix races in 1985, including the last two races of the season to once again secure second place in the 250cc world championship, just 2 points behind Kinigadner. Vimond won seven out of twelve Grand Prix races in the 1986 season to claim the 250cc motocross world championship, becoming France's first-ever motocross world champion. Vimond was badly injured at a victory celebration in honor of his world championship. As he was being lowered by wires to the stage while astride his motorcycle, something went wrong and he fell almost nine meters, breaking his back. After recovering from his injuries, Vimond moved up to the premier 500cc motocross world championship in 1987. Although he won the 1988 Swiss 500cc Grand Prix and finished the 1988 season ranked 5th in the 500cc world championship, he was never able to perform at his previous performance level after his injury at his 1986 championship victory celebration. When Yamaha withdrew their motocross racing program in 1989, Vimond competed in the 500cc motocross world championship on a privateer Honda but, the machine was not competitive and he ended the season ranked 13th in the final standings. He returned to the 250cc motocross world championship in 1990 riding a Suzuki but, persistent injuries forced him to announce his retirement from competition.. After his retirement, Vimond became a motocross coach, helping young riders such as Sebastien Tortelli, Stephane Roncada, David Vuillemin and Romain Febvre.

Cobham RFC is based at the Old Surbitonians Memorial Ground in Cobham and is affiliated to the English RFU via the Surrey RFU. The club was founded in 1930 by the first leavers of the Surbiton County Grammar (now Esher College). They currently play in London 2 South West, following the club's relegation from London 1 South at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. History The club was formed in 1930 as Old Surbitonians RFC by the first group of school leavers from Surbiton County Grammar School for Boys. In 1949, as a memorial to those Old Boys who perished in World War II, the grounds at Fairmile Lane, Cobham, were purchased. After the school moved from its original site in Surbiton to Esher as a boys' grammar school, The Braemar Club was created to honour the old school building. The change of name of the school to Esher County Grammar School and more prominently the evolution of the old school into a mixed sixth form college had a significant and detrimental impact on the flow of young players into the Club, which was one of the driving forces behind the club being one of the first in the country to set up a Mini Rugby section, in the Golden Jubilee year of 1980. The club was placed in the first division of the new Surrey Leagues when the RFU introduced League Rugby in 1987. Prior to this, the club had enjoyed much success, including a famous unbeaten season of 1963‚Äì64, and a Surrey Cup Final appearance in 1976. The club changed its name in 1989 to Cobham Rugby Football Club, to both identify more closely with the immediate surrounding area, and to signify the change to an open membership club. Recent years have seen the clubs' steady progress through the leagues, with four promotions in six seasons in the Leagues since 1987, and success elsewhere in winning the Surrey Shield in 1999. The first team now play in London South following successive promotions. Despite its name change, it still recognises its heritage and association with the old school.Club History of Cobham Rugby Club During 2007 the club raised significant funds from within, alongside a legacy from a former player, Peter Marsh, which was Sportsmatched allowing the rebuilding of the clubhouse with a two-storey sports and social facility. It announced on 9 May 2011 the acquisition of rights to double the playing areas to six pitches by utilising the derelict golf driving range behind the local Fairmile Pub. The rugby club share the facilities with Cobham Tennis, Cobham Lacrosse and Cobham Netball. In 2015 Cobham RFC was one of only six rugby clubs to host international teams for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. In association with ACS International school Cobham and working closely with Elmbridge Borough Council the club hosted both Namibia and Italy, the only Team Base to host two international teams.

Shadow IT systems are an important source of innovation, and shadow systems may become prototypes for future central IT solutions. On the other hand, shadow IT solutions increase risks with organizational requirements for control, documentation, security, reliability, etc. Origins Information systems in large organizations can be a source of frustration for their users. In order to bypass perceived limitations of solutions provided by a centralized IT department, other departments may build up independent IT resources to suit their specific or urgent requirements. It isn't uncommon for resourceful departments to hire IT engineers and purchase or even develop software themselves, without knowledge, buy-in, or supervision from a centralized IT department. Implications In most organizations, the prevalence of shadow systems results in a heavily fragmented application landscape, where consistency, security and governability are sacrificed to achieve the necessary level of business agility, whether for the purpose of innovation or mere survival. Benefits The main benefit of shadow IT is the increased reactivity. The host department has direct power over its shadow IT resources, as opposed to central ones. Also, alignment between departments, a time- consuming and sometimes impossible task, is avoided. Shadow IT systems are an important source of innovation, and shadow systems may become prototypes for future central IT solutions. Incumbent IT management dealing with legacy infrastructure and data management challenges cannot easily provision data as a service, either because they are unaware of its advantages or cannot acquire the budget for its successful implementation. Against this background, neither can the IT department ever deliver against all business requirements at a low enough cost relative to a true DaaS IT department. These deficiencies lead the business to implement IT solutions that may be perceived to cost less to execute, albeit whilst introducing risks a formal IT project could avoid. For example, with the rise of powerful desktop CPUs, business subject matter experts can use shadow IT systems to extract and manipulate complex datasets without having to request work from the IT department. The challenge for IT is to recognize this activity and improve the technical control environment, or to guide the business in selecting enterprise-class data analysis tools. A further barrier to adopting DaaS is the legacy IT bulk provisioning of only the 'Read' element of the CRUD model (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This leads IT into neglecting the need to 'write back' into the original dataset, because this is complex to achieve. It is the need of shadow IT users to then store this changed data separately (I.E. 'siloeing') that results in a loss of organisational data integrity. Placing barriers to shadow IT can be the equivalent of improving organizational security. A study confirms that 35% of employees feel they need to work around a security measure or protocol to work efficiently. 63% send documents to their home e-mail address to continue work from home, even when they are aware that this is probably not allowed. Drawbacks Besides security risks, some of the implications of Shadow IT are:Raden, N., October 2005, Shadow IT: A Lesson for BI, BI Review Magazine, Data Management Review and SourceMedia, Inc. Myers, Noah and Starliper, Matthew W. and Summers, Scott L. and Wood, David A., The Impact of Shadow IT Systems on Perceived Information Credibility and Managerial Decision Making (March 8, 2016). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2334463 or https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2334463 * Wasted time Shadow IT adds hidden costs to organizations, consisting largely of non-IT workers in finance, marketing, HR, etc., who spend a significant amount of time discussing and re- checking the validity of certain data, setting up and managing systems and software without experience. * Inconsistent business logic If a ‚Äòshadow IT‚Äô spreadsheet application encapsulates its own definitions and calculations, it is likely that over time inconsistencies will arise from the accumulation of small differences from one version to another and from one group to another, as spreadsheets are often copied and modified. In addition, many errors that occur from either lack of understanding of the concepts or incorrect use of the spreadsheet frequently go undetected due to a lack of rigorous testing and version control. * Inconsistent approach Even when the definitions and formulas are correct, the methodology for doing analysis can be distorted by the arrangement and flow of linked spreadsheets, or the process itself can be wrong. * Wasted investment Shadow IT applications sometimes prevent full Return on investment (ROI) from investments in systems that are designed to perform the functions now replaced by Shadow IT. This is often seen in Data warehousing (DW) and Business informatics (BI) projects, which are initiated with good intentions, where the broader and consistent usage of DW and BI in the organization never really starts off. This can also be caused by management failure to anticipate deployment, licensing and system capacity costs when attempting to deliver DW & BI solutions. Adopting an internal cost model that forces potential new users of the DW/BI system to choose cheaper (shadow) alternatives, also plays a part in preventing successful enterprise implementation. * Inefficiencies Shadow IT can be a barrier to innovation by blocking the establishment of more efficient work processes. Additional performance bottlenecks and new single points of failure may be introduced when Shadow IT systems layer on top of existing systems. Data might be exported from a shared system to a spreadsheet to perform the critical tasks or analysis. * Higher risk of data loss or leaks Shadow IT data backup procedures may not be provided or audited. Personnel and contractors in Shadow IT operations may not be put through normal education, procedures or vetting processes. Originators of Shadow IT systems may leave the organization often leaving with proprietary data or leaving behind complicated systems the remainder of staff cannot manage. * Barrier to enhancement Shadow IT can act as a brake on the adoption of new technology. Because IT artifacts, e.g., spreadsheets, are deployed to fill critical needs, they must be replaced carefully. But lacking adequate documentation, controls and standards, that process is slow and error-prone. * Organizational dysfunction Shadow IT creates a dysfunctional environment leading to animosity between IT and non-IT related groups within an organization. Improper motivations behind Shadow IT efforts such as seeking job-security (i.e., \\"Bob is the only person with this data,\\" or \\"What will happen if he leaves?\\"), data hoarding, self-promotion, favor trading, etc. can lead to significant management issues. A 2015 survey of over 400 global Chief information officers (CIOs) showed 90% of CIOs worldwide find themselves by-passed by line of business at least sometimes. One third (31%) of CIOs globally are routinely side-lined when it comes to making IT purchasing decisions. * Compliance issues Shadow IT increases the likelihood of uncontrolled data flows, making it more difficult to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (USA) and many other compliance-centric initiatives, such as: Basel II (International Standards for Banking), GLBA (Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act), COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and related Technology), FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002), DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), NYDFS (New York Department of Financial Services) Prevalence Shadow IT is notoriously hard to measure. Within an organization, the amount of shadow IT activity is by definition unknown, especially since departments often hide their shadow IT activities as a preventive measure to ensure their ongoing operations. Even when figures are known, organizations typically don‚Äôt volunteer these. As a notable exception, The Boeing Company has published an experience report describing the alarming numbers of shadow applications which various departments have introduced to work around the limitations of their official information system. According to Gartner, by 2015, 35 percent of enterprise IT expenditures for most organizations will be managed outside the central IT department's budget. A 2012 French survey RESULTATS DE L‚ÄôENQUETE SUR LE PHENOMENE DU \\"SHADOW IT\\" par Thomas Chejfec : http://chejfec.com/2012/12/18/resultats-complets-de-lenquete- shadow-it/ of 129 IT managers revealed some examples of shadow IT : * Excel macro 19% * software 17% * cloud solutions 16% * ERP 12% * BI systems 9% * Websites 8% * hardware 6% * VoIP 5% * shadow IT support 5% * shadow IT project 3% * BYOD 3%. Examples Examples of these unofficial data flows include USB flash drives or other portable data storage devices, MSN Messenger or other online messaging software, Gmail or other online e-mail services, Google Docs or other online document sharing and Skype or other online VOIP software‚Äîand other less straightforward products: self-developed Access databases and self- developed Excel spreadsheets and macros. Security risks arise when data or applications move outside protected systems, networks, physical location, or security domains. Another form of shadow IT comes by way of OAuth connected applications, where a user authorizes access to a third-party application via a sanctioned application. For example, the user can use their Facebook credentials to log into Spotify or another 3rd party application via their corporate cloud app (Google G Suite or Microsoft Office 365). With this access, the 3rd party app may have excessive access to the sanctioned app, thereby introducing unintended risk.

In July 1939 he was sent to Stockholm to visit some distant relatives and after World War II he started to study and later on to work as a writer, critic and journalist. From 1960 until 1976 he was married to the Swedish pop artist Barbro √ñstlihn. Career In 1953 Fahlstr√∂m had his first solo exhibition, showing the drawing Opera, a room- sized felt-pen drawing. Also in 1953 he wrote H√§tila ragulpr p√• f√•tskliaben, a manifesto for concrete poetry, published in Swedish the following year and in English translation (by Mary Ellen Solt, in her anthology \\"Concrete Poetry. A world view\\") in 1968. In 1956 Fahlstr√∂m moved to Paris and lived there for three years before he moved to Front Street studio, New York City. In New York he worked with different artists and explored his role as an artist further. In 1962 he participated in the New Realists exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery, in New York City.

Fahlstr√∂m's work is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art Although some critics such as Frances Richard dismissed him as a \\"throwback to Surrealism or Agitprop at worst\\" other critics, such as Mary Flanagan have seen his use of games as constituting examples of critical play. Death He became a productive and well-known artist who worked in many genres, often dealing with political and social issues. On Swedish television he made a name for himself after he smoked a pipe that he claimed contained hashish during a national broadcast. In 1976 he died of cancer at the age of 48.
