Teaching and Research of HPI is focused on \\"IT-Systems Engineering\\". HPI was founded in 1998 and is the first, and as of 2018 the only entirely privately funded faculty in Germany. It is financed entirely through private funds donated by its founder, Prof. Dr. h.c. Hasso Plattner, who co-founded the largest European software company SAP SE, and is currently the chairman of SAP's supervisory board. Director and CEO of HPI is Prof. Dr. Christoph Meinel.  History  The HPI was founded in October 1998 as a public-private partnership. The private partner is the \\"Hasso Plattner Foundation for Software Systems Engineering\\", which is the administrative body responsible for the HPI and its only corporate member. The foundation‚Äôs legal status is that of a GmbH, a limited-liability company according to German law. As the public part of the partnership, the Bundesland Brandenburg provided the estate where several multi-storey buildings were built to form a nice campus. Hasso Plattner declared to provide at least 200 million Euros for the HPI within the first 20 years. He is also actively involved as a lecturer and head of the chair on Enterprise Platform and Integration Concepts, where the in-memory technology was developed. In 2004 he received his honorary professorship from the University of Potsdam. Teaching and Research The Bachelor and Master programs of the joint Digital Engineering Faculty of the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) and the University of Potsdam (UP) are characterized by their practically-oriented education and enables students to learn in small groups with the special supervision by professors.

It was released in 1986 for the Apple II, Commodore 64, and IBM PC compatibles. Gameplay The player controls a robot, for which they can select the color, and goes on a scavenger hunt. The game comes with set of cards, which are to be distributed to the other players. They determine which items they need to find before they get \\"home\\". The first player to find all their items indicated on the cards wins. The game includes facilities to swap cards with other players. Each turn, a player gets a pre-determined amount of fuel to do their scavenging. Each item is randomly placed on the map and it is up to the player to find that item, some which are even in bodies of water, such as a lake. Each time every player has gone through their respective turns, a special message displays telling the player what advantage they have that turn (e.g. faster movement, free teleports, etc.) or disadvantage (e.g. no new shields, no teleports, etc.). The player's robot can also find the items their opponents have in order to prevent them from winning the game. Opponents may also steal items from the player when they have no shields. There are no computer players in the game, so it must be played with other people. There are three levels of difficulty. The easy level results in all advantages coming up, the middle difficulty has some disadvantages with the advantages and robots can also get damaged (e.g. if it walks through the swamps or on the rocks). The difficult level has more disadvantages (such as no home), damages are more frequent and there are more options for robots (i.e. camouflaged color). Reception Bunten said of Robot Rascals: \\"the sales that EA was able to generate (despite a worthy marketing effort) were disappointing. It didn't have a solo-play option was everyone's rationale for the 'failure'. I can't argue with that but I also think the fact that it didn't have an identifiable 'genre' or audience certainly didn't help.\\"Dani Bunten Memorial page from World of M.U.L.E. Brian Moriarty said in his tribute to Dani Bunten: \\"[Robot Rascals] took the multiplayer option to a provocative new extreme. Not only did Robot Rascals have no single-player mode, it actually required the participation of no less than four human players. Daringly billed as a 'family game,' this peculiar fusion of turn-based action and strategy, augmented by a deck of real playing cards, received a polite but puzzled critical reception, and was carefully ignored by everybody else.\\" Info gave the Commodore 64 version four stars out of five, describing Robot Rascals as \\"a cute game\\" and approving of the graphics and sound. The magazine recommended it to families looking for a game to play together. Jasper Sylvester of Computer Gaming World praised Robot Rascals as \\"beautifully designed and packaged\\". The game's randomness, between the computer's events and the external deck of cards, were said to feel like a Looney Tunes cartoon. The considerable number of options and strategies available to each player were a highlight of the game, including alternate victory conditions on the Advanced level. The magazine's Charles Ardai stated that the game's \\"charming blend of strategy and luck makes this ... unusually enjoyable\\". Compute! favorably cited the distinctive personalities and appearances of the robots, and stated that \\"the whole family, including the three-year-olds, can play Robot Rascals\\".

The EAT has been a particularly useful screening tool to assess \\"eating disorder risk\\" in high school, college and other special risk samples such as athletes. Screening for eating disorders is based on the assumption that early identification can lead to earlier treatment, thereby reducing serious physical and psychological complications or even death. Furthermore, EAT has been extremely effective in screening for anorexia nervosa in many populations.Garner & Garfinkel, (1979) http://eat-26.com/Docs/Garner-EAT-40%201979.pdf The EAT-26 can be used in a non-clinical as well as a clinical setting not specifically focused on eating disorders. It can be administered in group or individual settings and is designed to be administered by mental health professionals, school counselors, coaches, camp counselors, and others with interest in gathering information to determine if an individual should be referred to a specialist for evaluation for an eating disorder. It is ideally suited for school settings, athletic programs, fitness centers, infertility clinics, pediatric practices, general practice settings, and outpatient psychiatric departments. It is designed for adolescents and adults. The EAT-26 is rated on a six-point scale based on how often the individual engages in specific behaviors. The questions may be answered: Always, Usually, Often, Sometimes, Rarely, and Never. Completing the EAT-26 yields a \\"referral index\\" based on three criteria: 1) the total score based on the answers to the EAT-26 questions; 2) answers to the behavioral questions related to eating symptoms and weight loss, and 3) the individual‚Äôs body mass index (BMI) calculated from their height and weight. Generally a referral is recommended if a respondent scores \\"positively\\" or meets the \\"cut off\\" scores or threshold on one or more criteria.  Development and History  The EAT was developed in response to a National Institute of Mental Health consensus panel that recognized a need for screening large populations to increase early identification of anorexia related symptoms. Additionally, the NIMH wanted a measure that could be used to examine the social and cultural factors involved in the development and maintenance of eating disordersGarner, D.M., & Garfinkel, P.E. (1980). Socio-cultural factors in the development of anorexia nervosa. Psychological Medicine, 10, 273-279. The original version of the EAT was published in 1979, with 40 items each rated on a 6-point likert scale.Garner, D.M., & Garfinkel, P.E. (1979).Psychological Medicine, 9, 273-279. In 1982, Garner and colleagues modified the original version to create an abbreviated 26-item test.Garner et al. (1982). The eating attitudes test: Psychometric features and clinical correlates. Psychological Medicine, 12, 871-878. The items were reduced after a factor analysis on the original 40-item data set revealed there to be only 26 independent items. Since that time, the EAT has been translated into many different languages and has gained widespread international as a tool to screen for eating disorders. Both the original paper and the subsequent 1982 publication are 3rd and 4th on the list of the 10 most cited articles in the history of the journal Psychological Medicine , a prominent peer-reviewed journal in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. The EAT-26 should be used as the first step in a two-stage screening process. Accordingly, individuals who score higher than a 20 should be referred to a qualified professional to determine if they meet the diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. The EAT-26 is not designed to make a diagnosis of an eating disorder and should not be used in place of a professional diagnosis or consultation. The EAT should only be used as a screener for general eating disorders, as research has not shown it to be a valid instrument in making specific diagnoses. Permission to use the EAT-40 or EAT-26 can be obtained from David Garner through the EAT-26 website . Instructions and scoring information can be obtained from the EAT-26 website for no charge. Limitations The EAT suffers from the same problems as other self-report inventories, in that scores can be easily exaggerated or minimized by the person completing them. Like all questionnaires, the way the instrument is administered can have an effect on the final score. If a patient is asked to fill out the form in front of other people in a clinical environment, for instance, social expectations have been shown to elicit a different response compared to administration via a postal survey. There are some general concerns with the EAT-26. First, varied symptoms of eating disorders and self- report instruments like the EAT measure symptoms only at that particular point in time. Therefore, considerable fluctuation is possible in some aspects of the eating disorder. Additionally, as it occurs with self-report measures generally, high scores on the EAT is typically influenced by a person's attitude. For example, a person might disclose less about their problems in order to be more socially desirable.Garfinkel, P. E., & Newman, A. (2013). The Eating Attitudes Test: Twenty five years later. Eating and Weight Disorders, 6(1), 1‚Äì21. The EAT has low positive predictive value because of denial and social desirability, as well as the possible confounding role of co-morbid factors.

In order to reconstruct this phase the Adaptive-Additive Algorithm (or AA algorithm), which derives from a group of adaptive (input-output) algorithms, can be used. The AA algorithm is an iterative algorithm that utilizes the Fourier Transform to calculate an unknown part of a propagating wave, normally the spatial frequency phase (k space). This can be done when given the phase‚Äôs known counterparts, usually an observed amplitude (position space) and an assumed starting amplitude (k space). To find the correct phase the algorithm uses error conversion, or the error between the desired and the theoretical intensities.

The avifauna of Yemen include a total of 432 species, of which thirteen are endemic, two have been introduced by humans and twenty-five are rare or accidental. Fourteen species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Yemen. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Yemen *(E) Endemic - a species endemic to Yemen *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Yemen as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Yemen although populations exist elsewhere *(X) Extinct -a species or subspecies that no longer exists Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus (Ex) **Arabian ostrich, Struthio camelus syriacus (X) Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds.

While its predecessor, Kong, is a Donkey Kong clone, Kong Strikes Back! is a clone of Mr. Do's Wild Ride with Donkey Kong-inspired graphics. Gameplay The player must rescue a damsel in distress on a rollercoaster in a fairground, and the goal of each level is to reach the top of the level to save her from Kong, a large ape. The player must avoid rollercoaster carts and various hazards by climbing up ladders on the track, and then climbing down and continuing up the track after the hazards pass. Development Kong Strikes Back!'s graphics are inspired by Donkey Kong, while its gameplay is a clone of Mr. Do's Wild Ride. Kong Strikes Back! was released in the EU in mid-November 1984, and TV advertisements for the game aired around Christmas 1985. To promote the release of Kong Strikes Back!, Ocean ran a caption contest in Home Computing Weekly, with the winners receiving a copy of either the Commodore 64 or the ZX Spectrum version of the game. Kong Strikes Back! appears on both the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 versions of the 1986 video game compilation Off the Hook, which donated all proceeds to the charity The Prince's Trust to help fight drug abuse. Kong Strikes Back! is one of the first games with music composed by Martin Galway. Reception Amstrad Action gave the Amstrad CPC version of Kong Strikes Back! an overall score of 83%, praising its \\"slick\\" graphics, \\"great\\" music, and \\"intense\\" action gameplay. Crash gave the ZX Spectrum version an overall score of 73%, criticizing the lack of a backstory for the game, further expressing that the game's graphics are \\"old fashioned\\" and \\"quite plain\\", particularly criticizing the damsel's \\"ugly\\" sprite. Crash praised the game's difficulty curve, as well as its \\"fast\\" movement and 'intuitive' controls, further calling Kong Strikes Back! \\"definitely above average\\". Sinclair Programs gave the ZX Spectrum version an overall score of 65%, praising its \\"addictive\\" gameplay as well as its difficulty, further calling Kong Strikes Back! a \\"well-thought out and immaculately constructed\\" game.

While initially four main shows were scheduled for this collective theatre company, repeat and spontaneous performances around the nation saw this number of live performances increased to over 10. This theatrical extravaganza was organised by the Nambassa Trust as part of its national promotion of the arts and towards promoting its 1979 three-day music, crafts and Alternative lifestyle festival, which was held in Waihi and attracted 70,000 people. Cast and crew ready to roll late October 1978 The Winter Show production had two parts. The Mahana rock opera, a live rock- theatre production made up of both MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ, combining traditional MƒÅori songs and dances with modern rock music, and depicting early white European colonisation of New Zealand and the impact this had on its local indigenous MƒÅori people. The second part was a high-energy theatre-rock production based on the old theme of cooperation versus competition. The \\"Return of the Ancients\\" told the story of the battle between \\"space angels\\" and \\"black magicians\\" for control of the planet earth. This visual creation was made up of actors, dancers and mime artists performing to a background of rock music, extravagant lighting with weird special effects, fire, bizarre costumes and giant masks. Background Return of the Ancients 1978. The Nambassa Winter show was coordinated on a voluntary basis by proud young unemployed kiwi hippies against a national backdrop of high unemployment in New Zealand. This era heralded the reformation of many social issues and cultural ideas, with youth (today's baby boomers), encouraging social revolution, while reshaping creativity and artistic direction away from the norm. This period in New Zealand also witnessed many young indigenous MƒÅori activists protesting for land rights and to have past land acquisitions recognised and recompensed. This was the roaring seventies and countercultural idealism was in full swing. The first 1978 Nambassa festival had been successful and some of the profits from this event were drafted into their Winter Show. To make this event a reality, the Nambassa core group, who were based in the country villages of Waihi and Waikino at the foot of the ecologically sensitive Coromandel Peninsula, temporarily moved to the city and hired the St John youth camp west of Auckland, from where this production was implemented. Professional and amateur actors, musicians and dancers, choreographers, seamstresses, chiefs, masseurs, prop designers, auto mechanics, various sound and lighting technicians, roadies and administrators (who doubled as actors) assembled at the St Johns camp where, over a period of two months, this production was created and rehearsed. This was a live-in workshop, as most participants in the Winter Show were encouraged to take up temporary residency at the camp; thus the Mother Centre was established. Many participating amateurs later carved out professional careers in the entertainment industry .- Mahana Rock opera Mahana The musical production of The Mahana rock opera was a colourful and perceptive view of early New Zealand life and began with the coming of the MƒÅori in canoes from the South West Pacific, their meeting on the high seas and subsequent voyaging to Aotearoa. It portrayed the arrival of the white man, his politics, his religion, early colonisation and the often negative transformation of the country dear to MƒÅoridom. The storyline and music climaxed as MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ do battle with each other, and continued with the eventual reconciliation of the two races. The rock opera employed many special effects, costumes, and some 20 actors, singers and musicians. Mahana's John Tucker, Bobby Simmons,Dale Whitcombe and John Cossar at Nambassa 1978. Mahana's John Tucker and Bobby Simmons on Nambassa Aerial Railway, January 1978 Mahana was formed in 1977 when a group of MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ friends who were mobile-truckers started jamming together. What they shared was a common bond. They were all mobile and lived with their families in a nomadic gypsy lifestyle in handcrafted house trucks and buses. They first came to notoriety when they performed on the Aerial Railway stage at the 1978 Nambassa three-day festival, becoming a huge hit. They called themselves \\"Mahana\\" in honour of a friend who loaned them his equipment to perform the 1978 festival. Within 24 hours and by popular acclaim they were headlining on the Nambassa main stage with a 20,000W PA in front of tens of thousands of people. After the Winter show Mahana performed at the Nambassa 1979 three-day festival in Waihi in front of 40,000 fans and again at the 1981 five-day celebration up Waitawheta valley. At Nambassa 1979 they formed their own self-contained gypsy encampment circle incorporating dozens of house-trucks and buses. This was the beginning of the Road-show Fayre era, and within their large magic circle enclosure, continuous entertainment and theatre was available for children and adults, organised and spontaneous. After the festival the Roadshow Fayre and Mahana continued their musically-founded gypsy lifestyle, touring from town to town entertaining people throughout the nation.Nambassa: A New Direction, edited by Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, A.

The Return of the Ancients Return of the Ancients Ogias implementing civilization collapse. The Return of the Ancients (1978) was a musical theatrical opera which presented a story told in the year 2975 by an old man from another dimension who recounted to the audience a strange and forgotten tale. He spoke of the legend of the lost planet earth, the evolution of humankind and the frail path humans have walked to find their destiny, encountering dark forces reincarnated as humans who sought to destroy culture and civilization. Utilizing best of 1970s visual technology using pulsating light beams, theatre, dance, mime, photo projections, fire, costume and rock music, the production portrays the age-old cosmic battles between the past and the future. The audience witnessed the seeming peace and tranquility at some point in evolution with live music from the legendary Rick Steele, Norma Leaf and Ted Chapman. But civilisation regressed, reflected by fast on- stage theatrics, heavy rock and explosions of special effects. Humans had to suffer captivity at the hands of the black magicians, ogias and demons that followed and obeyed the prince of darkness. Theatrically extravagant cosmic battles were fought live on stage as \\"Space Angels\\" dressed in multi-coloured rainbow cloaks descended from other planetary systems through two powerful beams of light, to do battle with the negative forces controlling and threatening the existence of planet Earth and its inhabitants. The return of the Ancients was written and produced by Peter Terry, Directed by Chris Cooper, Matthew Robinson and Grant Bridger.

New Zealand's Housetruckers of the 1970s New Zealand's Housetruckers of the 1970s. Housetruckers are individuals, families and groups who convert old trucks and school buses into mobile-homes and live in them, preferring an unattached and transient gypsy lifestyle to more conventional housing. These unique vehicles began appearing around New Zealand during the mid-1970s and even though there are fewer today they continue to adorn NZ roads.Nambassa: A New Direction, edited by Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, A.

Because it is not part of any Zone in Benishangul-Gumuz, it is considered a Special woreda, an administrative subdivision which is similar to an autonomous area. The southernmost woreda in the Region, Mao-Komo is bordered on the west by Sudan and South Sudan, on the north by the Asosa Zone, and on the east and south by the Oromia Region. Towns in this woreda include Tongo and it has a weekly market. Tongo refugee camp, housing 12,483 displaced people from Sudan and South Sudan, is also located in Mao-Komo., The UN Refugee Agency website The region and its inhabitants were described by the Dutch explorer Juan Maria Schuver, who travelled to the area in 1880-1883.Gerd Baumann, Douglas H. Johnson and Wendy James (editor), Juan Maria Schuver's Travels in North East Africa 1880-1883 (Hakluyt Society. Second Series, No 184), 1996. Demographics Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this woreda has a total population of 50,061, of whom 25,055 are men and 25,006 women. 3,392 or 6.78% of population are urban inhabitants. A total of 9,844 households were counted in this woreda, which results in an average of 5.08 persons to a household, and 9,503 housing units. The five largest ethnic groups reported in the Mao-Komo special woreda were the Oromo (35.1%), the Mao people (26.42%), the Berta (18.8%), the Kwama or Komo (14.46%), and the Fadashi (4.12%); all other ethnic groups made up 1.1% of the population. Main languages are Oromo (47.51%), Berta (17.47%), Mao (15.61%), Kwama (13.7%), and Fadashi (4.91%). The majority of the inhabitants were Muslim, with 94.56% of the population reporting that they held that belief, while 2.64% were Protestant, and 2.13% practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity.Census 2007 Tables: Benishangul-Gumuz Region , Tables 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4.

In 2003, Oprah Winfrey was the first guest on the Discovery Channel series Second Opinion with Dr. Oz, and, since 2004, Oz became a regular guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show, making more than sixty appearances. In 2009, The Dr. Oz Show, a daily television program focusing on medical issues and personal health, was launched by Winfrey's Harpo Productions and Sony Pictures Television. He is a proponent of alternative medicine, and has been criticized by physicians, government officials, and publications, including Popular Science and The New Yorker, for endorsing unproven products and non-scientific advice. The British Medical Journal published a study that found more than half of the recommendations on medical talk series including The Dr. Oz Show had either no evidence or contradicted medical research. Donald Trump's appointment of Oz to the Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition was criticized as an example of choosing \\"pundits over experts\\". Early life Oz was born in 1960 in Cleveland, Ohio, to Suna and Mustafa √ñz, who had emigrated from Konya Province, Turkey. Mustafa, born in Bozkƒ±r, a small town in southern Turkey, earned scholarships that allowed him to emigrate to the United States as a medical resident in 1955. Suna (n√©e Atabay), who comes from a wealthy Istanbul family, is the daughter of a pharmacist with Circassian (Shapsug) descent on her mother's side. Oz has two sisters, Seval √ñz and Nazlim √ñz. Oz grew up in a mixed Muslim environment where his father's family practiced more traditional Islam, while his mother's family were more secular Muslims. Oz was educated at Tower Hill School in Wilmington, Delaware. In 1982, he received his undergraduate degree in biology at Harvard University. He played safety on Harvard's football team and won an intramural college championship playing water polo. In 1986, he obtained MD and MBA degrees, respectively, at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Penn's Wharton School. He was awarded the Captain's Athletic Award for leadership in college and was class president and then student body president during medical school. Career Mehmet Oz at ServiceNation in 2008 Medical In 1996, Ottavio Alfieri proposed to Oz that the mitral valve only needed one suture to close a leak. He developed the idea to use a catheter to put one staple in and submitted the patent for MitraClip in 1997. In the late 1990s, Oz began recommending ventricular assist devices as an alternative for patients with heart failure. In 2010, Oz joined Jeff Arnold as co-founder of Sharecare, Inc. Oz has been a professor at the Department of Surgery at Columbia University since 2001. He directs the Cardiovascular Institute and Complementary Medicine Program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Television Oz appeared as a health expert on The Oprah Winfrey Show for five seasons. In 2009, Winfrey offered to produce a syndicated series hosted by him through her company, Harpo Productions. The Dr. Oz Show debuted September 14, 2009, distributed by Sony Pictures Television. On the show, Oz addressed issues like Type 2 diabetes and promoted resveratrol supplements, which he stated were anti- aging. His Transplant! television series won both a Freddie and a Silver Telly award. He served as medical director for Denzel Washington's John Q. In January 2011, Oz premiered as part of a weekly show on OWN called \\"Oprah's Allstars\\". In each episode, he, Suze Orman, and Dr. Phil answer various questions about life, health and finance. He also currently does a health segment on 1010 WINS titled \\"Your Daily Dose\\". On October 23, 2014, Surgeon Oz, showing Oz's career as a surgeon, debuted on OWN. During 2018-2019 the OzTalks show hosted Jordan Peterson on multiple occasions, totalling nearly six hours of in-depth interview & commentary. Writing Eight of Oz's books have been New York Times bestsellers, of which seven were co-authored by Michael F. Roizen. He has a regular column in Esquire magazine and O, The Oprah Magazine and his article \\"Retool, Reboot, and Rebuild\\" was awarded the 2009 National Magazine Award for Personal Service. Oz and the Hearst Corporation launched the bi-monthly magazine Dr. Oz THE GOOD LIFE on February 4, 2014. Controversies Oz was heavily criticised by Senator Claire McCaskill in a hearing on consumer fraud in diet product advertising. Oz's image and quotes have been exploited by many weight loss product scammers. While he himself has not been found to be involved in these scams, he has made statements that were exploited by scammers. During a Senate hearing on consumer protection, Senator Claire McCaskill stated that \\"the scientific community is almost monolithic against you\\" for airing segments on weight loss products that are later cited in advertisements, concluding that Oz plays a role, intentional or not, in perpetuating these scams, and that she is \\"concerned that you are melding medical advice, news, and entertainment in a way that harms consumers.\\" He has been a spokesman and advisor for the website RealAge.com, which The New York Times has criticized for its pharmaceutical marketing practices. In September 2016, during his presidential campaign, Donald Trump appeared on The Dr. Oz Show. In the lead-up to the show's taping, Oz promoted Trump's appearance with a claim that Oz would assess medical records submitted to the show by Trump and reveal his assessment on the show. Several news outlets speculated that Trump's appearance aimed to appeal to The Dr. Oz Shows large female viewership. In 2018, Trump appointed Oz, athletes, and The Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno to his Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. Trump's selections were criticized as choosing \\"pundits over experts\\" for the panel. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of media publications reported that Oz's discussion of the coronavirus on television was influencing Trump's decision-making after appearing on The Dr. Oz Show and promoting Oz to an advisory role. Oz had promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, as a cure for COVID-19 on multiple Fox News broadcasts in March 2020. Trump claimed to be taking the drug in May 2020. In June 2020, the Food and Drug Administration revoked emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine, stating that it was \\"no longer reasonable to believe\\" that the drug was effective against COVID-19 or that its benefits outweighed \\"known and potential risks\\". In April 2020, Oz appeared on Fox News with Sean Hannity and stated that reopening schools in the United States might be worth the increased number of deaths it could potentially cause. He received major backlash on social media for the comments and later apologized claiming that he had seen the argument in an editorial on The Lancet. Viewpoints=Criticism Oz has faced criticism due to his tendency to promote pseudoscience. He has been supportive of homeopathy, and is a proponent of alternative medicine. Popular Science and The New Yorker have published critical articles on Oz for giving \\"non-scientific\\" advice. A 2014 study published in the British Medical Journal found that medical talk shows such as The Dr Oz Show and The Doctors often lack adequate information on the specific benefits or evidence of their claims. 40 episodes of each program from early 2013 were evaluated, determining that evidence supported 46 percent, contradicted 15 percent and was not found for 39 percent of the recommendations on The Dr Oz Show. In April 2015, a group of ten physicians from prestigious institutions called for Columbia University to part ways with Oz, who was the vice chair of the Department of Surgery. More than 1,300 doctors signed a letter sent to the university. Oz has been awarded the James Randi Educational Foundation's Pigasus Award from 2009 to 2012 for his promotion of energy therapies, support of faith healing, psychic communication with the dead and \\"quack medical practices, paranormal belief, and pseudoscience\\". Medical marijuana Oz denounced the \\"hypocrisy\\" in the Drug Enforcement Administration's classification of cannabis as a Schedule I, controlled substance on Fox & Friends. He has advocated for medical marijuana as a solution for the opioid epidemic during an episode of the series featuring Montel Williams. Diet Oz has spoken in favor of the disputed practice of intermittent fasting. He became involved in a feud with actor Mark Wahlberg over not eating breakfast and took part in a push-up challenge with Wahlberg winning. Personal life Oz and his wife Lisa Oz lives in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, with his wife Lisa. They have been married since 1985Married on July 29, 1985 in Bryn Athyn, PA ‚Äì New Church Life, 1985, p. 430. and have four children and four grandchildren. His eldest daughter is author and television host Daphne Oz. Oz and his wife founded HealthCorps, a non-profit organization for health education and peer mentoring. Oz is fluent in English and Turkish. He is a holder of Turkish and American citizenship, having served in the Turkish Army to retain his Turkish citizenship. Oz identifies himself as a Muslim and says that he has been influenced by the mysticism of Sufi- Muslims from central Turkey, as well as the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg, the 18th-century Swedish theologian. Oz is a practitioner of transcendental meditation. \\"When I meditate, I go to that place where truth lives,\\" he said. \\"I can see what reality really is, and it is so much easier to form good relationships then.\\" In August 2010, Oz was diagnosed with a pre-cancerous polyp in the colon during a routine colonoscopy which was performed as part of his show. Oz said that the procedure likely saved his life. In 2019, Oz played for the \\"Home\\" roster during the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game at the Bojangles' Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina. The roster was made up of celebrities with Carolina roots. He previously played in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game. Also in 2019, Oz played for Team Cleveland in Major League Baseball's All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game at Progressive Field in Cleveland. Recognition From 1999 to 2004, Oz was named a \\"Global Leader of Tomorrow\\" by the World Economic Forum and was listed on Time Magazine's \\"100 Most Influential People\\" of 2008. He has been nominated for nine Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Talk Show Host since The Dr. Oz Show premiered in 2009, and won the award in 2010, 2011, 2014 and 2016.

The route runs from DE 2 and the southern terminus of DE 41 in Prices Corner east to a dead end near Newport; however, DE 62 signage ends at the DE 4 intersection. The road runs through suburban areas along Newport Gap Pike and Boxwood Road, meeting DE 141 at an interchange. The Newport Gap Pike portion of road was built as a state highway by 1925 and became part of DE 41 by 1936. Boxwood Road was improved in 1946. DE 62 was assigned to its current alignment by 1981. Route description DE 62 westbound approaching its terminus at DE 2 and DE 41 in Prices Corner DE 62 heads southeast from DE 2 (Kirkwood Highway) on the Newport Gap Pike, a two-lane undivided road. Newport Gap Pike continues northwest past this intersection as DE 41\\\\. The road intersects Old Capitol Trail and heads through suburban residential and commercial developments, crossing the Wilmington and Western Railroad and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line at-grade. DE 62 passes more development and reaches the community of Belvedere, where it comes to a ramp from southbound DE 141. At this point, the route turns east onto Boxwood Road, a four-lane divided highway, with Newport Gap Pike continuing south to provide access to southbound DE 141\\\\. DE 62 passes over the DE 141 freeway and intersects Centerville Road, which provides access to and from northbound DE 141\\\\. Past this intersection, the road becomes two lanes and undivided, passing to the south of the former Wilmington Assembly plant used by General Motors and to the north of residential subdivisions. DE 62 continues through more residential neighborhoods, passing to the north of the Conrad Schools of Science, and reaches an intersection with DE 4, where DE 62 signage ends. The route officially continues east on Middleboro Road through more neighborhoods, intersecting Dupont Road before coming to a dead end. DE 62 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 23,750 vehicles at the intersection of Newport Gap Pike and Boxwood Road to a low of 283 vehicles at the eastern terminus. None of DE 62 is part of the National Highway System. History DE 62 running west from DE 4 near Newport What is now the Newport Gap Pike portion of DE 62 was originally chartered as the Gap and Newport Turnpike in 1808, an extension of the 1807-chartered turnpike in Pennsylvania that was to run from Gap, Pennsylvania, southeast to Newport, Delaware. By 1920, what is now DE 62 existed as a county road. The Newport Gap Pike portion of the route became a state highway by 1925. This state highway became a part of DE 41 by 1936, when Delaware designated its state highways. In 1946, Boxwood Road was improved to provide access to the new General Motors plant along the road. By 1981, DE 62 was designated onto its current alignment, with the Newport Gap Pike section replacing a portion of DE 41.

The avifauna of Bahrain include a total of 333 species, of which four have been introduced by humans, and seventy-six are rare or accidental. Two species listed are extirpated in Bahrain and are not included in the species count. Six species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Bahrain. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Bahrain * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Bahrain as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions * (Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Bahrain although populations exist elsewhere Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds.

He is mostly remembered for his lengthy spell with S.S.C. Napoli, where he served as the club's captain and contributed to the team's first ever Serie A title in 1987. Throughout his career, he was referred to as \\"Pal e fierr\\" (\\"iron pole\\") by the fans, due to his physical strength. Career Born in Sassano, Campania, Bruscolotti began his career with Sorrento in 1970. He immediately helped the club to Serie B promotion, winning the Serie C1 title during the 1970‚Äì71 season, and was a part of a defence which only conceded 12 goals in the league; the following season, however, the club were immediately relegated to Serie C once again, after finishing in second-last place in the league. Bruscolotti subsequently moved to S.S.C. Napoli in 1972, where he spent most of his career, making over 500 appearances for the team during his sixteen seasons in Naples; he made his Serie A debut with Napoli during the 1972‚Äì73 season, in a 1‚Äì0 win over Ternana on 24 September 1972. Bruscolotti became a symbol and a legend of the club, and played a key role in helping Napoli to their first ever Serie A title in 1987; he was also the team's captain from 1978 until 1984, when he handed over the armband to Diego Maradona. He retired at the age of 37 in 1988; he holds the record for most Serie A appearances for Napoli (387), and has made the second most appearances in all league competitions for the club. He also made 96 appearances for Napoli in the Coppa Italia, and 28 in European competitions. Bruscolotti also scored 11 goals for Napoli throughout his career; one of his most notable goals came in a 1‚Äì0 home victory over Anderlecht in the return leg of the 1976‚Äì77 European Cup Winners' Cup semi- finals, although Napoli were eliminated by the eventual champions on aggregate. His most important goal for the club came in the second leg of the 1976 Anglo-Italian League Cup final, which saw Napoli triumph over Southampton. In addition to these titles, Bruscolotti also won two Coppa Italia titles with Napoli. Style of play A tenacious, imposing, and powerful full-back, Bruscolotti was known in particular for his physical strength and balance, as well as his excellent man-marking ability, leadership, and his hard-tackling style of play. Although he was notorious for his aggressive challenges, he was also praised throughout his career for his fair-play attitude.

The avifauna of Iraq include a total of 415 species, of which two have been introduced by humans and thirteen are rare or accidental. One species listed is extirpated in Iraq and is not included in the species count. Fourteen species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Iraq. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories.

Ordered by the Ministry of Defence, it was specifically designed for the upcoming Challenge 1934 International Touring Aircraft Contest. Design and development The PZL.26 was a development of the PZL.19, that was built for previous Challenge 1932 contest. Like its predecessor, it was designed by Jerzy DƒÖbrowski and Franciszek Misztal in 1933. The plane was an all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane with a fixed landing gear and a closed canopy. It retained wings and tail of the PZL.19, with minor changes. A fuselage, wings and landing gear were more streamlined and strengthened. The main change was a stronger engine, a US-made 265 hp Menasco Buccaneer B-6S3 engine. The engine choice appeared to be a failure, though. Five aircraft were built in 1934 and one prototype for static trials. They carried registration markings: SP-PZL to PZP. Operational history All five PZL.26s took part in the Challenge from August 28 to September 16, 1934. A 9538 km long rally over Europe appeared too difficult for engines, and three aircraft failed to finish the rally due to engine breakdowns (pilots: Szczepan Grzeszczyk, Andrzej W≈Çodarkiewicz and Jan Balcer). Piotr Dudzi≈Ñski (SP-PZL) took the 11th place and Ignacy Giedgowd (SP-PZM) the 17th place (by coincidence, these results were similar to those of PZL.19s, two years earlier). Giedgowd's engine failed during a maximum speed trial, though. It is noteworthy, that they had the 2nd and 4th results of average speed in the rally - 211 and 213 km/h. In Autumn 1934, the PZL.26 SP-PZM was presented at the Paris Air Show. Because of unreliable engines and quite big fuel consumption resulting from their high power output, most PZL.26s were not used in Polish sports aviation much after the Challenge. SP-PZL, -PZM, -PZN and - PZP were removed from the registry on July 1, 1936. The SP-PZO was used until the war in 1939 by the Pomeranian Aeroclub in Toru≈Ñ. Possibly also the other one was used in this Aeroclub. In 1939 Jerzy DƒÖbrowski made a preliminary design of a fast fighter plane PZL.55, being a far development of the PZL.26's construction, powered by Hispano-Suiza 1100 hp engine, but it was not realized due to World War II. Description Metal construction low-wing monoplane, conventional in layout. Fuselage of a steel frame covered with duralumin in front and canvas in the rear. Trapezoid three-part wing with elliptical ends, covered with duralumin. Wings were fitted with automatic slats and split flaps. Wings were folding rearwards. Cab had three seats in tandem, under a common multi-part canopy, with double controls for the first two crewmen. Fixed landing gear with a rear skid, main wheels in massive aerodynamical covers. Two-blade metal propeller. Fuel tanks in wings and smaller one in the fuselage (180 l). Cruise fuel consumption 60 l/h.

The avifauna of Armenia include a total of 376 species This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2019 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Armenia. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Armenia * (Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Armenia although populations exist elsewhere Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. *Graylag goose, Anser anser *Greater white-fronted goose, Anser albifrons *Lesser white-fronted goose, Anser erythropus *Red-breasted goose, Branta ruficollis *Mute swan, Cygnus olor *Tundra swan, Cygnus columbianus *Whooper swan, Cygnus cygnus *Ruddy shelduck, Tadorna ferruginea *Common shelduck, Tadorna tadorna *Garganey, Spatula querquedula *Northern shoveler, Spatula clypeata *Gadwall, Mareca strepera *Eurasian wigeon, Mareca penelope *Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos *Northern pintail, Anas acuta *Green-winged teal, Anas crecca *Marbled teal, Marmaronetta angustirostris *Red-crested pochard, Netta rufina *Common pochard, Aythya ferina *Ferruginous duck, Aythya nyroca *Tufted duck, Aythya fuligula *Greater scaup, Aythya marila *Velvet scoter, Melanitta fusca (Ex) *Common scoter, Melanitta nigra (A) *Long-tailed duck, Clangula hyemalis (A) *Common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula *Smew, Mergellus albellus *Common merganser, Mergus merganser *Red-breasted merganser, Mergus serrator *White-headed duck, Oxyura leucocephala Pheasants, grouse, and allies Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae The Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds.

Mission statement \\"Inspiring curiosity, engaging the community, sharing knowledge\\".\\" History Whitchurch-Stouffville Public Library at its current location The Whitchurch‚ÄìStouffville Public Library traces its heritage to 1877 when it was first established in Allan's Jewellery Store. A key promoter was J. Wideman, the editor of the local newspaper, the Alert. The library was known as the Mechanics' Institute, and for a time was located in the old Municipal Building (today The Lebovic Centre for Arts & Entertainment ‚Äì Nineteen on the Park). It held 793 volumes in the early 1880s, 1009 volumes in 1884, and more than 2,500 in 1895. Stouffville's 1923 \\"Carnegie\\" Library It became a free public library in 1899. The first permanent library was built in 1923 at 7 Main Street East, through a $6000 grant from the Carnegie Foundation and the generosity of many local donors. The Carnegie Library could hold between 5,000 and 7,000 volumes; in 1923 it had 5,495 volumes; in 1947, 7,246 volumes; and in 1964 approximately 5,000 volumes (the town's population in 1923 was under 2000; at amalgamation in 1971, Stouffville proper had a population of 5,036). The Library moved to a storefront in 1974 and then to a $360,000 new building at 6240 Main Street in 1977. The library celebrated its 100th birthday on February 17, 1999. The Whitchurch-Stouffville Leisure Centre was constructed in 2001 at 2 Park Drive, a facility now occupied jointly by the department of Leisure Services and the library. Whitchurch-Stouffville Public Library Building, 1977-2001 The population of Whitchurch-Stouffville grew 87.5% between 2006 and 2015, from 24,390 residents to approximately 45,000. Correspondingly, the library's annual circulation also increased, from 104,998 items in 2005 to 245,200 in 2014. Library funding as a percentage of the town operating budget declined from 5.1% in 2004 to 3.0% in 2007, and to 2% in 2011. Total expenditure increased from about $770,000 in 2004 to about $1,000,000 in 2011. A consultants' report on Ontario municipalities prepared in 2010 ranked Whitchurch-Stouffville ninth of eleven Ontario communities in its population category for per capita library spending (based on 2009 data). By 2011, Whitchurch-Stouffville's per capita library costs were $23, the lowest of sixteen Ontario towns in its population category (average $44).see BMA Municipal Study 2011, 152. In the same year (2011), the library found it necessary to cover basic library operating costs from the proceeds from its annual community book sale. The library will serve a projected a town population of 42,343 in 2013; 53,321 in 2021; and 62,321 in 2026.In 2006, the Whitchurch-Stouffville hamlet of Ballantrae was identified by Statistics Canada as the fastest growing area in all of Canada. ). In June 2011, local book clubs and individuals began a grass-roots campaign to petition for greater municipal funding for the public library. An expansion of the library facility was planned, but continually postponed; the town's 2009 capital budget called for the design work in 2011 and the construction in 2010, the 2010 budget for design work in 2013 and construction in 2014, the 2011 budget for design in 2014 and construction in 2015. After over a year of construction, the library expansion opened on April 16, 2018.

The cassette tape release for the Commodore 64 is the first game to use the Novaload fast loader. Gameplay In this game the player controls an archer, armed with a bow and a limit of four quivers of arrows per level. The aim is to move through a forest setting while eliminating various monsters, including giant spiders, bees, mutated frogs, dragons, wizards and snakes, with the final enemy being the Demogorgon. The monsters were inspired by the films Night Of The Demon, Jason And The Argonauts and Mysterious Island. The game has four levels of difficulty (Innocent, Trooper, Daredevil and Crazy) which determine the number and speed of the monsters. This is one of the earliest video games to use animated blood. It also features parallax scrolling and a day/night cycle.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zQ3VAAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA10&lpg;=PA10&dq;=Day+night+cycle+forbidden+forest&source;=bl&ots;=IWXVpEodmF&sig;=ACfU3U002tHDkIIlwvtAaFoiAryxPAUW-g&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwi_gJTl7YbqAhXKPsAKHaMzDRMQ6AEwAXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q;=Day%20night%20cycle%20forbidden%20forest&f;=false Development Paul Norman began working for a small company named Synchro. It was a small software store creating Apple II, VIC-20 and Commodore 64 software. Paul rented a vehicle and drove the 30 miles to apply for an advertised position with a game he had created for the VIC-20. Paul landed the position and began working on Forbidden Forest as a way of learning 6502 programming. The company that he was working for was going out of business and representatives from the software company Cosmi arrived to purchase office furniture. They saw Paul working on Forbidden Forest and hired him on the spot. Reception The game was positively received by the reviewer of Your Commodore who gave it a score of 4/5, saying that it was \\"among my top five favourites\\". Although the graphics were not \\"totally first class\\" the game was said to be \\"amazing.\\"https://archive.org/stream/02-your-commodore- magazine/Your_Commodore_Issue_02_1984_Nov#page/n31/mode/2up In the first issue of Zzap!64 the game was placed 21st in a list of the top 64 games list.

It was given an overall score of 82%.http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi- bin/displaypage.pl?issue=030&page=110&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap&check=1 Legacy A sequel, Beyond the Forbidden Forest, was released in 1985. This was billed as \\"OmniDimension 4D\\", as the game is a third-person shooter that allows the archer to move (and shoot) in and out of the foreground, with scenery changing from day to night in order to represent time passing. Again, the object is to eliminate monsters (giant scorpions, worms and mosquitos etc.) while wandering the forest, earning a golden arrow for each kill; after earning four arrows, the archer may enter the underworld to face bats, a Hydra and finally the Demogorgon itself.https://archive.org/stream/zzap64-magazine-018/ZZap_64_Issue_018_1986_Oct#page/n15/mode/2up A further sequel, Forbidden Forest (informally, Forbidden Forest 3), was released for Microsoft Windows in 2003, co-developed with Webfoot Technologies. This is a 3D adventure in which the aim is to explore an environment while searching for coins, collecting power-ups and facing recreations of villains from the first game.

The route runs from DE 4 adjacent to the Christiana Hospital in Christiana southeast to DE 273 near Hares Corner. The road passes through suburban areas between Wilmington and Newark, intersecting DE 1/DE 7 and Interstate 95 (I-95) in Christiana and DE 37 near the Wilmington Airport. Churchmans Road was originally a county road that was paved in the 1930s and realigned twice in the 1950s. DE 58 was designated onto it in the 1980s. Route description DE 58 westbound at DE 1/DE 7 in Christiana DE 58 begins at an intersection with DE 4 in Christiana. Past this intersection, the road continues northwest as Delaware Park Boulevard to provide access to Delaware Park ‚Äì which consists of a thoroughbred horse racetrack, casino, and golf course ‚Äì and the Churchmans Crossing station on SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line that runs along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. From DE 4, DE 58 heads east on Churchmans Road, a four-lane divided highway. The route passes to the north of Christiana Hospital and runs through commercial development before coming to an interchange with DE 1/DE 7; the northern terminus of DE 1 is at this interchange. Just east of that interchange, DE 58 forms the southern border of the Stanton Campus of Delaware Technical Community College. The route crosses over I-95 (Delaware Turnpike), where there is a ramp from I-95 southbound to DE 58\\\\. This is the only direct ramp between DE 58 and I-95, as all other access between the two routes must be made via DE 1/DE 7. Past I-95, DE 58 becomes a two-lane undivided road and heads to the southeast through residential areas, crossing the Christina River. The route curves south through commercial development, widening back into a four-lane divided highway and intersecting DE 37\\\\. Past the intersection with DE 37, DE 58 continues southeast as a two-lane undivided road and skirts the southwestern edge of Wilmington Airport. The route passes through light industrial development and continues to its terminus at DE 273 near Hares Corner. DE 58 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 26,430 vehicles at the DE 1/DE 7 interchange to a low of 10,203 vehicles at the DE 37 intersection. None of DE 58 is part of the National Highway System. History DE 58 westbound past DE 37 near New Castle Churchmans Road existed as a county road by 1920. The entire road was paved by 1936. Churchmans Road originally ran from DE 4 near Christiana to U.S. Route 13 north of Hares Corner. By 1952, the current alignment of Churchmans Road was constructed around the west side of Wilmington Airport from north of Airport Road to DE 273 near Hares Corner, with a portion of the original road southeast of Airport Road being removed; the two pieces of the former alignment that remained are now Old Churchmans Road. The current alignment of Churchmans Road west of DE 7 was built two years later, with the former alignment now Old Churchmans Road. DE 58 was designated onto its current alignment in 1985. In 1999, the intersection at DE 7 was converted into an interchange in a $25 million construction project. In 2003, construction began on a new bridge carrying DE 58 over I-95 to replace the previous bridge, which was over 40 years old and experienced deterioration. Construction of the new bridge, which cost $17 million, was originally planned to be finished in fall 2005 but completion was delayed to fall 2006. The new bridge carrying DE 58 over I-95 was built to accommodate future widening of I-95. Between May 2005 and June 2006, the portion of DE 58 at the intersection with DE 37 was reconstructed and widened into a divided highway as part of a $8.6 million project that also reconstructed and widened DE 37 along Airport Road between DE 58 and Commons Boulevard.

It was originally filmed at Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida and was the last comedy show to be filmed there before being later moved over to the Nickelodeon on Sunset in Hollywood for its second season. The series only lasted for two seasons before being cancelled in 2002 due in part to increasing production costs. Premise Taina Morales is a young Latina teenage girl who aspires to be a singer and actress. She, along with her best friend, Renee Jones, attend the Manhattan High School of the Performing Arts. Once there, they reunite with Lamar, whom neither has seen since elementary school. Taina and Renee's nemesis, Maritza Hogg (who knew Taina and Renee before high school) attends the same school they do, and is also an aspiring singer/actress. Every episode features Taina daydreaming of eventual super stardom, with occasional performances of a new song. Cast and characters=Main * Christina Vidal as Taina. Taina Maria Morales is a young, beautiful and talented Latina with hopes of being a professional singer and actress. She attended a performing arts school with her best friend Renee, rival Maritza, and friends Daniel and Lamar. She and her friends often got themselves into wacky situations in an attempt to become stars. Though Taina's impatience and impulsiveness would occasionally get her into scraps, she always let her honesty and compassion get her out of it. The name Taina is the female form of the name of the indigenous people of Puerto Rico, the Tainos. * Khaliah Adams as Renee. Renee Aretha Jones is Taina's best friend. She is an aspiring comedian and rapper. A crazy girl, she attended the performing arts school to become a comedian and a rapper. She often helped to ground Taina when her imagination ran away with her. Renee also tended to chase after boys frequently; unfortunately, her love interests were never the right ones for her. * Chris Knowings as Lamar. Lamar Carlos Johnson is Taina's passionate guy friend and an aspiring director and writer. Not only did he serve as an editor of the performing art school's newspaper, he also had a crush on Taina and waited for the day she would finally come around. His best friend was Daniel, and the two often join forces to make a quick buck. He served as a support for Taina and the others, offering level-headed advice. * David Oliver Cohen as Daniel. Daniel Nathaniel McDaniel is a multi-instrumentalist, who also shares the same school locker with Taina. Sweet and opinionated, his loves included writing songs, playing different instruments and chasing after girls. Daniel prided himself on being quite the ladies' man, but often ended up snubbed. It was hinted that he had true feelings for Renee. He loves The Beatles, and usually accompanied Taina's songs on his guitar. * LaTangela as Maritza. Maritza Hogg is Taina and Renee's rival. She also aspired to be an actress and singer, but tended to be more ruthless than Taina. She loved to upstage others in her quest to become a star. However, she was not pure evil, and sometimes collaborated with Taina and her friends to make money or defeat other rivals. She prided herself on being an \\"evil diva\\".

The pilot was partially shot at the Laguardia Performers School in 1999 and finished at Nickelodeon on Sunset. Season 2 was shot from December 2001 ‚Äì January 6, 2002. The show premiered on January 14, 2001 on Nickelodeon where ratings grew.

Taina was scheduled to air every Sunday at 6pm.V√°zquez, Richard. \\"lasculturas.com.\\" Tania. N.p., n.d. Web. Jun 23, 2010. . The show was even put on Nickelodeon's SNICK lineup on Saturday nights from January to May 2002, where ratings more than doubled in its second season. Despite its popularity, (the show garnered Nickelodeon its highest ratings in 3 years) the show was cancelled that June because Nickelodeon thought the show only appealed to girls. CBC reran the show for a few months in 2003. Cancellation In July 2002, Nickelodeon announced that Taina was cancelled after two seasons, due to their consensus that the show was only appealing to a female demographic. According to Josh Cruze, the show was also getting more expensive to produce. According to Vidal in a later interview, scripts for a third season and a made-for-television movie of the series were already written before Nickelodeon cancelled the show. Episodes=Series overviewSeason 1 (2001)Season 2 (2002)=Home releases Only one DVD release of the show titled after the pilot, \\"Be Careful What You Wish For\\"', was released in the UK, which features the first four aired episodes.

The Polish Constitution Day Parade in Chicago is the largest Polish parade outside of Poland,According to many written sources, ex. \\"Dziennik Zwiazkowy/Polish Daily News\\", No. 951, Chicago 27 April 2007. See also external link to this article and celebrates the anniversary of the ratification of the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791, which historian Norman Davies calls \\"the first constitution of its kind in Europe\\". It is the second in the world only to the United States Constitution. For 115 years, Polonia's various community organizations have come together to organize this traditional Chicago salute to pride and tradition. Every year the parade is held on the Saturday closest to the third day of May. The main organizer of the Parade is the Association of Polish Clubs, under whose leadership the Grand Marshal and Queen of the Parade are elected. Organizers allocate than places in the marching column to all participants (like organizations, schools, bands, folk dancing groups). The parade has also been an occasion that both local and national politicians have used to curry favor with Chicago Polonia, or Polish community. Most notably Robert F. Kennedy attended the festivities on May 7 of 1961 along with attending mass at Holy Trinity Polish Mission before the parade. The Polish constitution established a constitutional monarchy with three definite branches of government and extended rights to social classes. The parade takes place by expressing the Polish values, traditions, and history all outside, being one of the biggest parades. The very first Parade took place in 1892 in Humboldt Park, which - at the time - was located in the heart of Polish Downtown. After World War II the parade was moved to downtown, first to State Street, then to Dearborn Street, and finally - from 2003 - to Grant Park. Every year the Parade starts from the location of Buckingham Fountain and ends by the bridge over the Chicago River. Today, the river of Dearborn South is a stream of red and white as everyone comes out to show their polish pride. The parade is filled with floats that are decorated and have emblems and logos of the Polonian organizations. There is a mix of marchers representing their organization, dancers, and marching bands all added to the event. Chicago's Polonia, the largest Polish community outside Warsaw proudly participate in the Parade in Downtown Chicago. During the Parade in 2006, 144 marching groups participated with an audience of - according to various sources - between 60 and 140 thousand people. Each year, the parade collects a crowd of thousands of people dedicated to Poland. As the parade is taking place, music is playing, dancers are dancing, and people are marching. The Polish Constitution Day Parade is also available on-demand at Parade filmed by local TV channel. Television stations that provide the Polish parade are expected to draw thousands of more views through television coverage. John Wayne Gacy John Gacy with First Lady Rosalynn Carter on May 6, 1978 In 1975, now-infamous serial killer John Wayne Gacy was appointed director of the parade, which he supervised from 1975 until 1978. Through his work with the parade, Gacy met and was photographed with then First Lady Rosalynn Carter on May 6, 1978. Rosalynn Carter signed one photo: \\"To John Gacy. Best wishes. Rosalynn Carter\\". The event later became an embarrassment to the United States Secret Service, as in the pictures taken Gacy can be seen wearing an \\"S\\" pin, indicating a person who has received special clearance by the Secret Service.

He was named at full-forward in North Melbourne's official 'Team of the Century'. Spencer started his league career in 1948 and the following season topped North Melbourne's goalkicking for the first of seven times with 65 goals. A consistent performer up forward, Spencer topped the club's goalkicking every season to 1956 with the exception of 1953 when he only managed to play four games. He had his most prolific year in front of goal in 1950 when he kicked 86 goals and finished runner up behind John Coleman in the league's goalkicking charts. In round 16 against South Melbourne he kicked a career best 11 goals, the first double figure bag of goals in a game by a North Melbourne player. The record was equaled in 1981 by Malcolm Blight and passed by John Longmire in 1990. That season he was also a member of North Melbourne's inaugural grand final side but his three goals couldn't prevent his side from going down to Essendon. He won the North Melbourne Best and Fairest in 1951. Spencer regularly represented Victoria at interstate level, most notably at the 1956 Perth Carnival where he was the leading goalkicker with 17 goals. His final league tally of 475 goals was a club record until surpassed by John Longmire during the 1990s. He topped the Goulburn Valley Football League goal kicking with Shepparton United Football Club in 1963 (71) and 1965 (61).

Clark Jr. (February 12, 1930 ‚Äì December 13, 2004) was an American football player and coach. He was the head coach at Washington State University for four seasons, from 1964 through 1967. Early life and playing career Born in Wichita Falls, Texas, Clark graduated from high school in 1948 and played college football at the University of Oklahoma under coach Bud Wilkinson. He lettered three seasons from 1949 to 1951, as the Sooners posted records of Clark was a two-time All Big Eight Conference linebacker and helped the 1950 Sooners capture a national title. After a brief stint with the Dallas Texas of the National Football League (NFL) in 1952 and a season with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1953, Clark served in the United States Army. Assistant coach Following his military service, he was an assistant coach for a season at the University of Arkansas in 1956 under former Sooner Jack Mitchell, and then joined the staff of first-year head coach Jim Owens at the University of Washington in Seattle in 1957. Owens and Clark were teammates at Oklahoma in their undefeated 1949 season. Washington State After seven seasons in Seattle with Owens at Washington, he was hired as head coach at Washington State in Pullman in January 1964; his initial contract was a three-year deal for $16,500 per year. On the Palouse, he was near another former 1949 Sooner teammate, Dee Andros, who was in his third (and final) season as head coach of the Idaho Vandals, to the east. Clark's first WSU team lost both rivalry games, expectedly to Washington in the Apple Cup, but unexpectedly to Idaho in the Battle of the Palouse, the Vandals' first win the over the Cougars in a decade. His 1965 team was nicknamed \\"The Cardiac Kids\\" for their dramatic late-game comebacks against Iowa, Minnesota, Villanova, Indiana, and Oregon State. It was also the only team in school history to defeat three Big Ten teams (Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana). The Cougars finished at and beat Oregon and Oregon State, but lost to both Idaho and Washington for a second consecutive year. It was the first time the Cougars had lost two straight to the Vandals in forty years, done before a record-breaking crowd of 22,600 at Rogers Field. Following the 1965 season, Clark signed a new three-year contract, at $19,700 per year. Expectations were high for 1966, but the Cougars were 3‚Äì7 and nearly lost to Idaho for a third straight year in a sloppy mudbath at Neale Stadium in Moscow. Two fourth-quarter WSU touchdowns, one on a fumble return and another on a long run from scrimmage after a Vandal fumble saved the day for the Cougars, 14‚Äì7. The Cougars were in conference, with a win over Oregon and losses to California, Oregon State, and Washington. The Cougars were winless through eight games in 1967, then thrashed Idaho 52‚Äì14 and squeaked by Washington in Seattle to finish at and in conference. Clark was fired in late November, with a season remaining on his contract. After Pullman Clark coached at the University of New Mexico in 1968 as defensive coordinator to first-time head coach Rudy Feldman, and went to the CFL in 1970 with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers under new head coach Jim Spavital. He later went into the investment business in Texas in Dallas and Galveston. Clark died in Katy, Texas in December 2004 at the age of 74 and was buried at Sacred Heart Cemetery in Wichita Falls.

The final-season title sponsors were SRAM Corporation and Cervelo bicycles. Velocio Sports was the holding company for the team and the place-holder during a larger search for a title sponsor. Before 2012, the team was owned by Bob Stapleton's High Road Sports and was known in 2011 as HTC‚ÄìHighroad Women. Following HTC's withdrawal of sponsorship and the failure to find a replacement sponsor, a new company, Velocio Sports, directed by High Road's former Marketing and Communications officer Kristy Scrymgeour, was set up to own the team, but most of the riders and other staff remained the same. High Road also operated an elite men's professional team known most recently as , which disbanded. Prior to 2008, the team was named T-Mobile Women. Columbia Sportswear were a title sponsor from July 2008 until the end of 2010. In August 2015, Scrymgeour announced that the team would be disbanded at the end of the 2015 season. Under Scrymgeour's management, and with the introduction of team time trials world championships for trade teams in 2012, the team has won every TTT world championships in the team's existence. History=2009 The main new riders for the team were the European Time Travel Champion Ellen van Dijk and the Canadian national champion Alex Wrubleski. Alexis Rhodes and Madeleine Sandig left the team and Anke Wichmann and Oenone Wood both retired. 20102011 The main new riders for the team were the Americans Amber Neben and Amanda Miller and the German time trial champion Charlotte Becker. Sadly, in January, Carla Swart died whilst training after being hit by a truck. After winning a stage, Ellen van Dijk won the Ladies Tour of Qatar which was the 400th victory for the team (men's and women's) since 2008. Ina Teutenberg won the fifth round in the Women's World Cup and the team won the seventh round, the Open de Su√®de V√•rg√•rda team time trial. The team finished second overall in the World Cup. Judith Arndt finished fourth in the individual standings and Teutenberg fifth. At the end of the season Arndt took the third place in the UCI World Ranking, Teutenberg fourth and the team ended in second place in the team classification. 2012 After the men's team HTC-Highroad stopped, Kristy Scrymgeour convinced manufacturer Specialized and sports apparel company Lululemon Athletica to perpetuate the women's team in this Olympic year. The team changed slightly: Clara Hughes and Trixi Worrack were the main new recruits, while Judith Arndt, team leader since 2006, joined GreenEdge-AIS. The team had a great year. Ina-Yoko Teutenberg won numerous sprints and finished fourth in the road race of the Olympic Games. Evelyn Stevens had an excellent season by winning at the world cup race Fl√®che Wallonne, she won a prestigious stage of the Giro d'Italia Femminile and finished on the podium in the end and she won the general classification of the La Route de France. At the end of the season the team was in fourth place in the UCI World Ranking. Ellen van Dijk won the general classification of the Lotto-Decca Tour, the Omloop van Borsele and several stage races.

The road runs through suburban neighborhoods before passing along the edge of Wilmington Airport, where it provides access to business parks. The Airport Road portion of DE 37 was originally a dirt road that was paved by 1942. DE 37 was assigned to its current alignment by 1985. Route description DE 37 northbound past DE 58 near New CastleDE 37 heads to the northeast from DE 273 on two-lane undivided Airport Road. It passes through suburban neighborhoods and then intersects DE 58 in a commercial area. Past the DE 58 intersection, the route widens into a four-lane divided highway and forms the northwestern boundary of the Wilmington Airport, with residential areas on the opposite side of the road. After the boundary with the airport, Airport Road splits to the northwest and DE 37 becomes Commons Boulevard, and it passes through the New Castle Corporate Commons, a business park located adjacent to the Wilmington Airport. The route continues northeast and intersects Spruance Drive, which is the entrance road to the Delaware Air National Guard's New Castle Air National Guard Base to the east, before it comes to its terminus at US 202/DE 141. DE 37 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 21,344 vehicles at the US 202/DE 141 intersection to a low of 8,264 vehicles at the DE 58 intersection. None of DE 37 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, the Airport Road portion of DE 37 existed as a county road. This road was originally a dirt road that was paved by 1942. In 1985, the Commons Boulevard portion of the route was built and DE 37 was designated to run along its current alignment. Between May 2005 and June 2006, DE 37 was reconstructed and widened from a two-lane road to a four-lane divided highway along Airport Road between DE 58 and Commons Boulevard.

It is used mostly for American football and soccer matches, and also sometimes for athletics. It was built in the early 1950s, opened in 1951 and is dedicated to Joliet residents who fought in World Wars I and II as well as the Korean War. In 1946, the Joliet Junior Chamber of Commerce chose a board to start building a stadium. Andrew B. Barber was named Chairman and he had a four person committee. The five presented their idea to the Joliet Park District officials. The officials wanted proof that the residents of the district would approve of the building of the stadium. In one month's time, the officials gained petitions with the signatures of 22,000 residents of the Joliet park district. After seeing the signatures, park officials allowed the building of the stadium to begin. The stadium was built in 1951 dedicated to the Joliet residents who served in World War I, World War II, and the Korean conflict. The dedication ceremony was held on September 14, 1951. The stadium was originally used to hold sporting events for schools in the Joliet Area. Upon opening in 1951, Joliet Catholic High School and Joliet Township High School became tenants as their schools‚Äô football teams began playing their home games at the stadium. The first football game was played in the stadium was on September 14, 1951 between Joliet Catholic High School and Rock Island Alleman High School. In 1952, the track around the football field was opened for racing. The track was a quarter mile, which is a good size for midget race cars. Originally the track was a cinder track because of low cost and easy to repair. The cinder track did not last long, because drivers were getting hit in the face with pieces. A year later a layer of clay was added over the cinder track, which was a temporary fix as the cars would peel the clay off the track. Today it is the home of the University of St. Francis Saints team, and the Joliet Catholic Academy Hilltoppers & Angels teams. It is the former home of the Joliet Junior College Wolves football team after the school cancelled the program in 2011, Joliet Township High School (becoming JT Central in 1964) and the Joliet Buccaneers of the MidStates Football League after they moved to Naperville, Illinois. The stadium was home to The Semi-Pro Joliet Explorers from 1964-1966 and Semi-Pro Joliet Chargers in 1967. It was also the home of the National Christian College Athletic Association National Championship for Outdoor Track and Field from 2011-2013. It is used for other events, including Independence Day fireworks as well as summer festivals. For many years after it opened when the track surrounding the football field was made of cinders, the stadium also doubled as the Joliet Speedway where it mainly hosted Stock car and Midget racing. The Stadium was the home of the United Auto Racing Association (UARA) and among the regular drivers at the speedway were midget racers from neighboring towns including Streator native Bob Tattersall (who would later go on to win the 1969 USAC National Midget Championship) and \\"Wild\\" Willie Wildhaber from Lexington.. The Stadium would run speedway from its opening until 2009. During the 1960s the cinders track was replaced with asphalt.Illinois Digital Newspaper CollectionsJoliet Memorial Stadium - Midget In May 2009, renovations on the aging stadium began with the installation of a new, state-of-the-art LED video scoreboard to replace the old, screenless one. By the end of the renovations, planned to be sometime before the 2010 college football season, artificial turf will be installed, along with a new track surface to surround the field.

Early life Welch was a full-blood Chippewa born in Spooner, Wisconsin. He attended the Carlisle Indian School, located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and graduated in 1911. Gus was one of Carlisle's first honor students. While at Carlisle, Welch was the quarterback for the schools football team, that featured Jim Thorpe and was coached by Pop Warner. He was a member of the USA Track and Field team during the 1912 Summer Olympics, although an illness prevented him from competing. After 1912, Welch played professional football for the Canton Bulldogs, coached by Thorpe. In 1917, Welch graduated from the Dickinson School of Law. Military In 1917, he entered the American Expeditionary Force during World War I as a Second Lieutenant, 808th Pioneer Infantry, under John J. Pershing. During his time in the military he achieved the rank of captain. He left the service in 1919. Coaching career From 1923 to 1929, Welch was the athletic director and head football coach at Randolph Macon College. From 1930 to 1934, he served as the head lacrosse coach at the University of Virginia. From 1935 until 1937, Welch served as the director of athletics and head football coach at Haskell Indian Nations University, located in Lawrence, Kansas. Afterwards he served as the head coach at Georgetown Prep School. From 1937 to 1938, he served as head football coach at American University where he compiled an overall record of two wins, ten losses and one tie. During World War II he was in charge of Physical Fitness at Georgetown University; and by 1947 taught physical education at Lyndon Hill Junior High School, located in Prince George County, Virginia. Camps In 1929, Welch purchased a boy's camp near the Peaks of the Otter in Bedford County, Virginia, which he operated during the next 30 summers as Camp Kewanzee for young people. In 1939, some of his land was condemned by the US Department of the Interior to extend the Blue Ridge Parkway, a seizure Welch fought vigorously. He then purchased a farm near Bedford, Virginia, and continued to work with young athletes. Gus finally served as athletic director at American University in Washington, D.C. prior to his 1970 death. Honors In 1973, Welch was named to the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame and in 1975 to National Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame. In the late 1960s, Welch's help was sought by both the Jim Thorpe Project of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and the Jim Thorpe Athletic Award Committee of Yale, Oklahoma. Family In 1923, Welch married Julia Carter, daughter of Charles David Carter, Oklahoma Congressman from Boggy Depot. A Chickasaw, Carter descended from David Carter, a white man captured in Connecticut and raised as an Indian who elected to remain with them as an adult, married an Indian woman, and for a time edited The Phoenix, an Indian newspaper. The Welchs had no children but adopted a niece, Serena, who became the model for the figure portrayed on the canning labels of Pocahontas Foods. Carter's family was also close to Vinnie Ream, after whom Vinita, Oklahoma is named. Ream became a sculptor of several statues in Washington, D.C., including one of Abraham Lincoln placed in the United States Capitol rotunda.

In all game versions the player takes control of a running Aztec warrior. The first was a side-scrolling platform-jumping game created by Robert Tegel Bonifacio and released in 1982 for the Atari 8-bit family. Subsequently, a different game with the same title and overall theme was created by Paul Norman and released for the Commodore 64. It included a level in a modified-first-person 3D-style. Atari 8-bit computer version (1982) The original 1982 Cosmi release of Aztec Challenge on the Atari 8-bit Improved 1983 version, also on the Atari 8-bit The original version of the game on the Atari 8-bit computers presented itself as a side- scroller, with the player's character running continuously from left to right as the background and path continuously scrolled. Control was limited to jumping at three different heights; holding the joystick down and pressing the button resulted in a low jump, holding the joystick up and pressing the button resulted in a high jump, and pressing the button by itself resulted in a medium jump. The running speed of the character was constant; only the height of the jumps differed, although speed of the character gradually increased of its own accord with each passing level. In two-player mode, each player controlled a different colored character with one character running in front of the other. The object of the game was to cover as much distance as possible without succumbing to the assorted perils of the path. Obstacles included platforms and ceilings of differing heights, pits, spikes, platform steps of staggered heights, and other assorted pitfalls. Contact with any part of the landscape other than the path would result in the loss of a player's life and would return the player to the last checkpoint. Different versions There was more than one different version of Aztec Challenge on the Atari 8-bit, although (unlike the very different Commodore 64 release) all featured the same basic side-scrolling gameplay. The game was originally released as The Bonifas through the Atari Program Exchange under a non-exclusive agreement. However, the title was picked up almost immediately for distribution by Cosmi, who renamed it Aztec Challenge and had a simultaneous two-player option added. In 1983, Cosmi released another version (still sold as Aztec Challenge) featuring significantly improved graphics, but similar gameplay. Commodore 64 version (1983)=Gameplay The player must guide their character through seven different levels. In every level new deadly perils lurk for the hero. The first, entitled The Gauntlet, is probably the most famous level. It sees the player running towards a temple in the distance. On the left and right are some aztecs, who throw spears at the player, who must duck under the spear or jump over it (depending on the height the spear is coming at). If the player fails to avoid a spear they are placed back at the start of the level. In the second level, The Stairs, the player is required to dodge left and right to avoid stone blocks thrown down at them as they ascend the stairs of the temple. Level 3 is The Temple which features traps which must be avoided by pausing the protagonist's motion or jumping. Level 4, The Vermin works in a similar way to the preceding level with the control system offering the choices of high and low jumps in this section. Level 5, Hopaztec, asks the player to cross a tile-filled room, avoiding booby-trapped tiles. In Level 6, Piranha, the player must swim across a lake avoiding the deadly man-eating fish. Level 7, The Bridge is the final level. The player runs automatically to the right and gaps in the bridge must be traversed by low, medium or high jumps depending on the size of the gap. Music The music was written by Paul Norman (the game author), who was a musician before becoming a computer programmer. The slowly, but gradually unfolding tunes become increasingly tense and complex as the player progresses through the long, monotonic and increasingly difficult levels. Reception Your Commodore's reviewer praised the \\"high standard of graphics and sound\\" in the game and thought it was \\"one of the best games around.\\" Legacy This game was remade in 2003 by Paul Norman as Azteca: Queen of Quezalcoatl. It is only found on his website, DigiTTARIUS. A clone of Paul Norman's Commodore 64 version of Aztec Challenge was released in 2006 for the Atari 2600 as A-VCS-tec Challenge.

The route ran from an intersection with unnumbered Duncan Road, just west of DE 41, north of Prices Corner to DE 100 near Elsmere. Along the way, the route intersected DE 41 and DE 141 as it passed through suburban areas to the west of Wilmington. The road was paved in the 1930s and designated DE 34 in 1974. The DE 34 designation was removed from Faulkland Road in 2019. Route description DE 34 westbound approaching DE 141 west of Wilmington in 2018 DE 34 began at an intersection with Duncan Road north of Prices Corner and headed east on two-lane undivided Faulkland Road through wooded areas and homes, crossing Hyde Run. The route intersected DE 41 and passed north of Brandywine Springs Park, where a park and pool lot is located, before it crossed Red Clay Creek and the Wilmington and Western Railroad at-grade. The road continued east through suburban neighborhoods, crossing Centerville Road. Farther east, DE 34 ran through residential and commercial areas, crossing Little Mill Creek before it came to an intersection with DE 141\\\\. Past this junction, the route passed to the south of DuPont's Chestnut Run Plaza research facility and headed across Chestnut Run. DE 34 crossed an East Penn Railroad line at-grade and headed between two cemeteries before ending at DE 100 north of the town of Elsmere, just west of the western city limit of Wilmington. DE 34 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 9,141 vehicles at the DE 100 intersection to a low of 3,482 vehicles at the DE 41 intersection. None of DE 34 was part of the National Highway System. History Faulkland Road originally existed as a county road by 1920. By 1936, the road was paved. DE 34 was designated onto Faulkland Road in 1974 in order to give \\"proper recognition\\" to the important connector road that linked DE 41, DE 141, and DE 100\\\\. In 2019, the Delaware Department of Transportation proposed removing the DE 34 designation from Faulkland Road in order to reduce traffic volumes and truck traffic along the road, which runs mostly through residential areas. The removal of the designation occurred in the middle part of 2019.

Located at the university‚Äôs Homewood campus at the Charles Village neighborhood in northern Baltimore. It is the core institution of Johns Hopkins, offering comprehensive undergraduate education and graduate training in the humanities, natural and social sciences. Notably, the French department was recognized as a \\"Center of Excellence\\" in the study of French culture and language by the government of France, one of only six in the United States. The Writing Seminars department, a program in creative writing, was ranked second-best in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. The school is named in honor of Zanvyl Krieger.  History  Directly descended from the original Johns Hopkins University, which was founded as the nation‚Äôs first research university in 1876, the Krieger School is the core institution of the university. The current School of Arts and Sciences was formed when the Faculty of Philosophy merged with the Faculty of Engineering in 1967-1968. With over 60 undergraduate majors and minors and over 40 full-time and part- time graduate programs, the Krieger School‚Äôs educational offerings also summer programs available to high school students, visiting undergraduate students, and a post-baccalaureate pre-medical program. Among these academic programs, the Krieger School‚Äôs Biology, Creative Writing, English, German, History, History of Art, and Physics & Astronomy departments are among the top-ranked in the nation. In addition, not only are faculty members expected to spend as much time researching as teaching, but also, there are numerous research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, ranging from the university-sponsored Woodrow Wilson Undergraduate Research Program to the nationwide Fulbright Hays Program for graduate students. The most recent enrollment figures available number that the Krieger School has 2,790 undergraduate students, 32 post-baccalaureate students, 924 full-time graduate students, and 1,379 part-time graduate students. Academics=Humanities Gilman Hall, home of the humanities departments Hopkins students find areas of study in the humanities at Hopkins that either were not available in secondary school or were encountered only at an elementary or introductory level. Courses are offered in philosophy, classical Latin and Greek, history of art, creative writing, comparative literature, Near Eastern studies, film and media studies, and history of science and technology, as well as in the more familiar areas of English and American literature, history, and modern foreign languages. A departmental major allows the student to study a specific discipline in depth and generally leads to advanced study beyond the baccalaureate degree. Students usually take a fairly broad program in the humanities for the first two years. As their interests begin to focus on some specialty, students normally devote the last two years to intensive study in their major or concentration. In February 2018, investor and alumnus Bill Miller donated $75 million to the philosophy department, which will be used to increase the department's faculty and expand undergraduate and graduate programs. Natural sciences Mudd Hall, part of the JHU Biology Complex For the student considering a career in the sciences, Johns Hopkins has much to offer at the undergraduate level. The departments of Biology, Biophysics, Chemistry, Cognitive Science, Earth and Planetary Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics and Astronomy offer programs leading to bachelor's degrees. All programs offer a sound foundation in the sciences and mathematics and require course work in the humanities and social sciences. Some require a degree of proficiency in a modern foreign language. Research has always played an important role in the development of scientific ideas and in technological advancement. Most of the faculty members in the natural sciences are actively engaged in research, most often with graduate students. Undergraduates are also encouraged to undertake research under the direction of faculty members. While many of the programs and activities of the science departments are geared to preparation for graduate studies, the breadth and flexibility of the basic programs assure the student of an able preparation for any career in the sciences or related fields as an undergraduate. Social and behavioral sciences Mergenthaler Hall, home of the economics, sociology, art history, and political science departments The Hopkins student interested in the social or behavioral sciences will find a variety of programs available in anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology. As in most of the other academic areas at Johns Hopkins, the departments are oriented toward research and the curricula are primarily designed to lead to graduate study. Programs in the social and behavioral sciences are useful as preparation for advanced study in law, medicine, government, business, and urban problems. Independent work is encouraged. Departments Inside of Gilman Hall The Krieger School contains many degree-granting departments, programs, and centers: Notably, the French department was recognized as a \\"Center of Excellence\\" in the study of French culture and language by the government of France, one of only four in the United States. The Writing Seminars department, a program in creative writing, was ranked second-best in the nation by US News and World Report.

He was born in Glen Ross, Maryland, United States in 1807. His first invention was the Seed-Planter, patented October 14, 1834, which allowed farmers to plant more corn using less labor and in a shorter time. On August 31, 1836 he obtained a second patent for a cotton planter. This invention worked by splitting the ground with two shovel-like blades which were pulled along by a horse. A wheel-driven cylinder followed behind which dropped the seed into the newly plowed ground. Blair had been a successful farmer for years and developed the inventions as a means of increasing efficiency in farming.\\"The Black Inventor On-line Museum.\\" Accessed December 4, 2012. http://www.blackinventor.com/pages/henry-blair.html . In the patent records, Blair is listed as a \\"colored man,\\" making this identification the only one of its kind in early patent records. Blair was illiterate, therefore he signed his patents with an \\"x\\". It is said that Blair was a freedman. At the time that his patents were granted, United States patent law allowed both freed and enslaved people to obtain patents. In 1857, this law was challenged by a slave-owner who claimed that he owned \\"all the fruits of the slave's labor,\\" including his slave's inventions. This resulted in a change of the law in 1858 which stated that slaves were not citizens, and therefore could not hold patents. Blair died in 1860. In 1871, six years after the American Civil War ended, the law was changed to grant all men patent rights.

The settlement was not successful and they returned to live in Salt Lake City, where Felt was a stake young women's organization officer and ward Primary president. Encouraged by Louise, Joseph married two other women, and though Louise was unable to have children, she helped raise the children and grandchildren of her sister wives. In 1880, Felt was appointed as general Primary president in 1880, but was not involved in its administration until 1890. Felt and the members of the Primary raised funds for charity, for the initial publication of The Children's Friend, and for the construction and administration of the LDS Children's Convalescent Home and Day Nursery. Felt received training in Progressive education and used her knowledge to make changes to Primary curricula. She divided children into age groups and included stories, crafts, and games in lessons. Felt was very close friends with her sister wives and the Primary secretary, May Anderson. Anderson lived in the same home as Felt and they shared a bedroom. Two Mormon historians speculate that their relationship may have been romantic, an argument partially based on florid descriptions of their love for one another published in The Children's Friend. Three other Mormon historians counter that such florid prose describing intimacy was normal for relationships between women in 19th-century America and assert that their relationship was platonic. Early life Louise Bouton was born May 5, 1850, in South Norwalk, Connecticut. She was the third child of Joseph Bouton and Mary Rebecca Barto. Her parents had become members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints several years before her birth. In 1864, the Bouton family started to travel to Utah Territory to join other Latter-day Saints there, but postponed their journey after all their possessions were destroyed in a baggage car fire on the way to Nebraska. They succeeded in 1866, and on the journey to Utah, Louise met Joseph H. Felt in Omaha. Because Joseph Bouton was ill, he and his family stayed in Omaha for six weeks. During that time Joseph Felt courted Louise, and they were married in Salt Lake City on December 24, 1866. Joseph Felt was the eldest son of Nathaniel H. Felt.Orson F. Whitney. History of Utah: Biographical. (Salt Lake City: G. Q. Cannon and Sons, 1904) p. 548 Married life and sister wives Brigham Young sent Felt and her husband to Muddy River in 1867, along with nine other young couples. They made their own adobe home, but due to severe weather and the remoteness of the area, they returned to Salt Lake City in 1869. In 1872, Felt used her inheritance to buy a house there. In the Salt Lake 11th Ward, Felt befriended Lillie Tuckett Freeze. Felt herself stated that Lillie Freeze and Mary Ann Freeze supported her spiritual development at the time. Mary Ann Freeze called Felt as the first counselor in the stake young women's organization and she became her ward's Primary president in 1878. Felt was unable to have children after a miscarriage from her time in Muddy River. She encouraged her husband to live the Latter-day Saint law of plural marriage. Joseph married Elizabeth Mineer in 1875 and Elizabeth Lidell in 1881. Felt helped look after and raise the children of these women. Elizabeth Lidell divorced Joseph Felt and moved to California with her children at some point. During the government attempts to prosecute polygamists, Felt twice left Utah Territory to avoid testifying in court against Joseph. Felt's sister wife Elizabeth Mineer went into hiding, and Felt often arranged for Elizabeth to visit her children for a day, driving a disguised Elizabeth to their home in a cart in the middle of the night. Louie Felt Keysor, one of the daughters of Elizabeth Mineer, died, and Felt helped raise her four children. Joseph Felt served a mission in 1883 in the Indian Territories and again 1885‚Äì1887 in the Eastern States. After his return, he still traveled frequently in his work as a travelling salesman for ZCMI. Joseph Felt died in 1907. In 1918, Felt was described as having been an exemplary wife fulfilling the role of a helpmeet to man.Children's Friend (Oct. 1919). At Felt's funeral she was described as being \\"devoted to her husband and to his children. She was a good house-keeper, a real home-maker. Her devotion to her husband was the kind that helped him to stand by his ideals of right.\\"Kerr, Children's Friend, p. 99 (Mar. 1928).Deseret News, 1928-02-15, sec. 2, p. 1. Service in the Primary Association Eliza R. Snow, Presendia Kimball and Zina Young asked Felt to be the first general president of the Primary in May 1880. She was officially appointed at the June 1880 jubilee celebration at a meeting of the associations presided over by Eliza R. Snow, which at the time included the Primary and young women's organization as well as the Relief Society. After Snow's death in 1887, Felt took a more active role in leading the Primary. Felt led the first Primary general conference in 1889. Not all wards held Primary classes, and those that did had poor attendance. Felt visited Primaries when invited, but had to use her husband's money to pay for her travel expenses, but she was not authorized to organize new Primaries. In 1888, Felt was sustained as General Primary President in General Conference. Lillie Tuckett Freeze was also sustained as her first counselor. May Anderson and Felt attended a training on kindergarten in 1895 and taught a progressive kindergarten class for four years to children ages three to six. Informed by this experience, they divided Primary classes in their local eleventh ward into three groups based on age, which increased attendance and decreased the number of children acting out. Felt suggested that other Primaries make similar divisions in their classes. The Primary general board made these class divisions a recommendation in 1898. Later, Felt made further divisions, dividing children into classes based on their age and groups based on their age grouping. Their lessons included stories, crafts, and games. Felt was often in poor health, and travel was difficult for her. In 1889, Felt rented her home to May Anderson's parents. During that year, Felt suffered from an illness, and May Anderson attended to her. At some point Felt appointed Anderson as the secretary to the Primary general board. While Anderson was an efficient organizer, Felt was a charismatic leader. Also in 1889, Felt held the first Primary worker conference to train Primary leaders. After the Free School Act of 1890 separated the LDS Church from public schooling, the LDS General Board of Education organized new after-school Sunday School classes for children, in addition to the Primary's lessons for children. For a time, these Sunday School classes for children competed with Primary classes for the attention of teachers and children. The First Presidency denied the Primary general presidency's petition to publish a journal on grounds that it would be too expensive. Felt asked William A. Morton, a children's book writer, to publish several issues of The Primary Helper, but it only lasted for a few issues. In 1901 Joseph F. Smith approved a Primary publication as long as it avoided debt and the Primary board managed its publication. Felt borrowed money to publish the first issues, putting her home up for collateral. Felt went forward with publishing the magazine even though the staff in the printing office tried to dissuade her from trying. The Children's Friend contained information and lessons to help the children's teachers. The magazine paid for itself in the first year. In 1902, the Primary general board held a conference for stake and ward officers in the Primary. Lillie T. Freeze and Josephine R. West were Felt's counselors that year. The Primary general board did not hold a conference in 1903 because of the cost, but held them annually in subsequent years. In 1913, the general board held a 6-week training for 130 women from stakes across North America received training in games, dances, and health curricula for children. In 1917, the Primary partnered with the Red Cross to help with the war effort, aiding in the supply of linens and other war necessities. Primary classes stopped meeting during the 1918 flu pandemic, and after they started meeting again, they raised over $4,000 in aid for Armenia, Syria, and Europe. In 1921, Anderson and Felt visited convalescent hospitals in the eastern part of the United States to learn best practices. They were disappointed by the lack of innovation. They were responsible for the administration of the LDS Children's Convalescent Home and Day Nursery, which opened on May 11, 1922. Felt also instituted the beginning of annual reports from local units (1881), the establishment of the Primary Annual Fund (1902) and spread Primary groups into every stake and many missions of the church. On October 6, 1925, Felt stepped down as general president of the Primary due to failing health. Her first counselor and close friend May Anderson succeeded her. Felt died in Salt Lake City of a cerebral hemorrhage.State of Utah Death Certificate Same-sex relationships Louise Felt (right), and fellow church leader May Anderson (left), who were dedicated friends and companions. Anderson served on the Primary Board with Felt was her caregiver during times of ill health. Felt had strong friendships with other women, especially her sister wives and the women she served with in the Primary leadership. D. Michael Quinn explained in his book on Mormon same-sex dynamics that same-sex Mormon friends often walked arm-in-arm, danced together, and kissed each other, as was accepted in 19th- century American culture. Writing for BYU Studies Quarterly, RoseAnn Benson noted that \\"florid expressions of love were part of Victorian prose and did not have the sexual overtones placed upon them by some today.\\" According to a biographical sketch published in 1919 in Children's Friend, Felt \\"fell in love with\\" Lizzie Mineer in 1874, and encouraged her husband to marry her as a plural wife, in part to bring children into the family. In 1881, when Joseph married Elizabeth Liddell, Louise Felt \\"opened her home and shared her life and her love.\\" In 1883, Felt met May Anderson, and their friendship soon \\"ripened into love\\", according to an anonymous biographical sketch of Anderson in The Children's Friend. The same sketch described their new relationship as devoted, stating \\"there never were more ardent lovers than these two.\\" Though acknowledging a lack of direct proof, Quinn and O'Donovan speculate that Felt and Anderson could have been romantic partners.Connell Hill O'Donovan (1994) \\"'The Abominable and Detestable Crime Against Nature': A Brief History of Homosexuality and Mormonism, 1830-1980,\\" Multiply and Replenish: Mormon Essays on Sex and Family (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books). At the FARMS Review of Books, George L. Mitton and Rhett S. James argue that Quinn inaccurately classifies Felt's relationships with other women as romantic. Joseph Felt did not marry Anderson, but in 1889, at a time when Lousie Felt was ill, May moved in to Felt's home. As a polygamist, Joseph had two houses, and it is unclear where he spent most of his time. Quinn stated that Joseph lived in his other home after May moved in. Mitton and James argue that the actual living arrangements of Joseph Felt are difficult to verify because after the 1890 Manifesto polygamous families often sought to obscure their living arrangements. After Joseph's death in 1907, Felt and Anderson continued to live together, sleeping in the same bedroom until a few years before Felt was released as Primary president in 1925, when Anderson moved out. They were referred to by others as the \\"David and Jonathan of the Primary\\", a term they embraced. According to Mitton and James, David and Jonathon's relationship in the Bible was not interpreted as a sexual relationship by the LDS Church, but as one of fraternal love.

The station is simulcast on FM translator W285FO (104.9), licensed to Grand Rapids, and the HD2 subchannel of Hot adult contemporary sister station WLHT-FM 95.7. History=WGRD The station first began broadcasting under the WGRD call sign in 1948. As AM 1410 was originally a daytime-only station, the WGRD calls stood for Grand Rapids Daytime. The station adopted the Top 40 music format in 1959 and was a top-rated station in the Grand Rapids market during the late 1950s and early 1960s, though the station had lost ground to WLAV 1340 and WZZM-FM 95.7 by the end of the decade. WGRD made a number of formatic adjustments in the mid-1960s in response to its falling ratings, shifting to an adult contemporary format in 1964 and then to a Top 40/oldies mix the following year before tweaking back to Top 40 in 1967. WGRD reclaimed its market dominance after it added an FM signal at 97.9 MHz in 1971 (formerly WXTO), though AM 1410 was relegated to being a simulcast of the FM signal mornings and afternoons. For part of that time middays were \\"shadowcast.\\" Same format, different dj. WXQT/Great Gold 14-K In 1981, WGRD dropped its simulcast (middays were shadowcast) of the FM station and switched to a \\"Big Band\\" Music of Your Life format as WXQT. In 1984, WXQT flipped to oldies as \\"GREAT GOLD 14-K\\", which stood for \\"14 Karat Gold\\", focusing on pop oldies from 1958-1972. Under the direction of PD Allen Jackson, \\"The NEW 14-K\\" featured Jack Stack (who had done mornings on WGRD and WLAV back in the 1960s) mornings, Rich Kennedy middays, Larry Olek afternoons and Pugs Stella evenings. The station earned a respectable 2.4 share 12+ in the Summer 1984 Arbitron. In 1986, the local lineup was dropped in favor of the ABC/Satellite Music Network \\"Pure Gold\\" satellite format. Ratings crashed to a 0.9 share in the summer of 1986 Arbitron, under the new call sign WKTH. More changes In 1988, the station adopted Satellite Music Network's Z-Rock format, keeping the WKTH call letters. The station reverted to the WGRD calls in 1991, moving back to a simulcast of 97.9 FM's CHR format (which changed to Modern Rock in 1994). In 1996, WGRD changed calls to WRCV and switched to ABC Radio's syndicated \\"Real Country\\" format. The station continued to be a non-factor in the ratings. In September 1998, 1410 changed its calls to WNWZ and adopted a simulcast of CNN Headline News, which was replaced by News/Talk in October 2001 (mostly syndicated from the Michigan Talk Radio Network). La Maquina Musical A Spanish pop hits format was adopted on January 1, 2003, and was somewhat successful in the ratings given its poor signal, often ranking as Grand Rapids' third most popular AM station (behind only WOOD and WBBL) (see: 1). WNWZ was the first radio station to cater to the Spanish-speaking community in Grand Rapids 24 hours a day. In August 2010, a reunion of more than 60 former WGRD staff members was held in Grand Rapids, which included market legend Bruce Grant, the original program director from 1948, and dozens of other personalities from the AM 1410/97.9 history.

They are found throughout the tropics. They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat. *Pheasant-tailed jacana, Hydrophasianus chirurgus Sandpipers and allies Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Scolopacidae Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers and phalaropes.

Her autobiography Offal Great: Memoirs of The Chitlin Queen is in the Smithsonian Anacostia Library and the Maryland Historical Society Library. Early life  Shauna Anderson was born in Washington, D.C. to Geneva Anderson, a professional singer and piano player and Walter Christopher Holmes, a saxophone player. She was raised by her maternal grandmother, Virginia L. Battle. Career She worked as an Economic Statistician with the Internal Revenue Service for 15 years, eventually utilizing the accounting and wealth building skills she learned at the IRS to begin her entrepreneurial ventures. Anderson started working in the chitlin business in the early 1990s. Her \\"Hand Cleaned Pork Chitterlings\\" earned her the moniker \\"The Queen of Chitlins\\" by former Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., and Saveur Magazine named Anderson \\"the source for chitlins\\" in 2007. Anderson had previously developed her own guidelines for cleaning chitlins when she discovered that Maryland Health Department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture had no regulations for the cleaning process. In 1995, Anderson opened her restaurant, \\"The Chitlin Market\\" in Prince George‚Äôs County, Maryland. Her business was depicted on an episode of ABC‚Äôs drama ‚ÄúCommander in Chief‚Äù, which sparked outrage from city officials. A 2007 news article from The Hill stated that her restaurant became a prop for ABC‚Äôs \\"stereotype of a poor, dangerous black neighborhood,‚Äù and the show was denounced by then County Executive Jack Johnson. In 2006, Anderson sued the county for what she claims were deliberate, concerted efforts to shut down the Chitlin Market. Her legal case was dismissed by Prince George's County Judge Sherri L. Krauser and was investigated by Senator Barbara Mikulski's office. Anderson is in the process of producing a documentary based on her short-lived business experience on Ager Road and the depiction of her business as ‚Äúdemeaning to the community.‚Äù She currently sells chitlins online and directly to restaurants and churches. Anderson's work has been featured in Saveur Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Jet Magazine and CNN.

Biography  Muhammad Ghawth was born in Gwalior, India in 1500; the name Gwaliyari means \\"of Gwalior\\". One of his ancestors was Fariduddin Attar of Nishapur. In the preface of al-Jawahir al-Khams, he states that he wrote the book when he was 25 years old. In 1549 he travelled to Gujarat, when he was 50 years old. He stayed in Ahmedabad for ten years where he founded Ek Toda Mosque and preached. Ghawth translated the Amrtakunda from Sanskrit to Persian as the Bahr al-Hayat (The Ocean of Life), introducing to Sufism a set of yoga practices. According to the scholar Carl W. Ernst, in this \\"translation\\", Ghawth intentionally reframed these practices with great subtlety to identify \\"points of contact between the terminologies of Yoga and Sufism\\". Ghawth died in Gwalior in 1562.

Her case set legal precedents for forced psychiatric care which have hamstrung involuntary psychiatric commitments of the homeless in New York and elsewhere. In late 1987, NYC Mayor Ed Koch announced a new program for removing mentally disturbed homeless people from the streets, based on a state law allowing involuntary hospitalization of mentally ill people who were considered dangerous. Brown was the first homeless person to be involuntarily committed to a treatment program under the new program. Brown was born on September 7, 1947 and became a secretary, living with her parents until they died in 1979, and then living with her sisters. She reportedly admitted to drug abuse including heroin and cocaine, and was arrested for an assault in Newark, New Jersey in 1982. In 1985, her sisters took her to East Orange General Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, where she was diagnosed as psychotic, was treated with antipsychotic medications, and was put in restraints after attempting assaults on the staff. In May, 1986, after an argument, she left her sisters' home and apparently became homeless. Brown had lived on a hot air vent grate near Second Avenue at 65th Street near a Swensen's Ice Cream Shop for about a year prior to her 1987 commitment. She was involuntarily committed to Bellevue Hospital on October 28, 1987 after a series of incidents which purportedly included running into traffic, exposing herself to passersby, making threats, tearing up and urinating on money that passersby gave her, and covering herself in her own excrement. She gave false names including \\"Ann Smith\\" and \\"Billie Boggs\\" (after Bill Boggs, a former local television talk show host in New York City), later claiming in court that she gave the false names to try to hide herself from her sisters. (Her sisters had been looking for her for some time, and went to Bellevue to identify her after recognizing court sketches of Brown in the news after her involuntary commitment.) During Brown's 1987-1988 commitment and trial, Dr. Francine Cournos, a Columbia University assistant professor of psychiatry, testified that Brown was mentally ill. Robert Levy, a staff attorney from the New York Civil Liberties Union (a state ACLU branch), defended her in court. On January 15, 1988, State Supreme Court Justice Irving Kirshenbaum ruled that New York City could not forcibly medicate Brown. Shortly thereafter, Acting State Supreme Court Justice Robert Lippmann ordered her released, in part because although she was mentally ill, her behavior was not obviously and immediately dangerous to anyone. She was released in late January after about eleven weeks of involuntary commitment and returned to the streets. She made appearances on talk shows and spoke at universities about homelessness. In 2000, the New York Daily News reported that Brown attended a talk sponsored by the Institute for Community Living. The article, which described Brown as \\"formerly homeless,\\" stated she was continuing to receive drug counseling and had recently suffered a stroke.\\"Participants Laud Drug Treatment Program\\" New York Daily News (May 2, 2000) The Social Security Death Index reports that Brown died on November 29, 2005.http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi- bin/ssdi.cgi ReferencesExternal links * New York Post article mentioning Boggs * New York Times article about the Kirshenbaum hearing and ruling * Article on involuntary hospitalization by Richard D.

These direct, non-violent ‚ÄúVisitation Bands‚Äù were successful and quickly spread first across the state of Ohio and then to a total of 22 other states from New York to California.

The word is probably most closely associated with college or university campus architecture, but quadrangles are also found in other buildings such as palaces. Most quadrangles are open-air, though a few have been roofed over (often with glass), to provide additional space for social meeting areas or coffee shops for students. The word quadrangle was originally synonymous with quadrilateral, but this usage is now relatively uncommon.\\"Quadrangle, n.\\" Oxford English Dictionary. Ed. J.A. Simpson and E.S.C. Weiner. 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxford University Press. 29 June 2006. Mob Quad, Merton College, Oxford is often claimed to be the oldest university quadrangle Some modern quadrangles resemble cloister gardens of medieval monasteries, called garths, which were usually square or rectangular, enclosed by covered arcades or cloisters. However, it is clear from the oldest examples (such as Mob Quad) which are plain and unadorned with arcades, that the medieval colleges at Oxford and Cambridge were creating practical accommodation for college members. Grander quadrangles that look like cloisters came later, once the idea of a college was well established and benefactors or founders wished to create more monumental buildings.See the references at Mob Quad Although architectonically analogous, for historical reasons quads in the colleges of the University of Cambridge are always referred to as courts (such as the Trinity Great Court). In North America, Thomas Jefferson's design for the University of Virginia centered the housing and academic buildings in a Palladian form around three sides of the Lawn, a huge grassy expanse. Later, some American college and university planners imitated the Jeffersonian plan, the Oxbridge idea, Beaux-Arts forms, and other models. The University of Chicago's Gothic campus is also notable for its innovative use of quadrangles. All five barracks at The Citadel (military college) feature quadrangles with red-and-white squares (the colors of the South Carolina battle flag), which are used for formations by the Corps of Cadets.

Professional boxing career  Anton Raadik was European Middleweight Champion in 1939. On May 13, 1939, he lost a three-round decision to middleweight Jimmy Reeves in Chicago in the International Golden Gloves. In all, he had a reported 130 amateur fights, winning 118. In 1940 and 1941 he had his first three professional fights in Moscow. In 1943 he won three more fights in Scandinavia, losing only to Oiva Purho in Gothenburg in 1944. Raadik fled the Soviet occupation of Estonia during World War II and settled first in Finland before moving to Sweden in 1945. He was inactive in 1945 and then moved to Chicago in 1946. In the USA, Raadik made rapid progress and in December 1946 fought the formidable Jake LaMotta. In 1947 he lost to two famous and experienced opponents, Georgie Abrams and Al Hostak. On October 31, 1947, he had his most famous fight, with future middleweight champion Marcel Cerdan, in Chicago. Cerdan was well ahead on points going into the tenth round, but then Raadik floored him three times and came close to stopping him, only to lose the decision. Raadik boxed until 1952, losing more fights than he won. He fought such highly regarded opponents as Carl (Bobo) Olson, Robert Villemain, Steve Belloise, and Harry (Kid) Matthews, but his heyday had passed.

Stafford owned both stations after acquiring them from Kortes Communications in 2000. History AM 1380 was originally WPLB, which featured a country format for many years. In October 2000, the station became WSCG and moved to a satellite-fed adult standards format from Westwood One. WSCG switched to a simulcast of CNN Headline News in October 2002 and the following year added more talk programming, much of it from the Michigan Talk Radio Network. WGLM-FM 106.3 was originally WRIZ and became WPLB-FM in 1993.

It runs from U.S. Route 13 Business (US 13 Bus., North Market Street) north to a modified cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) and US 202 at the northern city limits. North of the interchange, the route becomes US 202 northbound, also known as the Concord Pike. The road is two lanes and undivided for most of its length except for the part just south of the I-95 interchange, which is four lanes and divided. DE 202 was a part of US 202 until that highway was truncated to the I-95 interchange in 1970. DE 202 was designated by 1981. Route description The beginning of southbound DE 202 at I-95/US 202, with an erroneous end sign for US 202 DE 202 begins at an intersection with US 13 Bus. (North Market Street) in the city of Wilmington, heading north on two-lane undivided Concord Avenue. The road passes homes and businesses in the northern part of the city. Concord Avenue crosses several streets including Washington Street and Baynard Boulevard. At the intersection with the latter, the road becomes four lanes and becomes a divided highway at the Franklin Street intersection. After passing under CSX‚Äôs Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line, DE 202 reaches a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-95 and US 202, where DE 202 ends and the road continues north as part of US 202 (Concord Pike).

The entire length of DE 202 is part of the National Highway System. History When the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926, what is now DE 202 was designated as the southernmost part of US 122, a U.S. highway that ran from US 13 in Wilmington north to New Jersey. By the mid-1930s, the US 122 designation was replaced with US 202, and the route was shifted to head southwest from Concord Avenue and continue into downtown Wilmington on Washington Boulevard. By 1959, US 202 was moved onto a one-way pair through downtown Wilmington, with the southbound direction splitting from Concord Avenue to follow Baynard Boulevard to Washington Street and the northbound direction turning onto Concord Avenue at Market Street (US 13). In 1970, the southern terminus of US 202 was cut back to the I-95 interchange, leaving Concord Avenue unnumbered.

Austen tied with South Melbourne's Ron Clegg for the 1949 Brownlow Medal but was not awarded it based on the 'countback' system in place at that time. The League later changed the system for tied results and, in 1989, he was awarded the medal retrospectively. Hawthorn Football Club started 1950 in turmoil, Col Austen had sided with outgoing captain-coach Alec Albiston who was angry as he was told by a member of the board that he remain as captain. The club had appointed Bob McCaskill as coach and he wanted Kevin Curran to be captain. A huge internal split occurred, the board sided with the new coach and gave Albiston and Austen open clearances.Blair, p. 179. Austen was cleared to Richmond and played 51 games from 1950 to 1952. He was Captain/Coach of the Richmond Seconds side from 1953 to 1955, winning the competition's best and fairest, the Gardiner Medal, in 1953. He led the Tigers' seconds to the 1954 and 1955 Seconds premierships. Finally he went to Box Hill in the VFA as Captain/Coach in 1956 and non- playing coach from 1957 to 1959.

Biography Youngblood's main influence is King Curtis, although his earliest influence was his mother's favorite artist Louis Jordan. In 1966 Youngblood played with Hendrix on some sessions with various singers for producer Johnny Brantley. Three of these sessions yielded the Youngblood singles \\"Goodbye, Bessie Mae\\"/ \\"Soul Food (That's What I Like)\\" and \\"Go Go Shoes\\" (Parts 1 & 2), and five singles by other artists. After Hendrix' death Brantley put together an LP from these sessions, including the two Youngblood singles, the other artists singles plus a couple of out-takes from these sessions, adding some new overdubs to \\"improve\\" the sound. All of the original vocals by the other artists were wiped, although they can be heard faintly in places, and there was no mention of them. None of the original artists were credited - apart from Youngblood - and the cover misleadingly featured a 1969 photo of Hendrix and Youngblood jamming on stage. The sleeve notes falsely claim that these were Hendrix earliest recordings made in 1963. This date has clearly been demonstrated to be false by earlyhendrix.com.Early Hendrix site Lonnie Youngblood Discography He also worked from time to time in Curtis Knight & Hendrix' group Curtis Knight and the Squires. In 2010, Youngblood initiated a lawsuit against the Hendrix estate, MCA Records and film director Martin Scorsese, for their unauthorised use of what he claimed was his composition, \\"Georgia Blues\\", on the Jimi Hendrix album, Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues. His first professional job was backing up Pearl Reaves in 1959. He also got his stage name from Reaves. The first time she saw him, she exclaimed, \\"Oh, he's just a baby!\\" and from then on he was no longer Lonnie Thomas but Lonnie Youngblood. Youngblood's first solo recording, \\"Heartbreak\\" became a hit and help him work as bandleader for Faye Adams, Buster Brown, and Baby Washington. Youngblood was a regular on college campuses in the 1960s and appeared numerous times at the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity at Dartmouth College on which the Delta House in the film Animal House was largely based. Youngblood doesn't appear to have played with Hendrix after these 1966 sessions. Then in 1969 he was photographed jamming on stage with Youngblood in New York, and around this time he also added a lead guitar overdub to Youngblood's song \\"Georgia Blues\\". The two remained friends up until Jimi's death in 1970. Youngblood worked mostly as a backup musician during the remainder of the 60's for James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Ben E. King, Sam & Dave, and other soul greats. The recordings that Youngblood made that featured Hendrix amounted to four songs on two singles. They were released during Hendrix's lifetime. They were \\"Soul Food (That's a What I Like)\\" / \\"Goodbye, Bessie Mae\\" and \\"Go Go Shoes\\" / \\"Go Go Place\\".Early Hendrix site Discography Confirmed Lonnie Youngblood continues to perform, and is nicknamed the \\"Prince of Harlem\\". Solo releases Lonnie Youngblood has released at least four albums from the 1970s to the 1980s. Live At The Sugar Shack in 1971, Sweet Sweet Tootie in 1973 and the self-titled Lonnie Youngblood in 1977. All of them on the Turbo Records label.

The station is licensed to Walker, Michigan, and serves the Grand Rapids metropolitan area radio market. WTRV is a Class A station, so it is limited to 3,000 watts. Its signal can be heard as far south as Otsego, far east as Ionia, and as far north as Fremont. The studios and offices are on Ottawa Avenue NW in Grand Rapids.RiverGrandRapids.com/Help The transmitter is on Peach Ridge Avenue NW at 3 Mile Road, near Interstate 96.Radio-Locator.com/WTRV History=WQFN On June 15, 1993, the station first signed on as WQFN.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1995 page B-213 It was owned by William E. Kuiper, Jr. and had its studios and offices on Fremont Avenue NW. Kuiper served as the president and general manager, while his wife Ruth was the sales manager. For several years, WQFN was co-owned with Christian radio station WFUR and operated out of the WFUR studios. Originally WQFN was a fully automated adult contemporary station. After a year, it flipped to Smooth Jazz fed via satellite from Jones Radio Networks. The smooth jazz format was a moderate ratings success. Capstar ownership In 1998, the station was acquired by Capstar, which later became part of iHeartMedia, Inc..Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-230 Capstar switched the call sign to WTRV. The station featured a middle of the road (MOR) and soft AC format featuring a mix of light oldies and selected recent songs, from artists such as The Carpenters, Barry Manilow, Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand. These acts were no longer played on competitor and former easy listening station WOOD-FM (now WSRW). WTRV now features a softer, gold-leaning version of the Mainstream AC format formerly heard on sister station WLHT, which shifted to Hot AC in 2009. Regent/Townsquare ownership In 2000, the ownership changed again, this time to Regent Communications.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2005 page D-281 At the beginning of 2015, the station added more soft oldies and pop songs dating back to the 1970s, resulting in selected previously dropped tracks by artists such as the Carpenters and Manilow being re-added into rotation and becoming a younger-skewing version of the original \\"River.\\" The core artists include Celine Dion, Billy Joel, Elton John, Whitney Houston and Rod Stewart. The station's playlist now resembles gold-based soft AC stations such as WFEZ in Miami and WDUV in Tampa. WTRV aired Delilah's syndicated nighttime love-songs show for a time until it moved to sister station WLHT and later to what is now WSRW. Delilah is syndicated by Premiere Networks, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia, which owns WSRW. Christmas Music WTRV was the first station in the Grand Rapids market to switch to a format of all-Christmas music between Thanksgiving Week/Mid-November and Christmas Day. However, in 2007, the station did not make the usual switch. WTRV opted to continue with its regular format, with Christmas music mixed in for the holiday season. Meanwhile co- owned hot adult contemporary station WLHT-FM went all-Christmas (which it had never done before) to compete with WOOD-FM, which also goes all-Christmas every holiday season. In 2010, WTRV returned to an all-Christmas music format for the holidays, because WLHT-FM had moved to an adult Top 40 sound, not usually associated with Christmas music. In 2018, WTRV was the first station in the United States to flip to the all-Christmas format when it made the switch on October 29. Early adopters (such as frequent first-in-the-nation WEZW in South Jersey) waited until November 1 to switch, which factored into WTRV's decision to flip early.Venta, Lance (October 30, 2018). Christmas season begins in Grand Rapids. RadioInsight. Retrieved October 31, 2018. On October 29, 2019 at 5:00pm CDT WTRV flipped to the all-Christmas format, making it the 2nd station in the US for the 2019 Holiday season to flip to all-Christmas music, next to WWIZ which flipped on October 25, 2019 (though WWIZ's move, which included a change to a \\"Christmas\\" brand, was suspected of being a stunt).

Additional features are available as plugins. Plugins are available for network and molecular profiling analyses, new layouts, additional file format support and connection with databases and searching in large networks. Plugins may be developed using the Cytoscape open Java software architecture by anyone and plugin community development is encouraged. Cytoscape also has a JavaScript-centric sister project named Cytoscape.js that can be used to analyse and visualise graphs in JavaScript environments, like a browser.  History  Cytoscape was originally created at the Institute of Systems Biology in Seattle in 2002. Now, it is developed by an international consortium of open source developers. Cytoscape was initially made public in July, 2002 (v0.8); the second release (v0.9) was in November, 2002, and v1.0 was released in March 2003. Version 1.1.1 is the last stable release for the 1.0 series. Version 2.0 was initially released in 2004; Cytoscape 2.83, the final 2.xx version, was released in May 2012. Version 3.0 was released Feb 1, 2013, and the latest version, 3.4.0, was released in May 2016.  Development  The Cytoscape core developer team continues to work on this project and released Cytoscape 3.0 in 2013. This represented a major change in the Cytoscape architecture; it is a more modularized, expandable and maintainable version of the software.Cytoscape Product Roadmap  Usage  Yeast Protein‚Äìprotein/Protein‚ÄìDNA interaction network visualized by Cytoscape. Node degree is mapped to node size While Cytoscape is most commonly used for biological research applications, it is agnostic in terms of usage. Cytoscape can be used to visualize and analyze network graphs of any kind involving nodes and edges (e.g., social networks). A key aspect of the software architecture of Cytoscape is the use of plugins for specialized features. Plugins are developed by core developers and the greater user community.  Features  Input * Input and construct molecular interaction networks from raw interaction files (SIF format) containing lists of protein-protein and/or protein‚ÄìDNA interaction pairs. For yeast and other model organisms, large sources of pairwise interactions are available through the BIND and TRANSFAC databases. User-defined interaction types are also supported. * Load and save previously-constructed interaction networks in GML format (Graph Modelling Language). * Load and save networks and node/edge attributes in an XML document format called XGMML (eXtensible Graph Markup and Modeling Language). * Input mRNA expression profiles from tab- or space-delimited text files. * Load and save arbitrary attributes on nodes and edges. For example, input a set of custom annotation terms for your proteins, create a set of confidence values for your protein‚Äìprotein interactions. * Import gene functional annotations from the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG databases. * Directly import GO terms and annotations from OBO and Gene Association files. * Load and save state of the cytoscape session in a cytoscape session (.cys) file. Cytoscape session file includes networks, attributes (for node/edge/network), desktop states (selected/hidden nodes and edges, window sizes), properties, and visual styles. Visualization * Customize network data display using powerful visual styles. * View a superposition of gene expression ratios and p-values on the network. Expression data can be mapped to node color, label, border thickness, or border color, etc. according to user-configurable colors and visualization schemes. * Layout networks in two dimensions. A variety of layout algorithms are available, including cyclic and spring-embedded layouts. * Zoom in/out and pan for browsing the network. * Use the network manager to easily organize multiple networks. And this structure can be saved in a session file. * Use the bird's eye view to easily navigate large networks. * Easily navigate large networks (100,000+ nodes and edges) by an efficient rendering engine. Analysis * Plugins are available for network and molecular profile analysis. For example: ** Filter the network to select subsets of nodes and/or interactions based on the current data. For instance, users may select nodes involved in a threshold number of interactions, nodes that share a particular GO annotation, or nodes whose gene expression levels change significantly in one or more conditions according to p-values loaded with the gene expression data. ** Find active subnetworks/pathway modules. The network is screened against gene expression data to identify connected sets of interactions, i.e. interaction subnetworks, whose genes show particularly high levels of differential expression. The interactions contained in each subnetwork provide hypotheses for the regulatory and signaling interactions in control of the observed expression changes. ** Find clusters (highly interconnected regions) in any network loaded into Cytoscape. Depending on the type of network, clusters may mean different things. For instance, clusters in a protein‚Äìprotein interaction network have been shown to be protein complexes and parts of pathways. Clusters in a protein similarity network represent protein families.

The station's music is programmed by volunteers, drawing from a diverse library of eclectic music, primarily folk, rock, blues, worldbeat and jazz music, with some emphasis on local musicians. History It is licensed to Wyoming, Michigan, and began broadcasting in 1983 as an FM-based extension to a cable-based radio station that had been operating since 1978 on (then) GE Cablevision in the Wyoming and Kentwood areas. This station was licensed to Wyoming Community Education (the source of the station's call letters). In 1987, the Wyoming Board of Education, in response to concerns about the music its students were programming, transferred the license and sold the assets to Grand Rapids Cable Access Center (which operated a Public-access television cable TV channel known as GRTV), which was the forerunner to the Grand Rapids Community Media Center (GRCMC). For several years, a special committee of the GRCAC board known as the Friends of WYCE provided direction to the station staff and volunteers. In the mid-1990s, the studios were moved from the community education site in suburban Wyoming, joining other components of the GRCMC as they consolidated in renovated facilities on the second floor of the West Side Library, just west of downtown Grand Rapids. In the late 1990s the station got a new transmitter and tower, thereby increasing its signal strength and coverage. The tower is located on Woodward Ave SW, just south of 28th Street, in Wyoming, Michigan. In 2010 the station received clearance from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to expand its coverage area and power output, and so a new transmitter and antenna were purchased and installed. WYCE serves listeners in much of the West Michigan area including Grand Rapids, Holland and Muskegon. Programs WYCE is funded entirely by donations from listeners and local sponsors, and operated by nearly 100 volunteers and a small paid staff. In addition to broadcasting via its FM transmitter, it streams audio over the internet. WYCE operates 24 hours a day, mostly with musical programming hosted by live presenters. Most shifts feature music from all of the station's standard genres. An early-morning block of programming features a long-standing Spanish-language program featuring Mexican music. On Friday mornings, the station hosts a program that focuses on local/regional music called, \\"Local Spins.\\" The station also features a small number of prerecorded syndicated programs and community-affairs features. The station sponsors a variety of concerts and other events within the metropolitan Grand Rapids area. These include free concerts at which voluntary donations are solicited to support local charities. Since 2000, WYCE has presented \\"the Jammies\\", an annual awards program spotlighting local musicians.

It is based on the novel This Way Out, by James Ronald, and was released by Universal Pictures. It stars Charles Laughton and Ella Raines. Plot Philip Marshall (Charles Laughton) is a kind, henpecked accountant who strikes up a friendship with Mary Gray (Ella Raines), a young stenographer who had approached him looking for work. He gradually finds himself falling in love with her, but keeps the relationship platonic. Marshall's wife Cora (Rosalind Ivan), who has also alienated their son with her shrewish ways, discovers the affair; when Marshall asks her for a divorce, explaining that they would both be happier apart, Cora refuses and instead threatens a scandal. In order to protect Mary's reputation, Marshall breaks off their relationship and cuts all ties with her; despite his best efforts to reconcile with Cora, their marriage does not improve. Cora later dies after a fall down the stairs at home; it is strongly hinted that Marshall murdered her, although the death appears accidental. Inspector Huxley (Stanley Ridges) of Scotland Yard suspects that Marshall murdered his wife but is unable to prove it or establish a motive. Huxley follows Marshall, learning of Mary Gray, and interviews a number of the people in Marshall's neighborhood. When Huxley seeks to interview Mary directly, he is informed that she and Marshall were married earlier that day, making it impossible for Huxley to compel her to testify against her husband. Meanwhile, Marshall's drunken, wife-beating, spendthrift neighbor Gilbert Simmons (Henry Daniell) is interested to learn of the inspector's suspicions, and he relishes the chance to blackmail Marshall, whose respectability he envies. He threatens to invent a story about an argument between Marshall and his wife on the night of her death, which would substantiate that Marshall had killed his wife. Marshall poisons his neighbor, using an overdose of anodyne drops from a bottle that Simmons' wife had shared with him. Marshall and Mary plan to move to Canada to follow Marshall's son, who has recently received a position there from his company. When the inspector hears of Simmons' death, he sets a trap in which he pretends to frame Mrs. Simmons for the murder. The success of the trap depends on Marshall's coming forward, rather than letting the innocent woman hang. The inspector believes that, in spite of everything, Marshall has never lost his innate decency. The film ends with Marshall's wife and son sailing to Canada while Marshall disembarks at the last moment, presumably preparing to turn himself in.

In order to control the actor, he would not give him a full script, just discuss his scene the night before shooting. He also kept Laughton occupied during the shoot by having him rehearse the other actors calling him \\"a brilliant director of actors\\". He was warned that halfway through a film Laughton traditionally had bouts of uncertainty; when this happened during filming Siodmark threw a prepared tantrum; Laughton soothed him and the rest of the film proceeded smoothly.Encounter with Siodmak Taylor, Russell. Sight and Sound; London Vol. 28, Iss. 3, (Summer 1959): 180. Release Following a world-premiere screening December 22, 1944, in San Francisco, The Suspect was released nationally on January 26, 1945. Universal's promotion of the film included a 30-minute transcribed radio dramatization in which Orson Welles played the role of Philip Marshall. The disc was recorded by WOR Recording, New York, and was heard on six New York radio stations January 29‚Äì30, 1945. The Suspect was chosen to screen at the White House March 17, 1945, following a small formal dinner celebrating the 40th wedding anniversary of Eleanor Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Guests included Crown Princess Juliana of Holland. Reception The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther wrote, \\"Another study of an amiable, middle-aged fellow who commits murder out of desperation and his attempts at concealing his connection is being offered in The Suspect ‚Ä¶ The Suspect is by no means a dull picture, but it seems to lack that quality of excitement which in good melodrama keeps one on edge. In a word, it is too genteel. Henry Daniell, as the blackmailer, and Rosalind Ivan, as the exasperating spouse, are each splendid, and Ella Raines is most appealing as the second wife. It might be remarked, however, that her choice of a husband of Mr. Laughton's dimensions is a bit strange.\\"Crowther, Bosley. film review, The New York Times, February 1, 1945. Accessed: July 4, 2013. Variety magazine praised the film: \\"In Charles Laughton‚Äôs accomplished hands, this character becomes fascinating ‚Ä¶ There is less of the bluster and none of the villainy of Laughton‚Äôs previous vehicles. He gives an impeccable performance as the kindly, law-abiding citizen. Matching his deft portrayal is Ella Raines as the youthful steno he weds after his wife‚Äôs demise.\\"Variety. Staff film review, 1945. Accessed: July 15, 2013. Motion Picture Magazine gave the film a glowing review, praising the writing, directing and acting, saying \\"Without mincing words, Arthur T. Horman's adaptation from James Ronald's novel, magnificently transcribed to the screen by Bertram Millhauser, brilliantly directed by Robert Siodmak, who draws from Charles Laughton what is undoubtedly one of the finest characterizations of the latter's career, all combine to make The Suspect a superb thriller.\\" In 2011, online film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, writing that Siodmak \\"competently directs this theatrical studio-bound minor film noir, and keeps it more as a character study than as a whodunit. It builds on suspense, but never becomes that exciting or interesting. But it's well-acted, though the dreary story is never totally convincing or compelling.\\"Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, January 24, 2011. Accessed: July 15, 2013. Adaptations On April 9, 1945, The Lux Radio Theatre presented an hour-long adaptation of The Suspect, with Charles Laughton, Ella Raines, Rosalind Ivan, Denis Green, Lester Matthews and Eric Snowden. Charles Bennett adapted The Suspect for the June 2, 1955, episode of NBC-TV's Lux Video Theatre. Directed by Buzz Kulik, the hour-long program starred Robert Newton (Philip Marshall), Toni Gerry (Mary Gray), John Hoyt (Huxley), Erin O'Brien-Moore (Cora Marshall), John Dehner (Gilbert Simmons) and Richard Lupino (John Marshall).

The station operates with 500 watts during the day and 250 watts critical hours, but must sign off at night to protect 1530 WCKY in Cincinnati. WYGR programming is simulcast on FM translator W235BN at 94.9 FM, which can be heard in the immediate Grand Rapids area as far north as Cedar Springs and Allendale but gives way to co-channel WMMQ out of East Lansing east of Grand Rapids and fellow co-channel WKZC north and west of the Grand Rapids area. A second FM translator W258DF in Lowell was added in February 2019. History The station was granted its first construction permit on September 27, 1962 and was originally assigned the calls WYOQ. The FCC reassigned the stations calls to WERX on July 1, 1963. The station first began broadcasting in 1964 under the WERX call sign. WERX began as a MOR station but changed to Top 40 during the summer of 1965, and enjoyed moderate success as a Top 40 rocker until dropping the format in May 1968. The station's potential was always limited due to its poor signal and the fact that co-channel WCKY would begin to interfere with WERX's signal even before WERX's sign-off (and still does to this day). WERX provided an early air shift for John \\"Records\\" Landecker, later of WLS fame. The station has also aired news/talk (as WTKG) and adult standards as well as Contemporary Christian music (as WYGR) formats. From 1999 until February 2010, the station featured a Spanish-language format known as \\"La Furia.\\" The format consisted of a wide variety of different Spanish- language musical genres, including regional Mexican, grupera, ranchera, tropical, and mainstream Spanish pop and rock. Sunday programming included church services in Spanish and English as well as English-language polka and adult standards shows. In early February 2010, the former owner of WJNZ 1140 AM \\"1140 Jamz,\\" Robert S. Womack, moved that station's Urban AC format and air lineup to WYGR, in anticipation of WJNZ's switch to a Catholic religious format in the wake of its sale to Holy Family Radio. WJNZ, like WYGR, is a daytimer. It is unclear at this time if the WJNZ calls will migrate to 1530 AM to match the new format, but given the fact that WYGR now identifies as \\"GR1530,\\" it seems unlikely. WYGR also transmits FM rebroadcaster in the form of translator W235BN at 94.9 MHz, licensed to Grand Rapids. However, because of Lansing's WMMQ 94.9 there is slight interference, especially on the further east side of the city towards Kentwood. The translator will allow WYGR's programming to be heard around the clock; WTOU in Kalamazoo is a similarly formatted station with a likewise arrangement. In February 2012, it was reported that the translator had begun operations at 94.9 FM. On December 10, 2018, WYGR changed their format from urban adult contemporary to classic country, branded as \\"Jethro FM\\".Jethro Brings Classic Country to Grand Rapids Radioinsight - December 10, 2018 Programming The weekday hours previously consisted of the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show, followed by the midday drive featuring local Disc Jockey \\"DJ Z\\". The afternoon drive is fueled by the political talk show named \\"The Pulse Of The City\\" Hosted by Station General Manager and community activist Robert S. Womack. On Thursdays and Fridays \\"The Maddog Show\\" featuring \\"DJ Maddog\\" airs at 6p.m.. The shows format veers from the Urban AC normally aired on the station to a Mainstream urban format. Maddog's personality is also a stark contrast of the political seriousness of \\"The Pulse of The City.\\" FM urban radio in West Michigan WYGR's FM translator represented the latest attempt to bring an FM R&B; station to West Michigan. In 1993 the first attempt was launched at Muskegon's WMHG \\"Magic 108\\", also there was a second attempt with WKBZ launching as \\"Power 95.3\\" which have both since become defunct. Muskegon now has three FM stations catering to the Urban audience in the form of WUVS-LP 103.7 for hip- hop, WUGM-LP 106.1 for classic R&B;, and WVIB 100.1 for Urban AC. In 1994, Goodrich would tweak WSNX's Top-40 format into a Rhythmic Top 40 direction giving a more Urban Flavor in the Grand Rapids/Muskegon area. The Rhythmic direction has continued under Clear Channel's ownership. WSNX also features a prepackaged Hip-Hop/R&B; format from Clear Channel on its HD-2 side channel.

Goddard Award for distinguished contributions to photo reconnaissance. In 1967 he served as a U.S. Observer on an inspection of foreign bases in Antarctica under terms of the Antarctic Treaty. He was awarded the Antarctic Service Medal by the U.S. Navy.

Purcell.https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/news/press/2000/2000-07.pdf Although their early work was highly classified, this group of men went on to extraordinary public accomplishments, including a Secretary of Defense, a Nobel Laureate, a president of MIT, recipients of the Presidential Medal of Science, a renowned planetary scientist, and more.  Planetary Exploration (1965‚Äì2001)  In 1965 he participated in the first Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) attempt to fly to Mars a tiny primitive spacecraft carrying the world's first digital camera, Mariner 4, and the follow-on Mars flyby missions, Mariners 6 and 7. Then he went on to an unparalleled career in planetary exploration. He was a key member of the imaging teams of Mariners 6, 7, 9, and 10, of Voyagers 1 and 2 and Galileo and Cassini, of NEAR and Magellan. He was responsible for creating the geodetic control net for the mapping of the surface of Mars, and thus had the honor of establishing its prime meridian.Davies, M. E., and R. A.

When the data came in, it was Mert who established the coordinate systems for all of the target objects. The maps we have of Mercury, Venus, Mars and the satellites of the outer planets are all based on his work in establishing the point of zero longitude or the prime meridian for each object. As Bruce Murray has commented, to do so for even one such object would be a \\"major career achievement by any scientist,\\" but to be credited for having done so for essentially every large solid object in the solar system except Earth and Pluto provides \\"an instructive lens through which to view Davies accomplishment.\\"(EOS, 82, 46(13 November 2001):551‚Äì552.)https://baas.aas.org/obituaries/merton-edward- davies-1917-2001/Merton E.

It is a part of the Silver Falls School District, and is the only high school in the district. Campus Silverton High School, until recently, was divided between two campuses, the older Schlador Street campus, and the newer Pine Street campus. In 1994, voters passed the bond levy for construction of the first phase of a two phase project to build a new high school building. The new high school campus was constructed on Pine Street in Silverton, and was completed in 2002 with the capacity to hold approximately 500 students. However, the initial bond levy for the second phase failed, leaving the Silverton High School divided between its two campuses. As of the fall of 2002, roughly 350 freshmen were attending the Pine Street campus, and were routinely bussed to the old campus for higher level classes. Finally, in November 2006, a new bond levy was passed and the second phase of the high school construction was slated to begin. Construction was finished in August 2009. The Pine Street campus was opened on September 9, 2009; all four grades were joined in the same building for the first time in 12 years. Academics In 2008, 83% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 291 students, 241 graduated, 37 dropped out, four received a modified diploma, and nine were still in high school the following year.

He was the winning defensive coordinator in Super Bowl XXXI, following the 1996 season, and was the uncle of former New York Giants (2018‚Äì2019) head coach . Coach Shurmur was also the author of several books about defense, including Coaching Team Defense (1989), Coaching the Defensive Line (1997) and The Eagle Five Linebacker Defense (1993). Early life Nicknamed \\"Fritz\\" as a baby after his grandfather's cocker spaniel, Shurmur grew up in Wyandotte, Michigan, south of Detroit, along with his parents and his brother, Joseph. His nephew Pat Shurmur is the former head coach of the New York Giants; he was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns from 2011 to 2012 and has served in other coaching positions with other NFL teams, including one game as interim head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. Shurmur's father was a factory worker for 49 years in the suburbs of Detroit. Shurmur's parents twice refinanced the family home so Fritz and his brother could have opportunities to attend Albion College. Shurmur started playing football at Theodore Roosevelt High School in Wyandotte. After graduation in 1950, he played college football at Albion College in Albion, west of Detroit. Shurmur played center, earned All-Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) honors, and was named the conference's most valuable player. As a complement to football, Shurmur also played baseball at Albion, where he earned all-conference honors. Coaching career=College Shurmur became a graduate assistant at age 22 in 1954, under Albion head coach Morley Fraser. After receiving his master's degree in education administration in 1956, he stayed at Albion as a defensive coordinator. In 1962, Shurmur moved to the University of Wyoming as a defensive coach under first-year head coach Lloyd Eaton, who was promoted following the departure of Bob Devaney for Nebraska. The Cowboys won three consecutive WAC titles (1966‚Äì1968), which included a Sugar Bowl appearance after the 1967 season. Following a season in 1970, Eaton resigned and Shurmur was promoted to he had a record over four seasons NFL career From 1975 to 1999, Shurmur was a defensive coach in the National Football League with six teams. He coached for the Detroit Lions, New England Patriots, Los Angeles Rams, Phoenix Cardinals, Green Bay Packers, and Seattle Seahawks. For nineteen of those years he was a defensive coordinator. Throughout his career, Shurmur was widely known as an innovative mind on defense. Shurmur's coaching style was revered by peers in his profession for defensive genius. For example, in 1992 with the Cardinals, Shurmur had to devise a plan when two linebackers were injured. He developed a \\"Big Nickel\\" defense, that used five defensive backs close enough to the line of scrimmage to rush the passer or drop back into coverage. Shurmur became defensive coordinator for Green Bay in 1994 under head coach Mike Holmgren; in his third season with the team in 1996, the Packers won Super Bowl XXXI over the New England Patriots in January 1997. When Holmgren accepted the dual roles of head coach and general manager with Seattle in 1999, Shurmur went with him as defensive coordinator.

This never came to pass, as Why mysteriously disappeared in August 2009, deleting his projects. Because they were stored in git, the Ruby community was able to revive them. A small team kept working, releasing v0.9 on Christmas of 2009, and finally 1.0 on Christmas of 2010. Ruby Summer of Code 2010 Hackety Hack was chosen as a project for the Ruby Summer of Code in 2010. Fela Winkelmolen was the student chosen to work on the project. Chris Redinger, Jeff Casimir, Sarah Mei, and Steve Klabnik mentored.  Comparison with other educational software  The two largest similar projects are Scratch and Alice. There are two major differences: Both of these projects use a graphical programming language based on the concept of \\"blocks,\\" but Hackety Hack teaches Ruby. Both Scratch and Alice are university projects out of MIT and CMU, respectively, and Hackety Hack has no university affiliation.  Blocks vs Ruby The difference of 'blocks vs. Ruby' stems from a shared belief: most programming languages require a lot of effort and knowledge before one can build more than the simplest of programs. The 'blocks' solution is to use the concepts of graphical programming so that beginners don't have to worry about syntactical or memorization issues, as there's a palette of blocks to choose from, and they only fit together in the correct way. The solution that Hackety Hack pursues is by teaching with a more traditional programming language, but adding libraries that make it easy to do complicated tasks in one line. For example, in a more traditional software library, making a background with a gradient would take five or six lines of code using a toolkit like QT, but is one line in Hackety Hack. This is achieved by choosing simple defaults and dropping support for lesser-used options. Comparison with similar projects The university affiliation that Scratch and Alice enjoy gives them more resources to bring to bear. Both projects have teams of people, the brand credibility of their institutions, and graduate students to write papers about them and use them in research. Hackety Hack is a more nimble project, since the team is much smaller. It's also truly an open-source project, whereas the Alice project, for example, only releases dumps of the project source every so often. Hackety Hack's development is entirely open.

Commonly used to polish and conserve metal objects, it is also used on gemstones and such organic materials as wood, ivory, and tortoiseshell. The product is sometimes used by reenactors to protect armor and weapons. Waxes are more protective and longer-lasting than oil, especially for swords and helmets that are frequently touched by human hands. It has recently been introduced in the world of guitar building, as a finish that protects and gives colour to the wood. Wax coatings for conservation are most widely, and least controversially, applied to metals. This has several objectives: to produce a barrier that excludes moisture and oxygen from the metal surface, to preclude the introduction of contaminating elements by handling, and to provide a protective layer over anti-corrosion undercoatings. Microcrystalline waxes used on ethnographic metal objects are discouraged, as they may require extensive treatment for removal. Renaissance wax is used to protect metals such as silver, brass and copper from tarnishing, on collections of all types of metals (old coins, locks and keys, arms and armour both original and replica), on both the wood and metal surfaces of vintage cars and musical instruments, on bronze sculptures inside the home and outside exposed to the elements, on marble and granite worktops to prevent staining and on smooth leather items. Formulation Renaissance Wax was developed in the British Museum Research Laboratory by Dr A E A WernerWho's Who, 1998, p. 2099 in the late 1950s. It is manufactured by Picreator Enterprises Ltd. Earlier wax polishes based on beeswax and carnauba wax either contained acids or became acidic over time. Renaissance Wax is based on more stable microcrystalline waxes refined from crude oil.

Synopsis A couple, Jacques and Toinon, were very stingy. Their children ‚Äì Jean, who was twelve, and his sister Jeanette, who was eight ‚Äì suffered because of this, and finally they decided to lose them in the forest. Toinon took them and left them there. They tried to find her, and then tried to find their way out. Jean climbed a tree and saw a white house and a red house. They went to the red one. The woman there let them in, but told them to be quiet or her husband would eat them, because he was the Devil. She hid them, but her husband could smell them because they were Christians. He beat his wife and put Jean into the barn to fatten him up before eating him, making Jeanette bring him food. The Devil was too fat to get into the barn, so he ordered Jeanette to bring him the tip of Jean's finger to test how fat he was; Jeanette brought him a rat's tail. The third time, he noticed the trick and pulled Jean out. He made a sawhorse to lay Jean on to bleed, and went for a walk. Jeanette and Jean pretend not to understand how he was to be put on the sawhorse. The Devil's wife showed them, and Jean tied her on and cut her throat. They took the Devil's gold and silver and fled in his carriage. The Devil chased them. On the way, he met various people ‚Äì a laborer, a shepherd, a beadle, some laundresses ‚Äì and asked whether they had seen the children. The first time he asked, they each misheard him, but then told him they hadn't, except for the laundresses, who told him they crossed the river. The Devil could not cross it, so one laundress offered to cut her hair to let him cross on it, but when he was in the middle, the laundresses dropped it, so he drowned.

He played college football for Washington State from 1948 through 1950. Torgeson played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for seven seasons, principally as a linebacker, for the Detroit Lions from 1951 to 1954 and for the Washington Redskins from 1955 to 1957. After retiring as a player, Torgeson worked for 35 years from 1959 to 1993 as an assistant coach in the NFL. His coaching positions included stints with the Washington Redskins (1959‚Äì1961, 1971‚Äì1977, 1981‚Äì1993), Pittsburgh Steelers (1962‚Äì1968), and Los Angeles Rams (1969‚Äì1970, 1978‚Äì1980). He was a coach on three Super Bowl championship teams in 1982, 1987, and 1991. As a player and coach, he spent 42 years in the NFL, 26 of them with the Redskins. Early years Torgeson was born in La Crosse, Washington, a small town in the eastern part of the state, and attended La Crosse High School, and excelled in football, basketball, and baseball. College football After graduating from high school in 1947, Torgeson enrolled at nearby Washington State College in Pullman, where he played college football on the Cougars' varsity from 1948 through 1950. He played on both offense as a center and on defense as a linebacker. Torgeson was the team captain in 1950, and he was selected by the Associated Press (AP) as the first-team center on the All- Coast team. The morning of Torgeson's final game as a Cougar, the annual rivalry game with Washington in Spokane, his younger brother Robert, a sophomore at Washington State, died from carbon monoxide poisoning while sleeping in a parked car after traveling from Pullman to watch the game. Professional football Torgeson was selected by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round (58th overall pick) of the 1951 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he appeared in all 12 games for the Lions, playing at both the linebacker and center positions. From 1952 to 1954, he played at the right linebacker position for the Lions. During the Lions' NFL championship seasons in 1952 and 1953, he had ten interceptions, including a 31-yard interception return for touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams on October 19, 1952. In late January , the Lions traded Torgeson and Jim Hill to the Washington Redskins in exchange for Walt Yowarsky and Jim Ricca. Torgeson played for the Redskins from 1955 to 1957, appearing in 35 games. He was released by the team in September 1958. Coaching career In September 1959, Toregson announced that he was retiring as a player and had been hired as an assistant coach with the Redskins. He was with the Redskins from 1959 to 1961. In January 1962, Torgeson left the Redskins to become an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Steelers under his former Lions head coach Buddy Parker. He remained with the Steelers from 1962 to 1968. In February 1969, Torgeson was hired by the Los Angeles Rams as their defensive line coach under head coach George Allen. He remained with the Rams for the 1969 and 1970 seasons. In those two years under Allen and Torgeson, the Rams compiled a 20‚Äì7‚Äì1 record. In 1971, Allen left the Rams to become head coach of the Washington Redskins. Torgeson followed Allen and became the Rams' defensive coordinator from 1971 to 1977. During seven seasons under Allen and Torgeson, the Redskins compiled a 67‚Äì30‚Äì1 record; they won the conference title in 1972 (but lost Super Bowl VII to the Miami Dolphins in January 1973). In February 1978, Allen returned to the Los Angeles Rams, and Torgeson followed him as an assistant coach, but Allen was fired in mid-August. Torgeson remained with the Rams under newly-promoted head coach Ray Malavasi for three years, through the 1980 season. They compiled a 12‚Äì4 record in 1978, won the NFC championship in 1979 (but lost Super Bowl XIV in January 1980), and were 11‚Äì5 in 1980. In February 1981, Torgeson returned to the Redskins as defensive line coach. He remained with the Redskins for 13 years, through the 1993 season. He was an assistant under head coaches Joe Gibbs from 1981 to 1992 and Richie Petitbon in 1993. During his tenure with the Redskins, the team won Super Bowl XVII in 1983, Super Bowl XXII in 1988, and Super Bowl XXVI in 1992, and lost Super Bowl XVIII in 1984. When Norv Turner took over as head coach of the Redskins in early 1994, Torgeson and several other assistant coaches were dismissed. Torgeson concluded his coaching career as the defensive coordinator and linebacker coach for the Frankfurt Galaxy in 1996. Later years After retiring from coaching, Torgeson lived with his wife Nola (Carmichael) Torgeson in Huntington Beach, California. In 1970, he was inducted into the Washington State University Athletic Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the State of Washington Sports Hall of Fame in 1994.

The church offers services in both the English and German languages. The church was founded in 1851. History The history of First Evangelical Lutheran Church of Toronto is, above all else an account of a relatively small number of German-speaking immigrants struggling to create and maintain a spiritual home for themselves and successive generations. Not only did those first immigrants accomplish this goal, but in so doing, earned for First Lutheran the designation of the Lutheran mother church of Toronto. First Lutheran traces its beginnings to 1850 when a small number of German Lutheran families began to meet in their homes for worship. The German population of Toronto was then extremely small, no more than a few hundred, and probably equally represented by Protestants and Roman Catholics. The formal organisation of the congregation took place on August 9, 1851 when 12 members signed its first constitution. Served by itinerant pastors for the first several years of its existence, the congregation met in a number of temporary locations which included the First Congregational Church, the Crookshank Street Public School and the Temperance Hall ‚Äî all in the heart of what is now downtown Toronto. The first permanent pastor to serve the congregation, the Reverend Gustav Reiche, was appointed in 1855. In that same year, the congregation purchased the property on Bond Street where it began construction of its first church building the following year. This was a small simple wood-frame structure and included a parsonage at its western end. The completed structure was consecrated on August 23, 1857. In its first decade, the congregation was plagued by severe financial difficulties. Due to increases in building costs, the first of the European fundraising efforts took place in 1857 when a trustee of the congregation, G. van der Smissen, went to Germany and collected an amount sufficient to cover the most pressing building debts. As the financial situation had not improved by 1860, his daughter, Elizabeth van der Smissen, undertook a trip to Europe to raise funds. Using testimonials provided by clergy of other denominations in Toronto, specifically Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, and Congregationalist, Miss van der Smissen traveled to Germany, France, Switzerland, England and Scotland, and raised sufficient funds to retire the congregation's debt. A record of these testimonials and of all funds collected remains in the congregation's archives to date. The next few decades in the history of the congregation were characterized by a number of short-term tenancies of pastors, very slow growth in the size of congregation, and perennial difficulties in meeting ongoing financial obligations. Through the late 1920s, the women's group frequently provided funds to cover essential expenses when the financial situation of the congregation became desperate. In 1877, evening services in the English language were introduced for the benefit of the congregation's younger generation and their spouses who did not speak German. In 1889 a fire seriously damaged the structure, but with the insurance compensation, the damage was repaired. Four years later the parsonage at the western end of the church was rebuilt into a Sunday school hall. By 1895, it was apparent that the original church building was deteriorating and no longer adequate for the congregation which had recently experienced significant growth. An ambitious fundraising effort led by Theodore Heinzmann raised sufficient funds to construct the current more substantial sanctuary which was consecrated in 1898. Indications are that the early years of the twentieth-century were fairly successful for First Lutheran, as evidenced by the purchase of a parsonage on Carleton Street in 1902. A rift developed in the congregation shortly thereafter which resulted in a number of members leaving to form St. Paul's English Lutheran Church. This breakaway congregation met for a time at the Broadway Tabernacle at College and Spadina before building its own small church on Glen Morris in 1914. The specific nature of the dissension is not documented in any existing congregational records. Neither First Lutheran nor St. Paul's ultimately had the resources to remain viable individual congregations over time and by 1927, the membership of both had declined such that both congregations considered dissolution. Under the leadership of the Reverend Albert Grunwald, who was called in 1927, a period of renewal of First Lutheran began. A modestly-successful fundraising campaign began with the intention of selling the Bond Street structure and constructing a new sanctuary elsewhere in Toronto. In 1930, the almost inevitable merger of First Lutheran and St. Paul's took place. The facility on Glen Morris was sold to a Russian-Greek Orthodox congregation with the proceeds designated for a new church elsewhere. In 1932, the congregation realized it could not sell the Bond Street church and decided to repair and improve the church using the monies accumulated in the building fund. The improvements included outfitting the chancel with the marble altar, altar rail, offering table, chancel paneling, hand-painted mural decoration, reredos, statue of Christ, pulpit and statue canopies. Most of these remain in place to date. The congregation once again experienced renewal with the arrival of large numbers of immigrants after World War II. Not only did German-speaking immigrants find a spiritual home at First Lutheran, but it also provided a temporary home for Lutherans from a number of other countries, specifically the Finns, the Hungarians, the Latvians and the Lithuanians as they came together to establish their own congregations. In the 1970s, First Lutheran achieved a state of maturity in its ministry as it began to recognize needs and opportunities beyond the immediate Lutheran community. For several years, it supported a number of foster children in Latin America. More recently it has supported urban initiatives such as Covenant House, Fellowship of the Least Coin, Shopping Bag Ladies House and Eva's Place. And it has quite fittingly provided support for a struggling Lutheran congregation in Latin America. The character of the congregation has changed significantly over recent decades. What was at one time a large and vibrant Sunday School, about a hundred children, has diminished to a handful. The youth group is small and likely to remain so. However a large and vibrant seniors group has very closely associated with the congregation for the past twenty years. Both women's and men's groups continue to meet, serving a definite need for fellowship and to foster spiritual growth. In the last decades it also houses services for the small Hungarian Lutheran community of Toronto, one of only two Lutheran congregations remaining in North America (the other, more numerous community is located in Cleveland, Ohio). Services are held in Hungarian every other weekend by the visiting pastor of the Cleveland church.

She studied piano (first prize in piano at Conservatoire), and obtained a baccalaur√©at B, after studying for 13 years in a French religious institution, S≈ìurs de L√ºbeck. She enrolled at Panth√©on-Assas University for law studies but abandoned them and went on to become a parliamentary assistant to Ren√© Touzet. She also was a fitting model for Schiaparelli, the French fashion house, and worked for a public-relations company. Political life When her husband was a minister, C√©cilia Sarkozy had an office next to his, serving as his close adviser. In 2002, she was appointed to the Office of the Ministry of the Interior. In 2005 she was appointed Chief-of-Staff for the UMP Party. C√©cilia Sarkozy visited Libya twice in July 2007 to visit Muammar al-Gaddafi and helped in securing the release of five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor who had all spent years on Libya's death row after allegedly being tortured into confessing to infecting Libyan babies with the HIV virus.\\"Sarkozy's wife visits HIV medics\\" BBC, 13 July 2007 The French left asked for C√©cilia Sarkozy to be heard by the Parliamentary Commission expected to be created in October 2007 concerning the terms of the release of the six, as she had played an \\"important role\\" in their liberation according to Pierre Moscovici (PS).\\"France-Libye: la gauche r√©clame des explications √† C√©cilia Sarkozy\\", in Lib√©ration (with AFP), 14 August 2007 The release process is described in the book Notes from Hell from the perspective of one of the medics, Valya Cherveniashka.https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23385061-notes-from-hell Personal life C√©cilia Ciganer-Alb√©niz moved in with the popular French TV host Jacques Martin in 1983. They married on 10 August 1984. The wedding took place in Neuilly-sur-Seine at the town hall, and Nicolas Sarkozy, then the mayor of Neuilly, conducted the wedding. The Martins had two daughters, Judith Martin (b. 22 August 1984) and Jeanne-Marie Martin (b. 8 June 1987). She has a grandson, Augustin and a granddaughter Diane Elizabeth, born of her daughter Jeanne-Marie. In 1987, Sarkozy, who was married to his first wife at the time, met C√©cilia Martin again and has said he felt \\"struck by lightning\\". Other sources, however, state that Sarkozy fell in love with the bride on their wedding day. C√©cilia Martin left her husband to live with Sarkozy in 1988 and obtained a divorce three months later. Once Sarkozy had himself obtained a divorce in 1996, they married in Neuilly on 23 October 1996. The witnesses were Martin Bouygues and billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault. Six months later, on 23 April 1997, C√©cilia Sarkozy gave birth to the couple's only child, Louis. Nicolas Sarkozy had two sons from his first marriage. Nicolas Sarkozy once declared that C√©cilia Sarkozy was his \\"strength and [his] Achilles' heel\\". Nicolas Sarkozy wrote in his 2005 book, Testimony, \\"Today, C√©cilia and I are reunited for good, for real, doubtless for ever ... [W]e are not able and do not know how to separate from each other.\\" He has said his wife is his \\"true soulmate\\" and \\"the person without whom nothing I do would be possible\\". In July 2007, he said, \\"At the end of day, my only real worry is C√©cilia.\\" Rumors had circulated since Sarkozy's election as president in May 2007 that the couple had separated, and further rumors surfaced in the French media in October 2007 that they were soon expected to announce their plans to divorce. On 18 October 2007 the √âlys√©e Palace released a statement declaring that the Sarkozys ‚Äúannounce their separation by mutual consent.‚Äù Shortly afterwards, the palace corrected the separation announcement by stating that the Sarkozys had actually officially divorced. On 19 October 2007, an interview with C√©cilia Sarkozy was published on the front page of L'Est R√©publicain, a regional French newspaper. In it, she admitted that she had run away with her lover, Richard Attias, in 2005 (\\"I met someone, I fell in love, I left\\") and that though she eventually returned to Sarkozy, they were unable to repair their marriage. \\"What happened to me has happened to millions of people: one day you no longer have your place in the couple. The couple is no longer the essential thing of your life.

Glacially eroded remnants of this volcano rise above the Deming Glacier, part of the glacier system of the nearby volcano Mount Baker. There are three major peaks ‚Äî Colfax, Lincoln, and Seward ‚Äî which can all be climbed. The volcano was last active during the mid-Pleistocene from 495,000 to 288,000 years ago. Mount Baker, a much younger volcano, sits on top of lava erupted from Black Buttes Volcano.  Geography  The Black Buttes represent the remains of a large stratovolcano that once resided in the approximate location of its neighbor, Mount Baker. Black Buttes lies about from Baker, between Baker and the middle fork of Nooksack River, located in Whatcom County, in the U.S. state of Washington. The volcano reaches an elevation of . Its peaks lie next to Coleman Glacier, Thunder Glacier, and Deming Glacier. These peaks include the two principal summits, East Butte, or Colfax Peak, and West Butte, or Lincoln Peak, as well as the third major mountain crest, called Seward Peak.  Colfax Peak  Colfax Peak First climbed by David Anderson, Clarence A. Fisher, and Paul Hugdahl in 1921, Colfax Peak or East Butte, reaches an elevation of . It has a small ice cap on its eastern side, along with a hanging ice cliff on its northern flank, and it consists of extremely steep rock walls. The route up this summit traverses easy slopes, starting at the Mount Baker saddle from the Coleman Glacier Route, and running for about an hour along a lava ridge or snowslopes. The peak's northern flank was first ascended by Ed Cooper and Fergus O'Conner on May 4, 1958, and demanded ice screws. The western side of the northern flank was first climbed by Paul Johanson and S. Reilly Moss in September, 1974, close to the 1958 route, and the trail there lasts for approximately four hours.  Lincoln Peak  Lincoln Peak, south aspect Located west of Colfax Peak, Lincoln Peak, also known as West Butte, has an elevation of . It was first ascended by Fred Beckey, Wesley Grande, John Rupley, and Herb Staley on July 22, 1956. The southwestern face can be climbed, and it is accessible by following the cirque on Thunder Glacier from the Heliotrope Ridge Trail, and then rappeling. The climb is technically demanding, lasting 9 hours, and it has significant rockfall hazards. The cirque can also be accessed from Middle Fork Nooksack River Road. The least accessible of the Black Buttes summits, Lincoln Peak has a northern face as well as a -long face to the east. To the west, Lincoln Peak drops into Thunder Glacier's cirque; its southern side features gullies and ridges.  Seward Peak  Seward Peak Seward Peak has an elevation of , and it lies to the west of Lincoln Peak. First ascended by Dallas Kloke and Bryce Simon on July 11, 1973, it does not require a technical climb. Climbers are recommended to approach as though intending to climb Lincoln Peak, but instead to follow heather to the southwestern ridge before ascending a ridge to a false peak. After another of ascent, they should reach the summit of Seward Peak, the entire trip lasting about 4 hours.  Geology  Black Buttes is an extinct volcano with an amphitheater shape. It consists of jagged peaks that form an arc-shaped ridge, which were shaped and altered by glacial motion and erosion. Part of its amphitheater and its main eruptive crater is currently taken up by Deming Glacier, the rest of the volcano sitting above the glacier.  Eruptive history  Black Buttes was active during the mid-Pleistocene from 495,000 to 288,000 years ago, producing viscous, andesitic lava flows with a steep dip (the steepest angle of descent of a tilted bed or feature relative to a horizontal plane) that reach thicknesses of up to , though they were could actually be larger as they are covered by ice. Its most active eruptive period took place between 350,000 and 330,000 years ago. During the construction of its main edifice, at least four flank eruptions from satellite vents separate from its central crater generated lava flows. The first three eruptions produced andesitic flows, while the fourth and most recent event yielded lava composed of basaltic andesite. Andesite from the Lava Divide era, the first and longest eruptive period which spanned 460,000 to 296,000 years ago, probably produced a large volcanic cone, but it has now been reduced to a ridge. Lava flows made of andesite from 455,000 to 366,000 years ago were generated from a vent now buried under Mount Baker; at least two have subhorizontal columns indicating that they were settled adjacent to ice, likely from a glacier. Some of the lava flows also contain hypersthene basalt. In addition to these eruptions traced to Black Buttes, there are five lava flows in the vicinity for which geologists have failed to pinpoint the source vent. These deposits were erupted after Black Buttes went extinct, but before Mount Baker became active. They consist of rhyodacite (dated to 199,000 years ago) and basaltic andesite.  Human history  The Black Buttes were named by Edmund T. Coleman during his ascent of Mount Baker in 1868. He named Lincoln and Colfax Peaks, describing them on August 14 of that year as \\"black, jagged, splintered precipices.\\" Historian Charles Easton referred to the Black Buttes as a \\"homogenous mass of black basalt\\", comparing them to \\"a Chinese wall\\". Historically, the surveyor Thomas Gerdine called them the Sawtooth Rocks, a name which was used for a number of maps.

History The origin of the Iowa Northern Railway starts with the major portion of the Manly to Cedar Rapids line which was built in the 1870s by the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railroad, which became part of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (Rock Island RR) in 1902, and remained operated by the Rock Island until that company's bankruptcy in 1980. On August 1st, 1981 IANR operated their 1st inspection train consisting of IANR GP7 610 locomotive and a leased CNW passenger car. Next on August 7, 1981, short line service between Cedar Rapids and Vinton and from Shell Rock to Nora Springs started. By mid-1982, the operations had been connected and expanded to the present size. Iowa Northern Railway was incorporated in 1984, becoming one of the first short-line railroads in the state of Iowa and in July 1984 purchased its line from the bankrupt Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad estate for US$5.4 million. The railroad was originally owned by a group of grain elevators located along the line but was sold in 1994 to Iron Road Railways (IRR), a holding company based in Alexandria, Virginia, and Livonia, Michigan. In July 1994, IANR abandoned a branch from Vinton to Dysart, Iowa. In 2002, following the bankruptcy and dissolution of IRR, the IANR was taken over by former IRR director Daniel Sabin. Operations Iowa Northern Railway operates in Iowa between Cedar Rapids in eastern Iowa and Manly in north central Iowa. The railroad connects with the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway in Cedar Rapids; with the Canadian National Railway subsidiary Chicago Central and Pacific Railroad in Cedar Rapids and Waterloo; with the Canadian Pacific Railway subsidiary Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad) in Nora Springs; and with the Union Pacific Railroad in Manly, Waterloo, Cedar Rapids and Belmond. The Oelwein Subdivision operates over and the Garner Subdision operates over of trackage with portions of travel via incidental trackage rights. The railroad employs 100+ people, all located in Iowa. The railroad is headquartered in Waterloo, and has Customer Service and General Offices located there as well. Its Bryant Yard Shops are located in Waterloo. Traffic consists of grain, ethanol and other bio-fuels related commodities, chemicals, food products, and machinery. After the short line was established in 1984, the railroad handled 12,000 revenue cars and the average track speed was less than . In 2006, traffic surged to 40,000 revenue cars and with increases in track speed on some sections to .

The Chicago and North Western was purchased by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1995. IANR operates freight service over a line of railroad now owned by D&W; Railroad between Dewar and Oelwein and over incidental UP trackage rights between Waterloo and Dewar.

These vehicles may be used to empty the sewage tanks of buildings, aircraft lavatories, passenger train toilets and at campgrounds and marinas as well as portable toilets. The folk etymology behind the name 'honeywagon' is thought to relate to the honey-colored liquid that comes out of it when emptying the holding tanks. History The honey wagon was originally a horse-drawn vehicle that went through back alleys to collect human excreta. Houses at that time did not have flush toilets or indeed any form of indoor sanitation beyond the chamberpot. In rural areas the outhouse (privy) is associated with a pit latrine of various sorts, but many towns and cities depended on some variant of the pail closet, which needed frequent emptying. At each outdoor toilet, the driver would stop the wagon, flip up the back hatch door (trap-door) of the outhouse, slide out the pail (bucket), pick it up, and dump the contents into one of eight oak half-barrels in the wagon box. The half-barrels had no lids. These toilets were known as dunnies in Australia, hence the \\"dunnywagon\\" driven by \\"dunnymen\\". Use in film and television industry A honeywagon is a portable toilet unit used in the film and television industry. Many take the form of a specialized semi-trailer. In the UK a honeywagon usually refers to a set of toilets used by the cast and crew. These come in all shapes and sizes - either trailer-base or built into the box body of a truck. In America, the term honeywagon is usually given to a truck, trailer or combination of both with a number of dressing rooms for the actor. These either have individual toilets or a communal set built in. Some honeywagons will be just two large toilets. Others are a combination of variously sized rooms for specific purposes: these rooms can be private dressing rooms assigned to a single person, larger rooms configured for the wardrobe, or makeup departments, small individual toilets for the crew to share, and multiple user or individual shower rooms for bathing. Operation The operator connects a hose to the discharge outlet on the recreational vehicle, boat or building and pumps the waste into the wagon's holding tank. When the tank is full, the operator should empty the tank at an approved holding tank dump station or sewage lagoon.

History of the Tribunals Initially United States President George W. Bush asserted that captives taken during the \\"Global War on Terror\\": * Did not qualify for Prisoner of War status, as defined by the Geneva Conventions. * Were not entitled to the protection of having a \\"competent tribunal\\" convened, where their combatant status would be openly reviewed. This assertion was criticized by many legal scholars, and lawyers who volunteered to represent Guantanamo captives mounted legal challenges in the US Court system. The first legal challenge to be heard before the United States Supreme Court was Rasul v. Bush. The Supreme Court addressed some aspects of the case. In particular, it ruled that the Guantanamo captives were entitled to an opportunity to hear, and challenge, the allegations the DoD felt justified their continued extrajudicial detention. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the Department of Defense should convene Tribunals similar to those described in Army Regulation 190-8. Army Regulation 190-8 sets out the procedure officers of the United States armed forces should follow to determine whether captives taken during a war were: #lawful combatants, entitled to the protections of POW status. #innocent civilian refugees, who should be released immediately. #combatants who have acted in a manner that has stripped them of the protections of POW status. Duties of the Personal Representative Guantanamo captive's Personal Representatives duties included: #meeting with captive prior to their Tribunal, to explain the Combatant Status Review Tribunal procedure to them, including: #*explaining that the Tribunals were administrative procedures, not judicial procedures. #*explaining that captives were entitled to attend every Tribunal session where unclassified evidence was discusses; #*explaining that captives were not obliged to testify at their Tribunals; #*explaining that they would have an opportunity to respond to all the unclassified allegations presented at their Tribunal. #*explaining that they could call upon the testimony of any witnesses they felt could address the allegations they faced, but that their Tribunal's President would then rule whether their witnesses were relevant and reasonably available. #*explaining that they could call upon any documents they felt could address the allegations they faced, and as with their witness requests, their Tribunal's President would then rule whether those documents were relevan and reasonably available. Criticisms of the performance of the Personal Representative Andy Worthington, author of The Guantanamo Files, singled out the Personal Representatives of two captives who were notably active on their behalf.

The name comes from the surrounding Holy Mountains. Today, the monastery forms the centrepiece of the Sviatohori National Nature Park. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) proclaimed it a lavra in 2004. History The first written mention of the monastery dates from 1627, although Sigismund von Herberstein had alluded to the \\"Holy Mountains\\" area as early as 1526. It is likely that the first monks settled the area in the 15th century. At the time it was a minor monastic establishment in the Wild Fields regularly ravaged by the Crimean Tatars. In 1787, Catherine II had it shut down. The monastery's lands were secularized and donated to Prince Grigory Potemkin, the Viceroy of New Russia. One of his heirs, Aleksander Mikhailovich Potemkin, and his wife Tatiana, n√©e Princess Galitzine, financed the monastery's revival and rebuilding, starting in 1844. Before the October Revolution, the Sviatohirsk Monastery owned a worker's shop, windmills, various kinds of repair shops, and trading buildings. The lavra's main Dormition Cathedral was designed by Alexey Gornostaev, who included a traditional Byzantine tower. From 1917 onward, the Bolsheviks plundered and desecrated the monastery on numerous occasions, beating and killing many monks and in 1922, they shut the monastery down completely, setting up a Sanatorium for the Donbass workers on the grounds. Before World War I, the monastery was inhabited by approximately 600 monks. During the 1930s, some of the churches were demolished by the Soviets, along with other numerous religious sites throughout the Soviet Union. After the fall of the Soviet Union and the regaining of Ukrainian independence in 1991, the monastery was restored a year later. In 2004, the monastery was officially granted the status of a Ukrainian Orthodox Church lavra. Today, the monastery community consists of more than 100 monks, and is increasing each year.

It sets out guidelines as to when the defence will apply, and when it will not and what jury instructions (\\"directions to the jury\\" or considerations by the magistrates) should be given to leave the defence open for them to find or deny, given appropriate medical evidence and the extent of wrongfulness involved in allowing the automatism to occur in many circumstances. Facts A man succeeded in driving a great distance somewhat part-conscious before having an accident. He was charged with dangerous driving. He could not remember anything between a very early point of the journey and immediately after the accident. It was suggested (and accepted at first instance) that he was not fully conscious of what he was doing, and \\"that he was not capable of forming any intention as to his manner of driving.\\"Hill v Baxter [1958] 1 QB 277, 281. The reason for this is because he had an unknown illness, and so was not able to control his actions. Automatism As dangerous driving under the Road Traffic Act 1930 was an offence of strict liability, lack of mens rea would not be enough to exculpate him. He was instead hoping to rely on the defence of automatism, a narrow category of its own class distinct from insanity. Lord Goddard CJ ruled sometimes \\"the driver would be in such a state of unconsciousness that he could not be said to be driving.\\"Hill v Baxter [1958] 1 QB 277, 283. This is in effect a denial of actus reus. However, he found that the accused had simply fallen part-asleep. As this was something he had substantial control over, being presumed to have been aware that he was tired, he found that he was reckless in continuing to drive, he then quoted Humphreys in Kay v Butterworth (1945) and resurrected the now-famous analogy of a swarm of bees attacking the driver, in which case the driver would not have been held liable. Pearson J. agreed on all relevant points of law, but disagreed as to why he should be convicted. He held that as the man had driven a substantial distance without incident nor any recollection, he was clearly \\"driving with skill\\", and therefore must have been driving.Hill v Baxter [1958] 1 QB 277, 287. The panel held that the jury or magistrates should be advised only a voluntary act or omission can qualify as an actus reus, however driving a substantial distance during the time of alleged transience of mind or consciousness would tend towards a finding of fact of some form of voluntary act, even if simply ignoring the signs of tiredness so being unfit to drive. Outcome The prosecution's appeal was allowed, for a retrial whereby the magistrates could have a fuller understanding of the law. The defendant was then found guilty.

It is extremely adapted to a burrowing way of life. It has large, shovel-like forepaws and silky fur, which helps it move easily. It also lacks complete eyes as it has little need for them. It feeds on earthworms and larvae. History of discovery Although the southern marsupial mole was probably known by aborigines for thousands of years, the first specimen examined by the scientific community was collected in 1888. Stockman W. Coulthard made the discovery on Idracowra Pastoral Lease in the Northern Territory by following some unusual prints that lead him to the animal lying under a tussock. Not knowing what to do with the strange creature, he wrapped it in a kerosene soaked rag, placed it in a revolver cartridge box and forwarded it to E. C. Stirling, the Director of the South Australian Museum. Due to the poor transportation conditions of the time, the specimen reached its destination in a badly decomposed state. Hence, Stirling was unable to find any evidence of the pouch or epipubic bones and decided the creature was not a marsupial. Nineteenth century scientists believed that marsupials and eutherians had evolved from the same primitive ancestor and were looking for a living specimen that would serve as the missing link. Because the marsupial mole closely resembled the golden moles of Africa, some scientists concluded that the two were related and that they had found the proof. This however is not the case, as became obvious by examining better- preserved specimens that had a marsupial pouch. Taxonomy and phylogeny Although the family Notoryctidae is poorly represented in the fossil record there is evidence of at least one distinct genus Yalkaparidon, in the early Miocene sediments in the Riversleigh deposit in northern Australia. Due to their highly specialized morphology and the fact that notoryctids share many common characteristics with other marsupials, there has been much debate surrounding their phylogeny. However, recent molecular studies indicate that notoryctids are not closely related to any of the other marsupial families and should be placed in an order of their own, Notoryctemorphia. Furthermore, molecular data suggests that Notoryctemorphia separated from other marsupials around 64 million years ago. Although at this time South America, Antarctica and Australia were still joined the order evolved in Australia for at least 40-50 million years. The Riversleigh fossil material suggests that Notoryctes was already well adapted for burrowing and probably lived in the rainforest that covered much of Australia at that time. The increase in aridity at the end of Tertiary was likely one of the key contributing factors to the development of the current highly specialized form of marsupial mole. The marsupial mole had been burrowing long before the Australian deserts came into being. Morphology The southern marsupial mole is small in size, with a head and body length varying from 121 to 159 mm, a tail length of 21‚Äì26 mm and a weight of 40-70 g. The body is covered with short, dense, silky fur with a pale cream to white color often tinted by the iron oxides from the soil which gives it a reddish chestnut brown tint. It has a light brownish pink nose and mouth and no vibrissae. The cone shaped head merges directly with the body, and there is no obvious neck region. The limbs are short and powerful, and digits III and IV of the manus have large spade-like claws. The dentition varies with individuals and, because the molars have a root of only one third of the length, it has been assumed that moles cannot deal with hard food substances. The dorsal surface of the rostrum and the back of the tail have no fur and the skin is heavily keratinized. There is no external evidence of the eyes, and the optic nerve is absent. It does, however, have a pigment layer where the eyes should be, probably a vestige of the retina. Both lachrymal glands and Jacobson's organ are well developed, and it has been suggested that the former plays a role in lubricating the nasal passages and Jacobson's organ. The external ear openings are covered with fur and do not have a pinnae. The nostrils are small vertical slits right below the shield-like rostrum. Although the brain has been regarded as very primitive and represents the \\"lowliest marsupial brain\\", the olfactory bulbs and the rubercula olfactoria are very well developed. This seems to suggest that the olfactory sense plays an important role in the marsupial moles' life, as it would be expected for a creature living in an environment lacking visual stimuli. The middle ear seems to be adapted for the reception of low-frequency sounds. Adaptations The southern marsupial mole resembles the Namib Desert golden mole (Eremitalpa granti namibensis) and other specialised fossorial animals in having a low and unstable body temperature, ranging between 15-30 ¬∞C. It does not have an unusually low resting metabolic rate, and the metabolic rate of burrowing is 60 times higher than that of walking or running. Because it lives underground, where the temperature is considerably lower than at the surface, the southern marsupial mole does not seem to have any special adaptations to desert life. It is not known whether it drinks water or not, but due to the irregularity of rainfall it is assumed that it does not. Habitat and distribution The habitat of the southern marsupial mole is not well known, and is generally based on scattered records. It has been often recorded in sandy dunes or flats, usually where spinifex is present. Its habitat seems to be restricted to areas where the sand is soft, as it cannot tunnel through harder materials. Although little is known about its exact distribution, sightings, aboriginal informants and museum records indicate that it lives in the central sandy desert regions of Western Australia, northern South Australia and the Northern Territory. Recent studies indicate that its habitat also includes Great Victoria and Gibson Deserts. Behavior Due to the lack of any field studies regarding the marsupial moles, there is little known about their behavior. Observations of captive animals are limited since most of the moles do not survive more than a little over a month after capture. Surface behavior It sometimes wanders above the surface where traces of several animals have been found. While most evidence indicates that it does this seldom and moves just a few meters before burrowing back underground, on some occasions multiple tracks were found suggesting that one or more animals have moved above ground for several hours. According to Aboriginal sources, marsupial moles may surface at any time of day, but seem to prefer to do so after rain and in the cooler season. Captive animals have been observed to feed above ground and then return underground to sleep. Occasionally it has been recorded to suddenly \\"faint\\" on the surface without waking up for several hours until disturbed. Above the ground it moves in a sinuous fashion, using its powerful forelimbs to haul the body over the surface and its hind limbs to push forward. The forelimbs are extended forward in unison with the opposite hind limb. Moles move about the surface with frantic haste but little speed, as one observer once likened it to a \\"Volkswagen Beetle heaving its way through the sand\\". Burrowing behavior While burrowing, the southern marsupial mole does not make permanent tunnels, but the sand caves in and tunnels back-fill as the animal moves along. For this reason its burrowing style has been compared to \\"swimming through the sand‚Äù\\". The only way its tunnels can be identified is as a small oval shape of lose sand. Although it spends most of its active time 20-100 cm below the surface, tunneling horizontally or at shallow angles, it sometimes for no apparent reason turns suddenly and burrows vertically to depths of up to 2.5 meters. Although most food sources are likely to occur at depths of approximately 50 cm from the surface, the temperature of these environments varies greatly from less than 15¬∞C during winter to over 35¬∞C during summer. While one of the captive moles was observed shivering when the temperature dropped under 16¬∞C, it seems probable that moles can select the temperature of their environment by burrowing at different depths. Diet Little is known about the southern marsupial mole's diet, and all information is based on the gut content of preserved animals and on observations made on captive specimens. All evidence seems to suggest that the mole is mainly insectivorous, preferring insect eggs, larvae and pupae to the adults. Based on observations made on captive animals, it seems that one of the favorite food choices was beetle larvae, especially Scarabaeidae. Because burrowing requires high energy expenditure it seems unlikely that the mole searches for its food in this prey impoverished environment, and suggests that it probably feeds within nests. It has been also recorded to eat adult insects, seeds and lizards. Below the desert sands of Australia, the marsupial mole searches for burrowing insects and small reptiles. Instead of building a tunnel, it \\"swims\\" through the ground, allowing the sand to collapse behind it. Social behavior There is little known about the social and reproductive behavior of these animals, but all evidence seems to suggest that it leads a solitary life. There are no traces of large burrows where more than one individual might meet and communicate. Although it is not known how the male locates the female, it is assumed that they do so using their highly developed olfactory sense. The fact that the middle ear seems to be morphologically suited for capturing low frequency sounds, and that moles produce high pitched vocalizations when handled, indicates that this kind of sound that propagates more easily underground may be used as a form of communication. Human interactions The southern marsupial mole was known for thousands of years to the aborigines and was part of their mythology. It was associated with certain sites and dreaming trails such as Uluru and the Anangu-Pitjantjatjara Lands. Aborigines regarded the creature with sympathy, probably due to its harmless nature, and it was only eaten in hard times. Aboriginal people have good tracking skills and generally cooperate with researchers in teaching them these skills and help finding specimens. Their involvement is instrumental in gathering information about the species‚Äô habitat and behavior. Historical records suggest that the southern marsupial mole was relatively common in the late 19th century and early 20th century. There was a large trade in marsupial mole skins in the Flike River region between 1900 and 1920. Large numbers of aborigines arrived at the trading post with 5-6 pelts each for sale to trade for food and other commodities. It is estimated that hundreds to several thousand skins were traded at these meetings, and that at the time the mole was relatively common. Conservation status So little is known about the southern marsupial mole that it is difficult to assess its exact distribution and how it varied over the last decades. However circumstantial evidence suggests that their numbers are dwindling. Although the decreasing acquisition rate is difficult to interpret due to the chance nature of the findings, there are reasons for concern. About 90% of medium-sized marsupials in arid Australia have become threatened due to cat and fox predation. A recent study indicates that remains of marsupial moles have been found in 5% of the cats and foxes faecal pellets examined. Moles are also sensitive to changes in the availability of their food caused by changing fire regimes and the impact of herbivores. The southern marsupial mole is currently listed as endangered by the IUCN. Efforts to protect this species focus on advocating for maintaining a healthy population of moles to better understand their biology and behavior, and for conducting field studies to monitor the species distribution and abundance with the help of Aborigines.

It accomplishes this interconversion using three cofactors and a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical formed in a S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) activated radical reaction pathway.[1] The generalized reaction is shown below: Image:KAM Labeled reaction1.jpg  Structure  Shown on the right is the three-dimensional structure of the Lysine 2,3-aminomutase protein. The structure was determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.1 Angstrom resolution and was seen to crystallize as a homotetramer.[2] KAM was first purified and characterized in Clostridium subterminale for studies of Lysine metabolism.  Cofactors  Pyridoxal phosphate Four key cofactors are required for the reaction catalyzed by the lysine 2,3-aminomutase enzyme. They are: * S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM): Helps generate the radical intermediate by borrowing an electron. * Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP): Responsible for binding of the amino acid during reaction. The pi-system of this molecule facilitates radical delocalization during formation of an aziridinyl radical. The structure is given below: *Zinc metal: Required for coordination between the dimers in the protein. *Iron-sulfur cluster: A 4 iron-4 sulfur cluster is required for formation of a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. This radical then acts as the \\"stable\\" radical carrier in the reaction mechanism which transfers the radical to the amino acid.  Reaction Mechanism  The generalized reaction takes place in 5 steps: # Radical Formation: A \\"stable\\" radical is formed through a radical SAM mechanism in which a S-adenosyl methionine forms a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. # Enzyme Binding: Lysine 2,3-aminomutase binds to pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). # Amino Acid Binding: The amino acid (Lysine or Beta-Lysine depending on forward or reverse reactions) binds to pyridoxal phosphate. # Radical Transfer: The 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical is transferred to the amino acid and an aziridinyl radical is formed. In this configuration, the radical is stabilized by the pi- system of pyridoxal phosphate. #Amino Acid Conversion: In the final step, the new amino acid is formed and the radical is returned to its more stable state on the 5'-deoxyadenosyl.

The decision undoubtedly saved Moss' life, for Tolley, 37 players and 37 others perished on November 14, 1970 in the crash of Southern Airways Flight 932 following Marshall's loss at East Carolina. From 1960 through 1962 he was head coach of the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League. In the mid-1960s and again in the early 1980s he coached the Charleston Rockets of the semi-pro American Football Association. In 1987, Moss was hired as the head coach of the Chicago Bruisers of the Arena Football League. In 1991, he was named as first coach of the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League and compiled a record of 59‚Äì25 before leaving the team in 1997. From 1986 to 1987, Moss was the Defensive Coordinator of the University of Central Florida, where he introduced the Chicago Bears '46' Defense, enabling UCF to record its first winning season in history. The following year, Moss's Defense led UCF to its first Division I-AA play-off appearance. Moss then resigned from UCF, and thereafter began coaching Arena Football. Perry's son Les is also an American football coach. Moss is a member of the Florida Sports Hall of Fame and Arena Football Hall of Fame. On August 7, 2014, Moss died at his home in Deltona, Florida, aged 88.

Slavery had associated with it the health problems commonly associated with poverty. It was to the economic advantage of owners to keep their working slaves healthy. Those who could not work because of illness or age were sometimes abandoned by their owners, expelled from plantations, and left to fend for themselves. Life expectancy A broad and common measure of the health of a population is its life expectancy. The life expectancy in 1850 of a white person in the United States was forty; of a slave, thirty-six. Mortality statistics for whites were calculated from census data; statistics for slaves were based on small sample-sizes. Diseases among slaves West Indian physicians and authors, particularly the British, often shared their knowledge of black-related diseases with North American colleagues. Diseases that were thought to be \\"negro diseases\\" included, but were not limited to: * tetanus * nascentium, or \\"nine day fits\\" * high infant mortality * worms * diphtheria * whooping cough * cholera * typhoid * tuberculosis * influenza * hepatitis * rheumatism * \\"scabies\\" * \\"frambesia\\" (yaws) * lepra vulgaris and psoriasis * leprosy * syphilis While working on plantations in the Southern United States, many slaves faced serious health problems. Improper nutrition, unsanitary living conditions, and excessive labor made them more susceptible to diseases than their owners; the death rates among the slaves were significantly higher due to diseases. Considered today to be abuse based on pseudo-science, two alleged mental illnesses of negros were described in scientific literature: drapetomania, the mental illness that made slaves desire to run away, and dysaesthesia aethiopica, laziness or \\"rascality\\". Both were treated with whippings. Slave diet There are contrasting views on slave's diets and access to food. Some portray slaves as having plenty to eat, while others portray \\"the fare of the plantation [as] coarse and scanty\\". For the most part, slaves' diet consisted of a form of fatty pork and corn or rice. Historian U.B. Phillips found that slaves received the following standard, with little or no deviation: \\"a quart of cornmeal and half pound of salt pork per day for each adult and proportionally for children, commuted or supplemented with sweet potatoes, field peas, syrup, rice, fruit, and 'garden sass' [vegetables]\\". Scholars came to realize that the slave's diets were quantitatively satisfactory, but not qualitatively sufficient. The poor quality of food led to slaves that were either \\"physically impaired or chronically ill\\" Antebellum plantations had a larger population of hogs than cows, therefore producing more pork than beef. There are a few reasons behind having more pigs than cows: a stereotype that slaves preferred pork over beef, beef was harder to preserve so it was typically only served fresh (which happened more often in the winter because the cold slowed spoiling), a fear of fresh meat because it was believed that it caused disease among blacks (which it was probably not that fresh), and the planters' conviction that \\"hog was the only proper meat for laborers\\". Due to the lack of cattle consumption and use (other than for fertilizer), another problem arose among slaves' diets: absence of milk. There was often a stereotype in the antebellum South that slaves were lactose intolerant. However, many slaves had trouble digesting lactose (in dairy products) because it was not a common staple in their diets. Due to the scorching summer heat and the poor quality of the animals themselves, milk became a scarce product only available seasonally. When it did become available, it was first given to whites and if any remained, then to slave children. Additionally, there is some scientific hypotheses behind blacks more often being lactose intolerant than whites today. In West Africa, the presence of the tsetse fly made raising cattle practically impossible, creating a historical situation in which there was no need for humans to develop higher levels of the lactate enzyme (which allows the body to digest lactate). Due to slaves' diets lacking quality, there were many vitamin and nutrient insufficiencies that lead to sicknesses: * Vitamin A deficiency led to weakened eyesight * Lack of milk contributed to diseases such as rickets and calcium deficiency * Inadequate iron led to anemia Clothing The masters only gave slaves pairs of \\"gator shoes\\" or \\"brogans\\" for footwear, and sometimes children and adults who were not working had to walk around barefoot. These clothes and shoes were insufficient for field work; they did not last very long for field slaves. It is judged that the health of male workers broke down rapidly after they joined the field gangs. Medical attentions Slave masters often tried to cure their ill slaves before they sent the slaves to a doctor. Planters wishing to save money relied on their own self-taught skills and the help of their wives to address the health care needs of slaves. Some blacks developed or retained from African heritage their own brand of care, complete with special remedies, medical practitioners and rituals. If the home treatment did not help to improve the slave's condition, they would then send them to the physician or asked the doctor to come to the plantation. A slave who became ill meant loss of working time; death an even greater loss. Given the cost of slaves and their importance to plantation economies, planters organized slave hospitals to treat their serious health problems.Stephen C. Kenny; \\"A Dictate of Both Interest and Mercy\\"? Slave Hospitals in the Antebellum South. J Hist Med Allied Sci 2010; 65 (1): 1-47. doi: 10.1093/jhmas/jrp019 There were also separate physicians for slaves and whites because it was believed that slaves' bodies were fundamentally different from whites'. Due to this thinking, many slaves became the subjects of physician's experimental interests to help expand both the physician's knowledge and reputation, often resulting in slave's mutilation and death. Slave hospitals Slave hospitals were thought to be an essential part of plantation life by Dr. A.P. Merrill and Dr. Samuel A. Cartwright. The physicians believed that the slaves' bodies were biologically and physiologically different than whites, therefore they should have their own resource for medical attention and treatment. In some histories of the antebellum South, like William Scarborough's Masters of the Big House (2006), slave holders are depicted as going to great lengths to protect the health of their slaves. Examples of this include vaccinating slave infants against smallpox, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical expenses, and dispensing sherry or madeira wine to sick slaves. Dr. Merrill provides a detailed description of what he thought slave hospitals should be like in an 1853 article about plantation hygiene. However, in reality, the hospitals were representations of the way slaves were viewed: as chattel. They were often a slave cabin used to isolate those with a fever or illness, and to make sure that the slave was not faking an illness in an attempt to run away. Frances Kemble's recollection of the slave infirmary at Butler Island, Georgia, paints a stark reality of slave women lying on the floor in \\"tattered and filthy blankets\\".Frances Anne Kemble, Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838‚Äì1839 (1863; New York: Meridian, 1975), 69‚Äì70. For similar observations, see testimony of the Reverend Dr. Channing of Boston recalling his residence in Virginia and a visit to a very rudimentary plantation hospital, in Timothy Dwight Weld, American Slavery as It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses (1839; New York: Arno Press reprint, 1969), 44. More commonly, slaves that actually made it to an infirmary off of the plantation were subjected to physician's active experimentation and research.  Experimentation  Southern medical education's predisposition for use of black bodies to teach anatomy and be subjects of clinical experiments was dangerous and invasive and led to a major distrust of white physicians among slaves. The exploitation of slave's bodies for medical knowledge created a horrific doctor-patient relationship that involved a third party: the slave owner. This relationship often left the slave voiceless and deemed \\"medically incompetent\\", therefore taking control of their own bodies away from them. = Gynecology = A major field of experimentation that involved slaves was gynecology under Dr. J. Marion Sims in Montgomery, Alabama between 1845 and 1849. Dr. Sims is known for being a pioneer in the treatment of clubfoot, advances in \\"women's medicine\\", his role in the founding of the Women's Hospital in New York, and as the \\"father of American gynecology\\". Sims routinely operated on nine slave women, of which only three are known: Anarcha, Betsy, and Lucy. The purpose of the operations was to try and fix conditions called vesico-vaginal fistula and recto-vaginal fistula, i.e. a tear in the vaginal wall resulting in chronic leakage from the bladder or colon. These conditions were common results of childbirth during Sims' time. However, these conditions do not include symptoms of chronic pain, just discomfort and most likely embarrassment, suggesting that Sims was exaggerating their conditions to gain a competitive edge over his colleagues. Betsy, Anarcha, and Lucy survived multiple attempts to fix their condition, and although Sims was able to close the fistula, small perforations remained after healing, leakage continued, and often the sutures became infected. It was not until after the thirtieth surgery that Sims was successful on Anarcha. During these surgeries, the women were not under anesthesia, only an ineffective opium that resulted in constipation and nausea instead of anesthetic. After the success of Anarcha, many white women came to Sims to have the procedure, yet none of them endured a single operation, noting the intense pain associated with the surgery. = Other = Dr. Sims also performed other surgical experimentations on slaves, including facial operations.James Marion Sims, \\"Osteo-Sarcoma of the Lower Jaw‚ÄîResection of the Body of the Bone. Cure,\\" Am. J. Med. Sci., 1846, 7:21, 128‚Äì32; \\"Removal of the Superior Maxilla for a Tumour of the Antrum; Apparent Cure. Return of the Disease. Second Operation. Sequel,\\" Am. J. Med. Sci., 1847, 13:26, 310‚Äì15. The term \\"heroic\\" generally refers to major operations undertaken in the era before anaesthesia or antisepsis. Slave owners came to Sims in last attempt efforts to save their investments. One particular case that was published in the American Journal of Medical Sciences involved a slave named Sam whose owner thought he had a gumboil on his face that was a result of syphilis medication. Surgery was attempted on Sam before by another physician, but was unsuccessful because \\"at the first incision‚Ä¶Sam had leaped from is chair and absolutely refused to submit to further cutting\\". Sims knew of the attempted surgery and was \\"determined not to be foiled in the attempt\\" of his own. Sims attempted to dissect the patient's jaw-bone over the course of a forty-minute operation. In this time, Sims removed a tooth to make room and after unsuccessful attempts with a \\"small, long, narrow saw\\" and \\"Liston's bone forceps\\", Sims resorted to the chain-saw to remove the diseased bone. Infirmaries, like Sims', allowed physicians to be successful businessmen in the slavery-based Southern economy, but also to create professional reputations as clinical medical researchers.

Career in football Baggott represented the Richmond Football Club between 1927 and 1935. He was Richmond's leading goal kicker in his debut year of 1927 with 37 goals, and again in 1928 with 61 goals. In Round 9 of the 1928 season he kicked a then club record 12 goals against South Melbourne, the first Richmond player to ever hit double figures in goal-kicking in a game. He placed third in the League's best and fairest award, the Brownlow Medal in that same year, and was also named in the Victorian state representative team in both 1928 and 1929. Baggot represented the club in several Grand Finals, including the 1932 and 1934 Premiership teams. By that stage Baggott was playing as an attacking half-back flanker, and was named in Richmond's best in both these Grand Final victories. At the end of 1935 Baggott left Richmond to take on the role of captain-coach of the rival Essendon Football Club, starting in the 1936 season. He wound up his playing career during the 1937 season, at which point he handed over the captaincy to Keith Forbes, but continued coaching Essendon for several more seasons. An ongoing lack of success saw him replaced by legendary Essendon player and coach Dick Reynolds six games into the 1939 season. Baggott was then appointed as senior coach of the South Melbourne Football Club in 1940, but again achieved little success in with the Swans and was replaced at the end of that season. Baggott later returned to Richmond and played a key role in forming the club's 'Former Players and Officials‚Äô Association'. In 1960 he was made a life member of the Richmond Football Club. In 2019 Baggott was posthumously inducted into the Richmond 'Hall of Fame', with the award being accepted on his behalf by his nephew. Personal life Baggott was born in Pietermaritzburg, Natal (now South Africa) of Australian parents. The family returned to Australia while Baggott was a young boy.

Professional baseball Gerhardt played five seasons in Louisville, Kentucky, for the Grays (1876‚Äì77), Eclipse (1883‚Äì84) and Colonels (1891), and five seasons in New York City for the Mutuals (1875), Giants (1885‚Äì87), Metropolitans (1887) and Gladiators (1890). Across all 15 major league seasons, he appeared in 1,078 games, 893 as a second baseman, 85 as a third baseman, 63 as a first baseman, and 33 as a shortstop. Gerhardt was a weak hitter, compiling a .227 career batting average, but he was known as one of the best defensive second baseman of his era. He twice led his league in assists at any position and regularly ranked among the league leaders in putouts. double plays and fielding percentage by a second baseman between 1877 and 1890. His career range factor of 6.46 remains the highest in major league history for a second baseman. He also ranks eighth among all second basemen in major league history with 558 errors at second base. In a 1922 story on Gerhardt, New York sports writer John M. Foster compared Gerhardt to baseball's other great second basemen and concluded: \\"None had anything on Move Em Up Joe Gerhardt.\\" Gerhardt became a player- manager on two occasions: in 1883, for the Louisville Colonels, and in 1890, for the St. Louis Browns. His managerial record totaled 72 wins against 61 losses. Gerhardt's nickname, \\"Move 'Em Up Joe\\" came from his war cry, \\"Move 'em up\\", which he would shout from the bench or base line when his teammates were on base. Gerhardt was an early advocate of the sacrifice play to move base runners forward. Upon Gerhardt's death, New York sports writer John M. Foster went so far as to call Gerhardt the \\"original inventor of the sacrifice theory in baseball.\\" Later years Grave of Joe Gerhardt (lower right), in the Gerhardt family plot at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

It has been called \\"one of Massinger's best dramas,\\"Ward, Vol. 2, p. 275. and \\"a masterpiece of dramatic construction.\\"Patterson, p. 102. A play titled The Great Duke was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 5 July 1627; the scholarly consensus interprets this as referring to Massinger's play. Topical allusions in the text have been read as indicating a date of authorship between October 1623 and March 1625.Logan and Smith, p. 109. The play was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre, and was published in quarto in 1636 by the bookseller John Marriot; Massinger dedicated the work to one of his patrons, Sir Robert Wiseman,Wiseman was the eldest son (out of fourteen children) of a wealthy London goldsmith who had acquired large country estates in Essex. in gratitude for his \\"supportment and protection.\\" The quarto includes two commendatory poems, one by John Ford. Massinger is thought to have based his plot on the traditional story of Ethelwald and Elfrida, available to him in several versions; he may also have been influenced by an earlier play, A Knack to Know a Knave.Adams, p. 605. The play had no other publications or revival productions in its own era or in subsequent generations ‚Äî somewhat surprisingly, since critics have tended to regard it highly. Algernon Charles Swinburne called it \\"remarkable even among Massinger's works for elegance and grace of execution;\\"Quoted in Garrett, p. 210. William Gifford, in his edition of Massinger's works, wrote that \\"It is impossible not to be charmed with the manner in which this play is written.\\" In the play, Massinger exploits the richness of a courtly style, full of \\"gay flourishes of language\\" (Act IV, scene ii), perhaps more successfully than in any other of his works. Though generally classified as a tragicomedy, there is nothing tragic and little serious in it; the play can just as correctly be called a comedy of manners. Synopsis Massinger based the play's titular character on Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, though in a loose and ahistorical manner. In the play, Duke \\"Cozimo\\" is a childless widower who intends to leave his dukedom to his nephew Giovanni, the son of his late sister. (The actual Cosimo I had eleven children, including one named Giovanni; and there are several other Giovanni de' Medicis is the historical record.) At the start of the play, Cozimo's nephew and heir Giovanni has spent several years living at the country house of his tutor, Carolo Charomonte, where he has pursued academic subjects as well as all the training suitable for a youth of his social position ‚Äî music, horsemanship, swordsmanship and the like. He has also nourished a close friendship with Charomonte's young daughter and only child Lidia, who is a paragon of female virtues‚Äîbeautiful, intelligent, chaste, and modest. Now, however, Giovanni has been called back to the Duke's court; he takes a sad leave of his tutor and Lidia and travels to Florence with his servant Calandrino. The court is abuzz with the praises of Cozimo's favorite Count Sanazarro, who has just won a naval victory over the Ottoman fleet, the most recent of Sanazarro's many triumphs and distinctions. Sanazarro is specially favored by Cozimo's ward Fiorinda, who when she reaches her maturity will be the duchess of Urbino; Fiorinda goes so far as to give Sanazarro a diamond ring as a token of her regard. When Giovanni arrives, he requests that Fiorinda seek the Duke's permission to bring Lidia to court as one of her ladies in waiting. Other courtiers praise Lidia to the Duke; and Cozimo suspects that there may be a romantic connection between Giovanni and Lidia. This is not to his liking; the hint is that Cozimo may be planning a dynastic marriage between Giovanni and Fiorinda. Cozimo sends Sanazarro to Charomonte's country house to evaluate the young woman who may complicate his plans. Sanazarro meets Lidia‚Äîand instantly falls in love with her. This is problematical, however; Sanazarro suspects that Cozimo is curious about Lidia because the Duke is thinking of marrying the girl himself. Back in Florence, Sanazarro shares his fears with Giovanni; neither of the young men welcomes the prospect of Cozimo marrying Lidia‚Äîand together they decide to mislead the Duke and dispraise Lidia to Cozimo. No sooner are they done running her down, however, than Fiorinda seeks out the Duke to fulfill her promise to Giovanni: she solicits permission to bring Lidia to the court, and in the process repeats all of Giovanni's lush praise of her. Cozimo is irate at the young men's patent attempt at manipulation; he decides to meet Lidia in person. Cozimo travels to Charomonte's house with his courtiers, including Giovanni and Sanazarro; the increasingly desperate young men try to pass off a drunken serving woman as Lidia, and the Duke is temporarily fooled...only to become suspicious again after conversing with Charomonte. He meets Lidia himself, and realizes the hoodwinking that his heir and his favorite have tried to put over on him. They are quickly arrested and locked away in Charomonte's custody. Sanazarro, shocked at his sudden fall, obtains a loose pane of glass from a window and inscribes a plea for Fiorinda's help on it, using the diamond ring she gave him; he manages to drop the glass message so that she finds it. In the closing scene's climactic confrontation, the young men express their regret at their deception and the young women plead for the Duke's forgiveness. Cozimo is reminded of his private vow to live in single widowerhood after the death of his beloved duchess; and he forgives the young men and allows the marriages of Giovanni with Lidia and Sanazarro with Fiorinda. The play's quotient of broad comedy is supplied by Giovanni's servant Calandrino and the servants of Charomonte's household. NotesSources * Adams, William Davenport. A Dictionary of the Drama.

It was first published in 1805 in German translation by Goethe, but the French manuscript used had subsequently disappeared. The German version was translated back into French by de Saur and Saint-Geni√®s and published in 1821. The first published version based on French manuscript appeared in 1823 in the Bri√®re edition of Diderot's works. Modern editions are based on the complete manuscript in Diderot's own hand found by Georges Monval, the librarian at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in 1890, while buying music scores from a second-hand bookshop in Paris.The Literary EncyclopediaAndrew S. Curran, Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely, Other Press, 2019, p. 196-8 Monval published his edition of the manuscript in 1891. Subsequently, the manuscript was bought by the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. According to Andrew S. Curran, Diderot did not publish the dialogue during his lifetime because his portrayals of famous musicians, politicians and financiers would have warranted his arrest.Andrew S. Curran, Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely, Other Press, 2019, p. 195-6 Description The recounted story takes place in the Caf√© de la R√©gence, where Moi (\\"Me\\"), a narrator-like persona (often mistakenly supposed to stand for Diderot himself), describes for the reader a recent encounter he's had with the character Lui (\\"Him\\"), referring to‚Äîyet not literally meaning‚ÄîJean-Fran√ßois Rameau, the nephew of the famous composer,Andrew S. Curran, Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely, Other Press, 2019, p. 189-190 who's engaged him in an intricate battle of wits, self-reflexivity, allegory and allusion. Lui defends a worldview based on cynicism, hedonism and materialism.Andrew S. Curran, Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely, Other Press, 2019, p. 193-4 Recurring themes in the discussion include the Querelle des Bouffons (the French/Italian opera battle), education of children, the nature of genius and money. The often rambling conversation pokes fun at numerous prominent figures of the time. In the prologue that precedes the conversation, the first-person narrator frames Lui as eccentric and extravagant, full of contradictions, \\"a mixture of the sublime and the base, of good sense and irrationality\\". Effectively being a provocateur, Lui seemingly extols the virtues of crime and theft, raising love of gold to the level of a religion. Moi appears initially to have a didactic role, while the nephew (Lui) succeeds in conveying a cynical, if perhaps immoral, vision of reality. According to Andrew S. Curran, the main themes of this work are the consequences of god's inexistence for the possibility of morality and the distinction between human beings and animals.Andrew S. Curran, Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely, Other Press, 2019, p. 192 Michel Foucault, in his Madness and Civilization, saw in the ridiculous figure of Rameau's nephew a kind of exemplar of a uniquely modern incarnation of the Buffoon. Summary=Preface The narrator has made his way to his usual haunt on a rainy day, the Caf√© de la R√©gence, France's chess mecca, where he enjoys watching such masters as Philidor or Legall. He is accosted by an eccentric figure: I do not esteem such originals. Others make them their familiars, even their friends. Such a man will draw my attention perhaps once a year when I meet him because his character offers a sharp contrast with the usual run of men, and a break from the dull routine imposed by one's education, social conventions and manners. When in company, he works as a pinch of leaven, causing fermentation and restoring each to his natural bend. One feels shaken and moved; prompted to approve or blame; he causes truth to shine forth, good men to stand out, villains to unmask. Then will the wise man listen and get to know those about him.Translated from Rameau's Nephew Dialogue The dialogue form allows Diderot to examine issues from widely different perspectives. The character of Rameau's nephew is presented as extremely unreliable, ironical and self-contradicting, so that the reader may never know whether he is being sincere or provocative. The impression is that of nuggets of truth artfully embedded in trivia. A parasite in a well-to-do family, Rameau's nephew has recently been kicked out because he refused to compromise with the truth. Now he will not humble himself by apologizing. And yet, rather than starve, shouldn't one live at the expense of rich fools and knaves as he once did, pimping for a lord? Society does not allow the talented to support themselves because it does not value them, leaving them to beg while the rich, the powerful and stupid poke fun at men like Buffon, Duclos, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Voltaire, D'Alembert and Diderot. The poor genius is left with but two options: to crawl and flatter or to dupe and cheat, either being repugnant to the sensitive mind. If virtue had led the way to fortune, I would either have been virtuous or pretended to be so like others; I was expected to play the fool, and a fool I turned myself into. History In Rameau's Nephew, Diderot attacked and ridiculed the critics of the Enlightenment, but he knew from past experience that some of his enemies were sufficiently powerful to have him arrested or the work banned. Diderot had done a spell in prison in 1749 after publishing his Lettre sur les aveugles (Letter about the Blind) and his Encyclop√©die had been banned in 1759. Prudence, therefore, may have dictated that he showed it only to a select few. After the death of Diderot, a copy of the manuscript was sent to Russia, along with Diderot's other works.Andrew S. Curran, Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely, Other Press, 2019, p. 196 In 1765, Diderot had faced financial difficulties, and the Empress Catherine the Great of Russia had come to his help by buying out his library. The arrangement was quite a profitable one for both parties, Diderot becoming the paid librarian of his own book collection, with the task of adding to it as he saw fit, while the Russians enjoyed the prospect of one day being in possession of one of the most selectively stocked European libraries, not to mention Diderot's papers.Catherine and Diderot , consulted December 16, 2007The Russian National Library owns a unique collection of papers and books from Diderot's library. An appreciative Russian reader communicated the work to Schiller, who shared it with Goethe who translated it into German in 1805. The first published French version was actually a translation back into French from Goethe's German version. This motivated Diderot's daughter to publish a doctored version of the manuscript. In 1890, the librarian Georges Monval found a copy of Rameau's Nephew by Diderot's own hand while browsing the bouquinistes along the Seine. This complete version is now in a vault in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City.Andrew S. Curran, Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely, Other Press, 2019, p. 196-8.

Andrea caused large waves and tropical-storm force winds along the southeast coast of the United States. The first named storm and the first subtropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Andrea developed out of a non-tropical low on May 9 about 150 miles (240 km) northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida, three weeks before the official start of the season. After encountering dry air and strong vertical wind shear, Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression on May 10 while remaining nearly stationary, and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11. Andrea's remnant was subsequently absorbed into another extratropical storm on May 14. Andrea was the first pre-season storm to develop since Tropical Storm Ana in April 2003. Additionally, the storm was the first Atlantic named storm in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981. The storm produced rough surf along the coastline from Florida to North Carolina, causing beach erosion and some damage. In some areas, the waves eroded up to 20 feet (6 m) of beach, leaving 70 homes in danger of collapse. Offshore North Carolina, high waves of 34 feet (10 m) and tropical-storm-force winds damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard, although all nine sustained injuries. Light rainfall was also reported in some coastal locations. Damage was minimal, but six people drowned as a result of the storm.  Meteorological history  In early May, an upper-level trough dropped southward through the western Atlantic Ocean, forcing a back-door cold front‚Äîa cold front that moves southwestward ahead of a building surface ridge to its north or northeast‚Äîsouthward. For several days, forecast models had anticipated for the trough to evolve into a closed low pressure area, and on May 6, a frontal low with a large and well-defined circulation developed about 90 miles (140 km) east of Cape Hatteras. The low maintained scattered convection around its circulation center, and in conjunction with the strong high pressure to its north, a very tight pressure gradient produced gale-force winds near the coastline. The extratropical storm tracked southeastward and later turned to the southwest while steadily deepening; on May 7, it attained hurricane-force winds. With a lack of tropical moisture, its corresponding convection was minimal and scattered. The National Hurricane Center first mentioned the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis on May 8, while the storm was located about 230 miles (370 km) east-southeast of the South Carolina coastline. Its associated convection had steadily increased as it tracked slowly westward at 5‚Äì10 mph (8‚Äì16 km/h). The system changed little in organization throughout the day, though by the following morning, hurricane specialists indicated the low was acquiring subtropical characteristics as it tracked over progressively warmer waters. Early on May 9, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system revealed winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) and a flat thermal core, which indicated the system was neither warm-core nor cold-core. In addition, satellite imagery indicated a consolidation of the convection near the center, as well as hints of upper-level outflow and a contraction of the radius of maximum winds from more than 115 miles (185 km) to about 70 miles (120 km). Based on the observations and the hybrid structure of the system, the National Hurricane Center classified the low as Subtropical Storm Andrea at 1500 UTC on May 9 about 150 miles (240 km) northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida. During a subsequent analysis of the storm, researchers estimated that the storm had transitioned into a subtropical cyclone nine hours earlier. As Andrea developed before June 1‚Äîthe traditional start of hurricane seasons in the Atlantic Ocean‚Äîit became the first pre-season storm since Tropical Storm Ana in April 2003\\\\. Additionally, the storm was the first Atlantic named storm in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981\\\\. A satellite animation of the formation of Subtropical Storm Andrea, as seen in water-vapor imagery Upon first becoming a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was embedded within a large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures of no more than 77 ¬∞ F (25 ¬∞C), the organization of the system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500 UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18 hours about 80 miles (125 km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. Later on May 11, convection re-fired over the center as the system drifted south-southeastward, though it lacked sufficient organization to qualify as a tropical cyclone. By May 12, shower activity had organized greatly to the east of the center, and the National Hurricane Center remarked that a small increase in convection would result in the formation of a tropical depression. It accelerated east-northeastward away from the continental United States without redeveloping, and after passing over cooler waters, the remnants of Andrea merged with an approaching cold front on May 14.  Preparations  Due to rough surf from the precursor low, local National Weather Service offices issued a High Surf Advisory for much of the coastline from Florida through North Carolina. Upon first becoming a subtropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch from the mouth of the Altamaha River in Georgia southward to Flagler Beach, Florida. The watch was discontinued after Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression. Additionally, a gale warning was issued for much of the South Carolina coastline. At Isle of Palms in South Carolina, workers and dozens of firefighters prepared sandbags in preparation for high tide after waves from the storm previously caused moderate beach erosion. As a precaution, officials there intentionally cut power and gas to multiple uninhabited buildings. Officials closed schools in Dare County, North Carolina due to the threat for high winds from the storm. The North Carolina Department of Transportation also canceled ferry transportation to and from Ocracoke and Knotts Island, North Carolina.  Impact  Subtropical Storm Andrea shortly after being classified on May 9 Prior to becoming a subtropical cyclone, the low produced gale-force winds and dangerous surf near the coast from North Carolina through Georgia, and later along the coast of Florida. Significant swells were also reported in the Bahamas. The waves caused beach erosion and washed up against coastal houses along the southeast coast of the United States.  Southeastern U.S.  Off the coast of North Carolina, the storm produced 34-foot (10-m) waves and storm force winds which damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard. All nine were injured to some degree; three endured hypothermia, one received a broken rib, and one Coast Guardsman experienced back injuries from the surf. Another boat and its four occupants were reported missing, and after twelve days they remain missing. Rough waves from the precursor low left two kayakers missing near Seabrook Island, South Carolina. One was found the next day, and the other was found dead a week later. Onshore, winds reached 52 mph (84 km/h) in Norfolk, Virginia, with an unofficial report of 57 mph (92 km/h) near Virginia Beach. Similar observations occurred along the Outer Banks, with the winds knocking some tree limbs onto power lines; some isolated power outages were reported. Wind damage included some roofs losing shingles from the winds. In Elizabeth City, North Carolina, an outer rainband dropped 0.5 inches (10 mm) of precipitation in about two hours as well as several lightning strikes; one bolt of lightning injured two firefighters. The winds covered portions of North Carolina Highway 12 with sand, and for a day the route was closed after waves from the storm washed out about 200 feet (60 m) of roadway. In some locations, the waves eroded up to 20 feet (6 m) of beach, leaving 70 homes in imminent danger. On St. Simons Island in Georgia, the storm produced a storm tide of 8.09 feet (2.43 m). Trace amounts of rainfall occurred in the southeastern portion of the state.  Florida  In Florida, waves of over 10 feet (3 m) in height capsized a boat near Lantana; the two occupants were rescued without injury. Additionally, the waves displaced a sailboat that had previously been washed ashore in Juno Beach. Large waves flooded a parking lot and destroyed several fences and tree branches at Jupiter Beach, which resulted in its temporary closure; nearby a maintenance shed was destroyed. Eight leatherback sea turtle nests in Boca Raton were destroyed after the surf reached the dunes. Due to high surf, the beach pier at Flagler Beach was closed for about a day. Minor to moderate beach erosion caused the Florida Department of Transportation to fill in areas near the seawall with sand. One death occurred when a surfer drowned in the rough waves off the coast at New Smyrna Beach in Volusia County. Outer rainbands produced light rainfall, with the highest report in the Jacksonville National Weather Service area of responsibility totaling 0.77 inches (20 mm); the bands also caused tropical storm force wind gusts in the northeastern portion of the state. The winds spread smoke from local brush fires through the Tampa Bay area to Miami. High winds from Andrea were reported as fueling severe wildfires in northern Florida and southern Georgia.

Although Shen was previously a highly renowned government official and military general, he compiled this enormous written work while virtually isolated on his lavish garden estate near modern-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province. He named the book after the name he gave to his estate, the \\"Dream Brook\\". The literal translated meaning is Brush Talks from a Dream Brook, and Shen Kuo is quoted as saying:in his biography in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography (New York 1970‚Äì1990)  History  As the historian Chen Dengyuan points out, much of Shen Kuo's written work was probably purged under the leadership of minister Cai Jing (1046‚Äì1126).Sivin, III, 44. For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.Sivin, III, 44‚Äì45. The Dream Pool Essays was first quoted in a Chinese written work of 1095 AD, showing that even towards the end of Shen's life his final book was becoming widely printed. The book was originally 30 chapters long, yet an unknown Chinese author's edition of 1166 AD edited and reorganized the work into 26 chapters.Sivin, III, 45. There is one surviving copy of this 1166 edition housed now in Japan, while a Chinese reprint was produced in 1305 as well. In 1631 another edition was printed, but it was heavily reorganized into three broad chapters.  Recent translations  * English: Brush Talks from Dream Brook (two volumes) is the first complete translation of Meng Xi Bi Tan („ÄäÊ¢¶Ê∫™Á¨îË∞à„Äã) by Wang Hong and Zhao Zheng, published in 2008 by Sichuan People‚Äôs Publishing House, China. * Modern Vernacular Chinese: Zhang Jiaju's biographical work Shen Kuo (1962) contains selected translations of the Dream Pool Essays from Middle Chinese. * English: Various volumes of Joseph Needham's Science and Civilization in China series, from 1954 onwards, contain the large amount of selected English translations from the Dream Pool Essays. * French: Quoted excerpts from the Dream Pool Essays were printed in the written work of J.

Quotes = Geological theory  With Shen's writings on fossils, geomorphology, and shifting geographical climates, he states in the following passages: > In the Zhi-ping reign period [1064‚Äì67 AD] a man of Zezhou was digging a well > in his garden, and unearthed something shaped like a squirming serpent, or > dragon. He was so frightened by it that he dared not touch it, but after > some time, seeing that it did not move, he examined it and found it to be > stone. The ignorant country people smashed it, but Zheng Boshun, who was > magistrate of Jincheng at the time, got hold of a large piece of it on which > scale-like markings were to be seen exactly like those on a living creature. > Thus a serpent or some kind of marine snake (chhen) had certainly been > turned to stone, as happens with the 'stone-crabs'.Needham, Volume 3, > 618.Chan, 15. > In recent years [cca. 1080] there was a landslide on the bank of a large > river in Yong-ning Guan near Yanzhou. The bank collapsed, opening a space of > several dozens of feet, and under the ground a forest of bamboo shoots was > thus revealed. It contained several hundred bamboo with their roots and > trunks all complete, and all turned to stone...Now bamboos do not grow in > Yanzhou. These were several dozens of feet below the present surface of the > ground, and we do not know in what dynasty they could possibly have grown. > Perhaps in very ancient times the climate was different so that the place > was low, damp, gloomy, and suitable for bamboos. On the Jin-hua Shan in > Wuzhou there are stone pine-cones, and stones formed from peach kernels, > stone bulrush roots, stone fishes, crabs, and so on, but as these are all > (modern) native products of that place, people are not very surprised at > them. But these petrified bamboos appeared under the ground so deep, though > they are not produced in that place today. This is a very strange > thing.Needham, Volume 3, 614. Astronomy When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the sun and moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained his reasoning for the former: > If they were like balls they would surely obstruct each other when they met. > I replied that these celestial bodies were certainly like balls. How do we > know this? By the waxing and waning of the moon. The moon itself gives forth > no light, but is like a ball of silver; the light is the light of the sun > (reflected). When the brightness is first seen, the sun(-light passes > almost) alongside, so the side only is illuminated and looks like a > crescent. When the sun gradually gets further away, the light shines > slanting, and the moon is full, round like a bullet. If half of a sphere is > covered with (white) powder and looked at from the side, the covered part > will look like a crescent; if looked at from the front, it will appear > round. Thus we know that the celestial bodies are spherical. When the director of the astronomical observatory asked Shen Kuo why eclipses occurred only on an occasional basis while in conjunction and opposition once a day, Shen Kuo wrote: > I answered that the ecliptic and the moon's path are like two rings, lying > one over the other, but distant by a small amount. (If this obliquity did > not exist), the sun would be eclipsed whenever the two bodies were in > conjunction, and the moon would be eclipsed whenever they were exactly in > position. But (in fact) though they may occupy the same degree, the two > paths are not (always) near (each other), and so naturally the bodies do not > (intrude) upon one another.Needham, Volume 3, 415‚Äì416. On the use of the sighting tube to fix the position of the pole star, Shen Kuo wrote: > Before Han times it was believed that the pole star was in the center of the > sky, so it was called Jixing (Summit star). Zu Geng(-zhi) found out with the > help of the sighting tube that the point in the sky which really does not > move was a little more than 1 degree away from the summit star. In the > Xining reign-period (1068‚Äì1077) I accepted the order of the emperor to take > charge of the Bureau of the Calendar. I then tried to find the true pole by > means of the tube. On the very first night I noticed that the star which > could be seen through the tube moved after a while outside the field of > view. I realized, therefore, that the tube was too small, so I increased the > size of the tube by stages. After three months' trials I adjusted it so that > the star would go round and round within the field of view without > disappearing. In this way I found that the pole star was distant from the > true pole somewhat more than 3 degrees. We used to make the diagrams of the > field, plotting the positions of the star from the time when it entered the > field of view, observing after nightfall, at midnight, and early in the > morning before dawn. Two hundred of such diagrams showed that the 'pole > star' was really a circumpolar star. And this I stated in my detailed report > to the emperor.Needham, Volume 3, 262. Movable type printing On the methods of Bi Sheng's invention of movable type printing between the years 1041 to 1048 AD, Shen Kuo wrote: > [Bi Sheng] took sticky clay and cut in it characters as thin as the edge of > a coin. Each character formed, as it were, a single type. He baked them in > the fire to make them hard. He had previously prepared an iron plate and he > had covered his plate with a mixture of pine resin, wax, and paper ashes. > When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. > In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, > the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to > warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth > board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as > even as a whetstone. If one were to print only two or three copies, this > method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or > thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms > going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was > being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was > finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and > the printing was done with great rapidity.Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 201. Personal beliefs and philosophy Of Taoism and the inability of empirical science to explain everything in the world, Shen Kuo wrote: > Those in the world who speak of the regularities underlying the phenomena, > it seems, manage to apprehend their crude traces. But these regularities > have their very subtle aspect, which those who rely on mathematical > astronomy cannot know of. Still even these are nothing more than traces. As > for the spiritual processes described in the [Book of Changes] that \\"when > they are stimulated, penetrate every situation in the realm,\\" mere traces > have nothing to do with them.

What I have called the subtlest aspect of these > traces, those who discuss the celestial bodies attempt to know by depending > on mathematical astronomy; but astronomy is nothing more than the outcome of > conjecture.Ropp, 170. Dissertation on the Timberwork Manual Below are two passages from Shen's book outlining the basics contained in Yu Hao's Timberwork Manual. Yu Hao was a Chinese architect of the earlier 10th, and Kuo was one to praise his work. In the first quote, Shen Kuo describes a scene where Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan architect about slanting struts for diagonal wind bracing: > When Mr. Qian (Wei-yan) was Governor of the two Zhejiang provinces, he > authorized the building of a wooden pagoda at the Fan-tian Si (Brahma-Heaven > Temple) in Hangzhou with a design of twice three stories. While it was under > construction General Chhien went up to the top and was worried because it > swayed a little. But the Master-Builder explained that as the tiles had not > yet been put on, the upper part was still rather light, hence the effect. So > then they put on all the tiles, but the sway continued as before. Being at a > loss what to do, he privately sent his wife to see the wife of Yu Hao with a > present of golden hair pins, and enquire about the cause of the motion. (Yu) > Hao laughed and said: 'That's easy, just fit in struts (pan) to settle the > work, fixed with (iron) nails, and it will not move any more.' The Master- > Builder followed his advice, and the tower stood quite firm. This is because > the nailed struts filled in and bound together (all the members) up and down > so that the six planes (above and below, front and back, left and right) > were mutually linked like the cage of the thorax. Although people might walk > on the struts, the six planes grasped and supported each other, so naturally > there could be no more motion. Everybody acknowledged the expertise thus > shown.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 141. In this next quote, Shen Kuo describes the dimensions and types of architecture outlined in Yu Hao's book: > Methods of building construction are described in the Timberwork Manual, > which, some say, was written by Yu Hao. (According to that book), buildings > have three basic units of proportion, what is above the cross-beams follows > the Upperwork Unit, what is above the ground floor follows the Middlework > Unit, and everything below that (platforms, foundations, paving, etc.) > follows the Lowerwork Unit. The length of the cross-beams will naturally > govern the lengths of the uppermost cross-beams as well as the rafters, etc. > Thus for a (main) cross-beam of (8 ft) length, an uppermost cross-beam of > (3.5 ft) length will be needed. (The proportions are maintained) in larger > and smaller halls. This (2/28) is the Upperwork Unit. Similarly, the > dimensions of the foundations must match the dimensions of the columns to be > used, as also those of the (side-) rafters, etc. For example, a column (11 > ft) high will need a platform (4.5 ft) high. So also for all the other > components, corbelled brackets, projecting rafters, other rafters, all have > their fixed proportions. All these follow the Middlework Unit (2/24). Now > below of ramps (and steps) there are three kinds, steep, easy-going, and > intermediate. In places these gradients are based upon a unit derived from > the imperial litters. Steep ramps are ramps for ascending which the leading > and trailing bearers have to extend their arms fully down and up > respectively (ratio 3/35). Easy-going ramps are those for which the leaders > use elbow length and the trailers shoulder height (ratio 1/38); intermediate > ones are negotiated by the leaders with downstretched arms and trailers at > shoulder height (ratio 2/18). These are the Lowerwork Units. The book (of Yu > Hao) had three chapters. But builders in recent years have become much more > precise and skillful (yen shan) than formerly. Thus for some time past the > old Timberwork Manual has fallen out of use. But (unfortunately) there is > hardly anybody capable of writing a new one. To do that would be a > masterpiece in itself!Needham, Volume 4, 82‚Äì84. Botany and zoology Shen Kuo described the natural predator insect similarly shaped to the gou-he (\\"dog-grubs\\") which preyed upon the agricultural pest infestation of zi-fang, the moth Leucania separata:Needham, Volume 6, Part 1, 545. > In the Yuan-Feng reign period (1078‚Äì1085), in the Qingzhou region, an > outbreak of zi-fang insects caused serious damage to the crops in the fields > in autumn. Suddenly another insect appeared in swarms of thousands and tens > of thousands, covering the entire ground area. It was shaped like earth- > burrowing gou-he (dog grubs), and its mouth was flanked by pincers. Whenever > it met a zi-fang, it would seize it with the pincers and break the poor > beast into two bits. Within ten days all the zi-fang had disappeared, so the > locality had an abundant harvest. Such kinds of insects have been known > since antiquity and the local people call them pang-bu-ken (\\"not allowing > other [insects] to be\\"). Natural phenomena Around 1078, Shen Kuo wrote an accurate description of the damaging effects of lightning to buildings and to the specific materials of objects within. Taking an objective and speculative viewpoint, he stated: > A house belonging to Li Shunju was struck by lightning. Brilliant sparkling > light was seen under the eaves. Everyone thought that the hall would be > burnt, and those who were inside rushed out. After the thunder had abated, > the house was found to be alright, though its walls and the paper on the > windows were blackened. On certain wooden shelves, certain lacquered vessels > with silver mouths had been struck by the lightning, so that the silver had > melted and dropped to the ground, but the lacquer was not even scorched. > Also, a valuable sword made of strong steel had been melted to liquid, > without the parts of the house nearby being affected. One would have thought > that the thatch and wood would have been burnt up first, yet here were > metals melted and no injury to thatch and wood. This is beyond the > understanding of ordinary people. There are Buddhist books which speak of > 'dragon fire' which burns more fiercely when it meets with water instead of > being extinguished by water like 'human' fire. Most people can only judge of > things by the experiences of ordinary life, but phenomena outside the scope > of this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural > principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective > ideas.Needham, Volume 3, 482.  \\"Strange Happenings\\"  A passage called \\"Strange Happenings\\" contains a peculiar account of an unidentified flying object. Shen wrote that, during the reign of Emperor Renzong (1022‚Äì1063), an object as bright as a pearl occasionally hovered over the city of Yangzhou at night, but described first by local inhabitants of eastern Anhui and then in Jiangsu.Dong (2000), 69. (Professor Zhang Longqiao of the Chinese Department of Peking Teachers' College, who popularized this account in Beijing's Guang Ming Daily on February 18, 1979, in an article called \\"Could It Be That A Visitor From Outer Space Visited China Long Ago?\\", states is \\"a clue that a flying craft from some other planet once landed somewhere near Yangzhou in China.\\") Shen wrote that a man near Xingkai Lake observed this curious object; allegedly it: > ...opened its door and a flood of intense light like sunbeams darted out of > it, then the outer shell opened up, appearing as large as a bed with a big > pearl the size of a fist illuminating the interior in silvery white. The > intense silver-white light, shot from the interior, was too strong for human > eyes to behold; it cast shadows of every tree within a radius of ten miles. > The spectacle was like the rising Sun, lighting up the distant sky and woods > in red. Then all of a sudden, the object took off at a tremendous speed and > descended upon the lake like the Sun setting.Dong (2000), 69‚Äì70. Shen went on to say that Yibo, a poet of Gaoyou, wrote a poem about this \\"pearl\\" after witnessing it. Shen wrote that since the \\"pearl\\" often made an appearance around Fanliang in Yangzhou, the people there erected a \\"Pearl Pavilion\\" on a wayside, where people came by boat in hopes to see the mysterious flying object.Dong (2000), 70‚Äì71. Swords Around 1065 Shen Kuo wrote about the assembly methods for swords, and the patterns produced in the steel:\\"A History of Metallography\\" by Cyril Smith (1960) > Ancient people use chi kang, (combined steel), for the edge, and jou thieh > (soft iron) for the back, otherwise it would often break. Too strong a > weapon will cut and destroy its own edge; that is why it is advisable to use > nothing but combined steel. As for the yu-chhang (fish intestines) effect, > it is what is now called the 'snake-coiling' steel sword, or alternatively, > the 'pine tree design'. If you cook a fish fully and remove its bones, the > shape of its guts will be seen to be like the lines on a 'snake-coiling > sword'.\\"A History of Metallography\\" by Cyril Smith (1960) Page 45 Chinese clothing Shen Kuo observed that the Chinese since some centuries prior had entirely adopted barbarian fashions. > > ‰∏≠ÂúãË°£ÂÜ†ÔºåËá™ÂåóÈΩä‰ª•‰æÜÔºå‰πÉÂÖ®Áî®ËÉ°Êúç„ÄÇÁ™ÑË¢ñ„ÄÅÁ∑ãÁ∂†Áü≠Ë°£„ÄÅÈï∑ÈùøÈù¥„ÄÅÊúâÈû¢Â∏∂ÔºåÁöÜËÉ°Êúç‰πü„ÄÇÁ™ÑË¢ñÂà©ÊñºÈ¶≥Â∞ÑÔºåÁü≠Ë°£„ÄÅÈï∑ÈùøÁöÜ‰æøÊñºÊ∂âËçâ„ÄÇËÉ°‰∫∫Ê®ÇËåÇËçâÔºåÂ∏∏ÂØ¢ËôïÂÖ∂ÈñìÔºå‰∫à‰ΩøÂåóÊôÇÁöÜË¶ã‰πã„ÄÇÈõñÁéãÂ∫≠‰∫¶Âú®Ê∑±Ëçê‰∏≠„ÄÇ‰∫àËá≥ËÉ°Â∫≠Êó•ÔºåÊñ∞Èõ®ÈÅéÔºåÊ∂âËçâÔºåË°£Ë§≤ÁöÜÊø°ÔºåÂîØËÉ°‰∫∫ÈÉΩÁÑ°ÊâÄÊ≤æ„ÄÇÂ∏∂Ë°£ÊâÄÂûÇËπÄË∫ûÔºåËìãÊ¨≤‰Ω©Â∏∂ÂºìÂäç„ÄÅÂ∏®„ÄÅÁÆóÂõä„ÄÅÂàÄÂãµ‰πãÈ°û„ÄÇ > The clothing of China since the Northern Qi [550‚Äì557] onward has been > entirely made barbarian.

The BC Express was built for the BC Express Company by Alexander Watson, Jr to work on the upper Fraser River between T√™te Jaune Cache and Fort George during the busy years of Grand Trunk Pacific Railway construction. The BC Express Company hired Captain Joseph Bucey, an experienced Skeena River pilot, to be her master. The route The upper Fraser River was navigable by sternwheeler between Soda Creek (start of navigation) and T√™te Jaune Cache (head of navigation). From Soda Creek to Fort George there were two formidable obstacles, the Cottonwood Canyon and the Fort George Canyon. Between Fort George and T√™te Jaune Cache, there were the Giscome Rapids, the Goat River Rapids and the fearsome Grand Canyon of the Fraser, which contained a powerful whirlpool. The Grand Trunk Pacific was being built from Winnipeg west and from Prince Rupert east. The two lines would meet on April 7, 1914 at Fort Fraser. Each end of construction was a portable town, which consisted of worker's accommodations, stores and even restaurants. These towns were referred to as the \\"end of steel\\". In 1912, the eastern end of construction would cross the Alberta BC border and by the spring of 1913 it would arrive at T√™te Jaune Cache. Construction The BC Express was the second sternwheeler built by the BC Express Company, the first one being the BX. Like the BX, the BC Express was also built at Soda Creek. And also like the BX, the BC Express's captain was involved in every stage of her planning and construction. Construction began on the BC Express in March 1912 at Soda Creek, on the very site where the BX had been built. Although the BC Express, when completed, would look much like her sister ship (lacking only the covered paddlewheel), in actuality the two sternwheelers were very different. They were designed for different purposes on different section of the upper Fraser. Whereas the BX was designed to carry loads upstream from Soda Creek, the BC Express was designed to carry loads downstream from T√™te Jaune Cache, which meant she would have to regularly navigate through the perilous Grand Canyon. With these facts in mind Alexander Watson and Joseph Bucey decided to build the BC Express six feet shorter and a foot narrower than the BX. Bucey also had Watson install a special \\"monkey rudder\\" on the BC Express's fantail, which would help him in maneuvering through the Grand Canyon. 1912 The BC Express was launched on the 24th of June and Captain Bucey took her up to Fort George on the 29th. He was so impressed by how well she handled in the Cottonwood and Fort George canyons that he took her up to the Grand Canyon the following week, where she had no trouble at all steaming over its infamous and deadly whirlpool. She continued to make trips between the Grand Canyon and Fort George until that September when the water levels dropped so low that Bucey decided that the Giscome Rapids were too unsafe to navigate. In October the water levels rose again and she made several trips between Fort George and Soda Creek before the season ended. 1913 1913 was the busiest year of navigation on the upper Fraser River because the end of steel for the eastern end of construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific had finally reached the head of navigation at T√™te Jaune Cache. It was estimated that 3,500 workers were working on the grade between T√™te Jaune Cache and Fort George and even more settlers and businessmen were moving into Fort George and the surrounding area. This had created a great surge of traffic over the Cariboo Road and the BC Express Company's stages and automobiles ran day and night to keep up with demand. Captain Bucey was not unaware of how busy and profitable the season would be. In anticipation of extending the BC Express's route all the way to T√™te Jaune Cache, he rode the CPR to Edmonton, Alberta and then took the GTP to T√™te Jaune Cache. From there he canoed downstream with a companion to Fort George, learning all he could about the upper reaches of the new route. Captain Bucey took the BC Express to T√™te Jaune Cache that May and returned with just twenty passengers and a small load of cargo. He wanted to see how the sternwheeler would run the Grand Canyon before he took her through with a capacity load. The trip was successful and the BC Express gained the title of the first loaded sternwheeler to ever run the Grand Canyon. Seeing this success, the railway's sternwheelers, the Operator and the Conveyor followed the very next day. Scow at Grand CanyonThe BC Express began a weekly round trip service from Fort Gorge to T√™te Jaune Cache, carrying capacity loads of freight and passengers. The passenger fare was $35, meals and berths extra, and the freight rate was $80 a ton. This latter seemed quite costly, until the shipper investigated the alternative shipping method, which was shipping his cargo by scow for $70 a ton, with no guarantee that the shipment would arrive intact, or at all. The risk to scows was mostly at the Grand Canyon, and the deadly whirlpool within it, which was responsible for the loss of at least eighty lives that summer alone, as well as the loss of approximately one in ten scows, and thousands of dollars of merchandise. Needless to say, the BC Express did a brisk business that season, often grossing $12,000 on a single trip. She was the only sternwheeler to offer freight and passenger service to the general public, as the Operator and Conveyor were strictly used for hauling their own workers and supplies needed for rail construction. The BC Express also had a very interesting season in 1913 and many stories of what occurred that summer were told and retold for years afterwards. The railworkers who wouldn't pay One afternoon in June, Bucey was returning from T√™te Jaune Cache and had just passed the Grand Canyon when he spotted a white flag on the river bank. This was a sign that someone needed the sternwheeler to stop, either to take on cargo or passengers. The passengers turned out to be twenty burly railworkers with their paychecks in their pockets, all of whom were on their way to Fort George. In particular, South Fort George, where there was a licensed hotel, and a variety of other entertainments, where one could celebrate the end of another work week. However, when the purser approached the first of these men for his fare, the man obstinately refused to pay, even after the purser offered to cash his company paycheck. Fearing that if he let one get away without paying that none would pay, the purser went up to the pilot house and spoke to Captain Bucey. Bucey landed the BC Express again and went down to speak to the man himself. When the man unwisely repeated that he wasn't paying, Bucey called over two deckhands who, without ceremony, threw the man overboard into the river. Bucey calmly returned to the pilot house and steamed the BC Express back into the center of the river again. The ousted passenger, luckily a strong swimmer, had made it to shore, but his companions must not have fancied the idea of following him into the frigid and swift water, as they all paid their fares immediately. The poker game Later that summer, a well known gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, and he spoke to Captain Bucey about the possibility of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present since the start of the game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for a moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship. The diamond salesman One afternoon in August 1913, Captain Bucey was attempting to run the BC Express through the Grand Canyon when he realized that the current was particularly strong in the whirlpool. Bucey decided that it would be necessary to line the sternwheeler through the canyon, and was pulling over to the side when a spruce tree, complete with root structure, appeared on the surface of the whirlpool and swept under the BC Express, jamming against her three main rudders. Though Bucey had lost his main method of steering, he was still able to use the steamer's paddlewheel to maneuver backwards through the canyon, where he would eventually come to a place along the shore where he could tie up and his crew could disembark and remove the tree and check for damages. Most of his passengers, knowing Bucey's skillful reputation, were untroubled by the BC Express's plight, but one man panicked and raced across the bow and leapt onto the canyon wall, where he was left clinging 6 feet above the whirlpool. Unable to do anything for the passenger, Bucey had to continue downstream, where half an hour later he was able to tie up. After landing, Bucey's first thought was for his stranded passenger, and he sent out a rescue party of three men, led by AK Bouchier, the BC Express Company's agent at T√™te Jaune Cache. The men walked back up the canyon and were relieved and astonished to find the man still clinging to the canyon wall, 70 feet below them. One of the rescuers was lowered down with a rope, and the passenger was hauled up to safety. The first thing the rescued man did was check his pockets for two small leather bags he was carrying, both full of diamond rings that he peddled along the new rail towns to brothels and private buyers. Once assured that his precious diamonds were safe, he was taken back to his berth on the BC Express and given a stiff scotch. The low level bridge at Mile 141 Low level bridge construction at Mile 141 (1913) At the end of August 1913, Captain Bucey was taking the BC Express up from Fort George to T√™te Jaune Cache when he encountered a cable strung across the river at Mile 141 where the railway would be building a bridge. Knowing that the railway had promised that they would not impede navigation on the upper Fraser River and that the bridge, once built, was going to be built with a lift span, Bucey stopped and asked that the cable be removed so he could pass. The bridge workers refused, and when Bucey reminded them of the railway's promise not to impede navigation, the workers informed Captain Bucey that they knew of no plans to build the bridge with a lift span and had been told that they were to protect the cable, \\"using force if necessary.\\" Bucey was furious and threatened to use a shotgun on the workers, thus blasting his way through to T√™te Jaune Cache. Cooler heads eventually prevailed, and Bucey turned the BC Express back towards Fort George. Once back in town, Bucey immediately wired the company's head office at Ashcroft and informed them of the obstruction. The BC Express Company had the Board of Railway Commissioners investigate the situation, and the Board came back in the company's favor and told the railway they must build the bridge at Mile 141 and the other at Bear River with lift spans as promised. The GTP refused the order, stating that if they changed the level of the bridges they'd have to change the level of the grade. The company took the railway to court for damages and loss of revenue, as they had been earning in excess of $5,000 a week on that route, but by the time the case was heard, World War I had begun, and the company's attorney was engaged in war work and was unable to appear. His replacement, a junior partner with little experience, was unable to prepare and present the evidence properly, and the company lost the case. Some historians have opined that the railway built these bridges to impede navigation out of spite and dislike for the BC Express Company because its owner at that time, Charles Vance Millar, had negotiated with the First Nation's people at Fort George to buy the land that the GTP wanted for their town-site. The GTP got the land, but were forced to settle with Millar and sell him a section of the new town-site, which would later be called the Millar Addition. The end of an era In 1915, only the BX was used on the upper Fraser River, with the BC Express reserved for special trips. In 1916 and 1917, sternwheelers were not used at all. In 1918, after an appeal from the Quesnel Board of Trade, the provincial government granted the BC Express Company a $10,000 per year subsidy to continue river navigation from Soda Creek to Fort George. The BX ran until August 30, 1919, when she was punctured by an infamous rock called the \\"Woodpecker\\" and sank with a 100 tons of bagged cement intended for construction of the Deep Creek Bridge. BX sunk at Woodpecker (1919) The BC Express Company, fully intending to salvage their prized craft, hired Alexander Watson Jr to rush up from Victoria to overhaul the BC Express, which had been out of service since 1915, so she could go rescue the BX. However, out at the site of the accident, it was discovered that the bags of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey. The BC Express ran until November 1920 and then it joined the BX on the riverbank at Fort George, where their hulls were abandoned. In a sense, they lived on, as their engines and equipment were shipped to Northern Alberta to work on the Mackenzie River for the Alberta and Arctic Transportation Company.

One day, while hunting, the king captured a wild man. Imprisoning him, he gave the keys to the queen. He set out hunting again, and Guerrino wanted to see the wild man. The wild man stole an arrow he carried and promised to give it back if Guerrino freed him. Guerrino did so and warned him to flee; the wild man told him that he would and left. (The wild man in fact had been a handsome youth who had despaired of the love of a lady and so took to the wild.) The queen woke and questioned everyone. Guerrino told her that no one would be punished but him, because he did it. The queen took two faithful servants, gave them money, and sent Guerrino away. The king returned and found the wild man gone. The queen told that Guerrino had done it, and then that she had sent Guerrino away, which enraged him even more, that she should think he would hold his son in less regard than the wild man. He searched for him but did not find him. The servants agreed to kill Guerrino, but they could not agree on how to divide the loot; while they still had not settled, a fine young man greeted them and asked to come with him, and Guerrino agreed. This was the same wild man; he had met a fairy suffering from a distemper, who had burst out laughing at the sight of him and so been cured. She transformed him, endowed him magic powers, and gave him a magic horse. They came to a town, Irlanda, ruled by King Zifroi with two beautiful daughters, Potentiana and Eleuteria. Guerrino took lodgings. The young man made to go on, but Guerrino persuaded him to stay. At the time, the lands were attacked by a wild horse and a wild mare that ruined crops and killed beasts, men, and women. The two servants told the king that Guerrino had boasted that he could kill these horses. The king summoned him and promised to reward him if he did it; when Guerrino hesitated, he threatened to execute him if he did not. The young man told him to get a blacksmith's services from the king, and then have the blacksmith make enormous horseshoes for the young man's horse. Then he had Guerrino ride the horse until he met the horse, at which point he should dismount, free the horse, and climb a tree. Guerrino did this, the horses fought, and the wild one was defeated. The king was pleased, but the servants furious because of their failure. They said that Guerrino had boasted likewise of the wild mare, and the king set him to defeat it as well; he did, as he had the horse. The night after, he was woken by a noise and found a wasp in a honey pot, which he freed. The king summoned him, said he had to reward him, and offered him one of his daughters, if Guerrino could tell beneath their veils which was Potentiana, who had golden hair, and which Eleuteria, who had silver hair. If he guessed wrong, he would be executed. Guerrino went back to his lodgings, where the young man told him that the wasp would fly three times around Potentiana, and she would drive it off three times, that night. Then he should identify her. Guerrino said he did not know how he could reward him for his favors. The young man told him that he was the wild man, and so he was but returning what Guerrino had done for him, and his name was Rubinetto. Guerrino went to the palace, where the princesses were entirely covered with white veils. The king told him to make his choice, time was passing, but Guerrino insisted on the full-time. The wasp buzzed about Potentiana, and she drove it off. Guerrino said she was Potentiana, and they married. Rubinetto married Eleuteria. Guerrino's parents heard of him, and he returned to them with his wife and Rubinetto and his wife, where they lived in happiness.

These sensors are able to detect electromagnetic radiation from the infrared up to the ultraviolet wavelengths. They are used in many industrial and consumer applications, for example: * Lamps that turn on automatically in response to darkness * Position sensors that activate when an object interrupts a light beam * Flash detection, to synchronize one photographic flash to another * Photoelectric sensors that detect the distance, absence, or presence of an object  Function  An optical sensor converts light rays into electronic signals. It measures the physical quantity of light and then translates it into a form that is readable by an instrument. An optical sensor is generally part of a larger system that integrates a source of light, a measuring device and the optical sensor. This is often connected to an electrical trigger. The trigger reacts to a change in the signal within the light sensor. An optical sensor can measure the changes from one or several light beams. When a change occurs, the light sensor operates as a photoelectric trigger and therefore either increases or decreases the electrical output. An optical switch enables signals in optical fibres or integrated optical circuits to be switched selectively from one circuit to another. An optical switch can operate by mechanical means or by electro-optic effects, magneto-optic effects as well as by other methods. Optical switches are optoelectronic devices which can be integrated with integrated or discrete microelectronic circuits.  Types of optical sensors and switches  There are many different kinds of optical sensors, the most common types are: * Photoconductive devices convert a change of incident light into a change of resistance. * Photovoltaics, commonly known as solar cells, convert an amount of incident light into an output voltage. * Photodiodes convert an amount of incident light into an output current. * Phototransistors are a type of bipolar transistor where the base-collector junction is exposed to light. This results in the same behaviour of a photodiode, but with an internal gain. Optical Switches are usually used in optical fibers, where the electro-optic effect is used to switch one circuit to another. These switches can be implemented with, for example, microelectromechanical systems or piezoelectric systems.  Applications  Optical heart-rate sensor Electro- optical sensors are used whenever light needs to be converted to energy. Because of this, electro-optical sensors can be seen almost anywhere. Common applications are smartphones where sensors are used to adjust screen brightness, and smartwatches in which sensors are used to measure the wearer's heartbeat. Optical sensors can be found in the energy field to monitor structures that generate, produce, distribute, and convert electrical power. The distributed and nonconductive nature of optical fibres makes optical sensors perfect for oil and gas applications, including pipeline monitoring. They can also be found in wind turbine blade monitoring, offshore platform monitoring, power line monitoring and downhole monitoring. Other applications include the civil and transportation fields such as bridge, airport landing strip, dam, railway, airplane, wing, fuel tank and ship hull monitoring. Among other applications, optical switches can be found in thermal methods which vary the refraction index in one leg of an interferometer in order to switch the signal, MEMS approaches involving arrays of micromirrors that can deflect an optical signal to the appropriate receiver, piezoelectric beam steering liquid crystals which rotate polarized light depending on the applied electric field and acousto-optic methods which change the refraction index as a result of strain induced by an acoustic field to deflect light. Another important application of optical sensor is to measure the concentration of different compounds by both visible and infrared spectroscopy.

The Council was established at an implementation conference held in London, United Kingdom on December 8 and 9, 1995,London Conference conclusions subsequent to the completion of the negotiations of the accord the preceding month.For details see United Security Council, document symbol: S/1995/1029 The Council is, in effect, the realization, through the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the international community's governance of Bosnia and Herzegovina after signature of the Dayton Agreement. This international control over Bosnia and Herzegovina is to last until the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustainable. The PIC comprises 55 countries and agencies that support the peace process in many different ways - by assisting it financially, providing troops for SFOR, or directly running operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is also a fluctuating number of observers. Since the London conference, the PIC has come together at the ministerial level another six times to review progress and define the goals of peace implementation for the coming period: in June 1996 in Florence, Italy; in December 1996 for a second time in London; in December 1997 in Bonn, Germany; in December 1998 in Madrid, Spain, in May 2000 and February 2007 in Brussels, Belgium. The PIC clarifies the responsibilities of the High Representative as the main implementing body of the civilian part of the Dayton Agreement, as set out in Annex 10 the Dayton Agreement. For example, the 1997 Bonn session provided the Office of the High Representative with the so-called \\"Bonn authority\\" to dismiss elected and non-elected officials who obstruct the implementation of the Dayton Agreement. The High Representative from 2006-2007, Christian Schwarz-Schilling, used this power sparingly, to promote confidence in elected domestic government. This strategy was reversed by the new appointee to that post, Miroslav Lajƒç√°k, who imposed several decisions on his first day at work. Steering Board The London peace implementation conference established the Steering Board of the PIC to work under the chairmanship of the High Representative as the executive arm of the PIC. The Steering Board members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, United States, Presidency of the European Union, European Commission, and Organisation of the Islamic Conference, represented by Turkey. The Steering Board provides the High Representative with political guidance. In Sarajevo, the High Representative chairs bi-weekly meetings of the Ambassadors to BiH of the Steering Board members. In addition, the Steering Board meets at the level of political directors every six months.

Named for the Minotaur (the mythological monster of Crete, half man half bull, who was confined in the Labyrinth), she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Originally laid down as LST-645 by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company of Seneca, Illinois 20 June 1944; redesignated ARL-15 on 14 August 1944; launched 20 September 1944; placed in ferry commission 30 September for conversion at Mobile, Alabama; and commissioned as USS Minotaur (ARL 15) 26 February 1945 with Lieutenant Joseph H. Church in command. Service history=1st commission Completing shakedown in March 1945 at the Amphibious Training Base, Panama City, Florida, Minotaur returned to Mobile to load steelplate and marine engines before departing for the Pacific. Steaming via the Marshall and Caroline Island groups, she anchored Buckner Bay, Okinawa on 4 June 1945. Having arrived during the final stage in the capture of this Japanese bastion, she remained at Okinawa through the end of the War and until 12 December 1945, when she sailed her landing craft repair facilities to Iwo Jima. Making two voyages to Chichi Jima, Bonin Islands, she served in the area a month and a half before heading home. Transiting the Panama Canal 10 April 1946, Minotaur entered the Mississippi River eight days later and moored in New Orleans. In June 1946, Minotaur arrived at Orange, Texas and joined the 16th Fleet. She decommissioned 26 February 1947. 2nd commission During the Korean War, Minotaur recommissioned 14 June 1951 with Lieutenant Commander D. Garrett in command. Assigned to Mine Squadron 8 and home ported at Charleston, South Carolina, for the next four years she repaired minesweepers and net layers. She made working visits to Panama City and Yorktown, Virginia and maintained sea readiness during training periods in the Chesapeake Bay operating area. Minotaur departed coastal waters only once for a short Caribbean tour early in 1953 before being made available for foreign duty under the Military Assistance Program two years later. At New York 3 October 1955 Minotaur decommissioned and was loaned to the Republic of Korea, where she served the Republic of Korea Navy as ROKS Duk Soo (ARL 1). When she was decommissioned he last Captain was Lieutenant Commander E. A. McCammond. She is still in service with the ROK Navy. Minotaur received one battle star for World War II service.

Pro boxing career Nicknamed \\"Mighty Quinn\\", Page turned pro in 1990 and beat Andrei Pestriaev in 1998 to capture the Vacant WBA Welterweight Title. He defended the title three times until he was stripped, in 2000, for failing to turn up for a mandatory title defense in Las Vegas.Tribune News Service Retrieved 20 July 2007 Page fought for the Vacant WBA Welterweight Title yet again, against Andrew Lewis in 2001. Page lost via TKO in the 7th round. He retired after the bout. Troubles outside the ring=2001 arrest Page was arrested in December 2001, 45 minutes after he robbed a Bank of America Branch in Atlanta. Police said they saw his 1999 Cadillac, which he bought with his championship earnings, parked outside a bar four miles from the bank. They found almost $6,000 in his pocket. Earlier that day, Page had attempted to rob another bank, according to court records, which said he also robbed an Alpharetta bank a week earlier. Page had previous convictions for robbery and drug offenses. He was sentenced to 11 years in Federal prison. Failed boxing comeback attempt in 2012 after release Throughout his incarceration, Page claimed he maintained a daily boxing workout regimen, including daily exercising and a five-mile running program in preparation for his release date. After being released from Federal prison in 2012, Page's return to society-and the professional ring after an 11-year hiatus-were both failures. After getting relicensed by the California State Boxing Commission, Page was knocked out in the second round of a failed comeback attempt in November 2012 by journeyman Rahman Mustafa Yusubov. Not only did Yusubov have a losing record, his victory over Page was his only win in his last 11 pro bouts, and Yusubov's only win over a fighter with a winning record in seven years. Clearly, Page, at age 42, was not as prepared to return to the ring as he led others to believe, and had nothing left. 2013 arrest On June 10, 2013, Page, whose stint in prison had not reformed him, was arrested in West Oakland, California, as a result of the ‚Äúbutton-down bandit‚Äù serial bank robber investigation. The \\"button-down bandit\\" was charged in connection with six bank robberies in the East San Francisco Bay Area between March and June 2013. In each robbery, the robber wore various button-down, collared, long-sleeved shirts, leading investigators to dub the suspect the ‚Äúbutton-down bandit.‚Äù Surveillance photographs were disseminated to law enforcement agencies and the public during the investigation and led a police officer in Oakley to identify Page. The officer had previous law enforcement contact with Page during his patrols, according to the FBI. Page was arrested in connection with the robbing of two Chase Banks, three Wells Fargo Banks, two U.S. banks, and a Bank of America across the East Bay. According to Claycord.com, Page was booked into the Martinez Detention Facility (MDF). With his new arrest, and the overwhelming evidence against him which will lead to another lengthy prison term, Page's boxing career is likely over. 2014 On August 19,Page pleaded guilty to the San Francisco Bay Area bank robberies in February.A judge sentenced him to 7 years in prisonhttp://www.foxsports.com/boxing/story/boxer-turned-bank-robber-gets- seven-year-sentence-082014  See also  * List of WBA world champions References External links  * Category:1971 births Category:Boxers from California Category:Living people Category:Welterweight boxers Category:World boxing champions Category:American male boxers ","title":"James Page (boxer)"},{"id":"10924311","text":"The Douglas O-2 was a 1920s American observation aircraft built by the Douglas Aircraft Company. Development The important family of Douglas observation aircraft sprang from two XO-2 prototypes, the first of which was powered by the 420 hp (313 kW) Liberty V-1650-1 V-engine and test-flown in the autumn of 1924. The second XO-2 was powered by the 510 hp (380 kW) Packard 1A-1500 Vee engine, which proved unreliable. The US Army ordered 45 O-2 production aircraft in 1925, these retaining the XO-2's welded steel tube fuselage, wooden wings and overall fabric covering but at the same time introducing aluminum panels on the forward fuselage. The XO-2 had been flown with short and long-span wings, the latter giving improved handling and therefore being specified for the production aircraft. The fixed tailskid landing gear included a main unit of the divided type, the horizontal tail surface was strut braced, and the engine was cooled by a tunnel radiator. The O-2 proved to be a conventional but very reliable biplane which soon attracted orders for 25 more aircraft: 18 O-2A machines equipped for night flying and six O-2B dual-control command aircraft for the US Army, plus one civil O-2BS modified specially for James McKee, who made a remarkable trans-Canada flight in September 1926. In 1927 the O-2BS was adapted as a three-seater with a radial engine. The O-2Hs were an entirely new design but continued the same basic model number. Major differences were heavily staggered wings, a more compact engine installation, and clean landing gear secured to the fuselage. Up to 2011 there were no O-2's known to exist. However, in 2011 the wreckage of O-2H 29-163 that crashed out of Kelly Field Texas on March 16, 1933 has been positively identified. The rear and central/forward portion of the fuselage behind the firewall, wing attachments and landing gear parts, tailplane and many engine parts and eight of the twelve pistons are now recovered. Research is continuing on this aircraft. It is known it was flown by Aviation Cadet Charles D. Rogers on a night recon advanced training mission. Apparently flying low, the aircraft hit a hill and burned after the crash leaving only the found wreckage today. Weather was not considered a contributing factor. Cadet Rogers was instantly killed in the crash by the impact. His body was recovered but the wreckage was abandoned due to the airframe and engine both being a writeoff. The only similar aircraft known to exist are a restored Douglas M-2 mailplane and a follow-on derivative of the O-25 variant, an O-38. Operational history Douglas O-2M variants were deployed in combat against the Imperial Japanese forces early on in the Second Sino-Japanese War; equipping the Chinese Air Force 6th and 8th Bomber/Scouting Groups.https://air.mnd.gov.tw/EN/PastCurrent/PastCurrent_Detail.aspx?FID=28&CID;=176&ID;=1333 Variants ;XO-2 : Two pre-production prototypes. ;O-2 : Initial production model - 45 built. ;O-2A : O-2 with night flying equipment - 18 built. ;O-2B : Dual control version of O-2 - six built. ;O-2C : These differed from the O-2 in having frontal radiators for their Liberty L-12 engines and modified oleo- strut landing gear.

NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. The album was originally conceived as a double album. In the recording sessions the Triffids were joined by producer Stephen Street (the Smiths' - Strangeways, Here We Come and Morrissey's Viva Hate). The Black Swan used a greater variety of musical instruments than their previous albums with bouzouki, g√ºiro and accordion and a more obvious use of synths and programming. The title of the album was originally going to be Disappointment Resort ComplexRock Australia Magazine - Jon Casimir (17 May 1989) but was renamed to The Black Swan, which according to a 1989 interview by Stephen Phillips (NME) with David McComb is based on the 1954 novel of the same name by Thomas Mann.New Musical Express (22 April 1989) Background The chosen single from the album, \\"Goodbye Little Boy\\", featured Jill Birt on vocals and 'glammed up' for the record sleeve. \\"Too Hot To Move\\" was one of three songs written by David McComb which were used in the ABC TV series Sweet and Sour (1984) it had lead vocals by Deborah Conway (of Do-R√©-Mi).

What's the matter with mess anyway? I've gone out on a limb with this one, at Dave's request. He had hoped this record could be a double album when it was recorded - he knew it was so varied that it sounded like nothing else anyone was doing at the time and he thought you shouldn't do things by halves.  Reception  Q said, \\"All 13 songs develop like variations on a theme. McComb usually portrays one half of a broken relationship contemplating sober or unsober home truths about life's fallibilities from uncomfortable isolation. The musical settings are constantly stunning.\\" AllMusic noted, \\"while previous Triffids albums were never homogeneous, on The Black Swan strikingly disparate stylistic elements rub shoulders, sometimes during the same song, from opera to funk to jazz to rap and hip-hop. Frontman David McComb saw the potential of rap and hip-hop to reenergize rock's increasingly dull, uniform idiom and several numbers blend genres in modest but prescient ways.\\" The Guardian said, \\"Black Swan was intended to be the Triffids' White Album.

Girart de Roussillon ruled Provence from Vienne in the mid-ninth century. His successor in Vienne was Boso I of Arles, who tried to carve out a kingdom of his own in Provence from Vienne in 878-879\\\\. Hugh of Arles was the first known Count of Vienne from sometime before 905 until 926, when he was in Italy claiming the Iron Crown of Lombardy. In his absence, Louis the Blind, King of Provence, transferred Vienne to his own son, Charles-Constantine. In September 928, Hugh met with Herbert II of Vermandois and invested Herbert's son Odo with Vienne in opposition to Charles-Constantine. Charles, however, succeeded in reoccupying Vienne by 931 with the aid of Rudolph of France, to whom he gave his fealty. Briefly dispossessed by Hugh Taillefer, an ally of King Hugh, Charles succeeded retaking Vienne in 931 with the aid of Rudolph and his men. Until 23 June 962, Charles-Constantine ruled Vienne, the former capital of the extinct kingdom of his father. After his death on that date, Vienne was inherited by his daughter Constance and passed to her husband, Boso II of Arles. Boso's descendants accumulated many counties in Provence and succeeded eventually in making themselves margraves of Provence. In 1030, Vienne was ceded to Archbishop Burchard, however, and he immediately divided the lordship into two counties. He elevated Guigues III of Albon, one of his powerful vassals, to the status of count and he granted Maurienne as a county to Humbert of the White Hands. Nevertheless, a county of Vienne continued to exist in a much diminished form. From 1085 to 1261, it was held by the Counts of M√¢con. In the latter year, the last countess, Alice, sold it, along with M√¢con, to King Louis IX of France after the death of her husband, Jehan de Braine, in 1240. Sources *Previt√©-Orton, C.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Structure Sonnet 123 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 3rd line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / To me are nothing novel, nothing strange; (123.3) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Although every line may be scanned regularly, some lines may be otherwise construed, such as line 13 which can be read with an initial reversal: / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / This I do vow, and this shall ever be, (123.13) The meter demands a few variant pronunciations: line 10's \\"wondering\\" functions as two syllables, and line 12's \\"continual\\" as three; line 11's \\"records\\" (although it is a noun, not a verb) is to be stressed on the second syllable. Analysis Shakespeare addresses the ideas of change and growth in one's lifetime by metaphorically standing up against time Father Time. The major theme is that years continue to pass and the narrator is naturally getting older with each passing year, but he does not feel that it is necessary for his character to change accordingly. There are changes in the physical world that may happen within one's lifetime (pyramids), but that is not substantial on a personal level. Even so, we ought to respect what was done before us; however, that does not mean we have to revere it and at the same time an individual's pride would persuade one to think of these ideas as one's own, rather than something merely copied from the past (lines 5-8). There is little point in worrying about what has already happened, or for that matter worrying about what is happening now, but one should just live one's life for what it is. Copying down events and comparing written records with mental recollection is pointless because it wastes time in the present to do so, and time is continually moving (lines 9-12). Finally, the narrator resolves that no matter what happens in life (as new events to come are \\"done\\" by Time) he will stick to his own constitution and be true to himself regardless of what any consequences may be. There are numerous other takes on the sonnet ranging from the poem's use of time (or lack thereof) as a metaphor for the tyranny of post-modernist working life as well as the potential sociopolitical themes apparent in the poem's thematic fear of change (conservatism). This sonnet is one of the few pieces in Shakespeare that references ideas such as time, change, and death without the use of direct biblical or literary allusion.

The novel was first serialized in three parts and published in Astounding Science Fiction magazine in 1958. Its first hardcover book publication was in July 1964. Setting Revolving on an orbit about the star Altair, Tenebra is an example of one of Hal Clement's \\"hellworlds\\". 27 times the mass of Earth, Tenebra is three times Earth's diameter (38,226 kilometers; 23,746 miles) and has three times Earth's gravity at its surface (29.43 meters per second per second; 96.6 feet per second per second), which gives Tenebra an escape velocity of 33.558 kilometers per second (nearly 21 miles per second). Clement also describes the planet as rotating on its axis in a little less than four Earth days. Tenebra has an atmosphere \\"consisting of water heavily laced with oxygen and oxides of sulphur\\". At the surface the temperature comes close enough to the critical point of water (temperature = 374 Celsius; 705 Fahrenheit : pressure = 22.1 megaPascals; 217.755 atmospheres) that during the night the atmosphere begins to condense into the liquid state and falls as raindrops 9 to 15 meters (30 to 50 feet) wide. The naively expected density of the surface atmosphere stands at about 322 kilograms per cubic meter (compared to 1.2 kilograms per cubic meter at sea level on Earth). But the raindrops descend slowly, even in Tenebra's stiff gravity. That latter statement necessitates, as Clement states in the story, that the surface pressure on Tenebra be 800 atmospheres, not 218. At 800 atmospheres of pressure the surface atmosphere, with its load of dissolved oxygen and sulphur oxides, is compressed to a density a little less than the density of liquid water (1182 kilograms per cubic meter). Only when the density of the planet's air is a little less than the density of liquid water will the raindrops descend slowly; otherwise, they would come down like meteors and make life on Tenebra impossible. But life is possible on Tenebra. Although Clement doesn't say so explicitly, Tenebra's plants do not use photosynthesis. The optical depth of the atmosphere is too great for enough of Altair's light to reach the ground. Instead, Tenebra's plants use chemosynthesis based on the transformation of sulphur oxides. The process is much like that used by plants growing around the hydrothermal vents known as black smokers on the bottom of Earth's oceans. Altair's abundant ultraviolet radiation, striking the top of Tenebra's atmosphere, restores the balance among the various sulphur oxides. Because Tenebra's atmosphere contains large quantities of sulphur, the planet's lakes and small oceans are filled with sulphuric acid. Throughout the day-night cycle the lakes and oceans rise and fall like tides in the Bay of Fundy, due to the heavy nightly rainfall and the easy evaporation of the liquid water (its heat of vaporization stands close to zero under Tenebran conditions). The constant ebb and flow of hot, pressurized sulphuric acid weakens the planet's crust, resulting in frequent earthquakes and minor rearrangements of the landscape. For two decades humans have been observing this world from the space station Vindemiatrix, which revolves about Tenebra on a synchronous orbit, one with a period just under 96 hours. Plot summary It began with human researchers sending a semi-autonomous robot to the surface of Tenebra. The robot descended on rocket boosters until atmospheric pressure exceeded the pressure in the rockets' combustion chambers. Instead of generating thrust, the rockets began to overheat and melt themselves, so the controllers jettisoned the engines and the robot completed its descent under a parachute. After acclimatizing itself to the dark world under Tenebra's thick clouds, the robot set out to explore. After months of mapping the territory and observing the plants and animals, the robot encountered a sentient native. The creature resembled a very large, scale-armored fir cone with four pairs of limbs; the lowest pair used for walking, the next pair apparently not used at all, and the upper two pairs used for prehension (used as arms and hands). A set of spines jutting from the top of the creature served as lensless eyes, making maximum use of the thin flow of photons seeping from the sky. Unseen by the native, the robot followed it, stole ten of its eggs and good selection of stone knives that the creature had set out in booby traps, and then took its loot far from the caves in which the creature and its clan lived. Sixteen years later Nick Chopper is on the run. Trying to elude the people he is certain are tracking him, he returns to the little hilltop village of huts that he shares with his nine siblings and the robot, now called Fagin (a reference to the character in Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist). He reports that while he was mapping some new territory he had encountered, for the first time, creatures just like himself. He had stayed with them long enough to learn a little of their language. Through a diplomatic error Nick gains the enmity of the chief of the people, a nine-foot brute whose name translates into English as Swift. Fearing that Swift intends to bring his warriors to their village to murder him and his siblings, Nick dares, for the first time, to travel at night, using burning sticks (fire on Tenebra does not produce flames, but merely glows the bright yellow-orange of fresh embers) both to light his way and to fend off the raindrops that would knock him out if one enveloped him. Before Nick, on Fagin's instructions, can go back down the trail to intercept Swift and make peace, Swift and his warriors arrive and attack the village. Using fire as a weapon, Nick and his siblings manage to fight Swift and his warriors to a stalemate. To avoid further violence, Fagin goes with Swift back to his cave village and Nick and his siblings prepare to abandon their village to find a safer place to stay. Meanwhile, aboard the space station Vindemiatrix, Dr Helven Raeder, the current voice of Fagin, is interrupted by Amindebarlee, the ambassador from Dromm, a planet of Eta Cassiopeiae (19.42 lightyears from Sol, 21.92 lightyears from Altair), and his son Aminadorneldo. The presence of the Drommians, who resemble hairless ten- foot otters with five pairs of limbs and who have voices pitched much higher than human voices, reminds Raeder of something he can use to solve his problem with Fagin. The humans have built a space-going bathyscaphe that they intend to use to descend to Tenebra's surface and then return to Vindemiatrix. Raeder conceives the idea of using the craft to rescue Fagin by using the bathyscaphe's grapplers to pick up the robot and then fly it away so that Swift and his people cannot track it. Then he will move Nick and his siblings far away to avoid the inevitable retaliation. Unfortunately for Raeder's plan Aminadorneldo and Easy Rich, the twelve-year-old daughter of Councilor Rich, have gone to tour the bathyscaphe. While the two are alone aboard the craft, the bathyscaphe suffers an accident that sends it onto a trajectory that will compel it to land on Tenebra. Worse, although Aminadorneldo looks like an adult Drommian, he is actually four years old, with the development level of a seven-year-old Terran boy. The bathyscaphe lands safely on Tenebra, but the rescue team discovers that the electrolyzers do not work. Meant to use Tenebra's atmosphere as feedstock, they were intended to fill the bathyscaphe's flotation cells with hydrogen so that the craft would rise high enough into the atmosphere for its rocket engines to work and, in this case, to be intercepted by a shuttle that would stand on the thrust of its engines while an engineer finished connecting the circuits that would fire the bathyscaphe's rockets. In some desperation Raeder decides to ask Nick and his siblings to find the bathyscaphe and then, following his instructions, repair the electrolyzers. Having piled as many of their belongings as they can on the little cart that they have used in gathering firewood, Nick and the others round up their livestock (which they call by the English word cattle), and set out on Tenebra's first ever cattle drive, heading for the coast. Once they have found a relatively safe place and set up camp, Nick goes back to the cave village to rescue Fagin while the others set out to map the area around their camp. Using fire to distract Swift's people, Nick takes off with Fagin and rejoins his siblings. Swift and his people are not far behind, but before a battle can erupt Fagin convinces the two groups to work together in finding the bathyscaphe. Once the Tenebrites have found the bathyscaphe they must somehow send it high into the atmosphere. Rather than attempt to repair the electrolyzers, they use an alternative plan devised by Easy. They capture floaters, jellyfish-like creatures with stinging tentacles and hydrogen-filled flotation sacs. After hacking off the creatures' tentacles, they bring them to the bathyscaphe and squeeze their hydrogen directly into the bathyscaphe's buoyancy tanks. There's no shortage of floaters: a strange wind that has been blowing for many days keeps bringing more to the area. When the Tenebrites have put just enough hydrogen into the bathyscaphe's tanks the craft lifts off the ground and, in the other part of Easy's plan, the wind carries the craft to its source, the caldera of a wide and active volcano, whose hot updraft carries the bathyscaphe to its rendezvous with the shuttle. Reception SF Impulse reviewer Tom Boardman Jr. commended the novel for its \\"impressive plotting and sustained suspense,\\" noting that Clement's \\"consummate craftsmanship\\" turned a simple story into an intense one.\\"Book Fare,\\" SF Impulse, November 1966, p.63-64. James Nicoll, writing in 2017, noted that \\"(m)odern readers may be appalled by the casual way that Fagin steals eggs and raises a clutch of helpless infants to serve as his spies\\", and lauded Clement's choice to show that raising Tenebrans as humans, in total isolation from Tenebran culture, would have long-term negative repercussions; he also praised the egalitarian and nonsexualized portrayal of Easy Rich.Though The Truth May Vary , by James Nicoll, published December 10, 2017; retrieved December 10, 2017 ReferencesExternal links * Category:1958 American novels Category:1958 science fiction novels Category:Altair in fiction Category:American science fiction novels Category:Space exploration novels Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Ballantine Books books ","title":"Close to Critical"},{"id":"10924536","text":"Cyril Chapuis (born 21 March 1979) is a French former professional footballer who played as a striker.

It ceased to sing, but he threatened to kill anyone who freed it. One day, it pleaded with the lord's son Georgic, who freed it; it told him to call on it, Merlin, if in need and then flew off. Georgic's mother feared that her husband would kill Georgic. A salt-vendor offered to take him away, and his mother gave him money to do it. He took the money and at the next castle, offered the boy as a shepherd, despite the warnings of wolves that threatened. When the salt-vendor went to leave him, Georgic demanded the money and when it was refused, he called on the bird; it appeared, and a club wielded by an invisible hand struck the man until he gave the money. Then he called on the bird to give him a whistle to summon the wolves and muzzles to keep them from biting, and so he kept the sheep safe. In the same region, there was a dragon with seven heads that had to receive a maiden every year. That year, the lot fell to Georgic's master's daughter, who wept for fear. When she was sent, Georgic asked the bird for a horse, a sword, and a black cloak; he took her on his horse and carried her to the place, where he called for the dragon. It declared it was not hungry that day, she was to come back the next, and left. Georgic carried her back; she had been too upset to recognize him, but she had cut a piece from his cloak. She went back the next day, and this time Georgic wore a gray cloak, but the events went as before. The third day, Georgic wore a purple cloak, and he stopped and borrowed a long iron fork that a man was using on the stove. He used it to drag the dragon from its lair and cut off its heads with his sword. He cut out the tongues, and the daughter cut off a piece of this cloak as well. A coal miner claimed to have done killed the dragon. The daughter said the dragon slayer had cut out the tongues, and the coal miner claimed to have eaten them. The lord held a great feast, and the daughter saw Georgic in his black cloak, which had exactly the hole in it that she had cut. Georgic vanished. The lord had a second banquet, at which Georgic wore the gray cloak, with the hole just as she had cut it; the lord asked him whether he was the one who had rescued his daughter, and he said he might be. At the third banquet, Georgic arrived in a grand manner. The daughter recognized him by the hole, and they married. Soon after, her father fell ill. A wizard said that he could be cured with a piece of orange from the orange tree of the Armenian Sea, water from the Fountain of Life, and some bread and wine from the Yellow Queen. Georgic had two brothers-in-law who were jealous of him; they set out and became lost. Georgic also set out. In the woods, he met a hermit, who gave him a magic wand to lead him. It would take him to the orange tree, where he should cut the orange into four parts, one of which he should take away. Then he would reach the Fountain of Life, but he should go to the Yellow Queen's castle first, taking some wine and bread, and a lance, calling out it was for his father-in-law's health. He would then find a stag which he should ride to the Fountain; if the lion that guarded it woke, he should use the lance to kill it. He retrieved the things in this way. He met his brothers-in-law along the way, and traded some of what he had won for the ear and wedding ring of one, and the toe of the other. The hermit had warned him that he would have to give what he had taken back to the Yellow Queen after a month. He did not warn them, and when the Yellow Queen came, he was gone, and his brothers-in-law were beaten for having it. They had to run to him and beg his help, which he gave.

She reached San Diego, late in the month; then, after loading cargo at San Francisco, she steamed to Pearl Harbor, on 19 May, for duty with Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet. Sailing in convoy 30 May, she steamed via the Marshall Islands to Iwo Jima, where she arrived 22 June. During the closing weeks of fighting in the Pacific Myrmidon operated at Iwo Jima, repairing, disbursing, and provisioning ships at that important American forward base. Following the Japanese surrender, she continued service and repair duties throughout the Pacific from the Marianas to Pearl Harbor. Late in 1946 she returned to the Gulf coast and was placed in a reduced service status in January 1947. She decommissioned at Orange, Texas, 7 July 1947, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She remained berthed with ships of the Orange Group for more than a decade. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 April 1960, and she was sold 21 December 1960, to River Equipment, Inc., of Memphis, Tennessee, and later resold to the Dravo Corporation, Neville Island, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 16 January 1961.

Smart, honest to a fault, and sometimes a bit hot-headed, Asuma is a very good officer, although he's often used by Goto as a lackey.

Nagumo is a by-the-book style captain (as opposed to Goto who will often use somewhat unconventional methods to meet a goal); she always keeps her mind on the job and never loses her cool. Often she talks back to her superiors when she disagrees with an order, and this is probably why she remains at the SV2 rather being promoted to another job more worthy of her skills. Despite her conventional mentality, or because of it, she is always there to lend a hand whenever Division 2 needs it. She shares an office with Goto, which means she sees a lot of Goto's layabout act ‚Äì and also is able to tell that Goto is a much more skilled police officer than he looks (their professional relationship might best be described as \\"interesting\\").

The phrase is derived from the resemblance that the emblems have to scrambled eggs, particularly when the embellishments are gold in color. Today the \\"scrambled eggs\\" emblem, in one form or another, has been adopted by the majority of the world's navies. Exceptions include the French Navy and Italian armed forces, which use, respectively, embroideries or different varieties of chin straps on the officers' cap bands to indicate seniority. Although the use of the term is principally military, some civilians (such as airline and merchant ship captains and (primarily in the United States) senior uniformed law enforcement officers) have similar embellishments on the peaks or visors of their hats. British and Commonwealth countries Sir Richard Dannatt wearing a service dress hat with gold oak leaf embellishments. In the British Armed Forces, and in the armed forces of several other Commonwealth countries, scrambled egg (singular) is a nickname for the gold braid (called an \\"oak leaf sprig\\") on the peak of senior officers' peaked caps, and by extension a nickname for an officer. Specifically, flag officers, general officers, and air officers have two rows of golden oak leaves, while commodores, captains, and commanders (Royal Navy), brigadiers and colonels (Army), and group captains (RAF) have one row. Amongst the one-star ranks there is disparity. Specifically, as Navy commodores are not classified as flag officers and Army brigadiers are not general officers, they only have one row of golden oak leaves. However, the equivalent (but lower in precedence) Air Force rank of air commodore is classified as an air officer and hence has two rows of golden oak leaves. Disparities also exist at the OF-4 rank level with Navy commanders having one row of golden oak leaves whereas their Army and RAF counterparts (lieutenant colonel and wing commander) do not have any embellishments on their peaks. United States United States Air Force General Nathan Farragut Twining wearing the service dress hat with silver cloud and lightning bolt embellishments for a 4-star USAF general officer occupying the position of CSAF or CJCS; hatband embellishment is limited to the CSAF and the CJCS. In the United States armed forces, \\"scrambled eggs\\" is the nickname for the golden oak leaf and acorn embellishments (known as fretting) on the bills (visors) of framed service and dress uniform caps (called service caps in the Army, combination covers in the Navy and Coast Guard, barracks covers in the Marine Corps) worn by field grade and general officers in the rank and grade of major (O-4) or higher in the Army and Marine Corps, and senior and flag officers in the rank and grade of commander (O-5) or higher in the Navy and Coast Guard. The embellishments are also on the service caps of (Army) warrant officers serving in the ranks of chief warrant officer 3 with the grade of (W-3) to chief warrant officer 5 with the grade of (W-5). Thus, Army Field Grade Warrant Officers (those in the grade of W-3, W-4, and W-5) officers have the embellished visors while Army Company Grade Officers, those in the ranks and grades of second lieutenant (O-1), first lieutenant (O-2) and captain (O-3), and Company Grade warrant officers,those in the ranks and grades of warrant officer 1 (W-1) and chief warrant officer 2 (W-2), do not. Commissioned Officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wear similar uniforms and wear the same embellishments as the Navy while Commissioned Officers of the Public Health Service wear similar uniforms and wear the same embellishments as the Navy or Coast Guard depending upon the duties they are performing. Majors (O-4) and higher ranks in the Air Force wear silver clouds and lightning boltshttp://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a1/publication/afi36-2903/afi36-2903.pdf in lieu of oak leaves, sometimes referred to as \\"farts and darts\\".Scrambled Eggs on My Hat*Whittingham, Richard. (December 1985). Saturday Afternoon: College Football and the Men Who Made the Day: Workman Pub Co. Phrase used to describe the passenger makeup on the train from Washington to Philadelphia for the Army-Navy game:\\"There were more scrambled eggs on the train than were served to the invading forces on D-Day\\" Majors (O-4), Lieutenant Colonels (O-5), and Colonels (O-6) wear silver clouds and lightning bolts where there are two clouds on each side of the visor while all Generals (O-7 to O-10) wear silver clouds and lightning bolts where there are three clouds on each side. Additionally, Generals serving as the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) or as the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS,VJCS) wears a row of silver clouds and lightning bolts around the cap band of their service caps or dress caps (refer to the photo of General Nathan Farragut Twining). The difference in grades when an officer assumes the wearing of embellishments is peculiar to the individual customs and traditions of each service, i.e., the Navy and Coast Guard consider the grade of O-4 to be a junior officer rank versus a senior officer, while the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps consider it to be a field grade officer rank. At the flag or general officer level, O-7 and higher, additional embellishments are added to distinguish them from the USN/USCG senior officer and United States/USAF/USMC field grade officer ranks.

By convention this is reserved to Captains or Deputy-Captains (of four-striped rank), in contrast to the Anglo-American naval traditions, where officers of Commander rank and above are entitled to it. Moreover, in the case of airline pilots, such \\"leaves\\", may be oak-leaf or laurel-leaf, may be gold or silver in colour, depending on individual airline uniform. Law enforcement, fire and public safety Many American police chiefs, sheriffs and command staff law enforcement officers such as assistant chiefs and majors may wear scrambled eggs on their ball caps or dress covers' visors. Additionally, fire chiefs, rescue squad chiefs, assistant chiefs, senior fire marshals and other senior ranking personnel such as battalion chiefs may also wear scrambled eggs on the visors of their ball cap and dress cover visors In 1969, the Seattle Pilots of MLB's American League wore caps with gold scrambled eggs on the visor. The team failed financially, however, and moved to Milwaukee to become the Milwaukee Brewers. This was the only time in the history of major league baseball where a visor had any embellishments.

Background Written in June 1940 by Isaac Asimov, the story is fantasy rather than science fiction and based on an idea from Asimov's friend Frederik Pohl. After John W. Campbell of Unknown rejected \\"Legal Rights\\" in July, Asimov gave it to Pohl, who rewrote it (using the name James MacCreigh) and renamed it \\"Legal Rites\\", which Asimov agreed was a much better title. He sold it seven years later to Weird Tales which published it in September 1950, after Asimov had forgotten about it. It is one of several Asimov stories that center about a courtroom drama, such as \\"Galley Slave\\". Plot summary Russell Harley travels to an isolated part of the American South-West to take possession of his inheritance, a ramshackle house known as Harley Hall, willed to him by his late uncle Sebulon Harley. Finding that the house is apparently haunted by a ghost, he flees in terror. In a bar, he is accosted by a mysterious stranger known only as Nicholls, who persuades Harley to let him place magical paraphernalia in and around the house in an effort to control the ghost. The ghost visits a lawyer, claiming to be the spectre of Henry (Hank) Jenkins who shared the house for many years and now claims squatters' rights. Despite attempts to mediate, the case comes to court. Harley's lawyer disputes the claimed legal rights of the ghost and demands evidence that the ghost is actually who he claims to be. Under the pressure of the proceedings, Harley breaks down and admits that he did know of the presence of the ghost and therefore is willing to clear out of the house. The judge of course finds for the plaintiff. At the conclusion of the case, Nicholls commiserates with Harley and his lawyer. He points out that the precedent now set means that ghosts in the state and the whole of the United States now have legal rights to haunt houses.

Until that period, the art was confined to small villages and didn't have a national presence. Influential dramatist Ediriweera Sarachchandra attributes this to the influence of Theravada Buddhism, which he believes to have \\"tended more toward solitary contemplation and the attainment of insight than towards congregational practices or participation in community life.\\"  History =Early forms Lionel Wendt Art Centre Dramas in Sri Lanka began first with ritualist performances of early polytheistic religions. Originating as masked dances intersnouring gods and ridding demons, these gradually became free of religion and organised forms of entertainment. These early dramas w With the arrival of Europeans and urbanisation, the Sinhalese began to view theatre as a serious and secular art. At first, urban dramas were derivative borrowing heavily from English drama, or from Parsi theatre musicals (nurti) and Bombay and South Indian operatic plays (nadagam). These catered to a small audience, and drew the ire of strict Buddhists who considered them worthless. They were further attacked by the development of a \\"Protestant\\" Buddhism, a revival of the religion that stressed strict adherence to its law. Therefore, the words kolam and nadagam took a connotation of something ridiculous or nonsense in Sinhala. It would take until the 1950s for serious Sinhala dramas to develop. With independence of Ceylon from Great Britain and a widespread appreciation of Sinhala culture, Ediriweera Sarachchandra led the movement for serious Sinhala theatre. Sarachchandra's work, which brought together elements of the early folk ritual and dance drama tradition with Western theatre methods and stage style, created a new genre of theatre that appealed to all classes.

The widespread establishment of professional police in England did not occur until the 19th century. With the rising crime rate and newspapers to bring this to the attention of the public, thief-takers arose to partially fill the void in bringing criminals to justice. These were private individuals much like bounty hunters. However, thief-takers were usually hired by crime victims, while bounty hunters were paid by bail bondsmen to catch fugitives who skipped their court appearances and hence forfeited their bail. Both types also collected bounties offered by the authorities. Sometimes, thief-takers would act as go-betweens, negotiating the return of stolen goods for a fee. However, they were often corrupt themselves, for example extorting protection money from the crooks they were supposed to catch. Government- funded rewards for the capture of criminals were a corrupting influence, leading directly to the Macdaniel scandal. Historical and political context England in the seventeenth and eighteenth century suffered a great deal of political and economic disorders that brought violence into its streets. This was particularly evident in the capital and its neighbourhoods, where the population almost corresponded to that of England and Wales together. In fact London was expanding at a fast pace, so that there were no precise division between wealthy and poor areas, the rich living next to the poor. A major cause was immigration: an impressive number of different cultural groups migrated to the big city in search of fortune and social mobility, contributing to saturate jobs availability and making cohabitation a difficult matter. Streets in the metropolis were dark at night, and poorly lit, which allowed the proliferation of criminal activities, since lawbreakers were difficult to spot in the dark. Night watchmen patrolling the streets at night were not a guarantee of security, but inefficient, not joining efforts with other figures for maintaining the peace, and sometimes corrupt themselves. The English judicial system was not very developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as it was based on the Statute of Winchester of 1285, which created a basic organisation for keeping the peace prescribing the contribution of all citizens for: patrolling the streets at night in turns, hurrying to the ‚Äúhue and cry‚Äù, serving as a parish constable for a period of time, and being armed with suitable objects for intervention in case of necessity. The seventeenth century The seventeenth century saw a peculiar phase of political and religious instability: the Glorious Revolution brought William III to reign over England, and the rise of violence in the streets of the capital because of the removal of armed soldiers from service; the government feared conspiracy and felt the urgent need to protect its currency from coiners and clippers; on the other side, a period of poor harvests contributed to deepen people's bad conditions and the issues of public security that poverty originates. A highwayman, from an old print. In this period property was the most valuable thing to people: for this reason, what affected citizens the most were property crimes. Theft was the most perpetrated crime, and the most tried at the Old Bailey: it was mainly caused by hunger and poverty, but also by the aspiration to social mobility. Common petty crimes such as shoplifting or theft by servants became more and more frequent, later culminating with the pressure for turning them into capital offences as deterrent. Stealing from shops that exposed their luxury good in their windows was a great temptation to women in particular, who desired to have the latest fashion or imitate the higher social class style. Furthermore, the freedom of travelling safely was connected to the importance of commercial trades, hence, attacking people on the main roads was a threat to the economic system and already a capital offence. Those who committed thefts or robberies on the King's Highways, namely the streets of London and its major surrounding roads, were called Highwaymen. These individuals were often brutal and worked together in gangs carrying weapons with them to commit robberies with violence. Gangs were particularly feared because of their alleged connection with political dissidence and plotting. The counterfeit of money and clipping were as well a danger to the economy of the state, as they diminished the actual value of hard cash and increased the inflationary pressure. This practice was to be reduced with the Great Recoinage of 1696. In addition to the financial issue, coiners were thought to be politically involved with the Jacobites in plotting against the king. Along with the rise of criminal issues, concern with morality started to be taken into account since they were thought to be highly connected: sinning and breaking the law were the two sides of the same coin. This belief led to the Reformation of Manners campaign against brothels, which were thought to be frequented mostly by criminals. Homosexuality was another moral target for The Societies for the Reformation of Manners, who made use of informers to bring to an end the business of molly houses and sentence homosexuals to death. In the 1690s the criminal activity became so critical that it urged the government to take alternative measures: a series of rewards were introduced by statute to stimulate the prosecution and conviction of felons. The eighteenth century Another dark period of disorders and a climate of violence marked the 1720s. England became involved in the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702, which lasted until 1713, and brought a number of armed ex-soldiers to wander along London streets, who played a part in the rise of violent crime. Moreover, in the years following the war the city was ground for violent riots and protests against the state, subversive political dissidents, conspirators and Jacobite affiliates. The Old Bailey in the Gordon Riots, 1780 After the wild speculation of the South Sea Bubble, which brought a serious financial crisis to the economy of England and ruined a great deal of people, criminal attacks increased to such a great degree of frequency and brutality that the government was compelled to take increasingly harsh measures for felonies: in 1718 the parliament approved the Transportation Act, also known as the ‚ÄúJonathan Wild's Act‚Äù, which became law on 10 May 1719; in 1723 the Black Act intensified the severity of punishments for a greater number of offences, reaching the level of 350 capital crimes. The Gordon Riots of 1780, occasioned by the Catholic relief bill of 1778, were of the last manifestations of extreme violence in the streets of London: they caused a great deal of property damages, and the killing of many demonstrators by police force. The Old Bailey courthouse was badly attacked, and its furniture damaged and burned. Such excess of violence became abhorrent to the public and marked the desire for less sanguinary punishments. Law enforcement in the 17th and 18th centuries A city of London Watchman drawn and engraved by John Bogle, 1776 In the seventeenth and eighteenth century an official organism for law enforcement did not exist: chasing and arresting serious offenders was not the duty of the public authority. In fact night watchmen, constables and justices of the peace were not obligated to prosecute felons, but played a marginal role: night watchmen only provided surveillance for petty crimes, made rounds at night as a deterrent, and hosted those felons on hold to be brought before a justice of the peace the next day; while constables passively arrested people charged with a crime when already apprehended, and took them before a justice of the peace. As a consequence, law enforcement was mainly a private matter. Capture, prosecution and provision of evidence for the conviction of serious offenders in trials were at the expense of the victim. Moreover, all individuals were legally expected to report crimes that came to their notice, and answer any call for help - which usually were widely agreed expressions such as: Stop thief!, Murder!, or Fire! - by becoming involved in running after, detecting and catching felons. During the eighteenth century, the pursuit of criminals, involved common people to a lesser extent due to a series of factors. At the end of the seventeenth century population in London was incredibly growing and the city borders expanding thanks to the favorable economic situation that attracted a great number of immigrants escaping from poor life conditions. In such circumstances it was arduous to spot and find guilty suspects in the capital; and victims were afraid of organized criminals and their violent reprisal. In addition, defendants hardly suffered the consequences of their actions in trials, and felonies were for the most part not even identified. Property was of the biggest concern to inhabitants and public administration, hence theft of any kind was considered a serious crime, along with coining. In the Proceedings of the Old Bailey, theft, except robbery (violent theft), emerges as the type of crime tried the most at the Old Bailey. Prosecuting was expensive and took considerable time, yet it did not ensure the return of the stolen goods to the victim. Consequently, victims started to pay private individuals to conduct investigation and provide evidence for conviction. Likewise public authorities begun to offer rewards to people actively involved in the conviction of felons or the betrayal accomplices. Those men implicated in the catching of thieves for financial purposes were called thief-takers. The Daily Courant was the first daily newspaper to be published in the United Kingdom. It was established in 1702, but is no longer in existence. One of the first advertisements that Jonathan Wild put to run his brokering business was on the Daily Courant of 26 May 1714. Newspapers and crime literature A notable fact that contributed to mark the perception of crime in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is the booming interest for crime literature. The acts of the capital crimes tried at the Old Bailey were first published in 1674. ‚ÄúThe Proceedings of the Old Bailey‚Äù were only few pages reporting short summaries of the trials. At the beginning of the eighteenth century part of the original speeches pronounced in trials by prisoners, prosecutors, witnesses and judges started to be printed for the cases thought to be more entertaining for the public; the length was increased, the content reorganised and a space for advertisements created to compete with newspapers in captivating new readers. Daily newspapers started to be printed more frequently, thus playing an important role for the business of thief-takers. They were used by people to advertise their \\"lost\\" goods, offering a reward to induce private individuals to look for and bring back to the owner the belongings that were actually stolen: in fact, prosecuting criminals was difficult and expensive, but it did not ensure the property back. Jonathan Wild took great advantage of the possibility newspapers offered, and managed to increase his profits in the trade of returning the stolen goods by advertising his brokering services in the press; his business grew so profitable that Wild could establish a \\"lost property office\\", where people could go and ask for help in finding their missing goods. The profession of thief-taking ¬£20 reward offered for information in Kidderminster house burglary, 1816. There is evidence that thief-takers were active since the late sixteenth century, paid by both private citizens and public authority. The practice of hiring thief-takers continued to grow during the next century keeping pace with the exponential growth of the population and the better economic conditions. The national government started to be more concerned with crime in the 1690s, leading them to draw upon thief-takers to a greater degree, and to introduce permanent rewards, which were meant to encourage citizens to participate more actively in bringing serious criminals to the justice. This behaviour induced several people to start making their living by dedicating to thief catching as a specialized profession. Several thief-takers were previous criminals who faced the danger of being sentenced to death, but could rescue themselves thanks to the possibility of being pardoned for being instrumental in convicting other defendants, that is to say, for betraying their fellow criminals in trial. Prosecuted felons who managed to save their lives found in collaborating with constables and magistrates a suitable business for them, and a safer option than continuing to risk death penalty for committing serious offences. In fact, convicting perpetrators required a substantial degree of expertise in the criminal underworld, which administrations had not and would have paid for. Skilled thief-takers gained considerable power and reputation among their legal and illegal acquaintances: they were able to move at the limits of legality by taking personal advantage of their insight into the criminal world as well as of the crucial role they fulfilled in active policing for the public institutions. Statutory rewards were not the only responsible for the growth and settlement of such a new profession. In addition to this, thief-takers exploited the demand for arranging the return of stolen goods for a fee advertised in newspapers by the victims of theft, who preferred to have their belongings back than to engage in the costly and uncertain prosecution of their attackers. Furthermore, thief-takers were involved in a series of hidden activities that provided them with further sources of income: indeed acting as intermediates among different worlds offered plenty of temptation for corruption. Magistrates were aware of the dark side of thief-takers, but concerns with crime and the rise of criminal gangs, and no official active police force available, were some of the causes that obliged them to suffer thief-takers as effective instruments to reach the conviction of felons and to seal the gap in the judiciary system. Overt and hidden activities Thief-takers met the demand for policing that public authority boosted; they also made their skills known at any chance and took advantage of their public role to gain respectability among citizens. This overt conduct also provided thief-takers with a safe front for illegal activities. In fact, their expertise in the criminal world attracted and satisfied miscellaneous needs, ranging from magistrates to victims, and even to criminals, generating a new series of hidden illegal activities that increased profits and corruption. They were able to handle opposite necessities by acting as intermediary figures, while profiting of a well built set of intricate relationships. Thief-takers provided services of active policing and law enforcement for a gratuity, and were hired by both private citizens and institutions, which lacked in an organised police force. Thief- takers were usually paid for: revealing crucial information about felons that could lead to their apprehension and prosecution; investigating on felonies; detecting and apprehending criminals; providing instrumental evidence against the accused, which could lead to the conviction and to the desired reward. Thief-takers also worked alongside with the city officers in searching suspects for the goods stolen, and arresting them. With the Reformation of Manners campaign, new impulse was given to prosecutions, and therefore, to become a thief-taker. Charles Hitchen and Jonathan Wild contributed substantially in increasing the amount of prosecutions of this kind in the 1720s and 1730s. Jonathan Wild sits in Newgate Prison, with his account book on his knees. Wild continued, while in prison, to keep his \\"list\\" of goods that came into his office and the money paid for them. The oldest banknote known issued by the Bank of England of 19 October 1699, value ¬£ 555. If stolen, it would have been a serious loss for the owner, Thief-takers also offered mediation services between victims and criminals, arranging the return of stolen goods for a fee. The law system had been strengthened, but it did not guarantee the return of stolen goods to the victims in case offenders were convicted: hence, especially for traders, it provoked a loss to their business. Furthermore, in some cases victims were not very willing to prosecute and be responsible for the death of their attackers: first, because death penalty was the only kind of punishment available for felonies, so it was felt to be too harsh sometimes; second, because the victim could undergo public humiliation for the immoral circumstances in which the theft took place. Therefore, they preferred to advertise the ‚Äúloss‚Äù in the newspapers and compound with thieves, than to engage in unworthy prosecutions. This is why many resolved to use the services of an intermediary. On the other side, Thieves had the need to sell the property they stole. Receivers were thought to be a major cause for the increasing number of thefts: in fact, without receivers, there was no other possibility for thieves to sell the goods they robbed with no questions asked. When dealing with receivers became more dangerous due to more severe punishments for those suspected of compounding a felony, thieves realised that it was less risky and of bigger profit to return what they took unlawfully. This kind of trade was highly implemented by the development of the press: newspapers gave the possibility to victims and mediation figures to advertise their rewards and services, so that they became acquainted with each other. For these reasons, thief-takers were an important resource to them. Yet thief-takers became notorious to the public because corrupt and involved in more serious concealed activities, which put them in a bad light; sometimes they were offensively called ‚Äúinformers‚Äù. Since negotiating with clients was dangerous as well, because in the case of being perceived as a receiver or to be compounding they could have been accused of felony, Jonathan Wild proved to be prudent in not actually receiving the stolen goods: he only took note on a book of the details of the stolen goods from the victim and left messages to discover where they were, managing to deceive victims into raise the reward to secure the return; or advertised the ‚Äúloss‚Äù on newspapers on behalf of the thieves, and then arranged the exchange. The advantage of this practice was that, in case things went wrong, he could inform about the thieves and get the statutory reward on their conviction. To gain more profits, thief-takers begun to control and direct criminals moves, thus converting into thief-makers. They induced people to commit felonies with the objective of later arrest and prosecute them to obtain the reward. Stephen MacDaniel and John Berry prosecuted even innocents to take possession of the reward for the conviction, Other activities included blackmailing felons to extort money for not prosecuting; using them in trials to give testimony against fellow criminals; or protecting criminals for a fee by informing them on unexpected visits of constables or other officers coming to arrest them. Charles Hitchen attempted to extort money even from owners of taverns to prevent them being robbed by criminals, but he was hardly beaten and renounced. Earnings and other benefits Thief-takers could count on several types of income and advantages from their legal and illegal activities, which allowed them to establish a lucrative business: * Private rewards: victims promised financial rewards to those who were able to catch criminals and lead to their conviction. They also advertised their stolen goods as ‚Äúlost‚Äù in newspapers offering to pay a sum of money to those who could find and bring their belongings back. * Public rewards: Before the introduction of statutory rewards, thief-takers claimed from public officers the reimburse for the operational costs incurred. Furthermore, a ¬£10.00 reward started to be paid for information leading to a conviction. **Statutory rewards: in the 1690s the state introduced exemptions and permanent financial rewards to encourage the prosecution of felons, which were given in case of conviction. During the following years their amount was to be raised due to an increasing concern with crime and moral issues: *** 1692: ¬£40.00 for the conviction of highwaymen. *** 1695: ¬£40.00 for the conviction of coiners and clippers. *** 1699: Tyburn Ticket for the conviction of burglars (later converted in a financial reward), horse-thieves and shoplifters. It consisted in the exemption from parish duties, such as serving as a constable or a watchman. *** 1706: ¬£40.00 for the conviction of burglars and house breakers. *** 1720: ¬£100.00 extra were offered in addition to the ¬£40.00 already paid for the conviction of serious offenders. * Authority's Protection: public authority safeguarded thief-takers as important instruments for the law enforcement of the capital. Thief-takers had in fact an ill reputation because of their actively prosecuting felons for profit, and were sometimes called with the condemnatory expression of \\"informers\\". * Royal Pardon: granted to felons in case they served authority with notice about fellow criminals that led to their conviction. Some defendants took advantage of this possibility and converted to thief-taking. * Protection fee: a monetary recompense thief- takers received from those criminals they agreed not to prosecute. * Extortion money: in some cases thief-takers blackmailed criminals and forced them to pay a sum of money to avoid prosecution. Public attitude toward thief-takers The public opinion reflected changing attitudes toward thief-takers' activities and methods. For the authorities, thief-takers played a dual role: they were extremely important for apprehending felons, but at the same time a negative influence on the whole process of enforcing the law. For criminals, thief-takers were useful for protection as well as arrangement of the return of stolen goods to the victim to obtain the advertised reward, which was a better bargain than dealing with receivers. This is one reason why thief- takers had a great knowledge of criminal networks. The dark side was that the supposed protectors had the information and power to blackmail felons to extort money, or to prosecute them for the reward, which they actually did to sustain their own credibility to the authority. For private citizens, thief- takers played a valuable role in managing to return the stolen goods for a fee, by negotiating or prosecuting the thief. This is why they were not perceived so negatively as informers were. But the news of misconduct provoked the rage of the public. Their dubious behaviour reached public attention also because of the rivalry between the two leading thief-takers: Charles Hitchen and Jonathan Wild. Hitchen became irritated by the great success of Wild, his former assistant, who took advantage from Hitchen's suspension from the place of Under City-Marshall to engage in more lucrative illegal activities. In 1718 Charles Hitchen resolved to write a pamphlet against the practice of thief- taking called: A True Discovery of the Conduct of Receivers and Thief-Takers, In and About the City of London: To the Multiplication and Encouragement of Thieves, Housebreakers, and other loose and disorderly Persons. In his pamphlet Hitchen denounces the ill practices of thief-takers, but the actual unspoken target was the very Jonathan Wild, whom he nicknames \\"The Regulator\\". Wild in turn replied anonymously rejecting the accusations and revealing particulars of Hitchen's own dubious past as a receiver and as a thief-taker, thus beginning a pamphlet war. 18th century illustration of perjurer John Waller pilloried and pelted to death in 1732 Jonathan Wild, the thief-taker, sitting on a cart, is pelted by the mob on his way to Tyburn. After the infamous cases of Charles Hitchen and Jonathan Wild, more bad light was cast upon the reputation of thief-takers when the MacDaniel affair was discovered. Corruption, extortion of money and the practice of convicting innocents for profit, or popular gentlemen highwaymen such as the famous Jack Sheppard, turned public opinion against thief-takers. This is evident when several thief catchers happened to be tried at the Old Bailey and given the punishment of being exposed in the Pillory. During the exposure, the mob violently beat them, sometimes even to death. Hitchen was sentenced to an hour of exposure in the pillory for attempted sodomy, but after half an hour he had to be rescued from the savage reaction of the public because his life was in danger. MacDaniel and his accomplices were so brutally attacked that the constables tried to rescue them before they were killed, but one of the gang was already dead because a stone crushed his head. The others were severely wounded, and two of them, including MacDaniel, died in prison for the absence of prompt medical treatment. Wild as well suffered the rage of the Londoners on his way to the place of execution: he was fiercely pelted with stones and repeatedly insulted by the mob, who rushed furiously to Newgate Prison and followed him while transported with an open cart to the gallows. Mention in the Proceedings of the Old Bailey \\"The Old Bailey, Known Also as the Central Criminal Court\\" In the records of the Proceedings of the Old Bailey there is no manifest presence of thief-takers. Thief-takers were habitu√© at the Central Court of London and participated to a consistent number of trials under multiple roles, but they are difficult to track down because they avoided to appear under the label of \\"thief-taker\\". Prisoners in fact attempted to save their lives by sometimes accusing prosecutors of being thief-takers. After the execution of Jonathan Wild, some defendants also begun to claim that they had been induced into committing a felony, thus exploiting the increasing unpopularity of thief-takers' activities in order to discredit the charge. In trials, thief-takers filled several roles: * prosecutor: thief-takers are difficult to find in cases of highway robbery, burglary or horse theft. * witness: thief-takers seldom appear as witnesses in trials of theft, but more frequently in those of coining, for which they were essential for providing effective evidence against the accused felons. * victim: they could fake to be the victim of a theft. The MacDaniel gang specialised in this business. In order to gain the reward of the prosecution, they persuaded young inexperienced thieves to commit a theft on a member of the gang, while the other members hurried at the hue and cry to apprehend the thief. They also accused innocent people: perfect strangers that witnessed a theft came to help the supposed victim, who in reality was a member of the gang; in a second moment, thanks to the involvement of a corrupt constable, the charge of theft was shifted to the passer-by. * defendant: authorities knew thief-takers were acting at the limits of legality, and attempted to prosecute them when possible. Jonathan Wild was tried for theft and perverting justice, but acquitted of the first charge and sentenced to death for the second. The MacDaniel gang was tried for perverting justice and sentenced to pay a fine, be exposed twice in the pillory, undergo seven years of imprisonment, and find someone who could guarantee that they maintained a good behaviour during the three years after their imprisonment. Charles Hitchen was tried for sodomy and assault with sodomitical intent: he was acquitted of the first and found guilty of the second. He was punished with a fine, and imprisonment after being exposed in the pillory. A polished image: the Bow Street Runners Thief takers played and important role in the development of the modern police force. After the execution of Wild, the Thief-Taker General and corrupt criminal, a void in law enforcement emerged, and public officers nearly repented his death: the number of apprehensions, prosecutions and hangings had decreased significantly, as well as the readiness for the retrieval of the stolen goods. Despite the increasing unpopularity of thief-takers, whether it was for the dubious methods of Wild, or the scandal generated by the criminal gang of MacDaniel, rewards continued to be paid to stimulate thief-taking, thus validating those figures involved in active policing. Thief-takers were essential to the authorities for an effective and efficient law enforcement. By force of the adverse circumstances, it was an arduous task for the public authority to detect, apprehend and prosecute felons all alone. Bow Street Magistrate's Courtroom at 4 Bow Street, in London. The Bow Street Runners were London's first professional police force. In 1751 the novelist Henry Fielding wrote a pamphlet entitled Enquiry into the Causes of the late Increase of Robbers, in which he tries to restore the good image of thief-takers, showing how valuable they were for law enforcement and how dangerous for their life it was to secure criminals to the justice: the ill behaviour of a few did not have to erase the laudable services they performed for the community. Henry and his half-brother John also established a primitive form of organised police force: they hired thief-takers and former constables to go from their magistrate's office in Bow Street and investigate, catch criminals or recover stolen goods. At the beginning the payment was in rewards, but later these men also received a weekly wage of a guinea. To keep distance from the negative opinion of thief-takers, he also decided to give a new name to those under his service, that is Runners. At the beginning the public was not very willing to this new organisation of law enforcement because the ill practices of thief- takers were not forgotten yet, and it meant also moving a step closer to the establishment of a professional form of policing as in France. The English feared a change in the direction of the French law enforcement system, because the French law was perceived as too intrusive: a loss of the traditional liberties the English were proud of was unacceptable for many. The Bow Street Runners reached quickly the public awareness and approval thanks to the success in defeating a notorious gang of robbers in 1753, and to the massive advertisements published by John Fielding in the newspapers. Sir John Fielding managed to create a standing group of Runners, and to introduce improvements in the policing system. For example, he proposed more rules to control receivers and pawnbrokers, the creation of a policing group that could move with horses to be quicker in the pursuit of criminals, and the sharing of information among the several parts of the country, so that criminals would not have escaped prosecution so easily. Notable thief-takers Jonathan Wild is perhaps the most notorious thief-taker. He operated in London and by the 1720s, was a famous and popular figure. However, he actually led a gang of thieves; he would arrange the return of property stolen by his own underlings. To keep up the belief that he was working legitimately, he would even hand over members of his gang, who would inevitably end up being hanged at the Tyburn Tree. When this was discovered, he himself was hanged for theft in 1725. Wild was a buckle maker of Wolverhampton that decided to move to London. There he indebted and was imprisoned. While in prison, he developed acquaintances with officers and criminals. He then became Charles Hitchen's assistant and learned the business of arranging the return of stolen goods. Taking advantage of his master's suspension from the office of under-marshal, he advertised his own Lost Property Office and extended the business to a wider range of illegalities by starting to deal with serious offenders. To make the trade more lucrative he became a thief-maker, so that he could control almost all the criminal network and the business of stolen goods. His criminal activity included compounding, blackmailing thieves to extort money for not prosecuting, and sometimes prosecuting some of them to obtain the statutory reward and maintain credibility among the authorities. Charles Hitchen was a former craftsman of wooden furniture that exploited his wife's estate to buy the position of under-marshal of the city of London in 1712. This office was a vehicle to engage in more lucrative criminal activities under the protection of a respectable role. In addition to thief-taking, he could improve the trade of stolen goods by making use of his authority: he intimidated young thieves to force them to deliver the stolen property to him; in a second moment he tracked down the owner and tried to oblige him to pay a reward to have the property back. Despite the complaints about his belligerent methods, he managed to maintain the place because he alleged to be able to reduce the increased wave of crime generated by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Hitchen was only suspended for a short period of time, during which his assistant Jonathan Wild took advantage of his master's absence to go beyond the mediation practice and expand to a wider range of more serious illegal activities. The competition between Hitchen and Wild generated a \\"pamphlet war\\": Hitchen wrote a pamphlet called: A True Discovery of the Conduct of Receivers and Thief-Takers in and about the City of London in which he denounces the ill practices of thief-takers, but Wild was the main unspoken target. Wild replied in the same way accusing him of abusing of his office to make a trade of stolen goods, and revealing his homosexuality. Hitchen in turn wrote another pamphlet entitled: The Regulator, or, A Discovery of the Thieves, Thief-Takers and Locks to try to discredit Wild and, in this way, his accusations of homosexuality. However, under the influence of the moralistic campaign of the Societies for the Reformation of Manners, he was tried in 1727 for sodomy, which was a felony, but found guilty only of assault with sodomitical intent and sentenced to pay a fine, be exposed in the pillory and imprisoned for six months. He was also discharged from his place of under-marshal for not complying with his job functions. Stephen MacDaniel was a craftsman who made knives for a living, an officer at Marshalsea Prison, and a public house keeper. He was a brutal armed man that became thief-taker after escaping the gallows for betraying his fellow criminals. He used to work in a gang, and together they organised traps to falsely incriminate innocents in order to gain the statutory reward from their conviction. MacDaniel and his gang were finally discovered thanks to the evidence given by one of gang and tried at the Old Bailey: they were sentenced to pay a fine, be exposed in the pillory, be imprisoned for seven years and prove to be well behaving during the three years after imprisonment. MacDaniel survived the pillory because he was rescued before being killed, but two members of the gang who were also pilloried died from serious injury-related wounds. John Whitwood was hired by public officers to investigate, seek and arrest criminals, sometimes with the help of other fellows. He was also a receiver of stolen goods into the trade of returning them to the victim to gain the reward, organised thefts and blackmailed the thieves he dealt with to make more profit. Anthony St Leger was a young housebreaker, robber and burglar that became thief-taker after being pardoned in trial for giving evidence against the rest of the gang. He took advantage of his knowledge and experience in the criminal underworld to start making money with rewards or extortions for not prosecuting. Anthony Dunn was a highwayman and burglar that operated in a gang. He escaped the gallows by obtaining the royal pardon as well as a reward for being instrumental to the conviction of his fellow criminals. After this, he decided to become thief-taker: he started to work together with St Leger in the lucrative prosecution of coiners, clippers and highway robbers. James Jenkins was jeweller and an active thief-taker that dedicated mainly to restoring morality under the influence of the Reformation of Manners Campaign. For this reason he happened to be attacked and insulted with the negative label of \\"informer\\". He appeared in cases of larceny, rape, clipping and coining, together with his associate Rewse. Bodenham Rewse was an embroiderer and very active thief-taker in prosecuting promiscuous women for the Societies for the Reformation of Manners. He became also involved in the prosecution of highwaymen and plotters. He collaborated with the warden of the Mint in the pursuit of coiners, clippers and counterfeiters, especially together with Saker. With the profits made with the rewards he managed to buy the position of head turnkey of Newgate Prison. Robert Saker was a thief-taker of coiners and clippers in particular. He worked in collaboration with other thief-takers such as Dunn and Rewse, with the constable John Hooke, and even with his wife, Mary Miller, in setting traps for the apprehension of criminals. John Connell was a thief-taker that operated together with his wife Mary in the business of prosecuting for profit. They engaged in pursuing highwaymen, coiners and clippers, but were also corrupt and blackmailed felons to extort money. John Gibbons owned an official position for the government and took advantage of his role to become a corrupt thief-taker: he pretended to pursue coiners and clippers, but he actually protected them from being prosecuted in exchange for money.

It continues north out of Brighton before curving back west to rejoin Midland Highway at a roundabout. History The road that preceded the bypass was constructed in the early 19th century to facilitate communication between the north and the south of Tasmania. During the majority of that period Hobart inbound and outbound freight was always transferred via the Port of Hobart or the rail line. The motivation to construct the bypass was demonstrated 20 years ago, when freight in the Port of Hobart declined in favour transporting cargo to the ports to the north of the state. The Southern Railway Line had become outdated due to years of poor maintenance and was no longer an efficient alternative to road transport. Planning In 2007, the Lennon government released the Southern Transport Investment Program, a comprehensive Transport study which marked a clear plan and timetable for constructing the bypass. The bypass is designed as a fully grade separated Dual carriageway Highway from the Bridgewater roundabout to just north of Pontville. The sweeping Bypass has been designed to be safe and provide a high level of service. Completion of the bypass also facilitates a seamless connection to the Brighton Transport Hub and provided an opportunity in its construction to realign the south line in certain sections. After intense lobbying on behalf of the State government and councils involved, the construction of the bypass became a Federal election issue, with both major parties pledging financial support towards its construction. Construction In January 2009 the Rudd Government approved 10.5 million dollars to start excavation work on the Bypass, with the state government describing it as \\"the biggest infrastructure project in southern Tasmania\\". The new dual carriageway road will be built concurrently with the $79 million southern transport hub. The project was fast-tracked as part of the Federal Government's economic stimulus package. Funds from the Rudd Government are paying for the Brighton bypass, while the Tasmanian government is funding the road and rail freight transport interchange at Brighton. Construction commenced in April 2009 - a month early. During May 2010, Lara Giddings announced the opening of Glenstone Road. Constructed as the Brighton Transport Hub Link Road, the road has detoured the traffic flow around the Midland Highway in the area of the Brighton Industrial Estate to enable construction of the bypass in that area. Opening The southernmost 2 km stretch of the Brighton Bypass opened to the public on Monday 13 December 2010, while the official opening of the Bypass was on Monday 12 November 2012 \\\\- four months ahead of schedule. One year after opening, the traffic volume on the Midland Highway in Brighton had decreased by 42%, from close to 11,000 vehicles a day to less than 6400. Aboriginal heritage issues The Brighton Bypass remains controversial because of the Tasmanian government's refusal to properly investigate the proposed road corridor for Aboriginal sites prior to construction. In September 2009 local Aboriginals conducted a protest at the Jordan River crossing of the proposed road, stating that construction would destroy an Aboriginal site of potential world significance. Over the next few days, twenty protesters were arrested while attempting to halt work on the bypass. Local Aboriginal activist Michael Mansell called for the bypass to be scrapped stating that to continue \\"would be cultural vandalism, on an extreme scale\\". In February 2010, the aboriginal community gave archaeologists permission to excavate the site, after the state government agreed to consult more closely with it about the cultural values of the site. Jordan River Levee The Jordan River Levee bridge under construction Protests taking place on 15 April 2011 In March 2010, with construction well advanced an archaeological excavation of the Jordan River Levee uncovered stone tools dating back more than 30,000 years. In response, the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) placed construction on hold in that section of the project as well as commissioning peer reviews of the findings which were inconsistent with the findings of the original report. There is a range of opinions on the merits of both the original study and the peer reviews. The government estimated the cost of the bridge at $5 ‚Äì $10 million and claimed that its construction would protect the site. The local aboriginal community rejected the bridge proposal and immediately appealed to the Minister of Heritage, David O'Byrne. Over the following weeks, representatives of the aboriginal community negotiated with the government over the site. They suggested the government re-route funds from their failed Tarkine road project into diverting the bypass around the Levee. They proposed to have the road follow the train tracks before crossing the Jordan River. The government rejected this idea, as funding for the Tarkine road was designated for the north-west of the state and creating a diversion in the sweeping bypass would lower the speed limit, create unsafe geometry, and be almost impossible to build without altering the site of the rail bridge. The aboriginal community then released an amended plan proposing to have the highway cut through the southern tip of the Brighton Suburb. The government rejected this proposal also, stating that the amended plans would cost an additional $60 million and not address all the safety concerns. On 17 December 2010, Tasmanian Aboriginals set up camp on the levee and vowed not to budge as bulldozers rolled in. They named the levee \\"Kutalayna\\". On 25 January 2011 Federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Anthony Albanese announced his support for the state government's preferred crossing of the Jordan River after the Independent review launched by the Federal government was finalised. The report's key findings stated that the alternative bridging options would increase the overall cost of the bypass by at least $127 million and delay its completion by up to 4 years while new planning and environmental approvals were sought. It also noted that changing the route of the bypass would add between $82 and $140 million to the overall cost of the project. On 6 March 2011, the protesters attracted 200 people to an open day held at Camp Kutalayna in a show of community support. Visitors were given a tour of the area and told of its cultural and historical significance. On 11 April 2011, Minister for Environment, Parks and Heritage, Brian Wightman approved a construction environmental management plan enabling construction to start on the Bridge. The following day The Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources said it was about to start constructing fences around the boundary of the construction site. The department said they would provide a fenced \\"safe zone\\" for Aboriginal protesters. They also said they were prepared for confrontation with protesters at the Jordan River levee site, but were hopeful protests would not escalate to a point where force would be required. Exits Most of the road is in the Brighton Council local government area, with the northern tip and interchange falling within the Southern Midlands Council.

He scored a then-world record 10 goals for the Germany national football team in a 16‚Äì0 win against Russia at the 1912 Olympics. He left Germany to escape the Holocaust, as he was Jewish, and ultimately emigrated to Canada. Biography A German Jew, he was exiled and fled Nazi Germany in 1937 because of the Holocaust and emigrated first to England and then in 1940 to Canada. His older brother was composer and architect Richard Fuchs. Fuchs debuted for the German national football team at the age of 18. He played for (1904‚Äì06, 1914‚Äì20), and Karlsruher FV (1906‚Äì14)‚Äîwinning the German national title in 1910, beating Holstein Kiel 1‚Äì0. In 1912, they lost the final against Holstein Kiel, 1‚Äì0. Between 1911 and 1913 he was considered the best centre in the world. During this time period he earned six caps, and scored 14 goals. Fuchs was part of the legendary attacking trio of Karlsruher FV with Fritz F√∂rderer and Julius Hirsch (who was killed in Auschwitz). He was the first German player to score four goals in a single match. He is remembered for scoring a world record 10 goals for Germany in a 16‚Äì0 win against Russia at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm on 1 July, becoming the top scorer of the tournament; his international record was not surpassed until 2001 when Australia's Archie Thompson scored 13 goals in a 31‚Äì0 defeat of American Samoa. This performance of 10 goals in one international match tied a record set by Sophus Nielsen at the 1908 Summer Olympics, which remained on the books until 2001. The German Football Association erased all references to him from their records between 1933 and 1945. He had the record of being the top German scorer in one match. He served in the German Army in World War I as an artillery officer, and was awarded the Iron Cross. In 1928, he and his family moved to Berlin. He was a member of the local tennis club Nikolassee e. V., but it barred him from membership in 1935. When, years after the Holocaust in 1972, German former player and national team coach Sepp Herberger asked the German Football Association vice president Hermann Neuberger to invite Fuchs as a guest or a guest of honour to an international against Russia on the 60th anniversary of Fuchs' performance for the German team, the DFB Executive Committee declined to do so, writing that it was not willing to invite Fuchs because it would have created an unfortunate precedent (as was pointed out, given that Fuchs was the last remaining former Jewish German international, the DFB's concern about creating a precedent was a difficult one to understand).

She is remembered in both Eastern and Western Churches for her piety as a married woman. Biography Gorgonia married a man of some influence in Pisidia, sometimes called Vitolian, and other times, Meletius. By at least one account, she is called the \\"pattern of a married saint.\\" She had several sons and three daughters, the most notable of whom was named Alypania. Later in her life, she converted her husband, and was baptized along with him and her sons and grandsons. Gregory the Theologian eulogized Saint Gorgonia as \\"The Diamond of Her Sex\\" Two times in her life, she was miraculously cured of serious maladies. The first of these was her having been trampled by a team of mules, causing her broken bones and crushed internal organs. Yet, Gorgonia would have no doctor, as she thought it indecent. According to the legend, it was this modesty which cured her. Another time, she cured herself of a desperate illness by anointing herself with \\"the sacred elements of the Eucharist\\" mixed with her own tears, which she had shed with her head on the altar. She was cured of this disease as she was of the first, the symptoms of headache, fever, paralysis, and sporadic coma disappearing, allegedly, through the strength of her prayer. Gorgonia died circa 375 of natural causes. Her father and mother were alive, though extremely old, at the time of her death. At her funeral, her brother Gregory of Nazianzus the Younger preached a eulogy which declared her a model Christian spouse and mother, as well as \\"The Paragon of Women\\" and \\"The Diamond of Her Sex.\\" Veneration Saint Gorgonia is venerated as the patron saint of people afflicted by bodily ills or sickness. The legacy of her charity has earned her the titles \\"Mother of Orphans\\", \\"Eyes of the Blind\\", and \\"Keeper of a Refuge of the Poor\\" in the Greek Orthodox Church. Her feast day on the calendar of saints is 9 December in the West and 23 February in the East, the latter date purported to be that of her death.

Eighteen years later writer Gerry Conway re-introduced the Space Museum concept in \\"The Secret that Time Forgot\\" in Justice League of America #206 (September 1982), and in 1984 writer Paul Kupperberg followed in The New Adventures of Superboy #50 (February 1984), this in a 30th-century Legion of Superheroes framing sequence by Keith Giffen around a modern-day Superboy story by Kurt Schaffenberger. Two years later Dan Jurgens returned to the original 25th century Space Museum for the location of Booster Gold's origin story.Booster Gold #6 (July 1986). With the exception of the retrospective origin story of the Museum, \\"The Startling Secret of The Space Museum\\" in Secret Origins #50 (August 1990) by editor Mark Waid and Gerard Jones (with Carmine Infantino again returning to the artwork), and two stories set in the Museum - \\"When Robots Attack\\" in Legionnaires #68 (Feb 1999) by Roger Stern and Tom McGraw, and Booster Gold #0 (April 2008) - the few other references since have all been in retellings of or allusions to Booster Gold's origin.\\"From the Depths - The Secret Origin of Booster Gold,\\" Secret Origins vol. 2 #35 (1988); Adventures of Superman #476 (March 1991); Booster Gold vol 2 #1, (October 2007) and others. Fictional history=Strange Adventures - 1959 - 1964 Space Museum in Strange Adventures was an anthology series set in the 25th century featuring mainly unlinked heroic tales of outer space adventure; with a regular framing sequence that opens and closes each episode with the only continuing characters - Howard Parker and his young son Tommy (and on three occasions his mother) making their monthly visit to the Space Museum,Unusually for comics of the day, Tommy ages almost in 'real time'; he has several named birthday visits to the Museum and is clearly drawn physically older in later issues. later established as being in Metropolis.Booster Gold #6 (July 1986). It is a museum dedicated to showcasing the history of five centuries of human space travel, and features many exhibits in transparent display cases, each artifact from an adventure an Earth space traveller had had in outer space. The objects in the display cases are often ordinary, although somehow they were used to either save the Earth or some other planet from disaster: Behind every object in the Space Museum there's a tale of heroism, daring, self sacrifice.The opening story of the series, \\"The World of Doomed Spacemen,\\" Strange Adventures #104 (May 1959). During these visits Tommy always asks his father about one exhibit in particular, and Howard Parker then tells his son the story behind that exhibit, including: * a pair of contact lenses that deflected an aliens' attempt at manipulating brain waves;\\"The World of Doomed Spacemen,\\" Strange Adventures #104 (May 1959). * a pocket watch that saved a planet by preventing magnetic storms from destroying it;\\"Secret of the Tick-Tock World,\\" Strange Adventures #109 (October 1959). * a gold medal and a spaceship called Ike (the only time a story features two artifacts in the Museum);\\"Revolt of the Spaceships,\\" Strange Adventures #112 (January 1960). * a stuffed magpie called Tommy (after which Tommy Parker was named) that saved the Earth from an invasion of deadly jewels;\\"The Gem Invasion of Earth,\\" Strange Adventures #115 (April 1960). * an invisible being of pure energy;\\"The Billion-Year Old Spaceship,\\" Strange Adventures #121 (October 1960). * one of Tommy's mother's blonde hairs, in a story which reveals that she was Admiral Ann 'Blondy' Gordon of the Space Marines and his father General 'Wrecker' Parker;\\"Earth Victory - By a Hair,\\" Strange Adventures #124 (January 1961). * a toy soldier that helped defeat an alien invasion;\\"The Toy Soldier War,\\" Strange Adventures #130 (July 1961). * a search for the Fountain of Youth;\\"The Immortal Spaceman!,\\" Strange Adventures #133 (Oct 1961). * a race against time to save the Universe;\\"Second-Best Spaceman!,\\" Strange Adventures #136 (Jan 1962). * a man who discovered he could turn anything into a weapon;\\"Secret of the Energy Weapon!\\",\\" Strange Adventures #139 (Apr 1962). * a picture of Tommy, who had rescued his parents from aliens at the age of three;\\"Prisoners of the Space Flowers,\\" Strange Adventures #142 (July 1962). * a knitting needle used by Tommy's mother, then Ensign Gordon, to save Earth from aliens;\\"The Evolutionary Ensign of Space,\\" Strange Adventures #148 (January 1963). * an alien woman who appears in the Museum every few years in thanks for being saved by Alan Strange, a descendant of Adam Strange and his wife Alanna.\\"Rescue By Moonlight,\\" Strange Adventures #157 (October 1963). Only one tale does not fit into the normal narrative sequence, when Tommy and two of his friends in the Interplanetary Boy Scouts, using the skills Tommy has learned from the heroic stories he has been told, rescue Earth from aliens bent on stealing all its energy, and also rescue the Space Museum, which has been stolen by them.\\"The Mass Energy Robbers of Space,\\" Strange Adventures #145 (October 1962). Later appearances It is eventually revealed that the founding of the Space Museum, on the site of an old Military Surplus warehouse where hundreds of years worth of space history has piled up, came about because Tommy's father was a Space Marine guard there, and he \\"liberated\\" some of the momentoes, keeping them in his military footlocker.\\"The Startling Secret of The Space Museum\\", Secret Origins #50, (August 1990). Some of the relics he took are the same as referred to in the original Strange Adventures series - the contact lenses from \\"The World of Doomed Spacemen\\", Strange Adventures #104 (May 1959), the jewel from \\"Secret of the Space Jewel\\", Strange Adventures #106 (July 1959), the toy soldier from \\"Toy Soldier War\\", Strange Adventures #130 (July 1961) and the ray-gun from \\"Threat of the Planet Wreckers\\", Strange Adventures #118 (July 1960). Because of his knowledge of space history, Tommy's father recognizes aliens who had attacked Earth before\\"Threat of the Planet Wreckers,\\" Strange Adventures #118 (July 1960). trying again (by pretending to be scrap dealers and taking the artifacts from the warehouse to use as weapons against humanity). He is able to use the objects he has saved to stop the aliens, although demolishing the warehouse at the same time.hence his nickname - General 'Wrecker' Parker. His earlier wish (\\"People in my time have become jaded, bored with space travel. If only they were exposed to the heroism of Earth's star-spanning pioneers, their sense of adventure might be awakened\\".\\"The Startling Secret of The Space Museum,\\" Secret Origins #50, (August 1990).) is fulfilled when the military realize the value of \\"historical consciousness\\" and create the Space Museum on the site. The Space Museum also figures prominently in the origin of the superhero Booster Gold.\\"To Cross the Rubicon,\\" Booster Gold #6 (July 1986). In 2462this is around the time Tommy's visits to the Space Museum begin - he is specifically known to be aged about 15-16 in \\"Second-Best Spaceman,\\" Strange Adventures #136 (January 1962) - which is dated to 2471, so would have been 6 or 7 in 2462. There is an oblique reference to Tommy in Booster Gold's origin in Booster Gold #6 July 1986: \\"It was the enthusiasm of the children, I believe, on hearing tales of past adventures from their parents, that impressed Booster so deeply\\", coupled with frames showing a father and his young son going to the museum and looking at the exhibits. Michael Carter, a disgraced ex-football player is working as a night watchman in the Museum, and studies the history. He deactivates and steals Skeets, a robot Museum guard with an encyclopaedic knowledge of 20th century Earth history, together with an alien power suit, some power gloves and control bands, mystic power rods, a Legion Flight Ring, a forcefield belt, a credit card and other unspecified items from the displays, and escapes in Rip Hunter's Time Sphere, a time travel device from the 1960s, to journey back to the 1980s, become a superhero, and get rich and famous on the franchising opportunities.Originally Dan Jurgens had planned to have Booster Gold as one of the custodians of the Superman Museum who went back in time to show Superman how he should be a super-hero, but John Byrne's revamp of the Superman character meant a different origin was required - \\"Secrets Behind the Origins\\", a text piece by Mark Waid in Secret Origins #35 (1986). As an adult Tommy Parker took his own son Gardner to the Museum and told him a story of the exhibits,\\"The Secret That Time Forgot,\\" Justice League of America #206. something he had hoped for years before.\\"The Mass Energy Robbers of Space,\\" Strange Adventures #145 (October 1962). At some later point Ultra the Multi-Alien is known to have searched for the cosmic staff of Prince Gavin, Starman, as an artifact for the Museum.Starman vol 2, #55 (1999). Note: there is no clue as to where in DC continuity this James Robinson penned homage to the old Strange Adventures and Mystery in Space characters and stories fits. By 2984 the Space Museum has been renamed The Museum of Heroes and Legends, and has a whole wing dedicated to The Legion of Superheroes, as well as one to Earth's historical superheroes. That year one of the Dial H for Hero H-Dials is stolen from the museum by a petty crook while Chameleon Boy is attending a ceremony there. The villain escapes to 1984 with the help of the Dial, which is ripped to pieces by Krypto the Superdog before eventually being returned to the Museum in pieces by Chameleon Boy, where the Curator reveals they have another one.New Adventures of Superboy #50 (February 1984) note: no longer part of DC Universe continuity since the ret-con removal of Superboy, but next year who knows!A number of Internet sources state that The Time Trapper later either stole the second H-Dial, or it was stolen by Lori Morning of The Legion, however there does not appear to be any reference for this. The Museum appears to have been renamed the Time and History Museum some time later, and it is partly demolished by Xotar the Conqueror, a minor Justice League of America foe, on a mission to conquer the 30th century\\"When Robots Attack,\\" Legionnaires #68 (Feb 1999) - in which the Museum is shown to contain some inaccurate replicas of the Metal Men - Tin is a dog (in a confusion with Rin Tin Tin), and Jay 'The Flash' Garrick is a member. It also exhibits Star Hawkins' robot assistant Ilda, both the Golden Age Robotman and the Doom Patrol's Robotman exoskeltons, one of the G.I. Robots from Weird War Tales, a Cyberman and a Dalek (from Doctor Who), and the power lantern of Alan Scott the original Green Lantern.

Gordon had a career both in government and in academia, becoming a Professor of International Economic Relations at Harvard University in the 1950s, before turning his attention to foreign affairs. Gordon had a career in business after his resignation as president of the Johns Hopkins University, but remained active at institutions such as the Brookings Institution until his death. His full name was Abraham Lincoln Gordon, but he never used his first name.New York Times, December 21, 2009 Early life Born in 1913 in New York City, Gordon attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in Riverdale,Frederick N. Rasmussen, ‚ÄúLincoln Gordon‚Äù Baltimore Sun. December 22, 2009. and later attended Harvard University. As an undergraduate at Harvard, Gordon was involved with the university's glee club; because Prohibition was still in place, wine was usually served at the Club's parties. While he was a student at Harvard, Gordon met his future wife, Allison Wright, at a film exhibition in Dunster House. They married in 1937. He received a BA from Harvard in 1933. He received a DPhil from Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar in 1936. Career in government (1944‚Äì67) Gordon was program vice-chairman of the War Production Board from 1944 to 1945. He started in the Bureau of Research and Statistics of the War Production Board before joining the staff of the Requirements Committee, helping design the Controlled Materials Plan. This Plan regulated the conservation and allocation of critical materials such as steel, copper, zinc, and aluminum‚Äîmaterials that were scarce or were in danger of becoming so during World War II. Gordon then worked for the US State Department as Director of the Marshall Plan Mission and Minister for Economic Affairs and at the United States embassy in London (1952‚Äì55). \\"To let Western Europe collapse for want of some dollars,\\" Gordon has stated in regard to his role in the Marshall Plan, \\"would have been a tragedy. It would have been repeating the terrible mistake after World War I.\\" Brazil and Latin America (1960‚Äì67) In 1967. In 1960, Gordon helped develop the Alliance for Progress, an aid program designed to prevent Latin America from turning to revolution and socialism for economic progress. The journalist A. J. Langguth noted that many Brazilian nationalists scorned the Alliance as Brazilian foreign aid to America due to the belief that American corporations were withdrawing more money from the country than they were investing.A.J. Langguth, Hidden Terrors (New York: Pantheon Books, 1978), 65‚Äì66. Though Brazil did indeed run balance of payments deficits with the United States during the years of the Alliance, the size of these deficits was well exceeded by the grants and credits provided by the US to Brazil, even before factoring in development loans and military aid.US Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 1977 (Washington, D.C.), 855, 860-861, 864. Brazil also enjoyed large overall balance of payments surpluses during the Alliance years.Ethan B. Kapstein, \\"Brazil: Continued State Dominance\\", in The Promise of Privatization, ed. Raymond Vernon (New York: Council on Foreign Relations, 1988), 128. In 1961, Time reported that Gordon has \\"become Kennedy's leading expert on Latin American economics. Gordon drew up the U.S. agenda for the July inter-American economic meeting approved last week by the Organization of American States.\\" Gordon served as U.S. Ambassador to Brazil (1961‚Äì66), where he played a major role for the support of the opposition against the government of President Jo√£o Goulart and during the 1964 Brazilian coup d'√©tat. On March 27, 1964, he wrote a top secret cable to the US government, urging it to support the coup of Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco with a \\"clandestine delivery of arms\\" and shipments of gas and oil, to possibly be supplemented by CIA covert operations. Gordon believed that Goulart, wanting to \\"seize dictatorial power\\", was working with the Brazilian Communist Party. Gordon wrote: \\"If our influence is to be brought to bear to help avert a major disaster here--which might make Brazil the China of the 1960s--this is where both I and all my senior advisors believe our support should be placed.\\" Noam Chomsky has been critical of the coup, as well as his perception of Gordon's role in it. At an address delivered at Harvard University on March 19, 1985, he stated: Thomas Skidmore, a well-respected Brazilian historian and moderately Marxist professor at Brown University takes a notedly different view than Chomsky. While he acknowledges that the U.S. supported the Brazilian military, he notes that the credit for the coup belongs to the Brazilian military and not to the U.S.: In the years after the coup, Gordon, Gordon's staff, and the CIA repeatedly denied that they had been involved and President Lyndon B. Johnson praised Gordon's service in Brazil as \\"a rare combination of experience and scholarship, idealism and practical judgment.\\" In 1976, Gordon stated that the Johnson Administration \\"had been prepared to intervene militarily to prevent a leftist takeover of the government,\\" but did not directly state that it had or had not intervened. Circa 2004 many documents were declassified and placed online at the GWU National Security Archive, indicating the involvement of Johnson, McNamara, Gordon, and others. In 2005 Stansfield Turner's book described the involvement of ITT Corporation president Harold Geneen and CIA director John McCone.Burn Before Reading, Admiral Stansfield Turner, 2005, Hyperion, pg. 99.

Afterward, Gordon became Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs (1966‚Äì68) in Washington, D.C., and worked for the Alliance for Progress, which coordinated aid to Latin America. Career in academia Gordon was a Professor of International Economic Relations at Harvard University in the 1950s, before turning his attention to foreign affairs. Johns Hopkins University (1967‚Äì71) He then served as president of the Johns Hopkins University between 1967 and 1971. In 1970, following approval from the Board of Trustees in November 1969, he introduced coeducation in Johns Hopkins' full-time undergraduate program.Baltimore Sun, September 6, 1970 During his tenure, students and faculty briefly occupied the university's executive offices to protest against the Vietnam War Washington Post, December 22, 2009 despite the fact that Gordon had expressed opposition to the Vietnam War. He also took part in a campus-wide discussion over military recruiting on campus and whether ROTC should have a place at Johns Hopkins.Baltimore Sun, April 20, 1970, p. C7 During his tenure, the university was suffering a financial crisis, with an operating deficit of more than $4 million. The crisis caused Gordon to order budget cuts, which in turn caused faculty protests. Faculty were angered because while Gordon was cutting teaching positions, he was increasing the size of the University's administration. He also incurred student wrath when he re-wrote the student conduct code.Johns Hopkins University News-Letter, March 13, 1971 Gordon resigned in March 1971, following a vote of \\"no-confidence\\" by a committee of senior faculty,Johns Hopkins University News-Letter, March 19, 1971; Baltimore Evening Sun, March 13, 1971 attributing his resignation to growing criticism from the university's faculty.[18] The New York Times stated that \\"Dr. Gordon's four years at Johns Hopkins were dogged by deteriorating finances, faculty complaints over pay and academic priorities, and students rebellious over the 'relevance' of their educations.\\" Although Gordon had agreed to remain until an interim successor could be named, he left town abruptly, forcing the trustees to move quickly; they asked Gordon's predecessor, Milton S. Eisenhower, to return in an emergency capacity.Baltimore Evening Sun, March 13, 1971 Later career Lincoln Gordon in 2006. Gordon was a fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Smithsonian Institution from 1972 to 1975. In 1984, he became a scholar at the Brookings Institution (he was an active associate there until his death) and also became director at the Atlantic Council of the United States.

It is primarily found in Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Enterobactin is the strongest siderophore known, binding to the ferric ion (Fe3+) with the affinity (K = 1052 M‚àí1). This value is substantially larger than even some synthetic metal chelators, such as EDTA (Kf,Fe3+ ~ 1025 M‚àí1). Due to its high affinity, enterobactin is capable of chelating even in environments where the concentration of ferric ion is held very low, such as within living organisms. Enterobactin can extract iron even from the air. Pathogenic bacteria can steal iron from other living organisms using this mechanism, even though the concentration of iron is kept extremely low due to the toxicity of free iron. Structure and biosynthesis Chorismic acid, an aromatic amino acid precursor, is converted to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) by a series of enzymes, EntA, EntB and EntC. An amide linkage of DHB to L-serine is then catalyzed by EntD, EntE, EntF and EntB. Three molecules of the DHB-Ser formed undergo intermolecular cyclization, yielding enterobactin. Although a number of stereoisomers are possible due to the chirality of the serine residues, only the Œî-cis isomer is metabolically active. The first three-dimensional structure of a metal enterobactin complex was determined as the vanadium(IV) complex. Although ferric enterobactin long eluded crystallization, its definitive three-dimensional structure was ultimately obtained using racemic crystallography, in which crystals of a 1:1 mixture of ferric enterobactin and its mirror image (ferric enantioenterobactin) were grown and analyzed by X-ray crystallography. left Mechanism Iron deficiency in bacterial cells triggers secretion of enterobactin into the extracellular environment, causing formation of a coordination complex \\"FeEnt\\" wherein ferric ion is chelated to the conjugate base of enterobactin. In Escherichia coli, FepA in the bacterial outer membrane then allows entrance of FeEnt to the bacterial periplasm. FepB,C,D and G all participate in transport of the FeEnt through the inner membrane by means of an ATP-binding cassette transporter. Due to the extreme iron binding affinity of enterobactin, it is necessary to cleave FeEnt with ferrienterobactin esterase to remove the iron. This degradation yields three 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-L-serine units. Reduction of the iron (Fe3+ to Fe2+) occurs in conjunction with this cleavage, but no FeEnt bacterial reductase enzyme has been identified, and the mechanism for this process is still unclear. The reduction potential for Fe3+/Fe2+-enterobactin complex is pH dependent and varies from ‚àí0.57 V (vs NHE) at pH 6 to ‚àí0.79 V at pH 7.4 to ‚àí0.99 at pH values higher than 10.4.  History  Enterobactin was discovered by Gibson and Neilands groups in 1970. These initial studies established the structure and its relationship to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid.

He was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1924 in Toronto. In 1927 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.View/Search Fellows of the ASA, accessed 2016-07-23. As a researcher, he developed a well known statistical technique for estimating the ED-50, and his work with epidemiologist Wade Hampton Frost on the Reed‚ÄìFrost epidemic models also remains well known.

Lowell Reed attended the University of Maine, graduating in 1907 with a degree in electrical engineering. In 1915 he earned a PhD in mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania. This unusual combination of disciplines was put to use when he arrived at Johns Hopkins University in 1918, where he organized the Department of Biometry and Vital Statistics at the School of Hygiene and Public Health (now the Bloomberg School of Public Health) and was credited with coining the term \\"biostatistics\\". He became chair of that department in 1925 and, in 1947, was named vice president in charge of medical activities.Baltimore Sun, April 30, 1966; Baltimore Evening Sun, April 29, 1966 Reed retired from the Hopkins faculty in June 1953, only to be recalled later that summer to serve as president when Detlev Bronk departed for Rockefeller University. In September 1953, he returned to Baltimore from his home in New Hampshire to accept the presidency, stating, \\"For 30-odd years, I have had a glorious time at the Hopkins. I owed it to the people there to return.\\" Although he made it clear that he did not plan to serve indefinitely, he did not regard himself as a caretaker or interim president.

Named for Pandemus (a civic goddess in Egyptian and Greek mythology, perhaps of marriage, personifying earthly or common love), she has been the only U.S. Navy vessel to bear the name. Construction and commissioning Pandemous originally was laid down as the LST-542-class tank landing ship USS LST-650 on 20 July 1944 by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company at Seneca, Illinois. While under construction, she was reclassified as a landing craft repair ship and re- designated as ARL‚Äì18 on 14 August 1944 and named Pandemus on 11 September 1944. She was launched on 10 October 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Laura Sauter Gasperik, and placed in reduced commission on 21 October 1944 for transit to New Orleans, Louisiana, then decommissioned on 3 November 1944 for conversion to a landing craft repair ship by Todd Johnson Dry Dock, Inc..

She put to sea from Shanghai on 21 December 1945 and steamed by way of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to San Pedro, California, arriving there on 5 February 1946. She departed San Pedro on 11 February 1946 on her way to Mobile, Alabama, where she arrived on 3 March 1946. She shifted to Algiers, Louisiana, on 4 July 1946 and decommissioned there on 23 September 1946. 2nd commission, 1951‚Äì1968 Pandemus recommissioned at Green Cove Springs, Florida, on 14 December 1951 with Lieutenant John H. Thomas in command. After fitting out at Merrill Stevens Shipyard at Jacksonville, Florida, she visited Norfolk, Virginia, on 23 January 1952 and arrived at her new home port, the U.S. Naval Minecraft Base at Charleston, South Carolina, on 30 March 1952 and began 16¬Ω years of service supporting minesweeping operations along the United States East Coast from Newport, Rhode Island, to Key West, Florida, and in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.

He played college football at Kent State University. He was drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the third round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He also played for the Cleveland Browns. Early years Usama was born in the North East section of Washington D.C. to Dr. Khaula Murtadha and Leroi A. Young (1950-2016). Usama is the youngest son of their four boys. Usama Young attended Largo High School in Largo, Maryland and was a letterman in football, baseball, and track. He started to play football at the age of 8. As the youngest, Usama was given the opportunity to learn from his older brothers who pushed him to never cry, complain or make excuses. When Usama was 12 he was playing football in a local pee-wee football game. During the middle of the game a rabid dog ran onto the field and terrorized the young players, coaches and family members who were on the sidelines watching. To everyone's surprise the twelve-year-old Usama was able to tackle the dog, tie the dog up using the chains from the down markers and successfully restore order to the pee-wee football game. By the time Usama was a freshman in high school he developed a work ethic that would stay with him throughout his football career. As a senior in high school, he was a second team All-State honoree. Young graduated from Largo High School in 2003. He worked as a vendor at FedExField during home games of the Washington Redskins while in high school. This was revealed during the SuperAd that he and his father were featured in during Super Bowl XLIII. College career Young was regarded as one of the top defensive prospects to emerge from Kent State in the last three decades. A three-year starter, his collegiate career totals include starting 37 of 45 games, with 198 tackles (129 solo), three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries, nine interceptions with 21 yards in returns, 21 pass defenses and a blocked kick.

Brancaleone succeeded in conquering most of Sardinia, including the former free republic of Sassari, and extending Arborean control over the other provinces. Brancaleone Doria was the husband of Eleanor of Arborea. He was a scion of an influential family (the Doria) of the Republic of Genoa, the son of the elder Brancaleone and a woman named Giacomina. On 16 March 1357, he became a vassal of Peter IV of Aragon, the nominal King of Sardinia, to legitimate the possessions of his father on the island. When Hugh III of Arborea, Eleanor's brother, sought out a matrimonial alliance with Genoa, his choice for a brother-in-law fell on Brancaleone. The marriage took place in 1376, a political alliance only, for the Bas-Serra family of Eleanor was opposed to the royal pretensions of the House of Barcelona, to which Brancaleone was affiliated. Already at the time of his marriage, he had illegitimate children, Giannettino and Nicholas, by an anonymous woman. When Hugh was assassinated in 1383, Eleanor and Brancaleone's young son Frederick succeeded to the Giudicato of Arborea. At that time, Brancaleone was in Catalonia to receive the honorific title of \\"Count of Monteleone and Baron of Lower Marmilla.\\" As soon as Peter IV heard of the election of Frederick, he arrested Brancaleone and sent him to Cagliari, to be imprisoned first in the tower of Pancrazio and then in that of Elefante. Arborea was governed in the meantime by Eleanor. Frederick, later seized and imprisoned by Peter himself, died young and in captivity. He was succeeded by Brancaleone's second son, Marianus V. Brancaleone was finally liberated only on 1 January 1390. His fidelity to the Aragonese crown was by then broken. On 1 April 1391, Brancaleone marched on Castel di Cagliari and, on 16 August, occupied Sassari and Osilo with his son Marianus. In September, he conquered the castles of Fava, Galtell√¨, Bonveh√¨, and Pedreso. Only Alghero and Longosardo remained in Aragonese hands by then. On 3 October, he entered Villa di Chiesa. In a letter written at Sanluri on 3 February 1392, he announced having repossessed all the territories lost to the Aragonese in 1388. On 16 March, a fleet under Martin of Aragon appeared off Capo San Marco, conducted from Sicily for the purpose of putting down Brancaleone's \\"rebellion.\\" The attempt failed. Following Marianus' death, Arborea passed to William III of Narbonne. Brancaleone retired to his estates at Monteleone.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is counted as the 60th of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu. Vishnu is worshiped as Uppiliappan and his consort Lakshmi as Bhumi Devi. The temple is believed to be of significant antiquity and to have been initiated by the Medieval Cholas of the late 8th century AD, with later contributions at different times from Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple has two inscriptions dating from the Chola period, a five-tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower), and a granite wall. The complex contains all the shrines and water bodies associated with it. Uppiliappan is believed to have appeared for sage Markandeya and Hindu gods Bhoomadevi, Brahma and Shiva. The temple observes six daily rituals and three yearly festivals. The chariot festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of \\"Panguni\\" (March‚ÄìApril), is the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend thumb The history of the temple is mentioned in the Brahmanda Purana, one of the eighteen famed Hindu scriptures. Per Hindu legend, Tulasi once did penance to attain closeness to Vishnu. Vishnu responded that his consort Lakshmi would appear under Tulasi's lap in Tiruvinnagaram. Tulasi appeared in the place where the temple is located. This is mentioned in the 53rd verse of Nammazhwaar in Thiruviruththam. Markandeya Maharishi worshipped Vishnu and desired that Lakshmi should appear as his daughter and Vishnu should become his son-in-law. Once Markandeya was on a holy trip and after reaching Thiruvinnagaram, he felt it was the right place to get his desire fulfilled. Markandeya started a severe penance for thousand years, seeking Lakshmi's blessings. Lakshmi appeared as a baby under the already incarnated tulasi plant. Markandeya felt Lakshmi's presence in the form of the baby and realised that part of his desire had been fulfilled. He took possession of the baby and raised her. When the young girl reached adolescence, on the panguni month of Shravana, Vishnu appeared as an old man and asked for the hand of Markandeya's daughter in marriage. Markandeya replied, \\"You are very ripe and old, my daughter is too young and she does not even know how to cook with proper salt contents\\", to which the old man replied, \\"If your daughter must cook without salt, then I will still take it as my best food, but I will not leave from here without marrying her\\". Markandeya sought Vishnu's help and then realised using his penance that the old man was Vishnu himself. When he opened his eyes, Vishnu appeared in front of him with conch and chakram as in Vaikundam. Markandeya offered his daughter's hand in marriage. Per the legend, the temple's Neyvethiyam (food offering) is always prepared without salt. The name Oppiliappan is a result of this legend. There is also a story behind the tank in this temple. Once a King had consummated with a daughter of a saint and hence the saint cursed him to become a bird. The king lived as a bird and one night when there was a storm, the branch of the tree the bird was sleeping on broke and fell into the water of this tank. The bird regained its original form as the King and since then this is known as the only theerththam that one can do theerth thaadanam even in the night. Since this tank has such healing power in the day as well as night, it is called \\"Ahoraathra Pushkarani\\".Ayyar 1991, p. 348 The place is called by various names, including \\"Agasa Nagaram\\", \\"Vaikunda Nagaram\\", \\"Thiruvinnagar\\", \\"Oppiliappan Sannithi\\" and \\"Uppiliappan Sannithi\\". The presiding deity is also called by various names, including Venkatachalapathy, Thiruvinnagarappan, Oppilaappan, Thanoppillaappan, Uppiliappan and Srinivasan.Swamigal 2003, p. 14 History temple tank It is not clear from the inscriptions and records when the temple was initiated, but there are inscriptions from the Medieval Cholas period indicating generous gifts to the temple. There are two inscriptions recorded from the Naganathar Temple in Tirunageswaram. The epigraph numbered 211 of 1911 on the northern wall of the central shrine indicates gift of gold jewel worked in gems and pearls to the temple from the Chola king Parakesarivarman, alias Rajendra Chola I (1012‚Äì44 CE). The second inscription numbered 218 of 1911 on the shrine's southern wall indicates a gift of land to the temple in the 14th year of the Chola king Rajaraja Rajakkesarivarman I.Ayyar 1991, p. 344Swamigal 2003, p. 13 The tradition in many ancient temples in Tamil Nadu including this one is that the original image of the presiding deity is made of wood and replaced later with stone. There were a lot of additions made to the temple by Govinda Dikshitar, the minister of successive Nayak rulers, Achuthappa Nayak (1560‚Äì1614) and Raghunatha Nayak (1600‚Äì34). The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture Elephant and mahout walking through the pillared hall. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram (the gateway tower) and enshrined within a granite wall. The complex contains all the shrines and water bodies associated with it. The Sahasradhari plate and pot (kudam) are made of gold for performing Thirumanjanam (ablution) to the presiding deity. The temple also maintains golden sword, diamond crown and gold arm guard for the image of Hanuman. The shrine over the sanctum is plated with gold. The main shrine of the temple houses the image of Oppiliappan in standing posture and it also houses the images of Bhoomidevi and sage Markendeya. The vimana is called Suddhananda, meaning \\"pure happiness\\". The Desika shrine is located near the sancturn sanctorum. On the sides of the first precinct, the shrine of Anjaneya is located on the southern, and Alwars' and Sri Rama's on the northern and Ramanuja's on the eastern sides.The shrine for Maniappan is located in the second precinct in the southern side, while the shrines of Ennappan and the holy birth spot of Bhoomidevi are located in the northern side. Garuda's shrine is located right opposite the sanctum and right behind the temple mast. The shrine of dancing Krishna is located on the southern side of the main entrance.Swamigal 2003, p. 18 A marble hall is located on the western side in the inner precinct acts as the resting hall for the festival deities during festivals. Dolotsavam festival is celebrated in Another marble hall in the northern side of the temple. Adjoining the hall, there is a shrine where the images of Rama, Lakshmana, Sita and Hanuman are housed. The sacred bed chamber called Tiruppalliarai, covered full of mirrors is located next to it.A Yaga sala for performing religious rituals is present in the temple. The temple has a hall for housing festival vehicles, a library, and a hall with edight carved pillars on the banks of the temple tank, where the annual float- festival is celebrated. The Kodimandapa, located to the south of the Garuda shrine, is used for several day-to-day religious practices. The annual Kalyana Utsavam festival is performed in the hall amidst music and dance programmes. The temple is considered the southern counterpart of Thirupathi temple and hence devotees perform their marriages and vows as they do in Thirupathi.Ayyar 1991, p. 544 Outside the main complex, the temple maintains two marriage halls, a rest house containing five rooms, two other halls, a housing each for the small chariot and the big chariot. There is a garden around the third precinct of the temple and a much bigger garden about to the south of the temple, where Tulasi and flowers are grown. A hall in the garden is used for resting deities during the Vasantotsavam festival celebrated for six days in May‚ÄìJune every year. Festivals and religious practices View of the shrine from the temple tank The temple follows Vaigasana Agama and follows Vadagalai practices. During the Viswaroopa Seva, the first worship, Suprapada Prabarthi Mangalam, a verse exclusively dedicated to Uppiliappan is relayed. Thiruppavai is relayed after it, followed by naivethana in all shrines. Uchikalam is the last worship during the day time and happens at noon. During the evening, mutharkalam is the first worship sequence, recitals in Veda and Nithsuasandamam. Arthajamam is the last puja of the day.Swamigal 2003, p. 19 The chariot festival is the most prominent festival of the temple, celebrated for nine days during the Tamil month of Panguni (March‚ÄìApril) and devotees from various places pull the chariot round the streets of temple. Verses from the 'Nalayira Divya Prabandham' are recited by a group of temple priests amidst music with Nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and Tavil (percussion instrument). The processional idols of Uppiliappan and Bhumidevi are brought to the temple car early in the morning amidst Vedic chantings. Subsequently, the festive idols are taken to the 'ther thatti mandapam' (chariot launching hall). The 'ratharohanam', the rituals associated with taking the idols to the temple car is performed in an auspicious time before starting the procession. The temple celebrates six other festivals: Vasanta Utsavam (spring festival) for 6 days in the temple garden during Vaikasi (May‚ÄìJune), Pavitrotsavam (purifying festival) for 5 days during Avani (Aug ‚Äì Sep), Brahmotsavam for nine days of Purattasi (Sept ‚Äì Oct), Kalyana Utsavam (holy marriage of god and goddess) for 12 days commencing from Sravanam during Aippasi (Oct‚ÄìNov), Adhyayana Utsavam (ten-day-and-ten-night festival) during Margazhi (Dec‚ÄìJan) and float festival for 5 days during Thai(Jan ‚Äì Feb). Ramanavami, the festival associated with Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. The event is celebrated for ten days with music and dance performance and on the concluding day, kanakabhishekam (ablution with gold for the festival image) and Rama Pattabhishekam. Sravan Deepam is a festival celebrated every month in the temple on the day of Tamil star of Thiruvonam and devotees observe fast called Sravana Vratham that day by consuming only unsalted food. Tonsure ceremony for getting children shaved for the first time to promote proper growth and ear piercing is a very common practise followed in the temple. It is believed that the place is as sacred as Vaikunta and as in Vaikunta, the river Vraja there flows as river Nattaru and hence considered sacred. Literary mention Uppiliappan is considered the elder brother of the presiding deity of Tirupathi Venkateshwara Temple. The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Periazhwar, Thirumangai Azhwar and Nammazhwar. The temple is classified as a divyadesam, the 108 Vishnu temples that are revered in the Vaishnava canon. The temple is counted as the 14th in the list of divyadesams in Chola Nadu and 83rd in the overall list. The Azhwars address the presiding deity by various names like Uppiliappan, Vinnagarappan and Venkatachalapathy and his consort Bhumidevi as Bhoomidevi Nachiar and Dharanadevi.The Society 1994, p. 25 Periazhwar refers to Uppiliappan as Thiruvinnagar Mevvane in his verses in Periathirumozhi while Namaazhwar called him \\"Thannoppaarillappan\\", that is he who has no comparison, meaning there is neither an equivalent nor superior to Vishnu. He mentions \\"the Lord who by his powers affords solace for pining hearts and renders them fit for service\\".The Society 1994, p. 28 The temple is one of the most visited in the district.

About A new multimedia, and significantly updated, version of the English Talking Glossary of Genetics was released by the National Human Genome Research Institute in October, 2009. An identical update of the Spanish-language version was released in October, 2011. In September, 2011, an iPhone App of the English Talking Glossary was released by NHGRI and made available as a free download in the Apple App store. The App version contains all 3-D animations, high quality illustrations, the \\"Test Your Gene IQ\\" quiz, and similar user functions such as \\"Suggest a Term\\" and \\"Mail This Term to a Friend.\\" The original version had been based on simple HTML entries and was developed in the mid-1990s at a time when dial-up modems were commonly used to access the internet at speeds as low as 14.4 kps. That version of the Talking Glossary contained 178 terms and talking explanations of each term, as well as about 70 black-and-white illustrations. The new, and current, versions of the Talking Glossary featured a substantial visual, content, and functional upgrade to the popular online tool. The new Glossaries are built on a vibrant FLASH-based web design employing colorful pages, clear digital audio files, color illustrations, 3-D animations, a \\"Test Your Gene IQ\\" function, real-time applets to \\"cite a term in a paper\\", \\"suggest a term\\", and \\"share a term\\" via email. The list of terms was expanded to 256 entries. Terms were chosen using a number of metrics including a review of the online usage of the glossary over the previous decade. Some terms were dropped as a result, and a large number of terms were added. Other metrics used to determine terms included a scan of the most commonly used science books in U.S. K-12 classrooms for terms and concepts, review of all terms suggested by users using the glossary term suggestion function, and a scan of public media and scientific publications for terms. Developing the Talking Glossary: The Talking Glossary of Genetics is a science learning tool developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NHGRI oversaw the NIH's role in the Human Genome Project, the international research effort aimed at mapping the genes in the human body and developing tools for gene discovery. Many of the Talking Glossary terms are commonly used today in news reports, by researchers and medical professionals, in classrooms and, increasingly, as part of daily conversation. In this light, the Glossary was designed to enable people without a formal scientific background to better understand the terms and concepts behind genetic research. Special attention has been paid to users who are learning or teaching genetics in the classroom. However, the Glossary is designed to be valuable for a much wider audience including patients, doctors, nurses, parents, and professionals dealing with genetic concepts and terminology, such as judges, lawyers, law enforcement officials, and others. The process of developing the Talking Glossary began by examining some of the most popular American middle school and high school science textbooks. Genetics-related terms from these textbooks provided the foundation for the Talking Glossary. These terms are associated with biological concepts addressed by the National Science Education Standards and common in high school and college biology courses. Additional terms not found in textbooks were added to the glossary, reflecting the rapid pace of genetic research and its coverage in the media. Written Definitions: Each glossary entry has a written definition that has been reviewed for clarity and accuracy by teams of science educators and genetic researchers. All of the definitions were written by the same Ph.D.-level science writer for consistency and accuracy. Illustrations: Most terms have professionally drawn illustrations to further explain a meaning or concept, or place them in context of the cell or a similar biological setting as a means to better explain the term. All illustrations are provided by the medical illustrator/artist at the NHGRI to enable continuity and maximize re-use in learning tools such as slide shows. All illustrations are copyright free. Each illustration can be viewed as a webpage within the glossary or downloaded as a high-quality PDF file or PowerPoint slide. 3‚ÄìD Animations: The Glossary contains many terms that are illustrated with 3-D movie animations. The animations have a non-descript musical background and are purposely not narrated to maximize use. These animations may be played alone or simultaneously with the spoken definition of the term. All cellular organelles have animation sequences, as do many key terms such as gene, cell, ACGT, and chromosome. Spoken Explanations of Glossary Terms: Each term features a friendly and informative spoken explanation that can be heard on any computer with sound capabilities by clicking on the \\"Listen\\" button on each term page. Spoken explanations can be paused at any point for user convenience. Each speaker comments on, or defines, terms relevant to their personal field of study. For example, leading cancer researchers comment on cancer, genetic counselors explain genetic testing terms, and expert gene hunters tackle the many terms surrounding the search for or mapping of genes. All speakers are actively working in the field, and most work at NHGRI. The written definition provides a reasonable definition for each term. The spoken definition is not the same as the written definition. Instead, each speaker was asked to provide information different than the written definition that would expand the listener‚Äôs understanding of the term. Speakers were also asked to explain the term to the average person, not another scientist. No speaker was allowed to read, all recorded explanations are spontaneous. How to Pronounce a Term: Much of the terminology of genetics and biology is unique in its pronunciation. Below each term name is a ‚ÄúPronunciation‚Äù button. Click the button to hear the term spoken. Each term, regardless of its name, is pronounced. Information On Each Speaker: A brief biography and photograph of each speaker accompanies terms listed in the glossary. This enables the user to examine the speaker's credentials and learn more about their research interests. Related Terms: If either a written or spoken definition uses other Talking Glossary terms in its text or dialogue, these terms appear in the ‚ÄúRelated Terms‚Äù listing at the bottom of each term page. The related terms list also includes Glossary terms that reviewers of the Glossary felt would be helpful to the user. ‚ÄúTest Your Gene Knowledge‚Äù Quiz: The Talking Glossary offers a 10-term quiz designed to be both fun and instructional. The quiz can be accessed from every term page in the Glossary. Users can choose to test their knowledge about terms commonly found in K-16 science classrooms or, more generally, in popular news reports or conversation. The quiz randomly chooses terms from the Talking Glossary and asks the user to select a term name to match the definition shown. Hints are available for each question, and at the end of the quiz all users are able to print a \\"Certificate of Completion\\" that includes the date the test was taken, number of correct answers, and the user's name. About PDF and PPT Files: PDF (Portable Document Format) files are high-quality image files that appear and print like the original artwork. These finely detailed illustrations will download quickly and include required fonts. PDF files of Glossary illustrations can be downloaded and saved for later uses, such as overhead transparencies, school reports, or for handouts in class or at a talk or other event. Each PDF file is formatted to print on regular printer paper or standard overhead transparency. Illustrations are also downloadable as PowerPoint slides. These files can be easily copied and pasted into any existing PowerPoint presentation or can serve as a starting point for a new presentation. These slides are designed to provide lecturers with an easy-to- use and convenient source of illustrations for genetic terms and concepts.

The Canadian Afghan detainee issue concerns Government of Canada or the Canadian Forces (CF) knowledge of abusive treatment of detainees in Afghanistan. The abuse occurred after Afghans were detained by Canadian Forces, and subsequently transferred to the Afghan National Army (ANA) or the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS) during the War in Afghanistan. The issue has sparked heated debate since Article 12 of the Third Geneva Convention (of which Canada is a signatory) states that \\"the Detaining Power [Canada] is responsible for the treatment given [to prisoners of war]\\". If the allegations of torture are true it would mean Canada is guilty of war crimes. The allegations were first sparked by University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran, who claimed that full versions of government documents proved Canada had willful knowledge that torture would occur before handing detainees to Afghan authorities. Subsequent to this, two official complaints have led to official investigations and hearings by the Military Police Complaints Commission (MPCC). One of these unveiled parliamentary testimony by diplomat Richard Colvin, who claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, and it was a standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators. The allegations have led to a showdown in the House of Commons of Canada, as opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) had called for the releasing of relevant documents in full and unredacted form, claiming parliamentary privilege to see them. The government maintained that they had a duty to protect Canadian soldiers and citizens as the documents contained sensitive information. At the request of the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, a panel of former justices and selected MPs was tasked with sorting through the documents, and determining the need to release or withhold them. To date, only about 4,000 out of the estimated 40,000 documents have been released, A final report released in June 2012 found no wrongdoing by Canadian Forces members, but did issue recommendations related to improving military policing and MPCC access to information and witnesses. The Canadian public generally held views that there was knowledge of detainee abuse by military or government officials. The issue has also led to scrutiny on detainee treatment by other Canadian departments and the armed forces of other nations. Background Canada's military involvement in Afghanistan began in 2002 with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a coalition of soldiers from 42 countries, which was tasked as a counterinsurgency effort in response to the 11 September attacks. ISAF had initially been established as a stabilization force by the United Nations Security Council on 20 December 2001, to secure Kabul. The Canadian Liberal government at the time, under Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, chose to have the Canadian Forces (CF) hand over its prisoners to the United States, who led the fight against al-Qaeda and other insurgents. After NATO took command of Afghanistan in 2003, Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse at the hands of the United States armed forces in Iraq came to the attention of the public, and Canada soon faced pressure to hand their prisoners to someone else. Canada entered into an agreement with the Afghan government and started transferring detainees to Afghan security forces, which comprised the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS). On 18 December 2005, then-Chief of Defence Staff Rick Hillier signed an agreement between Canada's Department of National Defence and the Government of Afghanistan. The agreement did not include any explicit right of access by Canada to Afghan detainees. Members of the opposition requested then-Minister of National Defence Gordon O'Connor to renegotiate the prisoner transfer agreement. This request was dismissed, with O'Connor saying the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent fulfilled the duty of ensuring fair treatment of detainees and Canada could be notified and take action in any cases of abuse. However, the Red Cross stated that their mandate was being misunderstood, and it was the responsibility of Canada. It maintained that it had no role in monitoring the Canada-Afghanistan detainee-transfer agreement, and that following long-established operating procedure, the Red Cross would not reveal to any foreign government any abuses it might find in Afghan prisons. While maintaining that detainee monitoring was the Red Cross' duty until March 2007, O'Connor apologized to the House of Commons for previously misleading them on the issue. In turn, a new agreement was reached in April 2007 that allowed Canadian officials to have access to Kandahar jails. History=Initial allegations The first allegations of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents he had received through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners in the custody of Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture on the part of the interrogator and should be investigated. Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation. In April 2007, The Globe and Mail published interviews with 30 men who claimed they were \\"beaten, starved, frozen and choked after they were handed over to Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security\\" by CF members. It also revealed that it had received a censored report by the Canadian government on human rights in Afghanistan through an access to information request, and it contained \\"negative references to acts such as torture, abuse, and extra judicial killings [that] were blacked out without an explanation\\". This prompted intensive questioning in the House, to which O'Connor claimed that a new agreement had been reached, saying \\"we have, in the last few days, entered into a local agreement in the Kandahar province to enter the detention facilities any time we want\\". This would be reaffirmed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, stating that there was \\"no evidence that access is blocked to the prisons\\", and that Afghan authorities had agreed to \\"formalize that agreement so there is no potential misunderstanding\\". Regardless, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer announced that the Afghan government was to launch an inquiry about the fate of detainees. In January 2008, it was revealed that the government ceased the detainee transfers after an internal investigation revealed allegations of a detainee being abused on 5 November 2007. Richard Colvin testimony Allegations regarding the treatment of Afghan detainees resurfaced in November 2009 via parliamentary testimony by Richard Colvin, the second highest-ranked member of Canada's diplomatic service in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2007. Colvin claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, and it was a standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators. This would be consistent with special reports by the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the US Department of State. Colvin also said the torture involved beatings, whipping with power cables, the use of electricity, knives, open flames and rape. The Canadian government dismissed opposition calls for a public inquiry the next day. \\"There has not been a single, solitary proven allegation of abuse involving a transferred Taliban prisoner by Canadian forces\\", Defence Minister Peter MacKay said in the House of Commons, with his parliamentary secretary suggesting Colvin was not credible. Regardless, Colvin would provide further testimony in a hearing at the MPCC. He stated that upon visiting Kandahar province's main prison in May 2006, he discovered the ICRC had a \\"serious problem\\" with trying to keep track of Afghan prisoners. Officials had approached Colvin with \\"forceful\\" concerns about the lack of information given to them by Canada, causing them to lose \\"many, if not most ‚Äì and possibly all ‚Äì of our detainees\\", stated Colvin. He has also presented allegations that Canadian government and military officials knew about reports of abuse and human rights violations surrounding former governor of Kandahar Asadullah Khalid, saying Canadian officials heard credible sources claiming that Khalid ran a drug network, used drugs himself, used private detention facilities, and sexually abused young girls. Colvin is not the only civil servant to indicate there was a problem about Afghan detainees. Eileen Olexiuk, another Canadian diplomat in Afghanistan, also revealed in an interview with the CBC that she had warned the government in 2005 about torture problems. She said that the government, which was under the leadership of Paul Martin at the time, ignored her advice. Subsequent allegations On 8 December 2009, General Walter Natynczyk testified before a parliamentary committee that one particular detainee that was abused on 14 June 2006 by Afghan police was never in CF custody. Canada's chief commander stated that although CF members had questioned the man, he was taken into custody by Afghan police, and Canadian troops rescued him when the police started beating him with their shoes. However, the general corrected himself the following day upon receiving new information that the man had in fact been in Canadian custody. This would be the first piece of evidence that Afghan detainees in Canadian custody were subsequently abused by Afghan officials, contrary to government claims that there was no such evidence. It prompted opposition MPs to recall for a public inquiry into the matter, and for Peter MacKay to be fired. Canada's top military commander subsequently ordered an inquiry to find out why he had not been informed about this incident. This inquiry revealed many Canadian soldiers were aware that Afghan security forces beat prisoners \\"in the street and elsewhere\\" on a regular basis. A separate report to General Natynczyk also concluded that the detainee beaten in June 2006 was not defined as a Canadian detainee, preventing it from being reported up the chain of command, and that the CF and Department of Defence should \\"be tasked to examine the detainee reporting process ... to develop one consolidated process for the reporting on [Canadian Forces] detainees\\". The United Nations (UN) has released at least two reports implicating torture in Afghanistan. A report from April 2010 stated the \\"use of harsh interrogation techniques and forced confession of guilt by the Afghan National Police and the National Directorate of Security was documented, including the use of electric shocks and beating\\", against juvenile detainees suspected of being involved in insurgency. This became concerning after a briefing note to Peter MacKay stated that many juvenile detainees were arrested by the CF, and transferred to the NDS, as per CF policy for all detainees under the age of 18. It also stated juvenile detainees were being kept in a Canadian transfer facility in Kandahar for \\"a significant period\\". Another report by the UN was released in October 2011. Interviews with 379 detainees at 47 facilities over the period of a year found \\"a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill-treatment\\" at multiple facilities operated by the ANP and NDS, after 46% of the detainees it spoke with indicated it occurred. A written statement by the Afghan government denied the 'systematic' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated, although it admitted to deficiencies due to a lack of training and resources. The report also suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment, with one case citing a man who stated everyone was treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians. Investigations and inquiries While the first specific allegations of abuse surfaced more than three years ago, there has been no official public inquiry. MPs in the House of Commons voted 146 to 129 in favour of a motion to set one up, but the Prime Minister has refused to consider it, stating that \\"the government of Canada has taken all necessary actions in all instances where there is proof of abuse of Afghan prisoners\\". Some critics and the Speaker of the House of Commons have also scolded both the government and opposition MPs for using the issue for political gain. Opposition MPs have stated that it should not be left to the military to investigate itself through the MPCC. To date, there have been two main investigations conducted by the MPCC in relation to Afghan detainees. The first was launched on 9 February 2007 after a formal complaint by Amir Attaran regarding the treatment of three specific detainees arrested in Kandahar region in April 2006. The findings from this investigation stated that CF members handled the detainees appropriately, and were given medical treatment. However, the MPCC also found that the CF failed to conduct an investigation into how one of the detainees became injured, contrary to normal direction. The second investigation was launched on 26 February 2007, following a joint complaint between Amnesty International Canada and the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, alleging CF military police transferred detainees while there was enough evidence to suggest they would be tortured on at least 18 occasions. The investigation was moved to a public hearing process on 12 March 2008, mainly due to \\"delays and difficulties in obtaining relevant documents and information from government authorities\\". This triggered legal challenges from the federal government over the MPCC's jurisdiction to investigate such complaints, resulting in a ruling that the MPCC had no jurisdiction over \\"transfer complaints\\", but it did over \\"failure to investigate\\" complaints. During substantial testimony and hearings throughout 2010, the government engaged the MPCC another three times for judicial review of the MPCC findings, including the testimony of Richard Colvin. A judge dismissed these challenges in September 2011. The MPCC released its report on 27 June 2012. No wrongdoing was found against specific Canadian Forces members, but the report \\"identified serious problems regarding reporting, accountability and information sharing\\". Four recommendations were made in the report to specifically improve the work of Canadian Forces Military Police that are deployed on missions, as well as improving document disclosure and witness access during MPCC hearings. Dispute over documents and parliamentary committees=Beginning of calls and prorogation Opposition MPs in the House of Commons began calling for all documents the government possessed regarding the detainee issue to be made public since Richard Colvin's testimony in November 2009. Minister of Foreign Affairs Lawrence Cannon assured the House of Commons that the documents would be handed over to a special committee in charge of looking into the issue. \\"There's a mandatory obligation on public officials to ensure that when information is released that it is in compliance with the Canada Evidence Act [to avoid security risks]\\", according to Minister of Defence Peter MacKay. However, opposition MPs and other critics stated that this was an absurd argument, as Parliament has the constitutional right to have access to the documents uncensored. On 10 December 2009, the House of Commons passed a motion requiring the release of unredacted documents concerning the Afghan detainees to the committee hearing the issue. However, the government refused to abide by the motion. Critics repeated that the government was violating the Constitution of Canada and will be in contempt of Parliament if it continued to refuse to release uncensored documents regarding the Afghan detainee issue. A select group of MPs and an independent panel of 3 jurists are responsible for determining what documents are relevant to allegations of detainee abuse, and how to release them to the public. On 30 December 2009, the parliamentary session was put on hold by being prorogued at the request of the Prime Minister. According to his spokesman, he sought this prorogation to consult with Canadians about the economy. The move caused cries from opposition MPs who labelled it as an attempt to \\"muzzle parliamentarians amid controversy over the Afghan detainees affair\\". Prorogation prevented the parliamentary committee from continuing to probe the issue. Although informal committee meetings continued, they had no power to compel testimony or grant immunity, and Conservative MPs would not be represented. Parliament resumes and 2010 release Justice Minister Rob Nicholson announced to the House of Commons on 5 March 2010 that former Supreme Court of Canada judge Frank Iacobucci was appointed to advise Nicholson if any \\"injurious\\" effects would result from making the Afghan detainee documents public. However, University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran pointed out that Iacobucci was not a sitting judge and therefore had no power except to give lawyer advice to Nicholson. The opposition expressed deep disappointment with the decision, saying that they did not doubt the competence of the former justice, but believed that it was nothing more than another way to delay the issue. While parliamentarians were not given the Terms of Reference posed to Iacobucci immediately, they were released on 13 March 2010. The government finally released thousands of documents to MPs at the end of March 2010. The documents immediately drew fierce criticism by the opposition, because they were still heavily redacted, and the \\"totally incoherent and totally disorderly\\" fashion of handing them out in a single copy and only in English (instead of both of Canada's official languages). The government maintained that redactions are required to protect Canada, with Justice Minister Rob Nicholson stating they were done by \\"non- partisan public servants whose only interest is the protection of national security\\". Speaker's question and ruling On 18 March, the three opposition parties united in a bid to force the government to let them look at uncensored documents on the Afghan detainees affair or face parliamentary contempt proceedings. Specifically, they called on the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, Peter Milliken to rule that the government violated collective parliamentary privilege #5 in refusing to hand over uncensored documents on the transfer of Afghan detainees. MPs have claimed that the request from Parliament was based on \\"340 years of bedrock constitutional history\\", and that there are systems in place to decide what is and is not appropriate to release to the public. Referring to those \\"systems\\", Reg Whitaker noted that members of the \\"Military Police Complaints Commission, whose investigation of the Afghan detainee issue actually led to the calling of the parliamentary inquiry ... are [already] fully security cleared [to see the unredacted documents]\\". The Speaker first asked for comments from government and opposition MPs on the matter, including Peter MacKay, Rob Nicholson, Derek Lee, Jack Harris, Tom Lukiwski, and Jim Abbott. After considering the matter for two weeks, the Speaker ruled on 27 April 2010 that Parliament had a right to ask for uncensored documents. He asked that all House leaders, ministers and MPs to come to a collective solution \\"without compromising the security and confidentiality contained\\". The Speaker gave the House until 11 May 2010 to find a common ground. While MPs within the negotiations had to ask The Speaker for an extension of the deadline, it was granted until 14 May, and a deal was reached that morning. A Memorandum of Understanding on the particulars was not established until 16 June, when it was actually tabled in the House of Commons. It was still not agreed to by all political parties: The New Democratic Party refused to endorse the deal. Panel work and 2011 release A panel of MPs began the task of going through over 40,000 documents related to Afghan detainees on 10 July 2010. The MPs, consisting of one member and one alternate from the Liberal, Conservative and Bloc parties, determines what is relevant to the allegations of abuse. An independent panel of jurists determines how documents will be released publicly, in some cases censoring documents that may threaten national security, international relations, or soldiers in Afghanistan. This panel consists of Frank Iacobucci, fellow former Supreme Court justice Claire L'Heureux-Dub√© and former B.C. Supreme Court judge Donald Brenner. Any documents that the government claims to contain legal advice may force the panel to determine whether to allow the MPs to see them. Approximately 4,000 documents were released by the government on 22 June 2011, almost a year after the panel began its work. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird stated that the process had come to an end, \\"and accusations of improper conduct are unfounded\\". However, there are an estimated 36,000 pages still remaining that have not been released in a less-redacted form. Based on the documents that were released, MP St√©phane Dion implied that they were cause for concern, and \\"The likelihood is very high\\" that a detainee was abused while in the custody of Afghan authorities. \\"I don't think Canadians will accept that it's over\\", he added. Related abuse allegations=Canada In March 2010, The Canadian Press reported that documents filed with the MPCC showed that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had started playing a role in the interrogation of Afghans captured by the CF. Sources say the military's decision to hand captives over to the NDS was sometimes based on the recommendations of CSIS interrogators, but Canadian military officials always delivered the final decision. This prompted CSIS to undertake a review of its dealings with Afghan detainees \\"to ensure that the Service can ... account for its engagement during this period\\". Briefing notes to CSIS director Dick Fadden state that the service interrogated up to 50 prisoners (between 2002 through late 2007 according to an assistant director with the service), but insists that they were treated properly. The notes also state \\"CSIS officers have been serving alongside the Canadian Forces\\" while armed, and affirms that agents had no role in determining whether prisoners should be transferred to Afghan authorities. It is believed that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named Sand Trap, examined allegations that a JTF2 member was involved in the 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid at the conclusion of the investigation. However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. This investigation is still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led to calls for civilian oversight of JTF2. International The High Court of Justice declared on 25 June 2010 that there was \\"a possibility of torture and serious mistreatment\\" of prisoners transferred by British soldiers to Afghan authorities. There are also allegations that the NDS tortured detainees handed over to them by British soldiers in Afghanistan. Allegations were also made that British Armed Forces have received evidence of this torture, and NATO \\"has buried its head in the sand while torture has continued, and it's known about it\\". The British High Court of Justice ruled on 25 June 2010 that there was \\"a possibility of torture and serious mistreatment\\" of prisoners. It is now illegal for British troops to hand over detainees to the NDS in Kabul, however The High Court still approved of transfers in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. This was on the condition that government and military officials improved its systems for monitoring detainees to avoid \\"a real risk of torture or serious mistreatment\\". On 6 September 2011, it was revealed that NATO had suspended transfers of detainees to several Afghan prisons. The move was prompted by a United Nations report, published a few days later, which described \\"a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill-treatment\\" at a number of facilities run by the NDS and Afghan police. NATO stated it would undertake verification on the claims, and be \\"prudent\\" in halting transfers until that time. Public opinion An EKOS poll conducted in December 2009 revealed that 83% of the respondents believed the government knew Afghan detainees were tortured. This was a consistent result across all age groups, genders and geographic locations. It also concluded that 41% of respondents were dissatisfied with the governments transparency on the issue, and only 24% were satisfied. The remaining 35% were still undecided or had no opinion. As time progressed, 61% of Canadians still believed Afghan detainees were tortured in May 2010, according to an Ipsos-Reid poll. This poll also found that 52% of respondents believed that Stephen Harper and Canadian soldiers knew torture was occurring, and 75% believed senior military officials would have known about the problem. A poll done by Angus Reid during 5 January and 6, found that 38 per cent of Canadians believed that Harper used 30 December 2009 prorogation to curtail the Canadian Afghan detainee issue.

Decommissioned 2 October 1946, Patroclus was berthed at Green Cove Springs, Florida, as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until November 1951. Then, transferred to the custody of the 6th Naval District, she underwent conversion prior to transfer under the Military Assistance Program. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register 22 August 1952, she was transferred to Turkey, on 15 November 1952, where she served that nation as TCG Basaran (A 582). She was scrapped in September 1993.

It literally means \\"Han poetry\\". Kanshi was the most popular form of poetry during the early Heian period in Japan among Japanese aristocrats and proliferated until the modern period. History The earliest collection of kanshi was the Kaif≈´s≈ç, compiled in 751. The Kaif≈´s≈ç was also one of the earliest works of Japanese literature, and according to Judith Rabinovitch and Timothy Bradstock, it was a collection of occasional verse spanning from 672-751.Judith N Rabinovitch and Timothy Roland Bradstock (2005) Dance of the butterflies : Chinese poetry from the Japanese court tradition. Ithaca, NY : East Asia Program, Cornell University. The compiler of the Kaif≈´s≈ç may have been Omi no Mifune, Isonokami no Yakatsugu, or Prince Shirakabe and Fujiwara no Satsuo. Three imperial collections of kanshi were compiled during the 9th century: the Ry≈çunsh≈´ of 814, the Bunka Sh≈´reish≈´ of 818, and the Keikokush≈´ of 827. Indeed, kanshi was accorded a higher place than the native waka form until the Kokin Wakash≈´ collection was published in 905. Even before the early Heian period, the word shi (Ë©©) meaning \\"poetry\\" was automatically understood to refer to kanshi, while the character Ê≠å (ka/uta) of waka ÂíåÊ≠å referred to Japanese poetry proper. The Shi Jing, great Chinese poets of the Six Dynasties and Tang dynasty, such as Bai Juyi and others influenced the Japanese kanshi poets of the time, and when the Japanese met foreign diplomats of the time, they communicated in Chinese writing. Some went to China for study or diplomatic relations, and learned under Chinese poets such as Li Bai and Du Fu. Important kanshi poets of the Heian period included K≈´kai, who learned to speak Chinese fluently during his time studying in China, Sugawara no Michizane, who did not study in China, but had a good understanding of Chinese, and Shimada no Tadaomi, among many others. Emperor Saga was a notable kanshi poet, who even ordered the compilation of 3 anthologies of kanshi, the first three imperial anthologies. Also noteworthy are private collections of Chinese poetry. One such collection combined both kanshi and waka: cf. the Wakan r≈çeish≈´. Kanshi composition is not limited to Medieval Japan. During the Edo period and the early Meiji period many or 'men of letters' schooled in the philosophy of Neo-Confucianism composed kanshi. Despite the fascination of the Japanese with the European literature in the early 20th century, many of the \\"new literary giants\\" of the time, (e.g. Natsume S≈çsekiYiu, Angela. Chaos and Order in the Works of Natsume S≈çseki. University of Hawaii Press, 1998. p182ff.) composed kanshi. Gen. Maresuke Nogi was a noted poet of kanshi poems. During World War II, Japanese militarist propaganda encouraged study and composition of kanshi because it was considered to boost the \\"martial spirit\\". After 1945, study of kanshi steadily declined as the school system was changed by the American Occupation policies. Nowadays, kanshi is usually studied in the upper-level kanbun classes in high schools, albeit only in passing. Shigin hobbyists maintain the chanting tradition, but they are few and far between. Forms Kanshi had multiple forms, but most notable were in 5 or 7 syllables in 4 or 8 lines. The Japanese poets of kanshi were skilled in the strict rhyming rules of l√ºshi ÂæãË©© and jueju ÁµïÂè•, the two forms of the regulated verse that had gained most popularity during the Tang dynasty in China.

Hadow led the multi-award-winning ¬£6.5m international research programme, Catlin Arctic Survey (2007-2012) which investigated sea ice volume, ocean acidification and ocean circulation. A number of papers have since been published in scientific journals by the researchers. He accepted a World Technology Network Award (Environment) on behalf of the Catlin Arctic Survey team in New York (2009); and along with Ann Daniels and Martin Hartley (expedition team members on the 2009 survey), he was declared a ‚ÄòHero of the Environment‚Äô by TIME magazine for his team's work. In summer 2017, he led Arctic Mission, which became the first boat expedition without icebreakers to sail into the ice-free international waters surrounding the North Geographic Pole. Its pioneering research into the wildlife, ecosystem, and marine pollution of these waters was led in the field by Tim Gordon (University of Exeter, UK).

Though reported at the time by the school's headmaster as having last been run in 1927, the school commissioned research in 2014 which found that Hadow was the first recorded person ever to have run the full distance. The running of Long Ducker has since become one of the school's major annual events involving pupils, teachers, support staff and parents and can raise in excess of ¬£100,000 for charity each year. He attended University College London where he was awarded the Professor Bill Mead Scholarship, and graduated with a BA (Hons) in Geography in 1984. Life and career Hadow worked at Mark McCormack's Sports Organisation from 1985 to 1988, acting as an agent representing the European equestrian interests of International Management Group (IMG). He managed IMG's relationship with the Swedish Equestrian Federation to deliver the funds, through corporate sponsorship, to underwrite the staging costs of the inaugural World Equestrian Games in Stockholm (1990). The Games brought together the world championship events of the six disciplines under the jurisdiction of the International Equestrian Federation (FEI): dressage; eventing; vaulting; carriage driving; endurance; and show jumping. In 1995 he set up The Polar Travel Company offering guided expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic, and most notably the North Geographic Pole. In 1997 he organised the McVitie's Penguin Polar Relay, the first all-women expedition to the North Geographic Pole, involving 20 British women, operating in five teams of four, accompanied throughout by two professional women Canadian guides. Hadow is an Honorary Vice-President of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, an Honorary Vice-President of the Scientific Exploration Society, an Honorary Patron of British Exploring, and President of the OH Adventurers. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Exeter (2004), and an Honorary Doctorate of Science from the University of Plymouth (2009). North Pole - Solo, unsupported In 2003, Hadow trekked 770 km from Ward Hunt Island, Canada to the North Geographic Pole in 64 days becoming the first person to complete the journey solo and without resupply. He started the trek on 17 March 2003, pulling a 265 lb sledge and arrived 19 May. Of the 850 hours travelling across the disintegrating sea ice, he swam part of the way wearing an immersion suit when he encountered open water or thin ice. His book 'Solo: Alone & Unsupported to the North Pole' (published by Michael Joseph) recounts the journey. South Pole In 2004, Hadow partnered with Simon Murray for a trek to the South Geographic Pole. The 1,200 km trek started 5 December 2003, on Antarctica's Zumberge Coast, approximately 120 km to the east of the traditional Hercules Inlet start point, and was completed on reaching the South Pole on 28 January 2004. Murray (63) became the oldest person to reach the South Pole from the continental coastline;\\"Desert Island Discs\\" 01.04.2009 BBC Radio 4 and the expedition raised US$450,000 for the Royal Geographical Society (London)  Catlin Arctic Surveys In 2009, Hadow organised and led an exploration team to survey the thickness of the winter-spring sea ice in the northern Beaufort Sea area (Arctic Ocean). Its purpose was to provide a new source of information from the ocean's surface to help forecast how long the perennial sea-ice cover would continue to be a year-round surface feature of the planet.Home ‚Äì Arctic Survey The expedition, known as the \\"Catlin Arctic Survey\\" after lead sponsor Catlin Group Limited, an international speciality insurance and reinsurance company, covered 430 km in 73 days, with Hadow accompanied by Arctic explorer, Ann Daniels, and photographer Martin Hartley.Catlin Group Limited was a Bermuda-based specialty insurance and reinsurance company. Catlin operated six underwriting hubs worldwide and operated more than 55 offices worldwide. It owned the largest syndicate at Lloyd's of London, based on 2011 gross written premiums.[2] Catlin shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by XL Group plc in May 2015. The Survey's observations, viewed in the context of decades of existing measurements by submarines, satellites and buoys, led Professor Peter Wadhams of the Polar Ocean Physics Group (University of Cambridge) to suggest the Survey's work added further evidence to an emerging view that there is a significant probability that by 2020 only 20% of the Arctic Ocean basin will have sea ice cover in the late summer. Professor Wadhams also suggested that by 2030‚Äì40, there is a significant probability that the Arctic Ocean's sea ice cover will be transformed into an ice-free open ocean in summer times. Catlin Group Limited continued its support of the Arctic Survey in 2010,http://www.catlin.com/cgl/media/press_releases/pr_2010/2010-02-25/ with a scientific focus on ocean acidification http://www.catlinarcticsurvey2010.com/ and in 2011 http://www.catlin.com/cgl/media/press_releases/pr_2011/2011-01-26qa/ on ocean thermo-haline circulation.http://www.catlinarcticsurvey.com/ In 2010 and 2011 the Surveys, delivered by newly formed Geo Mission Ltd, involved two inter- linked field research components: a seasonal (winter/spring) research base located on the sea ice of the Gustav Adolph Sea on the edge of the Arctic Ocean (off Ellef Ringnes island) amongst Canada's northernmost Queen Elizabeth islands, and a 300 ‚Äì 450 km transect of the Arctic Ocean surveyed by a team of explorers in the Winter / Spring. Scientific papers have since been published by the participating research groups. Hadow, Chip Cunliffe and Martin Hartley co-edited the book, 'Catlin Arctic Survey: Investigating the Changing Arctic Ocean Environment', published by Polarworld (2013).

Murray Abraham and Eric Roberts as world-class fencers. Directed by Jeremy Paul Kagan, this is the first feature film about fencing. Although some reviews of its 1993 U.S. theatrical release noted favorably the lead acting and action sequences, the screenplay was considered \\"terrible\\". Plot Alexander Villard is a former fencing champion who runs a highly competitive fencing school. One of his students describes him as \\"a freak who thinks he's living in the fourteenth century\\". Max Suba is an ex-convict who introduces himself as a fencing instructor. Villard initially gives him a job as a janitor. With time, Suba recovers his lost form and shows that he can fence. Villard has Suba spar with an ambitious student to demonstrate a point. Villard is \\"arrogant but not unkind\\", and eventually gives Suba a chance to teach, assigning him the beginning students. While Villard takes a ruthless approach, encouraging a student to injure an opponent to win, Suba takes a subtler approach, encouraging students to turn their own weaknesses into strengths. Following this advice, one of Suba's beginning level students scores against Villard's prize fencer during an in-school competition. Flashbacks further develop the conflict by revealing how Suba had killed Villard's father in a fencing duel. The film climaxes in a dramatic duel between Villard and Suba. Cast and crew The film's featured stars are Abraham and Roberts as Suba and Villard respectively. Abraham had won an Oscar for his work in Amadeus in 1984, and Roberts had been nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1985. The film also credits Mia Sara as Erin Clavelli and Christopher Rydell as Jim Trebor, both students at the fencing school. Mia Sara is best known for her role as Ferris Bueller's girlfriend in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Elaine Kagan plays Rachel, Suba's romantic interest. Brett Cullen, who has appeared in Lost and The West Wing, plays fencing instructor Danny Gallagher. Other students are played by Doug Wert and Stephen Polk. In her second film appearance, Eve Kagan plays Gallagher's daughter. (Her first appearance had been in 1989, in a film also directed by Kagan.) Bill Conti composed the score. Conti had won a 1983 Oscar for the score to The Right Stuff, and is famous for the themes for the movie Rocky and For Your Eyes Only. The score was performed and recorded by classical Guitarist Angel Romero. Jeremy Kagan was a prolific television director. For his work with the Chicago Hope episode Leave of Absence, he won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series in 1996. Release By the Sword was shown at the Vancouver International Film Festival in October 1991. It subsequently appeared at the American Film Market in Santa Monica in late October of the same year, and at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January 1992. It was released in France under the title \\"Par l'√©p√©e\\" on October 7, 1992. In the US, the film opened in Chicago on May 14, 1993; in Los Angeles on September 24, 1993; and in New York City on October 22, 1993. According to Box Office Mojo, in its September run the film was shown in nine theaters and grossed $6,220. The film's cinematic poster was created by John Alvin, who was known for his work on the posters for Blazing Saddles and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, among others. The film was released on VHS in 1994 as a Columbia TriStar home video. Reception The film has received nearly opposite reviews. Roger Ebert says \\"the movie adds some supporting characters in order to show us things about fencing that we didn't know\\", but another reviewer finds the minor characters \\"unnecessary\\" and \\"thinly drawn\\", so \\"the film suffers whenever the plot focuses on them\\". Although Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum says the film \\"suffers from overdone, mannerist performances by the two leads\\", another reviewer says \\"the key to this film resides in the performances by Eric Roberts and F. Murray Abraham\\". The film develops Suba's character in particular, revealing a past that \\"he seems unable to completely let go of.\\" Ebert says of the lead actors: \\"they create characters much more interesting and dimensional than this thin screenplay really requires.\\" The most consistent point noted in review is poor screenplay and directing. New York Times critic Vincent Canby calls the screenplay \\"nonsense\\", saying bluntly: \\"the screenplay is terrible, full of unfinished subplots and lines that appear to announce its essential aimlessness.\\" Regarding one of the more important subplots, a critic wrote: \\"Sadly, Kagan a routine television and film director adds nothing to the intriguing notion of a man who's spent half his life in prison returning to the scene of his crime.\\" Although one critic calls the many flashbacks \\"a further directorial flourish\\", they are still at best an \\"interesting idea that isn't really successfully pulled off.\\" While the action sequences are \\"well handled\\", Canby says \\"the drama is fraught with anticlimax.\\" Overall, the plot is full of \\"sports clich√©s\\", could \\"as well have been about croquet\\", and is \\"a little too neat and obvious to really carry the material.\\" One review says: \\"Right down to the painful fencing-to-disco-music routine, this is embarrassingly fab.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * Internet Movie Poster Awards.com * Reel.com Category:1991 films Category:1990s action drama films Category:1990s sports films Category:American films Category:American action drama films Category:American sports films Category:English-language films Category:French films Category:French action drama films Category:French sports films Category:Films scored by Bill Conti Category:Films directed by Jeremy Kagan Category:Fencing films Category:Swashbuckler films Category:American films about revenge Category:1991 drama films Category:1992 drama films Category:1992 films ","title":"By the Sword (film)"},{"id":"10925966","text":"Guy Lafitte (12 January 1927 ‚Äì 11 July 1998) was a French jazz saxophonist.

Palms Australia's national office is based in Sydney, although state coordinators are located throughout Australia. Established in 1961, Palms Australia has placed volunteers with communities and organisations in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, South America and in Indigenous communities in Australia. Palms Australia supports community development by sending volunteers at the request of the receiving communities. Volunteers work alongside local people and receive an equivalent living wage. History Palms Australia started in Sydney in 1956 as the Paulian Association. Groups formed in around 100 communities to identify local social justice issues, reflect on values and take appropriate action to address social inequality and assist people in need. After identifying that similar issues needed to be addressed globally, in 1961, the program was extended to communities overseas that request the placement of skilled volunteers to help develop health, education and other facilities. Since 1961, Palms Australia has placed over 1500 volunteers in 39 countries around the world. The Fair Trade Coffee Company In 2006, Palms Australia established The Fair Trade Coffee Company, a not-for-profit, community cafe in Glebe, NSW. All proceeds from the cafe went towards funding Palms Australia's work in their partner communities. In 2008, The Fair Trade Coffee Company won the 'Best Coffee in Sydney' award from the independent media group. In May 2009, the caf√© celebrated World Fair Trade Day with dances and drum beats from community drummers and dancers from across Sydney. The event made Sydney one of 10 global cities marking the theme of the day, to 'Make a Big Bang to Beat Poverty'. The event attracted over 700 people within 1¬Ω hours.

Hamburg was one of three towns, along with nearby Howell and Toonerville, that were evacuated in 1940‚Äì1941 when the area was taken over by the U.S. Department of the Army for the Weldon Spring Ordnance Works, which manufactured trinitrotoluene (TNT) and dinitrotoluene (DNT) and later processed uranium. History Settled in the 1830s by German immigrants John Nahm, William Koenig, George Mades, Daniel Schmidt, Jacob Schneider and Nickolas Roth, Hamburg was a railroad and river access point and town-center for farm families of the area. The town met its demise in 1941 when the U.S. government purchased the entire area including two other nearby farm communities (Howell and Toonerville) for construction of an ordinance plant to support preparations for World War II. The federal government notified residents in late 1940 of its plan for the plant and by mid-1941 everyone was moved out and the area closed off. Some had negotiated purchase prices and received their payment but others ended up in a long court battle that was not settled until after WWII in the U.S. Supreme Court. Hamburg (not to be confused with New Hamburg in southeast Missouri) was located along the Missouri River, southwest of St. Charles along Highway 94 in St. Charles County. Nearby farm communities were settled in late 18th century by the Howell and Boone (Daniel Boone and son Daniel Morgan Boone) families. Originally the German settlers of the to-be Hamburg built homes near the Missouri River below and along the bluff, but after flooding the majority of the community moved above the bluff overlooking the river, creating an upper and lower Hamburg. A few people in the area had participated in the California gold rush and returned to Missouri with enough money to buy farms and start their families. Many served in the Civil War, some on either side, though for the most part German-heritage families supported the Union. A number of settlers moved to the Oklahoma territory during the Land Run of 1889. Notable residents John E. Schneider, a coverlet weaver, one of the first west of the Mississippi River with coverlets now both in the Saint Louis Art Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago, was born in 1823 and an early respected citizen of Hamburg. Registration and search on \\"John Schneider\\" may be necessary. Archie Bowman, locally remembered as one of the last U.S. citizens to die in World War I, lived in Hamburg. Ralph Sutton, a well-known traditional jazz stride pianist, was born in Hamburg in 1922. In the early years of his career during the 1930s, he performed in his father's band at the Riverview Park dance hall in Hamburg. The dance hall was specifically built by his father Earl Sutton and Earl's business partner and friend Theodore (Tot) Mades to encourage Ralph's playing.

Taxonomy The protea canary was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the protea canary were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra. Description The protea canary is 15‚Äì16 cm in length with a large pale bill. The adult has grey-brown upperparts, a black chin, white throat and two thin buff wing bars. The underparts are buff with light streaking. The sexes are similar, but young birds are more heavily streaked below than the adults. The call of the protea canary is a trilled tree-lee-loo or a sweet. The song is a loud medley of warbles and trills, with much mimicry. Distribution and habitat It is an endemic resident breeder in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. This species is found in mature protea scrub, tangled valley thickets and forests in the mountains of the Western Cape Province. Its range does not reach the coast. Behaviour The protea canary builds an open cup nest from thin stems and other plant material and lined with plant down. It is placed in a dense bush. The protea canary is less gregarious than other canaries. It tends to be found singly or in pairs, or occasionally in small groups. It is a shy and retiring bird which stays in thick vegetation. When it flies, it soon dives back into cover. It feeds on seeds, (particularly those of proteas, Othonna amplericaules and Rhus anarcardia) and some fruit, nectar and shoots. Insects are occasionally eaten.

The object of the game is to guide a ball along pieces of track by moving tiles like a sliding puzzle. The game's name in Japan is Blodia, an anagram of Diablo, the title of a computer game upon which Blodia is based. Versions of Blodia were released exclusively in Japan for the original Game Boy and the Sharp X68000. A spin-off titled Blodia Land: Puzzle Quest was released for the Famicom, replacing the ball with cartoon dinosaur-like characters. These versions were developed by Tonkin House and published by Broderbund. Gameplay Players must arrange the tiles so the ball traverses all pieces of track. The grid on screen is composed of tiles. Some tiles have a piece of road, and a black tile represents \\"the void\\", an area where one can drag the tile nearby in order to complete a road which will be taken by a ball that will follow the path. Players must arrange the tiles such that the ball traverses all sections of track. The ball can be sped up by pressing a button. If the ball reaches a tile without a piece of track, it falls out of play. The game also includes a level editor which allows for the creation of custom puzzles. An earlier \\"prototype\\" version without the level editor was published for the TI-99/4a and other computers as \\"Diablo\\" in 1985.

Introduced to capture a share in the then-popular beat 'em ups market, it was meant to compete with Techn≈çs' Double Dragon, the leader of the genre at the time. Three years after its release in the arcades and on the Neo Geo AES, it was released on Neo Geo CD as the only other home version. The game is produced by Eikichi Kawasaki, one of SNK's founders and the man behind various well-known SNK titles, such as Fatal Fury and Samurai Shodown series. A re- released version of Burning Fight is included in SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1, which was released for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii in 2008. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot showcasing the first boss. Burning Fight follows a formula and concepts commonly seen in titles of this genre, such as Streets of Rage, Double Dragon and Final Fight: balanced character selection, objects and weapons found on the ground cause greater damage to opponents, and semi-interactive environments (players can damage objects like phone booths and street signs along the way). The game is set in a fictional version of Osaka city (during a train station scene the platform even shows an \\"Umida\\" station sign). There are three playable characters, each with their own levels of strength, agility and special moves: Ryu is quick but weak, Billy is slow but very strong, and Duke is a more balanced hitter. One element that helps the game stand out from its competition is mini-stages, where the player must defeat some enemies in a short period of time in order to win prizes. Antagonists are members of Heiwa-Gumi, a Japanese yakuza gang, though there are a few Caucasian bosses and mid-level bosses (including three wrestling characters, Tom Anderson, Gary Powell and the Mad Dilly, modelled after Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage), and the final boss is Italian mob boss Castella (Casterora in Japanese). Moreover, the game has no individual endings, no matter which character has been chosen. After defeating Castella, players are presented with various scenes of the game along with the credits, and finally a group picture of the main characters.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Burning Fight on their June 15, 1991 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Raiden. While the game was successful critically, it received a lukewarm welcome by fans of the genre. The lack of popularity led the game to fail to have the impact SNK was hoping for and it was left behind its better known competitors. Sinclair User highlighted this sense of dullness by giving the game a rating of 74 and stating that, \\"Burning Fight is a competent journey along the usual beat-'em-up road...\\"  Retrospective reviews  Burning Fight has been met with a much more mixed reception from critics since its release.

In 1936, the university alumnus and trustee Theodore Marburg and his family provided the funds to construct the current building. It was designed by architects Wrenn, Lewis and Jencks, reinterpreting the style of Homewood House, continuing the tradition of Georgian buildings on campus.

Family ƒê√¥n was born in Bordeaux, France. His father was the son of a wealthy Mekong Delta landowner, which allowed him to travel to France to study medicine. It was during this period that ƒê√¥n was born. He returned to France as an adult for his university study. He became a French Army officer when World War II began, later training at √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr, the French equivalent of West Point. Military He returned to Vietnam and served in the French- backed Vietnamese National Army of the French-backed State of Vietnam, fighting against the Vi·ªát Minh in the First Indochina War. ƒê√¥n was a colonel in 1955, when he and then fellow colonel D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh helped Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám establish himself in control of South Vietnam following the Geneva Accords and partition by helping to subdue the private armies of the H√≤a H·∫£o and Cao ƒê√†i religious sects, as well as the B√¨nh Xuy√™n organized crime syndicate. Both were immediately promoted to the rank of general. With the proclamation of the Republic of Vietnam, military officers were faced with becoming Vietnamese citizens if they wanted to remain in their positions. ƒê√¥n became a Vietnamese citizen. ƒê√¥n became Di·ªám's chief of staff and presided over a ceremony in Saigon in which the French-style military rank insignias were burnt and replaced with American-inspired new insignias. In the early 1960s, he commanded the I-Corps of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, which operated in the far north of South Vietnam, in the border region along the demilitarised zone. He led his forces into the mountainous areas of the Central Highlands to flush out pockets of Vi·ªát C·ªông resistance and to prevent further infiltration from North Vietnam. In all, his command took in five provinces. He often came into dispute with Di·ªám's brother, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh C·∫©n, who had his own autonomous private army and secret police and ruled the northern border regions of South Vietnam arbitrarily. ƒê√¥n was removed from command of troops and made the Joint Chief of Staff, where he was confined to an office with no troops. His work was mainly travelling to the airport to greet visiting American dignitaries. Di·ªám feared that the respect that ƒê√¥n commanded could make him a possible rival for power, as the army leadership was selected for the purpose of preserving Di·ªám in power, rather than defeating the communists. ƒê√¥n, then army Chief of Staff, organised discontented officers, and in mid-1963 began meeting with Lucien Conein, a French-born CIA officer in Saigon with whom he culturally related. His closest confidant was his brother- in-law, General L√™ VƒÉn Kim, who was also trained in France. At the time, South Vietnam was gripped by widespread civil unrest due to Diem's suppression of the Buddhist majority, which responded with mass protests. In August, Don led a group of seven generals to meet President Diem and present a request for martial law to disband the groups of monks and their supporters from the temples in Saigon. Also present was ƒê√¥n's brother-in-law L√™ VƒÉn Kim, head of the military academy.Jacobs, pp. 168‚Äì69. ƒê√¥n claimed communists had infiltrated the monks at X√° L·ª£i and warned that ARVN morale was deteriorating because of the civil unrest and consequent disruption of the war effort. He claimed it was possible that the Buddhists could assemble a crowd to march on Gia Long Palace.Hammer, p. 166.Jones, p. 300. Hearing this, Di·ªám agreed to declare martial law effective on the next day, without consulting his cabinet, and troops were ordered into Saigon to occupy strategic points. Don was appointed as the acting Chief of the Armed Forces in place of General L√™ VƒÉn T·ªµ, who was terminally ill with cancer and receiving medical treatment abroad. ƒê√¥n claimed Di·ªám was concerned for the welfare of the monks, allegedly telling the generals that he did not want any of them hurt. The martial law orders were then signed and authorized by ƒê√¥n. The real purpose of ƒê√¥n asking for martial law was to maneuver troops in readiness for a coup, and he had no concrete plans to send the regular army into the pagodas. Nhu sidestepped him and took the opportunity to discredit the army by using Tung's Special Forces and the combat police to attack the pagodas.Karnow, p. 301.Halberstam, pp. 144‚Äì45. After the raids occurred, ƒê√¥n privately met with Conein and reiterated that the Americans were mistaken in believing that the ARVN was responsible. ƒê√¥n insisted that Diem remained in control although Nhu had to approve all of the generals' meetings with Di·ªám. ƒê√¥n insisted Nhu had orchestrated the raids, fearing that the generals had too much power. He asserted that Nhu used the cover of martial law to discredit the generals by dressing the Special Forces in ARVN uniforms. ƒê√¥n insisted that he was unaware of the plans and was at Joint General Staff headquarters when he was informed him of the assaults.Jones, pp. 307‚Äì08. After the pagoda raids, ƒê√¥n was sought out by Do Mau, who wanted to collaborate.Hammer, p. 249. In the wake of the raids, ƒê√¥n attempted to win over General T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh, the commander of the forces which surrounded Saigon, so that he could encircle Di·ªám. ƒê√≠nh, who was regarded as being vain, was reveling after having taken credit for the Pagoda raids, even though they were performed by the Special Forces of Colonel L√™ Quang Tung. ƒê√¥n organised for a national inspection tour with ƒê√≠nh, and played to his ego. ƒê√¥n organised many parties for ƒê√≠nh, and told him that he was a national hero worthy of political authority. He even bribed ƒê√≠nh's soothsayer to predict his elevation to political authority. After ƒê√≠nh asked Di·ªám for the interior ministry post in front of his colleagues and was rebuked and sent off duty in front of his colleagues, ƒê√≠nh changed sides. ƒê√¥n and ƒê√≠nh then signed orders transferring the forces based around M·ªπ Tho, 60 kilometres south of Saigon from General Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Cao, a Di·ªám loyalist, to General Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu C√≥. This gave the plotters complete encirclement of Saigon.  Coup  At 10:00 on 1 November,Karnow, p. 320. US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., General Paul Harkins and Admiral Harry D. Felt, the commander of US forces in the Pacific region, were invited to Gia Long Palace by Di·ªám.Jones, p. 420. ƒê√¥n had scheduled the meeting for the visiting Felt at that time to keep Di·ªám occupied as the troops were moved in and to keep the president in Saigon.Prochnau, p. 464. They were accompanied by ƒê√¥n.Prochnau, pp. 462‚Äì66. Di·ªám gave one of his chain-smoking monologues and said that he would cooperate with US recommendations. Before leaving Saigon, Felt held a press conference with Harkins and ƒê√¥n while the rebels were rolling into the city. Thinking of the situation, ƒê√¥n kept glancing at his watch while waiting for Felt to fly out. The three men were standing as they talked, and ƒê√¥n, overcome by nerves, chewed his gum \\"like a threshing machine\\", and could not stand still, frequently changing his footing as he talked.Prochnau, p. 468. After Felt left, the runway was closed, and ƒê√¥n brushed off Harkins and quickly went away to get ready for the coup. Up to the last minute, Harkins and Felt remained unaware of the imminent coup, despite ƒê√¥n's fidgety behaviour. The pair had paid a visit to ƒê√¥n to discuss military issues at 09:15, but instead of the Vietnamese general hosting his American visitors as Joint General Staff headquarters, as was the norm, ƒê√¥n went to the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam office.Hammer, p. 280. Although Felt was surprised, the Americans did not realise the reason for the unusual venue and then pointed at a map and wondered why two airborne battalions appeared to be idling. ƒê√¥n replied that they were going into battle, and Harkins nodded, unaware that they were entering Saigon. Harkins had told the generals earlier that he opposed a coup, so ƒê√¥n avoided the topic. Felt had been told of the existence of coup plans by Lodge, who falsely informed him that it was not imminent, saying \\"There isn't a Vietnamese general with hair enough on his chest to make it go.\\" Felt later said that ƒê√¥n appeared to be calm and composed.Hammer, p. 281. At 13:00, the plotters summoned many senior officers who were not involved in the plot to the Joint General Staff headquarters at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·ª©t Air Base, on the pretext of a routine lunchtime leadership meeting.Jones, p. 408.Moyar, p. 267. M·∫≠u and ƒê√¥n organised the invitations and set up the trap. At 13:45, ƒê√¥n announced that a coup was taking place, and those who remained loyal to the regime were arrested.Hammer, p. 285. Shortly after 16:00, Di·ªám telephoned JGS headquarters. ƒê√¥n answered and stated \\"the time has come when the army must respond to the wishes of the people\\" because Di·ªám had failed to reform his leadership. The pair had a robust argument and Di·ªám asked the commanders to visit him at the palace to negotiate and work on a reform plan. The generals, remembering that he bought time for loyalists to come to his aid during the 1960 coup attempt by stalling the coup with talks and a false promise of reform and power-sharing, turned down his suggestion.Jones, p. 412. After the coup proved successful, ƒê√¥n promised Di·ªám safe passage from the country, and asked Conein to secure an American aircraft to take the brothers out of the country.Hammer, p. 294. However, but Major Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Nhung, Minh's bodyguard and one of the arresting officers, shot Di·ªám and Nhu. ƒê√¥n maintained that the generals were \\"truly grievous\\" over the deaths, maintaining that they were sincere in their intentions to give Di·ªám a safe exile.Jones, p. 429. ƒê√¥n charged Nhu with convincing Di·ªám to reject the offer, and blamed Minh for the executions, saying \\"I can state without equivocation that this was done by General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh and by him alone.\\"Jones, p. 435.  Junta  ƒê√¥n then served in the Military Revolutionary Council that resulted from the coup as Defense Minister. A civilian government and cabinet led by Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆° was appointed by the MRC to ease some of the workload on non- military matters. However, the presence of ƒê√¥n and ƒê√≠nh in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralyzed the governance process. ƒê√≠nh and ƒê√¥n were subordinate to Th∆° in the cabinet, but as members of the MRC they were superior to him. Whenever Th∆° gave an order in the civilian hierarchy with which they disagreed, they would go into the MRC and give a counter- order.Jones, p. 437. During this time, Minh, Don and Tho wanted to coax back non-communist dissidents and isolate those that were communists. They later said that they believed the Americans had become aware of this and grown hostile to them.Kahin, p. 185. At the same time, in accordance with the political strategy, the MRC was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans,Kahin, p. 186. who wanted large-scale bombing of North Vietnam.Kahin, pp. 192‚Äì195.  Overthrow  A group of officers, led by Generals Nguyen Khanh, Tran Thien Khiem and Do Mau were unhappy with their posts after the 1963 coup, and began plotting. Incriminating documents were concocted to purportedly show that Generals Minh, Kim and ƒê√¥n had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the American presence in Saigon and were brought to the attention of some senior American officials.Shaplen, p. 232. Kh√°nh told various American officials that ƒê√¥n, Kim and General Mai H·ªØu Xu√¢n, along with Minh, were \\"pro-French and pro-neutralist\\" and part of French President Charles de Gaulle's plan to neutralise Vietnam. Kh√°nh claimed that the fact that ƒê√¥n had invited two members of the French National Assembly‚Äîboth from de Gaulle's party‚Äîto dinner. According to one source, Kim and Minh were also present, while another said that Kim, ƒê√≠nh and Xu√¢n were there.Kahin, p. 197.Logevall, p. 162. Kh√°nh alleged at the time that the generals discussed neutralization there, while ƒê√¥n and ƒê√≠nh always denied it.Kahin, p. 198. Another incident that occurred publicly was a January trip by ƒê√¥n and ƒê√≠nh to Thailand's capital Bangkok for a military event was a press conference at which ƒê√¥n did not rule out de Gaulle's plan if it applied to both Vietnams equally. Lodge passed a report to Washington on January 20, alleging that ƒê√¥n and ƒê√≠nh were potential leaders of a group that might go along with de Gaulle's neutralization plan. He said that ƒê√¥n and Kim retained their French citizenship and \\"had never at any time foresworn the possibility of a neutral solution at what might seem to them the proper time.\\"Blair, p. 113. He said that although he thought their policies against the communists were effective, \\"none of us had ever discussed what the next step would be after the Government of Vietnam had reached a position of strength. Perhaps they did favor the French neutrality solution at that time.\\" On January 30, Kh√°nh launched a coup, arresting Minh, Dinh, ƒê√¥n and Kim, claiming that they were part of a neutralist plot with the Vi·ªát C·ªông and taken to ƒê√† L·∫°t. Kh√°nh noted that they had served in the Vietnamese National Army in the early 1950s, under the French colonial administration, although he did as well. The day after coming to power, Kh√°nh further claimed to Lodge that ƒê√¥n was in possession of briefing papers from the Americans on plans for the bombing of North Vietnam and said that they were in danger of being handed over to the communists.Blair, p. 115. In May 1964, Khanh put his rivals on trial. The generals were secretly interrogated for five and a half hours, mostly about details of their coup against Di·ªám, rather than the original charge of promoting neutralism. As all of the officers were involved in the plot against Di·ªám, this did not reveal any information new to them. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Kh√°nh stated, \\"We ask that once you begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody\\".Langguth, pp. 289‚Äì291. The tribunal then \\"congratulated\\" the generals, but found that they were of \\"lax morality\\" and unqualified to command due to a \\"lack of a clear political concept\\". They were chastised for being \\"inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility\\" and of letting \\"their subordinates take advantage of their positions\\". The four imprisoned generals were allowed to remain in Da Lat under surveillance with their families. However, there were reports that the trial ended in a festive manner akin to a party, as the officers shook hands and made up with one another. All four generals were barred from commanding troops for a period; Kim was banned for six years, and ƒê√¥n 18 months. Offices were prepared for the quartet so that they could participate in \\"research and planning\\". Worried that the group of idle officers would plot against him, Kh√°nh made some preliminary arrangements to send them to the United States for military study, but this fell through.Shaplen, pp. 244‚Äì245.Karnow, p. 355. When Kh√°nh was himself deposed in 1965, he handed over dossiers proving that the four generals were innocent;Langguth, p. 347. the original documents that Kh√°nh claimed proved his accusations of neutralism were neither presented to nor found by anyone.  Brief restoration  In September, Khanh survived a coup attempt by Generals Duong Van Duc and Lam Van Phat after the intervention of the 'Young Turks' faction of Nguyen Chanh Thi and Air Force chief Nguyen Cao Ky. To try and counter-act the increasing power of the latter, on November 14, Kh√°nh brought back Don as the deputy chief of staff. However, the Young Turks were cognizant of Kh√°nh's motives, and continued to pressure him to sideline Don and Dinh in an attempt to gain more power for themselves.Kahin, p. 232. The Young Turks then decided to try and sideline Don and the Da Lat generals by introducing a policy to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic and ineffective, but most importantly, rivals for power.Moyar (2004), p. 769. However, a civilian advisory body named the High National Council, composed mostly of old men, disagreed with this policy, and after refusing to approve it, the Young Turks launched a coup in December 1964 to remove the HNC.Shaplen, p. 294. In February 1965, Don was again in view as Phat and Colonel Pham Ngoc Thao made another attempt to overthrow Khanh with the support of Catholic elements aligned with the Dai Viet Quoc Dan Dang and Diemist sympathisers. American intelligence analysts thought ƒê√¥n was involved in the coup, but altered their assessment when he stayed in Da Lat instead of heading for the capital.Kahin, p. 514. Eight months after the coup was over, ƒê√¥n told the American historian George McTurnan Kahin that he had been plotting with Th·∫£o, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but said the Dai Viet had insisted on installing the Catholic Khi√™m. A month earlier, American intelligence analysts thought Th·∫£o was planning to replace Kh√°nh as commander-in-chief with Don.Kahin, p. 512. Political service In 1965, ƒê√¥n retired and was elected to the Senate in 1967 after topping the elections. He later served as the defense minister, until 29 April 1975, leaving for the United States one day before the fall of Saigon.

At the end, McCartney is left alone in the middle of the room, bends on his knee and fades away slowly.

Grounds The club plays its matches at Ingleburn south of Sydney, New South Wales. In the summer months (January, February, and March) the club base itself in Queens Park in the eastern suburbs. Queens Park is located 6 km east of the Sydney central business district, near Centennial Park. (West of Waverley and Charing Cross, south of Bondi Junction and north of Randwick). Training is on Tuesday and Thursday nights at 7 pm. History Set-up in 1969, the club took to the field and contested in competition - narrowly missing out on silverware in its first year. In 1970 however, the club took home the championship trophy. As a result of this win Young Ireland were rewarded with the chance to represent the New South Wales GAA in the Australian inter-state competition. The club recorded a 6-point win against another Young Ireland of Melbourne in Wagga Wagga. In 1989, Young Ireland became the first Gaelic football team to have a sponsor's name on its jerseys, when Mike Hughes Finance became sponsors. In 1990, the club was invited to take part in an exhibition game against Wolfetones of Melbourne as the curtain-raiser to the Ireland v's Australia International Rules match. The New South Wales Gaelic Athletic Association has named its three main trophy's in honour of deceased club members. Namely: Seamus Dowling (Championship), Tom Kearney (League) and James McGirr (Inter Provincial).

The crest is of a Gaelic football which sits on a map of Ireland which in turn sits on a map of Australia. The background image is of a traditional celtic cross with a round border. The writing in the border is Young Ireland Sydney Australia with 1969 the year of the club's founding. On the side are the letters NSW GAA to signify the club's state of origin.

Through the service, subscribers would use a device, called the PlayCable adapter, to download the games for play on their Intellivision. It was the first service that allowed users to download games for play on a video game console. PlayCable was not widely adopted, due in part to high costs for users and operators, as well as limitations of the PlayCable adapter. The service was discontinued in 1983. History PlayCable was developed as a joint venture between Mattel and General Instrument. The PlayCable service was deep in development even before the Intellivision was widely released. In 1979, tests of the service were announced for several cities, including Moline, Illinois, Jackson, Mississippi and Boise, Idaho. The service was officially launched in 1981. Subscriptions were available for a monthly fee, allowing users access to a selection of games through cable television providers that supported the service. Up to 20 titles were available each month. Former professional baseball player Mickey Mantle appeared in commercials for the service. According to a CED Magazine article, the service was available in thirteen cities in 1981 including Fayetteville, N.Y. However, in spring 1983 the available market totalled 650,000 households. The less than 3% subscription rate was still higher than the rate of Intellivision sales in markets where PlayCable was not available, and Intellivision Productions reports that PlayCable was popular where available. Cable operators complained about the high cost of the computer needed to run the service as well as the cost of the in-home PlayCable adapters; the adapters proved to be inadequate to run the larger Intellivision games being produced. In addition, Mattel Electronics was losing millions of dollars due to the video game industry crash of 1983 and stopped all new hardware development in August that year. Initial estimates by Mattel projected that the service would have 1 million subscribers within five years, however PlayCable was discontinued in 1983, three years after it was introduced. Implementation and limitations The PlayCable channel was broadcast through special data channels within the FM Band of the cable line. A PlayCable adapter peripheral would be inserted into the cartridge slot of the Intellivision Master Component and connected to the cable line. This adapter contained an FM radio receiver, digital interface, 512 word firmware ROM and 8K of RAM for game storage. When turned on, the firmware within the PlayCable adapter tuned its FM receiver to the PlayCable catalog channel, always broadcast at 107.7MHz, and downloaded a program to the adapter's RAM that displayed a menu of titles that could be played. Users then selected a title using the Intellivision controller keypad. Having chosen a game, the adapter would re-tune the receiver to the channel broadcasting the selected title, wait for the start of the code to appear in the data stream and download it to the adapter's internal memory for play. Depending on the size of the game, the entire loading process took an average of between 10 and 20 seconds. The 8K of memory inside PlayCable adapters proved to be insufficient for the larger games that Mattel started to release in 1983. To this point PlayCable was compatible with 90% of Mattel's catalogue of Intellivision titles, with only Chess and three Intellivoice games proving problematic. Compatibility fell with the introduction of 12K and 16K titles, such as Pinball and Bump N Jump, and the release of games dependent on the Intellivision Entertainment Computer System (ECS). Despite this, PlayCable compatibility with the full 61 game Mattel catalogue was still above 75% when Mattel Electronics closed its Intellivision business in early 1984.

It was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1971, noted as a family home of Maryland's Carroll family. It, along with Evergreen Museum & Library, make up the Johns Hopkins University Museums. History The Homewood Estate was offered as a wedding gift in 1800 by Charles Carroll of Carrollton, (1737-1832), the longest surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, to his son Charles Carroll Jr. It occupied acres in northern Baltimore and was first known as \\"Merryman's Lott.\\" Carroll had purchased the parcel of land in 1794. Charles Carroll Jr. began construction on a stately and modern country home of his own design in 1801 and had mostly finished by 1808. It cost $40,000, four times the budgeted expense. For reasons both personal and political, \\"Homewood\\" led to a severe breach in relations between father and son. Ultimately, Carroll (Senior) bought the house from his son in 1824 and managed the \\"most improvident waste\\" until his son's death the next year. The house then passed to Charles Carroll III, (the grandson), who lived there until he inherited the rural landmark family estate, Doughoregan Manor (in modern Howard County), from his grandfather. The house was the birthplace of John Lee Carroll in 1830, second son of Charles Carroll, III, who would become Governor of Maryland. In 1839, Charles Carroll III sold Homewood to Samuel Wyman, a Baltimore merchant, who lived there with his family until 1865. During the Wyman family's tenure, Wyman's son William commissioned Richard Upjohn to build an Italianate mansion on the grounds, named \\"Homewood Villa.\\" The Villa was demolished by Johns Hopkins University in 1954; however, the gatehouse to the estate remains, and can be seen as an example of the villa design. On Samuel Wyman's death the property was divided between his sons. In 1897, Homewood House became the first Gilman School, known at its founding as The Country School for Boys. In 1902 the property was reassembled and given to Johns Hopkins University. In 1916 the mansion became the University Faculty Club. In 1936, Homewood was converted to offices for the university president and deans. Johns Hopkins University now operates Homewood Museum, which opened to the public in 1987, and its Federal-style architecture, with its red brick and white marble, serves as the inspiration for the campus' design. First floor plan Architecture Homewood exhibits a Palladian-inspired five-part plan, that reflects harmony in the proportions and sophisticated details in its construction. The five-part plan is based on a central block comprising the main residence, with flanking pavilions or dependencies linked to the center by hyphens. The house, while planned and massed in the Georgian style, uses Federal-style detailing, reflecting influences of the English architecture of Robert Adam. While Georgian architecture has significant surface relief, the Federal style is flatter, with smaller-scale details, as seen at Homewood. The four-columned portico dominates the main elevation. The 1¬Ω story central block was the center for formal entertainment, with a reception room, dining room and drawing room on the south side. The west wing was devoted to services, such as kitchens, while the east wing was for family use, on a more intimate basis than the main house. Unlike many five-part houses in the area, the central block did not have a full second floor, causing bedrooms and family areas to move into the wings. Homewood is furnished today as it would have been in the 19th century. It is home to the Homewood Museum, which features period furnishings that complement its architecture.

Background During the 1960s America was involved in the Vietnam War. This war was a controversial one because many people were against the United States' involvement in South Vietnam. Adding to the tension of the Americans against the war was the emergence of a generation of people who were a part of the counter-culture and believed that they should do anything possible to go against the establishment. The counter-culture generation decided that Central Park would be the perfect host for their demonstrations. In 1965, citizens of New York experienced their first blow against their freedom of speech as Commissioner, Newbold Morris, refused to give them a permit that they would need in order to use a section of the park for anti-war speeches. Opponents of the ban called it a form of discrimination. In 1967, Parks Commissioner August Heckscher II said that Central Park would no longer be allowed to serve as a venue for mass demonstrations because they were disruptive and caused damages to the park which were costly. After Hecksher was met with great opposition by protestors who held up unauthorized banners and burned draft cards in the park anyway, he decided to set up designated areas just for these types of demonstrations such as Randall's Island. As a part of the compromise made by the New York Civil Liberties Union, a separate area in Central Park was set aside for big demonstrations. History=1967 1967 draft card burning in Sheep Meadow in Central Park On New Year's Eve 1967, a group of one thousand people accompanied by music and geese burned down a Christmas tree in Central Park. The city's Parks Commissioner, Thomas P.F. Hoving, was present at the event. About this demonstration, he stated, \\"We're going to do this again‚Ä¶ you know, it's old hat to go to Times Square when we can have such a wonderful happening in Central Park\\". The Easter 1967 be-in was organized by Jim Fouratt an actor, Paul Williams editor of Crawdaddy! magazine, Susan Hartnett head of the Experiments in Art and Technology organization and Chilean poet and playwright Claudio Badal. With a budget of $250 they printed 3,000 posters and 40,000 small notices designed by Peter Max and distributed them around the city. The Police and Parks Departments quietly and unofficially cooperated with the organizers. An estimated 10,065 people participated in the event at the Sheep Meadow in Central Park. The majority of participants were hippies. They were joined by families who had attended the Easter parade and members of the Spanish community who were notified of the event by Spanish language posters. The New York Times described them as \\"poets from the Bronx, dropouts from the East Village, interior decorators from the East Side, teachers from the West Side and teeny boppers from Long Island\\" and said that \\"they wore carnation petals and paper stars and tiny mirrors on foreheads, paint around the mouth and cheeks, flowering bedsheets, buttons and tights\\". The event was guarded by small number of police. At 6:45 a.m. the first police car arrived. The car was covered with flowers while the crowd chanted of \\"daffodil power\\" at which point the police quickly retreated. While police held their distance most of the day, 5 officers did approach two nude participants, at which point the officers were surrounded while the crowd chanted \\"We love cops/\\"Turn on cops\\". The situation was defused when the crowd at the urging of other participants backed off. At 7:30 at night the police beamed lights on the group and used bullhorns to tell participants to disperse. Again the police were rushed by participants. Following a brief period of tension the police decided to let the event continue. Black and white film footage from this event appears in the 1972 film Ciao! Manhattan. Less than a month later, on April 15, another anti-war rally took place as a part of the \\"Spring Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam\\". Once again the number of demonstrators grew drastically to an estimated 100‚Äì400 thousand attendees. This peace rally, which assembled and started off in Central Park and then marched to the United Nations, was said to be the largest of its kind at its time. The demonstrators ranged from Sioux Indians from South Dakota to members of the African American community all rallying for one cause, peace. There was a peace fair, which featured performances by folk singers and rock groups. People held signs that read \\"Don't Make Vietnam an American Reservation\\" \\"Make Love not War\\" and \\"No Vietnamese Ever Called Me Nigger\\". The protesters then made their way from Central Park to the U.N., where speeches were given by several leaders including Benjamin Spock, James Bevel, and Martin Luther King, Jr.. Dr. King declared that the war in Vietnam was a \\"conflict against a coloured people\\" and that \\"white Americans are not going to deal in the problems of coloured people when they're exterminating a whole nation of coloured people\\". Although there were five arrests made during this demonstration, they were of counter- demonstrators who staged an Anti-Communist rally. Around 75 protesters burned their draft cards. Later that spring the counter-culture revolution continued in Central Park but this time \\"Armed with electric guitars\\". About 450 people attended the concert. Various bands such as the Grateful Dead performed for the gatherers who originally were scheduled to gather in Tompkins Square Park but was forced to move to Central Park. The New York Times described the attendees as \\"young people, some with bare feet and others wearing sandals or socks who did some moderately contortionate dancing at first. But then the pace quickly changed and soon they were jumping around like rag dolls being jerked by wires\\". 1968 During 1968, the Peace Rally and the Easter Be-In were combined into a single event. About 90,000 people ranging from veterans to religious groups to African Americans to Puerto Ricans to women groups to labor groups to students gathered at Sheep Meadow. Amongst the speakers at this particular demonstration was Coretta Scott King who spoke in place of her husband, Martin Luther King Jr. who had been assassinated earlier on April 4. In her speech she said: \\"The inter-relatedness of domestic and foreign affairs is no longer questioned\\". The Village Voice described the crowd as apathetic and said there was a feeling that this had all been done before.Sunday in the Park: Yip-Out or Has-Been? Village Voice April 18, 1968 1969 During the early 1969 Be-In/Peace Rally, the Village Voice reported that there was said to be between 15,000‚Äì20,000 people in attendance. This be-in became more radical than the other be-ins that previously took place in Central Park as bonfires erupted. One person described Sheep Meadow as having \\"the aura of a bombed out battlefield\\". Things became even worse when one person leapt into one of the bonfires. When he was finally pulled from the bonfires by other demonstrators, word came out that an ambulance would not arrive until Sheep Meadow was cleared. Because the crowd would not disperse, the man had to be carried through the crowd to be transported to the hospital. In addition to this, three police officers were injured when the demonstrators hit them with rocks. In November 1969, protesters took a different approach and organized a lie-in at Sheep Meadow in Central Park. About three thousand protesters laid out blankets on Sheep meadow and held white and black balloons used to symbolize those killed and those potentially killed in the war in Vietnam.\\"Supporters of the Vietnam moratorium lie in the Sheep Meadow of New York‚Äôs Central Park Nov. 14, 1969...\\" This lie-in was met with opposition from some city officials and some members of the general public. The demonstrators were met with this opposition because of the message that they were trying to get across and because of the usage of the city's public space. 1970 On June 28, 1970, there was a massive Gay Be-In\\" held in Sheep Meadow to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots. The Gay march went from Washington Place in Greenwich Village uptown on Sixth Avenue to end with a \\"gay-in\\" in Sheep's Meadow.

Retrieved 2010-17-12 In Greenland, wild reindeer have been hunted as a source of food, clothing, shelter, and tools by the Inuit - the indigenous peoples that populate the Arctic and colder regions. Methods that they have employed include crossbow, bow and arrow, snares, driving, trapping pits, driving them off cliffs or into lakes and then spearing them from kayaks, and now using modern firearms. The entire reindeer, including fur, skin, antlers, and bones have been used. Their meat, viscera, internal organs, and even stomach contents, have all been utilized as food, both raw, dried, smoked, and cooked. Today reindeer are primarily hunted by residents and tourists for their meat, but mature animals may also be the objects of trophy hunting because of the often large size of their antlers. They have the largest antlers relative to body size among deer.New World Deer (Capriolinae) Retrieved 2010-17-12 In Greenland more reindeer are harvested than any other big game land mammal species. Reindeer meat is an important staple in most households, and the populace waits with great anticipation for the autumn hunting season to begin. It is an opportunity to stock up the kitchen pantry and freezer with meat for the coming season and to enjoy the adventure of the hunt. Game harvesting conditions in Greenland can be extreme, and the unpredictable forces of nature can be hazardous to hunters. Greenland is large and long with differing hunting customs and regulations, as well as weather patterns, depending on the region and season. The Greenland wilderness is sensitive and hunters are expected to respect it and \\"leave nothing but footprints.\\"  Inuit identity: hunting and reindeer = Cultural status of the hunting experience  Hunting has always been an extremely important aspect of the Greenland Inuit culture: : \\"The Inuit culture is the most pure hunting culture in existence.

Without human monitoring and regulation, mass starvation of reindeer would be a recurring problem. Harvesting recommendations are also based on other prognostic factors, among them estimates of reindeer population density, total population in various regions, and availability of adequate food sources.Interesting demo programs for estimating populations. Porcupine Caribou Population Model: Demo Versions. - Taiga Net, operated by the Arctic Borderlands Ecological Knowledge Society Since these estimates are difficult to make and can vary over time for each region, the recommendations and quotas are constantly adapted to the local needs, sometimes quite radically. Historically, Greenland's reindeer population has fluctuated widely. For example, it numbered around 100,000 in the early 1970s and then was believed to have dropped to about 9,000 in 1993.Baldursson S.

Quotas were then radically increased and the hunting season was lengthened: \\"In an effort to reduce caribou number and density, open harvests were continued in 2003, 2004 and 2005.\\" In 2005, improved counting methods revealed that the previous estimates had indeed been misleading and that the population density was far too high, with 3-4 caribou per km2, rather than the preferred 1.2 per km2. In 2006 the number of reindeer was estimated to be more than 100,000, which was still too many animals.The propagation of reindeer in Greenland. - Greenland Tourism and Business Council A constant concern is that overpopulation can lead to increased mortality of calves, damage to feeding grounds, and a population crash: :\\"Independent of climate and genetics, caribou calf mortality increases with high population density and grazing pressure.... [O]ver-abundance of caribou on the range may be a current problem, which may soon become an acute problem. Unfortunately, it is unknown how much longer the present range can continue to support the current caribou numbers. If the herds are allowed to continue status quo or increase further there is a clear risk of lasting damage to ranges. If the ranges are destroyed, caribou stocks can be expected to crash. Scientists and hunters continue to work together for the best good of all concerned parties: the reindeer, the hunters, the general populace of Greenland, and the very sensitive and vulnerable range grounds, since Greenland's tundra is more sensitive than elsewhere in the Arctic due to the ever-present inland ice sheet. This ice sheet acts like an open refrigerator door, stunting the growth of vegetation along the coastal regions and making recovery a slow process.

Greenland animals can vary considerably in size, with females weighing up to 90 kg (198 lb) and the males (\\"bulls\\") 150 kg (331 lb). Other species of reindeer can be larger or smaller. In Greenland both sexes may be hunted. Although they have antlers, they rarely use them against humans, even when backed into a corner by the Sami people who herd, milk, and slaughter them for food in other lands. Their usual defense against humans is to pull away or flee, often uphill. Males use their antlers when sparring against each other, and reindeer may use them as a last resort to defend themselves and their young against predators such as wolves,Dawes, Elander, Ericson The Wolf (Canis lupus) in Greenland: A Historical Review and Present Status.

Three subspecies in Greenland  Three subspecies of reindeer live in western Greenland where some interbreeding has occurred: # The most common variety of reindeer in Greenland is the native wild barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus), which is a medium-sized race of reindeer also found in Canada. #thumbThe second type are the feral (semi-domestic) mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), brought from Norway in 1952. They are larger and were first introduced at a game reserve in the Kapisillit region of Godth√•b's fjord.

Transportation to and from hunting areas is nearly always done by boat. The rest of the transportation is by foot. If the hunting area is far inland, it may involve carrying equipment to a lake, and then transporting it across the lake to a campsite using a smaller type of boat, such as a rowboat, canoe (including collapsible models), or a rubber inflatable boat. Some lakes have boats permanently left (or hidden in the bushes) near the shores, and they are sometimes used by hunters (not necessarily the owners) who frequent the area. In 2006 the only hunting weapons allowed for reindeer harvesting were bolt action, non-automatic rifles, using .222 Remington caliber cartridges or larger.Lars Bj√∏rkn√¶s. Gr√∏nlands lovsamling 2006. - Hjemmestyrets bekendtg√∏relse nr. 18 af 18. juli 1995 om fredning af og jagt p√• rensdyr. A good, large rifle scope is important, as shots at longer distances may be necessary, and visibility may be poor because of snowfall, fog, or limited lighting levels. Folding or fixed-blade hunting knives are necessary for many purposes. Binoculars with large objective diameter are used to spot prey at great distances, sometimes in waning light. Rifles (both bolt action and semi- automatic) of other calibers, shotguns, and other types of weapons may be used for other game such as ptarmigan, Arctic hares, and Arctic foxes, which are often encountered during a reindeer hunt.  Regulations and hunting licenses  Harvesting is governed by regulations and requires a hunting license indicating the number of animals to be harvested, as well as post-hunting reporting of results (a jawbone with teeth). Such licenses can be obtained by those who have established two years of residency. Special arrangements are made for tourists and trophy hunters. Information can be sought and licenses obtained (by application and payment) from the local municipality. Airplanes, helicopters, and other motorized vehicles (such as snowmobiles),Rensdyrjagt fra snescooter er forbudt. Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa, Greenland National Broadcasting Company, 11. February 2007 are not allowed to be used for hunting or land transport of animals or hunters. Boats are allowed for transport to and from hunting areas. A lead identification tag must be attached to the carcass until it is sold or used. The meat is owned by the hunter and no extra fees are charged for it. In 2006 the open season extended from August 10 - September 15. In exceptional cases the dates can be changed, for example periods of bad weather and too much ice, resulting in a lengthening of the season.Forl√¶ngelse af jagtperiode Winter hunting is an option for those specially licensed as commercial hunters (normally reserved for Inuit residents).  Game preparation and transport  Hunter using a headband to drag a reindeer on snow Once downed, a reindeer is quickly field dressed by removing the viscera. The skin, head, and viscera are often discarded and left for consumption by foxes, ravens, and other birds. The meat is kept cool to minimize decomposition and protected from blow-flies by the use of mesh game bags, and any fly eggs (very visible) and maggots are removed immediately.Willy Zimmer. The tough stuff. - Casper Star-Tribune, September 23, 2004, Rocky Mountain Elk FoundationMarty Prokop. How to Field Dress a Deer The cool climate makes it possible for the meat to be kept out in the open longer than in warmer climates, therefore a hunting expedition can last several days without a serious loss of meat quality. Once home again, the meat can be hung and aged for a few days before further processing.E. Dan Klepper. Hang'em High. - Texas Parks and Wildlife Magazine, November 2005 Carrying a reindeer over a long distance in rugged mountainous terrain can be difficult and very strenuous. More than five kilometers each way is not uncommon. If the animal is very large, it may only be possible to transport one half at a time. In Greenland, reindeer meat is commonly carried over the shoulders,Meat for transport Carrying meat Images showing transportation of meat possibly tied to a backpack frame, or carried on the back with support from a headband, the last being a method preferred by the Inuit. Unskinned game may also be dragged on snow, or allowed to slide down steep, snow-covered hillsides, thus saving much work and freeing the hands for support while climbing downhill.  Hunting methods  Hunter carrying reindeer meat There are several hunting strategies that can be used for harvesting reindeer: * Asking is seeking the advice of an experienced reindeer hunter. * Scouting is a variety of tasks and techniques for finding reindeer to hunt. :* Glassing is the use of optical instruments (such as binoculars) to locate animals more easily. * Blind or stand hunting is waiting where reindeer are likely to travel. * Camouflage hunting is concealing oneself visually to blend in with the environment, for example using a white anorak in snowy weather. * Still hunting is the practice of walking stealthily in search of animals. * Stalking is the practice of walking stealthily in pursuit of identified animals. * Tracking is interpreting and following physical evidence in the pursuit of animals. * Drive hunting is flushing reindeer toward other hunters. Note: Loose dogs, dog driving, and coursing are not allowed in Greenland.  Hunting conditions in Greenland  A reindeer hunt can be a short afternoon outing without much equipment, or a week-long affair with all the equipment that such an endeavor requires. New hunters may experience a form of culture shockColin Fletcher, in The Complete Walker the first time they enter the wilderness, and may require mental acclimatization when returning to civilization. It may feel like a fleeting period of mental confusion, similar to the \\"sea legs\\" felt by inexperienced boaters. Reindeer harvesting can be done in groups or alone, with lone hunting generally requiring extra safety precautions. While reindeer harvesting is usually a pleasant experience and the following problems may never be encountered, it can also be exhausting and does entail some degree of safety risk. Good hygiene and adequate hydration can protect against infections, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis. A small first aid kit should be carried when away from the campsite or boat, and preparations should be made for the various hazards of outdoor recreation. The terrain can be hilly, mountainous, uneven, and stony, with hidden crevices or holes. It may also be marshy, muddy, and wet. It may be necessary to cross streams and rivers, and slippery rocks present a hazard. If there is snow and ice, there can be cornices, crevasses, and avalanches, although snow can make it easier to spot and track reindeer. The weather during the beginning of the autumn hunting season is often pleasant, relatively warm, and mild, but it can change very quickly. Hunters may encounter fog, rain, wind, and winter conditions. Occasionally the situation can quickly approach a worst-case scenario with events such as katabatic winds, storms, snow, hail, sleet, freezing rain, blizzards, and polar cyclones, even in the late summer. Lack of preparation can have fatal consequences.

Failure to calculate correctly can send a hunter in the wrong direction, leading to complete loss of bearings. Getting lost in bad weather can waste precious time, forcing the hunter to overnight in very wet, cold, and unpleasant conditions. Hypothermia can further complicate matters and decrease the hunter's ability to think clearly, causing them to lose their bearings even more. A fight for survival may then ensue. Deaths are relatively rare, but they do happen.

King Fox came to prominence after entering a talent competition. King Fox's entry was an original song called \\"Unforgotten Dreams\\". The song generated a strong public reaction when played on air, and became a Top 5 hit in Sydney, charting for over four months. Line up After early changes, the band settled into the lineup of: *Paul Radcliffe - guitar, vocals, flute *David King - guitar, vocals *Billy Field - bass, vocals *Peter Muller - organ, vocals *Andy Evans - drums History King Fox came to prominence in Sydney in mid-1969 after entering a talent competition run by Sydney radio station 2UW and independent producer Martin Erdman. The group's average age was 16 at the time. King Fox's entry was an original song called \\"Unforgotten Dreams\\", an atmospheric psych-pop original written by Radcliffe and King, featuring flute by Radcliffe. It was produced by Martin Erdman and recorded at his studio in just one hour. The song generated a strong public reaction when played on air, and King Fox ended up being one of four groups out of more than 150 whose work was selected for release as a single on Erdman's Du Monde Records. \\"Unforgotten Dreams\\" became a Top 5 hit in Sydney, charting for over four months, a feat that was also remarkable because of the song's length, 4 min 56 sec, almost double the average length of a pop single at that time. In January 1970, during the summer vacation, King Fox recorded an album at Erdman's World of Sound Studios in Ramsgate, the first recordings to be made on Erdman's newly purchased 4-track recording gear. Most accounts of King Fox mention the affluence of the members' home suburbs. It has often been claimed that the band broke up in 1970 when the boys' instruments, payrolled by their parents, were confiscated because they were neglecting their studies. This however is not true‚Äîin a recent interview on the ABC-TV current affairs show Stateline, Radcliffe and King revealed that the parents of the group members demanded an end to the band after Sydney tabloid the Sunday Mirror published an intrusive article about the band which named the private schools that several of the boys attended and mocked their supposedly affluent family backgrounds. Post breakup The group briefly reformed in 1972 and released one unsuccessful single on the Festival Records label, but broke up permanently soon after. The tracks the band had recorded for their proposed LP were never mixed or released at the time, because the group broke up just days after the last track was recorded. Erdman long thought that the tapes had been lost after he moved his studio, but they were rediscovered a few years ago and in May 2007 Radcliffe and Erdman mixed the tracks and the 'lost' recordings, which were then compiled with the other existing King Fox tracks on the CD 70207: The (Un)Forgotten Album, which was released on the revived Du Monde imprint in May 2008. Bassist Billy Field went on to establish the renowned Paradise Studios in Sydney in 1979, and he then launched a solo career as a piano playing singer-songwriter. He had two nationwide hits in 1981 with \\"Bad Habits\\" and \\"You Weren't In Love With Me\\" (a national #1), and his album Bad Habits was a best-seller.

The suburb is on Lady Robinson Beach, at Botany Bay, in Bayside Council. Prior to 1970 the official name for the suburb was Brighton-le-Sands, a name which remained in use for many years after the official change of the name. This history concentrates on the period after European settlement to the 1970s. Names The spelling of the suburb was originally Brighton-le-Sands, using a lower case \\"l\\" in \\"le\\" (SMH) until it was officially changed in 1970, although the reason for this change is not clear. Both versions of the name are used, as well as the alternative Brighton Le Sands (without the hyphens). Other names in common use are Brighton and Brighton Beach. In this article, the name is spelt as it was in the original source: CER, TD. The 1992 Sydney Telephone Directory used the notation Brighton-le-Sands when referring to the suburb and its occupants: see entries in the 1992 telephone directory. European settlement Settlements developed along the shores of Lady Robinson Beach in the 19th century. By 1870 there were settlements close to Muddy Creek. One of these settlements, the hamlet which developed along its coastline, east of Rockdale, was called Lady Robinson's Beach for a brief period in the 1880s. This hamlet grew into the suburb of 'Brighton-le-Sands'. Boundaries Lady Robinson Beach and Cook Park form the eastern border of Brighton-Le-Sands, on Botany Bay, south of Port Jackson. This section of Lady Robinson beach is also commonly referred to as Brighton Beach or Brighton Le Sands Beach. The northern boundary of Brighton-Le-Sands is Bestic Street. President Avenue forms the southern boundary. To the west the boundary is more tortuous. Initially it runs along Muddy Creek, through White Oak Reserve to Bruce Street where the boundary turns west along Bruce Street. It continues south briefly just east of West Botany Street running south-east down Bay Street until it is just east of Aero Street. From here the boundary runs in a straight line in a south-westerly direction to President Avenue, immediately north of the lakes of the Rockdale Bicentemmial Park: see Sydways Street Directory, 2001. 19th century development of Lady Robinson's Beach=Early land acquisitions Land acquisitions in the district began in the 1840s but no significant development occurred until the railway opened to Hurstville, via Rockdale in 1884: see New South Wales Government Gazettes, POD. In 1877 it was decided to extend Bay Street, Rockdale to the coast. Before this extension could proceed it was necessary to build a bridge over Muddy Creek, a tributary of Cooks River. Then in 1880 Bestic Street, Rockdale was also extended by linking it to Goode's Road. The two roads were slightly out of alignment which accounts for the slight bend present in Bestic Street. Making this link necessitated a second bridge over Muddy Creek. In 1883 Thomas Saywell suggested extending the road to the beach: Archives Rockdale Municipal Library, POD. Building the tramway Following the completion of the railway Thomas Saywell decided, in 1885, to construct a tramway along Bay Street from Rockdale to Lady Robinson Beach. It was a single track except at each terminus and for a short section at the Farr Street stop to allow trams to pass mid-way along the track. A tram depot was erected south of West Botany Street on land which is now Tony Baker Reserve: CER, POD, Street Directories. Saywell had a 30-year lease on the tramway. In 1914 the Government of the day took control of the tramway. Eventually the tramline was electrified: SMH 28 July 1900 p11. The tram was replaced by buses in 1949. It took another ten years before the old tram tracks were removed and Bay Street was re-surfaced to assist with the problems ensuing from the increasing number of cars now using the road: Archives Rockdale Municipal Library, POD. There are many references to this tramway in the Sydney Morning Herald\\", now available on the internet, q,v. 1890s The land may have been unsuitable for agriculture but its location was ideal for a pleasure resort. The region was well served by public transport in an era and in a country where travelling was still difficult. Access to Rockdale had been difficult. Initially the route to the area was via what is now Canterbury, then by horse coach across a dam spanning Cooks River at Tempe. When road and rail bridges replaced the dam carriageway in the 1880s progress ensued. Travelling to Rockdale, and hence to Brighton, became easier: Archives Rockdale Municipal Library. Thomas Saywell suggested the name New Brighton Estate for the developing settlement. The beach reminded him of Brighton beach in England and so he began to develop the resort he envisaged, similar to the English seaside resort: Archives Rockdale Municipal Library. Thomas Saywell first built the public swimming baths which were completed in the late 1880s. There were actually two bathing areas, one for men and one for women with a wharf between. Amateur fishermen lined the shores of the bay or fished from small water craft and the promenade of the baths. Nearby, on the south west corner of Bay Street and Grand Parade, adjacent to the new tram terminus, he established a picnic area, later known as the Shady Nook Recreation Grounds: Archives Rockdale Municipal Library, POD, SMH SMH 10 November 1897 p5; SMH 7 DEC 1903. Saywell also built the Brighton Hotel on the north west corner of the two streets. However the hotel lost its licence in 1892 due to the behaviour of its patrons. At the instigation of Arthur Aspinall, the Presbyterian Church was looking for a building suitable to establish a boarding school for the children of outback pastoralists. Thomas Saywell offered the use of the building to the Church for the establishment of The Scots College. Arthur Aspinall, a co-founder of the College, became its first principal: SMH 30 January 1893 p6; 15 December 1893 p3; 10 December 1013 p20. Suitable changes were made to the building to adapt it as a boarding school. The school remained at Brighton for about four years. Eventually the hotel was re-licensed and remained on the site until it was replaced by the Millers Brighton Hotel and later the Novotel Brighton Beach Motor Inn: TD. In 1895 Thomas Saywell decided to build a race course in Brighton. The Scots College found the race course and the distraction of the beach for its pupils unacceptable and left the area. The racecourse operated for many years: Archives Rockdale Municipal Library; SMH 25 January 1896, p12. During this period this small settlement, the New Brighton Estate, was still officially part of Rockdale even though it was known amongst the locals as \\"Brighton\\". The economic depression of the 1890s began to have a social impact on the area. As more people of few material means began to settle in the district the standard of living declined. The suburb recovered to some extent in the 1920s but it remained predominantly a working-class domain until the 1970s. 20th- century development=1900s to 1930s The \\"Brighton-le-Sands Post and Telegraph Office\\" was opened in about 1903 (1904 edition of the Sands Post Office Directory) giving the suburb its distinct name to distinguish it from Brighton in England. About this time a ferry service opened in Botany Bay. This allowed many more people to take advantage of the picnic facilities at Brighton. The ferry operated for about 20 years: Archives Rockdale Municipal Library, POD. The phrase \\"Lady Robindon's Beach\\" remained in use for many years after the name change for the suburb. Gradually the use of the name became confined to the actual sandy beach rather than to the suburb: (see editions of the Sydney Morning Herald up to 29 December 1925 and possibly beyond that date). From 1900 to 1912 Brighton was in the Commonwealth Electorate of Lang. A map of the area is given in the 1909 Electoral Roll. In 1913 the district was transferred to the electorate of Illawarra. Another map is provided in the 1915 electoral roll. It is very similar to the map of 1909. The electorate of Barton, which included Brighton-le-Sands was established in 1922. In the electoral rolls a number of abbreviations are used for the name of the suburb including: \\"B-l-S\\", \\"B.-le-S\\", \\"Br-le-S\\" and \\"Br.-le-S\\". World War I also slowed development of the suburb. In 1904 there was a meeting hall called Saywell's Concert Hall: SMH 12 DEC 1904, p5. The obituary of Samuel Cook, after whom the foreshore Cooks Park was named, appeared in the Sydney Morning Heraldon 4 July 1910 p9 After World War I, considerable expansion of the area began. Soon the residential potential of the suburb had almost tripled in size; POD. To the south of Bay Street the area west of the bay bounded by Bay Street, Crawford Road and President Avenue was developed. To the west of the New Brighton Estate Francis Lane (later known as Francis Lane Road and then Francis Avenue) was built: CER. The streets of the Estate between The Grand Parade and The Avenue north of Bay Street, as far north as Selwood Street, were extended west to reach Francis Lane. The Avenue was extended north to Bestic Street. Reading Road was constructed to its west along with Henson Street, Rowley Street and Cashman Road; see maps provided in the various electoral rolls. The district had even more expansion from the mid-1920s until the Great Depression of the early 1930s: POD. The land beside Muddy Creek at the northern end of Francis Avenue was originally a swamp. After the swamp was drained in about 1924, Francis Avenue was extended past Henson Street to Bestic Street. The reclaimed land was used for homes in Yarran Avenue, Carinya Avenue and the eastern side of Francis Avenue. Beyond Carinya Avenue there was a dairy with a live-in residence and Tasker's market garden, abutting Bestic Street. The dairy at 35 Francis Avenue was owned by James Erskine: CER, POD. The land on Bay street owned by the Francis family was sold. Francis Lane Avenue, as it was originally called, was built as far as Selwood street. Houses were constructed intermittently along its length. Later some of the land was sold to the Roman Catholic Church for the construction of St Thomas More's Church and denominational primary school. When The Avenue was continued past Selwood Street to Bestic Street it was renamed Moate Avenue: CER, POD. Several isolated shops were built in Rowley Street to cater for the daily needs of the local inhabitants of this new housing development. A butcher shop was built on the north west corner of Rowley Street and Moate Avenue. Diagonally opposite there was a general store. Both of these shops were still open in the first decade of the 21st century. Purnell's greengrocery and milk bar was located on the north side of Rowley Street between Moate Avenue and Reading Road: E. A fourth shop was built on the south west corner of The Rowley Street/Reading Road intersection. 1940s to 1970s Just as Australia began to recover from the Depression of the early 1930s, World War II started. Development of Brighton remained stagnant. After World War II, Sydney experienced a severe housing shortage. All suitable, available land was acquired for new housing. Brighton began its third major period of growth. A three hectare vacant area known locally as Archbald's Paddock extended from Henson Street to Bestic Street. It was located between Yarran Avenue, Carinya Avenue, the dairy and market gardens to the west and Rowley Street and Cashman Road to the east. Walking tracks linked these various streets. The property had once belonged to the Archbald family. Grace Archbald, the last surviving member of the family and unmarried died in 1942: [NSW BDM Index on the Internet]. The ramshackled old house soon degenerated further and was vandalised. Remnants of the foundations of some of their buildings and some of their shrubs remained east of Yarran Avenue. Also, with the advent of widespread refrigeration and bottled milk the dairy was no longer required in the region. The paddocks were sold: CER, POD, street directories. In the late 1940s the first part of Archbald's Paddock to be released for housing was that located along Henson Street. Soon afterwards the remainder of the land and the dairy paddock were amalgamated to become a housing estate. Archbald Avenue was built from Bestic Street through the centre of the former Archbald Paddock with links to all the surrounding streets. MacIntyre Avenue was constructed through the former dairy paddock between Francis Avenue and the new Archbald Avenue. People began to move into the houses of both Archbald Avenue and MacIntyre Avenue about 1952. Tasker's Market garden still operated at the corner of Bestic Street and Francis Avenue: CER, TD. On the western side of Francis Avenue housing stopped at number 64, opposite number eleven, just past Henson Street. North of number 64 was another market garden known as Hop Long's. This property extended from Bestic Street to behind the houses in Francis Avenue and across to Muddy Creek. In the late 1940s the frontage of the market garden along Francis Avenue was acquired and houses built, except for an access area to the market garden and its dwelling. In the mid-1950s this market garden was transformed into an extension of the White Oak Reserve. Eventually, about ten years later, Tasker's market garden and number 35 Francis Avenue, where the Erskines had continued to live, were also sold. This parcel of land became the site of Bilmark Place and Phillip Crescent: CER. Late 20th century to present The ethnicity and socio-economic status altered as the former residents died or left the suburb. Their houses were pulled down and replaced by the many multi- storeyed blocks of units which are now the dominant housing. The shopping centre changed considerably, to cater to the needs of the changed population. Storm damage Several times the bridge over Muddy Creek at Bestic Street was flooded to the extent of making it impassable, or even washing the bridge away. Similar problems arose for the bridge over the creek at Bay Street. The floods were particularly bad when water cascading down the hills on the two streets coincided with a high tide in the creek: Archives Rockdale Municipal Library. Wind storms would deposit sand on Grand Parade and The Esplanade making them impassable and eroding the sand dunes. Periodically wave damage would erode the beach. The worst damage to the beach occurred on 13 June 1966 (Sydney Morning Herald, 15 June 1966). Brighton-le-Sands Primary School The initial school building was located on the west side of Crawford Road between Kurnell Street and Kings Road. As the population of the suburb increased land was resumed further south on Crawford Road, between Kings Road and O'Neill Street. Here two buildings were constructed in 1916: an infants' school to cater for the first three years of schooling and the main upper primary school: CER, POD. Medical services The Pacific Private Hospital was located initially on The Esplanade. By 1930 the hospital had relocated to Queens Road. Bigger facilities were built on the south east corner of the intersection of Bay Street and West Botany Street by 1936. A private convalescent hospital, East Lynn run by Matron Maudie Shaw, opened at 13 Henson Street in the mid-1930s soon after the extension of Henson Street past Reading Road. Matron Shaw's husband was in the Royal Australian Navy: CER. Many of the patients were overseas sailors recuperating from illness or accidents. These sailors were waiting until they were well enough to return home or to rejoin their ships when the ships were next in port. By the 1950s the number of sailors needing convalescence had reduced greatly. The hospital now catered to a wider range of needs within the local population. Matron Shaw retired in the 1960s: CER, TD. By 1925 a doctors surgery had been opened on the south west corner of the intersection of Crawford Road with Bay Street: POD. Adelaide Croucher, chiropodist, conducted a business in her own home from the mid-1940s. Initially this was at 17 Francis Avenue, then later from 6 Carinya Avenue : TD. She also visited many clients in their own homes. On Wednesdays she worked at the local hairdressing salon on Bay Street. As people sat under the hairdryer they would have their feet attended to as well.

Who's who in Animated Cartoons: An International Guide to Film & Television's Award-winning and Legendary Animators, p. 265. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2006. . Accessed April 28, 2017. \\"A native of Passaic, New Jersey, Novros grew up wanting to be a painter\\" His curiosity in the study of movement lead to an interest in motion pictures. In 1936 he was recruited by the Walt Disney Company to come to Hollywood to work on feature animation projects. Novros was an \\"inbetweener\\" on the 1937 Disney animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and received a credit for art direction for the \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" sequence of Fantasia (1940). In 1941, Novros left Disney to form his own production company, Graphic Films. That same year he joined the faculty of the Cinema Department of the University of Southern California. Thousands of students took his course on \\"Filmic Expression\\" before his retirement in 1984. Graphic Films found immediate success producing training films for the military during World War II. As the United States Air Force and NASA emerged in the post war period, Graphic's expertise in animating the visual dimensions of space exploration played a key role in interesting the United States Congress and the general public in supporting the country's first forays into space. Among his many achievements, Novros may be most remembered as a pioneer in the large format and special venue film industries. Included in his filmography are numerous specialty films produced for World Fair Expositions, including several titles for the 1964 New York's World Fair, including Chemical Man for Abbott Laboratories, Reaching for the Stars, for Lockheed Corporation, and Voyage to America for the United States Pavilion. However, it was the 10-perf, 70mm film To the Moon and Beyond, (produced for Cinerama Corporation) that caught the attention of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who soon enlisted the creativity of Novros and his special effects team in the creation of A Space Odyssey (1968). Novros's interest in large format film technology led him to produce some of the first Imax/Omnimax films, for the Reuben H. Fleet Space Center in San Diego, California, including Voyage to the Outer Planets, Cosmos: the World of Loren Eisley and Tomorrow in Space (1982). In 1976 Novros won national acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for his documentary film Universe. Novros's much sought after course at USC helped young filmmakers understand the relationship of color, light, movement and form as they specifically related to the film medium. Upon his retirement from USC, he continued to assemble his lectures into a textbook. Former student and friend George Lucas penned these words for the introduction of the manuscript: \\"The first time I truly understood the unique quality of film was when I took Les Novros' class. Stressing that film is a kinetic medium, Les has kept the Eisenstienian flame burning at USC, and it is a tradition that has strongly influenced my work.\\" At the age of 91, Novros died in Sherman Oaks, California, after an extended illness.

She was attending Maryville College in Maryville, Tennessee when she married Russell Ransom Elston (1911‚Äì1975) in 1936. The couple divorced in 1960. During the 1940s and 1950s, Elston worked in the legal department at the Du Pont Company in Wilmington, Delaware.

She was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1956 and 1960, serving on the rules and platform committees. She was also a member of the Delaware Republican State Central Committee from 1954 to 1958. Considered a moderate conservative, Elston endorsed Barry Goldwater for President in 1964 but thereafter announced that she preferred Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, considered the most liberal of serious Republican candidates.

Normally the First Vice President, then conservative Phyllis Schlafly, would have been unopposed for the top position. When Schlafly sought to move up to the presidency, however, Elston worked covertly against her, and Schlafly lost to Gladys O'Donnell, a favorite of the Republican moderates, who drew the active support of Governors Nelson Rockefeller, Winthrop Rockefeller of Arkansas, and George Romney of Michigan.

He served in the Philippines attached to the 45th Infantry (Philippine Scouts), evaded capture in the spring of 1942, and organized a guerrilla regiment in the Central Plains of the northern island of Luzon. He was promoted to major by war's end, age 28, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by General Douglas MacArthur. Lapham was the third person, after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and MacArthur, to receive the Philippine Legion of Honor. Biography=Early life A graduate of the University of Iowa in 1939 with an ROTC 2nd lieutenant's commission in the Army Reserve, Lapham worked for the Chicago branch of the Burroughs Corporation before signing up for active duty in May 1941.Lapham, R., and Norling, B., 1996, Lapham's Raiders, Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, He was assigned to the Philippines and arrived Manila on June 25, 1941, and stationed at Fort William McKinley. Bataan After MacArthur was evacuated to Australia, General Jonathan Wainwright was given command of the Philippine defense force. As talk of surrender began, Lapham sneaked through the lines. In his 1996 book, Lapham‚Äôs Raiders: Guerrillas in the Philippines, 1942‚Äì45, he explained why he headed to the jungles to fight: \\"Somehow, I didn‚Äôt like the idea of surrendering. I felt I had better chances on the outside than in a Japanese prison camp.\\" Lapham joined Major Claude A. Thorp in organizing \\"a raiding party that would slip through Japanese lines\\", sabotage Clark Field and gather intelligence for General MacArthur. On January 27, 1942, they passed through Japanese lines into the Zambales Mountains, finally reaching Mount Pinatubo, where they established Camp Four or Camp Sanchez, and the newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel Thorp established radio communication with Bataan. After the fall of Bataan, Thorp released his approximately one hundred men from following his orders, allowing them to surrender, stay or follow their own path. Lapham and Sergeants Albert Short and Esteban Lumyeb, started north, eventually making it to Lupao, Nueva Ecija, where they were joined by Sergeant Estipona and other soldiers. Lapham went on to establish another camp in Umingan, Pangasinan. By May 1942, he had a company of men in both locations, and his Luzon Guerrilla Army Force (LGAF) would dominate the northern Luzon central plain. According to Lapham, \\"Most of the guerrilla leaders who died in the war were killed or captured in its first year...\\", while the rest, \\"...had managed to eliminate or chase off spies and collaborators...learned how to win the support and trust of civilians...had succeeded in establishing effective spy systems of our own...had learned when to hide out and when to show ourselves...\\" Luzon Guerrilla Philippine historical marker for Dalton Pass and the role of Lapham's LGAF in the battle In 1943 and 1944, the estimated 13,000 Filipinos under Lapham's command in the Luzon Guerrilla Armed Forces (LGAF), engaged in \\"harassing the Japanese more than they had in 1942. This included 38 squadrons in Nueva Ecija under Captain Harry McKenzie, 15 in Pangasinan under Captain Ray C. Hunt, and six in Tarlac under Captain Al Hendrickson. He also had coast watcher units at Baler Bay, Caranglan and Pantabangan, and a combat unit of southwest Pampanga under the command of Emilio and Tony Hernandez. Lapham also managed to evacuate Captain Wilbur Lage and other Americans to Australia via submarine. In mid-1944, he received radio transmitters and started sending intelligence information to Australia. This was followed by 30 tons of supplies from the in August 1944, and another 20 tons from the in Oct. On January 4, 1945, his forces initiated four days of sabotage in support of the Battle of Luzon. On January 8, Lapham linked up with General Walter Krueger's US 6th Army. Lapham then formed the 1st Infantry Regiment, which was attached to the 25th Division on January 20. The Japanese army put a $1 million bounty on his head. Lapham is credited for bringing the perilous situation of the 513 Allied POWs and internees remaining in the Cabanatuan Japanese POW camp to the attention of the American forces then fighting their way across Luzon towards Manila in January 1945. The POWs, captured after the fall of Corregidor and Bataan in 1942, had not been shipped to Japan because they were considered too ill or unfit. Lapham's was concerned the POWs would be executed before the camp could be liberated. His concerns were well justified given the August 1944 Japanese War Ministry directive to commandants of POW camps outlining the final disposition of prisoners (known as the \\"August 1 Kill-All Order\\"), and the killing of 139 American POWs by the Japanese at Palawan, Philippines on 14 December 1944. Lapham's efforts lead to a rescue mission on January 30, 1945, by 121 members of the US Army's 6th Ranger Battalion, and two teams of Alamo Scouts, who marched behind enemy lines, eliminated the Japanese forces securing the camp, liberated its 513 prisoners and returned them to American lines. By May 31, 1945, Lapham had 79 squadrons, 809 officers and 13,382 men, who suffered 813 casualties. After the war Lapham returned to Burroughs (now Unisys) after the war. In 1975, he retired as vice president for industrial relations, in Detroit.

It is used as a biochemical tool in the study of TRPV ion channels. Pharmacology Capsazepine blocks the painful sensation of heat caused by capsaicin (the active ingredient of chilli pepper) which activates the TRPV1 ion channel. Capsazepine is therefore considered to be a TRPV1 antagonist. The TRPV1 channel functions as a pain and temperature sensor in mammalians. Capsazepine blocks the activation of TRPV1 channels by other chemicals, but not by other painful stimuli such as heat. Depending on the pharmacological assay, the IC50 is in the nanomolar to low micromolar range. In addition to its effects on TRPV1 channels, it was also shown to activate the noxious chemical sensor TRPA1 channel, inhibit the cold activated TRPM8 channel, voltage-activated calcium channels and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It mainly serves as a tool to study the TRPV1 ion channel. Development Capsazepine was discovered by a research group working for Novartis.

In addition, WMIT is heard on translator station W234CF (94.7 FM) in Boone, North Carolina, and most of WMIT's schedule is simulcast on WFGW in the Knoxville, Tennessee, radio market. \\"Superpower\\" Coverage WMIT has one of the largest coverage areas for an FM radio station in the Eastern United States. Its signal can be heard in the Tri-Cities of Tennessee (where it provides city-grade coverage), Greenville/Spartanburg, Charlotte and its hometown of Asheville. Recently, the station has begun identifying as \\"WMIT, Black Mountain-Charlotte-Asheville,\\" acknowledging its large following in the Charlotte area. All told, WMIT claims a potential audience of five million people in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia. This is because its transmitter is located on Clingman's Peak, with the combined mountain and transmitter tower elevation at over above sea level, with the highest transmitter site east of the Mississippi River. Its effective radiated power (ERP) is 36,000 watts, while many FM stations nearby run at 100,000 watts, but their towers are only a third the height of WMIT. Due to its unusual height above average terrain (HAAT), WMIT is grandfathered with a \\"superpower\\" signal.\\"The History of American Broadcasting\\" by Jeff Miller. Retrieved 2018-08-20 History In the summer of 1941, Mount Mitchell Broadcasters signed on W41MM, with 50,000 watts, on 44.1 MHz, within the old FM band. It is the oldest FM station in North Carolina and among the earliest FM stations in U.S. The station's transmitter was above sea level. Originally licensed to Winston-Salem, away, the station operated by remote telephone line. The Winston-Salem studios were eventually housed in a two-story building built in 1942 at 419 Spruce Street by the Winston-Salem Journal and The Twin City Sentinel for their AM station WSJS. W41MM became WMIT, and moved to 97.3, when the FM dial moved to 88-108 MHz. Sometime before 1950, WMIT switched to 106.9 MHz and relocated its studios and city of license to Charlotte.Broadcasting Magazine 1957 page 194 Its transmitter rises above Clingman's Peak, putting WMIT tower's light higher than anything else east of the Mississippi. The station's call letters stand for Mount Mitchell, the highest mountain east of the Mississippi River, located about 2¬Ω miles northeast of the station's transmitter. The two-story building housing the transmitter equipment included living space for station engineers needing to stay during difficult winter weather when the road to the top might be impassable. Diesel engines powered the station at first, but eventually power lines were installed. Gordon Gray had to close the station in Spring 1950 because he did not have the time to run it. When the station returned to the air in 1951, its power was the equivalent of 325,000 watts. WMIT could be picked up in Atlanta, Georgia, away. Six and a half million potential listeners could receive the signal. Studios were in Charlotte, away, and programming was delivered by means of an STL. Much of the music was classical or beautiful music, though three hours a day of local, regional music was played due to listener interest.http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ggninfo/15.htm, Retrieved on 2008/08/14. Billy Graham's ministry purchased WMIT in 1962. At first Graham used the station to broadcast Christian instructional and preaching programs, hosted by Graham and other religious leaders. But around 2000, the station shifted its focus to airing a music-oriented Christian contemporary format, with some instructional and preaching programs during the day.

The show was made at the National Studios in Elstree. The outdoor scenes were filmed around the mountains and lakes of Snowdonia in Wales. The film base and make-up were at a small farm in Cwm y Glo in Snowdonia. This is beside Llyn Padarn, a lake which can be seen in many shots (as can cars on the A4086 road on the opposite side of the lake!). The crew used to walk up the mountain from their base as there was no vehicle access, and brought work for at least three yearly shoots to a tiny corner of North Wales before tourism took off. An accident early occurred to the star, Conrad Phillips, during filming in Snowdonia. He was asked to keep stepping back until he stepped off a 12-foot drop, injuring his knee ‚Äì which eventually led to his retirement from acting. Phillips had to wear support bandages during filming but sometimes forgot, causing him to struggle with some action scenes. Daily rushes were viewed at the only cinema in the area, at Llanberis, which was taken over from 8.00 until noon every morning. The film was taken to Soho in London for developing and the rushes returned to Llanberis by 8.30 next morning. Although all three series had location scenes, the third was more studio based and location scenes were mostly taken from unused and reused stock shots from the first and second series. A smaller crew went to Wales for this series and more money was saved by shooting without synchronised sound. In the days of enforced demarcation, this saved several technicians' wages. Though in some ways the same as The Adventures of Robin Hood, a brave bowman fighting against a tyrant, this was a harder show with crossbow bolts killing people and Tell fighting hand-to-hand, which often resulted in the death of the bad guy. Unlike the courtly Sheriff of Nottingham, Gessler was a pig of a man, unshaven, often eating or drinking without manners and throwing his metaphorical as well as literal weight around. The series was repeated well into the 1960s. In June 2020 the series began a rerun on the British Talking Pictures TV channel. Music The series featured a long-remembered theme song, with music based on the William Tell Overture by Gioachino Rossini. For the show, the song lyrics were by Harold Purcell and were sung by David Whitfield. Because this portion of Rossini's overture was the theme of The Lone Ranger in the United States, a different portion of the overture, with lyrics added, became the theme song there, titled: The Freedom Song ‚Äì \\"Marching Behind William Tell\\" by Geoffrey Parsons. This is on The Network DVD episode Castle of Fear. Incidental music was by Albert Elms and Sydney John Kay. Lyrics 1\\\\. Come away, come away with William Tell, Come away to the land he loved so well; What a day, what a day when the apple fell, For Tell and Switzerland 2\\\\. Come away with Tell to the mountainside Look down to the pass where the tyrants ride. Fit a bolt to your bow and down they go, For Tell and Switzerland 3\\\\. We are simple peasant folk We will not bear a foreign yoke Our freedom song will echo on To fight for what is right. 4\\\\. Hurry on, hurry on, there's a dungeon cell; Hurry on, hurry on, there's a noose as well; But we'll escape from the jaws of hell For Tell and Switzerland. 5\\\\. We lived our lives, we loved our friends, We never wanted more. We had the skill to plough and till, But not the art of war, But now the tyrant from the plains Steals up to take our lands, Instead of spade we wield the blade Our life is in our hands. 6\\\\. Follow on, follow on, at the leader's heel With a thrust of a pike and a clash of steel Follow on with the fight till the tyrants reel For Tell and Switzerland. 7\\\\. Give 'em one for the day they burned the grain, Give 'em two for the night that Fritz was slain, Give 'em three, give 'em four and hooray for more, For Tell and Switzerland. 8\\\\. The shepherd's crook, the reaping hook Has taken on a warlike look. With blades we've beaten from the plough We'll reap a harvest now. 9\\\\.

The rulers of Raj Darbhanga were Maithil Brahmins and their seat in the town of Darbhanga became the core of the Mithila region as the rulers were patrons of Maithil culture and the Maithili language. The dynasty emerged after the fall of the Oiniwar Dynasty. Main Gate of Darbhanga Fort History The Khandaval dynasty was one of many Brahmin dynasties to rule in India, doing so in the Mithila/Tirhut region from the time of the Mughal emperor Akbar until the 1960s. They became known as the Raj Darbhanga. The extent of their lands, which were not contiguous, varied over time, and their area of ownership was smaller than the area that they were granted under sanad arrangements. A particularly significant reduction occurred when the influence of the British Raj caused them to lose control of the territories that were in Nepal but, nonetheless, their holdings were considerable. One estimate suggests that when their rule came to an end, the territories comprised around , with around 4500 villages. Formation The area that now comprises the northern part of the Indian state of Bihar was under a state of lawlessness at the end of the empire of the Tughlaq Dynasty. Tughlaq had attacked and taken control of Bihar, and from the end of the Tughlaq Dynasty until the establishment of the Mughal Empire in 1526 there was anarchy and chaos in the region. Akbar (ruled 1556‚Äì1605) realised that taxes from Mithila could only be collected if there was a king who could ensure peace there. The Brahmins were dominant in the Mithila region and Mithila had Brahmin kings in the past. Akbar summoned Rajpandit Chandrapati Thakur to Delhi and asked him to name one of his sons who could be made caretaker and tax collector for his lands in Mithila. Chandrapati Thakur named his middle son, Mahesh Thakur, and Akbar declared Mahesh Thakur as the caretaker of Mithila on the day of Ram Navami in 1557 AD. The Raj Darbhanga used its military to help the Nawabs in suppressing rebellions from Bettiah, the chieftains of the Terai and Banjaras. The first king of this dynasty helped Mughals to uproot Oiniwar dynasty from Mithila. The Raj Darbhanga also made the Sena chiefs of Makwanpur in Nepal their subordinates with the Sena's having to pay tribute to the Rajas of Darbhanga. Consolidation The family and descendants of Mahesh Thakur gradually consolidated their power in social, agrarian, and political matters and came to be regarded as kings of Madhubani. Darbhanga became the seat of power of the Raj Darbhanga family from 1762. They also had a palace at Rajnagar Bihar situated in Madhubani district. They bought land from local people. They became known as a Khandavala family (the richest landlord). For a period of twenty years (1860‚Äì1880), Darbhanga Raj was placed under the Court of Wards by the British Raj. During this period, Darbhanga Raj was involved in litigation regarding succession. This litigation decided that the estate was impartible and succession was to be governed by primogeniture. Zamindari estates in the region, including Darbhanga, actually sought intervention of the Court of Wards from time to time because the stewardship of the British authorities, who invested funds wisely, had a tendency to boost their economic position. The estate had in any event been badly run prior to this time: a complex system influenced by both nepotism and sycophancy had dramatically affected the family's rental income. The bureaucratic system introduced by the Court, whose appointed officials had no ties to the area, resolved the issue although, being focussed entirely on what was best for the owners, it did so without considering the consequences for the tenants. Towards the end of the 19th century, 47 percent of the cropped area of the Darbhanga estate was used for the cultivation of rice. Three percent of total cultivation was given over to indigo at that time, making the estate one of the most important centres in the region for this crop prior to the introduction of chemical dyes. Demise After the independence of India from British rule in 1947, the Government of India initiated several land reform actions and the Zamindari system was abolished. The fortunes of Darbhanga Raj dwindled. The last ruler of Raj Darbhanga was Maharaja Bahadur Sir Kameshwar Singh. He died in 1962 without naming a successor. Controversy over royal status The origin of the royal family of Darbhanga is traced to a grant of the Sarkar of Tirhut to Mahesh Thakur by Akbar. The supporters of the theory that Raj Darbhanga was a kingdom argue that it was held by privy council, that the rulership was a hereditary one with succession governed by primogeniture. The supporters argue that by the end of the 18th century, the Sarkar of Tirhut was practically an independent kingdom until the conquest of Bengal and Bihar by the British.Jnanendra Nath Kumar ‚Äì The Genealogical History of India The opponents of the theory argue that Raj Darbhanga was never a kingdom but rather a zamindari with all the trappings of princely state. The rulers of Raj Darbhanga were the largest landowners in India, and thus were called Raja, and later Maharaja and Maharajadhiraja. They were given the status of ruling prince.Lakshmana Jha ‚Äì Mithila: A Union Republic Further, after conquest of Bengal and Bihar, the British Raj initiated the Permanent Settlement, and the Raja of Darbhanga was recognised only as a Zamindar. Raj Darbhanga also paid yearly lagan (land tax) to old existing Zamindar of Darbhanga, Kachari at Khan Sahib ki deaorhi. Rulers * Raja Mahesh Thakur (died 1558). * Raja Gopal Thakur.

It is located between the campuses of the Notre Dame of Maryland University and Loyola College. It, along with Homewood Museum, make up the Johns Hopkins University Museums. History The mansion was built in the mid-19th century and bought in 1878 by the president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, John W. Garrett. Railroads were then a key industry in the United States and, as Baltimore's Garrett family owned and managed one of the biggest rail companies, the home grew and became both luxurious and famous. John Garrett's son T. Harrison added a wing containing a billiard room, bowling alley, and a gymnasium, which in later years were converted into an art gallery and private theater. Evergreen served as a home for the family until 1952, when it was donated to the university. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Architecture The house, a magnificent example of Gilded Age architecture, sits on a landscaped site in Northern Baltimore and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The initial design was a more modest Italianate house but, with the Garretts, it became a 48-room mansion with a 23-karat gold plated bathroom, a 30,000-book library, and a theatre painted by famous Russian artist L√©on Bakst. The abundant decorative items in the house reflect the Garretts' travels and interests, including a red Asian room displaying Japanese and Chinese items, works by Picasso, Modigliani, and Degas, glass by Tiffany or Dutch marquetry. Today, the university manages the museum and offers guided tours. Library Late 15th century Dutch book of hours from the John Work Garrett Library The John Work Garrett Library is under the aegis of the Department of Special Collections at the Johns Hopkins University. The collection totals over 30,000 volumes, the majority of which were collected by John Work Garrett (1872‚Äì1942) and his father, T. Harrison Garrett (1849‚Äì1888). The collection is especially strong in literature of the English Renaissance, including the Shakespeare Folios of 1623, 1632, and 1663. Other collection strengths include natural history, such as the original pattern plates for James Sowerby's Mineral Conchology of Great Britain, travel literature, architecture, and early Americana, such as the manuscript of The History of the Ancient and Honorable Tuesday Club by Alexander Hamilton. It also has a small but choice collection of incunabula and books of hours.

Ankhhaf is thought to have been involved with the building of the Great Pyramid of Giza and likely played a role in the construction of the Sphinx . In 2013 a collection of papyri fragments, the Diary of Merer, was discovered at the ancient Harbor of Khufu at Wadi al-Jarf. The logs from an inspector named Merer appear to date from the 27th year of Khufu's reign and record months worth of operations transporting limestone from Tura to Giza. The records refer to an administrative center named Ro-She Khufu which was under the authority of the Vizier Ankhhaf. According to Egyptologist Pierre Tallet, this would place him in charge of the construction of the pyramid towards the end of the project. Though the diary does not specify, Tallet believes the operations refer to the delivery of the Tura limestone used for the casing.Tallet, Pierre and Marouard, Gregory, The Harbor of Khufu on the Red Sea Coast at Wadi al-Jarf, Egypt, Journal of Near Eastern Archaeology, 77:1, 2014, pp 8-12 In the papyrus he Ankhkhaf is called nobleman (iry-pat) and overseer of Ra-shi-Khufu.

A member of the Republican Party, Schlozman was appointed by Gonzales as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, replacing Todd Graves, and he assumed that office on March 23, 2006. In April 2007, Schlozman left the U.S. Attorney position to work at the Executive Office for United States Attorneys. Schlozman and his office came under review by Congressional and Senate investigators regarding the dismissal of U.S. Attorneys and alleged inappropriate politicization of the Civil Rights Division.On Jan. 13, 2009, a report by the Department of Justice alleged that Schlozman repeatedly violated federal law in politicizing the Civil Rights Division. Letter from Sen. Patrick Leahy to Bradley Schlozman , May 7, 2007 The Department of Justice Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility alleged that Schlozman had violated the law and made false statements to Congress about his hiring decisions. While Schlozman testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that his personnel decisions were not based on party affiliation, the report cited emails and other communications in which Schlozman discussed hiring \\"right-thinking Americans\\" and ridding the Civil Rights Division of \\"pinkos\\", \\"commies\\", and attorneys perceived to be unacceptably liberal. Federal prosecutors, however, declined to file charges of criminal perjury against Schlozman, drawing criticism from Senate Democrats. Schlozman resigned from the Department of Justice on August 17, 2007, and accepted a position with the Hinkle Law Firm in Wichita, Kansas. Education, early career, and family A native of Overland Park, Kansas, Schlozman graduated from Shawnee Mission South High School in Overland Park, Kansas before receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and graduating magna cum laude with special distinction from The University of Pennsylvania. He obtained his Juris Doctor from The George Washington University Law School, graduating with honors. While at law school, Schlozman served as a legal intern in the United States Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Western District of Missouri. Schlozman served a two-year federal judicial clerkship with Chief U.S. District Judge G. Thomas VanBebber of the District of Kansas. He then spent a year clerking for U.S. Circuit Judge Mary Beck Briscoe of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In 1999, Schlozman moved to Washington, D.C., where he joined the Supreme Court and Appellate Litigation Practice at Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White, before moving on to the Department of Justice in November 2001. Schlozman began service in the George W. Bush Administration as Counsel to then-Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson. He then served in various roles including Deputy Assistant Attorney General directly supervising the Criminal, Voting, Employment, and Special Litigation Sections of the Civil Rights Division, five months as Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division, and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division at the United States Department of Justice. Following his tenure in the Civil Rights Division, Schlozman was appointed the interim U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri. Personnel controversy In June 2007, Schlozman was questioned by Democrats on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegedly inappropriate politicized hiring policies during his tenure in the Civil Rights Division, charges which Schlozman denied. The Department of Justice's Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility subsequently conducted an investigation and issued a report on Jan. 13, 2009, concluding that Schlozman violated the Civil Service Reform Act by hiring attorneys on the basis of their political affiliation and later made false statements in his sworn testimony to Congress about his hiring decisions. Federal prosecutors later declined to prosecute Schlozman.

As required by the Voting Rights Act, \\"Georgia and other states with a history of voter discrimination\\" (mostly southern states) are required to show that law changes will not have a discriminatory impact on minority voters, and to get approval by the Department of Justice under 1965 Voting Rights Act According to rumors reported in the press, all of the staff of the Civil Rights division of DOJ, save one, recommended against the new law's approval, but Schlozman and other political appointees overruled the staff and approved it. The law was initially held unconstitutional as against the Georgia state constitution, but that ruling was reversed by a unanimous decision of the Georgia Supreme Court.Lake v Perdue , September 19, 2006 In federal court, U.S. District Judge Harold L. Murphy issued an injunction against the law, holding that it was constitutionally suspect but declining to consider whether it offended the Voting Rights Act. Subsequent to the federal court decision, Schlozman wrote an op-ed in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution defending the Department of Justice's decision to pre-clear the Voter ID law under the Voting Rights Act. Although the Justice Department's actions were heavily criticized by liberal groups, no court has ever held that the Georgia ID law runs afoul of the Voting Rights Act, the only statutory provision considered by the DOJ in issuing its approval of the law. In fact, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the law against all constitutional challenges. =Texas redistricting = In 2003, Tom DeLay spearheaded a major redistricting plan for the state of Texas. Justice Department lawyers wrote a memo opposing the plan, concluding that the it violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The memo was endorsed unanimously by lawyers and analysts from the Department's Voting section. Nevertheless, Schlozman and several other political appointees overruled the lawyers' objections and approved DeLay's plan. In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, the Supreme Court issued a complex 100-plus page concluding that all but one of the thirty-two district in the Texas redistricting plan satisfied the requirements of the Voting Rights Act. =Lawsuit against Missouri= In 2005, while Schlozman was serving in the Civil Rights Division, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against Missouri accusing the state of failing to make a \\"reasonable effort\\" to eliminate ineligible people from voter rolls and improperly removing certain voters from the voter rolls prematurely. Although the then-US Attorney for Missouri, Todd Graves, whom Schlozman later succeeded after Graves' forced resignation, claims to have refused to sign off on the lawsuit, the Complaint filed in the case was signed by both Graves and an Assistant U.S. Attorney from his office, in addition to Schlozman and Assistant Attorney General Wan J. Kim. On April 13, 2007, a federal district judge dismissed the lawsuit, asserting that the Secretary of State couldn't police local registration rolls. The Justice Department appealed that ruling, however, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit later reversed the district court's decision. In March 2009, after a new political leadership had been installed at the Justice Department in the wake of the presidential election, the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, essentially ending the case and dropping all charges.  Missouri Western District Dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy = The forced resignation of U.S. Attorney Todd Graves and subsequent appointment of Schlozman is part of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, which concerns the replacement of a number of U.S. Attorneys by the George W. Bush administration in its second term. =ACORN voter registration prosecutions= In addition to the complaints regarding the lawsuit against the State of Missouri, described above, attention has focused on his lawsuit against several former employees of the activist group ACORN. In the summer of 2006, ACORN \\"paid workers $8 an hour to sign up new voters in poor neighborhoods around the country. Later, ACORN's Kansas City chapter discovered that several workers filled out registration forms fraudulently instead of finding real people to sign up. ACORN fired the workers and alerted law enforcement.\\" Just five days before the 2006 election, Schlozman announced the indictments of four of the former ACORN workers, who all ultimately pleaded guilty to the voter registration charges. The election featured an extremely close Senate race between the incumbent Jim Talent and eventual winner Claire McCaskill. Former U.S. Attorneys Todd Graves and David Iglesias, expressed surprise at the indictments, claiming that they appeared to violate longstanding Department of Justice policy to avoid overtly politically related prosecutions during an election. Joseph D. Rich, a 35-year veteran of the Department of Justice and chief of its voting section from 1999 to 2005, wrote a Los Angeles Times op-ed criticizing the prosecutions as politically motivated. Schlozman testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 5, 2007. Responding to concerns about a possible political motivation for pushing forward with prosecution immediately before the 2006 election, Schlozman stated that the department's public integrity officials had approved the prosecution and that he \\"did not think it was going to affect the election at all.\\" However, he later amended his testimony, indicating that he had not been \\"directed\\" to indict for voter fraud, days before the November 2006 election in question, but that Schlozman himself made the decision to indict, after his First Assistant U.S. Attorney had consulted with the Washington DOJ Election Crimes Branch. Letter from Bradley J. Schlozman addressed to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dated June 11, 2007. According to Schlozman, Department of Justice policy‚Äîas explicitly underscored by the director of the Department's Elections Crimes Branch‚Äîwas that the prosecution of ACORN employees for criminal voting offenses was not improper because the prosecutions pertained to \\"... voter registration fraud (which examined conduct during voter registration), not fraud during an ongoing or contested election.\\" =Jackson County Executive Katheryn Shields= In January 2007, Schlozman's office indicted Democratic Jackson County Executive Katheryn Shields, who had just left office, on charges of wire fraud in connection with a scheme for an appraiser to fraudulently inflate the price of her home that she was selling. Shields asked the court to dismiss the charges on the basis that they were politically motivated, but the court refused to order disclosure of internal Justice Department documentation and rejected her argument. The day after the indictment, Shields filed for an ultimately unsuccessful run for Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri. She was subsequently acquitted in the criminal case although her co-defendants‚Äîthe appraiser and the appraiser's associates‚Äîwere convicted. Shields then sued the government to recover $202,000 in legal fees. However the court concluded that \\"[t]here is no evidence that the prosecutors in this matter acted with maliciousness or with an intent to harass, annoy, or embarrass [Shields] nor that the evidence was objectively deficient.\\".

Basis of the chart \\"Fab\\" (short for \\"fabulous\\") was a very fashionable adjective in the mid-1960s, associated with the Beatles, who were known as the \\"Fab Four\\", and much used by such trend-setters as Cathy McGowan, who presented the weekly rock music show Ready Steady Go! on independent television. Unlike the charts published in the Melody Maker, New Musical Express and other music papers (or, for that matter, used by the BBC or the rival pirate station Radio Caroline Caroline's sales based top 50 was generally known as the \\"Caroline Countdown\\" .), the Fab 40 was not based on sales of records. Thus, although it mostly contained what was current and popular, it was often ahead of movements in the authentic charts and was subject to more dramatic fluctuations. Whereas, in the sales charts of the 1960s, many records would climb in stages and then drop gradually, a record might suddenly emerge near the top of the Fab 40 one week and disappear from it the next. Equally, there was often room for records to scale the higher echelons of the Fab 40 without entering the sales charts at all (for example, the Settlers' Nowhere Man in March 1966 Radio London - Big L Fab Forty 20 March 1966). As a result, a number of records that are well remembered from the mid-1960s were not, in fact, particularly successful in commercial terms. Fab 40 show The Fab 40 was unveiled each week during a three-hour programme at lunchtime on Sunday (11am to 2pm), which, through such programmes as Family Favourites and Beyond Our Ken, the BBC had established as a prime time for radio listening. The show, which followed the Colgate-Palmolive Request Hour, was presented by the station's disc jockeys on a rotational basis. This format largely mirrored that of the BBC's Pick of the Pops, which Alan Freeman had presented each Sunday on the Light Programme since 1961.Pick of the Pops was first broadcast in 1955. The final Fab 40 show was introduced by Tommy Vance on 6 August 1967, the number one record that week being the Beach Boys' Heroes and Villains, which entered the chart in the top position The final show overran by 22 minutes. (whereas, in terms of sales, it entered the British top 20 a month later and reached no higher than number eight Charlie Gillett & Simon Frith (1976) Rock File 4). Radio London closed on 14 August 1967 following enactment of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act that, in effect, outlawed such stations. In August 2007 the final \\"Fab 40\\" was re- presented by former Radio London disc jockey Dave Cash as part of a celebration on BBC Radio Essex to mark the fortieth anniversary of the pirates' demise. When the BBC opened its own \\"pop\\" station Radio One in September 1967, its sales-based top 30 chart was known informally for a time as the \\"Fun 30\\",For example, the Tony Blackburn Show (known formally as Daily Disc Delivery), Radio 1, 30 September 1967 no doubt in imitation of London's \\"Fab 40\\". Reconstructing the Fab 40 Some 30‚Äì40 years after they were in use, meticulous attempts were made to reconstruct the Fab 40 charts by Radio London Ltd. These drew on surviving lists prepared between 1965 and 1967, at Radio London's offices at 17 Curzon Street in London and informal ones compiled at the time by listeners, although there were sometimes discrepancies between the \\"official\\" list and the records that were actually delivered to the ship, the MV Galaxy.Radio London - complete Fab Forty Index intro Complete charts are available on the Radio London website, from 24 January 1965, five weeks after the station opened, till the final Fab 40, 6 August 1967 and are regularly updated with new information and input from featured artists.

History The development of capsaicin bear spray took place in the mid 1980s under principal investigator Carrie Hunt, a University of Montana graduate student working under the supervision of Dr. Charles Jonkel and Dr. Bart O‚ÄôGara. Hunt had identified commercial pepper sprays as an effective but unreliable deterrent for bears in previous research; in addition, they required close proximity. Hunt's thesis was published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984. Bill Pounds, who eventually founded Counter Assault bear spray, assisted Hunt and offered to help devise a prototype for a reliable aerosol bear spray canister for Hunt's research. They developed a bear spray formula with a spray range of over 30 feet and a spray time of over 7 seconds. Pounds played an important part in developing the ingredients, the dispersal system, and the recommended specifications of bear spray. The company he founded, Counter Assault, became the first Environmental Protection Agency registered aerosol bear spray. Use Bear spray contains 1-2% capsaicin and related capsaicinoids, the key active ingredients. Bear spray is intended to be used to deter an aggressive or charging bear. A user points the canister at an aggressive bear and sprays the contents for 2‚Äì3 seconds. Effective distance will vary depending on the manufacturer of the spray, but sprays are reported to be effective when sprayed at a charging or aggressive bear from a distance of . Effectiveness Bear spray is a very effective deterrent when used properly. In a 2008 review of bear attacks in Alaska from 1985‚Äì2006, Smith et al. found that bear spray stopped a bear's \\"undesirable behavior\\" in 92% of cases. Further, 98% of persons using bear spray in close-range encounters escaped uninjured. The efficacy of bear spray depends on the situation and circumstances of the attack. In the 2008 study, Tom Smith of Brigham Young University reported, ‚ÄúNo bear spray has ever been reported to kill a bear. It is our belief that widespread use of bear spray will promote human safety and bear conservation.‚Äù On the other hand, latent spray (on object) has also led to the attraction of bears, which usually end up with the bear destroying the spray-covered object. A United States Geological Survey article, \\"Bear Spray Safety Program,\\" says that bear spray is effective in fending off aggressive bears while also preventing injury to both the human and the bear. It also states, \\"No deterrent is 100-percent effective.\\" In \\"Living with Grizzlies,\\" the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service states, ‚ÄúThe Service supports the pepper spray policy of the Interagency Grizzly bear Committee, which states that bear spray is not a substitute for following proper bear avoidance safety techniques, and that bear spray should be used as a deterrent only in an aggressive or attacking confrontation with a bear.‚Äù ;Studies Studies suggest that bear spray is effective at reducing the risk of injury or death in these situations. While bear spray can be effective, authorities stress that proper bear-awareness and avoidance techniques are the best ways to minimize injuries due to human‚Äìbear conflict. A 2008 \\"Efficacy of Bear Deterrent Spray in Alaska\\" study stated: * \\"Red pepper spray stopped bears‚Äô undesirable behavior 92% of the time when used on brown bears, 90% for black bears, and 100% for polar bears. * Of all persons carrying sprays, 98% were uninjured by bears in close-range encounters. * All bear-inflicted injuries (n = 3) associated with defensive spraying involved brown bears and were relatively minor (i.e., no hospitalization required). * In 7% (5 of 71) of bear spray incidents, wind was reported to have interfered with spray accuracy, although it reached the bear in all cases. * In 14% (10 of 71) of bear spray incidents, users reported the spray having had negative side effects upon themselves, ranging from minor irritation (11%, 8 of 71) to near incapacitation (3%, 2 of 71). * Bear spray represents an effective alternative to lethal force and should be considered as an option for personal safety for those recreating and working in bear country.\\" It should be understood, however, that the absolute risk from bears ‚Äî even in grizzly (brown bear) country ‚Äî is so low that bear spray cannot much decrease that risk.

Bear spray is legal across the United States. It can be purchased even in Hawaii, New York, or Massachusetts, where standard pepper sprays are illegal unless bought locally by certified firearms dealers or pharmacists. In Canada, while legal for use against bears, bear spray is a prohibited weapon if intended to be used against humans. While bear spray is illegal in some U.S. National Parks, visitors to the backcountry areas of Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks are encouraged to carry it. However the Alaska National Park Service website notes that \\"Most people who hike in Alaska's wilderness don't carry a weapon. They know that the best defense is common sense. Traveling and camping carefully are all that they need.\\"http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/safety/bears.htm Bear sprays are considered a pesticide in the US and must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency.

It is mostly residential and partly industrial, with some common land and wooded areas. Tile Hill railway station is located on the West Coast Main Line which links Coventry with London and Birmingham, and is situated at the southwestern border with the city's Canley district and the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull. Geography Tile Hill is seated in the ancient Forest of Arden, and some remnants of the forest remain between the built up areas. Tile Hill Lane is flanked by Plants Hill Wood to the south and Pig Wood to the north. It is bounded by the districts of Lime Tree Park (to the east), Eastern Green (to the north) and Canley (to the south). Tile Hill Lane approximately divides the suburb into a northern and a southern section. Tile Hill has three main neighbourhoods, though none are indicated on local road signage :- *Tile Hill North which primarily consists of postwar state housing, extends to Broad Lane in the north, beyond Banner Lane to the west, and to Tile Hill Lane in the south. *Tile Hill South which comprises mainly private residences extends from Tile Hill Lane in the north, to the railway line in the south. *Tile Hill Village which is the more prosperous area and provides the main gateway into Coventry and out towards Burton Green (Warwickshire) and Solihull Borough, at the city's western extremity. The Tanyard Farm area was built in the early-1980s and is an extension of Tile Hill Village to the north, and to the west of Banner Lane towards Eastern Green. Education There were two secondary schools in Tile Hill: Woodlands Academy, a boys' comprehensive school and sports college, and Tile Hill Wood School, a girls' comprehensive school and Language college. These schools merged onto the Tile Hill Wood site in 2016, and the combined school was renamed West Coventry Academy in 2017. Primary and junior schools in Tile Hill include Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Junior School, Leigh Church of England Junior School, Limbrick Wood Primary School, whilst Templars Junior School has been replaced by housing and resited. Hereward College was a further education college for students with disabilities of various kinds. City College (formerly Tile Hill College before merger with Coventry Technical College in 2002), was adjacent to Hereward College. The college buildings have since been demolished and City College Coventry has relocated to a new purpose-built campus close to Swanswell Pool, near Coventry city centre. Local landmarks Some of the notable landmarks in the Tile Hill area include: *Site of the former Massey Ferguson/AGCO factory, offices and social club which closed in 2003. The 16-storey 1970s Massey Ferguson office tower was demolished on 8 July 2012. The former factory buildings have been demolished to make way for a mixed-use development with housing and a science and technology park containing small industrial units.Planning application brief *The new Tile Hill Library, One Stop Shop and Neighbourhood Management Centre opened by The Deputy Lord Mayor of Coventry Councillor Jack Harrison MBE JP with the cutting of a ceremonial cake on Friday 23 May 2008. *Pig Wood. *Limbrick Wood. *Plants Hill Wood. *Tile Hill Wood and nature reserve. *Maxims Casino. *\\"The Ponderosa\\", the local name of a small park, named after the ranch on the Bonanza TV series being broadcast at the time the park was made. *The \\"Banana\\" flats on Jardine Crescent. *Our Lady of the Assumption Roman Catholic Church. *St.Oswalds Anglican Church. *St.James C Of E Church *Limbrick Wood Baptist Church *Tile Hill Social Club (demolished August 2012) *Standard Triumph Social Club. *Wing Wah Chinese restaurant. *The Penny Farthing restaurant. *The Newlands public house. *The Bell Inn. *Jardine Crescent shopping precinct. * Hung Lay Thai Home Cooked Take Away 8 Station Road Notable residents The artist, George Shaw, moved into Tile Hill in 1968 with his family. The estate in Tile Hill his family moved to was built after the war, as part of the nationwide programme to create a modern future. The estate is open-plan, cut across by long paths and roads, and edged with woods, a remnant of what was once the Forest of Arden. George used this suburban environment as the inspiration to paint highly detailed, almost photo-realistic works using the novel medium of Humbrol Model Paint. The children‚Äôs author Cathy Cassidy also grew up in Tile Hill and used some of her childhood memories in her books. Notable events Tile Hill was a scene of carnage and made the national headlines on 19 December 1988 when the Tile Hill Village branch of Midland Bank was raided by two armed robbers. When police responded and pursued the raiders, one of them shot dead 29-year-old officer Gavin Carlton and wounded his colleague Leonard Jakeman as the pursuit reached Torrington Avenue. The gunman, 22-year-old David Fisher, then broke into a house in the city's Earlsdon district, where he was surrounded by armed officers before shooting himself dead. Roads named after people *Jardine Crescent is named after Dan Jardine, the Site Foreman during the construction of the Tile Hill North estate. *Dormer Harris Avenue is named after Mary Dormer Harris (1867‚Äì1936) the local historian. *Robert Cramb Avenue named after the Lord Mayor of Coventry in 1947. *James Green Road, named after the engineer responsible for surveying the route of the Bude Canal.

Soon after the station began broadcasting, student organizers discovered that licensing paperwork had never been filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which led to an end of broadcasting for the new station. In 2001, an LPFM tower construction permit was drafted and filed with the FCC. In 2003, Northland College was granted a 100-watt, low-power frequency to begin broadcasting in December of that year. WRNC-LP, in its latest incarnation, began broadcasting in May 2005. The station featured a variety of programming and operated twenty-four hours a day. The station also webcast its programming via its website. WRNC-LP ceased operations on or about May 23, 2017.

This stadium is part of the Marina Bay Street Circuit Turns 17 and 18, which hosted the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix. More infamously, it was where Nelson Piquet Jr. crashed his car which led to the Renault Formula One crash controversy. Following Singapore's successful bid to host the inaugural 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, the floating stadium was under the spotlight during the Games, as the venue for the Games' opening and closing ceremonies. Since 2010, the stadium has also been the venue for the graduation parade of full-time national servicemen passing out from the Basic Military Training Centre upon completing their basic military training. The Marina Bay Floating Platform has been the venue for several National Day Parades since 2007, although it supposed to be demolished after the completion of the Singapore Sports Hub because it was not intended to be a permanent structure, but the Sports Hub was too high of a cost to be spent for NDPs after the 2016 NDP took place, therefore due to popular demand, it returned to the float in 2017. It will continue to hold National Day Parade 2021, together with River Hongbao and F1, before it will be demolished in 2022 for the construction a permanent structure, the NS Square, which is slated to be completed in 2025. The NS Square will be a similar floating structure but with more facilities and a national service themed gallery. It is slated to have a seating capacity of about 30,000. In the second quarter of 2020, it is estimated a design proposal will be chosen for implementation. The proposal is expected to include a field that can be converted into a performance area, waterfront sports facility and a space for common exercise consisting of an unenclosed hall and studio spaces. Location The stadium is located along Raffles Avenue. History The Float@Marina Bay is the dark quadrilateral at foreground right of this view of Marina Bay from the Singapore Flyer. The idea of a floating platform was conceived by the organising committee of the 2007 National Day Parade. In 2004, Colonel Teo Jing Siong, the chairman of the committee, was asked to source for a new venue for the National Day Parade as the National Stadium would be demolished to make way for the new Singapore Sports Hub. Teo had considered Jalan Besar Stadium, the Singapore Turf Club and Marina South before settling on Marina Bay, partly because of the city skyline that would form a backdrop for the parade. The Singapore Government evaluated that the temporary stadium is a cost effective solution in lieu of the closure of the National Stadium that is under renovation for 8 years. In 2005, Teo's committee worked with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Singapore Sports Council on the design of the floating platform, which could also be used to host other major events. After the design was finalised, the contractor, Sembcorp Marine, started construction of the floating platform in March 2006. The stage took 13 months to build, and by April 2007, the platform and seating gallery were completed and officially opened by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Construction The 27,000-capacity grandstand and floating platform of The Float@Marina Bay, with the Singapore Flyer in the background. Many considerations were taken into account during the design phase for the construction of the floating platform. The Defence Science and Technology Agency, the platform's chief planner and developer, had to keep in mind not just its size and the load it could bear, but also make sure the structure can be relocated and reconfigured to meet the requirements of different events. As a result, the platform is made of smaller platforms of pontoons, each comprising hundreds of parts. 200 pontoons were envisioned, but a unique system of connectors allowed this number to be reduced to 15, which interlock like a jigsaw puzzle. These took one month to assemble. The connectors were designed to be light but robust. Six pylons fixed into the seabed act as the structure's foundation. Heavy-duty rubber rollers were used to gently guide the stage vertically to keep it from being rocked by tides and currents. Three linkways, which connect the floating platform to the land, have special integrated joints to keep them steady. The floating platform also had to be aesthetically pleasing to fit the scenic backdrop of the belt of hotels in Marina Centre. This limited the height of the seating gallery. The existing structures and the area's development plans capped the number of seats at 27,000. The platform has also been equipped with numerous innovative features, like an internal drainage system, cabling structures and lightning rods. Events Since its completion in 2007, the Marina Bay Floating Platform has hosted several major events, such the annual National Day Parade, New Year's Eve countdown event, 2010 Summer Youth Olympics and the Formula One. The first major event that was held at the floating stadium is the National Day Parade in 2007. This was followed by the Singapore Fireworks Celebrations held on 17 and 18 August 2007. On 25 August 2007, the stadium was used to launch the six-week-long Waterfest Singapore 2007, which showcases stunts and performances by a water ski team and wakeboard professionals. On 2 September 2007, the platform was the start and finish point for the Aviva Ironman 70.3 Singapore triathlon. The Float@Marina Bay viewed from the Helix Bridge. From 15 September 2007 to 16 April 2008, the floating stadium was closed for Formula One works in preparation for the Singapore Grand Prix in September 2008. In November 2008, The Singapore Cup final between SAFFC and Woodlands Wellington FC was supposed to take place at the stadium. However, problems relating to the metal beams casting a shadow on the pitch forced the match to be played at the Jalan Besar Stadium instead. The first football match to be played on the platform was a Sunday League ESPZEN amateur match between Tuan Gemuk Athletic and VNNTU FC. The Urban Redevelopment Authority had explored the area of making the 30,000-seat gallery available for the public to view fireworks during the New Year's Eve countdown at Marina Bay in December 2007, and following that it also used this stadium in each of the countdown parties till 2015 and shifted to Suntec City, before being shifted to The Promontory @ Marina Bay, as well as Stars Avenue. In August 2010, the stadium was the main stadium for the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. On 2 October 2010, the stadium became the first public venue for the graduation parade of the recruits from the Singapore Armed Forces Basic Military Training Centre. Previously, the graduation parade was held on Pulau Tekong itself. Since then, the stadium has been a venue for the graduation parade, alternating with the National Stadium. On 23 November 2012, SM Entertainment artists including Kangta, BoA, TVXQ, Super Junior, Girls' Generation, Shinee, f(x), and EXO performed to a crowd of 18,000 fans as part of their SM Town Live World Tour III concert. The National Day Parade has been held at the floating platform since 2007, excluding 2010, 2015 and 2016 where it was held at Padang and National Stadium respectively. In 2016, the National Day Parade was held at the National Stadium at the Singapore Sports Hub for the first time since its completion. The whole parade, however, costed a total about of S$39 million, while previous parades held at the floating platform costed about S$15 to S$18 million. Several segments of the annual parade such as the drive pass by the Singapore Army, parachute performance by the Singapore Armed Forces Parachute Team and fly pass by the Republic of Singapore Air Force were also omitted due to the dome structure of the National Stadium. Since then, the floating stadium continues to be the preferred venue for the annual parade, together with the Padang. It will be part of the National Day celebrations for 2021, before being demolished in 2022 to make way for the NS Square.

The name means 'Temple of 80,000 Buddha Images', and is also known as the 'Temple of Victory'. History The temple was built in 1535‚Äì1536 by King Min Bin to commemorate his conquest of Bengal.Gutman 2001: 96 It is located on the western face of Pokhaung Hill, north of the Royal Palace, and adjacent to the Andaw-thein Temple. It is typical of the many Buddhist temples found in Burma: a central bell-shaped stupa, surrounded by four smaller stupas at the corners, and a multitude of even-smaller stupas surrounding them. At the east of the temple, there is a recent (though about 75 years old) addition of a flight of stairs and tazaung. There is a central hall at the heart of the temple, which can be easily accessed. Hundreds of Buddha statues line the main hall, some of them in their original positions, others moved from nearby excavation sites. However, the Shitthaung's most prominent feature is not the central hall, but rather the three layers of maze-like corridors that encircle the main hall. The three corridors contain countless reliefs of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Kings of Spiritual abodes, Devas, guardian spirits, the 550 Jatakas, Arakanese culture and animals, both real and mythical. The Shite-thaung temple is the main attraction of Mrauk U. Adjacent to it lies another famous temple, the Htukkanthein Temple (Htukkan Ordination Hall).  Weather damage  Due to Mrauk U's tropical location, much of its temples have been damaged by the monsoon rain. It was discovered in 2003 that the central stupa had begun to leak, dissolving away some of the intricate statues in the two chambers. To prevent this, the local archaeological department hastily poured concrete over the stupas. This prevented the statues inside from being destroyed, but it also destroyed the outer appearance of the temple, which was the focal pagoda to most of the northern Arakanese. Many Arakanese criticize \\"the defacing\\" of their most treasured temple, but since it was the only way to prevent the more precious carvings inside, the actions have not been as widely condemned as expected.

The book traces the history of Anglo-Saxon copyright from the outgoing 15th century to the late 19th century. Starting with William Caxton's introduction of the printing press to England, Patterson documents the regulation of publishing in England and the United States. He identifies censorship as a driving force in early regulation and provides a detailed account of its impact on private copyright of the publisher's guild, the Stationers' Company. He describes the system of printing patents ‚Äì letters patent based on the Royal Prerogative that co-existed with the Stationer's copyright and remained unaffected by the Statute of Anne. Based on Patterson's dissertation, the book was first published in 1968. As of 2010 it is still in print. Kathy Bowrey ranks the books as one of two major contributions made by lawyers to the history of copyright: While she further notes that later authors writing on publisher and author perspectives on copyright failed to acknowledge the contributions made by Kaplan and Patterson, the book has still been widely cited in the academic literature. Then future United States Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, for instance, relied on Patterson in \\"The Uneasy Case for Copyright\\", a law review article written when Breyer was a practicing legal academic.

Traicho Kostov, at the age of 52, was sentenced to death by the Bulgarian Supreme Court. He was tried together with ten others in Sofia from 7 December till 14 December 1949. Two days later he was executed. Kostov was the leading figure of the Bulgarian Communist Party. On 31 March 1949 Kostov was dismissed from his post of acting President of the Council of Ministers and President of the Economic-Financial Committee of the Council of Ministers. Fifteen days later he was appointed Director of the Bulgarian National Library in Sofia. At a plenum of the Central Committee held on 11 and 12 June 1949, Vasil Kolarov delivered an indictment of Kostov's anti-Party activity. Kostov was accused of tolerating and spreading anti-Soviet sentiment in the Party because of his nationalistic deviation, of using anti-Party methods in the Party and Government leadership and trying to kindle a fractional struggle in the Party, of attempting to cause mistrust in the Communist Party and the Party leader, Georgi Dimitrov. Kostov was dismissed from the Central Committee, expelled from the Party and deprived of his seat in the National Assembly. He was arrested on 20 June 1949. In December 1949, together with Traicho Kostov, 10 other prominent Communists were tried. Kostov was sentenced to death on the grounds that he had organized the headquarters of an underground organization aiming to overthrow the government by violence, had committed actions aiming at the worsening of the friendly relations between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union and the other people's democracies, had placed himself under the orders of the British, American and Yugoslav intelligence services for espionage, that while fulfilling state duties and instructions before foreign governments he had deliberately performed his services and carried out his instructions to the detriment of the state and he had committed acts aiming at the disorganization of the national economy and the supply system of the country and that he had close political connections with Tito, who had broken with Stalin. Kostov repudiated his written confession and the trial proceeded in his absence. A further indictment was Kostov's outspoken criticism of the USSR's economic practices in Eastern Europe. At the time, the USSR was buying Bulgarian tobacco at an incredibly low price and then flooding the world market with it - at prices which undercut Bulgaria (G. and N. Swain, 2003). Another example of this type is Polish coal. The other 10 accused prominent Communists, among them ministers and high Party officials, received life imprisonment, 15 or 12 years sentences. Kostov's trial was followed in 1950 and 1951 by several other trials against his adherents. During the preparation of these staged trials most inhuman types of interrogation methods were used and more than 30 prominent Communists were sentenced to long term imprisonment. The start of open de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union led to a reassessment of the Kostovite trials. On 11 April 1956, at a Sofia City Communist Party meeting it was stated that: a harmful consequence of the personality cult had been the infringement of the laws, as a result of which innocent people were unjustly accused and sentenced. The accusations contained in the indictment and in other materials presented at the Traicho Kostov trial and at other trials that followed, in which those sentenced were unjustly accused of espionage, sabotage and criminal relations with Yugoslav state organisations and leaders, were dismissed as being fabricated and not true. All those detained because of these trials had been set free. A commission of the Central Committee had been entrusted with checking the materials on the trials, so that all innocently accused would be rehabilitated. A decision of the Central Committee, published on 19 September 1956, approved the statements and the conclusions of the commission which had reviewed the Kostov trial and the trials connected with it. It also legally rehabilitated and restored party membership to all those convicted in the trials. Kostov himself was posthumously rehabilitated and readmitted to the party. The legal annulment of the sentences had been made by the Bulgarian Supreme Court on 6 November 1956. This decision of the Court was not made public in the Bulgarian press.

The main battle took place on the 1 October 1860 between 30,000 Garibaldines (mostly defected Sicilians, including from Calabria) and 25,000 Bourbon troops (Neapolitans). Background After Garibaldi's Expedition of Thousand had conquered Sicily and much of southern Italy with a startling speed, entering in Naples on the 7 September while the King Francis II of Two Sicilies took refuge in the powerful fortress of Gaeta, midway between Rome and Naples. In the meantime the Neapolitan army was rebuilt in Capua under marshal Giosu√® Ritucci, the first skirmishes with Garibaldi's volunteers occurring on the 26 and 29 September. On the 30 September a Neapolitan corps crossed the river Volturno at Triflisco, marching towards Santa Maria a Vologno, but was halted by two Garibaldine brigades. The following day Ritucci then decided a frontal attack with two divisions against Garibaldi's centre, which occupied a line running from Sant'Angelo in Formis and Santa Maria a Vico. After defeating the enemy, Ritucci was to reach Caserta and then Naples itself. Battle The two armies met on the western front on the 1 October, in which the Neapolitans, spurred by the presence of Francis himself, forced the Garibaldines to retreat. Garibaldi and his fellow Giacomo Medici intervened, re-establishing the situation. Harsh fights were taking place in the meantime at Santa Maria, but at 6:00pm the Neapolitans were pushed back; the Garibaldines were however defeated on the hills neat Monte Tifata, Monte Vito and Castel Morrone. Nino Bixio, who defended the road to Maddaloni, was initially defeated by the attack of the Bavarian and Swiss brigade of General Giovan Luca von Mechel. In his support arrived colonel Giuseppe Dezza with two Bersaglieri battalions, which pushed back von Mechel northwards, up to Ducenta. At that point the only undefeated Bourbon column was that of colonel Perrone, who was in Capua with 3,000 troops. The city was attacked on 2:00am by the Garibaldines and one Piedmontese regular Bersaglieri battalion, and captured. Consequences A scene from the battle After this battle, the largest by Garibaldi's expedition, both sides seemed exhausted. In the immediate aftermath, the battle was viewed as a defeat for Garibaldi, but in the longer term, it proved to his side's advantage. The cost for Garibaldi in men was higher: 306 killed and 1,327 wounded, but the Neapolitan forces had lost almost 1,000 in killed and wounded themselves and over 2,000 taken prisoner. The Bourbon army was unable to use its victory to capture Caserta. Both armies showed bravery, except perhaps for the Royal Guards and troops of Ruiz de Ballesteros, who were the largest cause of the defeat. Garibaldi was forced to request troops from the Piedmontese. Yet while Francesco II wished to use the impasse for the Garibaldi forces, to attack again, his generals recommended that the troops be reorganised. Thus he left Capua for Gaeta, and was unable to retake his throne. Soon Piedmontese reinforcements arrived, defeating the Royal troops at Gaeta, and causing the King to flee.From Spanish Wikipedia See also *Risorgimento *Siege of Gaeta (1860) References=External links * Cerino Badone Giovanni, Volturno 1860.

The cowl, usually made of galvanized iron, is fitted to the chimney pot to prevent wind blowing the smoke back down into the room below. Undoubtedly named after the resemblance of many designs to the cowl garment worn by monks, they have been in use for centuries. When using an open fire to heat a room the smoke rises through a flue to a chimney pot on the roof. Under normal conditions the warm air from the fire will rise up the chimney emitting the smoke with it and dispersing it at rooftop level where it is less of a nuisance. In strong winds the pressure of the wind may overwhelm the updraft and push the airflow in reverse down the flue. Smoke will then fill the room it is intended to heat posing a health and fire risk, causing discomfort and dirtying furnishings in its path. When raw coal rather than smokeless fuel is burnt, the amount of smoke may be considerable and measures to prevent backflow occurring are a necessity. A secondary function is to prevent birds and squirrels from nesting in the chimney. They often also act as a rain guard to keep rain from going down the chimney. A metal wire mesh is sometimes added as a spark arrestor. Wooden cowls were used on oasts to prevent the ingress of rain into kilns, and create a flow of air through the kiln. A H-style cap (cowl) is a chimney top constructed from chimney pipes shaped like the letter H. It is an age-old method to regulate draft in situations where prevailing winds or turbulence cause downdraft and backpuffing. Although the H-cap has a distinctive advantage over most other downdraft caps, it fell out of favor because of its bulky looks. It is found mainly in marine use but has been gaining popularity again for its energy saving functionality. The H-cap stabilizes the draft rather than increasing it. Other downdraft caps are based on the Venturi effect, solving downdraft problems by increasing the updraft constantly resulting in much higher fuel consumption.

Such cowls are designed to afford protection to the flue while still allowing a degree of ventilation.

The Byzantines, led by the old eunuch general Narses, were victorious.  Background  During the later stages of the Gothic War, the Gothic king Teia called upon the Franks for help against the Roman armies under the eunuch Narses. Although King Theudebald refused to send aid, he allowed two of his subjects, the Alemanni chieftains Leutharis and Butilinus, to cross into Italy. According to the historian Agathias, the two brothers gathered a host of 75,000 Franks and Alemanni, and in early 553 crossed the Alps and took the town of Parma. They defeated a force under the Heruli commander Fulcaris, and soon many Goths from northern Italy joined their forces. In the meantime, Narses dispersed his troops to garrisons throughout central Italy, and himself wintered at Rome. In the spring of 554, the two brothers invaded central Italy, plundering as they descended southwards, until they came to Samnium. There they divided their forces, with Butilinus and the larger part of the army marching south towards Campania and the Strait of Messina, while Leutharis led the remainder towards Apulia and Otranto. Leutharis, however, soon turned back home, laden with spoils. His vanguard, however, was heavily defeated by the Armenian Byzantine Artabanes at Fanum, leaving most of the booty behind. The remainder managed to reach northern Italy and cross the Alps into Frankish territory, but not before losing more men to a plague, including Leutharis himself. Butilinus, on the other hand, more ambitious and possibly persuaded by the Goths to restore their kingdom with himself as king, resolved to remain. His army was infected by dysentery, so that it was reduced from its original size of 30,000 to a size close to that of Narses' forces. In summer, Butilinus marched back to Campania and erected camp on the banks of the Volturnus, covering its exposed sides with an earthen rampart, reinforced by his numerous supply wagons. A bridge over the river was fortified by a wooden tower, heavily garrisoned by the Franks. Deployment When Narses found out about the location of the Frankish camp, he set forth at the head of an 18,000 strong force, including strong contingents of Heruli mercenaries. His army included infantry, heavy cavalry, and horse archers, and was thus at an advantage over the mostly infantry-based enemy forces. As the Romans approached the Frankish camp, Narses sent an Armenian officer, Charananges, with a cavalry force to cut the Franks' supply. Indeed, Charananges not only captured several wagons, but used one of them to set fire to the large watchtower guarding the bridge. After this first skirmish, both sides exited their camps and formed up for battle. At that point, an incident almost wrecked the Byzantine plans. A Heruli captain killed a servant, and when confronted by Narses, refused to acknowledge any fault. Narses had him executed, whereupon the rest of the Heruli announced that they refused to fight. Nevertheless, Narses drew up his forces for battle. Faced with the solid and deep-arrayed Frankish infantry, he chose a disposition similar to that of the Battle of Taginae, with the infantry in the centre, backed by archers, and the cavalry on the wings. Narses himself took command of the right wing, while Artabanes and Valerian were placed in charge of the left wing. Part of the left wing was also concealed in a wood that grew there. At the pleas of the Heruli general, Sindual, who promised to persuade his men to fight, he left a gap in the middle of the infantry, which the Heruli were to occupy. Battle However, two Heruli had deserted to the Franks, and persuaded Butilinus to attack now while the Heruli stayed out of the battle. The Franks arrayed in a large wedge formation and advanced, and smashed into the Byzantine centre. They quickly penetrated the gap left by the Heruli, but Narses commanded his cavalry, which included many horse archers, to wheel on their flanks and attack the Franks from their exposed rear. The Franks, already engaged with the Byzantine infantry, were unable to turn and face their more mobile enemies in the rear. As confusion started to spread amongst them, the Heruli finally returned to the fray. In the words of J.B. Bury, \\"... then Sindual and his Heruli appeared upon the scene. The defeat of the Franks was already certain; it was now to be annihilation.\\" Aftermath Butilinus and most of his men perished, while Roman casualties were small. Agathias gives the impossibly low number of 80 Byzantine casualties, while claiming that only five Goths survived. Whatever the true numbers, it was a magnificent victory for Narses, and signaled the final triumph of the Byzantine Empire in Italy. Despite Narses' great victories, the war was not finished. Seven thousand Goths held out at Campsa, near Naples until they capitulated in the spring of 555. The lands and cities across the River Po were still held by Franks and Goths, and it was not until 562 that their last strongholds, the cities of Verona and Brixia, were subjugated.

History Maguire was named for local resident William Maguire, a shoemaker, who had originally immigrated to Canada from Enniskillen Ireland in order to escape the economic conditions brought on by the Great Famine of Ireland of 1845-49. Maguire obtained several pieces of property in the vicinity, including one immediately south of the current intersection. A post office was opened in 1882, with Alexander Todd being named as the Postmaster. In 1884, Todd opened a general store on the south-east corner, also during this period, John Ryan operated a blacksmith business nearby. There is evidence to indicate that a log dwelling, or inn, once existed at the northeast corner of the intersection. Todd operated the store until 1912, when the business was sold to John Strange, father of Cy Strange, who in addition to running the general store, established a sawmill on the property. John Strange also ran the post office until it was closed on December 1, 1913. The general store itself ceased operation in 1920, when the building was converted into a mill and the structure was finally demolished in 1944. During the 1940s, John Hotson built and operated a machine repair shop on the west side of Maguire Road, south of the intersection, opposite the former site of the general store. The remaining structure currently on that location, is not the original Hotson's machine shop, but rather a former church out building relocated from Crediton, Ontario which is now used as a barn. Farther to the south at Ebenezer Cemetery, William and Elizabeth Maguire and Alexander Todd are at rest. A small memorial plaque commemorating the former existence of the community is located on the east side of Maguire Road, marking the former location of the front steps of the original general store and post office.

The CMA consists of the central city of Chennai and its suburbs distributed in Kanchipuram, Chengpattu and Thiruvallur districts. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is the nodal agency that handles town planning and development within the metro area. Since 1974, an area encompassing 1189 km2 around the city has been designated as the CMA and the CMDA has been designated as the authority to plan the growth of the city and the area around it. CMDA masterplan for the CMA  Economy  Chennai metropolitan area's economy of US$58.6 billion PPP (US$17 billion nominal GDP, 2010) is currently rated the fourth-largest economy in India, ahead of the Bangalore metropolitan area and after the Kolkata metropolitan area.Rankings of cities by metropolitan area GDP can vary as a result of differences in the definition of the boundaries and population sizes of the areas compared and the method used to calculate output While no official figure has been given for the population in the newly expanded Chennai metropolitan area, the urban population was estimated to be over 10 million in early 2017. The 2011 census figure for the population of the Chennai \\"UA/Metropolitan region\\" was 8,653,521.  Composition  The CMA is a metropolitan area in Tamil Nadu state, consisting of the state capital Chennai (previously known as Madras) and its satellite towns. Developing over a period of about 20 years, it consists of 8 municipal corporations and 14 smaller municipal councils. The entire area is overseen by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), a Tamil Nadu State Government organisation in charge of town planning, development, transportation and housing in the region. The CMDA was formed to address the challenges in planning and development of integrated infrastructure for the metropolitan region. The areas outside Greater Chennai Corporation (Chennai District) like Kanchipuram and Tiruvallur have lacked organised development. The CMA comprises the city of Chennai, 8 Municipalities, 11 Town Panchayats and 179 Village Panchayats in 10 Panchayat Unions. The CMA has an area of 1,189 km2. It includes the whole of the Chennai District, along with the Ambattur, Gummidipoondi, Madhavaram, Ponneri, Poonamallee, Avadi and Tiruvallur taluks of the Tiruvallur District, Sriperumbudur and Kundrathur taluks of the Kancheepuram District, Pallavaram, Vandalur and Tambaram taluks of the Chengalpattu district. The CMA falls in three Districts of the Tamil Nadu State viz. Chennai District, part of Thiruvallur District, and part of Kancheepuram District. The extent of the Chennai District (covered in Chennai Municipal Corporation area) is 426 km2 and comprises 55 revenue villages in 10 Taluks [viz. (i) Tondiarpet Taluk, (ii) Perambur Taluk, (iii) Purasawalkam Taluk, (iv) Egmore Taluk, (v) Mambalam Taluk, (vi) Guindy Taluk, (vii) Mylapore Taluk, (viii) Velachery Taluk, (ix) Aminjikarai Taluk and (x) Ayanavaram Taluk. In Thiruvallur District out of total district area of 3,427 km2, 637 km2. in Ambattur, Thiruvallur, Ponneri and Poonamallee taluks fall in CMA. In Kancheepuram District out of 4,433 km2, 376 km2 in Tambaram, Sriperumbudur and Chengalpattu district fall in the metropolitan area. CMA region has about 3,000 water bodies, most of which have been encroached upon by real estate dealers and small communities. The Chennai metropolitan area is set to be expanded further, incorporating the entire districts of Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram, and the Arakkonam taluk, Nemili Taluk of the Ranipet district. In future it may expand further. Plans to expand Chennai Metropolitan Area seven folds from existing 1,189 sq.km to 8,878 sq.km appears to be scaled down in view of opposition from the farmer in giving up their agricultural lands. The Government is looking at maximum utilization of the available spaces in the core city and urbanized pockets in the suburbs for residential development. Only area well connected with the available rail infrastructure will be included in the expansion plan of CMA. The extent of expansion will be scaled down from 8,878 sq.km to 3,000‚Äì4,000 sq.km.

The first plans to expand the CMA were proposed by the CMDA in 2011. The need for expansion arose as several nearby settlements such as Sriperumbudur, Kelambakkam, Tiruvallur and Maraimalai Nagar had been undergoing rapid development and had to be incorporated under the CMDA planning strategy. Also, the planning bodies of other metropolises in India such as Bengaluru, New Delhi and Hyderabad had already redefined their respective metropolitan regions to include much larger areas and corresponding regional planning was being done. The CMA, however, has not been altered since it was first defined in 1974. The area was limited to which is among the smallest in the country. In July 2012, the CMDA suggested two options to the Government of Tamil Nadu for expanding the area: *The first option includes whole of the Chennai district, Madhavaram, Ambattur, Poonamallee, Ponneri, Gummidipoondi, Uthukottai, and Thiruvallur taluks of the Tiruvallur district, and Alandur, Pallavaram, Tambaram, Sholinganallur, Chengalpattu, Thiruporur, and Sriperumbudur taluks of the Kancheepuram district extending up to . * The second option includes the whole of Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts and the Arakkonam taluk of Vellore district and extends to a total of . Chief planners of the CMDA have suggested that the second option is more feasible. Another planning model, similar to the National Capital Region was also examined by the CMDA. In order to plan for balanced regional development, developing a larger road network, implementing an integrated transport plan and identifying a Chennai Mega Region have become necessary. On 3 July 2017 the Government of Tamil Nadu's minister for housing and urban development, Udumalai K. Radhakrishnan announced its intention to expand the CMA to . The extension will cover all of Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts and Arakkonam taluk of Vellore district, as proposed in July 2012. Having completed a feasibility study, a \\"strategic regional plan\\" was now required, and completion of the whole process was expected by July 2018. On 22 January 2018 the Government of Tamil Nadu issued order G.O. (Ms) No.13 to \\"declare the intention to include additional areas in the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area\\" under section 2, clause (23-a) of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971 (Tamil Nadu Act 35 of 1972). The additional areas to be included were as proposed by the CMDA in 2017.

Tigas was formed in 2004, with 20 stores. In 2011, Tigas has grown to more than 70 stores in Malaysia. Tigas is situated in neighbourhood and suburb locations throughout the country. Each pharmacy is operated by qualified pharmacists who are available during pharmacy opening hours.  Store profile  Tigas stores are typically owner-operated by the pharmacists themselves, each focusing on pharmacy community services in and around their local neighbourhoods. Tigas stores services customers with drugs, over-the-counter (OTC) medications and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG).  History  The name \\"Tigas\\" is derived from \\"Tiga\\" in the Malay language (Bahasa Malaysia), meaning \\"three\\", and \\"S\\" is the acronym for Supply-chain stakeholders, symbolic of the three links in the pharmacy supply-chain: better preventive health, connecting pharmacists to consumers and health solutions. The Tigas concept is no different from the banner pharmacy groups in existence in US, UK and Australia. Banner pharmacy groups refer to largescale alliances between independent pharmacies, coming together under an umbrella brand to take advantage of economies of scale in purchasing, coordinated promotions and cohesive marketing programmes. The Tigas marketing concept allows for its pharmacy members to enjoy a loyalty card program, together with increased patronage from consumers by acting as fulfilment points for wellness programs, drug dispensing programs and healthcare benefits programs.

It presents a continuation of earlier efforts, most directly the Data Protection Directive. It deals with the regulation of a number of important issues such as confidentiality of information, treatment of traffic data, spam and cookies. This Directive has been amended by Directive 2009/136, which introduces several changes, especially in what concerns cookies, that are now subject to prior consent. Some EU lawmakers had hoped the ePrivacy Regulation (ePR) could come into force at the same time as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018. and will repeal the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC and accompany the GDPR and regulate the requirements for consent to the use of cookies and opt-out options.ePrivacy Regulation on Europa.euePrivacy Regulation and the GDPR on eprivacy.euHighlights ePrivacy Regulation on fieldfisher.com Subject-matter and Scope The Electronic Privacy Directive has been drafted specifically to address the requirements of new digital technologies and ease the advance of electronic communications services.See Preamble of the Directive The Directive complements the Data Protection Directive and applies to all matters which are not specifically covered by that Directive.see Article 1 In particular, the subject of the Directive is the \\"right to privacy in the electronic communication sector\\" and free movement of data, communication equipment and services. The Directive does not apply to Titles V and VI (Second and Third Pillars constituting the European Union). Likewise, it does not apply to issues concerning public security and defence, state security and criminal law.Article 1(3) The interception of data was however covered by the EU Data Retention Directive, prior to its annulment by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Contrary to the Data Protection Directive, which specifically addresses only individuals, Article 1(2) makes it clear that ePrivacy Directive also applies to legal persons. Main provisions The first general obligation in the Directive is to provide security of services.Article 4 The addressees are providers of electronic communications services. This obligation also includes the duty to inform the subscribers whenever there is a particular risk, such as a virus or other malware attack.Article 4(2) The second general obligation is for the confidentiality of information to be maintained.Article 5 The addressees are Member States, who should prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communication and \\"related traffic\\", unless the users have given their consent or conditions of Article 15(1) have been fulfilled. Data retention and other issues The directive obliges the providers of services to erase or anonymise the traffic data processed when no longer needed, unless the conditions from Article 15 have been fulfilled.Article 6 Retention is allowed for billing purposes but only as long as the statute of limitations allows the payment to be lawfully pursued. Data may be retained upon a user's consent for marketing and value-added services. For both previous uses, the data subject must be informed why and for how long the data is being processed. Subscribers have the right to non-itemised billing.Article 7 Likewise, the users must be able to opt out of calling-line identification.Article 8 Where data relating to location of users or other traffic can be processed, Article 9 provides that this will only be permitted if such data is anonymised, where users have given consent, or for provision of value-added services. Like in the previous case, users must be informed beforehand of the character of information collected and have the option to opt out.Article 9(2) Unsolicited e-mail and other messages Article 13 prohibits the use of email addresses for marketing purposes. The Directive establishes the opt-in regime, where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient. A natural or legal person who initially collects address data in the context of the sale of a product or service, has the right to use it for commercial purposes provided the customers have a prior opportunity to reject such communication where it was initially collected and subsequently. Member States have the obligation to ensure that unsolicited communication will be prohibited, except in circumstances given in Article 13. Two categories of emails (or communication in general) will also be excluded from the scope of the prohibition. The first is the exception for existing customer relationships and the second for marketing of similar products and services.Article 13(2) The sending of unsolicited text messages, either in the form of SMS messages, push mail messages or any similar format designed for consumer portable devices (mobile phones, PDAs) also falls under the prohibition of Article 13.Recital 40, Preamble Cookies The Directive provision applicable to cookies is Article 5(3). Recital 25 of the Preamble recognises the importance and usefulness of cookies for the functioning of modern Internet and directly relates Article 5(3) to them but Recital 24 also warns of the danger that such instruments may present to privacy. The change in the law does not affect all types of cookies; those that are deemed to be \\"strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by the user\\", such as for example, cookies that track the contents of a user's shopping cart on an online shopping service, are exempted. The article is technology neutral, not naming any specific technological means which may be used to store data, but applies to any information that a website causes to be stored in a user's browser. This reflects the EU legislator's desire to leave the regime of the directive open to future technological developments. The addressees of the obligation are Member States, who must ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information in a visitor's browser is only allowed if the user is provided with \\"clear and comprehensive information\\", in accordance with the Data Protection Directive, about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and has given their consent. The regime so set-up can be described as opt-in, effectively meaning that the consumer must give their consent before cookies or any other form of data is stored in their browser. The UK Regulations allow for consent to be signified by future browser settings, which have yet to be introduced but which must be capable of presenting enough information so that a user can give their informed consent and indicating to a target website that consent has been obtained. Initial consent can be carried over into repeated content requests to a website. The Directive does not give any guidelines as to what may constitute an opt-out, but requires that cookies, other than those \\"strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by the user\\" are not to be placed without user consent.

Early life and education Ibragimova was born in Polevskoy, Russian SSR, to a Bashkir family. Her family was musical, and she began playing the violin at the age of 4. At 5 she started at the Gnessin School of Music in Moscow, studying under Valentina Korolkova, and by the age of 6 had started her career by playing with various orchestras, including the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra.

He served under two Sultans of Johor, namely; Sultan Ali Jalla Abdul Jalil Shah II (1570‚Äì1597) and Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah III (1597‚Äì1615) and also advisers to 3 Acheh sultans namely; Sultan Iskandar Muda (until 1636), Sultan Iskandar Thani (1636‚Äì1641) and Sultana Tajul Alam Safiatuddin Shah (1641‚Äì1675). He had two honorific titles throughout his lifetime; as the Bendahara of Johor, Bendahara Paduka Raja Tun Mohamad,The title Bendahara Paduka Raja being his honorific. while he was given the title of Orang Kaya Dato' Bendahara Seri Paduka Tun Seberang after settling in Aceh. Early life and events in Johor Tun Sri Lanang was born in 1565 in Seluyut, Johore, and was descended from Tun Tahir, a brother of Bendahara Tun Mutahir of Malacca.Hamilton, Source of the Malacca Johore and Pahang Genealogies, pg 148 There are not many records about his period as Bendehara in Johore. However, during the rule of Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah III, he shouldered a heavier burden on the affairs of the state as the Sultan is a weak ruler. He shared the responsibility with the Sultan's brother Raja Abdullah (later to become Sultan Abdullah Maayah Shah which reigns between 1615 to 1623). During the period the Dutch were attacking the Portuguese for the port of Malacca. The Dutch signed a friendship treaty with the Johore Sultanate (in 1606) with Tun Sri Lanang as a representative. Tun Sri Lanang refused the Dutch request of helping the Dutch to blockade the port of Malacca preferring the Dutch do it themselves. In 1612, at the request of Raja Abdullah to pen the Malay Annals to ensure \\" ... all the adat, the rules and the ceremonies of the Malay Sultans and Rajas to be heard by our descendants and is made known all utterances so that it may benefit them\\".

In 1613, Acheh attacked Johor and in the battle of Batu Sawar. Johore was defeated and the Royal Family and Tun Sri Lanang was captured and brought to Aceh. The Bendaharaship was continued by his descendants. His notable descendants include Bendehara Tun Habib Abdul Majid and the Raja Temenggung of Muar.Haji Buyong bin Adil, Sejarah Terengganu, pg 207Winstedt, A History of Johore, pg 189, 194 Later life in Aceh After a brief \\"reeducation\\" in Aceh, the Johor Royal Family was returned to Johor. Tun Sri Lanang elected to stay in Acheh. He became advisor to the third Sultan of Acheh and was bestowed an Acheh honorific title. He was awarded a personal fief in Samalanga, Aceh in 1613 and held the title Uleebalang of Samalanga. He died in 1659 in Samalanga.(Tun) Suzana (Tun) Othman, Tun Seri Lanang, Sejarah dan Warisan Tokoh Melayu Tradisional, page 89 Legacy Some of Tun Sri Lanang's descendants ruled as the Uleebalang of Samalanga until 1949, when Indonesia was formed in the same year.

Some of his descendants carry the \\"Bedahara\\" suffix to their names indicating their ancestry. His legacy is not only the rewriting and compiling of the magnum opus \\"Sejarah Melayu\\" but also includes the strongly Islamic flavor of Samalanga. Samalanga is also known as \\"Kota Santri\\", or \\"Town of Medrassas\\" is the centre of Islamic propagation in Acheh until today.
