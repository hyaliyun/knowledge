History=Earlier statues in wood and stone The succession of statues dedicated to Erasmus is testimony to the civic pride he elicited in his native city. A first statue is mentioned by early-17C printer Matthijs Bastiaensz as having been sent in 1536, the year of Erasmus's death, by the civic leaders of Basel where he died, but is not otherwise attested. A wooden statue was erected on the occasion of Philip of Habsburg's princely visit in Rotterdam on 27 1549. It played a specific role in the visit's choreography. The statue was hollow and enabled a young boy to stay inside. As Philip approached, the boy recited a Latin poem, making it appear as if Erasmus himself was praising the visitor. In 1557 a more durable statue of Erasmus was made in Belgian blue stone. In 1572, during the War of Holland, Spanish troops under Count of Bossu threw the statue into a canal. It was later recovered and placed on the Grotemarkt. The bronze statue On 18 April 1616, the City of Rotterdam decided to commission a new statue, following a recommendation from Hugo Grotius who had become Pensionary of the city in 1613. Hendrick de Keyser, who in 1614 had received the commission for the tomb of William the Silent in Delft, was selected and contracted on 29 August 1618. The statue was cast after his death on 5 May 1621 by local founder Jan Cornelisz. , under supervision by Hendrick's son Pieter de Keyser. The statue was eventually erected on 30 April 1622. Its cost exceeded 10,000 guilders, a very large sum for a work of art. It was originally gilded, but soon took a green patina. Joost van den Vondel wrote a poem about it that same year, titled To the splendid metal statue in Rotterdam erected in honour of the great Erasmus. It was the first public statue in bronze in the Netherlands, and unique in Europe as it honored an intellectual luminary rather than a military or political leader. Erasmus is depicted as a theologian, reading a large Bible. Local legend has it that Erasmus turns a page of the book every hour at the stroke of the clock. Later developments The statue in the 17th Century In 1674, the statue was deposed for repairs as it was at risk of falling over. It was re-erected on 22 April 1677. The current pedestal is a modern copy of the one that was created on this occasion. It displays two inscriptions in Latin. The first quote, by writer and illustrator Joachim Oudaan (1628-1692), reads: DESIDERIO ERASMO / MAGNO SCIENTIARVM ATQUE LITTERATVRAE / POLITIORIS VINDICI ET INSTAVRATORI / VIRO SAECVLI SVI PRIMARIO / CIVI OMNIVM PRAESTANTISSIMO / AC NOMINIS IMMORTALITATEM SCRIPTIS / AEVITERNIS IVRE CONSECVTO / S.P.Q. ROTERODAMVS / NE QVOD TANTIS APVD SE / SVOSQVE POSTEROS / VIRTVTIBVS PRAEMIVM DEESSET / STATVAM HANC EX AERE PVBLICO / ERIGENDAM CVRAVERUNT. The second quote, by Nicolaas Heinsius the Elder, reads: BARBARIAE TALEM SE DEBELLATOR ERASMVS / MAXIMA LAVS BATAVI NOMINIS ORE TVLIT / REDDIDIT EN FATIS ARS OBLVCTATA SINISTRIS / DE TANTO SPOLIVM NACTA QVOD VRNA VIRO EST / INGENII COELESTE IVBAR MAIVSQVE CADVCO / TEMPORE QVI REDDAT SOLVS ERASMVS ERIT. It was hit by cannon from Napoleon's troops in 1810. In 1940 ahead of the German invasion, the statue was moved to a protected location, buried under the courtyard of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. On 29 July 1945 it was re-erected, intact, on Coolsingel; it was moved to its current location in 1964. It was listed as a Rijksmonument on 11 September 1973. The statue was torn down by vandals in 1996 but did not suffer major damage. It was subsequently repaired and re- erected on 29 January 1998. Erasmus Monument In October 2016, a separate Erasmus monument was unveiled nearby, on the site of the house where Erasmus was born in 1466 (according to current scholarly consensus). It evokes the disappeared house's facade and is covered with blue-and-wide tiles that evoke Erasmus and his works.

He was known for his alliance with the Spanish captain Hernán Cortés, formed in 15 July 1519, which made him one of the first allies of the Spanish during the conquest of the Mexica Empire. His political position as ruler of Cempoala made him a highly important person in the empire, as the city is sometimes referred to as \\"the capital of the Totonac empire\\", due to its influence over other Totonac settlements.  Name and physical appearance  Several plants described in the Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis. Chicomácatl is the last one on this page (left to right). Bernal Díaz del Castillo refers to the ruler of Cempoala as \\"Fat Cacique\\" in his book Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España (True history of the conquest of New Spain), due to his physical aspect. He was described as being overwhelmingly corpulent by the Spaniards, and was likely tall. Díaz del Castillo writes: > Let's stop joking around, and let's say how we got to the rooms, and the Fat > Cacique came out to receive us next to the yard, and because he was very > fat, that's how i'll call him [...] The Spanish 16th-century historian Francisco López de Gómara writes: > These indians were very different from the rest they had seen, because they > had taller bodies, [...] because Cortés wished to be very informed about the > land and that great king Moctezuma, and the sire was very tough, though fat, > when demanding points and asking questions. Historians commonly refer to him as Xicomecoatl (), but nobody knows for sure if this was his actual name. Chicomácatl () is also one of the names used to refer to him. This name's origin is possibly from a plant used for medical purposes described in the Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis (in Latin, Little book of the Medicinal Herbs of the Indians).  Alliance with Spain  According to various chroniclers, Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin (also known as Moctezuma II), tlatoani of Tenochtitlan, capital of the Mexica Empire, had forced the city of Cempoala into submission before making contact with the europeans, and forced its people into paying large tributes for the tlatoani. Cortés wrote to emperor Carlos I of Spain in his second relation letter, dated 30 October 1520: > And I left that province of Cempoal along with all the towns in the mound, > which might be up to fifty thousand warriors and fifty towns and fortresses, > very safe, peaceful and loyal vassals of your majesty as so far they have > been and are, because they were subjects of that sire Muteezuma , and > according to what I was informed, they were forced into being so, and not > too long ago.  Meeting Cortés  Xicomecoatl met Cortés in 15 July 1519. Upon hearing about the news about the \\"towers\\" or \\"temples\\" that had arrived at the sea that were filled with strange foreign men who were now going to the capital, Xicomecoatl sent 12 ambassadors to meet these new people and welcome them into Cempoala. At first, Cortés asked some questions to make sure the arrival would be safe, supposedly asking: > \\"If your town was so close to us, why did it take that long to tell us about > it?\\" To this they responded that they wanted to make sure that \\"no Mexicans would enter, since they do much damage to their people\\". They accepted the offer and went to the city the following day using the ambassadors to guide them into the city, sending half of them back into Cempoala to tell Xicomecoatl that they were going in peace. For the first time, the Spanish were going to enter into territory within the borders of the empire. When first arriving at the city, the Spaniards were amazed by its size, as it was the first city of high importance they had seen during their travels. Cortés and some of his soldiers decided to name this city after Seville, while others named it \\"Villa-viciosa\\" (Busy-town). Díaz del Castillo wrote: > And as we were entering between the houses, as we saw such a big city, > because we haven't seen any bigger, we were very amazed about it, and as we > saw how busy it was, filled with men and women in the streets coming out to > see us, we praised God because of the lands we had discovered. \\"Hernán Cortés enters Zempoala and is received by the Cacique Gordo\\" by Juan González and Miguel González, 1698 Xicomecoatl and Cortés finally met in the main square of Cempoala, outside the palace of the city. There, Cortés and Xicomecoatl hugged each other as a sign of friendship. Xicomecoatl offered them a large place to reside during their stay in the city. He offered them food, such a cornbread and \\"plums\\", as Díaz del Castillo wrote (possibly referring to prickly pear fruit?). They began to give each other gifts, such as jewelry, clothes and gold. Cortés, alongside his translators and interpreters, Doña Marina (also known as La Malinche) and Gerónimo de Aguilar, told the ruler that they would return the favor by helping them with whatever they wanted: > And Cortés told him, with Doña Marina and Aguilar, that we would pay him > with favors, because we are vassals of a great sire, who is the emperor Don > Carlos, who rules over many kingdoms and states, and he sent us to solve > grievances, to punish the evil, and to stop the sacrifice of any more souls. According to Díaz del Castillo, upon hearing these claims, Xicomecoatl began to complain about Moctezuma, claiming that his people used to live in peace and freedom before he forced them into submission, and now they had to pay tributes to him, and that he took almost all of the city's gold and jewelry, and there was nothing they could do about it because they feared that he would kill them all if they tried. Other members of the court described that all the lands around belonged to Moctezuma, and though most of them had their own ruler, they were all vassals of the tlatoani, and some were treated like slaves for him. Cortés stated that he understood the ruler perfectly, and they would do something to help. Supposedly, after complaining, Xicomecoatl told Cortés about Moctezuma's allies and enemies, a simple description of how Tenochtitlan looked and where it was, and how the Republic of Tlaxcallan was the empire's worst enemy, alongside Huexotzinco and other places, and suggested that if he wanted to bring him down, he could try to make an alliance with those places. However, Díaz del Castillo claims that the idea of the rebellion against Moctezuma was not suggested until long after this meeting took place. Court of Cempoala, where Cortés and Xicomecoatl first met This meeting would begin an alliance between the Spanish Empire and Cempoala that would become a turning point in the conquest of the Mexica Empire, as Xicomecoatl saw the new alliance as an opportunity for the city to be liberated from the Mexica oppression, though several historians have proposed the theory that the story of the oppression was actually a lie, that Cempoala was not as oppressed as Xicomecoatl claimed, and that he claimed this so other towns and regions friendly to him could get more allies and strength, and several of these historians even propose the theory that the alliance was made for religious reasons, but this is unlikely.  The alliance  Hernán Cortés Xicomecoatl showed himself to be very friendly to the Spaniards. The morning after the meeting took place, he gave them 400 workers, or tlamemehs, to help them with any tasks they desired, which surprised the Europeans. Soon after the meeting, Cortés decided to go to the city of Quiahuiztlan. According to Francisco López de Gómara, he had planned to go to this city before he arrived at Cempoala, but he stayed in the city for 15 days. Díaz del Castillo claims this to be untrue, and that they actually went to Quiahuiztlan the day after receiving the tlamemehs from Cempoala. Whatever the case was, Cortés left Cempoala to get to Quiahuiztlan. Initially, Cortés had his concerns about Quiahuiztlan due to the powerful fortifications of the city, but once they finally arrived, they found it to be completely empty. It took a while before Cortés finally got to see some people coming out. The first people who came to see Cortés were a group of 15 noblemen, who clarified that the city was empty because most people ran away from it upon receiving the news of the arrival of the Spaniards, and would not come back until they knew who they were. After the clarification, they asked for forgiveness for not welcoming them before and made a large welcoming ceremony for them. Cortés, again, explained that they were vassals of Carlos I of Spain and gave a few gifts and jewelry to the people of the city, to which they responded by giving them food. Xicomecoatl decided to follow Cortés into the city soon after he had left Cempoala, despite not telling him about it. Cortés received the news of the incoming arrival of Xicomecoatl during the welcoming ceremony, as he was talking to the members of Quiahuiztlan's court. He arrived shortly after the Spaniards received the news, alongside many other members of Cempoala's court. Upon his arrival, he continued to show complaints about Moctezuma, to which the ruler and court of Quiahuiztlan joined in. Supposedly, the complaints were so many, Xicomecoatl actually began to tear up in anger as he was trying to speak. He claimed that Moctezuma would ask for children and young women to be sacrificed or enslaved as tribute each year, and that Moctezuma's tribute collectors would sometimes even rape their women if they found them too beautiful, according to Díaz del Castillo. Cortés attempted to calm him and the other sires down, claiming that he would make sure to protect them. City of Quiahuiztlan While the Spaniards and Totonacs from Cempoala and Quiahuiztlan were having a discussion, the news came that a group of Moctezuma's tribute collectors had arrived at Quiahuiztlan, to which the sires responded with fear. Cortés initially did not know who the men were and was confused because of the rather extreme reaction of the people upon seeing them. López de Gómara mentions 20 of them, while Díaz del Castillo mentions five, who were being escorted by people from other Totonac towns. Supposedly, they got so scared from the arrival of these men that they began to tremble. Immediately upon receiving the news, the rulers left Cortés alone and went as quickly as they could to the tribute collectors with the most valuable items they could get. Xicomecoatl and other rulers were then called upon by the collectors for an important meeting. Once they arrived to the place of the meeting, the collectors began to threaten him and the other rulers with Moctezuma's forces, claiming that Moctezuma would not accept the Spaniards being settled in his domains without his previous permission, and demanded for 20 people, men and women, to be given to them by the following morning, so they could be sacrificed to Huītzilōpōchtli, as punishment for allowing the Spaniards in without permission, according to Díaz del Castillo. Cortés decided to try to understand the situation, asking Malinche about what was going on. Once he understood, he called Xicomecoatl and the other rulers and told them that the tlatoani would not worry about him being in the territory because he was \\"friends with Moctezuma\\", and he would not be upset about the presence of the Spaniards. Later, Cortés decided to demonstrate his loyalty to Xicomecoatl and the rest of the Totonacs by ordering the arrest of the collectors to let Moctezuma know that such behavior would not be tolerated. He told Xicomecoatl about his plans, but he was very worried that if he did so, Moctezuma would attack the city, but Cortés managed to convince him and the arrest was made. All five of the collectors were arrested and brought to the court of Cempoala. According to López de Gómara, Cortés told Xicomecoatl: > \\"To show you what my men and I can do, send your men to punish and arrest > those collectors from Mexico, because I'll be here with you, and Moteczuma > won't be angry, because of my respect.\\" Upon the arrival of the prisoners, Xicomecoatl and many other members of the court suggested for all of them to be sacrificed, but Cortés told them that such measures would not be necessary, and instead, he would personally imprison them. The prisoners were then sent to one of the rooms in which the Spaniards were settled, which was used as a cell for them. Upon the arrests, Cortés ordered the people of Cempoala, Quiahuiztlan and the rest of the over 30 Totonac cities in the empire to not pay tributes to Moctezuma anymore and to begin a rebellion against him. Some court members of Cempoala continued showing concerns about the arrests, believing Moctezuma would kill them all, but he claimed that nothing would happen. The mission at first appeared to be a success, but Cortés had other plans. That same day, at midnight, Cortés made a meeting with several of his soldiers, and said, according to Díaz del Castillo: > \\"Look, free the two of them you find the most useful, and do it so that the > other indians won't notice.\\" They snuck up to the cell of two of the five prisoners, where Cortés told them that he would help them flee from their prison as long as they obeyed his orders. They agreed, and he ordered them to go back to Tenochtitlan, and tell Moctezuma that the Spaniards were not an enemy, but that they were, in fact, loyal to him and willing to become his allies. The prisoners agreed to send this message, and so, illegally, Cortés helped the prisoners flee. The following day, Xicomecoatl noticed the lack of two prisoners, which made him upset. Cortés pretended to be angered by this fact, to prevent the rise of suspicions. Upon this, Xicomecoatl suggested the rest of the prisoners to be sacrificed, but Cortés intervened again, suggesting the rest of the prisoners to be imprisoned within the Spanish ships ashore, arguing that they did not deserve to be killed because they were only following orders of the emperor. They accepted, and the prisoners were chained up and sent to the ships. Again, the prisoners did not appear the next day. The court of Cempoala told Cortés that now Moctezuma would discover the conspiracy because the prisoners managed to flee, to which he continued to respond claiming that nothing would happen. The news of the arrests of the collectors were heard in multiple places across the empire, and supposedly, it was in this moment when many Totonacs began to believe the Spaniards were gods, although it appears as though Xicomecoatl did not believe in such a thing. The arrests did, however, begin a massive alliance between the Spanish Empire and over 30 different Totonac towns across the Mexica Empire that rose up against Moctezuma, and Cortés had made his first allies for the war. However, tensions would appear between Spain and Cempoala not long after.  Tensions rise  The Tizapancinca problem = Not long after the arrests, Xicomecoatl decided to ask Cortés for a favor related to a situation of \\"great emergency\\". He told Cortés that there was a town nearby called Tizapancinca, a dangerous barbarian town filled with Mexica soldiers who were planning a conspiracy against Cortés and his men, and who had been also causing a lot of problems to the people of Cempoala, as they had ransacked the city in multiple occasions, and asked Cortés to do something about it. Cortés initially was not sure if it would be a good idea to try to invade a land he did not know anything about, but eventually said to his men, according to Díaz: > \\"You know what, men? It seems as if we are famous in this lands for our > efforts, and because of what these people saw what was done with Montezuma's > collectors, they believe we are gods or something like their idols. I > thought about how we can make them believe only one of us is needed to > defeat those indian warriors that they say are in that enemy fortress town. > Let's send Heredia the elder.\\" Using that soldier, Heredia, Cortés decided to make a demonstration of European weaponry, by taking Xicomecoatl and other members of the court to a nearby river and demonstrate how the arquebus works and how \\"they'll use it against the enemy\\", to elevate the Spanish reputation amongst the Totonacs. Once Xicomecoatl and the rest were brought, Cortés claimed that that soldier would kill all of the Mexica soldiers who were in that town. Then the gun was shot to the air, and the sires were amazed, and told other towns how they had a Teule (the word used by the Totonacs to refer to the Spaniards or gods, according to Díaz) that would destroy all of the Mexica soldiers of Tizapancinca. This likely helped elevate the reputation of the Spaniards among the Totonac people. After they came back to Cempoala, Cortés said that he would go to that town in person and help the people himself, alongside some of his soldiers, asking for some tlamemehs to help carry the guns. Two days later, Cortés marched towards Tizapancinca with 400 Spaniards and about 2000 Totonacs divided between four captains. It took two days to reach the town, but once they arrived, they did not see what they expected. According to Bernal Díaz del Castillo and various historians, once they were close to the entrance of the city, a group of eight people came out crying and begging for mercy, asking \\"Why do you want to kill us? We haven't done anything wrong.\\" They then clarified the situation, explaining that it was possible that Xicomecoatl had sent the Spaniards to the town because of conflicts they had had with Cempoala a long time ago over territorial disputes or other kinds of issues. Upon hearing this, Cortés ordered his men to stop the advance of the Totonac soldiers that were sent with them, but once they found them, they were already sacking the town. This severely angered Cortés, who called upon the captains of the Totonacs that were sent, and ordered them to return all of the stolen goods they got from the sacking, threatening them saying he would kill them all because of their acts if they did not obey. The captains asked for forgiveness, and returned all of the stolen objects they got. Cortés then apologized to the people of Tizapancinca for the trouble, asked them to never sin, and went back to Cempoala. They arrived at the city the next day, where several huts were made, and Xicomecoatl was in one of them. He offered the Spaniards food and asked for forgiveness because of the problems that occurred during their mission. He claimed that he understood he did the wrong thing by sending them to invade a peaceful town. Cortés accepted the apology and there they slept. The following morning they came back to the city. Francisco López de Gómara mentions a different version of the story. Gómara claims that as Cortés began to approach the city of Tizapancinca, many Mexica soldiers came out believing they would only fight the Totonacs, but upon seeing the Spaniards approaching, they began to run away back to their fortress, and after Cortés failed to take them out, he entered into the town by force, and as the forces from Spain and Cempoala were entering into the town, Cortés ordered that no civilians or innocents shall be killed. The forces of the town quickly surrendered and the Mexica were expelled from the place, which made the Spanish reputation even higher. After their victory, Cortés went back to Villa Rica de la Vera cruz, where he celebrated his victory. Díaz del Castillo denies such a battle taking place, openly criticizing Gómara's writings in his book: > That [story] of Cingapacinga was the first entrance that Cortés made into > New Spain, and it was not like the Chronicler Gómara said. [He said] that we > killed and captured thousands of men in Cingapacinga. And look, the curious > ones who are reading this, as well written as his chronicle is, not > everything that he writes happened as he said it did. \\"Cortés orders for the carracks to sink. Eats with Motecuhzuma's ambassadors.\\" by Juan González and Miguel González, 1698 left He sent a tribute to the king of Spain, which included multiple pieces of gold, shoes decorated with gold, silver and pearls, clothes made out of cotton with beautiful colors and paint, headdresses decorated with beautiful feathers, a pair of books (possibly referring to the Madrid Codex?), and more. The day after sending this tribute, Cortés ordered for his own ships to be destroyed, so in that way, those who did not want to follow him into Tenochtitlan would not have any other options. Cortés then came back to Cempoala, eight or ten days after sinking the ships. Whichever story is correct, tensions would continue to rise soon after Cortés returned to Cempoala. = Xicomecoatl's sexuality and the sacrifices = Most historians and chroniclers believe that Xicomecoatl did not have any women or children, but instead was openly homosexual, and had sexual relations with men, and he was not the only homosexual member of the court, as there were many others who also had sexual relations with men. In fact, homosexuality was described as being very common in Cempoala. According to the Mexican historian José Antonio Crespo, Xicomecoatl had in his court 50 men, who were around the ages of 20, and served him for his sexual pleasure. Díaz del Castillo writes: > [...] because they had men dressed up like women, who were going to gain in > that damned job, [...] and according to what we were told and got to know, > those priests were sons of sires, and did not have women, instead they had > the damned job of sodomy [...] Xicomecoatl's homosexuality was not tolerated by the catholic Spaniards, who considered it a sin. However, this was the least of their concerns. Chroniclers like Bernal Díaz del Castillo and others describe that human sacrifices were highly common in Cempoala: > [...] and everyday, they sacrificed three, four or five indians in front of > us, and the hearts were offered to their idols, their blood plastered over > the walls, and they cut off the legs, arms and thighs [...] Díaz also claims that cannibalism was common in Cempoala too, and even says that he thinks he remembers how human flesh was sold in markets as steaks. The Spaniards described being horrified by these practices, and Cortés would try to stop them. = Desecration of the temples = When Cortés returned to Cempoala, according to Díaz del Castillo, some of the city's noblemen told Cortés that they did not want the Spaniards to leave, as they feared what Moctezuma would do to them without his protection. Therefore, to legitimize their alliance, Cortés suggested that the Spanish captains should now marry noblewomen of the city, to consider their alliance not only as a friendship, but a legitimate brotherhood. The people accepted, and Xicomecoatl offered eight women to the Spaniards, two of which were relative to him: one of the women, later baptized with the name Doña Catalina, was Xicomecoatl's niece, and the other, later baptized with the name Doña Francisca, was the daughter of Xicomecoatl's nephew, Cuesco. Xicomecoatl offered the women, and told Cortés, according to Díaz del Castillo: > \\"Sir, these seven women are for your captains, and this, my own niece, is > for you. She's the ruler of regions and vassals.\\" Cortés gladly accepted the women, but told Xicomecoatl that if they truly wanted to consider them their wives, they had to convert to Christianity and abandon their indigenous practices; and for their alliance to truly be a brotherhood, they had to stop the human sacrifices, prohibit sodomy, stop worshipping their gods and abandon the Aztec religion as a whole. If they did so, they would even give them Spanish provinces and lands. However, they refused to do so, arguing that the gods were the ones who brought happiness, health and well-being to everybody, and if they stopped the sacrifices and worship, a catastrophe worse than any sacrifice they could make would occur. Cortés, upon receiving this answer, began to speak to his men: > And after Cortés and all of us got such a loathed answer, and we had seen so > much cruelty and foolishness, as I had mentioned before, we couldn't suffer > them anymore. And then Cortés began to talk to us about it, and reminded us > about good doctrines, and how could we do anything well without doing it in > God's honour, and without removing the sacrifices they make for their idols? Templo de las Chimeneas, main temple of Cempoala The Spaniards then decided to begin the destruction of the representations of the Aztec gods right in that moment. The Spaniards got their weapons and armor. Cortés gave the people of Cempoala an ultimatum, claiming that the idols must be destroyed. Xicomecoatl reacted instantly and sent his soldiers to the main square of the city to protect the temples. The Spaniards were now planning to get to the main temple of the city, which would prove to be difficult for them due to its height and fortifications. Xicomecoatl attempted to convince Cortés to stop, telling him that he understands his intentions, but that if they stop praising their gods everyone shall perish, including the Spaniards. Cortés reacted violently to this claim, yelling that he had already ordered them to stop sacrificing people before, and that they were being fooled into sacrificing people for their idols, and ordered them to remove them themselves, otherwise the Spaniards would do it instead, and also began to shout threats, claiming that he would kill all of the soldiers who were in the temple if they did not get out of the way. The soldiers of Cempoala, tired of the Spanish threats, finally told the Spaniards that they were not worthy of the gods, and therefore they could destroy those representations if they really wanted to, but it would not be with their consent. Upon hearing this, the Spaniards immediately rushed into the temple and began to destroy as many statues as they could find in it, throwing them down the stairs of the building as they crumbled. Many of the devout Totonacs and priests who were watching the scene closed their eyes or started to cry, praying to the gods for forgiveness for allowing the destruction to happen. After a while, multiple soldiers got outside of the temple and got prepared to shoot their arrows and throw their spears at the Spaniards, preparing to fight and kill them. Upon seeing this, Cortés immediately rushed to get to Xicomecoatl, and he was told that if he did not order his soldiers to not shoot, he would kill him and everyone else around him. Xicomecoatl got up as soon as possible and ran in front of the soldiers, ordering them to not shoot or kill the Spaniards. The soldiers obeyed him and stopped the attack. After this, Cortés decided to try to make peace again.  Peace restored  Fray Bartolomé de Olmedo baptizing the eight women offered by Xicomecoatl. Miguel González, 1696 or 1715 The following morning, Cortés ordered for the pieces of the crumbled statues to be burned and buried in \\"a place where they won't be found again\\". Some Totonac people began to take the rest of the representations of the gods away from the temple. Cortés now claimed that Cempoala and Spain were officially allied as a brotherhood, and the rebellion against Moctezuma would be a success. He ordered for a representation of Mary, mother of Jesus, to be placed in the main temple, for all the blood in the temples to be cleaned, and for a wooden cross to be built in the main square. He also ordered the temple to be coverted into a catholic church, and for four priests to work for the church, under the supervision of a Spanish soldier named Juan de Torres de Córdova, and for an altar to be made. The next day, Fray Bartolomé de Olmedo did mass in the city, where the eight women previously offered by XIcomecoatl were baptized and given to the Spanish military captains. This would be the end of the conflicts between Cortés and Xicomecoatl, but it would not be the last conflict Cempoala would face. Cortés left Cempoala to go to Tenochtitlan a few days after peace was restored. He asked him to take good care of the church and cross that were left in the city, and asked for 200 tlamamehs and 50 captains to defend himself during the travel to Tenochtitlan. He initially had planned to go directly to Tenochtitlan, and had been told to not go to Tlaxcallan by Moctezuma's ambassadors earlier, but XIcomecoatl and other members of the court suggested him to not listen to those ambassadors, since he could make an alliance with them to help with the rebellion. Cortés listened to this suggestion instead, and he left in August 1519. The women he had offered to them had to stay, as the Spaniards did not want them to be in danger during battles. Throughout the following months, Cortés sent several gifts to Xicomecoatl, such as clothes and a few pieces of gold.  Mexica attack on the Totonacs and Spaniards  \\"Receiving of Motecuhzuma. Mexican dances in canoes in the lake\\" by Juan González and Miguel González, 1698 Repeatedly, multiple Mexica regions sent threats to the people of Cempoala and other Totonacs for their rebellion against Moctezuma. Cortés always claimed everything would be fine as long as the Spaniards were there. Xicomecoatl always expressed his concerns, despite being highly supportive of Cortés. On 8 November 1519, Cortés arrived at Tenochtitlan, along with about 400 soldiers from Cempoala a few thousands more from Tlaxcallan, and got to meet Moctezuma II for the first time. Cortés was received with many honours and a large welcoming ceremony, which was described to have lasted for more than an hour. > Another day after I arrived at this city [of Iztapalapa], I left, and after > walking half a league, I entered through a road in the middle of that lake I > mentioned, two leagues until arriving in the great city of Temixtitan , > which was founded in the middle of that lake, [...] Here, up to a thousand > principal men, citizens of this city, came out to see me and speak to me, > all dressed up in a very rich manner, according to their customs, and they > came out to speak to me one by one. They came to me with a ceremony they use > a lot between each other, in which they place their hand on the floor and > kiss it, and I stood there waiting for nearly an hour until everyone > finished their ceremony. [...] After crossing over the bridge, that sire > Mutezuma came out to receive us with up to two hundred men, all barefoot and > dressed up in another very rich manner for their customs. Moctezuma received Cortés with many honours and allowed them to reside in the city, but only six days after his arrival, Cortés ordered for him to be imprisoned. Cortés claimed that the arrest was made due to an attack against Totonac and Spanish men which occurred in the province of Nautla shortly after arriving in the city. A Spanish captain, Juan de Escalante, the main captain of Veracruz, had been killed by a Mexica general and local tribute collector, Qualpopoca, alongside several men. López de Gómara claims that nine Spaniards were killed, while Díaz del Castillo and Cortés claimed that seven, including Escalante, were killed. Earlier, Escalante had been ordered to protect Veracruz and the rest of the allied Totonac regions from any danger. The battle went as follows, according to Díaz: the attack occurred as the result of the rebellion against Moctezuma that had begun earlier. Qualpopoca, a tribute collector of Nautla, a Totonac province under the rule of the empire referred to as Almería by the Spaniards, ordered for the Totonacs of Tuxpan to give tribute to Moctezuma, but they refused to do so, arguing they had been told by Cortés that Moctezuma did not have an issue with the lack of tributes. Qualpopoca was angered by this response, and began to send threats to the people of the region, claiming that they would destroy their city and kill everyone if they did not obey. Escalante eventually received the news of the recent threats on his allies, so he decided to send a group of messengers to tell him that Moctezuma was not bothered by the lack of tributes, and the issue could be solved without violence. However, Qualpopoca did not listen to this argument, and challenged Escalante to a battle. According to Cortés, Escalante sent four messengers specifically. Two of them died and the other two disappeared. He claimed that Qualpopoca had killed them all and then made it look like an accident. Escalante prepared for the attack with two cannons, two arquebuses, three crossbows, 40 Spaniards and about 2,000 Totonacs. They eventually found Qualpopoca and his troops sacking a city. Escalante quickly was overwhelmed by Qualpopoca's force, after most of the Totonacs soldiers he had brought ran away in fear of the Mexica, after they began to shoot arrows at them, leaving the Spanish mostly alone in the fight. Escalante attempted to use all the gunpowder he had by firing from the arquebuses and cannons as much as possible in an attempt to scare the Mexica away. Eventually, Escalante managed to get to Almería, where he burned down the town. However, by this time, his forces had been severely weakened; he had been fatally wounded during the fight, he was beginning to run out of gunpowder, a horse had been killed and one of his soldiers, Argüello de León, was captured by the Mexica and was later beheaded for sacrifice. Escalante returned to Veracruz, where he and six wounded Spanish soldiers died shortly after. Upon receiving the news of the battle, Xicomecoatl became very worried. This was the first time he had heard about the Spanish being defeated or weakened by the Mexica, and the Totonacs began to be concerned about the rebellion, as it appeared to be less likely for Cortés to fulfill his promises of protection. Because of this, he decided to prohibit the Spaniards from entering into Cempoala until the issue with the tribute collectors had been resolved. This worried the Spanish greatly, claiming that they did not know what to do, so they decided to send a message to Cortés by sending a letter to Tlaxcallan. Pedro de Hircia, one of the soldiers, was the one who wrote the letter and sent it. Once they received the letter, the Tlaxcalans sent a pair of spies to give the letter to Cortés while in Tenochtitlan. Cortés received this letter on the morning of 14 November; therefore he told Moctezuma about the incident, and consequently was arrested for it. According to Gómara, Cortés had been planning to make an excuse to imprison Moctezuma so he could conquer the empire, possibly before he got to meet him, and used the story of the attack on Escalante to commit this act, though Cortés claims he did not plan to arrest Moctezuma until he heard about the attack, though he did have the intention of turning Tenochtitlan into a subject of the Spanish Empire. Upon the arrest, Moctezuma claimed that he did not know about the atrocity that had happened in the region, and allowed Cortés to capture and punish Qualpopoca for what he did. About 20 days after this, Qualpopoca was captured and executed for his crimes against the Totonac and Spanish of that area. Before the execution, Cortés interrogated Qualpopoca, asking him if he was a vassal for Moctezuma, to which he responded sarcastically: > \\"Is there any other lord I can be a vassal for?\\" Then he confessed that Moctezuma was innocent, and was not informed or gave permission for the attack. After this confession, he was burned to death, but Moctezuma continued to be imprisoned afterwards, though he was granted more rights and privileges as time went on.  Battle of Cempoala  However, what Xicomecoatl did not know is that Cortés was in trouble with the Governorate of Cuba. Previously in that year, the governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, had ordered the arrest of Cortés after he set sail for the Yucatán Peninsula without his permission, and in March 1520, he had sent another Spanish captain to capture him, that man being Pánfilo de Narváez. He arrived with 19 ships, carrying between 600 and 800 Spanish soldiers, around 1000 indigenous people from Cuba, about 10 artillery pieces, 80 rifles and 80 horses for the expedition. However, 50 men died before arriving at Mexico due to several storms, which caused the sinking of six ships. Narváez arrived 22 April, and decided to go to the city of Cempoala and install himself in a camp. Narváez repeatedly claimed that Cortés was nothing but a liar and criminal who would betray the people of Mexico as soon as he got what he wanted. He also began to send messages to Moctezuma, claiming that Cortés was planning to kill him and take the empire for himself. Supposedly, many did believe Narváez and began to doubt Hernán's intentions, specially since Narváez was also a Spaniard. However, Xicomecoatl stayed loyal to Cortés, claiming that he was not the type of person who would betray someone he was allied to. According to Díaz del Castillo and Cortés, once Pánfilo arrived, he sacked the court, stealing Hernán's gifts and kidnapping the women who had been offered to his men. Xicomecoatl tried to stop him, stating that Cortés would kill him the moment he knew about what he was doing. Narváez ignored this and continued. Cortés, who was still in Tenochtitlan, upon receiving the news of Narváez being in Cempoala, decided to return to the city to defeat him, and left the troops that stayed in Tenochtitlan in charge of one of his soldiers, Pedro de Alvarado. The battle began in the night of 27 May 1520, but his force was small in comparison to Pánfilo's, only having 266 Spaniards and a few natives. According to Díaz, Cortés, after arriving at Cempoala, ordered the capture of artillery weapons of Narváez, capturing 18 cannonballs. The mission was led by a captain named Pizarro (not to be confused with Francisco Pizarro). Cortés found out Narváez was in one of the temples of the city thanks to a captured spy, Gonzalo Carrasco, so he ordered one of his captains, Gonzalo de Sandoval, with around 40 men, to capture him, and to kill him if necessary. This would be a dangerous task, due to the height of the temple, and the protection of it from other temples with soldiers in them. Some tried to warn Narváez about Cortés going to the city, including Gonzalo, but at first, he did not believe the warnings about Hernán's arrival, believing that he would not be willing to actually go to war with him just because \\"a fat indian\\" asked him to do it. Pánflo's troops failed to notice Cortés earlier due to the heavy rain of that night, but as soon as Pánfilo's soldiers noticed Hernán's troops approaching, they immediately warned Narváez about it. As soon as Pánfilo received the news, he ordered for cannons to be shot at Hernán's troops, but they only had time to fire four times, out of which only one shot managed to hit the troops, killing three men, according to Díaz, though Cortés claimed this shot only killed two. Many horsemen attempted to charge against Pizarro's troops, but failed to push them back. Six or seven horsemen were defeated. Narváez then ordered his riflemen to fire upon Pizarro's squadron, wounding seven men. Pánfilo de NarváezSandoval managed to successfully get to the temple where Narváez was settled, forcing him to divide his troops to fire against Sandoval's soldiers. It was then when the captured artillery was aimed towards the temple, forcing Narváez to get down from it. Hernán's pikemen rushed in to fight against the last remaining troops of Narváez. The battle ended after some of Pánfilo's most important soldiers, like his second lieutenant, Fulano de Fuentes, and a captain, Rojas de Castilla la Vieja, were killed, and when Pánfilo de Narváez was stabbed in eye by one of Hernán's pikemen, leaving him badly wounded. He was captured soon after. During the battle, Xicomecoatl was stabbed by a soldier of Narváez as he was trying to hide in his palace. He was found after the battle ended, and Cortés, upon being notified about it, ordered for him to be taken to his room immediately for his wounds to be cured. After Pánfilo's capture, he was held prisoner in Veracruz for two years for his crimes against the people of Cempoala. He was sent back to Cuba afterwards. Cortés then convinced the remaining troops of Narváez to join him and go to Tenochtitlan. Smallpox affecting people in Mexico. Florentine Codex. Despite being largely outnumbered, the battle was a success for Cortés, but it would have unexpected consecuences. During his absence, Pedro de Alvarado had ordered a massacre of civilians in Tenochtitlan, disobeying Cortés. This atrocity would lead to the Battle of La Noche Triste taking place, in 30 June 1520. Also, it turned out that one of Pánfilo's men had contracted smallpox before arriving at Mexico. During the battle, some of Hernán's men contracted the disease and carried it unintentionally to Tenochtitlan, leading to the deaths of millions of people in the consequent pandemic.  Later in the war  Xicomecoatl survived from his wounds and continued to support Cortés after the battle, sending reinforcements and support to Cortés after Noche Triste and the Battle of Otumba, upon receiving the news about the heavy casualties suffered by the Spaniards as the result of those battles. His alliance became one of the most important ones throughout the course of the war, as it led to Cortés knowing more about the land he was in, about the empire's enemies he could make alliances with, and offering multiple soldiers who protected him during his battles against Tlaxcallan, Cuba and other places. Facts such as when he died or what happened to him after the conquest are unknown.

On May 14, 2017, after North Korea performed a ballistic missile test, Haley said Kim was \\"in a state of paranoia\\" after feeling pressure from the U.S. On June 2, 2017, after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution adding fifteen North Koreans and four entities linked to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs to a sanctions blacklist, Haley said the council's vote was \\"sending a clear message to North Korea today: Stop firing ballistic missiles or face the consequences\\". On July 5, 2017, during a U.N. Security Council meeting, in response to North Korea launching an intercontinental ballistic missile, Haley announced the US would within days \\"bring before the Security Council a resolution that raises the international response in a way that is proportionate to North Korea's new escalation\\". The following month the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved sanctions on North Korea banning exports worth over $1 billion. Haley said that the sanctions package was \\"the single largest ... ever leveled against the North Korean regime\\".  Russia  On February 2, 2017, Haley declared to the U.N. Security Council that sanctions against Russia for its Crimean conflict would not be lifted until Russia returned control over the region to Ukraine. On June 4, 2017, Haley reported the United States would retain \\"sanctions strong and tough when it comes to the issue in Ukraine\\".  Syria  On March 30, 2017, Haley stated that the U.S. would no longer focus on forcing Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to leave power. This was a policy shift from former president Barack Obama's initial stance on Assad. On April 5, speaking to the U.N. Security Council a day after the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Haley said Russia, Assad, and Iran \\"have no interest in peace\\" and attacks similar to this would continue occurring should nothing be done in response. A day later, the U.S. launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles toward the Shayrat Air Base in Syria. Haley called the strike a \\"very measured step\\" and warned that the U.S. was prepared \\"to do more\\" despite wishing it would not be required. On April 12, after Russia blocked a draft resolution meant to condemn the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Haley criticized Russia, saying \\"We need to see Russia choose to side with the civilized world over an Assad government that brutally terrorizes its own people.\\" June 28, while appearing before the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Haley credited President Trump's warning to Syria with stopping another chemical attack: \\"I can tell you due to the president's actions, we did not see an incident.\\"  Social policy = Abortion  Haley describes herself as pro-life and has supported legislation to restrict abortion. She has stated \\"I'm not pro-life because the Republican Party tells me, I'm pro-life because all of us have had experiences of what it means to have one of these special little ones in our life.\\" Haley has consistently supported bills that give rights to a fetus and restrict abortion, except when the mother's life is at risk. In 2006, as a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, Haley voted for the Penalties for Harming an Unborn Child/Fetus law, which asserted that an act of violence against a fetus is akin to a criminal act against the mother. She also voted for two separate bills that required a woman to first look at an ultrasound and then wait 24 hours before being permitted to have an abortion. In 2016, she re-signed a new state law that bans abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy. Haley has voted in favor of some bills relating to abortion that were tabled or rejected, including the Inclusion of Unborn Child/Fetus in Definition for Civil Suits Amendment, Prohibiting Employment Termination Due to Abortion Waiting Period amendment, and Exempting Cases of Rape from Abortion Waiting Period amendment. The latter would have allowed specific cases of women to not have to wait the mandatory 24 hours before having an abortion.  Death penalty  In regard to the state trial of Dylann Roof, Haley urged prosecutors to seek the death penalty against him. In October 2017, the U.S., along with 13 other nations, voted against a U.N. resolution titled \\"The Question of the Death Penalty\\", which condemned the use of capital punishment when \\"applied arbitrarily or in a discriminatory manner\\" and specifically condemned \\"the imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.\\" LGBTQ rights advocates in the U.S., including the Human Rights Campaign, were critical of the vote. After the vote, a State Department spokeswoman announced that \\"We voted against that resolution because of broader concerns with the resolution's approach in condemning the death penalty in all circumstances ... The United States unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality, blasphemy, adultery, and apostasy. We do not consider such conduct appropriate for criminalization.\\"  LGBT issues  In April 2016, Haley indicated she would not support legislation introduced by the South Carolina State Senate which would require transgender individuals to use restrooms based on biological sex instead of gender identity. Haley stated: > These are not instances that ... y'all haven't reported on anything. I > haven't heard anything that's come to my office. So when I look at South > Carolina, we look at our situations, we're not hearing of anybody's > religious liberties that are being violated, and we're, again, not hearing > any citizens that feel like they are being violated in terms of freedoms. Haley described such restroom legislation as unnecessary. In April 2017, Haley spoke out against Ramzan Kadyrov and the abuse and murder of gay men in Chechnya. She stated that \\"We continue to be disturbed by reports of kidnapping, torture, and murder of people in Chechnya based on their sexual orientation ... this violation of human rights cannot be ignored\\".  Immigration  Haley has stated that, as a daughter of immigrants, she believes the immigration laws should be enforced. She voted in favor of a law that requires employers to be able to prove that newly hired employees are legal residents of the United States, and also requires all immigrants to carry documentation at all times proving that they are legally in the United States. Haley signed an \\"Arizona-style\\" law cracking down on illegal immigration in June 2011. The law is the subject of a lawsuit initiated by the United States Justice Department on numerous grounds, including claims the immigration law violates the Supremacy Clause. Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for Haley, said, \\"If the feds were doing their job, we wouldn't have had to address illegal immigration reform at the state level. But, until they do, we're going to keep fighting in South Carolina to be able to enforce our laws.\\" On March 15, 2017, Haley said she would not support a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States should President Trump choose to enact one. Haley said she did not believe \\"we should ever ban anyone based on their religion\\" and that a Muslim ban would be \\"un-American\\".  Voter ID laws  Haley supports Voter ID laws, laws requiring photo identification at the polls.

Whenever I want to grab it, it escapes from one place to another.\\" He was praised by Taj al-Din al-Subki, Al-Safadi, Shihab al-Din al-'Umari, Shams al-Din ibn al-Ghazzi, and 'Abd al- Hayy al-Hasani.  Biography  Safi al-Din al-Hindi was born in Delhi and completed his Islamic education there before settling in Damascus.https://www.newageislam.com/indian-muslim-scholars-from-shah-wali- allah-to-allama-iqbal-have-offered-mixed-praise-for-ibn-taymiyyahs- personality-and-works/islamic-personalities/d/115443 He visited Egypt and moved to Turkey, where he stayed for eleven years; five in Konya, five in Sivas, and one in Kayseri. He arrived in Damascus in the second half of the 13th century and stayed there until he died. Safi al-Din al-Hindi studied under Siraj al-Din al-Urmawi and was said to have indirectly begun his studies with Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, whom he met through his maternal grandfather. He was the teacher of mutakallim (theologian) Sadr al-Din ibn al-Wakil (d. 1317) and Kamal al-Din ibn al-Zamalkani (d. 1327). His students and he, Ibn al-Wakil and Ibn al-Zamalkani, had been directly involved in Ibn Taymiyyah's famous 1306 Damascene trials, which were addressed to restrain Ibn Taymiyyah's relentless anti-Ash'ari polemics.

It contains lists of the Abbasid caliphs for 785–813 and the Syriac Orthodox patriarchs for 788–819. Authorship and transmission The Chronicle was discovered in a large 9th-century codex unearthed by Aphrem Barsaum in the village of Basabrina in 1911. A search for the codex could not locate it in 1984, and it seems likely that it was destroyed during the Assyrian genocide in 1915. A transcription of the chronicle made by Barsaum may still be kept somewhere in France. According to a marginal notice, the codex was copied by one Severus for his uncle David, bishop of Ḥarrān. This David was a former monk of Qarṭmin who is known to have been consecrated as a bishop by Patriarch John IV of Antioch between 846 and 873. The codex also contains church canons and patriarchal letters. The Chronicle appears as a \\"self-contained collection of historical notices\\". A later hand added a historical notice of the drought of 1094–95, which places the manuscript in Basabrina by that date. The Chronicle of 819 was incorporated almost in its entirety into the Chronicle of 846. It is the later chronicle's main source for the Islamic period. The Chronicle of 819 may be the work of up to three authors, with changes in authorship coinciding with the periods 728–733 and 775–785. The signs of Qarṭminite authorship in the work are extensive and conclusive. Out of 125 entries, 15 mention the monastery. In 1959, the Syriac Orthodox patriarch Philoxenus Dolabani claimed without citing his source that the chronicle was the work of the \\"renowned scribe\\" Manṣur, abbot of Qarṭmin and son of Marzuq, a priest of Basabrina. This appears to have been a mere conjecture. Sources and content The Chronicle gives roughly even coverage of ecclesiastical and secular events. For the early period, its main source is the Chronicle of Edessa, which ends in 540. It also includes material from Eusebius of Caesarea. Of the 74 entries before this year, the Chronicle of Edessa is the source for 62. Its information is not passed on verbatim, but is often abbreviated and in some cases modified, as when the Chronicle of 819 labels Ibas of Edessa a heretic. For the 7th and 8th centuries, it relies heavily on the archives of the monastery of Qarṭmin. These centuries take up about half the length of the chronicle. The other sources for the later centuries are less clear, but may include the lost chronicle of Jacob of Edessa (died 708), which was known at Qarṭmin. John of Ephesus' biography of Jacob Baradaeus was also used as a source. The Chronicle's coverage of political affairs, including military encounters between the Abbasids and the Romans (Byzantines), between 762 and 819 is especially valuable. The chronicle is unique among Syriac histories in completely ignoring the reign of the Roman emperor Heraclius. From the 7th century on it does not document the succession of Roman emperors and focuses exclusively on the caliphs. It does not mention the caliphs Yazīd III and Ibrāhīm ibn al-Walīd, who ruled briefly in 744, because they were not recognized in Upper Mesopotamia. The last event recorded is the consecration as patriarch of Dionysius of Tel Maḥre, which is dated to 819 although it actually took place in August 818. The chronicle was probably completed shortly after this at Qarṭmin, as it contains more information about that monastery than any other chronicle.

He served as Admiral of the Realm from 1610. He was the father of Corfitz Ulfeldt. Early life Ulfeldt was born at Selsø Manor, the son of Jakob Ulfeldt (d. 1593) and Anne Jakobsdatter Flemming (1544–70). He was the elder brother of Jacob Ulfeldt. Mogens Ulfeldt studied in Wittenberg (1582–86), Jena (1583) and Leipzig. Soon after his return to Denmark, he went on another journey to Austria, Hungary and Italy. He studied at the universities of Padua (1587) and Siena (1588) before continuing to Malta where he participated in the Order of Malta's battles against the Turks. Career Back in Denmark, Ulfeldt served as hofjunker in 1590–94. A favourite of the young Christian IV, in 1599 he was appointed vice captain of the king's ship on an expedition to the Arctic Sea. The following year, he was granted Kronborg as a fief. In 1604, Kronborg was exchanged for Kristianopel and Sølvitsborg. In 1602, Ulfeldt was appointed admiral of a fleet to Narva. In 1606, with the title of vice admiral, he participated on the king's voyage to England. In 1609–10, he was commander of the flotilla that defended the Danish dominium maris baltici and successfully terminated the Swedish blockade of Riga. In March 1610, Ulfeldt was made a member of the Privy Council and appointed an Admiral of the Realm. He was granted Villands Herred as a replacement of his earlier fiefs in the same year. In February 1611, he was probably part of the Privy Council majority that condoled Christian IV's decision to declare war against Sweden. In March through September, he served as commander of a Danish fleet that operated at Kalmar and Gotland. In June 1612, Ulfeldt and Gert Rantzau gained control of Öland. In the autumn, he headed the Danish fleet under Christian IV's command. In late 1612, he acquired the fief of Tranekær in exchange for Villands Herred. Property Ulfeldt inherited Selsø, Tvis Kloster and Krogsdal in Western Jutland. Personal life On 7 August 1597, Ulfeldt was married to Anne Munk, a daughter of Christen Munk (c. 1520–79) and Dorthe Gyldenstierne (d. 1583). They had four children (1616–24): Corfitz Ulfeldt, Jacob Ulfeldt, Christian Ulfeldt and Anne Ulfeldt. An \\"action by his wife\\" prompted Ulfeldt to imprison her at Selsø Castle, with the king's permission. She was not given her full freedom until 1624. Ulfeldt fell ill and died in 1616.

The store was founded in 1975 as a feminist bookstore and was named after Virginia Woolf's 1929 essay of the same name. Celebrating reading with its motto of \\"Eat, sleep, read,\\" A Room of One's Own carries a broad selection of books, with a focus on works by women and non- binary people and the LGBT community. Description A Room of One's Own specializes in areas such as feminism and gender studies, providing literature for, by and about women, non-binary people, and queer people. With a move to a larger space in 2011, the bookstore broadened its offerings, providing more selection in fiction, children's books, and local history. The store carries around 200,000 titles, with annual sales over one million dollars. Featuring a robust schedule of author talks and book readings, the store also offers free space for community meetings and events. A Room of One's Own partners with organizations such as the Wisconsin Book Festival. History A Room of One's Own was started in 1975 by a group of five women who had recently finished their degrees at the University of Wisconsin: Sandi Torkildson, Moe Doe, Susan Ketchum, Gail Straw, and Sally Stevens. They raised $5,000 to build the store and gathered support from other feminist bookstores in the U.S. The original location was an old printing office at 317 West Johnson Street. In 1997 the store moved two doors down to 307 West Johnson Street; in 2011 the store relocated to its current location on Gorham Street, moving into the 6,000 square foot space formerly housing Avol's Books (and, prior to that, Canterbury Books). Owners Sandi Torkildson and Nancy Geary put A Room of One's Own up for sale in June 2016, and in June 2018 they announced the store would be purchased by three partners: two current employees, Gretchen Treu and Jes Lukes, as well as fantasy novelist Patrick Rothfuss. The #BookstoresAgainstBorders campaign was organized by the owners and staff of A Room of One's Own, donating part of their July 2019 sales to nonprofit organization Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, supporting legal services for immigrants. More than 90 bookstores and publishers across the United States participated in the fundraising campaign.

It granted pardons to those who violated the Military Selective Service Act during the Vietnam War era, from August 4, 1964 to March 28, 1973. It was implemented through Executive Order 11967. Context During the Vietnam War, hundreds of thousands of American men evaded the draft by fleeing the country or failing to register with their local draft board. President Gerald Ford signed a proclamation in 1974 that granted conditional amnesty to draft evaders, provided they work in a public service job for up to two years. Draft evaders who had done so by leaving the country were not eligible for a conditional pardon. Up to 90% of evaders had fled to Canada, with up to 50,000 settling there permanently. Jimmy Carter promised during his presidential campaign that he would pardon draft evaders of the Vietnam War, calling it the \\"single hardest decision\\" of his campaign. He signed the proclamation on January 21, 1977, his first full day in office. The proclamation did not offer amnesty to deserters, however. Reception Barry Goldwater, a supporter of the Vietnam War, referred to the proclamation as \\"the most disgraceful thing that a president has ever done\\". Carter was accused of showing favoritism towards middle-class evaders who were able to successfully stay out of the war. Some veterans of the war were opposed to amnesty for evaders, while anti- war activists said it fell short by not pardoning deserters.

The fire was the largest of many small fires started by a lightning storm and was first reported on June 14, 2020. The East Canyon Fire burned and was contained on June 27, 2020. The fire resulted in the closure a portion of Highway 160 and mandatory evacuations of a campground and residences in the area. Events The East Canyon Fire was first reported on June 14, 2020, around 12:41 PM, on a ridge east of Menefee Peak, owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), near Mancos, Colorado. The fire was started by a lightning strike, from a large lightning storm, in a pinyon- juniper forest on a mesa surrounded by numerous canyons. Fueled by pinyon- juniper, Gamble oak, and grass, the fire is burning in a hard area to reach, requiring fire crews to use aircraft to fight the fire. By the evening the fire had grown to , burning on both BLM and private land in La Plata and Montezuma Counties, specifically on the east side of Weber Canyon and the west side of Cherry Creek. Fire crews focused on keeping the fire east of Highway 46, where it threatened two subdivisions, south of Highway 160, and west of County Road 105. As a result, fifteen homes and the Target Tree Campground were placed under mandatory evacuation. By the next day, June 15, Red Flag warnings were in place and crews began to secure the western area of the fire, protecting a radio tower and two nearby homes. Due to high winds, the fire moved down the east side of Weber Mountain. In the afternoon, the fire pushed towards Highway 160. It burned one mile south of the highway, resulting in the highway being closed. A Temporary Flight Restriction was also put in place for 10 miles around the fire. As of the evening of June 16, the fire had burned and crews had reached five percent containment and made significant progress with dozer lines and fire retardant drops. However, the fire kept moving down small canyons and began breaching retardant lines. Two privately owned pieces of equipment and a small privately owned bridge burned. A bear with badly burned feet was tranquilized and transported to a rehab facility. Two days later, on June 18, the BLM reported that the fire was back to zero containment. The next day, June 19, they reported it was 17 percent contained. This progress was due to light favorable wind conditions. On June 22, all evacuation orders were lifted and all sides of the fire, except the northwest flank, were contained. The fire was contained by June 27, 2020. It burned a total of .

Personal life  Mariana Zuvic was born in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz in 1974. Her father, Ángel Miguel Zuvic, was a pianist and businessman who had presided the Chamber of Commerce of the Santa Cruz province. She attended public elementary and secondary schools in Santa Cruz before enrolling in Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona to study political science. She and Argentine businessman and Santa Cruz senator Eduardo Raúl Costa [es] lived together as romantic partners for 12 years before separating in 2019, with Zuvic citing \\"economic violence\\" as the reason. They have two children. Despite being referred to as Costa's wife, Zuvic said that she was not married. In an interview with La Voz, Zuvic claimed that her family had been bullied by former presidents Néstor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, so much so that her father, who committed suicide in 2019, went deaf after a fight with Néstor.  Political career  Zuvic entered politics in 2007 and, with the help of Civic Coalition ARI leader Elisa Carrió, founded the Santa Cruz faction of the party to offer an alternative to Néstor Kirchner's corrupt governance, which had ruled the province for more than two decades. She spent much of her career uncovering the Kirchners' corruption in her native Santa Cruz. In 2018, Zuvic published her debut book The Origin: An intimate history of the making of Néstor and Cristina Kirchner as Santa Cruz politicians (El origen: Historia íntima del nacimiento de Néstor y Cristina en Santa Cruz como políticos), in which she revealed the \\"institutional destruction, social decomposition, and corruption\\" that the presidential couple had inflicted on her native Santa Cruz in first- person narrative. She is a close friend of Argentine lawmaker Elisa Carrió, who Zuvic said had been influential in the formative years of her political career.

He is a Full Professor of Dermatological Science at University College Dublin and the Director of the Charles Institute of Dermatology. He was Chair of British Society for Investigative Dermatology from 2018 to 2020. Tobin is a fellow of The Royal College of Pathologists, of the Higher Education Academy, of the Royal Society of Biology, Institute of Biomedical Science, and of the Institute of Trichologists (where he is currently vice-president). Tobin's research is focused on pigmentation and hair follicle health. He has conducted extensive research on Alopecia areata, where he was the first researcher to show that patients with AA have circulating antibodies to hair follicle- specific antigens, including trichohyalin.  Education  A native of Navan, County Meath, Ireland, Tobin completed high school education at St Patrick’s Classical School, Navan, and was awarded a B.Sc. from Maynooth University in 1986. Tobin then joined North East Surrey College of Technology where he completed his G.I. in Biology (immunology) in 1987. In 1991, he received his Ph.D. from the University of London (St John’s Institute of Dermatology). Subsequently he moved to the United States, where he completed his research post-doctoral training at the Dept. of Dermatology NYU, New York.  Career  Tobin briefly worked as Assistant Research Professor at the Department of Dermatology, New York University and Adjunct Assistant Professor at City University of New York before moving back to the Europe in 1996. There he joined University of Bradford as a lecturer in Biomedical Sciences. He moved up in the ranks becoming a Full Professor in 2004. From 2005 to 2008, he served as the Director of the Medical Biosciences Research Group. In 2008, he was appointed the Associate Dean for Research and Knowledge Transfer at the Faculty of Life Sciences. Tobin founded the Center for Skin Sciences at University of Bradford in 2009 and served as its Director until 2018. In 2018, he left University of Bradford to return home to Ireland to join the University College Dublin, where he was appointed the Director of Charles Institute of Dermatology. In 2018, Tobin was appointed the Chair of British Society for Investigative Dermatology.  Research and work = Pigmentation & neuroendocrine research  Tobin’s lab developed an assay for tracking melanin transfer events, followed by a study on a key motor protein to drive melanin transfer between melanocytes and keratinocytes in human skin. These latter findings were translated in product development for pigmentation spots and potentially also melasma. Via university-owned IP, his team discovered a potential new ‘sun-less tanning’ small peptide technology. Tobin identified the basis for the clinically-observed preferential targeting of pigmented hair (and relative sparing of white hair) in Alopecia areata (AA), with his data showing that pigmented hair follicle melanocytes are destroyed in acute AA. This also explains rapid so-called ‘going white overnight’. Tobin's laboratory was the first to report that the opioid b-endorphin acts a surprising and potent pigmentary molecule. Tobin’s work is also interested in the life and death of pigment cells; key not only for those with age-related loss of hair pigmentation, but also for those with malignant pigment cells. He reported the first recognized spontaneous and cyclical programmed cell death in the melanocyte system in humans, during the regression phase of the hair growth cycle. This may be harnessed in apoptosis-resistant malignant melanoma.Tobin, D. J., Hagen, E., Botchkarev, V. A., & Paus, R. (1998). Do Hair Bulb Melanocytes Undergo Apotosis During Hair Follicle Regression (Catagen)? Journal of Investigative Dermatology, 111(6), 941-947. doi:10.1046/j.1523-1747.1998.00417.x With vitiligo, he and his colleagues challenged the prevailing view that all melanocytes were lost/destroyed in epidermis of patients with this skin-depigmenting disorder. He proposed that these cells survived best if un/dedifferentiated, opening up possibilities of treating even fully-white vitiligo skin of long duration.  Hair follicle in health & disease  Tobin with others has assessed the genetics of hair traits, and revealed several novel genes including the first gene associated with gray hair, in addition to other hair traits like mono-brow, beard density, and straight vs curly hair. He has also advanced the understanding of how oxidative stress can weaken the melanocyte system of both the skin and aging hair follicle, and how this may be stabilized via anti-oxidant protection. Tobin has conducted extensive research on Alopecia areata (AA). He was the first to show that patients with AA have circulating antibodies to hair follicle-specific antigens, including trichohyalin.

Talmudic references The Babylonian Talmud refers to three cities with populations greater than those who departed Egypt, thought to be hyperbolic speech: > Rabbi Assi said King Alexander Jannaeus (Yannai) had six-hundred thousand > townships on the King's Mountain and each one having the equivalent in > numbers of those departing Egypt, except three which had double the number > of those departing Egypt: Kefar Bish,According to Klein (1933), p. 293, > believed to be the nearby ruin of Khirbet al-Bis. Kefar Shiḥlayim, and Kefar > Dikraya. Kefar Bish (lit. \\"Evil Village\\") was so-called because they would > not give lodging to strangers. Kefar Shiḥlayim (lit. \\"Garden Cress Village\\") > was so-called because they made their living by cultivating garden cress. As > for Kefar Dikraya (lit. \\"Village of Males\\"), Rabbi Yochanan said that it was > so-called because the women of the village were prolific in giving birth to > male children first, and, afterwards, females.Babylonian Talmud (Gittin > 57a); Midrash Rabba (Lamentations Rabba 2:4) The account in the Jerusalem Talmud, likewise, mentions a population double that of the Israelites who left Egypt, a characteristically exaggerated number in the Talmud, but also differs slightly: > There were three villages, each one having a population twice the number of > the Israelites who departed Egypt: Kefar Bish, Kefar Shiḥlaya, and Kefar > Dikraya. Why is it that they call it Kefar Bish? It is because they would > not show hospitality to wayfarers. And why is it that they call it Kefar > Shiḥlaya?

And why is it that they call it Dikraya? > It is because all of their women would give birth to male children. Unless > one of them went out from there, they could not give birth to a > female.Jerusalem Talmud (Taanit 4:5 [24b]) Etymology The origin of the name of the settlement Kefar Shiḥlayim is explained in the Jerusalem Talmud as being because they were prolific in child-bearing, just as garden-cress (Aramaic: taḥlūsiya) grows profusely when cultivated. The Aramaic word is equivalent to the Mishnaic Hebrew word for the same, being shiḥlayim.Tosefta (Shabbat 15:13; Shevi'it 4:12), Jerusalem Talmud (Avodah Zarah 5:3), Babylonian Talmud (Avodah Zarah 29a). In the Babylonian Talmud the name of the settlement is attributed to the fact that the inhabitants of that place subsisted on the traffic of cress. The explanations given for these sites are thought to be merely a play on the Hebrew words , , and , and not historically authentic. When these traditions were narrated in the 3rd-century CE, these places were thought to already be in ruins. Linguists have pointed out that the Greek language cannot convey the guttural sound of the Hebrew letter ḥet () and, which in the case of the name שחלים, the medial with a vowel, when it represents a laryngeal rather than a velar, is variously rendered: by a single or double vowel or by omission of the sign, such as (Exod. 6:19) \\\\-- (); (Num. 21:19) \\\\-- (). The same rendering is had when transliterating the Hebrew Shihlayim into Greek, and which in English has been rendered as Sallis () in Josephus' The Jewish War (3.2.2.), and Saaleim () in Eusebius' Onomasticon (160:9–10). Israeli historical geography, Yoel Elitzur, noting the same phonetic factors, wrote that place names bearing the Hebrew glottal consonants /h/ is not known in surviving names from the Onomasticon. Hebrew names such as Pella = and Sallis (Saaleim) = are always transcribed by Greek writers in a geminative form, rather than in a guttural. Thomsen and Nestle conclude that the Sallis mentioned by Josephus is identical with the Saaleim of Eusebius. (Leipzig 1907) Similarly, Schlatter identifies Kefar Shiḥlayim of the Talmud with Sallis of Josephus. Neubauer, throwing further light on the subject, suggests that the identification of Kefar Shiḥlayim, found in the Talmud and midrashic literature, be recognized in the name Shilḥim of the Bible (). View from Tel Erani, outside of Kiryat Gat  Identification  Ruin Tel 'Erani (Tell esh-Sheikh el-ʽAreini) Several sites have been proposed for the ancient Kefar Shiḥlayim. Josephus places Sallis (Chaallis) in Idumaea, a geographical region of ancient Palestine directly south-southwest of Jerusalem.Josephus, The Jewish War 3.2.2. (3.13) Photo showing Tel Erani and village Iraq al-Manshiyya - 1940  Iraq al-Manshiyya  () Kefar Shiḥlayim has been tentatively identified with the Arab village of Iraq al-Manshiyya (\\"Cliffs of the place of growth\\"), north-east of Gaza, where is now built the Israeli town of Kiryat Gat. The chief proponents of this theory being historical geographers Peter Thomsen, Samuel Klein and Paul Romanoff. Samuel Klein went so far as to note that in extant Greek texts of Josephus' The Jewish War (3.2.2.) there are found two versions of the Greek transliterated name \\"Sallis,\\" the one being = Chaallis, and the other being = Sallis. Klein then conflates the two renditions of the same place-name to come up with = Kefar Shiḥlayim, and which Klein says was called by Eusebius and other Arab authors by the name Saḥalin. Yoel Elitzur followed in Klein's footsteps, proposing the same location for the village, based on the similar Arabic name preserved in the 1596 Ottoman tax registers. Other researchers have concluded that the strongest argument in favor of the priority of the Iraq al-Manshiyya site for Kefar Shihlayim is the preservation of the site's old name in the 1596 Ottoman tax registers, where the name is mentioned as (Menšīyet es-Saḥalīn). According to Press, the adjacent Tell known as Tel ʽErani (Tell esh-Sheikh el-ʽAreini)The Tel's modern designation is \\"Tel Aerni Tel Jet.\\" bore the old name of ʽIraq el-Menšiye during the Mamluk and Ottoman period, a name that was only later applied to the Arab village at the foot of the Tell.  Khirbet Shaḥleh  Yeshayahu Press, chief editor of Topographical-Historical Encyclopedia of the Land of Israel, proposed that the town Kefar Shiḥlayim lay within the confines of the ruin Khirbet Shaḥleh (Kh. Šaḥleh), now Ḥórvat Šēlaḥ, a ruin located almost 2 statute miles to the east of Iraq al-Manshiyya, and called Khŭrbet Shalkhah in the British Survey of Western Palestine map (III, 285). F.M. Abel and Israeli archaeologist, Avi- Yonah, mention this site under the name Šalḫa. Israeli archaeologist Yoram Tsafrir is a major proponent of this theory.  Sahlim  Klein, without knowledge of the 1596 Ottoman tax registry, proposed a secondary site for Kefar Shiḥlayim as being \\"Sahlim near Ascalon,\\" an indefinite site, but as a possible alternative to Iraq al-Manshiyya.Samuel Klein (ed.) (n.d.), Encyclopaedia Judaica, Eshkol: Jerusalem, p. 1138 Klein's view seems to be purely based on the assumption that \\"Sahlim near Ascalon\\" was a place other than Iraq al-Manshiyya.  Tell esh-Sheri'ah  German historical geography Georg Kampffmeyer proposed that Sharuhen found in (a site rarely discussed by scholars of topography) be recognised in the name Tell esh-Sheri'ah, a ruin situated ca. north-west of Beersheba. Albright, dissenting, thought that the same site was realized in Tell el-Huweilfeh, a ruin east of Dahiriyeh, or else in Tell el-Fârʿah, west of Beersheba. On the assumption that Shilḥim is a corruption of the name Sharuhen, as proposed by historical geographers, and that Shilḥim was the site of Kefar Shiḥlayim, this would point to a different locale. Kampffmeyer's view, however, is highly unlikely, as it is to assume that the old appellation was changed in the interim and returned back to a phonetic-sound nearest its earliest phonetic-sound.  History  In circa 64 CE, when Cestius and his contingent of Roman soldiers were defeated by the people of Jerusalem, this greatly emboldened the war-like faction of Jerusalem who resolved to subdue also the inhabitants of the coastal town of Ascalon, a town inhabited by foreigners and which had a Roman garrison stationed there. The attack made by the advancing soldiers was thwarted by the Roman army and the town's defenders, which, after many of the town's assailants had fallen, those of the Jewish nation who retreated fled with their commander Niger of Perea to a town called Sallis in Idumaea, thought to be Shiḥlayim. There, the few who escaped, recuperated and enlisted other able-bodied men of their fellow countrymen to launch a second attack against Ascalon, but once again failed in their endeavor.Josephus, pp. 575-583(3.1.1.–3.2.3.) In the early 2nd century, a man from the village appeared before R. Tarfon.Jerusalem Talmud (Jer. 16:5, 15d) A settlement is mentioned by Eusebius from the beginning of the fourth century CE called Saaleim (), which he places seven Roman miles (ca. 10 km.) west of Eleutheropolis (Beit Guvrin). Medieval geographer Yāqūt al-Ḥamawi (Muʿğam 3:46, 49) mentioned \\"in the territory of ʿAsqelân\\" a contemporary settlement called Siḥlīn (). A locality by this name is also mentioned in a Crusader letter dated 1136 CE. The last clue to the name preservation is the name of the settlement of Menshiyet es-Saḥalin, documented in the Ottoman Census of 1596, which probably refers to the former town Iraq al-Manshiyya in present-day Kiryat Gat.

Biography  His father, Émile François Toché (1802-1884), was a shipowner. He originally planned to become an architect and studied with Félix Thomas, who had participated in the first excavation of Nineveh. After completing his studies, he travelled through Spain and the Middle East, then went to Venice, where he studied and made sketches of the buildings. While there, he made the acquaintance of Édouard Manet, who inspired him to pursue painting. From 1875 to 1888, he worked on a large project: painting historical and allegorical frescoes in the Grand Galerie of the Château de Chenonceau. When they had been completed, he created designs for the Chateau's stained glass. During his work there, he met the writer, Gustave Flaubert, who asked him to illustrate the definitive edition of his novel, The Temptation of Saint Anthony. In 1880, he painted decorations in Le Chabanais; a famous brothel. This earned him the nickname, \\"Pubis de Chabanais\\" (a play on Puvis de Chavannes).\\"Splendeurs et misères, images de la prostitution\\", in ', series 5, 2015, p.26. His first public exhibition came in 1887, at the Galerie Georges Petit, where he displayed the drawings he had made for the frescoes at Chenonceau. At the Exposition Universelle of 1889, he helped decorate several of the pavilions; including the Liberal Arts, Republic of South Africa, Argentina, and Viticulture. He also designed one of the posters for the event. Later, he created frescoes at the Théâtre Graslin in Nantes and at the Olympia in Paris. In 1893, he produced a series of illustrations on the history of costume for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Some of his posters may be seen at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.

Recorded at Bee Creek Studios in Spicewood, Texas and the Austin Recording Studio in Austin, Texas, it was produced solely by the band's frontman Ray Benson and released in March 1987 as the group's first album back on Epic Records. 10 was the group's first album on a major label since 1980's Framed, and its first to register on the US Billboard charts since 1978's Wheelin' and Dealin'. Following the release of Pasture Prime in 1985, Asleep at the Wheel experienced a resurgence in popularity which led to them re- signing with Epic. The group settled with a new lineup of Benson, steel guitarist John Ely, bassist David Dawson, pianist Tim Alexander, drummer David Sanger, fiddler Larry Franklin and saxophonist Michael Francis, four of whom had featured on the 1985 record. 10 was the band's first album since the departure of Chris O'Connell, although she appears as a guest. 10 was a critical and commercial success. The album was Asleep at the Wheel's second release to reach the top 20 of the US Billboard Top Country Albums chart, peaking at number 16. The collection also spawned four singles, all of which registered on the Hot Country Singles chart, with \\"House of Blue Lights\\" peaking at number 17 – the band's second to reach the top 20 of the chart. Critical reviews of the album were mainly positive, praising its return to the band's Western swing sound. Background In 1986, Asleep at the Wheel introduced a new lineup comprising lead vocalist and guitarist Ray Benson, steel guitarist John Ely, bassist David Dawson, pianist Tim Alexander, drummer David Sanger, fiddler Larry Franklin and saxophonist Michael Francis. The band signed with Epic Records and recorded its ninth studio album that year, which was its first since Chris O'Connell's departure after becoming pregnant. In early 1987, Epic imprint CBS/Nashville Senior Vice President Rick Blackburn reported that the album was \\"just about done\\", claiming that \\"They're better now than they've ever been and their confidence level is soaring\\". \\"Way Down Texas Way\\" (written by Billy Joe Shaver) was issued as the lead single from 10 in January 1987, reaching number 39 on the US Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. The album was released in March. \\"House of Blue Lights\\" (first recorded by Freddie Slack) was released as the album's second single in May and became the band's second song to reach the top 20 of the Billboard country chart, peaking at number 17. Two more tracks were issued from 10 and registered on the Hot Country Singles chart – Ray Benson's \\"Boogie Back to Texas\\" peaked at number 53, and Guy Clark's \\"Blowin' Like a Bandit\\" peaked at number 59. Reception=Commercial 10 entered the Billboard Top Country Albums chart at number 45 in April 1987, later becoming the band's third album (and their first release in eleven years) to reach the top 20 when it peaked at number 16 in July. It also reached number 12 on the Cash Box Country Albums chart. Critical Media reviews of 10 were generally positive. Billboard magazine described the album as \\"a solid collection of mainly Western swing numbers\\", praising \\"House of Blue Lights\\", \\"I Want a New Drug\\" and \\"Blues Stay Away from Me\\" in particular. Cash Box also highlighted the Freddie Slack and Delmore Brothers tracks, as well as Fontaine Brown's \\"Big Foot Stomp\\". Canadian magazine RPM outlined that \\"[the band's] brand of Western swing music is almost legend\\", hailing the record as \\"a fun album\\" and describing it as \\"the real country mood music\\".

A series of lively sketches, the Review found them more entertaining than edifying.\\"Some Criminals\\", Saturday Review, Vol. 131, No. 3423 (4 June 1921), p. 461. His Society Sensations was reviewed in The Bookman in 1922 who opined that his works were easy to assemble from newspaper reports, memoirs, and similar sources, but acknowledged their entertainment value and that there was a significant market for such works.

Nonetheless, Edwards identified in O'Mahony an affinity for the London underworld found in districts such as Soho, and a willingness for his characters to mention contemporary criminal cases such as the rape and murder of 10 year old Vera Page in 1931 which is referenced in the book by O'Mahony's detective Wake. The book is also notable for leaving the murder, and the introduction of Wake who will solve it, until half way through the story.\\"Introduction\\" by Martin Edwards in Charles Kingston (2015) Murder in Piccadilly.

It was written by Michael J. Ostwald and Josephine Vaughan, both of whom are architecture academics at the University of Newcastle (Australia); it was published in 2016 by Birkhäuser, as the first volume in their Mathematics and the Built Environment book series. Topics The book applies the box counting method for computing fractal dimension, via the ArchImage software system, to compute a fractal dimension from architectural drawings (elevations and floor plans) of buildings, drawn at multiple levels of detail. The results of the book suggest that the results are consistent enough to allow for comparisons from one building to another, as long as the general features of the images (such as margins, line thickness, and resolution), parameters of the box counting algorithm, and statistical processing of the results are carefully controlled. The first five chapters of the book introduce fractals and the fractal dimension, and explain the methodology used by the authors for this analysis, also applying the same analysis to classical fractal structures including the Apollonian gasket, Fibonacci word, Koch snowflake, Minkowski sausage, pinwheel tiling, terdragon, and Sierpiński triangle. The remaining six chapters explain the authors' choice of buildings to analyze, apply their methodology to 625 drawings from 85 homes, built between 1901 and 2007, and perform a statistical analysis of the results. The authors use this technique to study three main hypotheses, with a fractal structure of subsidiary hypotheses depending on them. These are *That the decrease in the complexity of social family units over the period of study should have led to a corresponding decrease in the complexity of their homes, as measured by a reduction in the fractal dimension. *That distinctive genres and movements in architecture can be characterized by their fractal dimensions, and *That individual architects can also be characterized by the fractal dimensions of their designs. The first and third hypotheses are not convincingly supported by the analysis, but the results suggest further work in these directions. The second hypothesis, on distinctive fractal descriptions of genres and movements, does not appear to be true, leading the authors to weaker replacements for it. Audience and reception The book is aimed at architects and architecture students; its mathematical content is not deep, and it does not require much mathematical background of its readers. Reviewer Joel Haack suggests that it could also be used for general education courses in mathematics for liberal arts undergraduates.

B. Mayor on vegetarianism. Background Herkomer, 1891 Reverend Professor John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor, born in Baddegama, Ceylon, in 1825, was an English scholar and writer. Mayor became a strict vegetarian and teetotaller. He was also librarian and a professor at the University of Cambridge, and as noted in Cassell's Family Magazine, a \\"well-known classical scholar.\\" At thirteen years old, Moore had eschewed all animal products for a whole Lent. He later returned to a mixed diet of vegetables and meat. He did, however, experiment with rationing foods, and researched the problems with tea drinking. Approximately two decades later, he listed several reasons, which he would repeat to friends, upon his changing to a strictly vegetable diet. Some of these reasons were, that \\"ten of us can live where one flesh-eater pure and simple must starve,\\" because \\"homo sapiens are closest to fruit-eating apes rather than flesh-eating beasts of prey,\\" and that \\"fruit and seeds uproot the drink crave.\\" He also noted that he has derived inspiration for this diet from the \\"sages [of] earlier epochs,\\" such as Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Epicurus, Masinissa, Plutarch, Seneca, Musonius, Clement, Chrysostom, Bernard, Cyrus, Decius, Fabricicuis, and General Gordon. Mayor became a member of the Vegetarian Society in 1881, and as British academic Hugh Fraser Stewart writes, \\"to its great advantage and his own.\\" He became the President of the Vegetarian Society in 1883. Many of Mayor's vegetarian writings were published in the book, Plain Living and High Thinking in 1897. Mayor died in 1910, in Cambridge. Address Mayor delivered the address \\"What is Vegetarianism?\\" before the Vegetarian Society, at its annual meeting, in Manchester, on October 14th, 1885. At the time of the meeting, Mayor was a professor of Latin, and a Senior Fellow of St. John's College, in Cambridge. Publication Third edition, with notes An early edition of What is Vegetarianism? was printed at Manchester, by the Vegetarian Society, in 1886. The third edition, which was published in 1889, is 16 pages in total length, and printed in a demy octavo collation. \\"What is Vegetarianism?\\" appears within a collection of Mayor's writings, entitled Plain Living and High Thinking, which was published in 1897. In the same year, it was split into two editions of the monthly periodical The Vegetarian, the first half of the essay appearing in the July 15th edition, and the second half in the August 15th edition. A revised and englarged version of the third edition, which is 22 pages long and printed in a demy octavo collation, was published in 1898, by the Vegetarian Society, at 19 Oxford Street, in Manchester, London. It was 22 x 13 cm, and the cost was one penny. This version contains twenty notes, which includes a diagram, as well as fancy font. Editions of What is Vegetarianism? are held at public and university libraries in England and Scotland. Content Notes and Queries entry for Vegetarianism, which quotes Mayor's work Mayor opens \\"What is Vegetarianism?\\" by referencing British surgeon and polymath Sir Henry Thompson's assertions from 1879 editions of Nineteenth Century, on the vegetable diet, the land maintenance to support it, when compared to one which utilizes meat. He then proposes to investigate Addressing the use of the word vegetarian, Mayor writes that if \\"we called ourselves botanophagists, or phytophagists, or cerealians, that would not of necessity imply the exclusive, but only the customary use of vegetable diet or of grain. Two little words continually skulk into the definition of our name—only and all,\\" adding that when \\"librarian means an \\"eater of books,\\" antiquarian \\"an eater of antiques,\\" even then vegetarian will not, cannot, mean \\"an eater of vegetables.\\"\\" This is discussed by the English librarian and vegetarian activist William E. A. Axon, in the weekly academic periodical Notes and Queries, who wrote that \\"those interested will find in this address a further discussion of the subject by both English and German writers,\\" adding that \\"it may be well to add that the word \\"vegetarian\\" came into vogue with the establishment of the Vegetarian Society in 1847, and has not been traced further back than 1845.\\" Axon offers for any interested readers who wish to know more about vegetarianism to \\"send me a postcard,\\" at 257, Deansgate, Manchester, and \\"I shall be happy to send them some information on the matter.\\" In 1886 work Juvenal, which is a supplement to the poems of Latin author Juvenal, Mayor notes that he has \\"corrected Sir Henry's error, shared by Prof. Skeat and other lexicographers, as to the origin and meaning of the term Vegetarianism. It also occurs in Ed. v. Hartmann's attack on Vegetarianism ('was sollen wir essen?' in his 'Moderne Probleme' Leipz. 1886, p. 15). At the end of the work, is an advertisement by the Vegetarian Society for two other works by Mayor, Plain Living and High Thinking, for one shilling, and Mercy not Curiosity, the Mother of Medicine, for one penny. Reception In an article entitled \\"What is Vegetarianism\\" in the February 1, 1910 edition of the periodical Good Health, the author writes that there \\"appear[s] to be a number of misapprehensions concerning [the vegetarian diet].\\" They write \\"in a few words, it mean wholesome living,\\" quoting Mayor in that the word is a derivative of the Latin vegeo, which means to thrive and be strong. He closes with remarking that the word vegetable is a reference to plant foods because \\"the plant is conceived as giving life power.\\" References=CitationsSources    External links \\"What is Vegetarianism?\\" in The Vegetarian Category:1886 non- fiction books Category:English non-fiction books Category:Books about vegetarianism Category:Pamphlets Category:Vegetarian-related mass media ","title":"What is Vegetarianism?"},{"id":"64345302","text":"Kyla Anne Leibel (born October 9, 2001) is a Canadian swimmer.

The division was re-established on 17 February 1943 in Brittany from recovered soldiers and replacement troops and reached again full division strength on 9 June 1943. The division was then initially entrusted with coastal protection tasks in Italy and were in December 1943 moved to Croatia to participate in anti-partisan operations. From there it went to northern Ukraine, Poland and Upper Silesia, where it fought in several defensive battles.

Gentrified architecture is often compared with the style of architecture preexisting the process of gentrification in a particular location. As a result, its presence has been described by Maria Nicanor as producing “two very different dynamics and two very different futures.” The architectural style has been identified as a marker of borders between communities and a site of racialized hostilities.  Effects  Early 20th-century buildings next to a new loft tower in Mexico City's Colonia Roma Gentrified architecture has been described as transformative and obliterating because it does not modify or build from an existing architectural tradition of an area, but rather changes it completely. The presence of gentrified architecture produces both material and symbolic changes to an area, shaping collective perceptions and altering behaviors. An area once \\"strongly associated with the working class,\\" which may be perceived by outsiders as \\"unsafe\\" or \\"dangerous,\\" may shift with the presence of gentrified architecture. For outsiders, it brings a new heroic \\"innovative,\\" \\"forward-looking,\\" and \\"cool\\" identity to a location. The construction of buildings in a gentrified architectural style increases appeal for outsiders, who are often tourists, white, and wealthy future residents, who see an area as \\"revitalized\\" or \\"redeveloped\\" because of its presence. This creates space for more developmental projects in a gentrified architectural style, as the buildings increasingly serve as invitations to outsiders while communicating to the current residents that the space is not for them or their communities. Gentrified architecture may drain the presence of color from certain areas. For example, in Santa Ana, California, the \\"colorful pastel tones of the commercial buildings that used to represent a symbol of Mexican architectural design\\" were replaced with \\"neutral tones.\\"  Reception  Gentrified style has received mixed reception. Gentrified architecture has been described by academics as embodying a \\"haunting predictability\\" that is \\"replicated from city to city.\\" Michael Sorkin refers to it as \\"urban renewal with a sinister twist, an architecture of deception which, in its happy-face familiarity, constantly distances itself from the most fundamental realities.\\" Houston architect Ben Koush describes gentrified style buildings as follows: \\"I think they’re ugly, but I also realize that they’re following the requirements of the market. What is upsetting is that people made lives for themselves, and then the middle-class white people want to move back in and claim the territory for themselves and push those people out.\\" Maria Nicanor refers to the buildings as creating \\"a rampant sense of single-family homogeneity entirely devoid of any imagination and disconnected from the realities of families and how they age.\\"  Gallery  File:Condos in Bedford Stuyvesant.jpg File:Gentrification architecture Brooklyn Condos.jpg File:Gentrification architecture in Bedford Stuyvesant.jpg  References  Category:Architectural styles Category:Gentrification ","title":"Gentrified architecture"},{"id":"64345420","text":"Md.

He introduced to America new methods of manufacturing cannons during the Revolutionary War, and later of processing cotton. Early life and career Orr was the son of Robert Orr of Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, and he was brought up in the trade of a gunsmith and locksmith. He emigrated to America, arriving in Boston, Massachusetts in 1737; he and two other emigrants from Lochwinnoch set up a blacksmith's shop in Easton, Massachusetts.\\"Men of Iron\\" Journal of the Renfrewshire Local History Forum, Volume 6 (1994). In June 1740 he settled at Bridgewater in Massachusetts, which was already notable for iron-manufacturing. Here he manufactured scythes and edge-tools, setting up the first trip hammer to be constructed in Massachusetts. Through him the manufacture of edge-tools spread through Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.Gorden Berg, Bruce Adams. Laboring for Independence: Workers in the Revolution. Department of Labor, 1976. Page 6. In 1748 he made five hundred muskets for the province of Massachusetts Bay, believed to have been the first weapons of the kind produced in the country. During the American Revolutionary War, Orr and a French business partner built a foundry to cast iron and brass cannon and cannon-balls. They made cannons using a new method introduced from Europe: instead of casting the cannon with a cylindrical cavity which was later refined, the gun was cast solid and the gun barrel was then drilled. This produced a more reliable and accurate cannon. After the war After the war he was a senator for Plymouth County in the Massachusetts legislature for several years. Interested in the new cotton processing machinery in use in Britain, he set up in 1786 with Scottish brothers Robert and Alexander Barr carding, roving and spinning machinery; these are thought to be the first such machines in America. Made with the help of a grant from the Massachusetts legislature and known as the \\"state models\\", Orr encouraged copies to be made. He also established a business marketing flax seed, and invented a machine for cleaning flax seed. Orr died in Bridgewater on 6 December 1798. Family In 1742 he married Mary Bass; they had ten children. Their son Robert Orr was a colonel in the Anglo-American War and was armorer of the United States arsenal at Springfield, Massachusetts.

It is the television station of the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires. History The Federal Broadcasting Committee (COMFER) authorized the award of a television station, originally on channel 66, in 2000 to the Franciscan order; the concession was modified to specify channel 21 in 2001. Previously, other archdioceses had received radio and television concessions after COMFER was empowered to award them to the church in 1990. Construction and operation of the station, however, was left to the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires pursuant to a 2004 agreement; the archdiocese had maintained a television production center since 1986. The archdiocese launched the station on a test basis in January 2006 from a transmitter located at the Inmaculada Concepción Seminary in Villa Devoto and studios located on the 10th floor of an archdiocesan building at Rivadavia 413. Full service began in July 2007. In 2013, the Vatican Television Center reached a deal with Canal 21 to allow it access to the large archive of material it had pertaining to Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, who was elected as Pope Francis earlier that year. It adopted its present name of Orbe 21 on December 12, 2014 and was added to the Movistar+ service in multiple Spanish-speaking countries, including Spain. The addition to the Movistar+ service came after the pope had a conversation with Telefónica president César Alierta. Commercial network Telefe has provided significant support for Canal Orbe 21's operations. When Canal 21 moved into the former Argentina Sono Film studios, Telefe began paying its rent; additionally, Canal Orbe 21 was initially slated to share space with Telefe on its digital television multiplex. Ultimately, Canal Orbe TV was assigned 21.2, transmitting in 720p resolution at 6.5 Mbit/s on the channel 21 multiplex shared with channel . Programming When then-Cardinal Bergoglio gave instructions to Julio Rimoldi, the first director general of Canal 21, he said the station should be positioned \\"between nude women and the Sunday Mass, in the middle\\", and Aleteia has described it as lacking \\"the odor of the sacristy\\". The channel airs a diversified schedule of programming, including public affairs, entertainment, and children's shows. It also airs Catholic masses, events of the pope, and extensive coverage of apostolic visits and important liturgical conferences. Two thirds of its output is produced in- house. One of Bergoglio's programs prior to becoming pope—Biblia, diálogo vigente (Bible, Living Dialogue), which he co-hosted with a rabbi and a Protestant priest—was presented with an honorary Martín Fierro Award in 2013. Local repeaters In 2015, the Federal Authority for Audiovisual Communication Services awarded the Catholic Church twelve new TV stations, which will rebroadcast Orbe 21 programming with local insertions for those dioceses that can financially sustain it.

He was convicted of these deaths and received three terms of life imprisonment, and remains the sole suspect in two similar murders that occurred in nearby Gresham, in 1987. Early life Little is known about Reed's early life. By the age of 14, he was a registered sex offender and was put in a residential program for his crimes, but, as he wasn't considered dangerous, he was released. In the following years, Reed met Gail Bennett, whom would he would later marry, but the latter would subsequently divorce Todd in 1997. Reed worked at Rinella Produce, where he was described as a dilligent worker who never made any trouble. During this time, several homeless women from around the city began to mysteriously disappear. Murders=Confirmed * Lilla Faye Moler (28) - a homeless prostitute suffering from manic depression, Moler had previous convictions for drug use and prostitution. She went missing in April 1999, and her body was later found by a couple walking their dog on May 7, covered with tree branches and leaves. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled to death. A condom containing the killer's DNA was found 28 feet away from her body. * Stephanie Lynn Russell (26) - a fellow homeless prostitute and acquaintance of Moler, Russell's body was found by police while they were searching the area where the previous victim was located. Her body was discarded only a quarter-mile away from Lilla, and had also been sexually assaulted and strangled. Unlike Moler, authorities suspected that Russell had died much more recently, likely within a week of being found. * Alexandria Nicole Ison (17) - a transient runaway with convictions for drug use (specifically heroin and cocaine), Ison's body was found by a hiker on a trail running along Forest Park on June 2, which hadn't been searched by authorities the previous month. Her body had been dumped down a steep hill, about a quarter-mile away from the other victims, and she had also been sexually assaulted and strangled like them. Ison had been missing since May. Suspected * Jennifer Lynn Tchir (15) - Tchir went missing on July 3, 1987 in Gresham, and was last seen with Reed's girlfriend, Gail Bennett. Initially, a biology student from Mt. Hood Community College discovered a human shin and heel bone on July 18, 1988, and over the week, Explorer Scouts discovered enough bones from the brushy fields in the southeastern part of the city to make a nearly complete skeleton. It was later positively identified as Tchir by the Multnomah County Medical Examiner's office, with the cause of death being labeled as asphyxiation. * Mindi Coleen Thomas (12) - Thomas disappeared from her apartment complex in Gresham on August 3, 1987. Like Tchir, she was last seen in the company of Gail Bennett. That same October, her remains were found near a hiking trail close to the Mt. Hood Community College. She too had been strangled to death. According to the Gresham Police Department, the suspect in both of these cases was described as a white male in his late teens to early 20s, with very dark, short hair, thick eyebrows and little beard hairs along the chin line. He wore military-type glasses with metal frames and a stud-type earring in his left ear, and apparently drove a car described as a metallic blue-colored 1970s model Dodge Charger. Capt. Gerald Johnson noted in a written statement that the man was likely acquainted with the girls or their circle of friends, as he was seen calling out to Tchir by name at a convenience store on the day of her disappearance. Arrest, trial and imprisonment On July 7, a female police officer who matched the then-unknown killer's physical preferences posed as a prostitute in an attempt to lure him out. Reed was observed stalking the officer, and one of the lookouts recognized him from an earlier conviction for burglary and assault, from which he spent 2.5 years behind bars. On July 18, Reed was arrested at his job in Rinella Produce for the murders of Moler, Russell and Ison, after his DNA was matched to the crime scenes. On February 23, 2001, he plead guilty to the murders in order to avoid the death penalty, and was sentenced to three consecutive life terms. Reed was questioned about the two 1987 Gresham murders, as he met every criteria for the suspect's description, but to this day, he has yet to be charged with either of them. As of June 2020, it is unclear in which prison Todd Alan Reed is housed in, or even if he's still alive.

In 1979, Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation passed the agreement for approval to the Ministry of Industry. After approval from the Planning Commission the construction of the factory began in 1980. The factory started commercial production in 1985. In the 1980s, the company had one of the biggest shares of the double edged safety blade market in Bangladesh. Its market share declined after 2000 when private companies entered the market. Since then production and revenue have declined for the company as well. In the 2013-2014 financial year it produced 76 million blades but that number declined to 47 million by 2019. The Centre for Policy Dialogue recommended that the government close down the factory due to the large number of private producers.

It was published by Varese, the main printing house for the Jesuit order in Rome in the mid-17th century. It was dedicated to Franz III. Nádasdy, a convert to Catholicism to whom Kircher had previously co-dedicated Oedipus Aegyptiacus. Arithmologia is the only one of Kircher's works devoted entirely to different aspects of number symbolism. Content Arithmologia was concerned with exploring numbers as the underlying principle and structure of the universe, and as the key to mystic understanding previously revealed to patriarchs and philosophers in ancient times. The field of arithmology may be understood as the intersection of traditional religious numerology and contemporary mathematics, drawing on ideas from Pythagoras, Gnosticism, and the Kabbala. The work discussed the significance of numbers in astrology, divination, magic formulas, amulets, seals and symbolic matrices. Kircher's purpose, as he declared in the final chapter, was to articulate a Christian philosophy of number, revealing the hidden harmonies within the material world and its connections with the spiritual. Illustrations The frontispiece depicts, at the top, the all-seeing Eye of Providence within a triangle representing the Holy Trinity. In each angle Hebrew letters spell out Jah, the name of God. Around this the nine orders of angels are arranged in three more overlapping triangles. Beneath this fly two putti, one carrying a ruler and a plumb line, while the other carries a tablet with the magic square of three. Within this square, numbers can be added by row, by column or diagonally, but always add up to fifteen. In the centre of the image is a winged representation of the cosmos; the winged sphere was an ancient Egyptian symbol that Kircher interpreted as meaning the anima mundi. On the outer rim of this sphere are the primum mobile and the fixed stars, and within them the planets orbiting around the static earth at the centre. Beneath this, in the realm of the physical world, sit a learned Jew with an open book displaying the stars of David and Solomon, and a classical philosopher pointing to a model of Pythagoras' theorem.

In 1924 he enrolled in law school in Rome, and he began to collaborate with various Roman periodicals. In 1926 he interrupted his university studies to do military service, initially at the Scuola Allievi Ufficiali of Rome (anti-aircraft artillery department) and later at Forte Belvedere in Florence, where he rose to the rank of Second Lieutenant. In 1928 he graduated in Rome with a degree in Law, and the following year he earned a second degree in Political Science from the University of Florence. He immediately began working as a clerk with a Roman law firm, but it was a short-lived experience. Uguccione soon abandoned the idea of becoming a lawyer in order to follow his passion for literature and the humanities. The decision to abandon his legal career was not welcomed by his father, marquis Ruggero Bourbon di Sorbello, who cut off his support with the clear intention of making his son come to his senses, forcing him to return to Perugia, the city where the family lived. It was in this climate of generational tension that the conditions would ripen for a decision that would mark a fundamental turning point in Uguccione’s life: leaving Italy to move to the United States.  The first period in the United States (1930-1936)  Uguccione Ranieri (far right) with the teachers of the Italian Summer School at Middlebury College, 1935 After a first exploratory trip to the United States in 1929 to gather information and check on work opportunities at North American universities, in the 1930-31 academic year Uguccione obtained a position as an instructor of Italian language and literature in the Italian Department of Yale University. Having entered the cultural life of the town of New Haven, Connecticut, he was active in the Yale Italian Society and with the city’s Circolo Italiano, where he was invited to hold several conferences on Italian art and literature. Starting in 1932, the Circolo Italiano of Boston invited him to lecture regularly on Italian literature. Interested in theater as a means for promoting the learning of the italian language, he wrote and staged, in collaboration with the University of Yale theater company, the one- act comedy Con le signore c'è più gusto (It’s More Fun with Ladies), performed in italian by Yale students on May 3, 1934. Two years later the play was published by Italian Publishers in New York.In this publication, probably on Uguccione’s instructions, the unusual typographic choice was made insert the main stress accent marks not only on truncated words, but also on proparoxytone words. As we read in the author’s introductory note, this made “the Italian language perfectly pronounceable at first sight.” See Uguccione Ranieri, Con le signore c'è più gusto, New York, Italian Publishers, 1936. From 1934 to 1936 Uguccione also taught at the Italian Summer School at Middlebury College, where he developed a course called “Modern Italy in Word and Thought.”He would be remembered for his efforts as a “man of many talents.” See Stephen A. Freeman, The Middlebury College. Foreign Language School 1915-1970. The Story of a Unique Idea, Middlebury, Vermont, Middlebury College Press, 1975, pp. 124-125. He made the acquaintance of Giuseppe Prezzolini, then professor of Italian Literature at Columbia University and director of the Casa Italiana from 1930 to 1940, who invited him to join the editorial staff of Casa Italiana’s Giornalino, a magazine for students and teachers of Italian in the United States. His interest in journalism was also expressed in his editorial contributions to two magazines, both publications of the Italy-America Society: Italy America Monthly and Italy America Review, of which he was managing editor in 1936.  The MinCulPop years and the anti- Fascist conspiracy  Returning to Italy in 1937, Uguccione began working with a temporary contract at the newly created Ministry of Popular Culture (MinCulPop); he was then hired the following year, with the title of First Secretary. He worked specifically with radio broadcasts in English, relations with the foreign press, and censorship. Although he was becoming increasingly intolerant of Mussolini’s regime, he was forced to keep his job out of economic necessity, eventually leaving his duties with the radio office and transferring to the foreign press general management, where he handled the administrative and personal affairs of foreign journalists, especially american journalists who remained in Italy until Mussolini’s declaration of war against the United States on December 11, 1941. He was called back to military service in November 1942 and sent to the base in Caserta, returning to Rome shortly afterward through the direct involvement of Princess Marie- José of Savoy, who most likely acted at the request of Uguccione’s mother, Romeyne Robert, who was acquainted with the princess. Uguccione later took part in the anti-Fascist conspiracy that revolved around the figure of Marie- José. Uguccione later recalled in some of his autobiographical writings the key role played by Marie-José: (From writings by Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello.Antonella Valoroso and Ruggero Ranieri, Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello. Un intellettuale tra due mondi, Perugia, Morlacchi Editore, 2019, pp. 53-54.) Edgardo Sogno also recalled how, in the spring of 1943, he, Uguccione and a group of liberal monarchists wrote an appeal to the king, asking him to depose Mussolini.Edgardo Sogno and Aldo Cazzullo, Testamento di un anticomunista. Dalla Resistenza al \\"golpe bianco\\", Milan, Mondadori, 2000, pp. 33-34. Despite this, according to Sogno, Uguccione had long since lost faith in the monarchy, and subsequent events only confirmed his republican convictions. These would emerge strongly in the period immediately following the war, when Uguccione publicly sided with the Republic on the occasion of the institutional referendum held on Sunday and Monday, June 2-3, 1946 to choose whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic after World War II.  Involvement with the Allies (1943-45)  British Army, 1943 Following the announcement of the armistice on September 8, 1943, Uguccione deserted, heading south and taking refuge at the villa of his friends Zeno and Andreola Vinci in Cupra Marittima. On the night of October 5 he carried out his first mission, rescuing a group of Jewish fugitives in Allied territory, using a makeshift boat to reach the Tremiti Islands.Elena Dundovich and Ruggero Ranieri, Scritti scelti di Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello 1906-1969, Firenze, Leo S. Olschki, 2004, pp. 69-72. With the consent of the Italian General Staff, Uguccione joined the Allied IS 9, an extension of the British MI9, or Military Intelligence Section 9, and its American counterpart. The MI9 was created in December 1940 with the task of supporting European resistance fighters in the territories occupied by the Nazi/Fascists to recover Allied soldiers in enemy territory, as well as to communicate with prisoners in POW camps, providing them with every possible assistance. The IS9, often called the A-Force in the Mediterranean zone, had the specific mission of helping Allied prisoners to escape, which was also done through the training of special agents to be sent into enemy territory. The IS9 network developed its activities in various parts of the Italian peninsula, especially along the Eastern Alps, where it was mainly a question of rescuing the crews of Allied bombers shot down by enemy antiaircraft, and in the areas between the Marche and Abruzzi regions, where there was a high concentration of escaped prisoners.There were three large camps for Allied prisoners in the Marches: at Sforzacosta, near Macerata; at Monte Urano, near Fermo; and at Servigliano, in the valley of the Tenna river. Uguccione remained in the Marche region from the winter of 1943 to the spring of 1944 to organize an escape route (“Ratline”), which helped hundreds of Allied prisoners (about 900 British/American soldiers, Yugoslav soldiers, Italian refugees, Jews, etc.) to escape. After the liberation of the Marches, he moved to the Arezzo front, and in July 1944 he participated in the battle of Florence. Later, after hurried training in Brindisi to prepare for a mission in the Alps, on the night between April 4th and 5th he parachuted into the Monte Pizzoc area in the Eastern Alps, together with an English lieutenant and an Italian radio operator (Operation Spider). There, together with the partisans of the Garibaldi “Nino Nannetti” Division, he managed to unite and bring to safety a large group of missing American airmen and to capture more than a thousand German soldiers. In the late stages of the war, he was sent to Austria to organize the first aid to the prison camps abandoned by the Germans in the area between Klagenfurt and Graz, where it was estimated that almost 40,000 Allied soldiers were held. His deeds during the war of liberation earned him commendations and decorations: on his return to Italy, in April 1945, he was decorated with the Silver Medal of Military Valor. In 1949 he was also awarded a bronze medal.  The post-war years = 1946-1952: Political involvement  Uguccione Ranieri with Alcide De Gasperi and Donato Martucci at the Viminale, 1948 After the war, Uguccione returned to Rome, initially establishing contacts with the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and obtaining several positions in liaison with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before being appointed to the newly-created Ministry of Tourism and Entertainment in 1960. In 1946 Uguccione provided his services as a press officer for the Italian delegation at the Paris Conference, where he translated Alcide De Gasperi’s speech into English for foreign journalists, for which he earned their praise.Indro Montanelli and Mario Cervi, L'Italia della Repubblica: 2 giugno 1946 – 18 aprile 1948, in Bur, Milan, Corriere della Sera, 2018, p. 87. Uguccione was an active participant in the cultural life of the newly liberated Rome. His small apartment in the capital, at Via dei Due Macelli no. 31, became a sort of intellectual and social hub, frequented by various personalities who constituted, or would constitute, the political, literary and journalistic elite of the post-war period: Giuseppe Antonio Borgese, Ugo Stille, Luigi Barzini, Alberto Moravia, Giannalisa Feltrinelli, Marina and Anna Maria Volpi, the writer Dino Terra, along with various well-known musicians, actors and politicians. Longtime friends included count Edgardo “Eddy” Sogno, Maurizio Lodi-Fè and Indro Montanelli. His close association with his friend, the writer and journalist Donato Martucci, which began in the 1930sIn an impulse of polemic irony, which arose following the Fascist directives that imposed the colloquial use of voi instead of Lei as the formal form of address, in the 1930s he wrote, together with his friend Donato Martucci, the ironic-satirical comedy Diamoci tutti del tu. The work was never performed and remained unpublished, as would two other experiments of the 1940s: the novellas Tanto la parola and Fiamma e burrasca., bore fruit in the form of two of his most original creations in 1948 and 1950: the political fantasy novels Non votò la famiglia De Paolis and Lo strano settembre 1950, both published by Longanesi, which were greatly successful both in Italy and abroad.Lo strano settembre 1950 was translated into English in 1962 under the title The Strange September of 1950, published by Horizon Press of New York. Also in the political fantasy genre was his unpublished theatrical work from the 1950s, Lo strano caso di President Diamond. In the years from the immediate post-war period up to 1952, Uguccione also showed a strong political commitment: he wrote articles for the magazine The Italian Post, edited by Pierluigi Tumiati, and at the time of the Monarchy/Republic referendum, he immediately sided with the republic, recalling the actions of the king at the time of the September 8th armistice and speaking strongly in support of the anti-Fascist and partisan resistance struggle. In this period Uguccione took a strongly liberal and democratic stance, hoping for social and economic renewal for Italy. He later established ties with the World Movement for World Federation Government, of which Giuseppe Antonio Borgese and his wife Elisabeth Mann were supporters and organizers. He became a member of the Executive Committee of the Italian section, working with the group’s two magazines, Notizie federaliste mondiali and Federalismo nel mondo, participating in conferences and events. He soon forsook his active militancy in the movement, the influence of which would also decline rapidly in the following years.  Return to the United States (1953) – The Italian Scene  In 1953 Uguccione began his second long period in the United States, following his appointment as the cultural attaché at the Italian Embassy in Washington with the task of managing the cultural office at the Consulate General of Italy in New York. The purpose of this office, located at 690 Park Avenue, was to provide information on Italy to anyone who requested it, and above all to promote positive relations between the United States and the Italian Republic, presenting Italy in its new identity as modern democratic country. It was within this context that the informational bulletin The Italian Scene was established. This was a 15-page monthly publication written in English, the decidedly ambitious purpose of which was to make the complexity of Italian political and cultural life comprehensible to the English-speaking world, including professionals working in the field of communication among its privileged audience. In the pages of The Italian Scene Uguccione told about the Italy of the 1950s-60s, providing its readers with latest important news, but also speaking about unusual events, ranging from politics to archeology, literature, cinema , science, music, theater, radio, television, architecture and editorial news. The success of this original publication among the readership of insiders earned him the praise of numerous Italian and foreign communication professionals, including the journalist and writer George Weller (1907‑2002), winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1943 and director of the Chicago Daily News office in Rome in the 1950s. In addition to his editorial duties for The Italian Scene, Uguccione had many other official tasks, including debates, conferences, interviews and trips to various parts of the United States. Starting in 1954 Uguccione oversaw the restoration of the home of Antonio Meucci and Giuseppe Garibaldi on Staten Island, which was later opened as the Garibaldi-Meucci Museum, to honor the memory of the two great Italians who had once lived there.Ruggero Ranieri, The life and work of a cosmopolitan intellectual: Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello (1906-1969), p. 9.  Returning to Italy – Journalism and the \\"hotline\\" with the States  Uguccione Ranieri with the consul general Edgardo Sogno in Philadelphia, 1961 In the summer of 1957 Uguccione returned to Italy, where he continued to work for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He temporarily suspended publication of The Italian Scene, which resumed in July 1958 and continued uninterrupted until his death.The latest issue, one of the few in which Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello's signature appears, came out in June 1969 a few months after the disappearance of its creator. At the same time, again in 1958, he began writing as an editorialist for important national and local newspapers, such as Il Corriere della Sera, La Nazione and the Giornale di Brescia, sometimes using the press to engage in campaigns such as his successful efforts in the United States for naming after Giovanni da Verrazzano the new bridge being built in New York between Brooklyn and Staten Island; it was christened as the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge on November 21, 1964. His journalistic battles in Italy were less fortunate, both in the campaign to have the A1 motorway (Autostrada del Sole) pass through UmbriaUguccione Ranieri, Due tracciati in guerra per l'autostrada del sole, in \\"La Nazione\\", 22 ottobre 1958.Uguccione Ranieri, Il raccordo tra Perugia e l'autostrada del Sole, in \\"La Nazione\\", 30 dicembre 1961.Ruggero Ranieri, Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello: scritti sulla tutela dei centri storici e del paesaggio (1957-1968). and in the more local battle undertaken to prevent the skyline of Perugia from being marred by a group of new RAI antennas with the construction of the structure known as the “Palazzo degli Orecchioni” (“Big Ears Building”) on the hill of Monteripido.Uguccione Ranieri, \\"Orecchioni\\" su Perugia. Si attendono ancora i progetti per il palazzo di Monteripido, in \\"La Nazione\\", 20 dicembre 1959., Starting in 1961, Uguccione would be sent to North America periodically by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hold conferences on the occasion of the first centennial of the Unification of Italy. A first series of presentations on themes from the Italian Risorgimento to the development of Italy in a century of united history took place from April to May 1961, touching eastern Canada, the Midwest, Texas and the Atlantic coast states. The second series was held in the autumn of 1961 in California, some Atlantic states, and New York City. Four years later, as part of the festivities planned for the 700th anniversary of Dante’s birth, Uguccione set off on a new tour in the United States, speaking at several universities (St. Mary’s College, Stanford University, University of California, University of San Francisco). He once again distinguished himself for his encyclopedic preparation, his fine sense of humor and his proud passion for Italian culture. His great success and the fame that accompanied him earned him the honorary citizenship of the city of San Francisco, receiving the keys to the city on October 30, 1965 from Mayor John Francis Shelley. In 1968, during one of his last U.S. public engagements, he collaborated in the organization of the Italian pavilion for the HemisFair Universal Exposition in San Antonio, Texas.  Final years and historical- literary writings  Starting in the 1960s, motivated mainly by the reorganization of the rich family archival heritage, Uguccione developed a renewed interest in local history, dedicating himself both to the events of the Ranieri Bourbon di Sorbello family and to his beloved Perugia. This interest resulted in two very successful historical-literary works: the best seller La bella in mano al boia (1st ed. Rizzoli, 1965),For Indro Montanelli, who dedicated a review to the volume which appeared in the Corriere della Sera on 30 March 1965, Uguccione's historical novel was noteworthy \\"because it is written in a masterly way, with a fluid style and with a humor of Manzonian flavor\\", but also because it could have been a model for those who had had the desire and the ability to bring to light characters and stories from the Italian archives \\"which are perhaps the most precious mine in Europe\\"Antonella Valoroso and Ruggero Ranieri, Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello. Un intellettuale tra due mondi, p. 150. a historical novel inspired by the chronicle of the story that shocked the town of Perugia in the year 1600 and led to the execution of the aristocrat Porzia Corradi, sentenced for adultery and put to death together with her lover, Roberto Valeriani, and a band of Perugian friends; and the powerful historical essay Perugia della Bell'Epoca, a work published posthumously in December 1969 that reconstructs the historical period starting from the city riots of June 20, 1859 (the Perugia Uprising), which occurred during the second War of Independence, up to May 24, 1915, the date of Italy’s entry into World War I. Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello died of a heart attack on May 28, 1969 in Rome, at the age of sixty-three.  Personality  Uguccione Ranieri, his wife Marilena and son Ruggero receive a group of international students at Palazzo Sorbello, ca. 1954 Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello was an intellectual immersed in his time, a humanist proud of a cultural heritage of which he felt himself to be the heir and interpreter. His multifaceted, eclectic personality is testified by his commitment to life and the numerous testimonies left by people connected with him. The jurist Ugo Castelnuovo-Tedesco (1890-1974) left a portrait of him in verse: «In speaking of things and people / Zeno first named Uguccione. / But meeting him one day, I was perplexed / at hearing him shout like a madman. / Our acquaintance, therefore / did not begin brilliantly, as I remember. / However, making fraternal amends / here it is right to render him justice. / Wanting to formulate my concepts / I say Uguccione is without flaws: / they are all excesses, excesses of passions, / the warm, lively ingenuousness of the good. / Educated in the Montessori system / he has always been honest within and without / and in life has never taken a step / if not freely and in good faith.» The most efficacious profile, however, remains that left by Indro Montanelli, a long-time friend of Uguccione who knew well his strengths and weaknesses. In a lengthy article published in Il Corriere della Sera on May 28, 1970, almost a year after his friend’s death, Montanelli remembers him as «the most naive, scatterbrained, mud-splattered man in the world, but also one of the most generous, unpredictable, warm, candid, fascinating and poetic. His conscience was the exact opposite of his ties and jackets: spotless.»Indro Montanelli, Uguccione, in \\"Il Corriere della Sera\\", 28 maggio 1970. For a complete transcription (ITA) see Antonella Valoroso and Ruggero Ranieri, Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello. Un intellettuale tra due mondi, pp. 153-155  Personal life  On October 21, 1951 Uguccione was wedded to Maria Maddalena de Vecchi (known as Marilena),In a letter sent to Edgardo Sogno on August 25, 1951, Uguccione announces his future marriage with these words: «There are big news for me: I marry Marilena. She will be my graceful silence as Coriolano said. We will marry very quietly in October by announcing later, so there will be no boredom to force friends to gift (understand?). But we want dear friends to wish us well and therefore I am telling you how I said it to Anna ». See Antonella Valoroso and Ruggero Ranieri, Uguccione Ranieri di Sorbello. Un intellettuale tra due mondi, p. 89. a refined, cultured woman from a prestigious Tuscan family. Her mother, Vittoria de’ Pazzi, was a descendant of the noble Pazzi family of Florence, and her father, count Bindo de Vecchi, was an esteemed anatomopathologist and the Rector of the University of Florence. The couple’s only child, Ruggero Ranieri di Sorbello, was born on August 21, 1952. In 1995, in honor of the memory of Uguccione Ranieri, his wife Marilena de Vecchi Ranieri and son Ruggero established the Fondazione Ranieri di Sorbello.

In 1920 he made his first professional appearance, as Jaising in Rabindranath Tagore's play Sacrifice.Gaye, p. 379 According to The Times it was in \\"the showy part of an effeminate soclalite\\" in Basil Dean's production of Frederick Lonsdale's Spring Cleaning (1925) that Blakelock made his name.\\"Mr Denys Blakelock\\", The Times, 14 December 1970, p. 11 In the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s Blakelock appeared in a succession of West End plays, many of them successful but undemanding.Gaye, p. 380 Feeling the need of a greater challenge he turned to the classics, appearing at the Arts Theatre from 1942 to 1945, playing, among other roles, Aguecheek in Twelfth Night, Androcles in Androcles and the Lion, Bob Acres in The Rivals, and the title role in The Magistrate. Despite his continuing success as an actor Blakelock grew disenchanted with the theatre, and in 1954 he abandoned the part of Firs, the old major domo, during rehearsals of John Gielgud's production of The Cherry Orchard. After that he worked extensively on television and radio, taught at RADA, and wrote a biography of Eleanor Farjeon, essays, and an autobiography. His acting work for the BBC in his last years included a long- running role in the series Waggoners' Walk. Blakelock died in London on 9 December 1970, aged 69. In its obituary The Times commented, \\"It seems sad that a man whose acting, especially in comedy, gave so much pleasure should himself have found so little satisfaction in it. At least, however, he enjoyed passing on his knowledge and his experience of the problems of the stage to student classes at RADA. and to pupils who worked with him privately\\".

Clarence was regarded as the pioneer of Medical industry in South Africa especially for his crucial contributions in eliminating the HIV/AIDS from the country. He also actively advocated against apartheid during his career and also voiced against corruption which mounted during the Presidency of Jacob Zuma. He served as former chairman of the Board of Healthcare Funders as well as long serving board member of it. He died on 12 May 2020 due to COVID-19 complications at the age of 68 while serving as the chairperson of the Council of Medical Schemes. His term as chairperson of CMS was supposed to end by September 2020.  Career  Clarence joined the fight against apartheid at the age of 25 and spent most of his life as a youngster fighting for the rights of black Africans. In 1976, he secretly left South Africa to safeguard himself from apartheid and pursued his higher studies in the field of medicine in Bulgaria. He graduated from the Sofia Medical Academy in 1986 and became a qualified professional doctor after training while in exile. Clarence's achievement was lauded among the Black Africans community, as it was treated as a rare milestone among black community at a time when apartheid was in effect. He also joined the armed wing of the African National Congress, uMkhonto we Sizwe and received his military training in Angola. He also lived and worked in Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Australia while in exile prior to his return to South Africa. He returned to South Africa in 1990's after the fallout of apartheid which also saw the release of freedom fighters including Nelson Mandela. He obtained a diploma in community medicine from the Stellenbosch University in 1993 and a diploma in Palliative Care at the University of Cape Town in 2002. His return to South Africa was crucial when the country confronted with AIDS epidemic which was at its peak and he pioneered the fight to combat the spread of the AIDS virus. He also co-chaired the first national meeting of organisations at Nasrec in 1992 highlighting the importance of tackling HIV. Clarence also faced backlash for his statements about HIV/AIDS by many members of the African National Congress, as most facts regarding the virus was denied by the African National Congress. Clarence along with his wife Nancy opened an HIV clinic in Germiston and started treating patients with AIDS for free when Thabo Mbeki served as the President of the country from 1999 to 2008, who consistently denied the spread of AIDS and refused to distribute life saving antiretroviral medicine to treat patients living with AIDS. He was appointed as chairperson of Council of Medical Schemes in 2010 by the then minister of health, Aaron Motsoaledi. Mini also pioneered the fight against corruption which was evident and rampant during the Presidency of Jacob Zuma and headed the investigations on health insurance industry amid allegations of corrupt ties between the council officials of the Council of Medical Schemes and related firms.  Death  Mini was admitted to the hospital in Johannesburg on 28 March 2020 after falling ill with a prolonged asthma. He was admitted to the hospital a day after South African government imposed a nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. His test reports initially reported negative for the coronavirus. However he was tested positive for COVID-19 and died on 12 May 2020 at the age of 68 after being hospitalized for more than a month. Spokesperson of the Office of Health Standards Compliance, Ricardo Mahlakanya led the tributes from the front calling him a \\"champion in the fight against the HIV epidemic, Mini was a great servant of the nation in the medical fraternity, steadfast and always shared the utmost insight in the field with anyone he would strike a conversation with\\". Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku stated \\"health sector lost a foot soldier who was a tireless champion of universal health courage for all\\". Health minister Zweli Mkhize also attended the funeral, adding that \\"Mini was a true patriot who loved South Africa\\". His funeral was attended by only a handful of 50 people due to the restrictions imposed by the government to maintain health guidelines.

The palazzo is located in the Cannaregio district and overlooks the Cannaregio Canal. History This palace, one among the most imposing of the Cannaregio Canal, was built in the 17th century by the will of the patrician family of the Surians (of Armenian origin), to a project attributed to the architect Giuseppe Sardi, an author of the nearby Palazzo Savorgnan. Towards the end of the same century, it was sold to the Bellotto family (of Brescia origin). In the 18th century, the palace became the seat of the French embassy; the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau lived there in 1743–1744 and worked as a secretary to the ambassador, Comte de Mantaigu. In the 19th century, after the fall of the Republic of Venice, the palace began a long period of decay, during which the sumptuous interiors, their original structure and decorations were irreparably lost. The palace is visible in the View of the Cannaregio Canal painted by Francesco Guardi around 1770. Palazzo Surian Bellotto is currently a private home and is offered for sale. Architecture The best preserved and most important part of palazzo is the large Baroque façade, which, with its high four floors, stands above the nearby buildings. The facade is asymmetrical, having the central axis moved to the left; this is where the most valuable openings are located. On the ground floor of the short wing there are two arched portals decorated with mascarons inserted in rusticated bands. The pairs of serlianas on the two noble floors correspond to them. The seriana on the second floor is partially walled-up. All other openings are large single windows with stone frames recalling the motifs of the serlianas. The long wing also has a ground portal. All the windows on the noble floors are equipped with balustrades and mascarons. The fourth floor has a band of smaller rectangular windows. The facade levels are underlined by elaborate string courses; the top terminates with a dentiled cornice.

These affect the ability of all interconnected system devices in the electromagnetic environment, by restricting or limiting their intentional generation, propagation and reception of electromagnetic energy. Fig. 1. Conducted Emission propagation from Source to Receptor Conducted emissions consist a part of electromagnetic interference in circuits that mainly create issues in delivered power quality, owing to interference caused by harmonics arising due to linear & non linear loads present in the electric system mainly due to increasing presence of switched mode power supply and other consumer electronics. Due to these aggregated interferences, the delivered electric power quality from the mains electricity system affects the performance of electrical home appliances. These could include a decrease in lumen output of bulbs, flicker and poor heating of induction coil in kettles, heating elements other home appliances in every-day use. Following the effects of conducted emissions, the electric power quality is classified separately in common AC mains and DC mains systems. Since alternating current technology has been well established, the parameters and the effects in power quality in AC are well established. The parameter for measuring AC power quality is called is termed total harmonic distortion (%THD), and it measures the power quality of power supply for different voltage levels. Due to the recent developments in DC technology, the interconnections between DC and AC mains give rise to harmonic issues not previously experienced. Especially, the effects in DC power quality due to conducted emissions are not well understood. Moreover, the interconnections of AC and DC mains has given rise to further electromagnetic interference issues not previously known. Based on the current EMC standards, conducted emissions are measured from 150 kHz and 30 MHz, however there exists a gap in the electric power quality measured up to 2 kHz and the conducted emissions in the low frequency up to 150 kHz. The gap frequency range is termed Supraharmonics. Further, following the advancements in telecommunications engineering, the presence of electronic devices has gradually increased in the AC mains grid network towards having more semiconductor based switch devices, giving rise to further electromagnetic interference issues due to conducted emissions in the near and far electromagnetic environment. The electric grid progressing towards becoming increasingly nonlinear system and newer issues in power quality are being addressed. Technically, conducted emissions may be described as noise in the electric current or voltage generated by the electrical appliance or its susceptibility to it. The main difference between signal noise and emissions is that noise exists in a finite energy signal while emission exists in finite power signal. As noise in measuring circuits gets filtered out using filters, the emission must be filtered at the device under test at either the AC Mains or the DC mains, depending on the device application. The emission source can exist from the source to the receptor and through the circuit where there is electron flow. Usually, the electrical appliance must be factory tested with standards for conducted emission as the list of common EMC test standards denotes. Moreover, different manufacturers hold different versions of these standards as fit best to their appliances and warranty schemes. Fig. 2. Conducted Emissions from a commercial DC buck converter Conducted Emissions in electric supply system could be described as non-linearity or deviations observed in electric parameters. In AC, the variations are observed in the harmonics, while in DC they are observed as non linearity observed in time- domain and unexpected frequency peaks in frequency domain. The effects of Conducted Emissions in power quality in AC mains are well established in IEC standards, particularly in IEC Std 519-2014. Further, conducted emissions in DC are from multiple sources including electronic devices, non linear loads and other rotating magnetic field devices. In electronic devices, these are mainly from the interactions in the RLC circuit and the switching frequency. When loads like motors and generators that have DC magnetic fields, the conducted emission are non linear and difficult to predict. Further, the effects of Conducted Emissions in DC power Quality is not well understood and is being researched extensively. Effects on electric power quality Electric power quality in AC Mains is well developed and established with empirical data gathered over a century. Many parameters exists to determine and calculate the harmonic along with the noise. Concerning DC mains, much of the DC technology research for electric power distribution was abandoned in 1920s after it was decided that AC alternating systems were to be applied over large distances. However, due to recent developments in photovoltaic system rooftop solutions and lesser electronic conversion stages required between AC & DC, researchers are now considering DC to be used to supply power to household appliances at low voltage and extra low voltage levels. Harmonics in AC Mains For alternating current technology has been well established in the modern world, the parameter for measuring conducted emissions is well understood and is called Total harmonic distortion (%THD). It measures power quality of AC mains for different voltage levels as described in common EMC test standards. By definition, the AC harmonic is a multiple of the electrical quantity (voltage or current) at multiples of the fundamental frequency of the system, produced by the action of non-linear loads such as rectifier, lighting, or saturated magnetic devices. Harmonic frequencies in the power grid are a frequent cause of power quality problems and can result in increased heating in the equipment and conductors, misfiring in variable speed drives, and torque pulsations in motors. Harmonics in DC Mains Unlike AC, DC has no fundamental frequency or period and hence there cannot be a multiple of the fundamental frequency over which harmonics can be calculated. Further, the frequency range over which DC harmonics are calculated might not be the same as AC harmonics. Much of research covering DC harmonics suggest use of a percentage Low Frequency Sinusoidal Disturbance (%LFSD). This quantity measures the deviations that the DC quantity (voltage or current) over a specified measurement window or an analysis window in a frequency range. The percentage of root of squared summations of these deviations gives a total %LFSD value, which is a near equivalent of the %THD value in AC systems. Further, the DC harmonics are being studied in two frequency bandwidth as per the interference observed empirically. Fig. 3. Supaharmonics from DC buck converter Other issues with Power Quality in DC mains are to do with frequency range for conducted emissions in the electromagnetic spectrum. In the range of 0–2 kHz, commonly termed as garbage band, the DC harmonic quantity is calculated using an analogue of AC harmonics in frequency domain. However, as per the expected interactions between AC and DC systems and due to presence of power electronic devices and switched-mode power supply, the frequency range 2–150 kHz, recently termed as Supraharmonics is being researched. It is primarily understood that due to presence of electronic switching non-linear loads, the filter circuits tend to push emissions away into higher frequency bands. *Garbage Band This frequency bandwidth is in the range of 0–2 kHz and is equivalent to the same frequency range as AC harmonics. The name suggest that lower amount of conducted emissions are expected due to advancements in filters. It is widely accepted among researchers that the %LFSD value should be sufficient to address the DC harmonics and relate to the %THD in AC harmonics. *Supraharmonics This frequency bandwidth is in the range of 2–150 kHz and is termed as Supraharmonics. The frequency bandwidth was previously ignored and was considered as a gap between radiated emission and conducted emission. The current research suggest that much effort is being given to understand measurement methods for supraharmonic emissions in order to further standardize DC power quality to include short circuits, voltage variations and other factors as well. As per Thais.M.Mendes et. al, the effects of Supraharmonic emissions are confined to neighboring devices and do not propagate over long distances. Defining the measurement window and analysis window is one of the appropriate way to standardize conducted emissions. Measurements as per IEC 61000-4-7, IEC 61000-4-30, IEC-61000-4-19 and other CISPR standards show that each method can be effective but have its own limitations. Further, as per M.Klattt et.al measurement windows should be used in standardizing the framework for supraharmonic standards. Moreover, V.Khokhlov et.al suggests that all the existing standards have limitations that can be overcome by combining time-based analysis with frequency domain analysis.

There are two types of black box model of power converter - when the model includes the load, it is called terminated model, otherwise un-terminated model. The type of black box model of power converter is chosen based on the goal of modeling. This black box model of power converter could be a tool for filter design of a system integrated with power converters. To successfully implement a black box model of a power converter, the equivalent circuit of the converter is assumed a-priori, with the assumption that this equivalent circuit remains constant under different operating conditions. The equivalent circuit of the black box model is built by measuring the stimulus/response of the power converter. Different modeling methods of power converter could be applied in different circumstances. The white box model of power converters is suitable when all the inner components are known, which can be quite difficult due to the complex nature of the power converter. The grey box model combines some features from both, black box model and white box model, when parts of components are known or the relationship between physical elements and equivalent circuit is investigated.  Assumption  Since the power converter consists of power semiconductor device switches, it is a nonlinear and time-variant system. One assumption of black box model of a power converter is that the system is regarded as linear system when the filter is designed properly to avoid saturation and nonlinear effects. Another strong assumption related to the modeling procedure is that the equivalent circuit model is invariant under different operating conditions. Since in the modeling procedures circuit components are determined under different operating conditions.  Equivalent circuit  The expression of a black box model of power converter is the assumed equivalent circuit model (in frequency domain), which could be easily integrated in the circuit of a system in order to facilitate the process of filter design, control system design and pulse-width modulation design. In general, the equivalent circuit contains mainly two parts: active components like voltage/current sources, and passive components like impedance. The process of black box modeling is actually a approach to determine this equivalent circuit for the converter. Six equivalent circuits types of power converter's black box model  Active components  The active components in equivalent circuit are voltage/current sources. They are usually at least two sources, which could be variety options depending on the analysis approach, such as two voltage sources, two current sources, and one voltage and one current source.  Passive components The passive components containing resistors, capacitors and inductors can be expressed as combination of several impedances or admittances. Another expression method is to regard the passive components of the power converter as a two-port network and use a Y-matrix or Z-matrix to describe the characteristics of passive components.  Modeling method  Different modeling methods can be utilized to define the equivalent circuit. It depends on the chosen equivalent circuit and the optional measurement techniques. However, many modeling methods need at least one or more assumption mentioned above in order to regard the systems as linear time- invariant system or periodically switched linear system.  One example of modeling method This method is based on the two assumptions mentioned in section Assumption, so the system is regarded as linear time-invariant system. Based on these assumptions, the equivalent circuit could be derived from several equations of different operating conditions. The equivalent circuit model is defined containing three impedances and two current sources, where five unknown parameters needs to be determined. Three sets of different operating conditions are built up by changing external impedance and the corresponding currents and voltages at the terminals of the power converter are measured or simulated as known parameters. In each condition, two equations containing five unknown variables could be derived according to Kirchhoff's circuit laws and nodal analysis. In total, six equations could be used to solve these five unknowns and the equivalent circuit could be determined in this way.  Other methods to determine passive elements There are many methods used to determine passive elements. The conventional method is to switch off the power converter and measure the impedance with an impedance analyzer, or measure the scattering parameters by a vector network analyzer and compute the impedance afterwards. These conventional methods assume that the impedances of power converter is the same in the operating condition and switched-off condition. Many state-of-art methods are investigated to measure the impedance when the power converter is in operating condition. One method is to put two clamp-on current probes in the system, in which one is called receiving probe and another is injecting probe. The output of two probes are connected on a vector network analyzer, the impedance of power converter is measured after some calibration procedures in CM and DM measurement setups. This method is restricted with its delicate calibration procedure. Another state-of-art method is to utilize a transformer and an impedance analyzer in two different setups in order to measure CM and DM impedance separately. The measurement range of this method is limited by the characteristics of the transformer.

If more than one ABS is involved in such a relaying mechanism the so- called fly ad-hoc network (FANET) is established. FANETs are an aerial form of wireless ad hoc networks (WANET)s or mobile ad hoc networks (MANET)s. To provide \\"connectivity from the sky\\" is one of the innovative aspects of the 5G network. A strategic difference of ABSs with respect to the static classical network architecture is their ability to deploy on-demand networks at specific locations, thanks to their in-built properties of mobility, flexibility in three-dimensional space, adaptive altitude, and symmetric rotation. These characteristics allow to offer to ground users premium services with high quality wireless links, poor degradation, high capacity and low interference. From an industry point of view, different use cases have been planned for ABS network deployment in order to provide connectivity during temporary events and emergency situations, and in zones or rural areas without pre-existing solid network infrastructure. Unmanned aerial vehicles in wireless communications UAV were born only for military aims. Thanks to the evolution of the manufacturing technology, nowadays, it is one of the candidate solutions to provide on-demand connectivity in 5G network systems. History UAVs, more commonly identified as drones, are small aircraft or balloons than can be controlled in a remote manner by a radio control/RF module or using intelligent on-board systems that make the drone autonomous, simply cooperating with the network infrastructure and without human interaction. Historically, UAVs were only considered as expensive toys, thus, they were mainly used for military purposes such as cargo delivery, remote surveillance, armed attacks, and to reduce the soldiers losses in harsh territory since only a remote human pilot with a radiofrequency control was involved. The primitive use of a UAV was recorded at Venice in 1849 when the Austrians attacked Italy using unmanned balloons furnished with explosives. Applications of UAVs were also present during the first and second world wars. Thanks to the advancement of on-board sensors and manufacturing technologies, in the second half of the twentieth century, UAVs were also used for espionage and hostage search using wireless sensors. In the early 2000s, both the costs and the size reduced, thus, UAVs civilian and commercial applications started to be predominant, allowing a myriad of uses in the wireless communications field with the support of the existing network architecture, such as package delivery and traffic control in smart city context, or precision agriculture and terrain inspection in Industry 4.0. It is worth noting that in all these scenarios UAVs work as aerial user equipments (UEs), in coexistence with the classical ground users of the network, and not as an integrated part of the network infrastructure itself. Such a wireless technology is generally referred as cellular-connected UAVs. Amazon Air and Google’s project Wing initiatives are prominent examples of cellular-connected UAVs use cases. In recent years, due to the continuous miniaturization of components of wireless communication apparatus, the idea of equipping UAVs with radio frequency transceivers and dedicated hardware, to provide reliable, cost-effective, and on-demand wireless links to users on the ground, has started to be a reality. Nowadays, It is possible to find transceivers with a weight less than 2 kilograms, such as universal software radio peripheral integrated with software-defined radio, which can be easily mounted on the aircraft using a 3D printed support. The new concept of UAV-assisted wireless communications is a promising technology to support the fast-growing wireless data traffic. As a result of industry testing and academic research, ABSs are identified as an important component of 5G and beyond network. Key and challenging aspects The integration of ABSs or FANETs into wireless cellular networks as aerial communication platforms brings new network infrastructure design possibilities and challenging aspects to take into account. Indeed, there are many differences compared to the terrestrial counterpart. * high altitude: the typical height of terrestrial BSs is around 10-20 meters in an urban scenario, whereas the current regulation allows the ABSs to hover up to 100-120 meters. This enables the ABS to achieve broader coverage compared to classical terrestrial infrastructure and reduce the interference from other terminals. In fact, the ground terminals can be easily discernible at different altitudes and elevation angles measured with respect to the ABS; * 3D high mobility and user tracking: ABS can provide a higher line of sight (LoS) channel probability than classical ground-to-ground communications that generally suffer more path loss attenuation and fading effects. ABSs transceivers can track the moving users (pedestrian, connected vehicles or Internet of things devices) maintaining a stable LoS connection. There are several advantages of such condition. For instance, in 5G networks, millimeter-waves are employed and LoS is vital for providing connectivity at these frequency bandwidths. Moreover, LoS condition enables effective beamforming in the 3D space, making ABSs suitable candidates for the so-called 3D MIMO; * FANETs are scalable networks where the number of involved ABSs can be changed dynamically and based on use-case. Usually information among ABSs in FANETs is exchanged using the 802.11p protocol used for vehicular communications. The term ad-hoc refers to the fact that FANETs are characterized by a decentralized routing protocol for data information transmission; * energy-efficient design: ABSs, and UAVs in general, are really energy limited systems; this aspect poses critical bounds on their hovering and flight time, and some trade off can arise in terms of quality of services provided to user (i.e. transmitted power) and energy constrains; * security and surrounding environment health: the ABSs and their sensors need to be continually monitored to avoid incidents and maintain safety distance with others aerial vehicles, buildings, and obstacles. For this purpose, a control link is established with the terrestrial backhaul network; * privacy and data protection: the information collected by the on- board sensors are an issue in terms of both individuals and businesses privacy. Impact and applications scenarios ABSs allow a mobile operator/connectivity provider or network designers to create on demand networks in a bordered area that cater to particular clients and use cases. Lightweight, Commercial BSs are suitable to be mounted on UAVs with a moderate payload allowing a wide range of applications: *effectively accompaniment existing terrestrial systems in crowded areas (e.g., stadium during a sport event or live performances) by providing additional capacity; *information dissemination and collection in wireless sensor networks and IoT scenarios (smart city or in fields for terrain inspection and precision agriculture) where, due to low transmitted power of the devices, long range communications are not possible; *information transmission among geographically separated data centres or delivering network coverage in hard to reach rural or suburban areas, where deploying ABSs becomes highly advantageous compared to expensive telecommunications towers for BS or fiber links installation; *fast connectivity restoration after infrastructure failure or data relaying in emergency situations such as terroristic attacks. An example is the link between the frontline and the headquarters during such unpredictable situations; Models of such an innovative technology are provided by Qualcomm and AT&T; that have experimented the deployment of ABSs for enabling wide- scale wireless communications. Also, projects such as Facebook Aquila, cell- on-wheels and wings (COW-W), Google SKYBENDER, Nokia F-Cell, Huawei Digital Sky are aimed for testing the benefits of ABS services. Regulations One of the significant barriers of ABSs wireless communication technology is the absence of unique legal regulation. Policy differs among countries and zones. The regulations criteria can be split into two categories, the first related to UAV technology and the second related to telecommunications. Concerning UAVs, there are different agencies that develop guidelines for flight control. In the United States, operations are controlled by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In Europe, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published the regulation on the use of UAV. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is concerned with the Asia guideline for the regulation and safe operation of unmanned aircraft systems. Wireless communication regulations are being continuously developed by different organizations, such as the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) in Europe and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. The aim is to control the operations of ABS considering various factors such as ABS type and identification, frequency spectrum for data sharing and sensors control, altitude that depends on the presence of line of sight with the pilot, speed and weight. Architectures overview Although 3GPP is still concentrating its efforts on cellular-connected UAVs standardization, there are different proposed wireless architectures that involve flying systems carrying an intelligent router. The architecture involving ABSs is generally characterized by two basic types of communication links: the control and non-payload communications (CNPC) link and the data link. Control and non-payload communications link Control and non-payload communications link involves communications between the ABSs and ground control centres of the backhaul network that it is generally a specialized BS. CNPC link has mainly safety- critical functions, such as real-time control and obstacle collision avoidance. For this purpose, it needs more stringent latency and security requirements. Security and privacy are also prioritized to avoid unauthorized controllers. The CNPC link is also used for delivering information about the network configuration, which determines time and frequency resource allocation, and to collect some information about the ABSs's flight data (such as GPS, relative elevation angle, and flight speed), residual energy, and performances about the provide connectivity (such as [average [bit error rate , received and transmitted power). The frequency bandwidths allocated for this link are L-bands and C-bands since they do not suffer severe path loss, allowing a high reliability and low delay communications. Data link The data links involve the transmission of information data among mobile ground devices, terrestrial infrastructure (BS or gateway), sensors, and others ABSs. Since its scope is different compared to the CNPC, the requirements also vary. The data link is less delay-sensitive than the CNPC link, while the capacity request is generally application dependent. The data rate can range from kilobits per second in case of ABSs-ground users link, so that the 4G frequency bandwidth can be adopted, up to gigabits per second in case of ABS-backhaul network or ABS-ABS communications. Since these latter are mainly dominated by LoS component, the utilization of millimeter-wave bandwidth is a prominent solution for guaranteeing the high capacity requirement. Placement considerations The problem of finding an optimum location and/or path planning is more challenging for ABSs compared to the conventional terrestrial BSs. On one hand ABSs can freely move in 3D space without any borders, on the other hand, there are also variety of applied constraints that need to be considered, e.g., maintain LoS connectivity, energy limitation, and obstacles collision avoidance, many of which are time dependent and are difficult to predict. In most of the cases, the optimal solution is application-based. For instance, in case of cellular coverage ABSs-supported, the solution is to deploy static ABS that hovers above the centre of the area to be covered. In case of real time applications or moving devices, it is more intuitive to employ more than one ABSs to cooperatively achieve low delay and high reliability communications. Also in case of energy- aware deployment several ABSs need to cooperate letting the ABS to leave the serving area for energy replenishment, meanwhile the connectivity gap is filled by eighbouring ABSs, for example, via increasing the transmission power and/or adjusting the aircraft positions.

The Rashba–Edelstein effect (REE) is a spintronics-related effect, consisting in the conversion of a bidimensional charge current into a spin accumulation. This effect is an intrinsic charge-to-spin conversion mechanism and it was predicted in 1990 by the scientist V.M. Edelstein. It has been demonstrated in 2013 and confirmed by several experimental evidences in the following years. Its origin can be ascribed to the presence of spin-polarized surface or interface states. Indeed, a structural inversion symmetry breaking (i.e., a structural inversion asymmetry (SIA)) causes the Rashba effect to occur: this effect breaks the spin degeneracy of the energy bands and it causes the spin polarization being locked to the momentum in each branch of the dispersion relation. If a charge current flows in these spin-polarized surface states, it generates a spin accumulation. In the case of a bidimensional Rashba gas, where this band splitting occurs, this effect is called Rashba–Edelstein effect. For what concerns a class of peculiar materials, called topological insulators (TI), spin-splitted surface states exist due to the surface topology, independently from the Rashba effect. Topological insulators, indeed, display a spin-splitted linear dispersion relation on their surfaces (i.e., spin-polarized Dirac cones), while having a band gap in the bulk (this is why these materials are called insulators). Also in this case, spin and momentum are locked and, when a charge current flows in these spin-polarized surface states, a spin accumulation is produced and this effect is called Edelstein effect. In both cases, a 2D charge-to-spin conversion mechanism occurs. The reverse process is called inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect and it converts a spin accumulation into a bidimensional charge current, resulting in a 2D spin-to-charge conversion. The Rashba–Edelstein effect and its inverse effect are classified as a spin-charge interconversion (SCI) mechanisms, as the direct and inverse spin Hall effect, and materials displaying these effects are promising candidate for becoming spin injectors, detectors and for other future technological applications. The Rashba–Edelstein effect is a surface effect, at variance with the spin Hall effect which is a bulk effect. Another difference among the two, is that the Rashba–Edelstein effect is a purely intrinsic mechanism, while the spin Hall effect origin can be either intrinsic or extrinsic. Physical origin The origin of the Rashba–Edelstein effect relies on the presence of spin-split surface or interface states, which can arise for a structural inversion asymmetry or because the material exhibits a topologically protected surface, being a topological insulator. In both cases, the material surface displays the spin polarization locked to the momentum, meaning that these two quantities are univocally linked and orthogonal one to the other (this is clearly visible from the Fermi countours). It is worth noticing that also a bulk inversion asymmetry could be present, which would result in the Dresselhaus effect. In fact, if, in addition to the spatial inversion asymmetry or to the topological insulator band structure, also a bulk inversion asymmetry is present, the spin and momentum are still locked but their relative orientation is not straightforwardly determinable (since also the orientation of the charge current with respect to the crystallographic axes plays a relevant role). In the following discussion, the Dresselhaus effect will be neglected, for simplicity. Topological insulator band structure in equilibrium (a) and in a non equilibrium situation, when a spin-charge interconversion process occurs (b). Two possible effects could lead to the non-equilibrium situation: the injection of a charge current (i.e., a momentum unbalance) which is converted into a spin accumulation (Edelstein effect) or the injection of spins, resulting in a spin accumulation which produces a charge current (inverse Edelstein effect). The topological insulator case is easier to visualize due to the presence of a single Fermi countour, therefore the topological insulator case is discussed first. Topological insulators display spin-split surface states where spin-momentum locking is present. Indeed, when a charge current flows in the surface states of the topological insulator, it can also be seen as a well-defined momentum shift \\\\Delta k in the reciprocal space, resulting in a different occupation of the spin-polarized branches of the Dirac cone. This unbalance, accordingly to the structure of the topological insulator band dispersion relation, produces a spin accumulation in the investigated material, i.e., a charge-to-spin conversion occurs. The spin accumulation is orthogonal to the injected charge current, accordingly to spin-momentum locking. Due to the fact that these materials display a conductive behaviour on their surface while being insulating on their bulk, the charge current is only allowed to flow on the topological insulator surfaces: this is the origin of the bidimensionality of this charge-to-spin conversion mechanism. For what concerns the Rashba–Edelstein effect, the spin- split dispersion relation consists in two bands displaced along the k-axis due to a structural inversion asymmetry (SIA), accordingly to the Rashba effect (i.e., these bands show a linear splitting in k due to the spin-orbit coupling). This results in two Fermi countours, which are concentric at equilibrium, both displaying spin-momentum locking but with opposite helicity. If the system is driven in an out-of-equilibrium condition by injecting a charge current, the two disk displace one from the other and a net spin accumulation arises. This effect occurs, for instance, in a bidimensional Rashba gas. The Rashba splitting complicates the understanding and the visualization of the spin-to-charge conversion mechanism but the basic working principle of the Rashba–Edelstein effect is very similar to the one of the Edelstein effect. Experimentally speaking, the Rashba–Edelstein effect occurs if a charge current is electrically injected inside the topological insulator, for instance by means of two electrodes where a potential difference is applied. The resulting spin accumulation can be probed in several ways, one of them is by employing the magneto optical Kerr effect (MOKE). Inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect The reverse process, i.e., the inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect (I(R)EE) occurs when a spin accumulation is generated inside the investigated material and a consequent charge current arises on the material surface (in this case, we have a 2D spin-to-charge conversion). In order to have the inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect, a spin accumulation is required to be generated inside the analyzed material and this spin injection is usually achieved by coupling the material under investigation with a ferromagnet in order to perform the spin pumping or with a semiconductor where it is possible to perform optical orientation. As for the direct effect, the inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect occurs in materials lacking the structural inversion symmetry, while in topological insulators the inverse Edelstein effect arises. In the case of the inverse Edelstein effect, by looking at the section of the Dirac cone, the spin-to-charge conversion can be visualized as follows: the spin injection produces a piling up of spins of one character in one of the energy dispersion relation branches. This results in a spin unbalance due to the different branch occupations (i.e., a spin accumulation), which leads to a momentum unbalance and, therefore, to a charge current which can be electrically probed. As for the direct effect, also in the inverse Edelstein effect, the charge current can only flow on the topological insulator surfaces due to the energy band conformation. This is how the 2D spin-to-charge conversion occurs in these materials and this could allow topological insulators to be exploited as spin detectors. As for the direct effect, this analysis has been carried out for the inverse Edelstein effect because in this case only two energy branches are present. For what concerns the inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect, the process is very similar despite the presence of four energy branches, with spin-momentum locking, in the dispersion relation and two consequent Fermi countours with opposite helicity. In this case, the two Fermi countours, when a spin accumulation is generated inside the material, will be displaced one from the other, generating a charge current, at variance with the equilibrium case in which the two Fermi countours are concentric and no net momentum unbalance nor spin accumulation are present. Process efficiency While both the Rashba–Edelstein effect and the inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect rely on a spin accumulation, the figure of merit of the processes is commonly computed by accounting for the spin current density related to the spin accumulation, instead of the spin accumulation itself, in analogy with the spin Hall angle for the spin Hall effect. Indeed, the efficiency of the Rashba–Edelstein effect and of the inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect can be estimated by means of the Rashba–Edelstein length, i.e., the ratio between the charge current density, flowing on the surface of the investigated material, (i.e., a surface charge current density) and the three-dimensional spin current density (since the spin accumulation can diffuse in the three-dimensional space). In the Rashba–Edelstein effect the spin current is a consequence of the spin accomulation that occurs in the material as the charge current flows on its surface (under the influence of a potential difference and, therefore, of an electric field), while in the inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect the spin current is the quantity injected inside the material leading to a spin accumulation and resulting in a charge flow localized at the material surface. In both cases, the asymmetry in the charge and spin current dimensions results in a ratio which dimensionally has the units of a length: this is the origin of the name of this efficiency parameter. Analytically, the value of the bidimensional charge current density can be computed employing the Boltzmann equation and considering the action of an electric field \\\\mathbf{E}, resulting in: :\\\\mathbf{j} = -\\\\frac{q^2 \\\\tau_{\\\\rm m} k_{\\\\rm F} v_{\\\\rm F}}{4 \\\\pi^2 \\\\hbar}\\\\mathbf{E}, where q is the elementary charge, \\\\tau_{\\\\rm m} is the momentum scattering time, k_{\\\\rm F} and v_{\\\\rm F} are, respectively, the Fermi wavevector and the Fermi velocity and \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck constant. The spin current density can be also analytically computed by integrating across the Fermi surface the product of the spin polarization and the corresponding distribution function. In the Edelstein effect case, this quantity results in: :\\\\mathbf{j_{s}} = -\\\\frac{q^2 k_{\\\\rm F}}{4 \\\\pi^2 \\\\hbar}\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{n}, where \\\\mathbf{n} is the unit vector perpendicular to the surface on which the charge current flows. From these formula it can be observed the orthogonality of the spin and the charge current densities. For what regards the Edelstein and its inverse effects, the conversion efficiency is: :\\\\lambda_{\\\\rm EE} = \\\\frac{j}{j_{s}} = \\\\tau_{\\\\rm m} v_{\\\\rm F}. This parameter is conventionally positive for a Fermi countour with a counterclockwise helicity. The Rashba–Edelstein length derivation is the same as the Edelstein one, except for v_{\\\\rm F} which is substituted by the Rashba parameter \\\\alpha_{\\\\rm R}, i.e., v_{\\\\rm F} \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{\\\\rm R}}{\\\\hbar}, resulting in: :\\\\lambda_{\\\\rm REE} = \\\\frac{j}{j_{s}} = \\\\frac{\\\\tau_{\\\\rm m} \\\\alpha_{\\\\rm R}}{\\\\hbar}. The Rashba–Edelstein length of the investigated material can be compared to other spin-charge interconversion efficiencies, as the spin-Hall angle, to establish if this material is an efficient spin-charge interconverter, and, therefore, if it could be suitable for spintronic applications. The Rashba–Edelstein length (2D spin-charge interconversion efficiency) can be effectivly compared to the spin Hall angle (3D spin-charge interconversion efficiency), by dividing the \\\\lambda_{\\\\rm REE} parameter for the thickness of the spin-splitted surface states in which this 2D conversion occurs. This \\"equivalent\\" spin Hall angle for the Rashba–Edelstein effect often results in being close to the unity or even greater than the unity: the Rashba–Edelstein effect, on average, is a more efficient spin-charge interconversion mechanism than the spin Hall effect and this could lead to a future employment of materials displaying this effect in the technological industry.

It combines in a single non-invasive tool the capability to implement breast cancer risk assessment, lesion characterization, therapy monitoring and prediction of therapy outcome. It is an application of diffuse optics, which studies light propagation in strongly diffusive media, such as biological tissues, working in the red and near- infrared spectral range, between 600 and 1100 nm.  Comparison with conventional imaging techniques  Currently, the most common breast imaging techniques are X-ray mammography, ultrasounds, MRI and PET. X-ray mammography is widely spread for breast screening, thanks to its high spatial resolution and the short measurement time. However, it is not sensitive to the breast physiology, it is characterized by a limited efficiency in investigating dense breasts and it is harmful due to the use of ionizing radiation. Ultrasounds are non-invasive and they are used especially on young women, who are usually characterized by dense breasts, but the images interpretation depends on the operator's experience. MRI shows a good correlation with the tumour dimensions and is claimed to be the best method for the identification and characterization of lesions. Even though there is no verified long-term health risk from the magnetic fields employed during an MRI, it is not used as first investigative tool because of the high costs and the elevated duration of the exam. Finally, PET allows the early evaluation of the metabolic changes of the tumour, but it is very expensive and requires the administration of a radioactive tracer. For this reason, its application is not frequently recommended. On the contrary, optical mammography is cheap, efficient also on dense breasts, and devoid of any side effect, so that it can be used to track the evolution of the patient's condition on a daily basis. It is also able to characterize breast from a physiologic point of view. However, being still under development, there is a lack of standardization in data analysis among the research groups dealing with it, and it suffers from low spatial resolution. For this reason, a \\"multimodal approach\\" is suggested, where optical mammography is complementary to another conventional technique, so that also the diagnostic efficacy is improved.  Physical mechanism = Photon migration in diffusive media  Biological tissues are diffusive media, which means that light attenuation during propagation is due not only to absorption, but also to scattering. The former is related to the chemical composition of the medium and induces photon annihilation, whereas the latter depends on the microscopic inhomogeneities of its refractive index and determines deviations in photon's trajectory. The absorption coefficient \\\\mu_a represents the probability per unit length that an absorption event takes place, while the scattering coefficient \\\\mu_s denotes the probability per unit length that a scattering event occurs. However, many studies refer to the reduced scattering coefficient \\\\mu_s^'=\\\\mu_s (1-g) rather than the simple scattering coefficient, in order to take into account the medium's anisotropy. The medium's anisotropy is represented by the factor g, which is the average cosine of the angular deflection. Light propagation through highly diffusive media is typically described through the heuristic approach of the radiative transport theory, sided by the so-called “diffusion approximation”: scattering is assumed to be isotropic and strongly dominant over absorption. This is fairly accurate for example for the breast tissue, in the red and near infrared spectral range (between 600 and 1100 nm), known also as \\"therapeutic window\\". In the therapeutic window, light can penetrate a few centimetres, so that it can explore the volume at exam. This is the reason why photon migration in biological tissues is known also as \\"diffuse optics\\". The relation between reduced scattering coefficient and wavelength (\\\\lambda) derives from the Mie theory: \\\\mu'_s = a \\\\left( \\\\frac{ \\\\lambda}{\\\\lambda_0}\\\\right)^{-b} Experimental breast constituent's normalized absorption spectra. Hb stands for deoxy-hemoglobin, HbO2 for oxy-hemoglobin. where \\\\lambda_0 is the reference wavelength and b and a refer to the size of the scattering centres and their density, respectively. Regarding the absorption coefficient, the relation with \\\\lambda is mediated by the so-called “extinction coefficient” \\\\epsilon_i(\\\\lambda), that in combination with the Lambert-Beer law gives \\\\mu_a = \\\\sum_{i} \\\\epsilon_i (\\\\lambda) C_i where C_i is the concentration of the i breast constituent. Measuring \\\\mu_a at different wavelengths, the breast constituents’ concentrations can be extrapolated.  Breast constituents' absorption spectra  The main breast constituents are oxy and deoxy-hemoglobin, water, lipids and collagen. In particular, collagen has been recognized as an independent risk factor for developing breast cancer. Blood strongly absorbs in the red spectral range, whereas collagen, water and lipids have their absorption peaks at wavelengths longer than 900 nm. The distinction between oxy and deoxy-haemoglobin is due to the presence of a second large peak in the case of oxy-haemoglobin. Lipids are characterized by absorption maxima at 930 nm and 1040 nm, while the wavelength 975 nm is sensitive to water. Finally, an absorption peak for collagen takes place at 1030 nm.  Possible implementations  Diffuse optical mammography can be implemented exploiting three different approaches: time domain, frequency domain and continuous wave. Moreover, there exist two main geometries to perform an optical measurement: *Reflectance: injection and collection occur on the same side of the breast. The woman is usually prone or bent forward and places the breast on a support provided with a hole where sources and detectors are located. Other systems' setups instead require the woman to lie supine and the measurement is carried out with a hand-held probe. *Transmittance: injection and collection occur on opposite sides of the breast. The breast is usually compressed between plane parallel plates. Whatever the chosen approach is, any optical mammograph must comprehend some essential elements: laser sources, a detector, a signal processor. The use of multiple laser sources allows to investigate the breast constituents' concentrations of interest, by selecting some specific wavelengths. Detectors are usually photomultiplier tubes or avalanche photodiodes. Finally, the signal processor could be a device for Time-correlated single photon counting in the case of a time-resolved optical mammograph, or a filter for frequency modulation in the case of frequency-domain ones. Based on the number and position of sources and detectors, an optical mammograph can produce bidimensional or three-dimensional breast constituents' maps.  Time domain  In time-domain measurements, short light pulses of the order of hundreds of picoseconds are delivered to the breast and its optical properties are retrieved from the features of the re-emitted pulses, which have undergone delay, broadening and attenuation. Time-correlated single photon counting is fundamental to cope with the low-level output signal.  Frequency domain  In frequency-domain measurements, an intensity-modulated signal is injected into the breast and its optical properties are deduced from the dephasement and the demodulation of the output signal with respect to the input one. The measurement is repeated for different values of the frequency modulation.  Continuous wave  In continuous wave (CW) measurements, the light source is a continuous wave laser, which hinders the separation of the absorption and scattering contributions with a single measurement. A possible solution is to perform space or angle-resolved measurements. In general, the CW approach is combined with the frequency domain one, in order to reinforce the strengths of both.  Potential applications = Breast cancer risk assessment  A denser breast is more likely to develop breast cancer. A dense breast is characterized by a meaningful amount of fibrous tissue, relatively to the adipose one. The main constituents of a fibrous tissue are water, collagen and hemoglobin and optical mammography is able to discriminate and quantify tissues' components. Therefore, by measuring breast constituents' concentrations, optical mammography could assess breast cancer risk.  Lesion characterization  Tumours are generally made of fibrous tissue and could be recognized in the constituents' maps as local spots with higher concentrations of water, collagen and hemoglobin with respect to the surrounding, mostly adipose, healthy tissues. Studies demonstrate that the variation in concentration with respect to the healthy tissue is statistically more marked in the case of malignant tumours than benign ones. In addition, the scattering coefficient is generally higher for benign lesions. Such distinctions suggest that optical mammography could characterize breast lesions.  Therapy monitoring and prediction of therapy outcome  Breast cancer management depends on the characteristics of the tumour and the patient's condition. One of the possible strategies is the administration of neoadjuvant therapy, whose goal is to shrink the tumour size before surgery. Studies show that if the therapy is efficient, then the water, collagen and hemoglobin contents of the lesion show a decreasing behaviour over time, which suggests that the initially fibrous tissue acquires features similar to the adipose one. Optical measurements in correspondence with therapy sessions could track its evolution, so to assess the patient's response to it. Moreover, it is believed that therapy effectiveness could be predicted even on the first day of treatment on the base of initial breast constituents' concentrations.

It was established in 2006 as part of the European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI) of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The goal of the European Helicopter Safety Team was to contribute to reducing the worldwide helicopter accident rate by 80% in the time-span 2006-2016, which was set as a goal by the International Helicopter Safety Team (IHST) in 2006. Focusing on European helicopter operators and manufacturers, the European Helicopter Safety Team conducted helicopter accident analyses, provided technology potential studies, and published safety management and training documents.  Organization  European Helicopter Safety Team (EHEST) organization in European and international helicopter safety initiatives Members of the European Helicopter Safety Team were helicopter manufacturers, regulators, and operators, as well of multiple accident investigation bodies, research organisations, and pilot associations, originating from EASA member states and members of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). Within the European Helicopter Safety Team, there were two distinct working groups: the European Helicopter Safety Analysis Team (EHSAT) and the European Helicopter Safety Implementation Team (EHSIT). The European Helicopter Safety Analysis Team published helicopter accident analysis reports, while the European Helicopter Safety Implementation Team aimed to support helicopter operations by providing generalized checklists, manuals, and supplementary safety information, by investigating how technology can contribute to an increase in safety, and by supplying training and educational material. The work of both teams is available in EASA's safety promotion database. The European Helicopter Safety Team has been closed as of the year 2016. Its work is utilized and continued through the European Safety Promotion Network - Rotorcraft (ESPN-R), within the scope of EASA. From 2006 until 2016, the European Helicopter Safety Team was the European part of the International Helicopter Safety Team (IHST). In 2019, the International Helicopter Safety Team was renamed the International Helicopter Safety Foundation (IHSF), reflecting its more permanent safety role in the international helicopter operation community. The European Safety Promotion Network - Rotorcraft now coordinates its efforts with the International Helicopter Safety Foundation.  Accident analysis reports  The European Helicopter Safety Analysis Team compiled two accident analysis reports, covering 325 helicopter accidents in the time-frame 2000-2005, and 162 helicopter accidents in the time-frame 2006-2010, respectively. The analyses were conducted by regional teams of Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Accidents were analysed utilizing Standard Problem Statements (SPS) and the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Most analysed accidents occurred during general aviation helicopter flights (44%). 30% of accidents occurred during aerial work (for example, trimming flora around power lines with an aerial saw), 22% of accidents during commercial air transport. Only 4% of accidents occurred during non-military state flights. 24% of accidents resulted in fatal injuries, 13% in serious injuries. Minor injuries were reported in 20% of cases, 43% of accidents caused no injuries at all. In most cases (48%), the helicopter was destroyed, in 44% of cases, the sustained damage was substantial. In only 8% of accidents, the aircraft damage was minor or nonexistent. The five largest high-level Standard Problem Statements contributing to accidents are: * pilot judgment & actions * safety management * ground duties * pilot situation awareness * data issues  Technology potential studies  The European Helicopter Safety Implementation Team developed the Safety Issues Matrix-tool in order to evaluate the potential of technology to increase safety, based on the accident analysis carried out by the European Helicopter Safety Analysis Team. The analysis followed the assumption that by providing novel and improved technological support in certain operational areas, the identified SPS could be avoided, or their impact on safety lessened. The final report identifies 15 highly promising technologies to increase safety: * terrain awareness / ground proximity warning system * digital range image algorithms, to support low-level flight and provide flight guidance * obstacle and terrain avoidance system (laser radar-based) * digital map * voice and flight data recorder (deployable) * obstacle collision avoidance system (passive, tower-based) * voice and flight data recorder (miniature) * wire strike protection system * evaluation and processing of flight data for accident/incident investigation * cockpit information recorder (camera, microphone, GPS) * Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) * Helicopter Operations Monitoring Program (HOMP) for light helicopters * on-board flight performance modelling (through efficient numerical approaches) * radar altimeter * immersive visualization to support accident analyses  Publications for operators = Safety management system and operations tool-kits  The European Helicopter Safety Implementation Team published safety management tool-kits for helicopter operators, as well as tools and checklists for risk-assessment and instructional videos. These documents are intended to support helicopter operators to set up and maintain their own individual safety management systems, tailored to their specific operational profile.  Training and educational documents  The European Helicopter Safety Implementation Team published several training leaflets and instructional material. Flight instructor guides and manuals are provided, as well as a graphical overview of ground operation signals and instructional videos about decision-making, Degraded Visual Environments (DVE, for example caused by brownout) and loss of control, operating in the vicinity of electric utility infrastructure, and passenger management for pilots and passengers. A template for a pre-flight planning checklist is provided, as well.

The virtual dialouge can be created by two ways, the usage of virtual technics, and the narrative like reading a book. The motivations of using virtual reality (VR) for teaching contain: learning efficiency, time problems, physical inaccessibility, limits due to a dangerous situation and ethical problems.  Types of immersive learning = Technical aspect  Most of the immersive learning activities are supported by virtual tools including Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual reality (VR) and Virtual learning environment (VLE). While talking about immersive VR, here specifically refer to the occasions where participants feel \\"being there\\" into a virtual place. For educational purpose, the most mentioned virtual projects include Second Life, CAVE VR system, AET Zone are being used in a wide range of disciplines. Among all the technical tools supporting immersive learning, the CAVE, which defined as a room-like environment with projection screens is well discussed. The CAVE was first studied by the University of Illinois's Electronic Visualization Lab in 1992, which allows huge screens to involve a large number of audiences. Sherman and Craig define CAVE as a theater-like VR venue, which is visually created by computer-generated imagery. Most of the CAVEs today contain 3-6 walls (including ceiling and floor), shaped as a cube or cylinder. It is supported with multisensory channels for human-content interaction, mainly visual, also produces other sensory engagements such as tactile, audio and smell. At this stage, visual and spatial audio appear to be the most-used combination to achieve a certain level of immersion.  Cognitive aspect  The word \\"Textual immersion\\" is used to describe this kind of cognitive immersion, as everyone has the so-called daydream, to image themselves actually being in the story and become the protagonist. This phenomenon is described as getting lost, involved, or drawn into a story, by imagination or other media engagement such as literature and film. Immersion is also considered by Murray as an experience that create a more than reality world, which is structured by the audience's own cognition. Also, within Ryan's book, the cognitive immersion created by narrative is categorized into three kinds: Spatial immersion, Temporal immersion and Emotional Immersion. Sensory simulations play an essential role to achieve mental immersion, with the combination of primary and secondary senses. The audio engagement within visual stories is welcomed as a way to achieve Presence (telepresence), as music helps to arouse emotional factors such as happiness and anger, peacefulness and intense.  Areas of applications  For educational purposes, VR starts to engage as a teaching tool to convey knowledge in an immersive way. It takes the advantage from the characteristics belongs to VR such as engaging and entertaining, to teach art, history, geography and zoology. Among the purposes of learning, the educational theories vary from constructivist, constructionist, and situated. All the three types of learning are well served by VR, as it supports a wide range of free exploration and construction. In general, VR could also improve knowledge retention and student motivation.  Skill Training  Skill training here refers to the training with a certain level of professional skills for adults. Immersive learning supports the simulation of being in a dangerous or unusual environment, as a safe and effective way for training employees. For forklift truck training, the research team built an immersive CAVE-based VR to simulates the accidents. For the operator training, some plant scenarios such as routine operations and emergency response can be trained within the same CAVE-like space, it also allows multi-players to do the teamwork.  Medication  Immersive learning usually appears to simulate the accident which need immediate medical support, including heart attack and syncope. Practical studies can be found both in universities and medication agencies, in 3D stereo anatomy teaching, an immersive environment to learn anatomy is build for medical students. Instead of the boring 2D textbook, students are allowed to move the real human parts modelling with a monitor, the visual display also allow zoom-in to browse more details. Further related studies could be found in serval research agencies including Harvardmedsim, Autism Treatment and Healthy Simulation.  Art and Design  The needs of teaching art and design ask for a lower level of real-scene simulation, but a higher demand of emotional context and atmosphere. Virtual technics could benefit the teaching and learning activity as it provides essential support for exploration-based learning. Art exploration, which transforms the static art to dynamic art, see VR as a media of expression, also as an open place allow discussion and teamwork. Particularly, studies could be found in the area of innovative teaching to use VR as the tool.  Effectiveness of learning  The effectiveness of immersive learning appears in several ways: * The realistic simulation of real-life scenes to help with the emergency or unusual situations. * To simplify the complex contexts and enhance learning effectiveness. * Add playful and explorational contents compared with a flat 2D learning activity. * To encourage conceptual thinking, especially for art and design. * To reduce the noise from surrounded environment and social conflict. The immersive learning activity has a high level of compatibility, to allow complex teaching tasks including role-playing, free-exploration, narrative and after-course evaluation. In some occasions like medication and skill training, physical tool engagements are also functional to better simulate a real scene, such as use patient models in first aid period.  Online immersive tools = Narrative website  Narrative website is one of the typical online tools to support immersive learning. It usually appears in the area of visual storytelling, display page of exhibition and historical websites. The storytelling is well-designed to answer the needs of information dissemination and emotional resonance, usually with the support of visual, audio and dynamic design. For such use case, the Openlearn virtualized a story to enhance the user's sense of substitution by making choices, the Awge simulated a platform of game boy to get visitors immersed. And the Active Theory produces a controllable 3D modeling which could interact with the mouse.  Interactive video  Within immersive learning, interactive video usually remains as an instrument to make one website or platform interactive and fun. Under some educational purpose, interactive video could function as increasing learning interest and reducing the learning costs. Through clicking and dragging, the interactive video splits complex tasks into small and simple operations, the logic between small tasks is usually build through narrative. Typical examples could be found within the interactive video which introduce Virus, and the art study in Nexusstudios.

It is useful for applications in electrical energy storage (EES) in substitution of the liquid electrolytes found in particular in lithium-ion battery. The main advantages are the increased safety, no issues of leakages of toxic organic liquids, low flammability, non-volatility, mechanical and thermal stability, easy processability, low self-discharge, higher achievable power density and cyclability. This makes it possible, for example, the use of a lithium metal anode in a practical device, without the intrinsic limitations of a liquid electrolyte. The utilization of a high capacity anode and low reduction potential, like lithium with a specific capacity of 3860 mAh g−1 and a reduction potential of -3.04 V vs SHE, in substitution of the traditional low capacity graphite, which exhibits a theoretical capacity of 372 mAh g−1 in its fully lithiated state of LiC6 Polymer-Derived SiOC Integrated with a Graphene Aerogel As a Highly Stable Li-Ion Battery Anode Applied Materials and Interfaces 2020 , is the first step in the realization of a lighter, thinner and cheaper rechargeable battery. Moreover this allows the reach of gravimetric and volumetric energy densities, high enough to achieve 500 miles per single charge in an electric vehicle. Despite the promising advantages there are still some limitations that are hindering the transition of SSEs from academic research to large-scale production, however many car OEMs (Toyota, BMW, Honda, Hyundai) expect to integrate these systems into viable devices and to commercialize solid-state battery-based electric vehicles by 2025.  History  The first inorganic solid-state electrolytes were discovered by M. Faraday in the nineteenth century, the silver sulfide (Ag2S) and lead(II) fluoride (PbF2). The first polymeric material able to conduct ions at the solid-state was PEO, discovered in the 1970s by V. Wrigh. The importance of the discovery was recognized in the early of 1980s. However, unresolved fundamental issues remain in order to fully understand the behavior of all-solid batteries, especially in the area of electrochemical interfaces. In recent years the need of safety and performances improvements with respect to the state-of-the-art Li-ion chemistry are making solid-state batteries very appealable and are now considered an encouraging technology to satisfy the need for long range battery electric vehicles of the near future. In March 2020, the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) published the research on an all-solid-state battery (ASSB) using an argyrodite-based solid- state electrolyte with a demonstrated energy density of 900 Wh L−1 and a stable cyclability of more than 1000 cycles, reaching for the first time a value close to the 1000 Wh L−1.  Properties  In order to design a SSE with the optimal performances, several properties have to be met: * high ionic conductivity (at least higher than 10−4 S cm−1) that can be measured through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis * high ionic transference number (the closest possible to 1) that can be measure through a combination of chronoamperometry (CA) and EIS analysis * wide electrochemical stability windows (ESW) (at least 4-5 V) that can be measured through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) or cyclic voltammetry (CV) * high mechanical strength (at least tens of MPa) that can be measured through a traditional tensile test * high compatibility with the electrode material that can be measured through EIS analysis repeated over more consecutive days.  Categories  SSEs have the same role of a traditional liquid electrolyte and they are classified into all-solid-state electrolyte and quasi-solid-state electrolyte (QSSE). All- solid-state electrolytes are furthermore divided into inorganic solid electrolyte (ISE), solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) and composite polymer electrolyte (CPE). On the other hand, a QSSE, also called gel polymer electrolyte (GPE), is a freestanding membrane that contains a certain amount of liquid compontent immobilized inside the solid matrix. In general the nomenclatures SPE and GPE are used interchangeably but they have a substantially different ionic conduction mechanism: SPEs conducts ions through the interaction with the susbtitutional groups of the polymer chains, while GPEs conducts ions mainly in the solvent or plasticizer.  All-solid-state electrolyte  All-solid-state electrolyte are divided into inorganic solid electrolyte (ISE), solid polymer electrolite (SPE) and composite polymer electrolyte (CPE). They are solid at room temperature and the ionic movement occurs at the solid-state. Their main advantage is the complete removal of any liquid component aimed to a greatly enhanced safety of the overall device. The main limitation is the ionic conductivity that tends to be much lower compared to a liquid counterpart. * Inorganic solid electrolyte (ISE) Inorganic solid electrolyte (ISE) are a particular type of all-solid-state electrolyte that is constituted by an inorganic material in the crystalline or glassy state, that conducts ion by diffusion through the lattice. The main advantages of this class of solid-state electrolyte are the high ionic conductivity (of the order of few mS cm−2 at room-temperature), high modulus (of the order of GPa) and high transfer number compared to other classes of SSEs. They are generally brittle and with this comes a low compatibility and stability towards the electrode, with a rapidly increasing interfacial resistance and a complicated scale-up from academic to industry. They can be oxides, sulfides or phosphates-based and the crystalline structures include LISICON (lithium superionic conductor) (e.g. LGPS, LiSiPS, LiPS), argyrodite-like (e.g. Li6PS5X, X = Cl, Br, I), garnets (LLZO), NASICON (sodium superionic conductor) (e.g. LTP, LATP, LAGP), lithium nitrides (e.g. Li3N), lithium hydrides (LiBH4), perovskites (e.g. LLTO), lithium halides (LYC, LYB). Some ISEs can be glass ceramics assuming an amorfous state instead of a regular crystalline structure, popular examples are lithium phosporus oxynitride (LIPON) and the lithium thiophosphates (Li2S–P2S5). * Solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) Solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) are defined as a solvent-free salt solution in a polymer host material that conducts ions through the polymer chains. Compared to ISEs, SPEs are much easier to process, generally by solution casting, making them greatly compatibile with large-scale manufacturing processes. Moreover, they possess higher elasticity and plasticity giving stability at the interface, flexibility and improved resistance to volume changes during operation. A good dissolution of Li salts, low glass transition temperature (Tg), electrochemical compatibility with most common electrode materials, a low degree of crystallinity, mechanical stability, low temperature sensitivity are all characteristics for the ideal SPE candidate. In general though the ionic conductivity is lower than the ISEs and their rate capability is restricted, limiting fast charging. PEO-based SPE is the first solid-state polymer in which ionic conductivity was demonstrated both through inter and intra molecular through ion hopping, thanks to the segmental motion of the polymeric chains because of the great ion complexation capability of the ether groups, but they suffer from the low room-temperature ionic conductivity (10−5 S cm−1) due to the high degree of cristallinity. The main alternatives to polyether-based SPEs are polycarbonates, polyesters, polynitriles (e.g. PAN), polyalcohols (e.g. PVA), polyamines (e.g. PEI), polysiloxane (e.g. PDMS) and fluoropolymers (e.g. PVDF, PVDF-HFP). Bio-polymers like lignin, chitosan and cellulose are also gaining a lot of interest as standalone SPEs or blended with other polymers, on one side for their environmentally friendliness and on the other for their high complexation capability on the salts. Furthermore different strategies are considered to increase the ionic conductivity of SPEs and the amorfous-to-crystalline ratio. With the introduction of particles as fillers inside the polymer solution, a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) is obtained, the particles can be inert to the Li+ conduction (Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, MgO, zeolite, montmorillonite, ...), with the sole purpose of reducing the cristallinity, or active (LLTO, LLZO, LATP...) if ISE's particles are dispersed and depending on the polymer/inorganic ratio the nomenclature ceramic-in-polymer and polymer-in-ceramic is often used. Copolymerization, crosslinking, interpenetration, and blending may also be used as polymer/polymer coordination to tune the properties of the SPEs and achieve better performances, introducing in the polymeric chains polar groups like ethers, carbonyls or nitriles drastically improve the dissolution of the lithium salts.  Quasi-solid-state electrolyte  Often confused with SPEs, quasi-solid-state electrolytes (QSSEs) are also called gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), but they have a substantially different ionic conduction mechanism: SPEs conducts ions through the interaction with the susbtitutional groups of the polymer chains, while GPEs conducts ions mainly in the solvent or plasticizer. They consist of a polymer network swollen in a solvent that contains the active ions, so it possesses both the mechanical properties of solids and the high transport properties of liquids. Several GPEs with a number of polymer hosts have been studied, by using the same polymers as SPEs (e.g. PEO, PAN, PMMA, PVDF-HFP, ...), but synthetized with increased porosity in order to easily allocate a low-evaporation solvents like ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), used as plasticizers. Low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or other ethers or aprotic organic solvents with high dielectric constant like dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) can also be mixed the SPE matrix. UV and thermal crosslinking are useful ways to polymerize in-situ the GPE directly in contact with the electrodes for a perfectly adherent interface. Values of ionic conductivity of few mS cm−1 can be easily achieved with GPEs, as demonstrate the numerous research articles published on the argument.  Opportunities  The uncontrolled formation of lithium dendrites The versatility and properties of the solid-state electrolyte widen the possible applications towards high energy density and cheaper battery chemistries that are otherwise prevented by the current state-of-the-art of Li-ion batteries. Indeed, by introducing a SSE in the battery architecture there's the possibility to use metallic lithium as anode material, with the possibility to achieve a high energy density battery thanks to its high specific capacity of 3860 mAh g−1. The utilization of a lithium metal anode (LMA) is prevented in a liquid electrolyte above all because of the dendritic growth of a pure Li electrode that easily cause short circuits after few cycles; other related issues are volume expansions, solid- electrolyte-interface (SEI) reactivity and 'dead' lithium. The usage of a SSE guarantees a homogeneous contact with the metallic lithium electrode and possess the mechanical properties to impede the uncontrolled deposition of Li+ ions during the charging phase. At the same time, a SSE finds very promising application in lithium-sulfur batteries solving the key issue of the polysulfide \\"shuttle\\" effect by blocking the dissolution of polysulfide species in the electrolyte that rapidly causes a reduction of capacity.

The analysis of PV modules during production and operation is an important part in ensuring reliability and thus energy efficiency of the PV technology. Therefore, it is crucial for solar module quality assurance. During their life time, PV modules experience severe changes in weather and working conditions, leading to large temperature variations (day - night, summer - winter, irradiance) and mechanical stress (wind, snow, hail). This can lead to an enhanced degradation compared to the usual wearing-out of materials over time, resulting in degradation modes (DMs), which can have an (negative) effect on lifetime and power production. To predict the impact of DMs on a PV module or even a PV system, DM detection and evolution studies are needed. Several different analyses techniques are available, as each visualizes and analyzes different DMs and properties, therefore allows specific statements.  Analysis techniques  Some DMs, like snailtracks or glass breakage, are visible by the naked eye. Others, like cell cracks and current mismatches in cells, can be visualized with luminescence techniques, while hot spots can be detected with infrared thermography. This article gives an overview about common analysis techniques used for operation and maintenance (O&M;) of PV modules in the field.  Visual inspection  As it is the cheapest and fastest method, visual inspection is always first choice. It can be done during every inspection of the PV plant, but also more detailed, following a certain procedure. As visual inspection is subjective, evaluation forms are developed to ensure comparability. Possible defects, which can be identified by visual inspection, are glass breakage, electro- chemical corrosion, burn marks (in front or back sheet), delamination of front glass or back sheet, browning (evoked by atmospheric oxygen or heating), snail tracks, soiling and others.  IV curve measurement  A current-voltage curve (IV curve) of a PV module gives information about the relation between current and voltage of the module and therefore about its quality and the solar cell efficiency. It might be distinguished between IV curve measurements in a laboratory under standard test conditions (STC) and a measurement outside in the field. Measurements under standard test conditions (STC: 1000 W/m², 25 °C, air mass (AM) 1.5 radiation) show the specifications of a PV module and its quality and allows comparison with other modules measured under the same conditions. To assure STC, laboratory conditions and certain equipment are necessary. A solar simulator and a test bench are required: the module (or cell) is mounted in the test bench and then irradiated for a fraction of a second (so called \\"flashed\\"). During the flash, the voltage of the module is sweeped along a defined range and the resulting current is measured, resulting in the IV curve. Usually accuracies of about 3 % can be expected for laboratory IV measurements. IV curve of a PV module and the effects provoked by series and shunt resistances and cell mismatches For IV curve collection in the field one have to notice that irradiance and temperature are not controllable. Thus, to compare the resulting IV curve to ones taken in different conditions, it needs to be adapted to STC by correction factors for measured irradiance and cell temperature. A calibrated solar device can be used to measure the present sunlight irradiance and a temperature sensor (like a Pt100) to measure the cell temperature of the module under investigation. To measure the IV curve of a single module, portable devices, so called IV curve tracers, are available. Modern inverter or maximum power point tracker (MPPT) are able to measure the IV curve of the connected string (series circuit of multiple PV modules). In a PV module under operation, the extreme conditions are open-circuit and short-circuit. At open-circuit, the voltage is maximum (open-circuit voltage VOC) and the current zero. Whereas at short-circuit the current is maximum (short-circuit current, ISC) and the voltage zero. The power is given by the product of current and voltage and has a maximum at maximum power point (MPP). One parameter to define the quality of a PV module is the fill factor (FF), which is the ratio between maximum power (PMPP) of the module and the virtual power (PT, product of VOC and ISC). All these values can be extracted from a measured IV curve. Furthermore, the IV curve allows to determine the shunt resistance (RSH) and series resistance (RS) of a PV module. The series resistance is the combined resistance of all materials and their transitions, created current has to overcome, to reach the load. An increased RS results in less slope of the IV curve close to VOC. The shunt resistance instead describes the separation strength of the pn-junction in the solar cell. A decrease in shunt resistance results in an increased slope of the IV curve close to ISC. Electrical mismatches between the cells of a module result in a step wise behaviour of the IV curve. The same characteristic can occur from partially shading, which itself creates a mismatch.  Infrared thermography  Thermography image of a PV module with hot spots in centered cell. Some DMs lead to potential differences between the cells of a module or just parts of a single cell, which usually result in increased temperature, so called hot spots. An infrared (IR) camera allows to take an image of the module temperature with high spatial resolution, this is called thermography. Three different measurement methods are possible with thermography. The first one is called steady state thermography and can be done in the field. In laboratory conditions it is possible to perform pulse thermography and lock-in thermography, which can give a more detailed view of the PV module. Steady state thermography is performed while the PV module is in normal operation and working under steady state conditions. It can be done on module level, as overview images of multiple modules or even on huge PV plant sections with unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). A cloudless day, irradiance of minimum 700 W/m², low ambient temperatures and low wind speed are preferred measuring conditions. As the infrared irradiance decreases with the distance, the image should be taken at an angle between min. 60° and best at 90° to module plane. Simultaneously any shadow on the module must be prevented (e.g. cast by clouds, buildings, operator or camera). Due to convective heat transfer variations of 3-5 K in a module are normal. Hot spots instead, are large local temperature differences of multiple 10 K. A hot spot can affect just a part of a cell in broken cells, affect whole cells for mismatches or even multiple cells, usually close to the module frame in case of potential-induced degradation (PID).  UV fluorescence  Ultraviolet fluorescence (UVF) is a common principle in different research fields. Exposing a material to ultraviolet (UV) light excites electrons of luminophores (more specific: fluorophores) in the material into higher energy states and emits photons with material-specific wavelengths by radiative recombination. These Photons can be seen by the naked eye, can be imaged with a camera or analysed with an UV/VIS spectrometer. To distinguish between excitation source and emitted signal, a bandwidth limited source (Light-emitting diode in UV regime) and a longpass filter can be used. Luminophores are originally not present in a PV module. Due to long exposure to UV light during operation (after 80 kWh/m², equivalent to about one year in operation), they are created as decomposition products of molecules in the encapsulation of the module (usually Ethylene-vinyl acetate, EVA). Thus, UVF is useful to analyze the status of the EVA in a PV module, but only after a certain time. DMs in other materials of the module (glass, cells, back sheet) are not directly visible by UV fluorescence, but they can result in changes of the EVA which become visible. If Oxygen is part in the decomposition process, oxidization takes place and non fluorescent decomposition products are built. Oxygen can enter through the back sheet into the module and into the encapsulation. But only between cells and at cell cracks it is able to permeate through the slits into the front encapsulation where its reaction becomes visible. Thus, frames around the cells and tracks along cell cracks are visible in the UVF image through missing fluorescence signal. While UVF imaging with a camera gives statements about the luminescence intensity and thus the fluorophore density, UVF spectroscopy analyses the kind of present fluorophores by measuring the emitted spectrum at a precise spot of the module. Therefore, it allows statements for example about the cell temperature history, as higher temperatures result in additional peaks in the measured spectrum. The measured UVF signal can be influenced by many reasons: e.g. the position on the module, the time a module is in operation, the actual temperature as well as the temperature history of the module, the experienced doses of heat, humidity and UV light and other.  Luminescence  In luminescence imagery, carriers inside the diode of the PV-module solar-cells are excited and luminescence radiation is emitted due to radiative recombination. The wavelength of the emitted photons is determined by the band gap energy of the cell material, which are photons in the short- wave infrared (SWIR) regime at 1140 nm for Silicon. As the luminescence signal is created by the solar cell material, it gives an insight to the cell material status and therefore allows the detection of DMs like cell cracks, PID, and statements about material properties like series resistance. The signal can be collected with a camera, whose sensor is sensitive in the SWIR regime. For excitation of the solar cells, two different approaches are commonly used: Electroluminescence and Photoluminescence. = Electroluminescence = For electroluminescence (EL) imaging, excitation of the Silicon is triggered by an external forward current, applied to the module connectors by a power supply. The emerging forward bias forces majority carrier to cross the pn-junction, resulting in increased recombination. This method corresponds to the working principle of light emitting diodes (LEDs). Usually, EL is done in laboratory conditions, where a dark environment ensures separation of emitted and surrounding radiation. But also outdoor EL under low light conditions is practicable. To get rid of any noise (in laboratory noise due to electronics and statistical fluctuations of the emitted photons, outdoor additionally the ambient radiation) in the collected signal, background subtraction of the EL image is done. Therefore, an identical image with power supply off is taken, which consists only of the noise and can be subtracted from the initial image. EL imagery allows detection of many DMs like cell cracks, cell mismatches, finger disruptions, PID and others. = Photoluminescence = Photoluminescence (PL) imaging is done by use of an external light source to excite carrier inside the Silicon of the solar cells. If no circuit is applied or the load on the module is high enough, the excited carrier have no way to leave the solar cell and will recombine, resulting in luminescence radiation. The light source should have a narrow spectrum, like a LED or a homogenized diode laser, to allow easy separation of its own light to the luminescence signal. Additionally, separation can be assured by an long- pass or even a band-pass filter. In laboratory conditions the same rules like for EL apply and background subtraction should be performed. A new approach uses the daylight as exciting source (outdoor daylight photoluminescence), which results in even less necessary equipment. The advantage of PL over EL is, that no electrical connection to the module is necessary. Therefore, PL can be performed during the whole production cycle of solar cells (EL only if connectors are mounted) and PV modules in operation can stay connected to the grid, whereas for EL they have to be disconnected and the external power supply attached. additionally to the DMs detectable with EL, PL can measure the minority carrier lifetime in the cell material, the diffusion length and the diode voltage.

Introduced by Donald G. Anderson, this technique can be used to find the solution to fixed point equations f(x) = x often arising in the field of computational science.  Definition  Given a function f:\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^n, consider the problem of finding a fixed point of f, which is a solution to the equation f(x) = x. A classical approach to the problem is to employ a fixed-point iteration scheme; that is, given an initial guess x_0 for the solution, to compute the sequence x_{i+1} = f(x_i) until some convergence criterion is met. However, the convergence of such a scheme is not guaranteed in general; moreover, the rate of convergence is usually linear, which can become too slow if the evaluation of the function f is computationally expensive. Anderson acceleration is a method to accelerate the convergence of the fixed-point sequence. Define g(x) = f(x) - x, and denote g_k = g(x_k) (where x_k is the sequence of iterates from the previous paragraph). Given an initial guess x_0 and an integer parameter m \\\\geq 1, the method can be formulated as follows: :x_1 = f(x_0) :\\\\forall k = 1, 2, \\\\dots ::m_k = \\\\min{m, k} ::G_k = \\\\begin{bmatrix} g_{k-m_k} & \\\\dots & g_k \\\\end{bmatrix} ::\\\\alpha_k = \\\\operatorname{argmin}_{\\\\alpha\\\\in A_k} \\\\G_k \\\\alpha\\\\_2, \\\\quad \\\\text{where}\\\\;A_k = {\\\\alpha = (\\\\alpha_0, \\\\dots, \\\\alpha_{m_k}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m_k+1} : \\\\sum_{i=0}^{m_k}\\\\alpha_i = 1} ::x_{k+1} = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{m_k}(\\\\alpha_k)_i f(x_{k-m_k+i}) Conventional stopping criteria can be used to end the iterations of the method. For example, iterations can be stopped when \\\\x_{k+1} - x_k\\\\ falls under a prescribed tolerance, or when the residual g(x_k) falls under a prescribed tolerance. With respect to the standard fixed-point iteration, the method has been found to converge faster and be more robust, and in some cases avoid the divergence of the fixed-point sequence.  Solution of the minimization problem  At each iteration of the algorithm, the constrained optimization problem \\\\operatorname{argmin}\\\\G_k \\\\alpha\\\\_2, subject to \\\\alpha\\\\in A_k needs to be solved. The problem can be recast in several equivalent formulations, yielding different solution methods which may result in a more convenient implementation: * defining the matrices \\\\mathcal{G}_k = \\\\begin{bmatrix} g_{k-m_k+1} - g_{k-m_k} & \\\\dots & g_{k} - g_{k-1}\\\\end{bmatrix} and \\\\mathcal{X}_k = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{k-m_k+1} - x_{k-m_k} & \\\\dots & x_{k} - x_{k-1} \\\\end{bmatrix}, solve \\\\gamma_k = \\\\operatorname{argmin}_{\\\\gamma\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m_k}}\\\\g_k - \\\\mathcal{G}_k\\\\gamma\\\\_2, and set x_{k+1} = x_k + g_k - (\\\\mathcal{X}_k + \\\\mathcal{G}_k)\\\\gamma_k; * solve \\\\theta_k = {(\\\\theta_k)_i}_{i = 1}^{m_k} = \\\\operatorname{argmin}_{\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m_k}}\\\\left\\\\g_k + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m_k}\\\\theta_i(g_{k-i} - g_k)\\\\right\\\\_2, then set x_{k+1} = x_k + g_k + \\\\sum_{j = 1}^{m_k}(\\\\theta_k)_j(x_{k-j} - x_k + g_{k-j} - g_k). For both choices, the optimization problem is in the form of an unconstrained linear least-squares problem, which can be solved by standard methods including QR decomposition and singular value decomposition, possibly including regularization techniques to deal with rank deficiencies and conditioning issues in the optimization problem. Solving the least-squares problem by solving the normal equations is generally not advisable due to potential numerical instabilities and generally high computational cost. Stagnation in the method (i.e. subsequent iterations with the same value, x_{k+1} = x_k) causes the method to break down, due to the singularity of the least-squares problem. Similarly, near-stagnation (x_{k+1}\\\\approx x_k) results in bad conditioning of the least squares problem. Moreover, the choice of the parameter m might be relevant in determining the conditioning of the least- squares problem, as discussed below.  Relaxation  The algorithm can be modified introducing a variable relaxation parameter (or mixing parameter) \\\\beta_k > 0. At each step, compute the new iterate as x_{k+1} = (1 - \\\\beta_k)\\\\sum_{i=0}^{m_k}(\\\\alpha_k)_i x_{k-m_k+i} + \\\\beta_k \\\\sum_{i=0}^{m_k}(\\\\alpha_k)_i f(x_{k-m_k+i})\\\\;.The choice of \\\\beta_k is crucial to the convergence properties of the method; in principle, \\\\beta_k might vary at each iteration, although it is often chosen to be constant.  Choice of m  The parameter m determines how much information from previous iterations is used to compute the new iteration x_{k+1}. On the one hand, if m is chosen to be too small, too little information is used and convergence may be undesirably slow. On the other hand, if m is too large, information from old iterations may be retained for too many subsequent iterations, so that again convergence may be slow. Moreover, the choice of m affects the size of the optimization problem. A too large value of m may worsen the conditioning of the least squares problem and the cost of its solution. In general, the particular problem to be solved determine the best choice of the m parameter.  Choice of m_k  With respect to the algorithm described above, the choice of m_k at each iteration can be modified. One possibility is to choose m_k = k for each iteration k (sometimes referred to as Anderson acceleration without truncation). This way, every new iteration x_{k+1} is computed using all the previously computed iterations. A more sophisticated technique is based on choosing m_k so as to maintain an small enough conditioning for the least-squares problem.  Relations to other classes of methods  Newton's method can be applied to the solution of f(x) - x = 0 to compute a fixed point of f(x) with quadratic convergence. However, such method requires the evaluation of the exact derivative of f(x), which can be very costly. Approximating the derivative by means of finite differences is a possible alternative, but it requires multiple evaluations of f(x) at each iteration, which again can become very costly. Anderson acceleration requires only one evaluation of the function f(x) per iteration, and no evaluation of its derivative. On the other hand, the convergence of an Anderson-accelerated fixed point sequence is still linear in general. Several authors have pointed out similarities between the Anderson acceleration scheme and other methods for the solution of non-linear equations. In particular: * Eyert and Fang and Saad interpreted the algorithm within the class of quasi-Newton and multisecant methods, that generalize the well known secant method, for the solution of the non-linear equation g(x) = 0; they also showed how the scheme can be seen as a method in the Broyden class; * Walker and Ni showed that the Anderson acceleration scheme is equivalent to the GMRES method in the case of linear problems (i.e. the problem of finding a solution to A\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{x} for some square matrix A), and can thus be seen as a generalization of GMRES to the non-linear case; a similar result was found by Washio and Oosterlee. Moreover, several equivalent or nearly equivalent methods have been independently developed by other authors, although most often in the context of some specific application of interest rather than as a general method for fixed point equations.  Example MATLAB implementation  The following is an example implementation in MATLAB language of the Anderson acceleration scheme for finding the fixed-point of the function f(x) = \\\\sin(x) + \\\\arctan(x).

It is entirely open-source and provides a wide range of algorithms employed in image registration problems. Its components are designed to be modular to ease a fast and reliable creation of various registration pipelines tailored for case-specific applications. It was first developed by Stefan Klein and Marius Staring under the supervision of Josien P.W. Pluim at Image Sciences Institute (ISI). Its first version was command- line based, allowing the final user to employ scripts to automatically process big data-sets and deploy multiple registration pipelines with few lines of code. Nowadays, to further widen its audience, a version called SimpleElastix is also available, developed by Kasper Marstal, which allows the integration of elastix with high level languages, such as Python, Java, and R.  Image registration fundamentals  High level representation of a generic image registration pipeline Image registration is a well-known technique in digital image processing that searches for the geometric transformation that, applied to a moving image, obtains a one-to-one map with a target image. Generally, the images acquired from different sensors (multimodal), time instants (multitemporal), and points of view (multiview) should be correctly aligned to proceed with further processing and feature extraction. Even though there are a plethora of different approaches to image registration, the majority is composed of the same macro building blocks, namely the transformation, the interpolator, the metric, and the optimizer. Registering two or more images can be framed as an optimization problem that requires multiple iterations to converge to the best solution. Starting from an initial transformation computed from the image moments the optimization process searches for the best transformation parameters based on the value of the selected similarity metric. The figure on the right shows the high-level representation of the registration of two images, where the reference remains constant during the entire process, while the moving one will be transformed according to the transformation parameters. In other words, the registration ends when the similarity metric, which is a mathematical function with a certain number of parameters to be optimized, reaches the optimal value which is highly dependent on the specific application.  Main building blocks  Following the structure of the image registration workflow, the elastix toolbox proposes a modular solution that implements for each of the building blocks different algorithms, highly employed in medical image registration, and helps the final users to build their specific pipeline by selecting the most suitable algorithm for each of the main building blocks. Each block is easily configurable both by selecting pre-defined initialization values or by trying multiple sets of parameters and then choosing the most performing one. The registration is performed on images, and the elastix toolbox supports all the data formats supported by ITK, ranging from JPEG and PNG to medical standard formats such as DICOM and NIFTI. It also stores physical pixel spacing, the origin and the relative position to an external world reference system, when provided in the metadata, to facilitate the registration process, especially in medical field applications.  Transformation  The transformation is an essential building block, since it defines the allowable transformations. In image registration, the main distinction can be done between parallel-to- parallel and parallel-to-non parallel (deformable) line mapping transformations. In the elastix toolbox, the final users can select one transformation or compose more transformations either through addition or via composition. Below are reported the different transformation models in order of increasing flexibility, along with the corresponding elastix class names between brackets. *Translation (TranslationTransform) allows only translations *Rigid (EulerTransform) expands the translation adding rotations and the object is seen as a rigid body *Similarity (SimilarityTransform) expands the rigid transformation by introducing isotropic scaling *Affine (AffineTransform) expands the rigid transformation allowing both scaling and shear *B-splines (BSplineTransform) is a deformable transformation usually preceded by a rigid or affine one *Thin-plate splines (SplineKernelTransform) is a deformable transformation belonging to the class of kernel-based transformations that is a composition of and affine and a non-rigid part  Metric  The similarity metric is the mathematical function whose parameters should be optimized to reach the desired registration, and, during the process, it is computed multiple times. Below are reported the available metrics computed employing the reference and the transformed images and the corresponding elastix class names between brackets. *Mean squared difference (AdvancedMeanSquares) to be used for mono-modal applications *Normalized correlation coefficient (AdvancedNormalizedCorrelation) to be used for images that have an intensity linear relationship *Mutual information (AdvancedMattesMutualInforma) to be used for both mono- and multi-modal applications and optimized to reach better performance compared to the normalized version *Normalized mutual information (NormalizedMutualInforma) for both mono- and multi-modal applications *Kappa statistic (AdvancedKappaStatistic) to be used only for binary images  Sampler  For the computation of the similarity metrics, it is not always necessary to consider all the voxels and, sometimes, it can be useful to use only a fraction of the voxels of the images, i.e. to reduce the execution time for big input images. Below are reported the available criteria for selecting a fraction of the voxels for the similarity metric computation and the corresponding elastix class names between brackets. *Full (Full) to employ all the voxels *Grid (Grid) to employ a regular grid defined by the user to downsample the image *Random (Random) to randomly select a percentage of voxels defined by the users (all voxels have equal probability to be selected) *Random coordinate (RandomCoordinate) like the random criterion, but in this case also off-grid positions can be selected to simplify the optimization process  Interpolator  After the application of the transformation, it may occur that the voxels used for the similarity metric computation are at non-voxel positions, so intensity interpolation should be performed to ensure the correctness of the computed values. Below are reported the implemented interpolators and the corresponding elastix class names between brackets. *Nearest neighbor (NearestNeighborInterpolator) exploits little resources, but gives low quality results *Linear (LinearInterpolator) is sufficient in general applications *N-th order B-spline (BSplineInterpolator) can be used to increase the order N, increasing quality and computation time. N=0 and N=1 indicate the nearest neighbor and linear cases respectively.  Optimizer  The optimizer defines the strategy employed for searching the best transformation parameter to reach the correct registration, and it is commonly an iterative strategy. Below are reported some of the implemented optimization strategies. *Gradient descent *Robbins-Monro, similar to the gradient descent, but employing an approximation of the cost function derivatives A wider range of optimizers is also available, such as Quasi-Newton or evolutionary strategies.  Other features  The elastix software also offers other features that can be employed to speed up the registration procedure and to provide more advanced algorithms to the end-users. Some examples are the introduction of blur and Gaussian pyramid to reduce data complexity, and multi-image and multi-metric framework to deal with more complex applications.  Applications  Elastix has applications mainly in the medical field, where image registration is fundamental to get comprehensive information regarding the analysed anatomical region. It is widely employed in image-guided surgery, tumour monitoring, and treatment assessment. For example, in radiotherapy planning, image registration allows to correctly deliver the treatment and evaluate the obtained results. Thanks to the wide range of implemented algorithms, the use of the elastix software allows physicians and researchers to test different registration pipelines from the simplest to more complex ones, and to save the best one as a configuration file. This file and the fact that the software is completely open-source makes it easy to reproduce the work, that can help supporting the open science paradigm, and allows fast reuse on different patients data. In image-guided surgery, registration time and accuracy are critical points, considering that, during the registration, the patient is on the operating table, and the images to be registered have lower resolution compared to the target ones. In this field, the possibility to exploit elastix with high-level languages, such as OpenCL, opens to research in the usage of GPUs and other hardware accelerators.

The composition of the different inks (carbon, silver, gold, platinum) used in the manufacture of the electrode determines its selectivity and sensitivity. This fact allows the analyst to design the most optimal device according to its purpose. The evolution of these electrochemical cells arises from the need to reduce the size of the devices, that implies a decrease of the sample volume required in each experiment. In addition, the development of SPEs has enable the reduction of the production costs. One of the principal advantages is the possibility of modifying the screen-printed electrodes, modifying the composition of its inks by adding different metals, enzymes, complexing agents, polymers, etc., which is useful for the preparation of multitude electrochemical analyses.  Description  Screen printing is one of the oldest methods of reproduction. The screen- printed electrodes (SPEs) are presented as a single device in which there are three different electrodes: * Working electrode. Their response is sensitive to the analyte concentration. * Reference electrode. It allows the application of a known potential, which is independent of the analyte and other ions concentration. Its potential is constant, and the working electrode potential is measured against it. * Auxiliary or counter electrode. It is the electrode that completes the circuit of the three-electrode cell, as it allows the passage of current. It enables the analysis of processes in which electronic transfer takes place. Screen-printed electrode with the three electrode system, reference electrode (RE), working electrode (WE) and auxiliary or counter electrode (AE or CE) The three electrodes could be printed on different types of substrates (plastic or ceramic) and could be manufactured with a great variety of inks. The most common inks are those composed of silver and carbon, however, they can be based on other metals such as platinum, gold, palladium or copper. In addition, the electrodes can be modified with enzymes, metallic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, polymers or complexing agents. The electrode ink composition is chosen according to the final application and the selectivity and sensitivity required for the analysis.2,5,6 The electrode manufacturing process involves the sequential deposition of different layers of conductive and/or insulating inks on the substrates of interest. The process consists of several stages: * Film deposition usually on plastic or ceramic. * Drying of the printed films, thus eliminating possible organic solvents needed to produce a proper adhesion. Drying can be done in an oven at temperatures between 300 and 1200 °C, or in cold cured ink with a subsequent UV light photocuring process. * The process can be repeated if complex structures are required using the appropriate material for the specific design. On the other hand, as mentioned above, the most commonly used inks are silver and carbon, therefore, their printing and manufacturing characteristics should be highlighted: * Silver ink. This ink acts as a conductor, while the working electrodes are printed mainly with graphite inks, although gold, platinum and silver inks are also used. Some ink components induce differences in detection and analysis. * Carbon ink. The electrodes composition is usually confidential information from the manufacturing company, however, there are key elements for the electrodes composition such as binders, used to improve the affinity of the substrate and ink, and solvents employed to improve the viscosity for the printing process. The type, size or charge of the graphite particles and the printing and drying conditions could affect the electron transfer and the analytical yield of the carbon sensors. * Gold ink. Gold ink is currently generating more interest due to the formation of self-assembling monolayers (SAM) by means of strong Au-S bonds. Gold ink has less use due to Screen printed electrodes with gold, carbon and silver ink respectively  Advantages and applications  Screen-printed electrodes offer several advantages such as low cost, flexibility of their design, great reproducibility of the process and of the electrodes obtained, the possibility of manufacturing them with different materials and the wide capacity of modification of the work surface. Another advantage is the possibility of connection to a portable instrumentation allowing the in-situ determination of specific analytes. In addition, screen-printed electrodes avoid tedious cleaning processes. Currently, they are used as a support to produce portable electrochemical biosensors for environmental analysis. Some applications are: * Phenolic compounds: their quick detection from electrochemical biosensors based on SPE is a challenge because they easily penetrate plants, animals and humans through their membranes and skins, producing toxic side effects. * Nitrite and phosphate: their detection at low levels is of great importance due to their toxicity. SPEs capable of detecting nitrite and phosphate have been designed. Micro-electrodes combined with screen-printing technology have been used to manufacture nitrite-sensitive sensors. * Pesticides: Organophosphate pesticides are harmful to humans and animals because they inhibit the activity of many enzymes. Nowadays, inhibition biosensors based on SPEs have emerged. * Herbicides: Drinking water is contaminated due to the increased use of herbicides. To achieve selective detection, the most common method is the immunoassay which, combined with SPEs, is detected directly avoiding the cleaning and reuse of active components. * Heavy metal detection: simple and economic devices are needed for in-situ detection of heavy metals, due to their high toxicity even at low concentrations. The most common toxic metal ions are Pb (II) and Hg (II) # Pb (II): Sensors for lead detection are usually modified with certain materials (carbon, bismuth or gold among others) to increase their sensitivity. To improve their detection, these modifiers are attached to the SPEs surface. The most widely used is bismuth due to its great yield and improved sensitivity, reaching the level of parts per billion (ppb). # Hg (II): mercury is the most problematic pollutant. Generally, gold electrodes are used for detection due to their high affinity. However, the use of gold electrodes produces structural changes on the surface caused to the formation of amalgam. Commercially available screen-printed gold electrodes make mercury measurements in water easier because no electrode preparation is required. * Generation of SERS substrates. During the last years SPE have been used to generate in-situ SERS substrates for analytical purposes. On the other hand, a correct manufacturing process is important to avoid low reproducibilities, to encourage mineral binders or insulating polymers that achieve a high resistance of SPE, and to use inks that do not significantly affect the kinetics of the reactions that take place. In manufacturing, surface treatments are used to remove organic contaminants from the ink. This improves their electrochemical properties by increasing the surface roughness.

He attained the rank of a royal building inspector and with his cousin Major Meno Burg they were the only men in the Prussian civil service who had not renounced their Jewish faith.

Education and qualification  At the age of 18 he studied architecture and drawing from 1790 to 1792 at the Royal Academy of Arts in Berlin. On December 9, 1792 he was sworn in as pupil at the Oberhofbauamt in Berlin. His teacher and superior in service was the Royal Oberhofbaurat and Geheime Kriegsrat Friedrich Becherer. At this time ruled Frederick William II. On July 1, 1794, Sachs obtained a patent as Ober- Hof-Bau-Conducteur and on September 26, 1799, he was appointed Ober-Hof-Bau- Inspector at the Oberhofbauamt. During his training, Dr. Johann Albert Eytelwein was also one of his teachers, to whom he dedicated his work Complete instruction in the manufacture of building hardware in 1827. As building inspector he took over the leadership of the building police in his department and the chairmanship of the examination commission of the master builders. Between 1790 and 1796, it was planned to use the land in the Molkenmarkt 1 area for the construction of the new city bailiwick. Projects were designed by members of the Oberhofbauamt and construction began in 1791 under the direction of Paul Ludwig Simon and Friedrich Gilly. Solomo Sachs had, not officially requested, designed two facades for this. These were the facades of the portal and the front on the Spree side, which the authority accepted very favourably, and for which he received his first public recognition. Since 1786 the Academy of Arts and Mechanical Science published the catalogue for the annual Academy exhibition. In the following years the biennial rhythm was introduced. The aim was to distinguish the Berlin public from the other academies in Kassel and Dresden. In the years 1786 to 1816, mainly architectural models and designs based on antique models took up space. A large proportion of the entries were submitted by academy students and younger Conducteuren. In 1794, Johann Carl Gottlieb Schlaetzer, Salomo Sachs, August Ferdinand Mandel (1771–1846), Johann Georg Moser and Paul Ludwig Simon were able to contribute their designs for churches, prisons, a playhouse, hunting lodge, country houses and town houses, summer houses and mortuaries to the exhibition and catalogue. In 1798 Sachs designed a mortuary for the Society of Friends (Gesellschaft der Freunde), but for financial reasons it was never executed. From 1799 to 1806 he taught as a drawing teacher for architecture and a teacher for machine drawings at the Bauakademie, which was newly founded by King Frederick William III. on 6 July 1799.Karl Friedrich Schinkel, ein Sohn der Spätaufklärung von Mario Zadow. p. 189 (books.google.de).Vollständiger Unterricht in der Anfertigung der Bau- Anschläge 1827 Salomo Sachs. p. 3 (Cover).Rudolf Vierhaus (ed.):Poethen – Schlüter. p. 663 (books.google.de).Mein fünfzigjähriges Dienstleben und literarisches Wirken – Ich büße für meinen Glauben – Jüdische Memoiren.

Here, the older and higher-ranking officials of the Collegium were in demand, for example Johann Heinrich Gentz. As a young civil servant, Solomo Sachs was so fascinated by this task that he worked out his own drawings, ideas and drafts in complete silence. He submitted them to his teacher, the privy councillor Becherer, who submitted the drawings for examination. Against all the specialists' magnificent drawings, his designs for the Palace Bridge and the New Guardhouse won the prize. The outbreak of war delayed the plans. 150214 Neue Wache Berlin.jpgView of the Neue Wache from the street Unter den Linden.

He received waiting pay from the government from 1808 to 1816. Only after the end of the war was the plan resumed by Friedrich Schinkel, but now it was implemented with its adaptations. It was not until 1842 that Sachs noted in his autobiography that the new guardhous in particular resembled his basic designs, with the exception of Schinkel's masterly decoration of the buildingGeschichte der Juden in Berlin I.

The flying cataster and the municipal tax  In 1812, Sachs wrote the first complete Allgemeine Straßen und Wohnungs- Anzeiger for the royal capital of Berlin. It was a groundbreaking work for future address books as well, and this masterpiece even found buyers abroad. The king ordered 4 copies and the State Chancellor Karl August Prince von Hardenberg ordered 12 copies. The police stations also ordered, as the map plans and addresses were very accurate. Unfortunately the beginning of the second French war prevented him from making a good financial living. However, the address book opened up another possibility, since the Privy Councillor Friedrich August von Staegemann, chairman of the finance party, was currently working on the organisation of the property tax, the idea of a flying cataster was born. Sachs opened an office to deal with this task, in order to gain control of the taxpayers with the least personnel. Berlin was thereby divided into 12 tax districts, with each district receiving information on changes in the residence of its citizens every day by means of a form and updated hourly. This is also how the first residents' registration offices came into being and police-relevant parts of the flying cadastre were set up and used at every police station in Berlin's residential city. The Privy Oberfinanzrat von Staegemann commissioned Sachs to make proposals to provide the state with income of several million talers through a suitable tax. His proposal led to the municipal tax that is still in force today and was first implemented as a Mieth tax. Die nationale Erhebung 1813 (1870, Anton von Werner)  The Accommodation authority  In 1813 the accommodation authority had to be reorganized, as Russian troops passing through had to be accommodated and fed by tenants and house owners. This represented an unbearable burden of war and many complaints were made about the state's ruthless distribution practices. On 15 March 1813, at the highest cabinet order of King Friedrich Wilhelm III, who was in Breslau, Silesia at the time, the entire Prussian territory between the Elbe and the Russian border was divided into four military governorates (1813–1815) for military strategic reasons of waging war against France. At the same time, the Oberregierungskommission in Berlin, which had been founded on January 20, 1813, was dissolved, as was the General Commission for Accommodation, Food and marching affairs (german General Kommission für das Einquartierung, Verpflegung und Marschwesen), which had been created on April 24, 1812. The royal order to Berlin to establish the 1st Military Governorate between the Elbe and Oder rivers was given to Military Governor Lieutenant General Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq and Civil Governor and Privy State Councillor Dr. Johann August Sack. They were to find suitable measures and solutions for the troops passing through and their quartering. This important authority entrusted Sachs with this task. He was assigned staff and assigned a room in the Kölln town hall, which he set up as an account office. There he and his colleagues were the contact persons for inquiries, complaints, claims and the development of a fair system of accommodation for the citizens. In March 1813, the orders of magnitude to be handled amounted to 13300 soldiers and 4000 horses of the Russian military and 8100 soldiers and 1000 horses of the Prussian army every day. In July the maximum number of Prussian soldiers, 2000 prisoners and 5500 sick people reached 18000. Solomon had found the ingenious solution with a voucher system (paper money) that would be paid out at the end of the war. Everyone who reported within 24 hours of being billeted and handed in his billet for the quarter received these vouchers. This fair system could thus be installed, and Sachs and his many employees solved this task to everyone's satisfaction.Schinkel – Künstler/Preuße/Brandenburger Schinkelsche Entwürfe – Neue Wache pp. 49–50.

On April 7, 1816, Sachs asked the king for his reinstatement. This request was rejected on the basis of Prussian Jewish Edict §9 of 1812. However, his second petition, dated April 24, 1816, led to success through the king, who allowed the exception to the rule, and through the announcement of the supreme cabinet order of April 29, 1816, by Cabinet Counsel Albrecht. At this time, Sachs lived at 49 Markgrafenstrasse and was a neighbor of Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy.L.

Alte Synagoge Berlin, Heidereutergasse.jpgOld synagogue, etching of Friedrich August Calau Alte Synagoge Berlin, Heidereutergasse - Inneres.jpgThe interior  His transfer to Marienwerder in West Prussia  From 1816 to 1820 he worked as Country master builder for the Royal Government Marienwerder in West Prussia. From the laying of the foundation stone on May 3, 1818 until its ceremonial consecration on August 3, 1823, a Protestant church was built in Mewe according to plans by Schinkel, under the construction supervision of Sachs. In other church buildings in Stuhm and Marienwerder he was discriminated against by Protestant clergy anti-Semitic, which is why he built here as a Jew. He implemented Schinkel's designs despite all adversities. There were great difficulties in doing so, because the construction drawings of Schinkel were partly not understood or misinterpreted by Sachs' superior, the government and building official Balkow (1816–1825 building official in Marienwerder). In 1819, Salomo Sachs opened a Baugewerkschule in Marienwerder, which existed for 15 years until 1834. He took over the management and offered free lessons.Preußische Provinzial-Blätter.

From December 8, 1820, Sachs was appointed to the examination commission for building craftsmen, and his area of responsibility here was the district of Spandau. At this time he lived at Spandauerstraße 49 in the center of Berlin. On December 3, 1824, a so-called art road from Prenzlauer Tor to Heinersdorf was approved, it is today's Prenzlauer Allee. Sachs had done all the preliminary work here, including surveying, design, situation plan and cost planning. He brought together the most distinguished residents, who enabled him to do the necessary work financially. This group formed a public limited company, which, with the help of the government, put the project into practice. In 1825 Sachs began planning the new construction of the Fasanenmeisterhaus in the Tiergarten in its improved loam construction. The commission was given by the royal chief hunter Friedrich Detlev Graf von Moltke. (1750–1825). According to an expert opinion, issued by Friedrich Schinkel and Johann Carl Ludwig Schmid, on his Oberbaudeputat to execute the house in classical brick construction. The animosity of the members of the Oberbaudeputation against Salomo Sachs increased further. After Sachs was crushed by the Oberbaudepartement with his plans for the new home of the pheasant hunter, he was commissioned by Wilhelm zu Sayn- Wittgenstein-Hohenstein to hand over his drawings and cost accounting, for comparison with Schinkel's designs. After the handover, his work disappeared forever, despite demands for restitution, and Sachs was not paid for his expenses until 17 years later. Despite these setbacks and insinuations, he continued to work on his reputation. In 1829 he was commissioned by the sons of Otto von Voß to Birkholz (Bernau near Berlin) to design and rebuild a new church tower. At the same time Carl Justus Heckmann for the roofing and Carl August Mencke for the gilding of the spire were also appointed to the building work. From 1829 to 1830, Sachs became increasingly disliked by the royal government and his superiors. He had been commissioned by the military, who were convinced of his cost-saving clay construction method, to build a cavalry horse stable in Charlottenburg. At the request of the military leadership, the construction was to take place very quickly and under his sole leadership without the participation of the royal government. This caused further tensions with his superiors, as the design in brick was already available.The ten building districts. In: Official Journal of the Government in Potsdam.

In June, he once again expressed his unbroken enthusiasm for his work with a design for a monument to Friedrich II. He was praised for this by his superiors. From then on, he devoted himself to his literary work, the restoration of his reputation and the validity of his improved pisé building (through expert opinions) Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz Archivdatenbank Search via the inventory overview and online finding aids of the GStA PK Einrichtung von Denkmälern I.

Part of the table decoration had the shape of the Sloping Tower of Pisa, with the inscription \\"Sachs' indestructible Pisébau\\".Among the dinner speakers and guests were community leader Joseph Lehmann, editor of the magazine for foreign literature, Dr. Löwe as organizer of the festival and Prof. Wilhelm Stier. Stier had been trained by Solomon as a student of the Bauakademie in 1816 and they had become friends. Another speaker was the writer, philosopher, bookseller and humorist Dr. Louis Weyl. (* 23 April 1817; † 9 September 1851). With his humorous lecture on the arts, especially architecture, and a table song, he delighted the society.Die 50jährige Amts- Jubel-Feier des Königlichen Regierungsinspektor Herrn S.Sachs Berlin, am 9 Dezember 1842 zur Erinnerung für die Theilnehmer des Festes Gedruckt von F. Weidle in Berlin pp. 11–12 (mit freundlicher Unterstützung von Michel Fischer Senior Library Assistant Leopold Muller Memorial Library Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford) On 22 December 1842 Sachs celebrated his seventieth birthday. Sachs' varied literary activities continued in 1844. His astronomical writings – Achsenparallelismus und Sonnensystem, i.e. parallelism of axes and the solar system, appeared in Berlin in 1850, but were not as successful. However, his two self-developed illustrative models for teaching, the \\"Diagonon\\" and the \\"Cylindrical Ellipto-Tellurium\\", are to be praised. In 1845, Solomon wrote a pamphlet On the existence of air and water pressure, which was directed against Friedrich Johann von Drieberg.

The emancipation of the Jews always remained an important concern  An article in the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums of June 26, 1847, once again demonstrates the efforts of Solomon Sachs, even at the high age of 75, that Jewish emancipation continued to be a current topic for him. Sing-Akademie – Tagungsort der Nationalversammlung 1848 A controversial statement by the Landtag commissioner Minister Ernst von Bodelschwingh the Elder, during the discussion of the Prussian Jewish Law of 1847 at a city council meeting, led to a retrospective encounter with Sachs. He drove to the hotel of the Ministry of the Interior and waited for the minister there to hand over his biography with picture and signature as a souvenir. Bodelschwingh thanked him and asked him whether he had remained true to the Jewish faith and received a pension from the state. On 25 July 1848, the constituent Prussian National Assembly met at its 32nd session in the rooms of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin. In the commission report on the motion of the members of parliament Count Eduard von Reichenbach, Dr. Stein and Dr. Elsner to change the meeting room of 26 May, Baurat Eduard Knoblauch had been commissioned to find or rebuild a suitable larger plenary hall with various building surveys. A provisional construction of a new house for the Prussian Chambers had also been suggested to the commission by the untiringly Sachs. His plan for the house referred to the part of the chestnut grove at Am Kupfergraben that adjoins Dorotheenstraße. \\"This morning, in the 83rd year, of the Köngl. building inspector Sachs gently and painlessly fell asleep..

History Guitarist Josi Ndlovu and drummer Ebba Chitambo first met in 1969 when Ndlovu spotted Chitambo playing for a local band called Springfields. Although Chitambo had never drummed before, Ndlovu was impressed by his performance, and invited him to play with him in a band called The Movers (later: The Moove). Inspired by the music of Jimi Hendrix, Chitambo decided to start a band called Wells Fargo, and invited Ndlovu to join. The lineup was completed by jazz musician Handsome Mabhiza as guitarist and Chitambo's neighbour, young bassist Never Mpofu. The band was named based on an image in a comic book, without awareness of the existence of the bank with the same name. Wells Fargo's music was initially apolitical. However, this did not last long as he authorities viewed them with suspicion: their concerts brought white and black people together, which was seen as a threat to the segregationist rule in Rhodesia. The Rhodesian Bush War also helped push the band towards a more political direction. This political direction culminated in their first hit song, initially called \\"Have Gun - Will Travel\\". Ndlovu and Chitambo have been working on the song since 1972, before the band was even founded. The song became a pro-democracy anthem for many Zimbabweans, which got them in trouble with the local authorities in various occasions. In particular, lyrics such as \\"Watch out, freedom is coming\\" resulted in the song getting banned from radio, as well as police raids at the band's shows. Because of this, they later changed the lyric to \\"Watch out, a big storm is coming\\" for the official recording, released in 1977 under a different title (\\"Watch Out\\"). The song sold about 15 thousand copies. Wells Fargo dissolved in 1989, with the members remaining involved in their own separate music projects. The band's guitarist Handsome Mabhiza died in 2013, aged 61. In 2016, a compilation of the band's 1976-1977 singles called Watch Out! was released by Now-Again Records, marking the first ever Wells Fargo album released outside of Zimbabwe, as well as their first release in the LP format. Musical style Wells Fargo played \\"heavy rock\\" or \\"Zim heavy\\", a genre of music played in Zimbabwean townships. Their music was heavily inspired by the likes of Jimi Hendrix. The band have also named Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, The Who and Ten Years After among their influences. Discography ; Compilations * Watch Out!

The company began building houses in outer London in 1896 becoming an estate developer and a builder of large expensive houses. It also became a general building contractor, later a specialist in the central London market. In the 1980s the firm made substantial commitments to property development and when the recession came in 1990, the firm was forced into liquidation. The company is notable at the contractor for Tobacco Dock, a large development that took place in London Docklands in the late 1980s. The Early Days Harry Neal was born in 1872, the youngest child of John Neill and Ann French of Ibstock in Leicestershire, where his father ran a small bricklaying business. At the age of 17 he followed his brother George to London and was apprenticed as a carpenter. When Harry completed his apprenticeship, he branched out on his own and established an office in Kilburn, London in 1896, the same year that he married. Harry started building houses, either singly or in small groups. Harry Neal was beginning to build more expensive houses and in 1907 made the significant move up market into the high-priced residential area of Northwood. He bought parcels of land on the 762-acre Eastbury estate and, over the next five years, built properties including six-bedroomed houses selling for £5,000 – around ten times the price of an average house. In 1913 Harry moved further out and purchased land at Oxhey Woods; he was building private houses there until the First World War. With the onset of war, Harry ran down his work and took employment with McAlpine as a contract manager, giving him invaluable experience of larger construction projects. After the war, Harry gradually resumed his housebuilding not only at Northwood but also nearby Pinner and Ruislip and also further away, to the east of London. In 1923 the firm incorporated as Harry Neal Ltd; the only other director was Harry’s youngest son, Godfrey. Godfrey had joined the firm the previous year at the age of 18, training as a bricklayer. The eldest son, Harold, served in the Army after the war and did not join the company until 1928 to the age of 31. The Inter-war Period During the 1920s, with financial backing from the Westminster Bank, Harry Neal Ltd. was able to operate on a larger scale, buying first the Gatehill estate in Northwood. From the late 1920s, the company was also expanding its activities by undertaking non-housing contracts in west London. Examples included shops; Westminster Bank branches; cinemas; public houses; Harrow swimming pool; the Northwood Pinner and District Hospital; and the Northwood Hills railway station. The firm gradually extended its operations into central London, including shops, offices and blocks of flats. Some of the flats were developed by the Company itself. Harry Neal had been slowly buying the freeholds of existing terraced houses in the prestigious Princes Gate. By 1936 he had acquired numbers 7 to 11 inclusive and developed an eight-story block of 28 flats. A matching block was built on the site of numbers 1 to 3 in 1939 and the scheme was finished in 1949 on numbers 4 to 5. By the mid-1930s a labour force of 500 was on the books and the firm was engaging in substantial building contracts. Around that time, Godfrey took over the building side of the business, leaving his father, already in his 60s, to concentrate on financial and property matters. Godfrey eventually succeeded his father as managing director in 1940 with Harold as Company Secretary. Mobilisation in World War II substantially reduced both the firm’s labour force and the demand for civilian work. Civil defence work started with the construction of air raid shelters for 500 people in Trafalgar Square, the first of many shelters. The Company continued with similar sized contracts, often working for large national contractors. Post-war recovery Post war, the priority was bringing staff back into the firm. Strict building controls drastically curtailed private building and the firm concentrated on council house building, often well outside London, and refurbishment work. The American embassy was one of its better-known clients. More organisational change came with the death of Harry Neal in 1951. Although he had not been active in the firm for some years, he had remained Chairman. His will directed that Godfrey became Chairman and Managing Director and he also became the largest shareholder. The 1950s saw the third generation enter the firm, Godfrey’s son Morton joined in 1955, aged 24, having studied civil engineering. Harold’s son Nigel also joined, in his case as a surveyor. Public sector work remained important in the 1950s, one of the most significant being the town centre of Stevenage New Town where the firm was a main contractor. Growth through Acquisition The 1960s changed the whole scale and scope of the Company’s operations. In 1962 Morton became managing director, although Godfrey remained as Chairman, and Nigel was appointed as a director. That year saw the first of many acquisitions with the purchase of the building firm of Charles R Price. Charles Price was established in 1902 and had a City presence for over fifty years. However, the Prices and many of the management were members of the Plymouth Brethren. Their drift towards the more extreme Exclusive Brethren limited their ability to make social contacts and even to sign contracts. This was to the benefit of Harry Neal for as well as its traditional suburban contracting, the enlarged firm was well placed to enjoy the upsurge in office building in London, Another important acquisition strengthening the firm’s London capability was Caxton Reinforced Concrete, which specialised in the design and construction of concrete and hollow tile floors; for instance it supplied all the concrete work for the extension to the Royal Opera House. Other acquisitions gave Harry Neal greeter expertise in the finishing trades important in the refurbishment market. The breadth of trades contained within the firm contrasted with most contractors who sub-contracted many of these functions and it gave the firm a particular advantage within the London market. In the 1970s, contracts continued to increase in size and complexity and included both new construction and large-scale refurbishment work for museums, hotels, hospitals, offices and public housing. The 1960s had also seen the resumption of Harry Neal’ s speculative housing, particularly blocks of luxury flats and this continued. Property Boom and Bust The 1980s saw yet another speculative property boom and Harry Neal and family members participated in this to the full. Two particular projects stand out. A site on the King’s Road was purchased in 1983 and given planning permission for 53 large town houses to be known as Charles II Plaza; work started in 1986. In that same year, Harry Neal was awarded its largest ever contract, the £34m redevelopment of Tobacco Dock in London Docklands, to create 265,000 square feet of retail and leisure space. The contract was awarded by Tobacco Dock Developments, a Company controlled by members of the Neal family. The designer was Arup and the contractor was Harry Neal Ltd. As the boom approached its peak, in 1987, Michael Neal, Morton’s only son became managing director, the fourth generation to hold that position. The history of Harry Neal Ltd. was published in 1989: little more than a year later it was in receivership. The accounts for 1998 and 1999 had shown the Company still in profit but the Company had entered the property recession with a high level of debt and that debt was accelerating sharply. In January 1991 the Company went into receivership.. Standing out from the widespread liquidity problems were King Charles II Plaza where only three units had been sold and the Tobacco Dock. At the Dock, large amounts for work done were due from the family’s development company and Harry Neal had also made advances to Tobacco Dock Developments.Reports of the Official Receiver filed at Companies House; Company number 00194482 Family members later traded as Harry Neal Holdings specialising in extensions to very large London homes. That Company went into liquidation in 2010.

Father's day service When the 1907 Monongah, West Virginia coal mining disaster occurred on December 6, 1907, killing 361 men, 250 of them fathers., Clayton suggested to her local pastor of the Williams Methodist Episcopal Church South in Fairmont, West Virginia, Reverend Robert T. Webb, that a commemoration service be held in their honor. “It was partly the explosion that set me to think how important and loved most fathers are,” Clayton said in an interview with The Fairmont Times on September 23, 1979. “All those lonely children and the heart-broken wives and mothers, made orphans and widows in a matter of a few minutes. Oh, how sad and frightening to have no father, no husband, to turn to at such a sad time.” A memorial service was held on July 5, 1908; a date which Clayton herself chose since it was the Sunday closest to her own father's birthday. Although the remembrance recognized Clayton's father and the 1,000 childrens' fathers, the event was local and did not gain national attention. Reasons for this have been cited on claims that two other large gatherings had happened around the same time: a July 4th celebration the day before, which gathered some 12,000 people to the city, and the death of a well known daughter of parishioners to the church. The combination of extreme jubilation and intense sadness may have directed attention away from the planned Father's day remembrance service. On account of this, no one felt it necessary to approach the city and request a proclamation instituting an official Father's Day. In the following years, many people attempted to officiate a national Father's Day elsewhere, but it wasn't until 1972 when Richard Nixon signed into law a bill proclaiming it a national observance. Ten years earlier on August 10, 1962, however, an attendee to the Clayton-Webb memorial service by the name of Ward Downs wrote a letter to then United States House of Representative Arch Moore stating: \\"It has recently come to my attention of a movement establishing a Father’s Day by an act of Congress to be observed the same as Mother’s Day. It was my privilege to have attended the first Father’s Day Service July 5, 1908 at the Williams Memorial M.E. Church, South, now the Central United Methodist Church, Fairmont, WV. The sermon was preached by Dr. R.T. Webb at the request of Mrs. Charles Clayton, a member of that congregation, and daughter of a Methodist minister. I recall the occasion very distinctly as the pulpit was decorated by having ripened sheaves of wheat placed about it. Many favorable comments by the individuals and the press were made concerning the service at that time. Any assistance you can give this movement will be very much appreciated by me and all the Methodists in this part of the country.” Personal life 150px Grace Golden Clayton was born in Barboursville, West Virginia to Rev. Martin Fletcher Golden and Maria L Scott Golden. She was the youngest of eight children. Clayton's father was a traveling minister, serving the Marion Circuit throughout 1878; before being appointed elder of the Methodist Episcopal Church South in the Fayette District. In 1885, Rev. Golden served as Presiding Elder in Prestonburg, Kentucky until his death in May, 1890. Clayton married Charles Little “Charley” Clayton (September 8, 1897 - October 10, 1934). They had 4 children: Carol Jennings Clayton, Robert Lewis Clayton, Joseph Edwin Clayton, Carroll Clayton. The Fairmont Times reported that a church in the area of Stafford, completed in 1896, employed an organist named Mrs. Grace Clayton. Grace Golden Clayton died on March 29, 1958 in Belleville, West Virginia at age 82. Legacy Many years later, the city of Fairmont in Marion County, West Virginia erected approaching state signs that read: \\"Welcome to Fairmont the friendly city - Home of the first Father's Day Service July 5, 1908\\"; while the State of West Virginia itself signed governor resolutions giving Clayton proper credit for having founded Father's Day. Today, a commemoration plaque hangs outside the Central United Methodist Church in Fairmont, West Virginia (former site of the Williams Methodist Episcopal Church South) that reads: \\"First Father's Day Service.\\" See also * Father's Day * Sonora Smart Dodd  References  External links  * Grace Golden Clayton Category:1875 births Category:1958 deaths ","title":"Grace Golden Clayton"},{"id":"64346306","text":"Nikhil Rathi (born 5 August 1979) is the chief executive designate of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

It was separated from the former genus Hansenula via an examination of their 18S and 26S rRNA partial base sequencings by Yamada et al. 1994.Y. Yamada, K. Maeda, K. Mikata: The phylogenetic relationships of the hat-shaped ascospore- forming, nitrate-assimilating Pichia species, formerly classified in the genus Hansenula Sydow et Sydow, based on the partial sequences of 18S and 26S ribosomal RNAs (Saccharomycetaceae): the proposal of three new genera, Ogataea, Kuraishia, and Nakazawaea. Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry 58, 1994, 1245–1257. .  Diagnosis  Like other yeasts also the species within the genus Ogataea are single-celled or built pseudohyphae of only a few elongated cells, true hyphae are not formed. They are able to reproduce via a sexual and an asexuel reproduction. The latter one happens with a cell division by multilateral budding on a narrow base with spherical to ellipsoidal budded cells. In the sexual reproduction the asci are deliquescent and may be unconjugated or show conjugation between a cell and its bud or between independent cells. Asci produce one to four, sometimes more, ascospores which are hat-shaped, allantoid or spherical with a ledge. The species are homothallic or infrequently heterothallic. Ogataea cells are able to ferment glucose or other sugars and some species assimilate nitrate. All known species are able to assimilate methanol. The predominant ubiquinone is coenzyme Q-7 and the diazonium blue B test is negative. Some species are used and cultured for microbiological en genetic research e.g. Ogataea polymorpha, Ogataea minuta or Ogataea methanolica. Ogataea minuta (Wickerham) Y. Yamada, K. Maeda & Mikata is the type species for this genus.  Species  Ogataea consists of several species and is placed within the Saccharomycetales as a sister genus to Ambrosiozyma. Following Kurtzman et al. 2011 the genus consists of 31 species but also shows, that there are several more within the taxon that are part of the polyphyletic genus Candida.Cletus P.

It is part of the collection of the State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg (inv. Zh-4141). The size of the picture is 283 × 382 cm. Mykola Ge worked on this painting from 1861 to 1863 in Florence during his artistic trip abroad. After Ge brought the painting to St. Petersburg, it was exhibited at the Academic Exhibition in 1863. The Council of the Imperial Academy of Arts praised the artist's skill in painting, and awarded him the title of professor of history painting, and the work was purchased by Emperor Alexander II for the Museum of the Academy of Arts. The painting depicts the Last Supper, described in the New Testament, the last meal of Jesus Christ with his twelve apostles, during which he predicted that one of them — Judas Iscariot -— would betray him. This plot was popular among artists in the field of Christian art — their versions of the image of the Last Supper of Jesus Christ, among others, created by Leonardo da Vinci, Salvador Dali, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Andrea del Castagno. The painting was a success, much debated, but critics differed: some approved of the innovative interpretation of the Gospel story, while others believed that the images of Christ and the apostles were too far from traditional understanding, and they were not written convincingly enough. Mykola Ge created at least two smaller author's replicas of the painting, one of which belongs to the collection of the State Tretyakov Gallery, and the other is in the Radishchev Art Museum in Saratov.

In fact, this technique is very wonderful at which ultrashort laser will be used forpump excitation of the material and the sample response will be detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector. Acquiring data depends mainly on formation of images by raster scan mode after pumping with short laser pulse at different delay times. The characterization of the output image will be done through the temporal resolution aspect. Thus, the idea is to exploit the shorter DeBroglie wavelength in respect to the photons which has great impact to increase the resolution about 1 nm. That technique is an up-to-date approach to study the dynamic of charge on material surfaces.  Time resolved in scanning electron spectroscopy Ernst Ruska was a pioneer German scholar who won the Nobel prize in 1986. He is considered a spiritual father of existence of electron microscope in 1933 with collaboration with Max Knoll. Nowadays, the electron microscopy is miscellaneous used tool due to enhancement not only the spatial resolution respect to the optical microscope but also high imaging contrast and remarkable sensitivity due to the fact that the robustness of electrons impact on the matter in comparison with photons. Proceeding from that concept, the technology of ultrafast scanning electron microscopy has been modified by assistance of Ultrashort pulse laser which allows the scientists to investigate material dynamic in short and ultra-short scale of time. There was an early attempt to initiate this technique by Larry D.Flesner in a US patent in 1990, he incorporated the scanning electron microscopy and modulated light to study semiconductor surface photovoltaic in both time and space scale. Nowadays, pump-probe microscopy has been improved after Ahmed Zewail's discovery of femtosecond time scale for chemical reaction and has awarded the Nobel Prize for his historical discovery.  Scanning electron microscopy  Illustration shows the phenomena that occur from the interaction of highly energetic electrons with matter, also depicting the pear shape interaction volume which is typically observed in this type of interactions. Scanning electron microscopy is a powerful technique to give full reliable mapping of sample surface topography and material content in very wide range metal, semiconductor even organic samples and always operates in vacuum environment. The main operation idea depends on the production of a primary beam by cathode which passes through electron column. That column contains a series of electromagnetic lenses that focus the intensity of the beam and by this process, the primary beam reaches the specimen in few nanometers size. In principle, if the thickness of the sample is within few micrometers, the primary beam will be completely attenuated by scattering with other electrons or lattices. In fact, the primary beam interaction process could be elastic or inelastic. For the first case, no loss of energy happens, this is known as a backscattered electron. On the other hand, in case of inelastic interaction process, the emitted electron from the sample from eV to 30 KeV. The excitation might be deep core hole excitation or electron hole production. The shown picture summarizes all kinds of possible interactions and their related depth to the sample. For example the x-ray generated from long depth or an Auger electron generated at the surface. So, depending on the energy emitted from the sample, specific detectors will be used in accordance with emitted energy. The final image, acquired and reconstructed by raster scan mode, it is acquired in grayscale. Due to the fact that the emission of secondary electrons is less than 50 eV which in fact has been collected due to inelastic collision from all the volume of interaction with the specimen but only ones near to the surface can be detected. Therefore, secondary electron emission considers highly sensitive to the surface due to its generation occurs from just nanometers of depth. The sample itself plays an important role in emission depending on the local work function of the sample. These factors have nominated the SEM to be much more affordable facility in micro and nano scale regimes. = Pump probe microscopy = Pump-probe techniques in physics. Pump-probe microscopy phenomenon, widely known as transient absorption microscopy, is a sort of nonlinear process starting by excitation of the material by very short pulse laser beam (pump), which induces internal transition. A probe beam follows the pump beam to trace the progress that has been done inside the material also in very short time. In reality, that response could be changed by manipulating the time delay between pump and probe and by this way the concept of Time-resolved spectroscopy will be used to trace dynamic process evolution as a function of time. Nowadays, the appreciated impact to reach high progress in that phenomenon is directly coming from the nonlinear optics. There are many ways for nonlinear process interaction, for example second-harmonic generation, Coherent anti-Stokes Raman or two-photon-excited fluorescence. The fascinating in Ultrafast scanning electron microscopy is how powerful it obtains by combining high spatial resolution of the electrons and temporal resolution of ultra-fast pump-probe microscopy. = Measurement methodology = The fundamental idea that measurement has been built to exploit the Spatial resolution of electron microscopy and temporal resolution for ultrafast optical pump probe. The setup simply consists of scanning electron microscopy machine always works in ultra- high vacuum that regarding on electron beam as a probe and ultrashort laser beam as pump. Firstly, Schottky emission gun is almost common to use as source of primary beam due to high beam brightness after passing through electromagnetic lens. Secondly, femtosecond Powerful fibre laser with repetition rates from KHZ to few of MHz splits by nonlinear process into third and fourth harmonic generation 343 nm and 257 nm, respectively. During the measurement, the tip emission is less than thermal emission limit to acquire photoemission mode. That photoemission mode improves by allow forth harmonic generation beam to interact the tip which generates more electrons. On the other hand, another third harmonic generation will be used to excite the sample itself. The time-resolved measurement will be acquired by detecting the secondary electron emission in image shape at different delay time between third and fourth harmonic beam. The final acquired intensity must be normalized by subtraction from the background. It is important to acquire the measurement at different delay time forward and reverse that a good tool for checking the stability and reproducibility. Applications The powerfulness of that technique meets the requirement for investigation of innovative materials for electronics, sustainable energy harvesting and photonics that enables us to study the charge dynamic in deep for semiconductors materials which have been stimulated by ultrashort laser beam. It has powerful accessibility to carrier recombination and trapping in condensed matter physics that allows more progress in photovoltaics fabrication.

Cover from May 1946 The Portuguese Women’s National Council was formed in 1914. Its bulletin was first known simply as the Bulletin of the Portuguese Women’s National Council but its name was changed to Alma feminina (The Feminine Soul) in 1917. It was changed again to A Mulher (The Woman) in 1946 shortly before the Council was disbanded by the right-wing Estado Novo government in 1947.The name Alma feminina had in fact been used for an earlier feminist magazine edited by Virgínia Quaresma. The Council's main means of action was the publication of the bulletin. This was distributed throughout the life of the Council for thirty-two years, between November 1914 and May 1947, in a total of 157 issues. Distributed free of charge to members, the newsletter was sent by mail. For a time, it could also be purchased from some shops in Lisbon. Being a feminist publication, aimed mainly at members, it was concerned with publicizing the association's activities and initiatives promoted by international feminist and female organizations, as well as informing readers about the situation of women and the state of feminism in other countries. In 1920, as part of a recruitment drive for the Council, copies of the bulletin were sent out to non-members considered as potential supporters. If the recipients did not return the copies they were considered to have become new members. Free issues were also sent out in 1929 and 1930, together with a membership application form, with limited success. The first editor, known as the managing director, Maria Clara Correia Alves, stressed that the main objective of the bulletin was \\"… so that the Portuguese woman can get out of apathetic indifference in which she has remained for centuries and which has contributed so much to stifle its most just aspirations and to delay its emancipation\\". In 1921, the association's members considered it \\"the only voice for Portuguese women because it is the only magazine that defends the feminist cause\\". Although the emphasis was, therefore, on feminism, it was decided to use \\"feminine\\" rather than \\"feminist\\" in the bulletin's title because the Council's leaders were aware that \\"feminist\\" was still a pejorative word. The later change of title in 1946 was considered to \\"better match the nature of the publication and the purposes that we propose\\". In 1920 editorial responsibility was taken over by the Council’s founder and president, Adelaide Cabete, who held the position from 1920 until August 1929. Cabete then went to Angola, and Elina Guimarães took over for a year, followed by Noémia Neto Ferreira. From May 1934 until the end of 1946 the director and editor was Sara Beirão. Publication was always irregular due to the financial problems of the association. At one extreme it would appear monthly in some years, at the other, half-yearly. In 1937, the bulletin was not published at all. This was likely due to the disruption to the Council caused by the death of its driving force, Adelaide Cabete and the absence of Sara Beirão in Brazil for eight months. However, there were also political divisions within the association, with some members supporting the Estado Novo. Many of its articles were dedicated to Portuguese feminists such as Adelaide Cabete, Ana de Castro Osório, and Elina Guimarães as well as those from outside Portugal, such as Avril de Sainte-Croix, Jane Addams, and Simone de Beauvoir. As well as offering a medium for the promotion and development of feminist discourse, Alma Feminina also provided an outlet for creative writing by women. Two editions included a list of female-authored works, entitled Biblioteca Feminina (1923) and Biblioteca Feminista (1925). The emphasis on creative writing would have reflected the interests of several of the Council’s members. Sara Beirão was a well-known writer, while Maria Lamas, the president from 1945-47, was a poet and writer who in 1947 organised an exhibition of books written by women, which brought together three thousand books by 1400 women authors from thirty countries.

The activists gathered under the name of Movement Towards a Christian International, which was later renamed to International Fellowship of Reconciliation. The meetings took place at the house of Kees Boeke, a Quaker missionary and pacifist. The meetings were fundamental for the development of the international peace movement in the first half of the 20th century, as they resulted in the creation of three international peace organisations between 1919 and 1921:International Fellowship of Reconciliation (IFOR), Service Civil international (SCI) and War Resisters' International (WRI).  Three Meetings = October 1919  The invitation to the first of the three meetings was isssued by Ernest and Eveline Fletcher, Kees Boeke and Henry Hodgkin for participants to attend an international peace conference to take place between 4-19 October 1919. Fifty participants attended this meeting, among them people from Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, France, Switzerland and the USA. Notable attendees included Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze, J. B. Hugenholz, Mathilda Wrede, Lilian Stevenson, Leonhard Ragaz and Pierre Cérésole.Hélène Monastier et al.: \\"Pierre Ceresole d'après sa correspondance\\", La Baconnière, Neuchâtel, 1960.Hélène Monastier: \\"Pierre Ceresole\\", Société religieuse des Amis, Paris, 1947 – Donne par erreur l'année 1918 pour la conférence de Bilthoven. Many of the participants were conscientious objectors who were detained during World War I. Cérésole was appointed as conference secretary due to his extensive language skills.  August 1920  The second Bilthoven meeting took place in July of 1920. Here, Pierre Cérésole suggested to organise international workcamps as a means to foster reconciliation by rebuilding infrastructure destroyed during World War I. The work was to be organised in a way similar to the reconstruction efforts of the Quakers in Poland and France. This suggestion was positively received by those at the meeting, notably a German man whose brother had been involved in the destruction of Northern France as a soldier and now wished to be involved in the reconstruction. The first reconstruction camp took place in November 1920 in the village of Esnes, which had been destroyed in 1916 during the Battle of Verdun. The village was chosen also in order to foster reconciliation between French and German citizens. For the project, Cérésole enlisted the help of English Quaker Hubert Parris for his experience in organizing relief work. The project eventually had to be cancelled due to resentment from local French towards the German volunteers as the scars of World War I were still fresh. Inspired by the efforts of the volunteers, Cérésole conceptualized a voluntary service as an alternative to countries' mandatory military service. This became known as Service Civil International (SCI).  March 1921  A short conference with representatives of European peace activists took place in Bilthoven from 22-25 March, 1921. Together with Helene Stöcker, they founded the \\"PACO\\" (\\"peace\\" in Esperanto) movement, which in 1923 changed its name to War Resisters International. Following the conference, the founders of \\"PACO\\" took part in the International Anti- Militarist Union (IAMV) in The Hague on 26 March.List of the archives of the War Resisters' International (WRI), 1921-1991, J.R. van der Leeuw .War Resisters' International Archives.Devi Prasad : War is a Crime against Humanity: the Story of War Resisters' International, London, WRI, 2005.WRI Gründung.  Formation of pacifist networks  Before World War I, there were some international pacifist networks such as the International Peace Bureau (since 1891) and the IAMV (since 1904). The atrocities of World War I increased anti-war sentiments and in this context, the Bilthovenen meetings brought together three complementary attitudes of the organisations in the emerging international peace movement: * the Christian pacifism of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation * the alternative to military service of the Service Civil International * conscientious objection by War Resisters International. These pacifist networks built relationships with other international movements of the time. Associated with them were the Quakers, the Esperanto movement, Montessori education as well as the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.

According to the statutes, its main aim is \\"to manage and expand the Folkwang Museum founded by Karl Ernst Osthaus together with the city of Essen and to make it permanently available for research and popular education purposes as a public collection\\". The association is based in Essen, where the Folkwang Museum has been located since October 1922. A special feature of the association compared to almost all other museum associations is that, together with the city of Essen, it is co-owner of the collections of the Folkwang Museum. The association publishes its own periodical for its members, the Folkwang newsletter. Its chairman since 2015 is Ulrich Blank.  Goals and bodies = Association purpose  The purpose and tasks of the Folkwang Museum Association are determined in its statutes as follows: \\"1. The purpose of the association is to manage, expand and public the Folkwang Museum founded by Dr. Karl Ernst Osthaus in Hagen together with the city of Essen 2. To make the collection permanently usable for the purposes of research and popular education. 2. In addition, the association has the general task of promoting the fine arts. 3. The association also has the task of maintaining and promoting the international status and character of the museum by supporting the work of the scientific staff in the field of teaching and research as well as all efforts of the museum for international cooperation in the artistic field.\\"§1, Satutes of the Folkwang Museum Association as published on its website The purpose of the association determined in point 1 has been valid since 1922 (in the wording as quoted), the task of promoting the fine arts (analogously). The deliberate internationality of the museum and its activities was enshrined in the statutes only later, in fact it had existed from the beginning – only interrupted during the National Socialist era.  Bodies  The two governing bodies of the association are the board of directors elected by the general assembly (currently 14 members, at least seven according to the articles of association) and the executive board (currently six members). This is elected by the General Assembly on the proposal of the Board of Directors. In the early days, the board of directors had eight members (at least five according to the Articles of Association), while the executive board consisted of only three people, who at that time still had to belong to the board of directors. Cooperation with the city of Essen and the heirs of Karl Osthaus as well as the supervision of the museum's operations take place in the board of trustees (Kuratorium) of the Museum Folkwang. It comprises up to 20 people, ten representatives of the city, five from the museum association and also up to five representatives from the Karl Ernst Osthaus Foundation, as well as the director of the museum ( since 2018) as advisory member. The chair of the board of trustees changes annually between the mayor of Essen and the chairman of the museum association.Website of the Folkwang Museum Association  Membership and chairpersons  The Folkwang Museum Association has around 400 members, including legal entities (mostly companies).

History  The group was founded in 1969, as a breakaway group of the National Front of Catalonia. Jaume Martínez Vendrell, the leader of the military wing of the National Front, became its commander. EPOCA trained its militants in urban warfare techniques, smuggling in weaponry from Switzerland. The group came to prominence through a number of assassinations, committed by attaching pressure-triggered bombs to the bodies of their victims, demanding ransoms, and when they weren't received, leaving the bombs to explode, killing their victims in the process. In this way, the group assassinated in 1977 the industrialist and chemical tycoon José María Bultó, and in 1978 the ex-mayor of Barcelona, Joaquín Viola, along with his wife. By 1979, the group had become inactive in comparison with many other contemporary groups. Following discussions with paramilitaries from Terra Lliure, the groups decided to merge. This led to many of the better-trained EPOCA militants joining Terra Lliure.  Trials and justice  Seven people were arrested in connection with the killings of Bultó and the Violas. Two of them were tried in 1980; one was acquitted entirely, whilst Martínez Vendrell, the other, was sentenced to a year and three months in prison, although this was not directly related to the assassinations. However, he had already served this time awaiting trial, so was immediately released. The remaining five were tried in 1982, saying at the time that they \\"learned of the assassination through the newspapers and television\\". A number of additional arrests were made towards the end of 1980 in connection with the construction of the bombs that were used in the killings.

They combine various methods in each time step, in order to acquire the advantages of different methods. The existing composite methods show satisfactory accuracy and powerful numerical dissipation, which is particularly useful for solving stiff problems and differential-algebraic equations.  Definitions  After spatial discretization, structural dynamics problems are generally described by the second-order ordinary differential equation: M\\\\ddot{u} + C\\\\dot{u} + f(u,t) = R(t). Here u, \\\\dot{u} and \\\\ddot{u} denote the displacement, velocity and acceleration vectors respectively, M is the mass matrix, C is the damping matrix, f(u,t) collects the internal force, and R(t) is the external load. At the initial time t_0, the initial displacement and velocity are supposed to be given as u_0 and \\\\dot{u}_0, respectively, and the initial acceleration can be solved as \\\\ddot{u}_0=M^{-1}(R(t_0)-C\\\\dot{u}_0-f(u_0,t_0)). For numerical analysis, the overall time domain [t_0,t_N] is divided into a series of time steps by t_1, t_2, \\\\cdots, t_k, t_{k+1}, \\\\cdots. Taking the step [t_k,t_{k+1}] (t_{k+1}-t_k=h is the step size), the main concept of composite methods is to subdivide the current step to several sub-steps [t_k,t_{k+\\\\gamma_1}], [t_{k+\\\\gamma_1},t_{k+\\\\gamma_2}], \\\\cdots, and to use different numerical methods in each sub-step. Although there are lots of available methods, see the review, the existing composite methods basically employ the combination of the trapezoidal rule and linear multistep methods. However, to acquire at least second-order accuracy and unconditional stability, the scalar parameters of each method and the division of sub-steps need to be determined carefully.  Two examples of composite method= Two-sub-step Bathe method  The Bathe method is a two-sub-step method. In the first sub-step [t_k,t_{k+\\\\gamma}] (t_{k+\\\\gamma}-t_k=\\\\gamma h, \\\\gamma\\\\in(0,1)), the trapezoidal rule is used as: u_{k+\\\\gamma}=u_{k}+\\\\frac{\\\\gamma h}{2}(\\\\dot{u}_k+\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma}) \\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma}=\\\\dot{u}_{k}+\\\\frac{\\\\gamma h}{2}(\\\\ddot{u}_k+\\\\ddot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma}) M\\\\ddot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma}+C\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma}+f(u_{k+\\\\gamma},t_{k+\\\\gamma})=R(t_{k+\\\\gamma}) In the second sub-step [t_{k+\\\\gamma},t_{k+1}] (t_{k+1}-t_{k+\\\\gamma}=(1-\\\\gamma) h), the 3-point Euler backward method is employed as \\\\dot{u}_{k+1}=\\\\frac{1-\\\\gamma}{\\\\gamma h}u_k-\\\\frac{1}{(1-\\\\gamma)\\\\gamma h}u_{k+\\\\gamma}+\\\\frac{2-\\\\gamma}{(1-\\\\gamma)h}u_{k+1} \\\\ddot{u}_{k+1}=\\\\frac{1-\\\\gamma}{\\\\gamma h}\\\\dot{u}_k-\\\\frac{1}{(1-\\\\gamma)\\\\gamma h}\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma}+\\\\frac{2-\\\\gamma}{(1-\\\\gamma)h}\\\\dot{u}_{k+1} M\\\\ddot{u}_{k+1}+C\\\\dot{u}_{k+1}+f(u_{k+1},t_{k+1})=R(t_{k+1}) For nonlinear dynamics, that is, the internal force f is a nonlinear function with respect to u, the Newton-Raphson iterations can be used to solve the nonlinear equations per step. The parameter \\\\gamma is usually set as \\\\frac{1}{2} and 2-\\\\sqrt{2} in practice. The Bathe method is second-order accurate and unconditionally stable from linear analysis. Besides, this method can provide strong numerical dissipation for high-frequency content, which is helpful to damp out the stiff components and enhance the stability for nonlinear dynamics. On this basis, to acquire prescribed degree of numerical dissipation, the \\\\rho_\\\\infty-Bathe method was developed by replacing the 3-point Euler backward method in the second sub-step with a general formula: u_{k+1}=u_k+h(q_0\\\\dot{u}_k+q_1\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma}+q_2\\\\dot{u}_{k+1}) \\\\dot{u}_{k+1}=\\\\dot{u}_k+h(q_0\\\\ddot{u}_k+q_1\\\\ddot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma}+q_2\\\\ddot{u}_{k+1}) M\\\\ddot{u}_{k+1}+C\\\\dot{u}_{k+1}+f(u_{k+1},t_{k+1})=R(t_{k+1}) The parameters are selected as recommended \\\\gamma=\\\\frac{2-\\\\sqrt{2(1+\\\\rho_\\\\infty)}}{1-\\\\rho_\\\\infty}\\\\text{ if }\\\\rho_\\\\infty\\\\in[0,1); \\\\gamma=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\text{ if } \\\\rho_\\\\infty=1 q_1=\\\\frac{\\\\rho_\\\\infty+1}{2\\\\gamma(\\\\rho_\\\\infty-1)+4},q_0=(\\\\gamma-1)q_1+\\\\frac{1}{2},q_2=-\\\\gamma q_1+\\\\frac{1}{2} With the set of parameters, the \\\\rho_\\\\infty-Bathe method can also achieve second-order accuracy and unconditional stability. Moreover, by adjusting the parameter \\\\rho_\\\\infty, this method can provide tunable degree of numerical dissipation. The method with a smaller \\\\rho_\\\\infty shows stronger numerical dissipation, but lower accuracy in the low-frequency content. When \\\\rho_\\\\infty=0, it is equivalent to the original Bathe method with \\\\gamma=2-\\\\sqrt{2}.  Three-sub-step composite method  Following the idea of the Bathe method, the three-sub-step composite methods that use the trapezoidal rule in the first two sub-steps were also discussed. They divides the current step into [t_k,t_{k+\\\\gamma_1}], [t_{k+\\\\gamma_1},t_{k+\\\\gamma_2}] and [t_{k+\\\\gamma_2},t_{k+1}], and generally, the first two sub-steps are set as equal size, that is \\\\gamma_2=2\\\\gamma_1. In the first two sub-steps, the trapezoidal rule is used, as u_{k+\\\\gamma_1}=u_{k}+\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_1 h}{2}(\\\\dot{u}_k+\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_1}) \\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_1}=\\\\dot{u}_{k}+\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_1 h}{2}(\\\\ddot{u}_k+\\\\ddot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_1}) M\\\\ddot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_1}+C\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_1}+f(u_{k+\\\\gamma_1},t_{k+\\\\gamma_1})=R(t_{k+\\\\gamma_1}) and u_{k+\\\\gamma_2}=u_{k+\\\\gamma_1}+\\\\frac{(\\\\gamma_2-\\\\gamma_1) h}{2}(\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_1}+\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_2}) \\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_2}=\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_1}+\\\\frac{(\\\\gamma_2-\\\\gamma_1) h}{2}(\\\\ddot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_1}+\\\\ddot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_2}) M\\\\ddot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_2}+C\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_2}+f(u_{k+\\\\gamma_2},t_{k+\\\\gamma_2})=R(t_{k+\\\\gamma_2}) In the last sub-step, a general formula is utilized as u_{k+1}=u_k+h(c_0\\\\dot{u}_k+c_1\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_1}+c_2\\\\dot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_2}+c_3\\\\dot{u}_{k+1}) \\\\dot{u}_{k+1}=\\\\dot{u}_k+h(c_0\\\\ddot{u}_k+c_1\\\\ddot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_1}+c_2\\\\ddot{u}_{k+\\\\gamma_2}+c_3\\\\ddot{u}_{k+1}) M\\\\ddot{u}_{k+1}+C\\\\dot{u}_{k+1}+f(u_{k+1},t_{k+1})=R(t_{k+1}) For this method, Li et al. offered two optimal set of parameters, as a=\\\\frac{1}{2}(1\\\\pm\\\\rho_\\\\infty),c_0=\\\\frac{-(a+1)\\\\gamma_1^2+4\\\\gamma_1-1}{4\\\\gamma_1},c_1=\\\\frac{1+(a-1)\\\\gamma_1}{2},c_2=\\\\frac{(1-a)\\\\gamma_1^2-2\\\\gamma_1+1}{4\\\\gamma_1},c_3=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_1}{2} Here \\\\gamma_2=2\\\\gamma_1 is assumed, and \\\\gamma_1 is the minimum value that satisfies 48(a-1)\\\\gamma_1^4-32(a-5)\\\\gamma_1^3-192\\\\gamma_1^2+96\\\\gamma_1-16\\\\geq0. The resulting two sub-families are all second-order accurate, unconditionally stable, and can provide tunable numerical dissipation by adjusting \\\\rho_\\\\infty. They become the same when \\\\rho_\\\\infty=0. When 0<\\\\rho_\\\\infty<1, the sub-family with a=\\\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\\\rho_\\\\infty) shows better amplitude and period accuracy than the \\\\rho_\\\\infty-Bathe method under the same computational costs, and the sub-family with a=\\\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\\\rho_\\\\infty) further improves the period accuracy at the cost of lower amplitude accuracy.  Analysis  In structural dynamics, the test model for property analysis is the single degree-of-freedom homogeneous equation, as \\\\ddot{u}+2\\\\xi\\\\omega\\\\dot{u}+\\\\omega^2u=0 Here \\\\xi is the damping ratio and \\\\omega is the natural frequency. Applying the composite method to the test model yields the compact scheme X_{k+1}=AX_{k} Here X_{k}={u_k;\\\\dot{u}_k;\\\\ddot{u}_k} and A is the amplitude matrix, which governs the properties of a method. Generally, A has one zero characteristic root and a pair of conjugate complex roots \\\\lambda_{1,2}, which can be solved from \\\\lambda^2-A_1\\\\lambda+A_2=0 Here A_1 is the trace of A and A_2 is the sum of second-order principal minors of A. They are functions of \\\\xi, \\\\omega h, and the parameters of the method.  Accuracy  From the compact scheme, the difference equation only with respect to the displacement can be written as u_{k+1}-A_1u_{k}+A_2u_{k-1}=0 The local truncation error \\\\sigma is defined as \\\\sigma=u(t_{k+1})-A_1u(t_{k})+A_2u(t_{k-1}) The method is called sth-order accurate if \\\\sigma=O(h^{s+1}).  Stability  For physically stable systems (\\\\xi\\\\geq0, \\\\omega\\\\geq0), the method can give stable solutions if the spectral radius \\\\rho=\\\\max{\\\\lambda}\\\\leq1. A method is called unconditionally stable if the condition \\\\rho\\\\leq1 is satisfied for any h\\\\geq0, otherwise it is called conditionally stable. The spectral radius at the high-frequency limit, i.e. \\\\omega h\\\\rightarrow+\\\\infty, is denoted as \\\\rho_\\\\infty, which is usually employed to indicate the degree of numerical dissipation, as used above.  Amplitude decay ratio and period elongation ratio  In addition to the accuracy order, the amplitude decay ratio and period elongation ratio are also usually evaluated to measure the amplitude and period accuracy in the low- frequency content. The exact solution of the test model is u(t)=\\\\text{e}^{-\\\\xi\\\\omega t}(c_1\\\\cos\\\\omega_dt+c_2\\\\sin\\\\omega_dt),\\\\omega_d=\\\\omega\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\xi^2} Here c_1 and c_2 are constants determined by the initial conditions. The numerical solution can be also expressed as a similar form, as u_k=\\\\text{e}^{-\\\\overline{\\\\xi}\\\\overline{\\\\omega}t_k}(\\\\overline{c}_1\\\\cos\\\\overline{\\\\omega}_dt_k+\\\\overline{c}_2\\\\sin\\\\overline{\\\\omega}_dt_k),\\\\overline{\\\\omega}_d=\\\\overline{\\\\omega}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\overline{\\\\xi}^2} Likewise, \\\\overline{c}_1 and \\\\overline{c}_2 are also determined by the initial conditions and they should be close to c_1 and c_2 respectively for a convergent method. The damping ratio \\\\overline{\\\\xi} and frequency \\\\overline{\\\\omega} can be obtained from the norm \\\\lambda and phase \\\\angle\\\\lambda, as \\\\overline{\\\\xi}=-\\\\frac{\\\\ln\\\\lambda}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\angle\\\\lambda)^2+(\\\\ln\\\\lambda)^2}},\\\\overline{\\\\omega}=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\angle\\\\lambda)^2+(\\\\ln\\\\lambda)^2}}{h} Here \\\\overline{\\\\xi} is called the amplitude decay ratio, and \\\\frac{\\\\overline{T}-T}{T} (\\\\overline{T}=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\overline{\\\\omega}},T=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\omega}) is called the period elongation ratio.  Example  Spectral radius of the Bathe method Amplitude decay ratio of the Bathe method Period elongation ratio of the Bathe method Consider the Bathe method, A_1 and A_2 have the form as A_1=\\\\frac{2(\\\\gamma^4-4\\\\gamma^3+6\\\\gamma^2-4)\\\\omega^2h^2+8(\\\\gamma-2)^2}{(\\\\gamma^2\\\\omega^2h^2+4)((\\\\gamma-1)^2\\\\omega^2h^2+(\\\\gamma-2)^2)} A_2=\\\\frac{(\\\\gamma^4-4\\\\gamma^3+8\\\\gamma^2-8\\\\gamma+4)\\\\omega^2h^2+4(\\\\gamma-2)^2}{(\\\\gamma^2\\\\omega^2h^2+4)((\\\\gamma-1)^2\\\\omega^2h^2+(\\\\gamma-2)^2)} Here the undamped case, i.e. \\\\xi=0, is considered for simplicity. One can check that this method can satisfy the conditions of second-order accuracy and unconditional stability. With \\\\gamma=\\\\frac{1}{2} and 2-\\\\sqrt{2}, the spectral radius, amplitude decay ratio, and period elongation ratio are shown here. It can be observed that this method can provide good amplitude and period accuracy in the low-frequency content, while strong numerical dissipation, as \\\\rho_\\\\infty=0, in the high-frequency content.

The name Gallaeci or Callaeci gave name to a large tribal confederation of the same name (the Gallaeci) in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, and also gave name to the region of Gallaecia (roughly today's Galicia and Northern Portugal, and also included Asturias and part of León). Neighbouring this tribe, to the north were the Bracari and the Narbasi, to the northeast were the Narbasi and some of the Nemetati, to the east (low valley of the Tâmega river) were the Tongobrigenses, all of which were also Gallaecian tribes. To their south (south of the Douro river) were the Turduli Veteres, a tribe part of the Turduli, and to their southeast (south of the Douro river) were the Paesuri, a tribe part of the Lusitanians and to their west was the Atlantic coast. Culturally they were part of the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age Castro Culture. Their territory was in a strategic position at the low course of the Douro river, because land and maritime routes, including trade routes, crossed their territory between the north and the south or vice versa, and from the east to the west or vice versa. The Roman general Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus conquered their land and founded the Roman city Portus Cale in around 136 BC (today's Porto or Oporto city) based on or close to an older Celtic village and fortress (a Castro) that was on the top of a hill on the north bank of the Douro river close to its mouth or estuary but more to the inland. The Place Name (Toponym) Portus Cale later would gave origin to the name Portugal (the country).

Researcher at the Research Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kharkiv. Author of the concept of economic self-sufficiency of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  Biography  Mykhailo Volobuiev was born in Mykolaiv. He studied at the gymnasium, graduated from the economics department of the University of Kharkiv. From 1921 to 1922 he worked as deputy head of the Mykolayiv Provincial Department of Education, and in 1922 as deputy head of the Vinnytsia Department. From 1923 he worked in Kharkiv at the Central Administration for Political Education, taught at the Kharkiv Pharmaceutical Technical School, the Kharkiv Institute of People's Education, and the Financial and Economic Technical School. Later he became a professor of political economy at the Kharkiv Mechanical and Machine-Building Institute (1930—1933 — head of the department).  Views  In 1928, Volobuiev's article (submitted to the editorial office in 1927) entitled \\"On the Problem of the Ukrainian Economy\\" was published in the \\"Bolshevik of Ukraine\\" (Bil’shovyk Ukraïny) magazine (the main theoretical journal of the Communist Party of Ukraine). The article, which was debatable, outlined the phases of development of the tsar's colonial policy in Ukraine before the October events of 1917 and refuted the version of the complete unity of the pre-revolutionary Russian economy. According to Volobuiev, this economy was united on an antagonistic imperialist basis, but, in terms of the centrifugal forces of the colonies oppressed by it, it was a complex of national economies. According to Volobuiev, the only economic complex was Ukraine, which, however, was ignored by both Russian economists and Moscow governing bodies (including the USSR State Plan), which generally avoided even the name \\"Ukraine\\", preferring the terms \\"South\\", \\"Southern District\\", \\" South-West \\", \\"South of European Russia \\", \\"South-Russian economy\\", considering Ukraine a colony of the European type, which became part of the USSR. Volobuiev stated that Ukraine has all the hallmarks of a Russian colony and is economically exploited by it.Гунчак Тарас. Україна: перша половина XX століття: Нариси політичної історії.— К.: Либідь, 1993.— С. 193. Therefore, he showed that Russian imperialism combined with Russian chauvinism and central control of the economy resulted in exploitation colonialism of Ukraine. Volobuiev argued that Ukraine had right to control its economic development and its national budget. Thus it had its own paths of development and that it must prepare for joining the world economy in the case of a victory of the revolution \\"not only in the former Russia, but throughout the globe\\" as an equal part of this world complex.  Reaction  His views gained wide support in Ukraine and later this line of thought was named Volobuievism. At the same time his statements were attacked by Party authorities as ‘bourgeois nationalist’ and anti-Soviet. Consequently, he was forced to recant of his ideas. For this purpose, he wrote a letter to Komunist magazine (1928) and a two-part article in \\"Bolshevik of Ukraine\\" (Bil’shovyk Ukraïny) (1930) titled \\"Against the Economic Platform of Nationalism [Toward a Criticism of Volobuievism]'. On December 7, 1933, Volobuiev was arrested on charges of participating in a \\"Ukrainian counterrevolutionary organization that sought to overthrow the Soviet government by force.\\" During the interrogation, he “confessed” that he had been recruited by Mykola Khvylovy to a “counterrevolutionary Ukrainian organization”. By the decision of the three judges at the Board of the GPU of the USSR of May 8, 1934, Volobuiev was sentenced in a concentration camp for 5 years (the sentence was commuted to exile in Kazakhstan). However, he was released just in 1943. After serving his term he lived in the Krasnodar Territory. In 1957 he was rehabilitated. Since 1961 he worked in the Economics and Trade Institute in Donetsk for several years.

Plot At home in Buenos Aires, Clara hears strange voices coming from the plughole in her kitchen sink. Her husband, Juan, is perplexed when she reports that they were discussing a plan to kill her. That night, awakened by thumping sounds he assumes at first to be coming from the house next-door, Juan is horrified to find Clara's dead body hovering in midair in their bathroom, violently and repeatedly slamming against the wall as if thrown by an invisible force. Walter, who lives next-door, is also experiencing supernatural occurrences. Each night, as he tries to sleep, invisible forces shake and move his furniture, including his bed. When he uses a video camera to film the events, he sees a tall, naked figure emerging from the wardrobe, standing over him as he sleeps, and crawling beneath the bed. Across the road, Alicia is grieving the death of her young son, who has recently been hit by a bus outside Walter's house. Paranormal investigator, Jano, arrives at the behest of Alicia's ex-boyfriend, Comisario Funes, who reveals that the corpse of the dead boy is currently sitting at the kitchen table, having apparently returned from the cemetery, leaving a trail of muddy footprints behind it. After deliberating, the two eventually move the now inanimate corpse to an outside freezer. Nearby, Jano bumps into another paranormal investigator, Mora Albreck, whom he recognizes from the conference circuit. She has arrived to meet Walter, after viewing the video recordings he had sent her, but he now appears to have gone missing, leaving his house standing empty. Together with Rosenstock, another supernatural researcher, Jano and Albreck visit Juan, who is now the main suspect in his wife's murder and is being held in a psychiatric facility. Assuring him that they believe his story, they ask permission to investigate his house, which he grants. Soon after, the specialists return to the troubled street, before separating to investigate one property each over the course of one night. Comisario Funes accompanies Rosenstock, who is based at Alicia's house. As weird phenomena occur and the investigators begin to die in gruesome and inexplicable ways, Funes realizes he has no choice but to flee the scene or risk losing his own life. Back at the psychiatric facility, the police attempt to further question Juan but he is distracted by the figure of a tall man he says is behind them. They turn around, seeing nothing except for an empty chair. Suddenly, the chair flies towards the camera, hurled by an invisible force.

In 1953, Courts and Rev. George W. Lee founded the Humphreys County, Mississippi chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). As he led a voting rights and registration drive, Courts was shot and wounded at his store and later testified to Congress about racial terror in Mississippi. Biography Gus Courts was born in Pickens, and owned a grocery store in Belzoni, Mississippi. Courts was involved in the local civil rights movement in the 1940s. He cooperated with the Regional Council of Negro Leadership, and in 1953 co- founded the Humphreys County chapter of the NAACP with Rev. George Lee. In Humpheys County, 70% of the population was African American, but although the county had about 16,000 voting age African Americans in the 1950s, no African American had voted in the county since Reconstruction in the 19th century. Courts and Lee were able to persuade 400 potential voters to pay the poll tax, as the first step in registering to vote in the county at the time. Despite physical and economic threats from the county's white power structure and obstruction from county registrars, 94 of them took the dangerous and difficult step to register. As the registration drive was making some headway in May 1955, Rev. Lee was gunned down on a Belzoni street by white supremacists, in a still unsolved murder. Voting registrations fell after the murder, but on the next election day, Courts held a meeting at his store and 22 people volunteered to go to the polls to vote. Although warned of the danger, they marched to the court house. There, county clerks handed them questionnaires about their identities and civil rights opinions -- all were refused the vote. Continued threats and the failed attempt to vote soon left only one African American registered to vote in the county -- Gus Courts, and he refused to de-register. Six months after Lee's killing, Courts was shot in the front of his grocery store. Despite severe wounds, his friends managed to get him to a hospital eighty-miles away. Courts had to go so far for emergency medical treatment because the local hospital was segregated. Courts survived the shooting but concluded he and his wife had to leave Mississippi, reluctantly joining the Great Migration. They moved to Chicago and in 1957, he testified before Congress on his experiences and the racial terror in his home state. Courts, starting again at age 65, opened and ran a store in Chicago. He died in 1969, never realizing his wish to return to Mississippi.

Subfamily classification  The Platystomatidae were comprehensively divided into five subfamilies Frey, R (1932). On African Platystomatidae (Diptera). Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Series 10. 9: 242–264., but more recent reviews of morphology suggest that some aspects of this classification are unsatisfactory. This led to reducing the number of subfamilies to four, being the Plastotephritinae, Platystomatinae, Scholastinae and Trapherinae - Angitulinae being subsumed into Platystomatinae. Nonetheless, definition of the subfamily Scholastinae is still open to debate and requires phylogenetic confirmation. At present, genera assigned to the subfamily are considered as having the following subset of characters: fully developed calypters, tergite 5 much shorter than tergite 3 (especially in females where it may be absent), distiphallus terminating at the glans often with terminal filaments and tergite 6 in the female abdomen absent. Although McAlpine rejected the use of the presence of an anepisternal (=sternopleural) seta, Whittington more recently continued to use it as it provides an additional character besides those given above, all of which are transitional to some extent in the other subfamilies of the Platystomatidae. In particular, head and genitalic morphology, and perhaps larval biology once more of this is known, should play a role in the definition of the subfamilies, the debate for which remains open. Three of the 14 genera in the Scholastinae are monotypic: Chaetorivellia, Pseudoscholastes and Tomeus.  Biology  Little is known of the biology of Scholastines. Adults have been taken on leaves of bananas - Musa Musa, rubber - Hevea Hevea, coconuts - Cocos Cocos, Xanthorrhoea Xanthorrhoea, Eucalyptus Eucalyptus and Macrozamia Macrozamia. Habitats in which they are encountered range therefore from rainforest, dry forests, coastal forest, coastal heaths, and agricultural land. Larvae are sometimes associated with the sap runs of boring beetles, but the association is unclear and requires further investigation.  Biogeography  Without doubt, the largest concentration of species of Scholastinae occurs in the Austalasian region. The subfamily is entirely absent from the Americas and the Palaearctic. There are five genera known from the Afrotropical region, seven from the Oriental (five of which also occur in the Australasia region) and 12 from Australasia. Naupoda and Scholastes are the only two genera to be distributed across all three regions and Paryphodes is found in both the Afrotropical and Australasian regions.

Biography = Family provenance  Henriette Marie Verena Rodewald was born (and slightly more than seventy-one years later died) in Bremen. She was born into one of the city's leading mercantile families, the third of her parents' six recorded children. Hermann Georg Rodewald (1814–1891), her father, like his father before him, was an internationally connected businessman. Her mother, born Marie Christine Verena Gildemeister (1840–1914), came from another of the city's leading families, and was a cousin of the journalist-politician (and four times mayor of Bremen), Otto Gildemeister (1823–1902). As she grew up the family lived at Kohlkökerstraße 10, close to the city centre. Verena's younger brother, Hermann Rodewald, later came to prominence as a merchant and senator.  Training  After starting out at an elementary school Verena Rodewald switched to the girls' school of Helene Laweg und Sophie Petr. She then followed the Gymnasium (secondary school) course for women in Berlin between 1897 and 1899. The Gymnasium (secondary school system) was designed to prepare students – under most circumstances only male students – for admission to a university. In 1901 she passed the Abitur (school final exam) at Bremen's Altes Gymnasium (boys' secondary school). There seems to have been an acceptance, by this time, that she was unlikely ever to marry, and the alternative path would have involved finding a respectable career, such as teaching. With the full support – emotionally and financially – of her family she attended the universities of Berlin, Kiel and Heidelberg, studying Germanistics, Anglistics, Philosophy and Philology. Sources are silent over whether she was every permitted to conclude her undergraduate studies by obtaining a first degree. It is known, however, that in 1908 Verena Rodewald received her doctorate from the University of Heidelberg. Her dissertation concerned the use of the \\"aside\\" as a device in German theatre. Rodewald was one of the first women anywhere in the German empire to be permitted to receive a doctorate. It is perhaps a sign both of the hurdles she had to overcome and of the extent to which her parents were willing and able to support her financially that by the time she received her doctorate she was 42.  Women's rights  Instead of launching herself in a paid professional role, Rodewald now returned from Heidelberg to Bremen where she became a public campaigner for women's rights, with a particular focus of her own on questions surrounding education. The next two years were devoted to co- founding the Bremen \\"Frauenstadtbund\\", an umbrella organisation embracing, at the outset, 15 different women's organisations, such as local branches of the League for Protection of Mothers and Sexual reform (\\"Deutscher Bund für Mutterschutz und Sexualreform\\") and of the German Association for Women's Voting rights (\\"Deutscher Verband für Frauenstimmrecht\\"). The Bremen \\"Frauenstadtbund\\", of which in 1910 she became the first president, thereby came to represent around 600 women. Rodewald led it between 1910 and 1915, and then again between 1917 and 1925. During her second term in office the \\"Frauenstadtbund\\" changed its name, in 1923, to \\"Bremer Frauenverein\\" (BDF)\\". By 1925 the number of Bremen women's organisations affiliated to it had increased from 15 to 43. Along with the associations already mentioned, these included the \\"Bremen Women's Club of 1908\\", the \\"Bremen [anti-drunkenness] Moderation Association\\" (\\"Bremer Mäßigkeitsverein\\") and other temperance organisations, the \\"Bremen Association for Improving Women's Clothing\\", the \\"Bremen local group\\" (\\"Ortsgruppe Bremen\\"), the \\"Business Association for Women Employees\\" (\\"Kaufmännischer Verband für weibliche Angestellte\\"), \\"Financial Support Fund for Weekly Carers\\", the \\"Bremen Sisterhood of the German Professional Nurses Professional Association\\", the \\"Association of Bremen midwives\\", the \\"Association of Bremen (women) Teachers\\", the \\"Association of Bremen (women) Painters\\", the \\"Women's Work Association\\", the \\"Mothers and Infants Refuge Association\\" (\\"Verein Mütter- und Säuglingsheim\\") and the Bremen branch of the anti-prostitution \\"International Abolitionist Federation\\". Verena Rodewald had become an important force in the Bremen women's movement, and she saw to it that the \\"Bremer Frauenverein\\" became too important a voice for the citizens and city authorities to ignore. In her first petition to the senate Verena Rodewald set out the goals of the Frauenstadtbund: \\"The Frauenstadtbund aims to unite all the Bremen women's organisations striving to advance the cause of women in respect of economic, social, legal and intellectual matters, and thereby to advance the common good. It exists to communicate their shared wishes and demands to the legislators.\\" Rodewald went on to submit several further petitions both to the senate and to the Bürgerschaft (state parliament) in which she took hold of contemporary problems, and applied her characteristically stubborn persistence in working towards solutions. Her top priorities were in respect of emancipation and voting rights. Politics The so-called November Revolution (1918/19) started in the Imperial Navy at Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, quickly spreading across to the cities and towns of the newly republican German state. In Bremen it found expression in a soldiers', sailors' and workers' soviet which exercised a form of democratic control over the city territories for 25 days during January and February 1919, by means of a \\"Bürgerausschuss\\" (\\"Citizens' Committee\\"). Within the \\"Bürgerausschuss\\" were represented not just the revolutionaries but also conservative and liberal citizens. These demanded a \\"military ending\\" to the political uncertainty on which the revolutionary elements had evidently embarked. Many observers were surprised by Verena Rodewald's election to the citizens' committee. One explanation is that men from Bremen's prosperous middle classes, fearful of losing their privileged position in the face of revolution, suddenly found it expedient to create an ad hoc alliance with politically noisy middle class women, if only to give greater numerical weight to their own political demands. The irony is not lost on commentators that it was precisely these same middle class men who had hitherto vehemently opposed women's participation in politics. Nevertheless, everything about Verena Rodewald provided her backers with reassurance that in the event of a full-blown German re-run of Russia's October revolution, she would be strident and effective in opposing any tides of Bolshevism from the east. In July 1919 the new German constitution confirmed the abolition of gender discrimination in respect of voting rights and entitlement to public office. Verena Rodewald was one of 18 female members elected to the newly inaugurated Bremen National Assembly three months earlier, on 9 March 1919. It was the first election held in which Bremen women were permitted to vote. Following the election of 6 June 1920, having produced and ratified a new constitution for the state, the National Assembly in effect mutated into a reformed version of the Bürgerschaft (Bremen state parliament). While still a National Assembly member, Rodewald opted for membership of the centre-right People's Party (\\"Deutsche Volkspartei\\" / DVP). She continued to sit as a DVP member of the Bürgerschaft till the abolition of democracy in 1933. Rodewald became a member of the People's Party (\\"Deutsche Volkspartei\\" / DVP) party executive and led the Bremen DVP women's group until this was replaced, in 1921, by a Women's Committee chaired by the feminist activist and education reformer, Dr. Johanna Lürssen. During her fourteen years as a member of the Bremen state parliament she engaged with commitment in matters touching on women's rights and equality of rights and entitlements, but these were not the only topics in which she took an interest. In her 37 substantial contributions to Bürgerschaft debates her comments were mainly on problems of the health system, culture and the arts, and on education and training. Although she was not a member of the parliamentary education group, she focused strongly on professional training for women and girls, and spoke out against one-dimensional role-allocations deriving from educational precepts. She warned that girls' whose only training and experience was focused on housekeeping would never advance beyond a very one-sided orientation. One specific campaign in which she involved herself was for the preservation of women-only bathing establishments along the river. She campaigned for the inclusion of women delegates on the government boards of schools and for the provision of state aid to theatres. She was a strong advocate of religious education in the city's schools and called for the authorities to look after prostitutes who had become infected with sexually transmitted diseases through their work. She contributed a number of articles to \\"Roland\\", a regional party newspaper, dealing with women's right to vote, in which she criticised the attitudes of all the political parties, analysing the position as it then stood, and not fearing to impute some of the responsibility for the situation she criticised to women themselves. At the beginning of 1933, exploiting the intensifying political polarisation and the resulting parliamentary deadlock, the Hitler government took power, and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one- party dictatorship. The DVP was now the \\"wrong party\\". Many of her party colleagues joined the National Socialist Party to sustain their political careers. Verena Rodewald preferred to withdraw from politics completely, retreating to lead a private life during her final years.  Evaluation  To a twenty-first century observer Verena Rodewald's views provide a singular blend of extreme conservatism and the strikingly progressive. She was a highly intelligent, well-educated and combative woman, at once confident in her views and capable of singular humility, stubborn in pursuit of her objectives. It was a combination which, perhaps, marked her out from the outset for a career in politics and women's rights activism.

His highest rank was ōzeki. He was a member of the Tomozuna and Takasago stable. After retiring in 1927 he was an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name of Naruto. Career He was born Masaharu Hatta in Mikasa, Sorachi District, Hokkaido, the second son of a miner. In the summer of 1912 in Sapporo he met the yokozuna Tachiyama, who recruited him to Tomozuna stable. He made his professional debut in January 1913. Despite his short height he was extremely flexible, able to throw his opponents with both his right hand grip and left hand grip. He was transferred to Takasago stable in May 1919 when his stablemaster Tachiyama (by then going by the elder name Azumazeki) abruptly quit the sumo world. He was diligent about training and reached the top makuuchi division in January 1921. In May 1922 he won his first (and only) kinboshi by defeating Ōnishiki Uichirō, who had not lost a bout in two years and had also defeated Tachiyama in the latter's last ever bout in January 1917. This in fact turned out to be Ōnishiki's last bout as well, as he quit sumo in the wake of the strike against the Tokyo Sumo Association known as the Mikawajima-Incident. Following this performance Tachihikari was promoted to sekiwake in January 1923 and to ōzeki in May 1923, ahead of the more favoured . He was the first ōzeki of the newly established Japan Sumo Association, formed from a merger of the Tokyo and Osaka associations. Although he did not win any championships at the ōzeki rank he continued to have good results until he hurt his right leg in a match against in May 1926. In the four tournaments following that injury he only took part in three bouts, and he finally retired in October 1927 having lost his ōzeki rank. Retirement from sumo He became a toshiyori or elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Naruto Oyakata, affiliated to Takasago stable. In 1937 he took part the kanreki dohyo-iri ceremony to mark Tachiyama's 60th birthday, in the role of sword-bearer. In May 1951 he quit the Sumo Association following disagreements with Takasago's stablemaster, ex- Maedayama, that saw him transfer briefly to Tatsunami stable. He returned to his hometown to start full-time operations of a restaurant that he had begun in Otaru. He died in May 1952 at the age of 55. His shikona was subsequently used by two other sekitori, , a university graduate who was in jūryō in 1970, and , a maegashira in the 1990s.

Born in Kaiserslautern, Etzkorn completed an apprenticeship as a hairdresser, then travelled as a journeyman to the Rhein-Main area. In 1892, he joined the Union of German Barbers, Hairdressers and Wig Makers, and in 1893, he moved to Pforzheim, and formed a branch of the union there. Over the next two years, he was repeatedly sacked for union activity, and moved to new cities. In 1896, he was appointed as the editor of the union's newspaper, the Barbier- und Friseur-Zeitung, and moved to Berlin to undertake the role. While Etzkorn was based in Berlin, the union's leader, Carl Wesche, was in Braunschweig, and at the end of the year, Etzkorn also moved there. The union steadily lost members, and by 1898 was in serious financial difficulties. Etzkorn returned to Pforzheim, and focused his time on the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Wesche was in serious disagreement with Etzkorn over the direction of the union, and in 1899, he had Etzkorn expelled. Etzkorn remained a popular figure among union members, and was admitted to the Stuttgart branch, in defiance of Wesche. In 1900, Wesche was voted out of office, and Etzkorn was narrowly elected as his successor. He moved the union's headquarters to Hamburg, and polled 300 young union members on their experiences and priorities for the union. He focused on keeping the union united, and restricting the number of apprentices. The union grew steadily under Etzkorn's leadership, from 869 members in 1905, to 2,500 in 1914. In 1907, Etzkorn persuaded members to move the headquarters to Berlin. That year, he also founded the International Union of Hairdressers, serving as its general secretary. He kept the union together during World War I, although the union had to give up its headquarters and make all its paid staff redundant. From 1916, he supported himself by working as a clerk for the General Commission of German Trade Unions, although after the November Revolution, he was again able to work full-time for the union. Etzkorn resigned as president of the union, now called the Union of Hairdressers and Assistants, in 1921, and became the trade union editor of Vorwärts, the SPD newspaper. He remained secretary of the international federation, and in 1928 was made honorary vice president of his old union. In 1932, it merged into the General Union of Public Sector and Transport Workers, and Etzkorn became an honorary president of its municipal section. In 1933, the Nazi government banned trade unions, and Etzkorn lost his job. He was unemployed until 1938, when he finally found work as a registrar. He survived World War II, and at the end of the war joined the refounded SPD, dying early in 1946.

It was obtained through a security breach of Netsential, a web developer that works with fusion centers and law enforcement. The leaks were released at hunter.ddosecrets.com and announced on the @DDoSecrets Twitter account. The account was banned shortly after for \\"dissemination of hacked materials\\" and \\"information that could have put individuals at risk of real- world harm.\\" Wired reported that Distributed Denial of Secrets attempted to remove sensitive information from the data before publication. National Fusion Center Association (NFCA) officials confirmed the authenticity of the data, according to documents obtained by security journalist Brian Krebs; the organization warned its members that hackers may use the leaked information to target them.  Background  The Blue Leaks data comes largely from the intelligence gathered by fusion centers. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States government sought to improve communication between different levels of law enforcement to better discover and prevent terrorist attacks. They encouraged state and local governments to create fusion centers: physical locations where representatives of different law enforcement agencies share and collectively analyze intelligence before distributing reports back to their respective agencies. Fusion centers have since begun working with private \\"data brokers\\" with little public oversight. Fusion centers have been criticized as privacy-invading, ineffective, and targeted at political groups. In 2012, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that over the 13 months of review, fusion centers did not contribute to the identification or prevention of a terrorist plot, and that of the 386 unclassified fusion center reports it reviewed, three-quarters had no connection to terrorism at all. In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security identified a number of privacy-related concerns created by fusion centers. The Department noted that the excessive secrecy of fusion centers led to comparisons with COINTELPRO, and that fusion center reports sometimes distribute inaccurate or incomplete information. The 2012 Senate report points to a report issued by an Illinois fusion center in 2011. The report wrongly claimed that Russian hackers were to blame for a broken water pump, and despite the Department of Homeland Security publicly stating the report was false, its Office of Intelligence and Analysis included the claims in its report to Congress. After the killing of George Floyd and other instances of police violence in 2020, law enforcement in the United States came under renewed scrutiny. In early June, the hacker collective Anonymous announced its intent to expose police misconduct. The collective did high-profile hacks in the 2000s and early 2010s. In 2011, Antisec, a subgroup of Anonymous, released law enforcement information in support of Occupy Wall Street protestors, but the collective had few significant operations within the United States since then.  Findings  The BlueLeaks collection includes internal memos, financial records, and more from over 200 state, local, and federal agencies. More than one million documents were leaked from law enforcement fusion centers. In leaked documents, officers track individual, group, and event pages with protest or anti-law enforcement rhetoric. Some of the documents contain material related to the attitudes of law enforcement and their response to the Black Lives Matter movement, George Floyd protests, and COVID-19 pandemic. During the George Floyd protests, law enforcement agencies monitored protesters' communications over social media and messaging apps. Reports leaked found that the police were aware of the potential for their surveillance to violate the Constitution. They distributed documents to police filled with rumors and warnings that the protests would become violent, sparking fear among police officers. The documents also show a much broader trend of surveillance. They show details about the data that police can obtain from social media sites including Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Reddit and Tumblr, among others. Fusion centers also collect and distribute detailed data from automatic license plate readers. Surveys from law enforcement training programs reveal that some instructors were prejudiced and unprofessional. Classes taught biased, outdated, and incorrect content. Some contain sexual content unrelated to the class, and there was one report of an instructor admitting to lying in court frequently. In Maine, legislators took interest in BlueLeaks thanks to details about the Maine Information and Analysis Center, which is under investigation. The leaks showed the fusion center was spying on and keeping records on people who legally protesting or had been \\"suspicious\\" but committed no crime. Documents also contain reports about other countries from the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of State and other agencies. Officials discussed cyber attacks from Iran and concerns about further attacks in early 2020. Another report discusses possible Chinese espionage at natural gas facilities. Homeland Security also discussed Russian interference with American elections, attempts to hack the 2020 census, and manipulation of social media discussion.  Google's CyberCrime Investigation Group  On August 21, The Guardian revealed, based on the leaked documents, the existence of Google's \\"CyberCrime Investigation Group\\" (CIG). The group focused on voluntarily forwarding detailed information of Google, YouTube and Gmail users, among other products, to members of the Northern California Regional Intelligence, a counter-terrorist fusion center, for content threatening violence or otherwise expressing extremist views, often associated with the far right. The company has also been said to report users who appeared to be in mental distress, indicating suicidal thoughts or intent to commit self-harm. One way Google identified its users in order to report them to law enforcement was by cross-referencing different Gmail accounts that eventually led them to a single Android phone. In some cases the company did not ban the users they reported to the authorities, and some were said to still have accounts on YouTube, Gmail and other services.  Response  Shortly after the leaks were released, on June 23, Twitter permanently banned DDoSecrets's Twitter account for distributing hacked materials. Twitter also censored all links to the DDoSecrets website. German authorities seized a server used by DDoSecrets at the request of U.S. authorities. The server had hosted the BlueLeaks files, but the documents remained available for download through BitTorrent and other websites. On July 9, Reddit banned r/BlueLeaks, a community created to discuss BlueLeaks, claiming they had posted personal information. There is a federal investigation relating to BlueLeaks. Various Freedom of Information Act requests filed about BlueLeaks and DDoSecrets were rejected due to an ongoing federal investigation. Homeland Security Investigations has questioned at least one person, seeking information about BlueLeaks and DDoSecrets.

He spent much of his career in the London County Council's architects' department, before retiring early to focus on private work. He was a long-term active member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, from 1898 onwards. He joined the Art Workers' Guild in 1917, served on the committee from 1927 to 1929, and helped to organise meetings and trips. He became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in the late 1920s.  Early life and education  Charles Winmill was born at his parents' home in Balaam Street, Plaistow, East London, on 14 January 1865. His father was William Hill Winmill of West Ham, and his mother was Fanny Sarah (née Mumford) of Henham, Essex (they were married at St Mary's Church, Plaistow, on 7 November 1863). A second son, Hallett, was born in 1867, and the family moved to Forest Gate. They moved again in the autumn of 1868, to The Elms, Gorleston, Norfolk, from where they had a view of the sea (William's profession was connected with fishing boats and ships). William was injured in an accident in early 1869 and died in Yarmouth Hospital on 15 April. His widow gave birth to a third son, William, on 28 July 1869, and soon after this she took her three sons with her to live with an elderly aunt in the village of Newport, in her home county of Essex. In about 1870 the family moved to Augusta Villa, Ramsgate, Kent, where Fanny ran a girls' boarding and day school: she was a good artist and taught drawing. Around this time Charles enjoyed going on country walks, looking at old buildings and ruins, which led to an early interest in architecture. In 1875 he attended Christ's Hospital School in the City of London, which he found a rather tough environment: he was good at drawing, but disliked exams. In 1880 he went for a year to Wenbigh Grammar School in Thornton Heath, where the headmaster, a Reverend T. H. Roberts, described the young Charles as 'perverse to the last'. In early 1881, Winmill's mother arranged his first employment, in the manifest department at Millwall Docks, where he earned 10 shillings per week. From 17 January 1881, in order to be near to his work, he lodged with an elderly Frenchman at 81 Blackheath Hill, in south-east London, a tall red-brick house. The following year, Fanny gave up her school in Ramsgate and moved to Greenwich, so that all three of her sons could live with her. On dark winter mornings Charles taught his younger brother Hallett to cycle on a 52\\" Excelsior bicycle on Blackheath. In the mid-1880s, Charles joined the Artists' Rifles as a volunteer, and served for five years as a private; during manoeuvres on Wimbledon Common he once took a 'prisoner' who turned out to be the young Winston Churchill, about twelve years old at the time.  Professional work = Early training  In about 1884 Charles was articled to John T. Newman of 2 Fenchurch Court, an architect and surveyor to the West Ham Board. Charles learned a great deal from Newman, at the same time attending evening classes in design at the Architectural Association, at 9 Conduit Street. The Architectural Association's motto was 'Design with Beauty, Build in Truth', a concept which Charles took to heart and followed throughout his career. In 1888 he left Newman's practice to become assistant to Leonard Stokes, a leading Roman Catholic architect with premises at 7 Storeys Gate, Westminster. During these early years, Winmill became strongly influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, led by the writer and designer William Morris and the architect Philip Webb, other architectural and design influences including William Richard Lethaby and Charles Voysey. Winmill remained with Stokes for four years, until moving on to the London County Council, where he was to spend the larger part of his career.  London County Council (LCC)  Winmill worked for the London County Council for 31 years, from 1892 to 1923. He worked in the architects' department, where he was responsible mainly for social housing and fire stations. In the early days he was based at the old LCC offices in Spring Gardens, London SW1. The first building he designed for the LCC was a row of cottages in Goldsmith's Row, Hackney, East London. Other schemes he was involved in included slum clearance and replanning of part of Shoreditch, as well as work in Bethnal Green and the Tabard Street area of Southwark. A large part of Winmill's work was for the LCC's fire brigade section, under the leadership of Robert Pearsall. On 19 November 1897 there was a serious fire in Cripplegate, during which warehouses were destroyed, and it was decided that a new fire station was needed for the area. Winmill was put in charge, and the Red Cross Street fire station was completed in 1900, with its formal opening taking place on 23 February 1901. In December 1899 Winmill had become second in command of the LCC fire brigade section, helping to implement a five-year plan to double the number of fire stations in London, with a target of six per year. Another responsibility was the annual inspection of all London fire stations, during which he would note any requirements for alterations and additions. His LCC work was very demanding during the First World War, as the fire brigade section was very short- staffed. Around this time an innovation from America was the installation of sliding poles in fire stations, replacing staircases. Another was the gradual replacement of horses by motorised engines. All of these changes required design changes to the fire station buildings. To coordinate this, Winmill worked well with the London Fire Brigade's Chief Officer, Sir Sampson Sladen. He also got on well with the politicians John Burns, a leading LCC council member and MP, and George Lansbury, a Poplar council member and MP. In 1913 work on the new LCC County Hall building began; progress was slow because of the First World War, but Winmill moved into his new office there in around 1919, and the building was formally opened in 1922. In April 1919 Winmill had been promoted to 'principal assistant' and became head of his section, but he was less happy because of the shift of focus to administrative work. Then, in January 1923, an early retirement opportunity arose, and he was pleased to retire from the LCC at the end of September in order to concentrate on private commissions and his ongoing SPAB activities.  Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB)  The SPAB was formed to counteract what was regarded as destructive 19th century practices in the restoration of heritage buildings, including the scraping of ancient plaster off walls, and the romantic trend of allowing ivy to grow on buildings. Winmill joined the Society in 1898 and later served on the committee. He was on friendly terms with Philip Webb and Richard Lethaby, and did valuable work for the organisation throughout his career, contributing to the inspection, maintenance and repair of many medieval (and medieval style) buildings, especially churches, including: *St Augustine's Abbey (school roof), Ramsgate, Kent (now Grade II listed) * St Mary Stratford atte Bowe (saved from destruction) *Chingford Old Church, Essex (saved from destruction) *St Margaret's Church, Barking, Essex (now Grade I listed) * St Lawrence's Church, Aylesby, Lincolnshire (including a design for a font cover and a design for a prayer desk) Other buildings he visited were in Chard (Somerset), the Isle of Caldey (South West Wales), and Lundy Island (North Devon). His main criteria in this valuable work were craftsmanship and simplicity. His work on St Mary Stratford atte Bowe (a medieval church famous for being mentioned in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales) was especially significant: he co-wrote a report on its restoration with Webb, Lethaby and others in 1900, helped supervise the work, and saved the building from destruction. His detailed survey of St Margaret's Church, Barking, written in 1928, illustrates his professional attention to detail, his practical advice on finding the right builder, and the order in which the work should be carried out. He also shows his consideration for the feelings of the church's clergy and congregation who might be unhappy at his suggestions. He gives an overall estimate of costs for the renovation works (£1375), and mentions other items for later attention, including organ maintenance, gutters, heating, lighting, tower, walls, altar and altar rails. Continuing into his later life he advised SPAB on repairs to ancient buildings in Kent and Essex, and undertaking occasion architectural work, although by 1939 he was expressing his sadness about new trends that were doing damage to old buildings. According to Francis C Eeles, Secretary of the Central Council for the Care of Churches, Winmill steered a course between ensuring practical repairs while retaining as much of the original building as possible. Eeles states that Winmill did excellent work in bringing the old church at Chingford back into use when some people thought that it was beyond recovery and might be lost entirely. As an advisor for the Society in Essex and Kent, Winmill was able to promote good practice, and Eeles feels that Winmill himself being a churchman gave his work added meaning and sincerity. (Indeed, Winmill's daughter notes that in July 1944 her father disapproved of a stained glass window containing the words 'to the Glory of God' when it also had the sponsoring family's name displayed on it.) A similar assessment to that of Eeles came from a satisfied client, the Abbot of St Augustine's, Ramsgate, where Winmill advised on and supervised repairs to the Abbey school roof in 1934: the Abbot found Winmill to be a straightforward person of integrity, honesty and kindness, showing attention to detail in his work, and with a sense of humour.  Private work  An early private project which Winmill undertook while still with the LCC was for a 'House and Home' exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in the summer of 1911, organised by Philip Webb. The exhibits included examples of modern housing and 'homes of the past', for which Winmill created a full-sized model of the lower floor of a small house. A later exhibition project came in 1924, when he was involved in the planning of the 1888 room at the Palace of Arts (designed by Philip Webb), for the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley. From about 1923 onwards, for about 20 years, Winmill did private work for Dent publishers, maintaining, adapting and extending the company's printing and binding works at Letchworth, Hertfordshire, as well as their office building in London. Another commission in Letchworth was for a canteen at the Temple Press (an imprint of Dent), the opening of which he attended in December 1944. Winmill also designed homes for friends, for example two houses in West Street, Reigate, Surrey in 1923, in Merriott, Somerset in 1924, and 88 Ossulton Way, Finchley, North London, a four-bedroom detached house completed in 1934.  Notable buildings  left = Belsize Fire Station = Formerly known as St John's Wood Fire Station, Winmill designed this building as part of his work for the LCC. It is in Arts and Crafts style, with leaded rectangular windows, four lunette-shaped windows, various dormer windows set into the roof, tall chimneys, and a medieval-romanesque-style tower. Construction began in 1912 and the building opened in 1915. Located between Eton Avenue and Lancaster Grove NW3 in the London Borough of Camden, north-west London, Belsize Fire Station has been a Grade II* listed building since 1974. Originally designed and built for the London Fire Brigade, it provided residential accommodation for firefighters in a separate building in the style of a Kentish farmhouse. It closed as a fire station in 2014, and was converted to 'luxury apartment' residential use, now known as Belsize Park Firehouse. = All Saints' Parish Hall = 300x300px This building was a private commission for All Saint's Church, Blackheath, south-east London. At that time Winmill was living at 2 Eliot Place, Blackheath, and was attending the church. Construction work took place from 1927 to 1928, and the building was officially opened by Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein (1872–1956), granddaughter of Queen Victoria, on 3 November 1928. Located in Tranquil Vale SE3, in the London Borough of Lewisham, within the Blackheath conservation area, All Saints' Parish Hall is a locally listed building in Arts and Crafts style, with leaded rectangular windows in groups of three or four, deep windowsills on the interior and carefully designed metal window catches, three circular leaded windows on either side of the entrance door (one on the left, two on the right), dormer windows at roof level, and decorative mosaic-style design work on the front façade. It has had many uses over the years, both by the church itself and the local community, and has been the business premises of the Mary Evans Picture Library since late 1988. = Cherry Tree Public House = Winmill designed this public house, in Wood Lane, Dagenham, Essex, including the swinging sign outside, in 1929. It is a solid, symmetrical building with Georgian-style windows, an entrance porch, and dormer windows set into the roof.  Travel in the UK and overseas  Winmill visited a number of heritage locations, both in the UK and overseas, which would have influenced his architectural style. In the UK around the turn of the century he visited Kelmscott Manor in the Cotswolds, made famous as the home of William Morris, and he was lucky enough to be shown round the house by Morris's widow. Around the same time he visited Oxford, where he saw a tapestry by Morris and Burne-Jones, Adoration of the Magi, as well as Holman Hunt's painting, The Light of the World. During part of the First World War the Winmill family stayed at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in an old house on the Pantiles, from where he could visit the architect Philip Webb in Sussex, riding on a 'motor bicycle'. Another architect friend was Walter Shirley, who became 11th Earl Ferrers in 1911, and later went to live at the family seat at Staunton Harold, Leicestershire, where Winmill went to visit. Winmill also made about three holiday trips to the Scilly Isles, his last visit being in March 1935. He also visited a number of European countries, specifically to look at examples of architecture. For example around the turn of the century he went on a trip to Bruges, where he took time to sketch old buildings. He also had a holiday in northern Italy, where he visited Venice, Padua and Verona. In the late 1920s he made short trips to Paris and Dieppe, and in 1929 he made a longer trip to see the chateaux of the Loire, visiting Blois, Chartres, Loches, Chinon, Amboise and Tours. In the spring of 1937 he went on a trip to Greece, which included the Greek islands and Cyprus.  Private life  Winmill met his future wife, Anne Mary Dyer (1860-1956), during a family visit to St Albans in the late 1860s, when both of them were children. Soon after Winmill's mother died (19 January 1901), Charles and Anne became engaged. They married on 31 August 1901 (in Steyning, Sussex), and their daughter Joyce Mary, an only child, was born on 15 July 1903 (in Bexleyheath, Kent). Winmill lived in various locations in adult life. After a time at Woodford, Essex, in the early years of the 20th century, the family moved to Bexleyheath, Kent, to a small house named Grasmere, designed by Winmill himself. Then in 1904 they moved to nearby Nelson House, 114 Broadway, Bexleyheath, where he had previously lived for five years with his mother. In the mid to late 1920s he was back in Blackheath, where he had lived in his early apprenticeship days - his address was 2 Eliot Place, with a view across the heath, in a building described by his daughter as a \\"tall, gaunt, haunted old house\\" which had previously served as a boarding school, St Piran's, with at least one famous former pupil, Benjamin Disraeli, who studied there for about five years in the 1810s. During these years in Blackheath, Winmill and his daughter took part in local folk dancing and country dancing activities, going to weekly classes in Greenwich for about two years; they also went to parties organised by the Blackheath Music Society. One folk dancing party had 250-300 people taking part. In 1923 the family of three attended an English Folk Dance Society summer school at Aldeburgh, Suffolk (as non-dancing students); activities included the singing of traditional songs, sea shanties, carols, lectures by the folklorist and song collector Cecil Sharp, dance parties at Alde House, as well as demonstrations of sword, morris and country dancing. At Easter 1930 Winmill began renting a furnished labourer's cottage, dating back to the 1730s, at Church End, Henham, Essex, his mother's home village. Soon afterwards he bought the cottage and the one next door for holiday use, making visits there at Easter, Whitsun, summer and autumn for the next 10 years, before eventually living there permanently from 1942 onwards. In the autumn of 1930 he left Blackheath, and moved to Rochester, Kent, to a small Queen Anne house, at 1 Minor Canon Row, in the cathedral precinct (the link with Rochester came through his SPAB work). His life in Rochester was peaceful, giving him time for gardening and meeting old friends, for example at the Art Workers' Guild in London. He organised meetings and trips for the Guild, including a visit to his own house in Rochester, in June 1939, focusing on the furniture and other craftwork. With the advent of the Second World War, things inevitably began to change. In anticipation of aerial bombing, ARP preparations were already being made in 1938. During the early stages of the war, Winmill alternated between Rochester and Henham, but it became necessary to leave Rochester completely in September 1942, a sad time for him, as he loved the house there, and he went to live permanently at Henham. Winmill lost both of his brothers at an early age: William, an accountant, died in August 1921, and Hallett, a mining engineer, died on 11 December 1938. Winmill felt isolated at Henham in his last years, made worse by wartime conditions, and he complained of having 'no work to do', with a lot of his personal things, including books, held in storage. He kept himself occupied with gardening (vegetables and apple trees) and carpentry, went for bicycle rides along the country lanes, and kept up correspondence with friends. He made a few visits to the City of London, once in the spring of 1941 and about three times in 1942. He was saddened to see all the wartime bomb damage in the area around St Paul's Cathedral, Cheapside and Liverpool Street. He felt overawed by the sight of the Cathedral from Newgate Street. In April 1942 he was writing about what he had seen in letters to friends, saying that he would wish to rebuild London according to the ideas in William Morris's book, News from Nowhere, with more open space around St Paul's, rather than having all the damaged City churches rebuilt. In his own village of Henham, he was disturbed by the noise of bombers overhead at night, in March 1944 bombs narrowly missed Henham, and later that year he was upset to see extensive damage to the village caused by a flying bomb. Further sadness came when he heard of the death of the artist Sir George Clausen in November 1944, remembering how much he had learned from him in his early days about painting and pictures. After a short illness and an operation, Winmill died in hospital on 11 January 1945. He was buried on 15 January at the church of St Mary the Virgin, Henham; the funeral address was given by Walter Browne (1885-1959), Archdeacon of Rochester, who referred to Winmill's art and craftsmanship, the influence of John Ruskin and William Morris, his preference for simplicity of style, the high standards he set in his work, his perfectionism, reverence, and love of beauty. According to the Chelmsford Chronicle of 4 May 1945, Winmill left £14,171 in his will. His wife Anne lived on for another 11 years, dying on 15 September 1956. His daughter Joyce wrote a biography of her father which was published in the year after his death; she continued living in the family cottage in Church End, Henham, and became a local historian and speaker on a range of subjects. Joyce Winmill describes her father as a religious man, good with children, kind, gentle, but also quick tempered, followed by penitence and apology. He loved beautiful things, always wore Liberty silk ties, and enjoyed reading the poetry of William Morris and Christina Rossetti. He was a man of habit and routine who went to the same tailor in the City of London for over 50 years, he was a tidy person, a keeper of detailed accounts, and he lived by the motto of 'no short cuts'.

It is in Arts and Crafts style to a design by the architect Charles Canning Winmill and was officially opened in 1928. The building has been used by numerous groups over the years, and was a British Restaurant during and after World War II. Since December 1988 it has been the business premises of the Mary Evans Picture Library, a company founded by Mary Evans and her husband Hilary Evans in 1964.  History =The site pre-1928 The site is in a prominent, elevated position in Blackheath village on the south-western edge of Blackheath Common. Today it is at the junction of Tranquil Vale, Southvale Road and Camden Row. From around 1779, the site was occupied by a mansion, Camden House, later better known as Rashleigh's House, occupied by Thomas Rashleigh (1749—13 September 1833), an attorney with family connections in Cornwall — his older brother was William Rashleigh (MP for Fowey). In 1837, this building was replaced by a group of six shops, numbered 1–6 Camden Place (51–61 Tranquil Vale). During World War I, on 24 August 1916, the site was hit overnight by a bomb from a German Zeppelin airship, which extensively damaged all six shops and two adjacent houses (1 and 3 Southvale Road). The damaged buildings were later demolished, and the site stood unused for several years. The two Southvale Road houses were replaced by a pair of houses named Southvale Mansions in around 1925–1926. Planning and construction In 1923 it was proposed that All Saints' Church should build a parish hall, as there was no separate building where parishioners could meet. On 21 November 1924 the church's parish hall committee discussed employing Charles Canning Winmill (1865–1945), who had recently retired from the London County Council in order to pursue private work after 31 years of service in the architects' department, where he was responsible for social housing and fire stations. He lived locally at 2 Eliot Place, Blackheath, and attended the church. In 1926 William Legge, 6th Earl of Dartmouth (1851–1936), owner of the land, donated it to the church for the building of the hall; around the same time an anonymous donor promised £350 “to buy out the lease”, and a subscription list was opened to raise money for building costs. On All Saints' Day (1 November) 1927 a service of dedication was held on the site, and in December 1927 work began on clearing the wartime debris. Construction work was delayed for six weeks in January and February 1928 due to excessively frosty weather, but then continued, with fundraising continuing in parallel. On 14 March 1928 the Foundation Stone was laid by the Earl of Dartmouth, donor of the site. Architectural style Side view, showing rectangular leaded windows in sets of four, with dormer window at roof level Winmill was strongly influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, led by William Morris and the architects Philip Webb, Richard Lethaby and Charles Voysey. The building is unique, with some typical Arts and Crafts features, including leaded rectangular windows in groups of three or four, with deep windowsills on the interior and carefully designed metal window catches, three circular leaded windows on either side of the entrance door (one on the left, two on the right), dormer windows at roof level, and decorative mosaic-style design work on the front façade. Located in a conservation area, the Lewisham Council local listing describes the hall as follows: > Former parish hall. Detached. 1927-8. By Charles Canning Winmill. Brick in > Flemish bond with stone dressings and plain clay tiles. Between one and two- > and-a-half storeys. Pitched roofs. Flat arched windows. Oculus windows to > one-storey element. Leaded lights. One storey entrance porch has double > doors in pointed arch doorway in chamfered stone surround beneath dentil > eaves. Principal gable (surmounting three storey element) has central flat > arched rectangular window. Gable has diamond pattern red clay and rough-cast > render. This set into deep pointed-arch reveal edged with roundel/flower > motif. Reveal springs from brick corbelling. Opening in 1928 On 29 September 1928 the parish hall was blessed by the Bishop of Woolwich, Dr William Hough (1859–1934), with a dance in the evening with 200 people and music supplied by the Granville Orchestra. On 3 November 1928 the hall was formally opened by Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig- Holstein (1872–1956), granddaughter of Queen Victoria. A Christmas event was also held, with the singing of carols, a decorated tree and Bethlehem tableaux.The Kentish Mercury, 5 October 1928, 2 November 1928, 9 November 1928, 28 December 1928. The four downstairs rooms (known as clubrooms) were named after patron saints, and the colour scheme was cream and brown, with blue curtains on the stage. The fundraising for the building was completed on May Day 1930, with the vicar sitting from 9am to 7pm to receive the final donations, which totalled £1,500. Parish hall use, 1928–1988 From 1928 onwards the building was used for All Saints' Church activities such as Parochial Church Council meetings, two separate youth clubs for 'men and girls', and fundraising events. From 1929 onwards pupils from the church's own primary school (All Saints' Infant School, located at the time in nearby Tranquil Passage) were taken to the hall for routine medical inspections, 'drill' activities and dancing lessons. Records also show that from June to September 1932, during essential roof repairs to the church building, all church services were held in the hall. From the late 1930s the hall was used as an overflow location for All Saints' Infant School. The hall hosted an Autumn Market to raise money for the church in November 1936,Programme, Autumn Market, 20–21 November 1936. and on 18 January 1937 a public meeting held in the hall about controversial local building issues was attended by more than 100 people, leading to the formation of the Blackheath Society, a local conservation society which is still in existence.Round leaded window looking out onto Blackheath CommonAfter World War II began, the hall was formally requisitioned in 1940 by the London County Council to be used as a British Restaurant, designed to provide low-cost hot lunchtime meals to local residents and workers; after the war it served as a 'civic restaurant', and continued under LCC control until 1955. The hall was then handed back to the church and, after some redecoration, rooms were let to various community groups. For example, the Greenwich & Lewisham Antiquarian Society held an exhibition in November 1955,Greenwich & Lewisham Antiquarian Society, Catalogue, Jubilee Exhibition, 12–19 November 1955. and the Blackheath Society held an exhibition in March 1959.The Blackheath Society, Catalogue of an exhibition illustrating Blackheath past and present, March 1959. Some regular uses included a maternity and child welfare clinic (operating through to the 1970s), the Sallie Lewis dancing school, badminton sessions, and a Montessori School. Mary Evans Picture Library, 1988–present In 1988 the parish hall was judged by the Diocese of Southwark to be surplus to requirements, and a suitable organisation was sought to take on the tenancy. In due course the entire building was let to the Mary Evans Picture Library, which had been working in a smaller office building next to Blackheath railway station and needed to expand. The move took place over the Christmas/New Year holidays of 1988/1989, and the company is still in residence today. In September 2016 and again in September 2017 Mary Evans staff members took part in Open House London events, giving visitors guided tours of the building and telling them about its history.

It was formed in response to President Abraham Lincoln's August 1862 call for 300,000 men to serve for nine months. Several months after completing their first term of service, the battery was reorganized for a second term of three years (though the war ended before they could complete this term). It was recruited by Captain Edward J. Jones of Boston and consisted almost entirely of men from that city. The battery served a largely uneventful first term as garrison troops mostly in Centreville, Virginia. During their second term they were involved in heavy combat being part of the Army of the Potomac during Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign. First term of service The 11th Massachusetts Battery trained for their nine-month term of service at Camp Meigs in Readville, Massachusetts in August 1862. The unit was mustered into federal service on August 25. It was the only Massachusetts unit of artillery mustered in under the nine-months call, the other 18 Massachusetts nine-months units being infantry regiments. The men were recruited in Boston and mostly came from that city and the immediate vicinity. The unit left Boston by train on October 3, 1862 and reported to Washington, D.C. on October 6. For their first two months of service, they served garrison duty as part of the defenses of Washington at Camp Barry and later at Hall's Hill in Arlington, Virginia. On November 28 they were transferred to the brigade commanded by Francis Randall garrisoned in Centreville, Virginia. During the winter and early spring of 1864, the unit was frequently used as cavalry, conducting picket and reconnaissance duty between Centreville and Union Mills, Virginia. In April the battery was transferred to the brigade commanded by Daniel Sickles and conducted garrison duty at Fort Ramsay in Arlington County, Virginia and Fort Buffalo, Virginia, both part of the defenses of Washington. At the close of their term of service, the unit departed Washington on May 23, 1863 and arrived in Boston on May 28. They were mustered out on May 29. The unit did not have any men killed in action or by disease during its first term. Second term of service The battery was reorganized during December 1863 to serve a new term of three years. Reenlisted members of the 11th Massachusetts Battery formed the core of the new iteration. They were joined by new recruits to fill out the ranks. Capt. Edward Jones again served as commanding officer. The members of the battery were mustered in on January 2, 1864, trained at Camp Meigs, and departed Massachusetts on February 5. Reaching Washington, the battery was attached to the Second Division (commanded by Major General Robert B. Potter) of the IX Corps, assigned to the Army of the Potomac. The battery took part in the major battles of the Overland Campaign, though they were not heavily engaged until moved to the front lines on June 19 during the start of the Siege of Petersburg. On August 21 and 22, the battery took part in the Battle of Weldon Railroad while temporarily attached to the II Corps. The battery was in action at various points on the siege line at Petersburg during the fall and winter. On March 25, 1865, the battery played an important role during the Battle of Fort Stedman. As Confederate troops overtook Fort Stedman and temporarily broke through Union siege lines, the 11th Massachusetts Battery, posted in nearby Fort Friend, rendered key service in pushing back the assault. When the Confederates abandoned Petersburg and retreated towards Appomattox Court House, the 11th Massachusetts Battery joined other elements of the Army of the Potomac in pursuit. They were present for the surrender at Appomattox and were detailed with other artillery units to take charge of surrendered Confederate cannons. Mustering out The 11th Massachusetts Battery took part in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington after the close of the war. In June they were ordered home to Boston and were mustered out at Camp Meigs on June 16, 1865. The battery lost three men killed in action and twelve by disease.

The name refers to the fact that they were often too poor to even purchase a train ticket to a port city. Roughly 60,000 Jews left the country during that time period, going to Austria and Germany and then onwards via port cities to Canada and the United States. The number of specifically fusgeyer emigrants may be lower, perhaps a few thousand. History See: History of the Jews in Romania The 1866 Constitution of Romania barred citizenship for non-Christians, meaning that most Jews in the country lived with severely reduced rights. Various attempts at mass Jewish emigration happened between that year and 1900, often in the face of resistance from the Romanian government After a famine in 1899, and outbreaks of antisemitic violence, many young Romanian Jews developed a new practice of emigration: banding into disciplined groups which would share resources and leave the country together. The first such group was created in May 1899 in Bârlad. A man named Ginsburg recruited 94 people who started calling themselves the 'Wayfarers from Bârlad'. This group was the inspiration for a number of other groups from other cities, which either named themselves after their city, the name of their occupation, or by a romantic name such as One Heart or The Wandering Jew. After they reached the Austro-Hungarian border they were often provided funds for rail passage by charitable Jewish organizations. Literary Representation Many of the current-day articles about the fusgeyers cite Jill Culiner's 2004 book Finding Home: In the Footsteps of the Jewish Fusgeyers for most of their factual information. Her book in turn was inspired by the Yiddish language memoir of one of the original fusgeyers, Jacob Finkelstein's “Zikhroynes fun a fusgeyer fun rumania kayn amerika,” which won a contest by YIVO in 1945 and was printed in their journal, YIVO Bleter.

He is best known for his social and political doctrines conferred in Lebanon, for the maintenance of peace and social cohesion in a country torn by tensions and intercommoned strife. He has lectured about peace, held interviews on TV, radio, social networks, and newspapers to spread awareness for all the people around, sparing them from risks of civil war and bringing a sense of democracy, awareness, accepting and tolerating each other.Mengès-Le Pape, Christine (2010). L'enseignement des religions: approches laïques et religieuses - Issue 2 of Publications du Centre universitaire de Tarn-et-Garonne. Presses de l'Université des sciences sociales de Toulouse.  The core of his work  The poetry of Mgr. Moubarak is known to have dominant harmony of the classical types of rhymes (end, internal, slant, rich, eyes or identical rhymes). As for the content, Mgr. Moubarak combined French symbolism and German contemplation, making his poetry linked to romanticism. His poetry reflects on faith and calls on the reader to contemplate existence as it is. On the other hand, his socio-political writings are clearly influenced by Jürgen Habermas and Alasdair MacIntyre without denying the principles of liberalism that acknowledge the existence of the individual before the state and the nation. They reflect a clear respect for what the school of Communitarianism stands for, stressing on the need of finding commonalities that bring people together for an acceptable and peaceful coexistence among minorities; especially after the massive migrations, for Mfr. Moubarak, the societies currently has no longer a single cultural face. He confirms that these common denominators do not contradict the charter of human rights, but they consist of other foundations such as: respect of motherhood, uplifting of the disenfranchised, importance of child care, and safety of the environment. The aim he often exposes is to avoid all the causes of cultural conflicts that might lead to military stages. His reform-oriented ideas are in phase with those of the two Canadian Will Kymlicka and Charles Taylor. Mgr. Moubarak is in favor of implementing the federal system in Lebanon. He endorses that the federal system can resolve the problem of sectarianism just like it has resolved the problem of cultural diversity throughout the world. Moreover, he assures that individuals’ dignity is the same, regardless of their community because they are, above all, human beings. As to the recognition of differences advocated by community members, it does not emanate from individuals as individuals, but from their place in society. This is where the obligation of respecting ethnic groups as communities not as individuals comes from. In this sense, the solution to the problems of minorities is based on the balance of respect; each solution that does not respect the balance between the collective identity and the individual’s will create an “amorphous” culture, which is dependent, unintentionally, on discrimination, if not racism. As to the liberal perspective, whether it is traditional or innovative, is based, for Mgr. Moubarak, on an atomist conception of society, as a collectivity of free and rational individuals. Those are supposed to act as disengaged, exempt of any prior determination, being social or cultural, and likely to willingly choose the ends and values that guide their actions. They are surrounded by a veil of ignorance as to their origins, their places in society. He theorizes that an individual should not distance himself from the goals of his own community, since common goals play a crucial part in the construction of the individual personality and give sense to every individual action. As a result, the constituent attachment of every human being to the values of his ethnic group necessitates recognition of collective rights.  Teaching Career  Mgr. Camille Moubarak started his educational journey at the Protestant Institute in Beirut, and the Lebanese League School, College Notre-Dame de Jamhour (Jesuits school), to end at La Sagesse Brasilia in Beirut. From a school teacher to a college professor at the Institute of Theology - University of St. Joseph (Jesuits order), and at La Sagesse University, Mgr. Moubarak taught anthropology, ethics, multiculturalism and political science. Topics already treated in many of his books to be mentioned later on. He became the administrator of La Sagesse School in Beirut in 1987 (1987-1997),Revue du Liban et de l'Orient arabe, Issues 1756-1768, 1993 then La Sagesse School of Jdeideh, Metn, in 1997 (1997-1999), to end up as the President of Sagesse University between 2011 and 2015, as he served previously as Dean of the Faculty of Political Science and International Relations for fifteen years. In 2015 he received the Deanship of the Doctoral Institute at Sagesse University. Revolutionary and innovator, he endorsed the shift from traditional educational system to a project-based one.  Priesthood  He was ordained priest on June 9, 1984 and served in a number of Maronite parishes within the archdiocese of Beirut such as Saint Joseph at Ashrafieh, Our Lady at Ain Saadeh, Saint George at Beit Mery, Saint Antony at Jdeideh El Metn and lately Our Lady at Hadath. In all stages of his service, he was active in the pastoral field and the theological and social preaching. He was elevated to the dignity of Chorbishop on October 7, 2012.  Early Life and Education  Mgr. Camille Moubarak son of Moubarak Moubarak and Zahia Chahine, was born on December 15th, 1947. He used to be homeschooled by his parents until he joined the school of Lebanese Missionaries in Jounieh, Lebanon. After that, he was sent to the public school of Ain Dara and then to the secondary public school of Furn el Chebbak where he finished secondary school with a concentration in philosophy. He later joined the University of St. Joseph of the Jesuits in Beirut, where he majored in Literature and graduated with a PhD. His dissertation was titled \\"Ibn Khaldun's Racial Discrimination.\\" Afterwards, he went for another major in Philosophy and Theology at the Holy Spirit University of Kaslik - Jounieh. Then he went to Rome and joined the Pontifical Lateran University where he deepened his studies in economic, political and reformatory theories, and graduated with a doctorate degree in Social Ecclesial Doctrine. His thesis was titled \\"The Issue of Minorities between Politics and Religion.\\"  Publications  In poetry: *Moubarak, Camille (2000).

A woman with a history of mental health problems, and a victim of police brutality a few years earlier, Reed died while on remand in Holloway prison. It was later found that the denial of medical treatment had led to her death, and that she would not have been able to plead. Personal history A mixed-race black woman, Reed's mental health problems began in 2003 after the sudden death of her baby daughter. Along with the baby's father, she was given the wrapped remains to take to the undertakers in a taxi. In 2012, Reed was the victim of a severe attack from a white police officer PC James Kiddie, and suffered two broken ribs. She had been falsely arrested by Kiddie for suspected shoplifting. Kiddie was prosecuted, and convicted of common assault in 2014. He was dismissed from the Metropolitan Police. The officer had two previous confirmed complaints lodged against him, the second for discriminatory comments made in 2011. While in the psychiatric Maudsley Hospital in 2014, Reed told her family that she was sexually assaulted by an elderly male patient; some reports say this was a case of attempted rape. After reportedly acting in self-defence, she was charged with GBH with intent and held in Holloway prison on remand from October 2015 for psychiatric assessment to determine whether she was able to plead at trial. The report had not been written by the time of her death in January 2016, nor had a letter been sent to ensure her transfer to a more appropriate secure psychiatric facility. Her anti-psychotic drugs were reduced out of other health fears, but nothing was substituted; her health worsened. The staff's monitoring of Reed was reduced from twice to once an hour when she was moved to a different unit; although it was known she had self-harmed in the past, Reed was considered at low-risk. On 11 January 2016, in Holloway prison's medical wing, Reed was found to be unresponsive on her prison bed with strips of linen around her neck. The Ministry of Justice said that CPR was attempted, but she was pronounced dead shortly after she was found. She suffered from bulimia, paranoid schizophrenia, and engaged in alcohol and substance abuse. A vigil was held outside Holloway prison in February 2016 on the day of her funeral. Inquest and related issues The inquest verdict was that Reed had killed herself by self-strangulation. The jury decided she had died when her mind was unsound, but was unable to determine whether her death was intentional. Unacceptable delays in medical care contributed to her death. Holloway prison was closed in May 2016 after being considered inadequate; an official decision which was endorsed by the prison inspectorate whose October 2016 report had criticised the prison's slow transfer of women with mental health issues to secure hospitals. Reed was the last woman to die in Holloway prison; reports of the racist treatment of prisoners dated back to the 1980s. Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, in an article for The Guardian about this case, said the custodial remand of women in the United Kingdom is \\"scandalously high\\"; 70% of the women so held do not receive a custodial sentence after their trial.

He led the divided Peshischa community for a year, until his death in 1828.  Biography  Probably born in Przysucha around 1800, in his early years he studied under his father, later marrying Braindel Faiga the maternal granddaughter of Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz. Nearing the end of his father's life, his father would often praise Avraham Moshe stating that \\"his soul originated in a supreme place\\". Although Avraham Moshe had a complicated and tenuous relationship with his father, going as far as to not attend his fathers funeral. Nevertheless after his fathers death, the less radical of his father's pupils such as Israel Yitzhak Kalish, supported the succession of Avraham Moshe, while the more radical of his fathers followers supported Menachem Mendel of Kotzk. At first, Avraham Moshe refused the position to avoid a schism in the community, but after much pressure from his father's followers he agreed. Ultimately after Avraham Moshe's short year as the Peshischa Rebbe, the leadership fell into the hands of Menachem Mendel of Kotzk, after his death in 1859, Peshischa ceased to exist as a separate movement, yet it's ideals still exist as the foundation for a large percentage of modern Hasidic groups.Yitzhak Alfasi, Encyclopedia of Hasidic Personalities.

Norman is an astronomer and the Deputy Director of the Community Science and Data Center at the National Science Foundation's National Optical- Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab) in Tucson, Arizona. She is also the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy Diversity Advocate at NOAO. Her research centers on the influence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on the evolution of galaxies. In 2020, she was inducted into the inaugural cohort of American Astronomical Society Fellows in recognition of her leadership and achievements.  Education and early career  Norman grew up on the south side of Chicago, Illinois where she developed a love of astronomy, influenced by her mother, who was a fan of science fiction and the United States Space program. As a child, she wanted to grow up to be an astronomer before attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There, she studied under the mentorship of James Elliott, who was known for his leadership of the team that discovered Uranus's rings. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in 1988 in Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Science. After completing her undergraduate studies, Norman worked at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center for three years. While presenting her research at the 1992 American Astronomical Society meeting, she met Bruce Margon, the chairman of the University of Washington's Astronomy department where she had recently applied to attend graduate school. The two had recently observed the same active galaxy using the Hubble Space Telescope, which they discussed during Norman's poster presentation. Norman was ultimately admitted to the University's graduate program and began in the Fall of 1992.Norman received her Doctorate degree in 1999, becoming the first African American woman to earn her Ph.D. in astronomy at the university. During her doctoral work, she specialized in gravitational lensing studied quasars. Following her doctoral work, she became a National Science Foundation Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow, working at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) with the Deep Lens Survey team. In that role, she worked to understand how observed galaxies are magnified by gravitational lensing and how this so- called \\"magnification bias\\" affects our view of the universe.  Career = Research  Norman is now an associate scientist and the Deputy Director of the Community Science and Data Center (CSDC) at the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab), which operates NOAO as of October 1, 2019. Her research interests have evolved to focus on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), which are compact regions at the center of galaxies that are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes. AGN, which can be more luminous than an entire galaxy of stars, form as stars and gases are accreted through the activity of a supermassive black hole. Norman's research seeks to understand how these active galaxies form and why some of them are brighter than others.  Diversity, equity, and inclusion work  Norman is recognized as a leader in diversity, equity, and inclusion, serving as the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy Diversity Advocate at NOAO. In this role, she works on establishing and implementing recruitment and retention initiatives for minorities and women in astronomy. She also serves as a member of the American Astronomical Society's Committee on the Status of Minorities in Astronomy. She has served as an expert panelist in a number of National Academy of Sciences studies, which have culminated in the Academies' 2013 report on advancing women of color in academia and a 2018 report on sexual harassment in the sciences. Her advocacy efforts around inclusion focus on two areas of access: (1) access to sitting on advisory committees and leadership boards, ensuring that these groups are representative of the communities they seek to serve, and (2) access to large datasets, ensuring that the requisite training and infrastructure is available. In order to address the latter, she and her colleagues have advocated for making coding and development training widely available across the astronomy and astrophysics workforce, regardless of academic affiliation or career stage. She has noted that data access is becoming a prerequisite for telescope access, which is an essential component in advancing astronomers' research and careers.

In 1913 Laddey attended the International Women's Suffrage Congress in Budapest. In 1920 she was a founding member of the New Jersey state chapter of the League of Women Voters. In 1931 and 1932, she was finance chair of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), and in this capacity toured in the western United States, lecturing with Katherine Devereux Blake.  Personal life  Schlee married Victor H. G. Laddey in 1876. They had three children, John, Eric, and Paula, before they family moved to the United States in 1888. Paula Laddey became a lawyer and clubwoman in New Jersey. Victor Laddey died in 1929; Clara Schlee Laddey died in 1932, aged 76 years, in Alton, New Hampshire.

Timeline=January 2020 * 27 January – the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) for COVID-19 was created to co-ordinate the national response to the pandemic. February 2020 * 5 February – the Coronavirus Expert Advisory Group—a subgroup of NPHET chaired by Dr Cillian de Gascun, the UCD-based Director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory – met for the first time in Dublin. * 29 February **The first confirmed case in the Republic of Ireland was announced involving a male student from the east of the country, who had arrived there from Northern Italy. Ireland subsequently entered the Containment Phase. **Authorities shut a secondary school linked to the case as a precautionary measure. The State did not name the school involved, but—shortly afterwards—the Irish Examiner's Political Editor, Daniel McConnell, tweeted a copy of the letter it had sent to parents informing them it would close. March 2020 * 3 March – a second case was confirmed of a female in the east of the country who had been to Northern Italy. She had no contact with the first case. * 4 March – four more cases were confirmed, two females and two males in the west of the country who travelled from Northern Italy, bringing the total to six. * 5 March – seven more cases were confirmed, bringing the total to 13. Four of the cases were related to travel from Northern Italy—four males from the east of the country—one of these four cases was connected to Trinity College Dublin. Two of the seven cases were associated with close contact with a confirmed case—two females in the west of the country. One of the seven cases was a male in the south of the country who had no history of travel abroad. * 6 March **It was reported that more than 60 staff at Cork University Hospital would have to self-isolate following a case of community transmission of COVID-19 at the hospital. **The same day brought confirmation of five more cases, bringing the total in the country at that time to 18. * 7 March – one more case was confirmed bringing the total to 19. * 8 March – two more cases were confirmed bringing the total to 21. * 9 March – three more cases were confirmed bringing the total to 24. * 10 March – ten more cases were confirmed bringing the total to 34. * 11 March **An elderly patient in Naas General Hospital in County Kildare (south-west of the country's capital city, Dublin) became Ireland's first fatality from the virus; nine new cases were announced. This brought confirmed cases to 43. **Cork University Hospital discharged a patient who had been admitted for coronavirus disease after they made a full recovery. * 12 March **27 new cases were confirmed, bringing the total cases in the country to 70. **In response to the increase of cases, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the closure of all schools, colleges and childcare facilities until 29 March. The announcement, which came one day after the World Health Organization formally declared that the outbreak was pandemic, also marked Ireland's movement from the Containment Phase in its strategy to combat the spread of the virus (a strategy which the Department of the Taoiseach had reaffirmed just three days earlier) towards the Delay Phase. * 13 March – 20 new cases were confirmed, bringing the total cases in the country to 90. * 14 March – 39 new cases were confirmed and another death announced of a man in the East of the country with underlying medical conditions. This brought the total cases to 129, with 2 deaths in total. * 15 March **40 new cases were confirmed. The total number of cases stood at 169 with 2 deaths. **University Hospital Limerick discharged four patients. **The Government of Ireland ordered bars and public houses to close and advised against house parties. * 16 March – 54 new cases were confirmed.

It showed that the virus was present in 23 of the 26 counties, with Laois, Leitrim and Monaghan the only three yet to record a case. * 19 March – 191 new cases were confirmed, bringing total to 557. 1 new death was recorded, bringing the total to 3 deaths. The woman died in an isolation ward in St Vincent's Hospital. Her daughter later spoke to the media and urged the public to protect themselves from the virus. * 20 March – 126 new cases were reported, bringing the total to 683. It was also confirmed that the virus had since infected Laois and Leitrim, leaving Monaghan as the last of the 26 counties. * 21 March – 102 new cases were reported, bringing the total to 785. * 22 March **121 new cases were announced, bringing the total to 906.

Among the deaths was the country's first healthcare fatality, who was based in the east. **Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced a national stay-at-home order with a series of measures which he summed up as: \\"Stay at Home\\" (subject to certain exemptions). **Merrion Street described it as \\"a more intensive phase in our response to COVID-19\\". The measures, which coincided with an escalating death toll, were also a response to increased reliance on intensive care units (ICUs) to treat critically ill patients, and an attempt to lower this number before capacity was reached. * 28 March – 294 new cases, as well as 14 new deaths, brought the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 2,415 and 36, respectively. * 29 March – 200 cases and 10 deaths were reported, bringing the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 2,615 and 46, respectively. * 30 March – 295 cases and 8 deaths were reported, bringing the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 2,910 and 54, respectively. * 31 March – 325 cases and 17 deaths were reported, bringing the total number of confirmed cases and deaths to 3,235 and 71, respectively.

From here, the line parallels GO Transit's Kitchener line for about until diverging north. Just after crossing into York, the railway crosses under Canadian National's Halton subdivision. Here the line passes just east of CPR's Vaughan Intermodal facility. Following three sidings at Bolton, Palgrave and Ypres, the railway junctions with the Barrie Collingwood Railway, which runs east to Barrie. Following this junction, the route winds its way through northern Simcoe County until entering the dense forests of northern Ontario.

He was a constant defender of the historical and artistic Mexican heritage, mainly from his hometown, of which he was chronicler, an appointment that was originally in charge of the Presidency and to which he resigned to propose the creation of the Council of the Chronicle of the City of Mexico. He was a specialist in the New Spain/Mexican colonial period art, history and literature. He published several books about Colonial Mexican art and collaborated, among others, for the newspaper La Jornada. He stood out for his early intelligence: he learned to read long before entering school, and at age 13 he was advisor to colonial art of the then president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. At 23, he published his first book, Renaissance painting and sculpture in Mexico. He was a member of the Historical Center Executive Committee, corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, in Madrid, and honorary member of the Hispanic Society of America, the latter based in New York City.Castaños y Cañedo, FJ (2005).

The scholarly comments of Guillermo Tovar de Teresa at the age of 11 with the then Mexican President, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, about the fire in a structure and his criticism of restoration made him deserving of the official appointment of Counselor in Colonial Art, with a payment of a centenary. He learned to appreciate history and art books from a very young age, thanks to his grandfather, Guillermo de Teresa y Teresa, and his father, Dr. Rafael Tovar y Villa Gordoa, his \\"guardian figures\\". He said, that his grandfather had taught him to read in the pages of the newspaper... Self-taught by choice (I decided to train on my own (...) I was bored), lived away from universities. At the age of seven he received, from then President Adolfo López Mateos, \\"a medal in recognition of his dedication to the study of Mexican history and art.\\" At age 11 he was invited by the historian Jorge Gurría Lacroix to collaborate in the National Institute of Anthropology and History. At age 12 he was appointed advisor to President Díaz Ordaz in matters of colonial art. At 14, he had already given his first lectures at the Institute of Aesthetic Research of the UNAM, and at a very young age he received a distinction from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid. At 16 he concluded his formal investigation into the history of Tacubaya, years later published as Historical news of the Miguel Hidalgo Delegation.  Genealogy  Portrait of Guillermo Tovar de Teresa in his childhood, in the museum Guillermo Tovar de Teresa House (Valladolid 52, Colonia Roma, Mexico City). He was interested in investigating all the branches of his ancestry, passing through some of the largest and oldest families in the New Spain. In 2012, he submitted a request to succeed in the title of count of Gustarredondo, which litigated in Spain asking rights of possession. On the death of Guillermo Tovar, his nephew, Rafael Tovar y López-Portillo, son of Rafael Tovar y Teresa, director of Conaculta and grandson of the president José López-Portillo, requested the subrogation of the rights of his uncle in that title, because he is the firstborn. Guillermo Tovar was a great-grandson of Margarita López-Portillo y Rojas, in turn the sister of the lawyer, governor of the state of Jalisco, novelist, poet, playwright, journalist and language scholar José López Portillo y Rojas. Guillermo Tovar was also the maternal nephew of the writer José Bernardo Couto and maternal great-great-grandson of the writer José Joaquín Pesado.Castaños y Cañedo, FJ (2005) .

He only boxed for three years but became the most popular boxer in the colonies due to his grit and determination during his short career. He began his boxing career in New Zealand but moved to Australia after a year where he achieved popularity and became the middleweight champion of Australia after beating Mick Dunn. He then went to America where he suffered his first defeat and returned to Australia, accusing his manager of taking advantage of him financially. Shortly after returning he suffered his second defeat in a rematch with Dunn and passed away shortly afterwards due to a concussion. Biography=Early Years Cribb was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1878. His birth name was Alfred Simpson and his father was a tobacconist and hairdresser in Christchurch. He also became a tobacconist and worked for a chemist's shop in New Zealand for a time, and attained a high level of education. Cribb began boxing in New Zealand in 1898 winning several fights that year, and came to Australia in about 1899, ultimately settling in Parramatta, and earned recognition in boxing circles by sparring in a novice tournament at the Alhambra Club in Sydney in May. He joined the novice competition officially and in June 1899 he fought a fellow novice boxer Paddy Martin at the Alhambra Club and won. The fight was regarded as both entertaining and amusing by the crowd, with Otto drawing laughs for reacting to being punched in the nose by wiping it. In September he beat Joe Dunn in a semi-final of the novice competition, and in October he drew against a boxer going by the pseudonym 'The Poet'. In late October he contracted influenza and was bedridden for four days leading him to postpone a match against Jack Tuckwell, who he beat when the match finally took place in late November. In December he acted as a cornerman for the first time during a Colonial Fleet boxing championship. Boxing stardom in Australia Otto Cribb, 1900. In January 1900 Cribb beat Harry Dawson in five minutes in a fight at the Golden Gate Club attended by 800 spectators, who were disappointed at the noncompetitive fight. After the fight he expressed the wish to box in Melbourne, but in February he boxed in Sydney again against Ned Burden at the Golden Gate club winning quickly in front of a crowd of 1,000. In March he fought Victorian light-weight Tot Higgins in Sydney, and won in thirteen rounds in what was described as his best performance yet in front of a crowd of 2,000. In April he beat Jack Broughton at the Gaiety Theatre in front of 500 people and the match was harshly criticized due to Broughton's lack of competitiveness, and it was suggested it may even kill the Sydney boxing boom. In late April 1900 Cribb made up for the lacklustre match against Broughton by fighting Queenslander Snowy Sturgeon in front of 1,500 people knocking Sturgeon out in what was described as one of the most exciting fights ever held in Sydney. In early May he briefly visited Melbourne and was present in boxing circles, stating that while he was in Melbourne for a holiday he would box if an opponent presented themselves. After returning to Sydney he fought a rematch against Snowy Sturgeon in front of a crowd which filled the Metropolitan Athletic Club Hall over capacity with over 1,500 spectators filling the hall and crowding the doors. The majority of the crowd supported Cribb and he knocked Sturgeon down to win the fight in the eighth round. Cribb was regarded as a star after the Sturgeon fights and was scheduled to face Victorian boxer Peter Murphy, but refused to fight in Melbourne while Murphy refused to fight in Sydney which prompted an offer from Brisbane to host the fight, which ultimately did not take place. Instead Cribb boxed Sturgeon a third time in July in Sydney and they attracted a crowd of 1,400. The fight was regarded as disappointing with neither boxer being aggressive and it went the full twenty rounds. The referee expressed that they felt Cribb had been superior, but prior to the fight it had been agreed that going the distance meant the result was a draw. In early September he fought Tot Higgins again and won in four minutes, and later in the month he was scheduled to box Mick Dunn for the Australian middleweight championship. He fought Dunn in October to a capacity crowd of approximately 1,500 at the Gaiety Athletic Club and the fight was regarded as exciting with Dunn knocking Cribb's false teeth out of his mouth with a lefthanded punch, and Cribb knocking Dunn out in the eighth round to secure the championship. Trip to America Otto Cribb, illustration from 1901. In October 1900 Otto's brother Arthur made his boxing debut in Sydney but lost with critics stating he did not have his brothers fighting abilities beyond grit. Otto himself spent some of October in Melbourne and then embarked on a trip to America immediately after arriving back in Sydney, disappointing Mick Dunn who he had promised a rematch after his Melbourne trip. It was reported he intended to pursue a boxing career in the United States largely due to being frustrated by booking negotiations in Australia. Cribb sailed to America on the Maripose and by December 1900 he had settled in San Francisco. He came under the wing of a boxing promoter named Mr. James and boxed in a trial against Soldier Green to impress him, earning a booking against Frank McConnell. The booking was regarded as somewhat controversial as Cribb was completely unknown in America and his undefeated record in Australia had not been used to promote him to American boxing fans. Cribb beat McConnell in four rounds when the fight took place in January 1901, and was reportedly immediately well known in San Francisco as a result. In February he fought Charlie Thurston, the Flying Dutchman, and the match went the whole twenty rounds and ended in a draw. Cribb's match with Thurston was positively received and a rematch was organized, with some haggling over the price, and Cribb employed a large team of trainers to assist him in preparing for the rematch, prompting Thurston to remark \\"I guess they can't get inside the ring and help Cribb, so I don't care if he has a dozen Australians training him.\\" They fought to a crowd of 7,000 at the end of March, and Cribb was accused of fouling with low blows early in the match, which was ignored by the referee. He tired by the end of the match, but did manage a late comeback and avoided being knocked out however Thurston was awarded the win without controversy. Return to Australia In May 1901 Cribb embarked on a return voyage for Australia due to feeling homesick, and he arrived in Sydney on the R.M.S. Sierra in June. When asked about America upon his arrival he remarked that \\"America is all right, but no more Americans for me; I'll tell you all some other time.\\" In an interview after settling in he remarked that his contract had severely limited his opportunities and he felt his manager had taken advantage of him financially and had threatened to prevent him from returning to Australia when he expressed dissatisfaction. He also reported that when he attended a fight as a spectator someone pulled a knife on him causing him to pull a gun on them, which resulted in him being assaulted by several people at the next match prompting him to run away. He expressed his desire to box again after settling in and announced he would honor his promise and give Mick Dunn a rematch as his first fight. Dunn was eager to have his rematch and approached Cribb to organize it immediately after hearing of his return. In early June 1901 Cribb sparred with Donny Maloney. He gave another interview in early June in which expressed his desire to fight everybody in his weight class before going on a business trip to New Zealand in September, which prompted Dunn to question if this meant Cribb intended to renege on their rematch again, however he was reassured when the rematch was confirmed shortly afterwards. In July a rematch with Snowy Sturgeon was organized to take place after the Dunn rematch, and New Zealand boxer Jerry Butler challenged Cribb to a match. Death Otto Cribb v Mick Dunn at the Gaiety Hall, Sydney, July 1901 Cribb faced Dunn on 22 July 1901 and suffered a violet defeat with Dunn knocking him out in the ninth round with a blow to the forehead and an uppercut to the jaw. Cribb appeared fine after the fight other than a cut to the cheek and shook hands with Dunn, however he died in his sleep on 23 July 1901. His trainer had advised him against continuing with the fight as shortly beforehand he had complained of severe back pain which made it difficult for him to sit, however he refused to postpone the fight or wear a plaster brace for fear of disappointing the public. Dunn noted he had no ill feelings against Cribb and that he had not had any desire to hurt him, and had intended for the fight to be his last, and had only not retired after their previous bout as he felt he performed poorly in it. Cribb's funeral was held on July 25 and attended by many members of the public. He was laid to rest in the Jewish section of a cemetery in Rookwood. It was determined the cause of death was a hemorrhage on the surface of the brain due to a concussion and Mick Dunn, the referee, the timekeeper, Cribb's trainer, and one of his cornermen were all arrested and charged on suspicion of having been involved with his death. While concussion was the cause of death some injuries to internal organs were also discovered. The arrests drew criticism from some who felt that there was no place for police involvement in an athletic contest. On 26 July 1901 the death was officially ruled accidental by an inquest.

Over a 22-season career, he was a five-time champion, four times with the Yomiuri Giants and once with the Samsung Lions. He was a two-time ERA champion of Japan's Central League. A workhorse during much of his career, he had success as both a starter and a reliever. Although born in Japan, Niura is of Korean descent, part of the Zainichi community.  Career = NPB  Niura was born in Japan and attended Shizuoka Shogyo High School,\\"Hisao Niura,\\" BR Bullpen. Retrieved June 22, 2020. but technically held Korean citizenship. As a 17-year-old in the summer of 1968, Niura announced his intention to drop out of high school and turn pro, but as a \\"foreign player\\" was ruled ineligible even though he had attended a Japanese high school. Niura then became the subject of intense bidding in excess of the draft-restricted contract bonus of ¥1,000,000, with six NPB teams and even some Major League Baseball teams involved. As a result, Niura joined the Yomiuri Giants outside of the draft. This became a key case to change the ruling on NPB draft eligibility from \\"those with Japanese citizenship\\" to \\"those that are registered with Japanese schools.\\" Niura made it to the top level of NPB in 1971, and ended up pitching for the Yomiuri Giants for 13 seasons. The Giants won the Japan Series championship each of Niura's first three years in the league (this was during the Giants' record nine straight championships), although he did not pitch in any Series games. Niura's best stretch in NPB was from 1976 to 1979, when he won a total of 52 games, with a winning percentage of .619, with 32 complete games. Niura appeared in 50 games in 1976, half as a starter and half as a reliever. He tied for the league lead in shutouts with three, and finished third in ERA behind Takamasa Suzuki and Shigeru Kobayashi. That year he made his first Central League All-Star team. He finally appeared in a Japan Series game, pitching two innings in Game Two (Yomiuri ended up losing in seven games to the Hankyu Braves). In 1977, his 2.32 ERA was the best in the Central League; his nine saves also were tied for the league lead. Hisao again pitched in the Japan Series (again against the Braves), appearing in Games One, Two, and Four, and taking the loss in the clincher Game Five. Niura won 15 games and saved 15 more in 1978, both career highs; his 63 appearances led the Central League. He repeated as ERA champion with a 2.81 mark, made his second All-Star team, won both Fireman of the Year and Middle Reliever of the Year, and was given a Best Nine Award as the Central League's best pitcher. In 1979 Niura went 15–11 with 5 saves, a 3.43 ERA and 223 strikeouts in 236-1/3 innings, leading the Central League in strikeouts. He made his third All-Star team. Elbow problems in the period 1980 to 1983 reduced his workload.  KBO  Niura transitioned to the Samsung Lions of the nascent KBO League in 1984, playing under his Korean name Kim Il-young. He was 16–10 with a 2.27 ERA in 1984. In 1985 Niura/Kim went 25-6 for the Lions, with a 2.79 ERA and 11 complete games to help lead the Lions to the KBO League championship. (Under the format the league played during that era, because the Lions finished first in both half-seasons, no Korean Series was played and Samsung was declared champion outright.)Young Hoon Lee, Rodney Fort, editors. The Sports Business in The Pacific Rim: Economics and Policy (Springer, Oct 31, 2014) p. 178. Kim won ten games in his first 12 starts that year, a KBO record for the fastest time to ten wins.Baek Byung-yeul. \\"Baseball: Nippert, Jimenez key players to teams' victories,\\" The Korea Times (2016-05-02). Kim's 25 wins that year are still good for third-place in KBO single-season victories; he was beaten out for the 1985 KBO League Golden Glove Award by his teammate Kim Si-jin, who also won 25 games. He continued his KBO success in 1986, going 13–4 with a 2.53 ERA. Niura was diagnosed with diabetes in 1986; that combined with the language barrier (Niura did not speak Korean), led to him returning to Japan. Niura's three years in the KBO resulted in a 54–20 record (a .730 winning percentage), a 2.53 ERA, 32 complete games, and 8 shutouts.  NPB (second stint)  Niura returned to NPB in 1987, having added a screwball and changeup to his pitching repertoire, which previously had been limited to a fastball and a curveball. Now playing for the Yokohama Taiyō Whales, Niura ended up winning 11 games in 1987, along with 7 complete games and 4 shutouts, and won the Comeback Player of the Year Award (an honor he shared with Tōru Sugiura of the Yakult Swallows). He made his fourth All- Star team in 1987 and his fifth (and final) one in 1988. On August 4, 1989, he shut out his old team Yomiuri on 13 hits, the most hits ever allowed by an NPB pitcher in a shutout. Niura's 22-season career ended in 1992, playing with the Yakult Swallows.

Although McAlpine rejected the use of the presence of an anepisternal (=sternopleural) seta, Whittington more recently continued to use it as it provides an additional character besides those given above, all of which are transitional to some extent in the other subfamilies of the Platystomatidae. In particular, head and genitalic morphology, and perhaps larval biology once more of this is known, should play a role in the definition of the subfamilies, the debate for which remains open. Seven of the eleven genera in the Trapherinae are monotypic: Aglaioptera, Eopiara, Phasiamya, Phlyax, Piara, Traphera and Xiriella.  Biology  Little is known of the biology of Trapherinae. Larvae of Poecilotraphera were recorded from guava, sugar cane, rice and maize. Steyskal, G C (1965). The genus Poecilotraphera Hendel (Diptera: Platystomatidae).

The museum is under the artistic direction of Mercedes Vostell and under the general direction of José Antonio Agúndez García.. The Museo Vostell Malpartida was founded by Wolf Vostell and Mercedes Vostell in 1976.  History  In 1976 Wolf Vostell created a sculpture in Los Barruecos with his automobile, a black Opel Admiral from 1970 with which he had travelled with his family through Extremadura. The title of the sculpture is VOAEX (Journey in the Upper Extremadura) and in 1978 he created the sculpture The dead who is thirsty (El Muerto que tiene Sed). The 30th of october 1976 was the inauguration of the VOAEX sculpture and the foundation of the Museo Vostell Malpartida. The floor space of the museum is about 14.000 m². The washhouse was operated in the 18th and 19th centuries; it is an interesting trade in which the wool was washed by the animals of the migratory herds with water from the pond Barruecos de Abajo of Extremadura. The house consists of several rooms in which different activities were carried out: Shearing sheep and weighing. Since 1988 the german Goethe-Institut is collaborating with the museum. The collaboration started when Manuel Heredia (former Head of Technology of the Goethe-Institut Madrid) supported Wolf Vostell in the 1980s in finding the 20 motorcycles of the brand Sanglas for Salvador Dalí's sculpture The end of the Parzival (El fin de Parzival). Since then the Goethe- Institut is part of selected exhibitions, concerts and book releases. In 1994 the government of Extremadura took over the complete renovation of the buildings. After Vostell's death in 1998, Mercedes Vostell became the artistic director of the museum. In 2005 the state government acquired the Vostell- archive for the museum. The Vostell-archive became an integral part of the Museo Vostell Malpartida. It serves art historians, journalists, students and all other people interested in art as a source of information. The Museo Vostell Malpartida had 47,376 visitors in 2016 and was number 10 of 30 must- see museums in Spain, according to the National Geographic Society in Spain 2017. The Museo Vostell Malpartida was awarded the Gold Medal of Merit in the Fine Arts in 2018 by the Spanish Government.  Collections and exhibitions = Structure of the museum  The museum consists primarily of four parts. Three parts are permanent exhibitions from the collection of Wolf and Mercedes Vostell, as well as from the collection of the Italian art collector Gino Di Maggio, who specifically collected the art of the Fluxus artists. The third part contains temporary exhibitions of changing conceptual artists. The museum also includes the outdoor exhibition in the nature reserve Los Barruecos. The outdoor exhibition includes the sculptures VOAEX (1976) and in El muerto que tiene Sed (1978).  Collection Wolf and Mercedes Vostell  The opening collection Wolf and Mercedes Vostell offers an extensive and varied tour through the selection of cycles by the founding artist. It consists of five works, which make up the special reference of this museum: Automobile-Fever (Auto-Fieber) (1973), Fluxus-Buick-Piano (1988), Endogene Depression (1975 - 1978), Requiem for the forgotten (Réquiem por los olvidados) (1986), The Breakfast of Leonardo da Vinci in Berlin (Das Frühstück von Leonardo da Vinci in Berlin) (1998) Wolf Vostell, VOAEX (Journey in the Upper Extremadura), 1976, sculpture in Los Barruecos As objects, most of these parts contain elements of the fetishistic symbolism of the 20th century. To all this belong five sculptures The Concrete Bulls (Los Toros de Hormigón) (1990), four large reliefs (Trashumancia) (1993) and paintings such as The Burial of the Sardine (El Entierro de la Sardina) (1985), The Billard Girls (Las Chicas del Billar) (1986), Mythos Berlin (1987) and Estrella Seelenfreund (1994). In addition, the Wolf and Mercedes Vostell Collection has a large number of paintings like the cycles El muerto que tiene Sed and VOAEX and the sculpture projects Icarus and Tanit, which attempt to offer a comprehensive tour of a selection of the artist's cycles. Also worth mentioning are the works Transmigration III (1958-1959), in which a television set is integrated, and Foreign mountain (Montaña extranjera) (1958), with which Wolf Vostell began his production in Extremadura. In the garden of the museum there is a 16 meter high sculpture by Wolf Vostell with the title Why did the process between Pilate and Jesus take only two minutes? (Por qué el proceso entre Jesús y Pilatos duró solamente dos minutos?) (1996), consisting of the fuselage of a Russian Mig-21 airplane, two automobiles, computer monitors and three pianos.  Fluxus Collection  The Fluxus collection was donated to the museum by the Italian art collector Gino Di Maggio in october 1996. Di Maggio established a personal relationship with the Fluxus artists, took care of their works and exhibited them first in the multipurpose room Multhipla and later in the Mudima Foundation. The donation consists of a series of works, most of which are Fluxus actions and interventions, so that the photographs, videos, manifestos and various texts are the necessary additions to these bundles of files. The exhibition comprises 250 works, installations, paintings and sculptures by 31 artists of European, North American and Asian origin who, since the late 1950s and 1960s, have synthesized the upheavals in all areas of culture in the Happening and Fluxus movements in favour of a renewal of the artistic field in an interdisciplinary and intermediary manner, transcending everyday life and as the seed of a fundamental social transformation. = Fluxus artists within the collection = * Eric Andersen * Ay-O * George Brecht * Giuseppe Chiari * Philip Corner * Willem De Ridder * Robert Filliou * Henry Flynt * Al Hansen * Geoffrey Hendricks * Dick Higgins * Joe Jones * Allan Kaprow * Milan Knížák * Alison Knowles * Shigeko Kubota * Jean-Jacques Lebel * George Maciunas * Walter Marchetti * Charlotte Moorman * Yoko Ono * Nam June Paik * Benjamin Patterson * Takako Saito * Antonio Saura * Mieko Shiomi * Gianni-Emilio Simonetti * Daniel Spoerri * Ben Vautier * Wolf Vostell * Robert Watts * Emmett Williams  Movies  * 1976: VOAEX, by Ulrike Ottinger. * 1982: Wolf Vostell - Mitten am Rande der Welt, (part 1  part 2) by Jürgen Böttcher. * 1994: Traumziele, Zwischen Berlin und Malpartida - auf den Spuren von Wolf Vostell, by Werner Filmer y Ernst - Michael Wingens. * 2015: Malpartida Fluxus Village, de María Pérez. * 2016: Documentary, by Jesús Alonso Ovejero for RTVE.

Harleston was recorded in the Domesday Book as Heroluestuna. Harleston was a chapelry in Reddenhall parish. Many Georgian residences and much earlier buildings, with Georgian frontages, line the streets of Harleston. Although there is no record of a royal charter, Harleston has been a market town since at least 1369 and still holds a Wednesday market. One of the plots to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I was to be launched on Midsummer Day 1570 at the Harleston Fair by proclamations and the sound of trumpets and drums. The Elizabethan play Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay features this in one of its scenes.

The film, a coproduction between Italy, Spain, and Mexico, was and shot in widescreen (Cinetotalscope) in Italian in Cinecittà, Rome. Set in Tarsus, in the Roman province of Cilicia, 120 CE, the plot follows two Christian sisters who are sold as slaves in a story of love, vengeance, religious persecution, and martyrdom.  Plot  Beautiful and proud, Julia Marcia, is the spoiled daughter of Julius Tiberius, the Roman Proconsul of the province of Cilicia in the city of Tarsus. Julia's ailing father wants to betroth her to Flavius Metellus, a member of the Senate who is in love with her. This would leave Julia's future settle and Flavius could succeed his future father in law as governor of the province. However, Julia is reluctant to comply with her father's wishes. She is in love, but unrequited, with her friend the tribune Marco Valerio. While together on an excursion through town, Julia and Marcus come across to an auction where two sisters of Carthaginian origin are sold as slaves. Marco is immediately smitten with the blond sister, Lea, while his friend, Tullius, a Roman soldier, is attracted to the other sister, Esther, a brunette. These beautiful and educated slaves command a high asking price so Marco Valerio buys the sisters for Julia Marcia who pays for the transaction. During a dinner party at her father's opulent palace in Tarsus, Julia Marcia has Lea sung for her guest, but her Carthaginian aria displeases Julia who orders Lea to be harshly punished. Marco Valerio's obvious interest in Lea's beauty and sweetness drives Julia to cruelty. She orders her main servant, Afra, herself a former slave, to lash Lea frequently. Meanwhile, Esther is befriended by a fellow slave, Stephen, who is a Christian like the two sisters. Gradually, Esther and Stephen fall in love. The greedy and unscrupulous chief treasurer, Publio Cornelio, plots in the Senate to conquer power. With this aim, he convinces the weak-minded Flavius Metellus to assassinate the proconsul and accuse the Christians of the crime leaving a cross on the scene to implicate them. The plan succeeds. After her father's assassination, Julia Marcia, in order to maintain her status and fortune, marries Flavio Metello, the new proconsul. Believing the Christians were responsible for her father's death, Julia orders to persecute them. This is not a difficult task as most of them are already slaves. The Christian, including Lea, Esther, and Stephen are arrested and sent to forced labor in the mills. Marco Valerio is ordered to carry out the campaign of persecuting the Christian, but he is soon convinced of their innocence as his friendship with the pious Lea allows him to see their courage and faith. After trying to defend them before the senate, Marco is forced to flee. The Christian are sent to the dungeons waiting to be put to death. Furious of Marco's escape, Julia Marcia interrogates Lea about his whereabouts. Lea actually does not know where he is. In revenge, Julia orders Lea to be blinded by a white-hot sword. Marco Valerio finds refuge with fellow soldiers on abandoned caves outside the city and through his friend, Tullius rally up his supporters in the region including the powerful Praetor Licinius and the senators Faustus Domitius and Horace Tiberius. They all plan to remove Flavius Metellus and the corrupt Publio Cornelio from power taking the city military from two sides. They agree to finance the plan. However, Marco Valerio is arrested after a shepherd reveals his location. He joins the two sisters and the Christian in the dungeons. He is outraged finding that Lea is now blind. Esther and Stephen are married in the dungeon by their deacon but all Christian are sentenced to death. They are going to be crucified on the hill and then burned alive. Marco Valerio is freed by his supporters headed by his friend Tullius. In the bloody battle that follows Marco rescues Lea from the crux but while freeing Esther, Tullios is killed by an arrow. Julia Marcia and her husband, Flavius Metellus try to flee with their lives, but in her escape, Julia falls and is being trampled to death by the horses. Publio Cornelio, very unpopular for raising taxes, is killed when he arrives in the city. Marco Valerio and Flavio Metolius face each other on a chariot race by the beach where hero and villain fight it out to the death on the sands. During the duel, Flavio admitting his guilt, and to expiate his crime, stabs himself with Marco's dagger. Lea and Marco are married and Christianity becomes accepted.

The street plan separates a private residential zone from the naval station and the commercial and sacred areas of the port. Each urban block measured 40.37m by 47.40m and was divided into two rows of four houses. The urban blocks formed neighbourhoods known as synoikies, which comes from the word synoecism (or synoikismos, Greek: συνоικισμός), which means the merging of smaller communities into one larger community. Each of these neighbourhoods was accessed by a street with a width of 5m to 5.20m. These were known as Small Roads and were linked to peripheral streets with a width of 8m to 8.2m, known as Medium Roads. The whole city was bisected by two main streets of 16.5m known as plateies odoi, or Large Roads. These linked the public areas of the city with the main entrances to the city.Ministry of Culture, Ephorate of Antiquities of West Attika, Piraeus and Islands, information board at the site Location and discovery The site belongs to the Organization of School Buildings (Organismos Scholikon Ktirion) and excavations were undertaken during the building of the Ralleios School, in 1995-6 and 200–2001. The excavations revealed an entire urban block of the Classical Period together with different types of underground cisterns showing the evolution of the city's drainage system which included a sewerage pipeline. The excavated site has two parallel Small Roads, one to the south with urban blocks located either side of it, and one to the north. The Small Road to the south runs parallel to the present-day Skouze Street. Roman Period During the Roman period some of the plots on the eastern part of the site were consolidated and a large Roman mansion was built. The mansion covered the same area as four classical houses. This mansion has an atrium with a central peristyle and pebble floor. A portico gives access to the rooms of the mansion. The mansion was probably destroyed during the Sack of Athens (267 AD), based on the evidence of the many coins found on the site and which date from this time. Finds A votive naiskos of Cybele, marble statuettes of Aphrodite and clay figurines of Eros have been found on site. These indicate that the Mother of Gods and Aphrodite were household cults. Other coins found on the site date from the fifth century BC to the 4th century AD.

He introduced the Oregon Children's Plan to identify and assist at-risk children and their families. Kitzhaber allowed two executions to be carried out in his first term, despite his moral opposition to the practice: Douglas Franklin Wright in 1996 and Harry Charles Moore in 1997. In 2011, he said \\"they were the most agonizing and difficult decisions I have made as Governor... I have regretted those choices ever since.\\"  1998 election  1982, Kitzhaber defeated activist Bill Sizemore with 64.4% of the vote in the 1998 election. Kitzhaber was challenged in 1998 by Republican anti-tax activist Bill Sizemore. Sizemore had founded Oregon Taxpayers United, a political action committee that lobbied against tax increases and promoted ballot measures limiting the use of union dues in political campaigns, in 1993. After The Oregonian published information on Sizemore's questionable business practices. At the end of the election, Kitzhaber received 717,061 votes (64.4%), easily defeating Sizemore's 334,001 votes (30.0%). Kitzhaber won all but one (Malheur) county, a rarity in Oregon. This is the biggest landslide since Republican Vic Atiyeh won with 61.4% of the vote in 1982. This election also had significantly more third party candidates including Libertarian Richard P. Burke (20,200 votes/1.81%), Pacific Green Blair Bobier (15,843/1.42%), Reform candidate Roger G. Weidner (10,144/0.91%), Natural Law candidate Patti Steurer (7,823/0.70%), and Socialist Trey Smith (5,772/0.52%).http://records.sos.state.or.us/ORSOSWebDrawer/Recordpdf/6920722 Retrieved 2010-02-05  Seceond term (1999–2003)  Kitzhaber meeting with doctors at the National University of Natural Medicine in Portland, shortly before his third term. During his second term, Kitzhaber created multiple natural resources related policy initiatives including The Oregon Plan for Salmon and Watersheds. This plan worked to restore dwindling runs of threatened salmon species to Oregon's rivers and streams. The plan was a collaborative effort forcing local, state, and federal agencies to work with private landowners to restore watershed health and recover threatened salmon runs. Kitzhaber made the controversial decision to breach multiple dams in the state to help restore salmon populations. Kitzhaber was a staunch supporter of Oregon's comprehensive land use system and worked to manage growth in the Willamette Valley and other parts of the state. He heavily protected the protection of farmland and the enforcement of the urban growth boundary. In order to gather information to help develop sustainable communities, he established the Governor's Growth Task Force and the Willamette Valley Livability Forum. He created the Community Solutions program to focus the efforts of multiple state agencies, local government, and other groups in collaborative problem solving and coordination to manage various community development projects throughout Oregon. The Constitution of Oregon is unique in that it has no term-limits, but prevents more that two simultaneous terms. Because of this, Kitzhaber was ineligible for re-election in the next election.  2010 election  In the closest election in recent Oregon history, Kitzhaber defeated former NBA star Chris Dudley with a margin of less than 2%. 2010 election.

This election was called a tossup with 10 polls favoring Kitzhaber, and 11 favoring Dudley. In the end, Kitzhaber won with 716,525 votes (49.3%), compared to Dudley's incredibly close 694,287 votes (47.8%). Dudley had led in early vote counts, but Kitzhaber's wide margins in Multnomah and Lane counties eventually erased Dudley's lead. This was the first time Oregon used its new cross nomination system, a form of fusion voting. In this system, a candidate for partisan public office can be nominated by up to three political parties. Kitzhaber was nominated by the Independent Party of Oregon in addition to the Democratic Party. Third Party candidates included Constitution candidate Greg Kord (20,475/1.41%) and Libertarian Wes Wagner (19,048/1.31%).  Third term (2011-15)  On November 22, 2011, Kitzhaber announced that he would allow no executions to occur in Oregon while he is governor, calling the issuing of death sentences \\"compromised and inequitable\\". This commuted inmate Gary Haugen who refused to be pardoned, wanting to be executed. Senior Judge Timothy P. Alexander, assigned to Marion County Circuit Court, ruled that Haugen could reject the governor's reprieve of his execution and move forward in his efforts to die by lethal injection. Kitzhaber appealed the decision to the Oregon Supreme Court, which decided in the governor's favor on June 20, 2013.

Hayes admitted to the union, which was dissolved in the early 2000s, and said it was an illegal green card marriage into which she entered for money during a difficult period in her life. Kitzhaber was unaware of the marriage until the Willamette Week's investigation. Kitzhaber later admitted at a debate that he was \\"taken aback and hurt\\" to learn of it. Just days later, local news stations reported that Hayes was involved in another criminal scheme in 1997 involving a marijuana grow operation in Washington, to which Hayes also admitted.

Kitzhaber was cross-nominated by the Working Families Party of Oregon, and Richardson was cross-nominated by the Independent Party of Oregon. In the end, Kitzhaber received 733,230 votes (49.89%) and Richardson received 648,542 votes (44.13%).

The state saw the largest Democratic majorities in the Oregon Legislative Assembly since he became governor in 1994. In his inaugural address, Kitzhaber indicated his fourth gubernatorial term would be the last one he would seek, saying it \\"will complete the arc of my political career\\". He said his primary focus for his fourth term would be on socioeconomic inequality in Oregon during his last four years as governor of the state.  Resignation  First Lady Cylvia Hayes. The subject of Kitzhaber's scandals. Despite his efforts to focus on policy, Kitzhaber continued to grapple with controversies related to his fiancée and her work as a consultant and for the state. At a press conference on January 30, 2015, he said Hayes would play no further role in his administration, although he confirmed the couple still plans to marry. The Oregonian, which endorsed him in his 2010 and 2014 campaigns, called on him to resign, though Kitzhaber refuse to do so. Senate President Peter Courtney, Speaker of the House Tina Kotek, and State Treasurer (and later Portland Mayor) Ted Wheeler all released statements calling on Kitzhaber to resign. On February 12, the Willamette Week reported that Kitzhaber's executive assistant had tried to have thousands of the governor's emails deleted the previous week. The next day, Kitzhaber announced his resignation (effective February 18, 2015). After 28 months of investigation, in 2017, the federal government declined to continue its investigation. In January 2019, Kitzhaber agreed to pay $20,000 in civil penalties to the Oregon Government Ethics Commission for conflicts of interest involving Hayes while he was Governor. That month, Hayes also agreed to pay the Commission fines totaling \\"$44,000 for ethics violations arising from her use of public office for personal profit.\\" References :Category:Politicians ","title":"Governorship of John Kitzhaber"},{"id":"64349877","text":"Valentina Semyonovna Khetagurova (; 19141992), was a founder of the Khetagurova movement, a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for the Russian Far East.

South or Southern Europeans can usually trace back full or partial heritage to Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain, as well as nations bordering with, or ethnoculturally related to, the region. As the pan-ethnic group is also culturally defined, rather than exclusively a geographical category, it often includes peoples inhabiting areas that are, at times, considered outside of the region. This can include people with heritage from Southern France, the Mediterranean islands of Corsica (also part of France), Malta and Cyprus (geographically part of West Asia), Southeastern Europe's Albania and European Turkey. There are also descriptions of Southern Europeans which include ancestry from other nations in Southeast Europe, and countries of the South Slavs, particularly in diasporic identification. As Slavs, they are also often identified as Eastern Europeans. There is a large Southern European diaspora, with significant concentrations in the United Kingdom, North America (Southern European Americans and Canadians), and Southern European Australians in Oceania. Other subgroups of Europeans include Eastern European people and Northwestern European people. Background Southern European people have been widely identified as a distinct pan-ethnic group, being researched academically, studied culturally and reported on in journalistic and scholarly works. Although Southern Europeans are often defined by heritage or descent from the geographic southern extremities of Europe, the identification also has cultural meaning, and includes various peoples native to regions adjoining with, or islands in, the Mediterranean sea. Many of the territories in Macaronesia are geographically closer to Africa than Europe, and remain significantly populated by Portuguese and Spanish people. Cyprus is geographically considered one of the westernmost parts of West Asia, and is populated mainly by Greek Cypriots. In this regard, Southern Europeans are a cultural and pan-ethnic group, as well as a geographic category and the modern inhabitants of Southern Europe. In diasporic terms, the grouping has been broadened to include a wider scope of nationalities, whether through convenience or Anglo-centric perspectives, such as with Americans or Australians of Southern European descent. Culture In 2013, Ed Vulliamy suggested that Northwestern Europeans revered Southern European lifestyles, while their various national medias portrayed the region's financial stability and work ethic negatively. According to Umeå University, a 2016 European Social Survey showed that Southern Europeans (especially Portuguese people) alongside Eastern Europeans, reported various measures of health to be in a worse state (including depression, mental health, headaches, and overall physical health) when compared with several Northwestern European peoples, such as Swedes, Irish, Finns, Swiss, and Norwegians. In 2018, Eurostat data revealed how the group were leaving home as adults at the highest ages across Europe, with Maltese people (staying at home, on average, to over 32 years of age) being the highest in the EU. In 2018, the UK government's Loneliness minister, Mims Davies, recommended that British families adopt the vacation customs of Southern European people, by including their grandparents on family holidays. Academic research A 1998 study, published in the Atherosclerosis journal, studied postprandial dip in Southern Europeans (30 Greeks) compared with Northern Europeans (30 Britons and Irish people). Research has been conducted comparing Southern Europeans' average height, human body weight, and body mass index against Northern Europeans and people living in Central Europe. Diaspora There are significant diasporas of Southern Europeans, both within other regions of Europe, and to other continents. Some of these diasporic groups included, Southern European Americans and Southern European Canadians in North America, and Southern European Australians in Oceania. Southern Europeans have left a strong legacy In Latin America, both in the cultural and genetic sense. Europe Southern Europeans have emigrated to large economies in Northwestern Europe, such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom. This has been attributed to Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union, lack of employments opportunities in Mediterranean European countries, and specific events, such as the 2009 Euro crisis. Tens of thousands of the group settled in London in the 2010s. From 2006 to 2011, 25,000 Southern Europeans moved to France, with 60 percent of the increase represented by Portuguese people alone. A 2016 report on Southern European migration showed that, of Europe's larger economies, Germany and the UK remained most attractive to the group for resettlement and work, ahead of France. A 2019 study showed that young Southern European people have been particularly drawn to the job markets of London and Berlin since 2008, and that the attraction of the cities may encourage the group to accept poor employment conditions, rather than return home. North AmericaEarly immigration= Despite bias against the group from Wilfrid Laurier's government, Southern Europeans came to Canada in significant numbers between 1896 and 1905, under the charge of Minister of the Interior Clifford Sifton. While policy initially prioritzed immigrants from Northwestern Europe to work on the Canadian Prairies, many newcomers arrived from Mediterranean Europe between 1903 and 1914, working in Canada's industrial sectors, including railways, lumbering and mining. In the United States from 1900, the pan-ethnic group emigrated continuously for decades, until the advent of the 1965 Immigration Act. Despite opposition to the Act in the US Congress (which outlined how Greek, Portuguese, and Spanish immigration numbers had already reduced naturally in 1924); academics Gary Gerstle and John Mollenkopf have suggested that the passing of the legislation permanently ended further demographically significant Southern European immigration into the country. Canada also manifested a growing anti-immigration stance against the group around this time period. In the US, Southern Europeans have been perceived to be in cultural opposition to the American establishment, which according to geographer Donald W. Meinig, created various societal tension with Old Stock Americans during the early 20th-century. The group were often discrimated against, and judged inadequate against a criterion of whiteness invented by Northwestern European Americans. Slurs, such as dago or wop, were directed at Southern Europeans of many different heritages in North America. =Integration and success= Southern Europeans born in the US between 1956 and 1965 (by that point, often third or fourth generational) were indistinguishable in educational outcomes, including bachelor's degrees, with British Americans. From 1945 to 1973, during the post-war boom, the group became heavily represented in industrial towns such as Lansing, Michigan, where a General Motors plant attracted new labor and providing working-class occupations. In Canada, political philosopher William Kymlicka has suggested that the group, along with French Canadians, had one of the lowest average incomes recorded in the 1986 Canadian census. Southern Europeans, living in Toronto and Montreal, were demonstrated to be one the least socially mobile ethnic groups by a 1994 study. =Culture= Southern Europeans tend to demonstrate family-centric behaviours in the United States when academically researched. Studies suggest co-habitation with parents, and grandparents, endures longer for the grouping than other ethnic groups in the US. Studies have revealed a similar pattern with the group in Canada. Young Southern Europeans living in Vancouver were shown, in a 2003 study in Canadian Studies in Population, to leave home at one the latest stages, remaining home-stayers longer than Chinese Canadians, Indian Canadians or British Canadians. In Canada, residential behavioural patterns of the group were shown to be most typically represented by Portuguese Canadians, from a 2004 Housing Studies journal piece. Other research has shown that Southern Europeans in Canada remain economically and culturally involved with their ancestral nations, despite globalization. =Academic research= There has been wide study of the pan-ethnic group's behaviours as multi-generational immigrants to North America. By 1990, while little study regarding the nutritional intake of Southern European Americans had been conducted, a 2003 study found that members of the group, particularly of Catholic backgrounds had lower risk of suicide than Northwestern European Canadians, including German Canadians or Scottish Canadians. Using a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism, a 2006 PLOS Genetics research study showed that (of 7 out of 11 tested) Americans, who self-reported being solely of Southern European heritage, had a closer clustering of base pairs in comparison to those who self-reported a mixed Southern and Northern European ancestry. A 2014 in-depth interviewing process of around 500 parents analyzed intergenerational conflict in Southern Europeans' family lives, compared with South Asian Canadians and other groupings.

This line provides service within the neighborhoods of Seven Corners, Arlington Forest, Lyon Park and Rosslyn in Fairfax and Arlington counties. Alongside the neighborhoods, it also brings service through the marketplace, businesses, and offices within the counties. Route description and service The 4A and 4B operate from Four Mile Run Division on various schedules. The 4A only operates during rush hours, while the 4B operates on a daily schedule. The 4A does not serve the neighborhoods of Courthouse, Lyon Park or Buckingham, but operates the entire route via Arlington Boulevard. The 4B runs through the neighborhoods in Arlington County, where the 4A does not operate through between terminals. The 4A and 4B run through the same intervals, as the route splits between Arlington Forest and Rosslyn station. History The Pershing Drive–Arlington Boulevard Line was introduced in 1926, as the route was part of the Washington Virginia & Maryland Coach Company. It was later operated by WMATA in 1973, when it acquired all routes from the WV&M.; Since 1973, the Pershing Drive–Arlington Boulevard Line consists of all 4 line. The 4 line provides reliable service within Fairfax and Arlington counties to connect from neighborhoods, to marketplaces, to landmarks, and to business. The Pershing Drive–Arlington Boulevard Line is a unique line, in which it retains its original name, without changing its name during service changes, despite that it ran under the Arlington Boulevard Line when it was operated by the WV&M.; After WMATA acquired the 4 line in 1973, the 4 line have its former terminus throughout the years. The 4A once operated between Rosslyn Metro and Culmore vía Arlington Boulevard. The 4B operated once to Jefferson Village (now West Falls Church), a neighborhood in Fairfax County. There was also routes 4E, 4H, and 4S which is part of the line alongside with routes 4A and 4B. Routes 4E, 4H, and 4S all operates up to Rosslyn station alongside with the 4A and 4B, however, the 4E starts from the neighborhood of Arlington Forest, the 4H from Seven Corners, and the 4S from Sleepy Hollow Road in Fairfax County. The 4A operates during weekdays, while the 4B ran daily, the 4E runs on a one way route during morning rush hours, the 4H runs during late night and Saturdays, and the 4S runs during rush hours, morning peak to Rosslyn and afternoon peak to the neighborhood of Sleepy Hollow. 1981 Changes On January 4, 1981, the 4B was truncated from Jefferson Village to Seven Corners. September 2006 Changes On September 24, 2006, route 4S was replaced by the 4H, no longer operating to Sleepy Hollow. These changes brings in more service for the 4H, operating during rush hours where the 4S usually runs. The 4H retains its original intervals following these changes. January 2012 Changes The new Seven Corners Transit Center opened on January 22, 2012 next to Seven Corners Shopping Center. The 4A, 4B, and 4H was rerouted to serve the new transit center to connect with other routes. The schedules of these trips remains unchanged, however, the 4B and the 4H will no longer alternate terminals at Leesburg Pike. 2013 Proposed Changes In 2013, WMATA proposed to restructure the 4A, 4B, 4E, and 4H. Route 4A was to discontinue all service between Culmore and Seven Corners Transit Center. Service will be provided by the 26A, as it operates via Leesburg Pike. It was also to reduce travel times to Rosslyn station, as riders can transfer via East Falls Church station, where the 26A will operate. Route 4E was proposed to be converted to the 4B, to reduce redundancy to the 4B during morning peak hours. Route 4H was proposed to be converted to the 4A, to reduce redundancy to the 4A during peak hours. The 4A will be designated to operate via Arlington Boulevard, and the 4B to operate via North Pershing Drive. The reason why WMATA planned these changes was to reduce low ridership on the segment between Culmore and Seven Corners, and to clear bus bunching in the line. These changes was also to improve on-time performance of the route. December 2013 Changes On December 29, 2013, major changes occurred in the 4 line. The 4H was discontinued and is replaced by the 4A, and the 4E was converted into 4B trips. These changes was made to clear up bus bunching, as the 4E have the same stops as the 4B, and the 4H have the same stops as the 4A. Alongside with these changes, the 4A was truncated to Seven Corners. Alternate service to Culmore via Leesburg Pike was replaced by the Annandale–East Falls Church Line (route 26A). The 4A have Saturday service following the discontinuation of the 4H. June 2016 Changes On June 26, 2016, Saturday service of the 4A is eliminated, making the route a weekdays only route. The 4B remains unchanged, but now operates every 45 minutes on Saturday. June 2018 Changes On June 24, 2018, the 4A midday service was eliminated, having the route to operate only during rush hours. All off-peak trips is now operated by route 4B. The short morning rush hour 4B trips is now extended from Arlington Forest to Seven Corners Transit Center, to improve ridership in the 4B. The bus frequency of the 4B was increased, from 60 minutes to 30 minutes on middays, and 75 minutes to 60 minutes on Sundays.  September 2020 proposed changes  On September 10, 2020 as part of its FY2022 proposed budget, WMATA proposed to eliminate route 4A service in order to reduce costs and low federal funds. WMATA also proposed to reduce weekend frequency on route 4B.

Early Life and Education  Hough was born and raised in the whaling city of New Bedford, Massachusetts. His father, George A. Hough, was the managing editor of The New Bedford Standard who serialized Moby-Dick (1851) in the Standard in 1912, while his mother, Abby Louise Beetle Hough, was the daughter of a Martha's Vineyard whaling captain. As a boy, he frequently vacationed in Martha's Vineyard. After high school, he enrolled at Columbia University, where he received his B.Litt in journalism in 1918 and met his wife, Elizabeth Bowie Hough.  Career  As a student at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Hough wrote a paper with Minna Lewinson, a fellow student, History of Service Rendered by the American Press, and received a Pulitzer Award in 1918 at the age of 22. 1918 was the only year this award was given. As a wedding present, Hough received the Vineyard Gazette from his father in 1920 and ran the newspaper for 45 years with his wife. He sold the paper to the former executive editor of The New York Times, James Reston, in 1968 but remained an editor and columnist until his death. His articles and editorials have focused on mundane life such as club meetings, high school athletic events, and church socials as well as preservation of traditional life on the island from commercialization by large corporations as McDonald's. He was also a conservation activist and led the fight against the demolition of Edgartown Harbor Light in 1938. He donated hundreds of acres of family land to a preserve to prevent development and founded the local land trust, Sheriff's Meadow Foundation, which oversees 2,900 acres of land on the island. Hough was also the author of 23 books and wrote reviews and articles for The New York Times Magazine, The Saturday Evening Post, and Esquire. His simplistic reflections made him the most widely quoted country writer in the nation since William Allen White, while subscribers of the newspaper grew from 600 to 13,000 at his death.

Description Sanctuary is a board game game designed by Bill Fawcett for one to six players set in the fictional city of Sanctuary popularized in the Thieves' World line of shared universe anthologies edited by Robert Asprin and Lynn Abbey. The game comes with the following components: * a 4-piece board depicting a map of Sanctuary * ten plastic tokens * cardboard pieces representing silver coins * two decks of cards * a rulebook * a ten-sided die and two six-sided dice * a box with cover art by Walter Velex The rulebook begins with a short introductory tale describing the arrival of Kadakithis, the new city governor, and his personal security guards, the Hell Hounds. Gameplay There are three ways to play: # In the game for 2–5 players, each player takes the role of a thief in Sanctuary. Responding to rumours, they travel to various parts of the city, avoiding guards in order to steal goods. The first player to collect 300 silver pieces and hide them in their secret cache wins the game. # In the game for six players, five players are thieves, and the sixth player takes on the role of Kadikithis, directing his Hell Hounds in an attempt to prevent robberies from taking place. # In the solitaire game, the player is Kadakithis, and tries to enforce the city's laws over the thieves' activities. The games for 2–5 players and 2–6 players offer optional Advanced rules, including * the ability to hire thugs * the ability to \\"case the joint\\" (do reconnaissance) before the attempted theft * subdivision of thefts into burglaries, muggings and picking pockets Reception In the August 1983 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #44), Charles Vasey admired the \\"startling\\" box art by Walter Velex, and called the artwork of the components \\"less good but full of feeling.\\" This was the first time that Vasey, a wargamer, had seen a multi-piece \\"jigsaw\\" board, and he thought it worked far better than the standard folding maps of the period, saying, \\"It's time for wargamers to lobby their manufacturers!\\" Overall, Vasey called the game \\"Bright and bouncy, it reminds me a little of one of the dafter games which still retains my loyalty - Heads & Feds, a junk game of dope dealing. I should add, mega-points here, you get little silvery coins to play with in the game just like at play- school!\\" Two issues later, in the October 1983 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #46), Alan Paull also thought the jigsaw-type board was \\"an excellent idea, which makes sure that the map is both easy to pack in the box and easy to set up on a playing surface without any annoying wrinkles or ridges.\\" Paull also liked the component artwork, calling it \\"of a good standard, though the backs of the cards, as in all Mayfair games, are plain except for the Mayfair logo.\\" He thought the game was a good family game, saying, \\" \\"Sanctuary will appeal to those seeking an uncomplicated game for all age ranges from twelve years old upwards. The rules are not long, and neither are they difficult to understand.\\" Paull concluded \\"Sanctuary is a good buy for the family,\\" and gave the game an average rating of 7 out of 10.

After a variety of early jobs he worked for the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE), including during the disputes of the 1978-9 Winter of Discontent. Poole represented five unions during the 1989–90 British ambulance strike and won a 16.9% pay settlement, a rare victory in the Thatcher era. He afterwards negotiated a merger with the National and Local Government Officers' Association and the Confederation of Health Service Employees to form Unison, for which he served as assistant general secretary. After retirement from the unions Poole served on the Northern Ireland Parades Commission and mediated in industrial disputes. He was also a visiting lecturer at Warwick University.  Early life  Roger Poole was born in Bristol on 11 July 1946 to Lillian and Samuel Poole; his father was a decorator and trade unionist. Poole attended the Ashton Gate Comprehensive School in Bristol, one of the first comprehensive schools in the country. While there he led a successful protest that saw the creation of the first football pitch at a school which had previously only played rugby. Poole left the school at the age of 15 with no qualifications and found work at a laboratory, as a motor mechanic and as a security guard at the Avonmouth Docks. Poole married Berenice Peglar in 1970 and the couple spent their honeymoon promoting British goods by travelling across the United States and South America on a double-decker bus, funded by a Confederation of British Industry grant; the trip ended when the bus sank in a river in Peru.  Union official  Upon his return to the United Kingdom Poole became an official for the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE), a trade union with members drawn largely from manual workers in the health service and local government. Poole became an assistant general secretary of the union which was embroiled in industrial disputes during the 1978-9 Winter of Discontent. The union action was unpopular and the Labour government was defeated at the 1979 general election by Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives. An army ambulance on call during the 1989–90 ambulance strike Poole learned from the experience and brought a different approach when he was appointed spokesman and chief negotiator for five unions during the 1989–90 British ambulance strike over pay for ambulance crews. Poole got a new haircut and bought a new suit for the negotiations. His \\"moderate, confident, bright and committed\\" demeanour at negotiations and press conferences brought public support behind the strike. The government response, under Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke, was, by contrast, divided and contradictory. Poole was able to secure a 16.9% pay rise for his members, a settlement that Poole claimed had driven \\"a coach and horses through the government’s pay policy\\". The settlement was a rare success for the unions in the Thatcher era and Poole, later described by The Independent as \\"a hero of the trade union movement\\", was runner-up in that year's Today programme's man of the year award. Poole helped to negotiate the 1993 merger of NUPE with the National and Local Government Officers' Association and the Confederation of Health Service Employees to form Unison and served as an assistant general secretary of the new union. In 1996 he won a court case on behalf a local government employee who had suffered several breakdowns during her employment. He warned employers that the result meant they had a responsibility to look after the mental wellbeing of their staff.  Later career  After his retirement from Unison Poole was appointed by Peter Hain to the Parades Commission, a public body with responsibility for monitoring parades in Northern Ireland, in 2005. This role required careful negotiation and mediation between different parading groups, many of whom were sectarian in nature. Poole failed to secure the co-operation of the Orange Order but nevertheless parades during his tenure on the commission, lasting until 2009, were more peaceful than those in other times. Poole afterwards worked as a mediator in industrial disputes including the 2007 Remploy factory closures and the 2009 Royal Mail dispute. He also adjudicated during an internal Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen dispute which had flared up into a brawl among its leaders at a union barbeque. Poole also worked as a visiting lecturer at Warwick University.  Personal life  Roger and Berenice Poole had one son, Jason, and a daughter, Jessica. He was a lifelong follower of the football club, Bristol Rovers. Poole died on 3 July 2015 in Droitwich, of colon cancer.

She began her career as a singer and dancer in the opera theater. After her marriage, she began publishing around 1929. She wrote the first lesbian novel in the Czech language and many of her works were written as inspirational novels for youth. She also wrote biographies of well-known personalities. Her works were banned in the communist era, but in the 21st century, there has been scholarship on her writing and involvement in the interwar period in the movement to gain civil rights for LGBT people in Czechoslovakia. Early life Ludmila Skokanová was born on 3 February 1906 in Prague, Austria-Hungary. She graduated from the Prague Conservatory in 1925 and began her career at the National Theater as a soubrette. Hired to work in the operatic ensemble at the Municipal Theater in Olomouc, she met the composer, conductor, and pedagogue, . The couple married in an arrangement of convenience and after her marriage, Pecháčkova turned to literary work. Career In 1929, using the pseudonym Lída Merlínová, Pecháčkova published the first lesbian novel written in the Czech language, Vyhnanci lásky (Exiles of Love). The book sold out within a few months, prompting fan mail, and praise from other writers, like Jiří Karásek. Throughout the 1930s, she wrote inspirational youth novels, often focusing on adventures for independent modern girls. Some of her works, such as Marie a Marta ve finiši (Marie and Marta in the Finish, 1934) and Činská dívka (Chinese Girl, 1938) had lesbian undertones. She was the primary lesbian writer for the journal, Hlas sexuální menšiny (The Voice of the Sexual Minority), and when it changed to Nový hlas in 1932, she continued to write articles on topical LGBT issues, like cross-dressing and finding the strength to overcome the adversity that LGBT people faced. She expressed in her writing that behaviors of some of the community made it more difficult for the rest of the community to be accepted by the heterosexual majority and gain full equality in society and before the law. In addition to her children's works Merlínová published biographical novels, including a 1935 work, Zdenin světový rekord (Zdenin's World Record, 1935) about Zdeněk Koubek, who underwent female to male gender reassignment surgery after having won two medals at the 1934 Women's World Games. Like her children's works, the novels she wrote for adults focused on emotionally and professionally capable women, and did not shy away from controversial topics. From the early 1930s to 1940, she also taught dance in Olomouc, but in the latter year, she and her husband moved to Dvora Král. She continued to teach dance even after they moved to Prague in 1945 after the liberation of the city. All of her works were banned during the communist period of Czechoslovakia, which began in 1948. Pecháček died in 1949, and Merlínová began a relationship with her female partner that would last until her death. Death and legacy Merlínová died on 11 July 1988 in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Largely forgotten during communism, she was included in the lexicon of Czech literary figures issued in 2000 and in the 21st century has been studied by academics both in the Czech Republic, as well as Britain and the United States, to reassess her literary contributions, as well as her involvement in the movement for LGBT rights that occurred in the country in the interwar period.

Criminal law  In criminal law, animus nocendi (\\"intention to harm\\") refers to an accused's guilty state of mind with respect to the actus reus of the crime. It is thus analogous to mens rea, a more commonly used term in common law countries. The term dates back Roman understandings of censorship, where it referred to an author's impermissible intention in writing a literary work. In Scots law, the term animus malus (\\"evil intention\\") is sometimes used.  Family law  In family law, animus deserendi refers to one spouse's firm intention to leave the matrimonial home—and hence the marriage. When combined with the \\"factum of separation,\\" it \\"constitute[s]\\" desertion. Proof of desertion, in turn, has been grounds for divorce in some legal systems.  Property law  In property law, animus possidendi (\\"intent to possess\\") refers to a person's manifest intention to control an object, and is one of the two elements—along with factum possidendi (the \\"fact of possession\\")—required to establish property in an object by first possession. In both civil and common law, animus revertendi distinguishes an animal in which one may have a property right from a wild animal (which one cannot own) by reference to the animal's habitual return to a person who cares for it. Blackstone describes the doctrine as follows: > The law therefore extends … possession farther than the mere manual > occupation; for my tame hawk that is pursuing his quarry in my presence, > though he is at liberty to go where he pleases, is nevertheless my property; > for he hath animum revertendi. So are my pigeons, that are flying at a > distance from their home … and likewise the deer that is chafed out of my > park or forest, and is instantly pursued by the keeper or forester: all > which remain still in my possession, and I still preserve my qualified > property in them. But if they stray without my knowledge, and do not return > in the usual manne[r], it is then lawful for any stranger to take them.  United States constitutional law  In the jurisprudence of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, animus designates an improper government purpose in passing legislation. According to Dale Carpenter, the animus doctrine involves \\"scrutinizing the reasons for government action.\\" If the legislature exhibits bias toward a protected class, the law is unconstitutional regardless whether the law might be justifiable on other grounds. The Supreme Court of the United States defined the concept for the first time in Department of Agriculture v. Moreno (1973), holding that (italics in original): > … if the constitutional conception of \\"equal protection of the laws\\" means > anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to > harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate > governmental interest. Referring to the concept of animus explicitly later in the same passage, the Supreme Court formulated the doctrine thus in United States v. Windsor (2013): > [The Defense of Marriage Act] seeks to injure the very class New York seeks > to protect. By doing so it violates basic due process and equal protection > principles applicable to the Federal Government.

Early life and education Florence Rose, born in New York City on June 20, 1903, was the youngest of three children and the only daughter of Jewish Hungarian immigrants, Charles and Katie Rosebaum. Rose was raised along with her brothers Felix and Leon in Brooklyn. In addition to secretarial training, her education included study at both Hunter College and Columbia University, but it is not clear whether she ever completed a degree. Early career After concluding her education, Rose held a variety of jobs that included sales, mail-order, and promotional work, often coupled with secretarial duties. From 1923 to 1929 she worked as a secretary and sales correspondent for the Larabee Flour Mills Corporation. In 1929, after she \\"spent one hot New York summer filing papers and then spent the next hot summer taking them all out,\\" Rose determined that she \\"had to find something purposeful\\" and decided to move into public welfare work. As a first step in that direction she worked as the Administrative Assistant for the New York Citizens Street Traffic Committee during 1929 and 1930. Encountering Margaret Sanger In July 1930, Rose gambled and wrote to the internationally known birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger—whom she admired but had never met—and explained that she wanted to \\"get out of a rut and change my present position while I am still young enough to be shaped into a really valuable assistant to some executive in a position that I can regard as life-long.\\" She billed herself as an \\"intelligent, loyal assistant,\\" offered Sanger her services, and pleaded with her for a brief meeting. As a result of this long shot, Sanger hired Rose to be her personal secretary and administrative assistant. Birth control movement 17-23 West 16th St. The Clinical Research Bureau operated here from 1930 to 1973; Rose worked at the Clinical Research Bureau from 1937 to 1939. Florence Rose began her official work for Sanger in September 1930 and ultimately devoted the next thirteen years of her life to the cause of birth control. In addition to her work for Sanger, \\"Rosie,\\" as she was affectionately known by her colleagues, also acted as the secretary to the National Committee for Federal Legislation on Birth Control from 1930 to 1937 and the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau's Educational Department from 1937 to 1939. In that capacity she developed promotional materials, engaged in lobbying efforts, and coordinated national birth control conferences. Wearing a wedding ring and calling herself \\"Mrs. Rose\\" to avoid the discrimination and harassment often encountered by single women traveling alone, Rose also toured the U.S. in 1933 to campaign for the repeal of the restrictive Comstock laws. In 1934 she accompanied Sanger on a visit to eleven European countries and the USSR and in 1937 she traveled to Asia to plan and coordinate public health conferences that would promote family planning. Rose became a minor celebrity after she survived the initial Japanese bombing of Shanghai and narrowly escaped war-torn China on a U.S. battleship with a few other American refugees in August 1937. In 1939 the American Birth Control League and the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau merged to become the Birth Control Federation of America (which would change its name to Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942). Having essentially achieved her goal of federal legislation to legalize birth control, Margaret Sanger formally retired and moved to her estate in Tucson. Though it was primarily her devotion to Sanger that had fueled Rose's work in the birth control movement, she stayed on in New York City after Sanger's retirement to work as a staff member in the Federation's Public Information Department. In 1940, Florence Rose organized and convened the National Negro Advisory Council to give support and advice to projects aimed at serving Black Americans. Council members included Walter G. Alexander, Claude Barnett (Ida B. Wells's son), Michael J. Bent, Mary McLeod Bethune, M. O. Bousfield, Paul Comely, W. E. B. Du Bois, Crystal Bird Fauset, E. Franklin Frazier, Dorothy Ferebee, Charles Hubert, Charles S. Johnson, John Lawlah, Peter Marshall Murray, Rev. A. Clayton Powell, Ira De Augustine Reid, Bishop David A. Sims, Mabel Staupers, Mary Church Terrell, and Walter Francis White. In 1941 she was appointed the Director of the Special Projects Department which planned and developed new areas of activity. Rose can be largely credited with the development of Planned Parenthood's National Negro Educational Program, its National Clergyman's Advisory Council, and its Public Progress Committee. After Planned Parenthood=Foundation work and healthcare In July 1943, after several years of tension and conflict with Planned Parenthood director Kenneth Rose (no relation), Florence Rose resigned from the organization. Following her resignation she worked briefly for the Holland-Rantos Company which manufactured contraceptives, organized Sanger's papers for the Library of Congress, and performed research for the New York philanthropist Ethel Clyde. She continued as an advocate for social change, writing in the New York Times about the problem of hunger among children in war-torn parts of the world. From July 1944 until May 1945 Rose worked as a consultant to Pearl Buck who had recently founded the East and West Association to facilitate the interchange of knowledge between average men and women in Asia, the USSR, and the United States. Rose developed fundraising and promotional programs for the East and West Association during her brief association with Buck. She resigned from the job so that she could explore opportunities for employment in the West. After recovering from a serious Labor Day automobile accident, in late 1945 Rose moved to Tucson, Arizona to take a job as the Assistant Business Administrator of the newly opened Tucson Medical Center. She resigned from the Tucson Medical Center after only one year on the job. Meals for Millions In the fall of 1946, she moved to Los Angeles to take over the leadership of the hunger relief and prevention organization Meals for Millions Foundation from its founder Clifford E. Clinton. As the Executive Director of Meals for Millions, Rose worked tirelessly from 1946 to 1964 to build the organization, raise funds, and promote the distribution of Multi-Purpose Food, a very inexpensive soy-based product that could provide nearly complete nutrition to starving people. Using the public relations skills she had learned in the birth control movement, Rose succeeded in popularizing Multi-Purpose Food, distributing 65,000,000 meals in 127 countries and establishing many international Meals for Millions Associations. After her retirement as Executive Director in 1964, Rose spent the next four years as the Meals for Millions Overseas Coordinator. During that time she traveled around the world to oversee the hunger relief and prevention programs she had set up earlier. Family and friends Rose took responsibility for the care of her ailing mother, who died in 1936. She maintained close relationships with her brother and sister-in-law, Leon and Rae Rose and participated in raising their children, Charles and Karen, including subsidizing their educations. Though she was long estranged from her brother Felix Rosenbaum (known in his adult life as Phil), she reconciled with him in the late 1950s when he was ill and down on his luck. Rose sent him advice and money regularly and, when he died in late 1961, it was she who arranged his funeral and put his affairs in order. Rose also had a large circle of friends and colleagues throughout U.S. and the world. Despite the long distances that separated them, she maintained close relationships with friends she had made during her youth in New York. She also kept in touch with many of her friends and colleagues from the birth control movement. In addition to Leon and Rae Rose, her most important personal relationships over the course of her life were with her colleagues Margaret Sanger and Ernest Chamberlain. Mental health struggles and death Almost everyone who described Florence Rose remarked on her small stature (she was less than five feet tall), her energy, her enthusiasm, and her selfless dedication to the causes she championed. But despite her cheerful demeanor Rose experienced several episodes of depression during her adult life, some of them severe. In 1935 she offered to resign as Sanger's secretary because something had \\"gone wrong with the works\\" making her feel \\"utterly inadequate as a human being, ignorant of the most obvious matters to others, monstrously self-centered, and lacking in the most common decency and will-power to stop worrying others about her condition.\\" Desperate, Rose sought help from various sources, including requesting prayers from the leaders of the Unity School of Christianity in Kansas City. After watching Rose deteriorate for several months, Margaret Sanger arranged a lengthy paid leave for her so she could travel to Arizona to rest and recover. Ultimately Rose obtained treatment for a previously undiagnosed thyroid deficiency which seemed to restore her mental health. In 1968, facing a personal audit by the Internal Revenue Service and her final departure from Meals for Millions, Rose succumbed to another severe depression. This episode is not well-documented (Rose's papers include almost nothing generated by her after July 1968 when she began to mention feeling \\"paralyzed\\" and \\"dormant\\") but correspondence between others reveals the extent of her debilitation. In December 1968, Rose's longtime friend Henrietta Voorsanger wrote to Ernest Chamberlain to ask about Rose's \\"medical or mental condition,\\" whether she had \\"qualified psychiatric care,\\" and whether she was \\"able to live alone.\\" Ernest Chamberlain described her final months of life as a \\"a despairing effort to regain her mental poise, outlook, and above all, enthusiasm.\\" Unfortunately, this time Rose did not recover. She committed suicide on April 26, 1969. In a 1968 interview with Mary Barber of the Los Angeles Times she said, \\"I do think I have an intuitive awareness of greatness in people and feel drawn to be their hands and legs. I want to free them to do the work they must do--great people must not spend time with dog work.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Digitized primary sources from the Florence Rose papers, Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College * Florence Rose papers at the Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College Category:American birth control activists Category:Women nonprofit executives Category:Sex educators Category:1903 births Category:1969 deaths ","title":"Florence Rose"},{"id":"64350503","text":"Ray DeSilva (born 3 February 1967) is a Bermudian sailor.

In 2020, a New York Times opinion piece brought to light Goddard's contributions to the development of the modern SAK, more commonly known as a rape kit. She has been credited with giving the idea to crime lab analyst Louis R. Vitullo, long credited as the rape kit's inventor. In 1972, Goddard was volunteering at a crisis hotline for teenagers on Halsted Street in Chicago. Speaking with displaced youths, she discovered sexual abuse at home was often a primary reason for their running away. Rape was \\"epidemic\\" in Chicago at the time, according to scholars like Naomi Weisstein, and it was often treated as a \\"feminine delusion\\" rather than a solvable crime. Goddard spoke with victims, ER workers and forensics experts to see what would help to gather evidence. She shared her findings with Vitullo, who dismissed her, to only later debut his own version of the rape kit while failing to credit Goddard.

Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Camp Robber Creek and Foss River, both tributaries of the Skykomish River. This peak's name is derived from Camp Robber Creek and Camp Robber Lake, which lie in Camp Robber Valley to the northwest of the peak. \\"Camp robber\\" is the colloquial name for several North American species of birds known for their fearlessness around humans and their proclivity for stealing food from campers. The nearest higher neighbor is Wild Goat Peak, to the south. Climate Camp Robber Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada–US border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

In the riot, Javanese townspeople burned and looted the Chinese district, resulting in roughly 10 deaths and dozens of injuries, and causing half of the Chinese population of the city to flee to Semarang and other cities in Java. Context The riot in Kudus was not an isolated incident, but happened in a context of anti-colonial resistance in the Dutch East Indies by organizations such as the Sarekat Islam, the rise of Chinese nationalism, rapid social change, and a breakdown of the traditional relationship between the Chinese Indonesians and the Javanese population. As the Chinese in the Indies often acted as middlemen between the Indonesians and the Dutch, they were also vulnerable to attacks which were aimed at the colonial economy or social injustice. An Indonesian historian who wrote a thesis about the Kudus riot, Masyhuri, stated that the immediate factors that contributed to the riot were the particularly strong religious attitude of Muslims in Kudus, and the rise of far left radicalism which he believes primed the Muslim townspeople for radical action. He notes that most Dutch sources blamed the Sarekat Islam, which he rejected as an oversimplification that may have come from their dislike of that organization. On the other hand, The Siauw Giap, who wrote a 1966 article on the Kudus riot, believed that there were systematic preconditions for anti-Chinese violence in Indonesian history which could spill over when conditions were right. In this case he partly blamed the very recent economic competition in the kretek cigarette industry between Chinese and Indonesian owners for the breakdown in relations in Kudus. The incident that precipitated the riot itself happened the day before. In late October 1918, the Kudus Chinese community had been holding ritual processions through the city to honour a folk religious figure Tua Pek Kong in the hopes of warding off the Influenza epidemic ravaging the city. On October 30th, one of these processions where participants were wearing costumes of Arabs, Africans, Chinese kings, and so on, came face to face with Javanese townspeople who were repairing the Menara Kudus Mosque. The sight of the mock Hadji and Arab costumes angered some of the Muslims who were there. The procession ground to a halt as wagons going in two opposite directions refused to make way; it turned into a brawl that was broken up by the police. Events of October 31st On the morning of October 31st a meeting was called at the office of the Kudus Sarekat Islam with the participation of the police superintendent, the Chinese Officer of Kudus, and others, to calm tensions over the brawl. But at the same time, some people (who may or may not have been connected to the Sarekat Islam) were going around the nearby Javanese towns and districts, calling people to meet at the mosque tower at 6 pm. The police set up checkpoints in Kudus, but as nothing had happened by 8 pm, many of their officers headed home. It was at that point that about 80 Javanese townspeople walked into the Chinese district and started trying to break down doors, while a crowd watched from a distance. The police were still on site but were too few to stop the emerging riot. So the number of riots grew to a much larger number, possible 2000 people, and started burning down houses and businesses in the Chinese district. At this point the Resident of Kudus called to the Regent of Semarang Regency to ask for military assistance. What happened later in the night is disputed. According to the historian Masyhuri, by 10:30 pm many of the original rioters started to leave, carrying off valuables with them, and some of those who remained started to help the victims. On the other hand, the Semarang newspaper Djawa Tengah said that the rioters suddenly turned and battled the police at around this time, with many wounded, including one who later died in the hospital. Masyhuri emphasized that the Kudus Chinese did not attempt to resist the riot, and many hid in their homes and fled with nothing when those were being destroyed. The riot finally ended in the early hours of the morning of November 1st as the troops arrived from Semarang. Aftermath The immediate consequence of the riot was the flight of nearly half the Chinese population of Kudus (roughly two out of four thousand) to Semarang and other cities. Newspapers on the following day reported the sight of the morning train arriving in Semarang with all 8 train cars completely full of Chinese families from Kudus. The Dutch language newspaper De Locomotief from Semarang reported on that day that 9 Chinese people had been confirmed dead, 7 of whom died in fires, and that the number of dead on the Javanese side had not been released. By November 1st, the Dutch colonial police raided Javanese towns in and around Kudus and, after 3 weeks had arrested an estimated 159 people. The Sarekat Islam denounced these arrests as indiscriminate and arbitrary, as many townspeople were arrested after the fact with little evidence. They denied their organization's involvement in the riot and accused the Dutch of targeting their Kudus membership for political reasons in the middle of the mass arrests. The Chinese community of the Dutch East Indies, which was wealthy but did not have political power, organized to support the Kudus victims who they felt had been abandoned by the Dutch authorities. Some early fundraising happened in Semarang as labor organizations and merchants coordinated housing and supplies for the displaced Kudus Chinese. It was in an Indies-wide meeting on November 16th that a formal organization was set up to coordinate the relief efforts, so that local organizations around the Indies could send money to single central committee. Trial A mass trial was held for those arrested after the Kudus riot. It took place at the courthouse (Landraad) in Semarang and was a front-page news story in many local newspapers on a daily basis from December 1919 to February 1920. The final sentencing took place on February 25th 1920, where a significant number of the arrested were sentenced to 3 to 5 years in prison, although some were released due to lack of evidence. Cultural references The journalist and novelist Tan Boen Kim wrote a fictionalized account of the Kudus riot, which he published in 1920, called Riot in Kudus: A true story which happened in Central Java not long ago.

A branch of the Tanukhid tribal confederation, they were established in the Gharb by the Muslim atabegs of Damascus following the capture of Beirut by the Crusaders in 1110 to guard the mountainous frontier between the Crusader coastlands and the Islamic interior of the Levant. They were granted iqtas (revenue fiefs) over villages in the Gharb and command over its peasant warriors, who subscribed to the Druze religion, which the Buhturids professed. Their iqtas were successively confirmed, decreased or increased by the Burid, Zengid, Ayyubid and Mamluk rulers of Damascus in return for military service and intelligence gathering in the war with the Crusader lordships of Beirut and Sidon. In times of peace the Buhturids maintained working relations with the Crusaders. The Buhturids' peak of power occurred under the Circassian Mamluk sultan Barquq (), whom they supported during his seizure of power from his Turkic predecessors. The Buhturids grew their wealth through commercial enterprises, exporting silk, olive oil and soap to Mamluk officials in Egypt from Beirut and attaining the governorship of Beirut twice, in the 1420s and 1490s–1500s. They maintained the respect of the peasants of the Gharb for safeguarding their interests against government measures, promoting agriculture and keeping at bay their local rivals, the Turkmen emirs of the Keserwan. During the closing years of Mamluk rule, Buhturid influence receded to the benefit of their old allies, the Druze Ma'n dynasty of the Chouf. They continued to control the Gharb through Ottoman rule until the family was massacred by the Druze chief Ali Alam al-Din in 1633. Origins Islamic Levant. The Tanukh encamped near Aleppo and Qinnasrin throughout Byzantine and Umayyad rule until migrating to the mountains northwest of Homs in the late 8th century The Buhturids were a clan of the Tanukh, an Arab tribal confederation whose presence in the Levant dated to at least the 4th century CE when they served as the first Arab foederati (tribal confederates) of the Byzantine Empire. At the time, the Tanukh were ardent Orthodox Christians, and remained in Byzantine service until the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s. Although part of the confederation fled to Byzantine Anatolia, they primarily remained in their dwelling places around Aleppo and Qinnasrin (Chalcis) in the northern Levant and eventually allied with the Levant-based Umayyad Caliphate (661–750) while largely retaining their Christian faith. After the execution of their preeminent chieftain Layth ibn Mahatta by the Iraq-based Abbasid caliph al- Mahdi () for refusing to embrace Islam, the tribe converted and their churches were destroyed. During the reign of al-Mahdi's son Harun al-Rashid (), the Tanukh's settlements were raided by rebels, forcing their flight from the Qinnasrin area to the northern Levantine coastal mountains, which were thenceforth called Jabal Tanukh or Jabal Bahra' after the Tanukh and the tribe of Bahra'. Establishment in the Gharb The Tanukh's entry into the area of modern Lebanon, south of Jabal Tanukh, was \\"the last stage of their historical role in Bilad al-Sham [the Islamic Levant]\\", according to the historian Irfan Shahid. The Sijill al-Arslani (genealogical registers of the Arslan family of Choueifat) states that the Tanukh began moving into Mount Lebanon under the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur (), who ordered a number of the tribe's chiefs to secure the coast and lines of communication around Beirut from Byzantine attack. Epistle 50, one of the Epistles of Wisdom composed by Druze missionaries in the early 11th century, was explicitly directed to three Tanukhid emirs settled in the mountainous Gharb area southeast of Beirut, calling on them to continue the tradition of their ancestors in spreading Druze teachings. The Gharb was less rugged than the neighboring areas to the north and south, and its strategic value stemmed from its control of Beirut's southern harbor and the road connecting Beirut with Damascus. The Druze were members of an esoteric offshoot of Isma'ili Shia Islam, the religion of the Fatimid caliphs of Egypt, and the warrior peasants who inhabited the Gharb subscribed to the faith. Shahid holds that the Tanukh entered the Gharb as Sunni Muslims and afterward adopted the Druze religion. Their leaders in the Gharb may have received and embraced the Fatimid Isma'ili da'wa (mission) as early as the late 10th century. When Beirut was captured by the Crusaders in 1110 after a three-month siege, its Muslim garrison and the Muslim tribal chiefs of the adjacent mountains who aided in its defense were massacred. The 19th-century history of Mount Lebanon's notable families by Tannus al-Shidyaq and the Sijill al-Arslani hold that the slain Tanukhids belonged to the tribe's Arslan line led by Adud al-Dawla Ali, who was killed alongside most of his family. An Arslan emir named Majd al-Dawla Muhammad survived and abandoned Sidon to the Crusaders before retiring to the Gharb where he took over the lands of his deceased kinsmen, holding them until his death in battle in 1137. The historian Kamal Salibi surmises that successive Muslim atabegs (Turkic rulers) of Damascus resettled Mount Lebanon with Arab tribesmen to buttress the frontier with the Crusader states; the most prominent of the settler families were the branch of the Tanukh led by Ali ibn al-Husayn. The early 15th-century Buhturid chronicler Salih ibn Yahya noted that Ali's grandfather was a certain Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Abi Abdallah, who was the commander of al- Bira in 1027. Salibi identifies al-Bira with the fortified town of al-Bira on the Byzantine–Islamic frontier in Anatolia where Ibrahim's clansmen and descendants had likely gained significant experience in frontier warfare; Abu Izzedin considers Salibi's theory incorrect and holds that al-Bira was the Gharb village of the same name mentioned in the Druzes' Epistle 48. Abu Izzedin further notes that the 1061 entry of the Sijill al-Arslani records the name Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Abdallah as one of the three Tanukhid emirs addressed in Epistle 50 and places his death in 1029. The historian William Harris questions Salibi's theory of the Buhturids' origins and considers it more probable that the family was already established in the Gharb and was at least distantly related to the Arslan Tanukhids who were slain in 1110, though the family may have been reinforced by Druze settlers from the northern Levant. Emirate of the Gharb=Burid and Zengid periods The Buhturid clan in the Gharb had been known as the Banu Abi Abdallah after Ali ibn al- Husayn's great-grandfather. They became known as the Banu Buhtur after the ascent of Ali ibn al-Husayn's son Nahid al-Dawla Buhtur. Clans independent of the Buhturids were settled in neighboring districts, including the Banu Ma'n (Ma'nids), which was established in the Chouf immediately south of the Gharb in 1120 and established political and marital ties with the Buhturids, and the Banu Shihab, which was established in Wadi al-Taym between Mount Lebanon and the western countryside of Damascus in 1173. Buhtur was recognized as the emir (prince or commander) of the Gharb in June 1147 by the last Burid atabeg of Damascus Mujir al-Din Abaq. The latter's written declaration, as recorded verbatim by Ibn Yahya, is the earliest known text about the Buhturids. It acknowledged Buhtur's command of the Gharb, control of its villages, ownership of their revenues and protection of its ru'asa (village chiefs) and peasants. Buhtur was likely among the frontier commanders called by Abaq to help repulse a Crusader raid against Damascus in 1148, and his Druze warriors were likely a component of the \\"many archers\\" who had come \\"from the direction of the Biqa' [Beqaa Valley] and from elsewhere\\" to defend the city during that battle referenced by the Damascene historian Ibn al-Qalanisi (d. 1160). The Buhturids' principal local rival in the Gharb during the wars with the Crusaders were the Banu Sa'dan or Banu Abi al-Jaysh, a clan of the Bedouin Banu al-Hamra from the Beqaa Valley whose headquarters was in Aramoun. The Banu Abi al-Jaysh may have also been settled in the Gharb by the Burid atabegs or had entered the area on their own initiative, but in either case were also recognized as emirs of the area. The Buhturids were consistently the stronger clan, but their struggles with the Banu Abi al-Jaysh over supremacy of the Gharb recurred throughout the Crusader period and into the Mamluk era in Mount Lebanon. The Buhturids frequently maintained profitable accommodations with the Crusader lords of Beirut and the nearby coastal town of Sidon to the south, who \\"were always willing to pay well for Buhturid good will\\", according to Salibi. At the same time, the emirs were careful to demonstrate their protection of the frontier with religious zeal to maintain financial support and avoid attacks from the Muslim rulers of Damascus. Map of medieval Levant. The Buhturids helped guard the Islamic frontier from the lords of Beirut, though they maintained a degree of relations in peacetime After the capture of Burid Damascus by Nur al-Din, the Zengid atabeg of Aleppo in 1154, and the resulting unification of the Islamic Levant under his leadership, the Buhturid emir Zahr al-Din Karama abandoned any arrangements possibly made with the Crusaders and offered his services to Nur al-Din. The latter, in turn, recognized Karama as emir of the Gharb in 1157, and granted him control over most of its villages and other villages in southern Mount Lebanon, the Beqaa Valley, and Wadi al-Taym in the form of an iqta (revenue fief), as well as the provision of forty horsemen from Damascus and whatever taxes he could levy in time of war. As a result of his support by Nur al-Din, Karama headquartered himself in the Gharb fortress of Sarhammur (modern Sarhmoul), from which he would harry the Crusaders along the coast. Karama's close proximity to Beirut disturbed its lords from the Brisebarre family and a series of raids and counter-raids between them and Karama lasted until 1166 following Gautier III of Brisebarre's sale of the fief of Beirut to the king of Jerusalem. Tensions between Beirut and the Buhturids continued until his death and the subsequent killing of his three eldest sons, both occurring sometime before 1170. Ibn Yahya holds that the sons were invited to a wedding by the lord of Beirut where they were executed. The deaths of Karama, his sons and the subsequent assault on Sarhammur by the Crusaders nearly marked the end of the Buhturids. Karama's youngest son, Jamal al-Din Hajji was a young boy and escaped Sarhammur with his mother, relocating to the Gharb village of Tirdala where Nur al-Din bestowed on him a small iqta, likely in compensation for his father's and brothers' deaths. Hajji's paternal uncle Sharaf al-Dawla Ali also survived the Crusader assault and reestablished himself in Aramoun where he founded a cadet branch of the Buhturids. Ayyubid period Nur al-Din died in 1174 and his former dependent Saladin (d. 1193), founder of the Ayyubid Sultanate, which spanned Egypt and much of the Islamic Levant by 1182. On 6 August 1187, Saladin conquered Beirut. On his approach to the town, he was welcomed by Hajji at the coastal village of Khalde, and following his capture of Beirut summoned him, declared that he had gained revenge for his family's losses and confirmed his emirate in the Gharb. Seven villages were attached to Hajji's iqta and recognized as property inherited by his father and grandfather. Saladin's son and successor in Damascus, al-Afdal, was ousted by Saladin's brother al-Adil of Egypt in 1196 and exiled to Salkhad, from which he solicited the assistance of Hajji and the Buhturids in retaking the sultanate. It is not known if Hajji responded to al-Afdal. The Crusaders recaptured Beirut in 1197 and its new lords, the House of Ibelin, were more aggressive than the Brisebarre's in asserting their influence in Beirut's countryside. Hajji likely did not fare well during their lordship and may have refused to reach accommodations with them in light of the Crusaders' killing of his family and destruction of Sarhmoul. In 1222 he received confirmation of his iqta, from the Ayyubid emir of Damascus al-Mu'azzam Isa, to whom Hajji complained at one point about his maltreatment at the hands of the Ibelins. The year of Hajji's death is not known, though his son and successor Najm al- Din Muhammad and another of his sons Sharaf al-Din Ali were slain in battle on 3 October 1242 in Keserwan, north of Beirut, by the Crusaders or local allies of the Crusaders. Before his death, Muhammad's support was sought by the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, al-Salih Ayyub, in the latter's bid to gain control of Damascus from his Ayyubid uncle al-Salih Isma'il, though it is not known if Muhammad responded. The Ayyubids of Damascus had conceded Gharb and nearby Chouf to the Crusaders in a treaty in 1240. Mamluk periodVacillations between the Mamluks, Crusaders, Mongols and Ayyubids= The Buhturid emirate in the Gharb passed to Muhammad's sons Jamal al-Din Hajji II (d. 1298) and Sa'd al-Din Khidr (d. 1314) and their father's cousin, Zayn al- Din Salih (d. 1296). Their leadership coincided with a particularly turbulent period in the Levant: the Crusaders had regained their control of the Levantine coastlands amid Ayyubid infighting, the Mamluks had toppled the Ayyubids of Egypt in 1250 and moved to wrest control of their emirates in the Levant, while the Mongols conquered and destroyed the Abbasid Caliphate in Iraq in 1258 and afterward invaded the Levant. According to Salibi, the unstable political circumstances of the region left the Buhturids to \\"have a foot in every camp and thus ingratiate all the parties concerned\\". To that end the family maintained relatively cordial ties with the Crusader lords of Beirut and Sidon, made assurances of loyalty to the Ayyubid emirs, requested negotiations with the Mamluks of Egypt and had been willing to accommodate the Mongols. Their historian Salih ibn Yahya records and dates letters recognizing their leadership of the Gharb the Ayyubid emir of Damascus al-Nasir Yusuf, the Mamluk sultan Aybak, the Mongol ruler Hulagu and the lords of Beirut and Sidon. In 1255, al-Nasir Yusuf sent a punitive expedition against the Buhturids of Gharb as a result of their duplicity. His army's regular Damascene troops and allied tribesmen from Baalbek and the Beqaa Valley were routed by the Buhturids at the village of Aytat, close to modern Aley. The following year the lord of Sidon granted Hajji II agricultural land in Damour south of Beirut, likely in compensation for his services to Sidon. In 1259 Hajji II and Salih offered their submission in Damascus to the Mongol general Kitbuqa, who recognized their holdings in the Gharb. Upon hearing of the Mamluk sultan Qutuz's campaign into Syria the two Buhturid emirs agreed that Salih would join the Egyptian camp, while Hajji II would remain with the Mongols and whichever emir was on the winning side would intercede on behalf of the other. Salih fought reputably alongside the Mamluks when they routed the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in Palestine and was pardoned by Qutuz for his initial allegiance to Kitbuqa. In the early decades of Mamluk rule, while the Crusaders continued to control the coastlands, the Mamluk government remained suspicious of Buhturid loyalties. The Buhturid emirs maintained an outward appearance as Sunni Muslims and were accepted as such by the Mamluks. Qutuz's successor Sultan Baybars confirmed their iqtas in the Gharb and employed them as auxiliaries in his engagements against the Crusaders and as intelligence gatherers. Baybars imprisoned Hajji II, Salih and Khidr for alleged collaboration with the Crusader Count of Tripoli between 1268 and 1270, but they were released by Baybars's son and successor Baraka Khan in 1278. Buhturid relations with Beirut were not abandoned, and in 1280 the lord of Beirut Humphrey of Montfort granted Salih lands near Choueifat in exchange for extraditing fugitives from Beirut who sought shelter in the Gharb and protecting Beirut from attacks by the inhabitants of the Gharb. Map of the Buhturid domains in Mount Lebanon under Mamluk rule =Incorporation into the halqa= Sultan Qalawun () confiscated the Buhturids' iqtas, along with the iqtas of other local chieftains in the coastal mountains in 1288 and following his conquest of the County of Tripoli the following year, he designated them as an income reserve for the halqa (free, non-mamluk cavalries) garrisoned in Tripoli. Khidr, the main chief of the clan at the time, passed leadership over to his son Nasir al-Din Husayn. Qalawun's son and successor al-Ashraf Khalil conquered the remaining Crusader holdouts along the coast, including Beirut and Sidon in 1291. He sought to balance his father's centralization drive with the realization that the militarily experienced peasant warriors of the Gharb and the other mountain frontier districts, who formed a key component of the Muslims' coastal defenses, were only effective under their traditional chieftains. Al-Ashraf Khalil's solution was the restoration of the Buhturids to part of their former iqtas and their incorporation into the halqa in 1292. Al-Ashraf Khalil's successor al-Nasir Muhammad restored the balance of Buhturids' former iqtas to the family in 1294. Five years later the Buhturids gave refuge to Mamluk troops fleeing advancing Mongols following the Mamluk defeat at the Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar near Homs, in contrast to the local attacks the Mamluks encountered as they crossed the Keserwan. The Buhturid emirs were assigned a certain rank and given command over a certain number of mamluk troops depending on the emir's rank. Husayn wad made emir of three while his cousin, Salih's grandson Shams al-Din Karama ibn Buhtur, was made emir of ten. In 1305 Husayn and his cousins Muhammad and Ahmad, both sons of Hajji II, participated in the government campaign against Druze, Alawite, Shia Muslim and Maronite rebels in the districts of Keserwan and Jurd, east of the Gharb. The deaths of Muhammad and Ahmad during the campaign likely strengthened Husayn's leadership position of the Buhturids. The following year the family's emirs were formally charged with protecting the harbor of Beirut, notifying the authorities of naval raids from Cyprus and assisting the government in repulsing naval raids, while Turkmen settlers were stationed in Keserwan and militarily coordinated with the Buhturids. The Buhturids were assisted and overseen by rotational halqa units from Baalbek, the administrative capital of the Northern March of Damascus Province, to which the Beirut District was subordinate. After Karama ibn Buhtur's death in 1307, Husayn obtained his rank and iqta. The Buhturids lost their iqtas in the 1313 cadastral survey of the Levant ordered by al-Nasir Muhammad. Iqtas were redistributed throughout the region, with holders being reassigned smaller iqtas in line with their rank and often in areas far from their abodes. Husayn lobbied Emir Tankiz, the Mamluk viceroy of Damascus, to restore the family to their iqtas in Mount Lebanon lest the troops in their district \\"shall perish, for it is their home and that of their men and clan, and they can benefit of no other property\\". The Mamluks agreed to leave the Buhturid iqtas intact, thereby formalizing a hereditary system of feudal land tenure which had become traditional in southern Mount Lebanon. Husayn was promoted to emir of twenty in 1314, but his iqta was not increased. Between 1306 and his retirement in 1348 Husayn helped repulse several Cypriot and Genoese raids against Beirut and in 1343 participated in an expedition against the deposed Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Ahmad in al-Karak. Husayn was succeeded by his son Zayn al-Din Salih II (d. 1377). In 1373 Salih II passed leadership of the Buhturids to his sons Shihab al-Din Ahmad (d. 1382) and Sayf al-Din Yahya (d. 1388), who ruled jointly. The former successfully ignored a Mamluk order to cut down the plums trees of the Chouf to make arrows, saving the Druze peasants of agricultural losses and forced labor; it contributed to the Bunturids' respect among the local population. Their successors mostly did not attain the prominence of the earlier Buhturids, though this may have been associated with the general decline and political instability of the Mamluk realm following the death of al-Nasir Muhammad in 1343. Yahya entered into conflict with the Mamluk viceroy of Damascus after the latter accused him of incompetence in repulsing a Genoese raid on Beirut in 1382 and demonstrating sympathies for local Shias in a dispute with Sunnis in Beirut. =Peak of power and decline= During the transition in the Mamluk Sultanate from the Turkish sultans to the Circassian sultans under Sultan Barquq in 1382, the Buhturids threw in their lot with the latter. The Turkish government was restored in 1389, during which Barquq, supported by various Syrian emirs, including the Buhturids, besieged Damascus. The Turkmens of Keserwan, who supported the Turkish sultans, used the opportunity to raid the hills around Beirut, exterminating the Abi al-Jaysh emirs and attacking the Arslans. They proceeded to raid the Buhturids in the Gharb following Barquq's reinstatement in 1390, but were unable to capture their strongholds of Ainab and Aramoun. Barquq sent against the Turkmens the Buhturids, Bedouin tribesmen from the Beqaa Valley and regular Mamluk troops, who routed them. Nonetheless, Barquq did not expand the domains of his Buhturid allies and kept the Turkmens in place in the Keserwan, possibly to avoid affording too much local power to the Buhturids or prevent their forces from being strained. The Buhturids grew their commercial enterprises, exporting silk, olive oil and soap from Beirut and forming business ties with Mamluk officials in Egypt. They reached the peak of their power during the sultanate of Barsbay (1422–1438). The sultan appointed the Buhturid emir Izz al-Din Sadaqa the mutawali (governor) of Beirut, the first member of the family to attain the post, while Ibn Yahya was promoted to the rank of amir ashrin (commander of twenty mamluks). Ibn Yahya and an emir from the rival Banu al-Hamra participated in a naval expedition against Cyprus in 1425, after which the Banu al-Hamra emir was awarded property in Beirut by Barsbay; when the emir was assassinated by a Mamluk officer, Ibn Yahya was granted the property. The Banu al-Hamra responded by assaulting the Buhturids' residence in Beirut and planning an ambush against Ibn Yahya in the Beqaa Valley. The plot was foiled and the chief of the Banu al-Hamra was arrested and executed by the viceroy of Damascus. In 1496 the paramount Buhturid emir Jamal al-Din Hajji persuaded the governor of Damascus to dismiss the Bedouin Bani al-Hansh emir Nasir al-Din Muhammad from the governorship of Beirut. Jamal al-Din was appointed in his place. Nasir al-Din Muhammad revolted in 1505 and raided Beirut, destroying Jamal al-Din's soap warehouses. The Ma'n under Emir Fakhr al-Din Uthman supported Nasir al-Din against the Buhturids. The Mamluks reinstated Nasir al-Din to Beirut in 1512. The growing influence of the Ma'ns under Fakhr al-Din Uthman came at the expense of the Buhturids' preeminence among the Druze of Mount Lebanon. Ottoman period and demise At the time of the Ottoman conquest of the Levant in 1516, the preeminent leader of the Buhturids was Sharaf al-Din Yahya, who gave homage to the Ottoman sultan Selim I in Damascus in 1516 and 1517. On the first occasion, the sultan confirmed the Buhturid iqtas in the Gharb. The Gharb-based Druze historian Ibn Sibat (d. 1520) records Yahya as the sole Druze chief to have welcomed Selim in Damascus, contrary to the chronicle of Duwayhi who lists the chiefs of the Ma'n as also having welcomed Selim, which Salibi considers doubtful. In 1518, Yahya was imprisoned by the governor of Damascus, Janbirdi al-Ghazali, for allegedly supporting the revolt of Nasir al-Din Muhammad of the Bani al-Hansh against Selim. In 1585/86 the Buhturid emir Muhammad ibn Jamal al-Din of Aramoun and his cousin Mundhir of Abeih were captured by the Ottomans and imprisoned in Constantinople for a short period. In 1633 Fakhr al-Din II, the Ma'nid chief who controlled Mount Lebanon and its environs and whose mother Sitt Nasab was a Buhturid, was captured and imprisoned by the Ottomans, who appointed in his place over the Chouf a certain Ali Alam al-Din. That year Alam al-Din moved against Fakhr al-Din's supporters and family. He massacred the entire Buhturid family in a surprise attack during a meeting with the family's leaders in their headquarters at Abeih in the Gharb. Duwayhi details Alam al-Din's slaying of the preeminent Buhturid chief Yahya al-Aqil, the lesser chiefs Mahmud, Nasir al-Din (Mundhir's nephew) and Sayf al-Din (Nasir al-Din's son), followed by the killing of their three sons in a nearby tower, \\"leaving no child to succeed them\\". Harris called the elimination of the Buhturid family the \\"extinguishing [of] an illustrious name in Lebanon's medieval history.\\" Assessment The Buhturids maintained a significant degree of local autonomy in Mount Lebanon for nearly four hundred years preceding Ottoman rule. Their rule set the stage for Ma'nid dominance of Mount Lebanon and its environs in the 16th and 17th centuries. According to Salibi, the Buhturids' staying power made Mount Lebanon \\"essentially different from other regions in Syria\\", their preservation \\"in southern [Mount] Lebanon [of] a hereditary feudal system ... was to serve later as the basis of Lebanese autonomy under the Ottomans\\".
