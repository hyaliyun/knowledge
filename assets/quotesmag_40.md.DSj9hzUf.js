Synopsis A wealthy real estate investor receives a film showing the rape and murder of his girlfriend. He hires a private detective, and shows him the film‚Äîwhich he criticizes for its poor cinematography‚Äîso that the detective can find the criminals and bring them to justice. The detective discovers that the woman is not dead, but doesn't inform his employer because the detective has romantic intentions towards her as well. His search leads him to a warehouse in the wastelands, filled with flies and sex dolls modeled on the woman. A gunshot is heard and the detective is engaged in target practice in the desert with the realtor. The realtor says he has a case he would like to be investigated, which returns the film to the first scene. Cast * Noriko Tatsumi as Sae * Y≈´ichi Minato () as J≈ç * Miki Watari () as Mina * Sh≈çhei Yamamoto () as K≈ç * Seigi [Masayoshi] Nogami () as Naka * Hatsuo Yamaya () as Doctor * Mari Nagisa () as Rie * Akaji Maro () * Taka √îkubo () * Kohei Tsuzaki () Background Director Atsushi Yamatoya was one of the group of writers on Seijun Suzuki's Branded to Kill (1967). Yamatoya had co-directed the pink film with K≈çji Wakamatsu in 1966, but Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands was his solo feature film directorial debut. He directed a few more pink films such as for Wakamatsu's production company, but found writing to be more to his taste. He often wrote anonymously for Wakamatsu during the 1960s,Sharp, p. 60. and was later regularly credited for his script work at Nikkatsu on their Roman porno series. He revisited the sex-doll theme in his script to Ch≈´sei Sone's Roman porno Love Doll Report: An Adult Toy (1975).Weisser, p. 251. Sone was one of Yamatoya's co-workers on Branded to Kill, and Yamatoya wrote several of Sone's Roman porno scripts, notably Showa Woman: Naked Rashomon, an erotic restructuring of Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950).Weisser, p. 389. Yukihiro Sawada, who worked with Yamatoya on the script for Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands, also went on to work at Nikkatsu, where he directed such Roman porno's as Sex Hunter: Wet Target (1972).Weisser, pp. 380-381. During the filming of Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands, lead actors Noriko Tatsumi and Y≈´ichi Minato worked together on director Ario Takeda's pink film Love's Milky Drops for Okura Eiga studio. This film used the same sets as Yamatoya's.Weisser, p. 254. Critical appraisal In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, the Weissers write that Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands is \\"one of the major cult films of the '60s\\". They give the film a rating of three out of four stars, noting that, due to the surrealistic and hallucinatory nature of the plot, the film may not be to all viewers' tastes. They judge the film is \\"even more eccentric\\" than director Seijun Suzuki's Branded to Kill (1967), which Atsushi Yamatoya helped write. According to the Weissers, despite several very erotic scenes, because the film emphasizes a hard-boiled mystery plot rather than sexploitation, it is not technically a pink film. Jasper Sharp writes that the film shows how versatile the pink film genre could sometimes be, calling it \\"probably the most idiosyncratic work the genre has ever produced\\", and noting that it out- does Suzuki's Branded to Kill in terms of \\"dreamlike illogicality\\". Of the plot, Sharp writes that, in spite of its disjointed nature, \\"as with Suzuki's film, there is clearly some method behind the onscreen madness\\". Sharp remarks that a comparison with Suzuki's better-known film is inevitable. Besides the sharing of a main character's name (\\"Joe\\") with the star of Suzuki's film (Joe Shishido), Sharp lists some similarities between the films: \\"the striking high-contrast monochrome cinematography; the quirky, hard-boiled performances; the hypnotic disjunction between sound and image; the use of montage to construct a surreal, alien-looking landscape that bears little resemblance to any recognisable vision of Japan; and the atonal jazz soundtrack, full of chaotic fanfares that blare out to punctuate the action.\\" Availability Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands, first known as Horror Doll, was released theatrically on October 3, 1967. It was released in VHS format in Japan in May 1997, and on DVD on August 23, 2002. Chirashis, or movie flyers, advertised this DVD release as \\"60s Sex Play\\".Sharp, p. 102.

It originally aired on ABC in the United States on 10 March 2010. Plot Following the fire, the entire Suarez family is living at Betty's apartment. Everyone, except Betty, believes that they are responsible for the fire. Justin tells Marc that he had been smoking to impress a girl, Hilda thinks Bobby and his family set the fire after she mentioned that she would like the insurance money and Ignacio tells Amanda that he wired the chandelier himself despite being told not to. At MODE, Betty tries to pitch an idea for a Lady Gaga article to Wilhelmina, but it goes wrong when she finds her dessert has leaked onto her laptop keyboard and Justin has replaced her file with a video of himself singing Bad Romance. This causes Wilhelmina to give Betty's Lady Gaga article to another editor. Betty then goes to the fire station to see if she can find out what caused the fire, but the investigation has not happened yet. One of the firemen, Jimmy, offers to move Betty's family up the list if she goes out on a date with him. Betty is reluctant as she does not like him or his taste in humor, but she later accepts. Wilhelmina runs into an old friend, Don, and with Marc's help she plans a date with him. Since Don remembers a different Wilhelmina from the woman she has become, Wilhelmina tells Marc that she needs to become 'Wanda' - a normal, nice Wilhelmina. Claire and Tyler spend some more time together and when Amanda spots them she convinces Claire to hire him as an in-house model. When Betty tells Marc she is going on a date with a fireman whom she does not like, Marc tells her to skip the appetizers and drinks and that way the date will be over quicker. On the date, Betty and Jimmy run into Wilhelmina and Don and they end up sitting at the same table. Wilhelmina and Betty pretend they are good friends in the office and Betty gets Wilhelmina to call Justin and tell him he can go to the Lady Gaga photo shoot. Later on, Wilhelmina confesses to Don that she does not like Betty, she is a bitch and she is only acting nice so he will have sex with her, which he does not mind. Hilda is nervous when Bobby's parents come to dinner, as she believes they are members of the mafia who might have burnt down her house. Hilda accuses them of starting the fire, which they strongly deny and an argument begins. Betty returns home from her date with Jimmy and tells him that she only went out with him because he was going to move her family's fire investigation up the list. Betty walks in on the argument and when everyone begins admitting to starting the fire, Jimmy tells them that the fire was started by a curling iron that was left on by Betty. Daniel sees Claire and Tyler hanging out and tells Tyler to leave Claire alone and Claire finally reveals to Daniel that Tyler is his brother. Furious at his mother, Daniel calls Amanda to see her, but she declines. It turns out she is out on a cab ride with Tyler, comforting him and reassuring him that he will have a friend in the city. Bobby tells Hilda that he has been carrying a ring around for weeks and tells her he lost her once, but he will not do it again and he proposes to her. She accepts and the family celebrates. Production \\"Fire and Nice\\" was written by Erika Johnson and directed by John Terlesky. It first aired on 10 March 2010 in the United States on ABC.

This was the EU's fourth enlargement and came into effect on 1 January of that year. All these states were previous members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and had traditionally been less interested in joining the EU than other European countries. Norway had negotiated to join alongside the other three but following the signing of the treaty, membership was turned down by the Norwegian electorate in the 1994 national referendum. Switzerland also applied for membership on 26 May 1992, but withdrew it after a negative referendum result on 6 December 1992 (and that was not changed after a second negative referendum result on 4 March 2001). Closer links The three states, plus Norway and Switzerland (which never joined due to their referendum results) began to look at stronger ties with the EU (which was the European Economic Community (EEC) before 1993) towards the end of the 1980s for three principal reasons: the 1980s economic downturn in Europe, difficulties for EFTA companies to export to the EU and the end of the Cold War.Bache, Ian and Stephen George (2006) Politics in the European Union, Oxford University Press. p543-547 After the 1970s Europe experienced a downturn which led to leaders launching of the Single European Act which set to create a single market by 1992. The effect of this was that EFTA states found it harder to export to the EEC and businesses (including large EFTA corporations such as Volvo) wished to relocate within the new single market making the downturn worse for EFTA. EFTA states began to discuss closer links with the EEC despite its domestic unpopularity. Finally, Austria, Finland and Sweden were neutral in the Cold War so membership of an organisation developing a common foreign and security policy would be incompatible with that. As that obstacle was removed, the desire to pursue membership grew stronger. EEA However membership was still domestically unpopular and the then-EEC was also uninterested in another enlargement. The EEC had begun working on the creation of a common currency and did not want another enlargement to divert their attention away from that project. Commission President Jacques Delors proposed the European Economic Area to give EFTA access to the EU's internal market without full membership. While they would not have a say in the creation of EU law, it would be easier to sell to their electorates. However businesses did not accept that the EEA members would be equal members of the single market and investment flows did not return to normal. The large manufacturers in Sweden were instrumental in pushing government policy further towards membership rather than remaining with the EEA, which the export focused industries found insufficient. The economic pressures overcame long standing opposition from the social democrat governments which saw the EU as too neo-liberal and a danger to the Nordic model. Firms were only kept within Sweden by devaluations of the Swedish krona, a strategy which was unsustainable in the long term. The EEA was damaged further with the Swiss electorate voted against it. Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden all applied for full membership of the EU and the EU agreed to enter negotiations. The EU's change of heart was also due to predicted enlargement of the EU towards countries mostly in central Europe, invited by the European Commission in 1997 and eventually completed in 2004, and hence the wealthy EFTA members would help balance the EU budget. Accession On 30 March 1994, accession negotiations concluded with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. Their accession treaties were signed on 25 June of that year. Each country held referendums on entry resulting on entry for all except Norway (its second failed referendum); * Austria - 66.6% in favour (12 June); application submitted in July 1989 * Finland - 56.9% in favour (16 October); application submitted in March 1992 (separate referendum held in √Öland) * Sweden - 52.8% in favour (13 November); application submitted in July 1991 * Norway - 47.8% in favour (28 November); application submitted in December 1992 Austria, Finland and Sweden became EU members on 1 January 1995. Sweden held their elections to the European Parliament for its MEPs later that year on 17 September. The following year, Austria held its elections on 13 October and Finland on 20 October. Remaining areas of inclusion Austria, Sweden, Finland became members on 1 January 1995, but some areas of cooperation in the European Union will apply to some of the EU member states at a later date. These are: *Eurozone (see Enlargement of the eurozone; Sweden is still not a member of the Eurozone) Impact The impact of the 1995 enlargement was smaller than most as the members were wealthy and already culturally aligned with existing members. It did however create a Nordic bloc in the Council, with Sweden and Finland backing up Denmark on environmental and human rights issues (which Austria also backed up) and the Nordic countries also called for membership of the Baltic states. As net contributors to the EU budget, they also increased the voice for budgetary reform. Before the 1995 enlargement, the EU had ten treaty languages: Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. However, due to the 1995 enlargement, two new official languages were added: Swedish (which is an official language of both Sweden and Finland) and Finnish. This enlargement began to show the problems with the EU's institutional structure, such as the size of the Commission (with minor jobs insulting the state receiving them) and the Council's voting rules meaning states representing 41% of the population could be outvoted. This resulted in the increase in the blocking minority in the Council and the loss of the larger states' second European Commissioner.

Leading a mixed force of regulars, militia, and Indians, Subercase burned much of the town and laid an ineffectual siege against the fort for five weeks between late January and early March 1705. Subercase lifted the siege after running out of provisions and gunpowder. The siege was part of a larger-scale expedition that was an attempt to repeat the highly destructive expedition led by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville in 1696. Many outlying English communities were destroyed by Subercase's men, leading to reprisal raids by the English. Fishing activities on both sides suffered for the duration of the war, which ended with the French cession of its claims to Newfoundland. Background The island of Newfoundland had been contested territory between France and England for some time before Queen Anne's War broke out in 1702. French raids during King William's War in the 1690s had completely destroyed almost all of the English settlements, including the principal port of St. John's, located on the east side of the Avalon Peninsula of southeastern Newfoundland.Prowse, p. 229 However, an English squadron led by Sir John Gibson and Sir John Morris persuaded the displaced fishermen to return and rebuild along their side of the peninsula. The Treaty of Ryswick signed in September 1697 led to the English receiving Newfoundland and the French retaining Acadia. However, the terms of the treaty became void when the French re-established their capital in Plaisance, on the Avalon Peninsula's west side.Fryer, pp. 23‚Äì4 In 1702, English Captain John Leake raided a number of French settlements in Newfoundland, but avoided Plaisance due to the presence of French warships in the harbour.Marley, p. 341‚Äì42 In 1703, Daniel d'Auger de Subercase arrived in Plaisance as the new governor and took command of a 150-man garrison and facilities that were in poor condition. After raiding Ferryland, he learned of a planned English attack on Plaisance, and prepared for the assault. It never came, as Admiral John Graydon, in what was widely seen in England as a cowardly move, called off the attack despite of having significant advantages.Charlevoix, pp. 162‚Äì63 Graydon was subsequently court martialed and dismissed from the service over his conduct in the entire campaign, which also included the failed Siege of Guadeloupe.Prowse, p. 237 French preparations In late 1704, Subercase began planning an attack against the English settlements. In addition to his garrison, he recruited Canadiens and Abenakis from the mainland and as many settlers as possible to participate in the effort. In all, his force numbered about 450 when it set out across the peninsula on 8 January 1705.Lacoursi√®re, p. 187 His corps included a company of over 100 men led by Josu√© Dubois Berthelot de Beaucours that included Jacques Testard de Montigny and the Abenaki war leader Escumbuit, both of whom had participated in Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville's 1696 raid against English settlements. While most of the company went overland, a brigantine was sent around the peninsula with some heavy guns. English defences This 1798 map of St. John's includes defences that were erected in later years. Fort William and the South Castle have been highlighted. St. John's was under the command of Lieutenant John Moody, with Lieutenant Robert Latham, a military engineer and mason, as his second in command. The principal defences of St. John's were Fort William, a stone fortification on the north side of the harbour built after the French expedition of 1696, and the South Castle, a stone fort on the south side of The Narrows which commanded the harbour entrance. Moody had put Latham in command of South Castle, while he commanded at Fort William.Prowse, p. 241 The combined defense force numbered between 50 and 60 men, with about a dozen under Latham's command. Siege The progress of the French was quite slow, due to the extreme winter cold and snow. They first captured Bay Bulls and Ferryland (small coastal communities south of St. John's) without opposition, and then moved on to St. John's, where they arrived near the town on 31 January.Marley, p. 348 Subercase had wanted to surprise the English, but the opportunity was lost when his advance guard approached within sight of the English defences (the remaining force having been delayed by poor conditions), and was driven off by cannon fire. Most of the community then fled to the protection of Fort William, and Subercase had to content himself with occupying the town while waiting for the brigantine to arrive. While he did take prisoners, he released the women and children to the fort in order to increase the burden on the English supplies. The women ended performing valuable assistance in helping with the fort's defence.Prowse, p. 243 Plaisance Governor Daniel d'Auger de Subercase After about two weeks' siege, Subercase attempted to use the divisions between Moody and Latham to diminish English morale and possibly achieve a negotiated surrender or gain control of Latham's post. He sent letters to both men, one from himself to Moody, and a second from one of the prisoners, addressed to Latham. The letter to Latham implied that a deal was in the works with Moody, and Subercase's agents tried to convince Latham to leave his works to meet with Moody. Latham refused, and Subercase's effort was ineffective.Prowse, p. 244 After 33 days of waiting, in which the brigantine with the heavy guns never appeared, Subercase, running low on munitions and provisions, lifted the siege. He destroyed the town's houses and fishing stages, and returned to Plaisance, taking with him 200 civilian captives. Subercase detached Montigny and 70 men, who continued to raid English settlements through the rest of the winter.Prowse, p. 245 Aftermath The French expedition took 1,200 prisoners in all, most of which were released due to a lack of provisions, and destroyed forty cannons, 2,000 fishing shallops,and 200 wagons, but failed to eliminate the stronghold. John Moody returned to England in late 1705, and was rewarded with a lieutenant's commission in the Coldstream Guards. He feuded with Latham, charging him with irregularities in his administration of the fortification works and poor command of South Castle, and his complaints led to Latham's recall. Subercase continued to develop the French colony in 1705, which flourished despite the war. He was rewarded for his efforts with the Order of Saint Louis and the governorship of Acadia. There he presided over Port Royal's defences, successfully fending off British sieges in 1707, but was then forced to capitulate to overwhelming force in 1710. Subercase's replacement at Plaisance, Philippe Pastour de Costebelle, negotiated an exchange of prisoners from the siege, and successfully captured St. John's in January 1709.Prowse, p. 249 France gave up claims of sovereignty over Newfoundland in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and, under Costebelle's supervision, moved the French settlers from Newfoundland to Louisbourg. The site of Fort William is a National Historic Site of Canada (marked by a plaque), and the South Castle location is part of the Signal Hill National Historic Site.

The woman with seven sons was a Jewish martyr described in 2 Maccabees 7 and other sources. Although unnamed in 2 Maccabees, she is known variously as Hannah, Miriam, and Solomonia. 2 Maccabees Shortly before the revolt of Judas Maccabeus (2 Maccabees 8), Antiochus IV Epiphanes arrested a mother and her seven sons, and tried to force them to eat pork. When they refused, he tortured and killed the sons one by one. The narrator mentions that the mother \\"was the most remarkable of all, and deserves to be remembered with special honour. She watched her seven sons die in the space of a single day, yet she bore it bravely because she put her trust in the Lord.\\"2 Maccabees 7:20, New English Bible. Each of the sons makes a speech as he dies, and the last one says that his brothers are \\"dead under God's covenant of everlasting life\\".2 Maccabees 7:36, Authorised Version. George Bull says of this verse, \\"I scarce know where to find an instance of greater faith\\" (in the resurrection and immortality) \\"and fortitude in any of our Christian martyrologies than here.\\" Sermon VIII, cited in The Old Testament According to the Authorised Version With Brief Commentary by Various Authors. The Apocryphal Books: Esdras to Maccabees (Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1902). The narrator ends by saying that the mother died, without saying whether she was executed, or died in some other way. Talmud The Talmud tells a similar story, but with refusal to worship an idol replacing refusal to eat pork. Tractate Gittin 57b cites Rabbi Judah saying that \\"this refers to the woman and her seven sons\\" and the unnamed king is referred to as the \\"Emperor\\" and \\"Caesar\\". The woman commits suicide in this rendition of the story: she \\"also went up on to a roof and threw herself down and was killed\\".Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Gittin Folio 57. Other versions Other versions of the story are found in 4 Maccabees (which suggests that the woman might have thrown herself into the flames, 17:1) and Josippon (which says she fell dead on her sons' corpsesGerson D. Cohen, Hannah and Her Seven Sons at Jewish Virtual Library). Name Various sources have proposed names for this woman. In Lamentations Rabbah she is called Miriam bat Tanhum,Tal Ilan, \\"Hannah, Mother of Seven,\\" at the Jewish Women's Archive in the Eastern Orthodox tradition she is known as Solomonia, while in the Armenian Apostolic Church she is called Shamuna,Armenian Church Liturgical Calendar July 2008 and in the Syriac Church she is known as Shmuni. She is called \\"Hannah\\" (or \\"Chana\\") in Josippon, perhaps as a result of connecting her with Hannah in the Book of Samuel, who says that the \\"barren woman bears seven,\\" (1 Samuel 2:5). Gerson Cohen notes that this occurs only in the longer Spanish version of Josippon (1510), while the shorter Mantuan version (c. 1480) continues to refer to her anonymously. Gustave Dor√©'s illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours, 1866. Legacy The woman with seven sons is remembered with high regard for her religious steadfastness, teaching her sons to keep to their faith, even if it meant execution. The Maccabees story reflects a theme of the book, that \\"the strength of the Jews lies in the fulfillment of the practical mitzvot\\".Yehoshua M. Grintz, Maccabees, Second Book of at Jewish Virtual Library It is probable that Hilary of Poitiers refers to this woman as a prophet. Hilary says \\"For all things, as the Prophet says, were made out of nothing,\\"Hilary of Poitiers. On the Trinity. Book IV, 16. and, according to Patrick Henry Reardon, he is quoting 2 Maccabees 7:28.Patrick Henry Reardon. Creation and the Patriarchal Histories: Orthodox Christian Reflections on the Book of Genesis. Conciliar Press, 2008. pp.34-35. Roman Catholic apologist Jimmy Akin uses this story to defend the Deuterocanonical books. He examines Hebrews 11:35 (\\"Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, that they might rise again to a better life\\") and notes that this hope of eternal life after torture is not found anywhere in the Protestant Old Testament, but is found in 2 Maccabees 7.James Akin, Defending the Deuterocanonicals According to Antiochene Christian tradition, the relics of the mother and sons were interred on the site of a synagogue (later converted into a church) in the Kerateion quarter of Antioch. On the other hand, tombs believed to be those of these martyrs were discovered in San Pietro in Vincoli in 1876.Taylor Marshall, The Crucified Rabbi: Judaism and the Origins of the Catholic Christianity (Saint John Press, 2009), p. 170. An additional tomb believed to be that of the woman with her seven sons is located in the Jewish cemetery of Safed. Holy Maccabean Martyrs Although they are not the same as the Hasmonean rulers called Maccabees, the woman and her sons, along with the Eleazar described in 2 Maccabees 6, are known as the \\"Holy Machabees\\" or \\"Holy Maccabean Martyrs\\" in the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. What is believed to be the Maccabees' relics - kept in the Maccabees Shrine - is venerated in St. Andrew Church, Cologne, Germany. The Orthodox Church celebrates the Holy Maccabean Martyrs on August 1. The Catholic Church also includes them in its official list of saints that have August 1 as their feast day. From before the time of the Tridentine Calendar, the Holy Maccabees had a commemoration in the Roman Rite liturgy within the feast of Saint Peter in Chains. This commemoration remained within the weekday liturgy when in 1960 Pope John XXIII suppressed this particular feast of Saint Peter. Nine years later, 1 August became the feast of Saint Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori and the mention of the Maccabee martyrs was omitted from the General Roman Calendar, since in its 1969 revision it no longer admitted commemorations.\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 132 Since they are among the saints and martyrs recognized in the Roman Martyrology,\\"Martyrologium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 ) they may be venerated by all Catholics everywhere. According to Eastern Orthodox tradition, the sons are called Abim, Antonius, Gurias, Eleazar, Eusebonus, Alimus and Marcellus,Seven Holy Maccabee Martyrs, at the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America website. though the names differ slightly among different authorities.The website of Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church in Baltimore lists them as \\"Habim, Antonin, Guriah, Eleazar, Eusebon, Hadim (Halim) and Marcellus.\\" The Seven Holy Maccabean Martyrs According to the Syriac Maronite Fenqitho (book of festal offices), the name of the mother is Shmooni while her sons are Habroun, Hebsoun, Bakhous, Adai, Tarsai, Maqbai and Yawnothon.Maronite Church, Fenqitho, v. 1, Lilyo of the Feast of Shmooni and Her Seven Sons The three Ethiopian books of Meqabyan (canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, but distinct works from the other four books of Maccabees) refer to an unrelated group of \\"Maccabean Martyrs,\\" five brothers including 'Abya, Seela, and Pantos, sons of a Benjamite named Maccabeus, who were captured and martyred for leading a guerilla war against Antiochus Epiphanes. Various mystery plays in the Middle Ages portrayed the Maccabean martyrs, and depictions of their martyrdom possibly gave rise to the term \\"macabre\\", perhaps derived from the Latin Machabaeorum.The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Fifth edition; 2002) states that the origin of \\"macabre\\" perhaps has reference to \\"a miracle play containing the slaughter of the Maccabees.\\" Volume 1, p. 1659.

Market Street in Newark, Essex County, New Jersey, United States. The church traces its origins to 1870, when a group of African Americans established the church on Broad Street in Newark, in the building of the Peddie Memorial Baptist Church. Under the leadership of the Reverend Ebenezer Bird, who had come from Virginia to lead the congregation of about 26 members, the group was officially sanctioned as a church by the Council of Baptist Churches in June 1871. Thus, the church prides itself as being the \\"first Baptist congregation founded by people of African descent.\\" The Romanesque style church building was constructed in 1866. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The church was under the stewardship of M. William Howard, Jr.. from 2000 to 2015. The old building appears to have been replaced by a housing complex, and has been replaced by a new building at 275 W. Market Street. The new building was dedicated on May 2, 1976.

At their peaks, both states controlled a large portion of the world population and produced political and cultural legacies that endure to the modern era; comparative studies largely focus on their similar scale at their pinnacles and on parallels in their rise and decline. The vast majority of studies focus on one or the other; however, the comparison of the two has attracted somewhat increased interest in the 21st century, with several studies examining the concepts of ethnicity, identity, and the views of foreigners.  History  Walter Scheidel reviewed the previous scholarship when he explained the purpose of Stanford University's Ancient Chinese and Mediterranean Empires Comparative History Project and the framework of its study in the early 21st century. Max Weber and Karl August Wittfogel both wrote works comparing the ancient Mediterranean and China; however, their studies have had little influence on later historians of the ancient world. Scheidel gives this as a contributing cause to the relative paucity of comparative studies between the two. The majority of the research in the subject area has concentrated on looking at the intellectual and philosophical history of each society. He also noted a change in the direction of research in the 2000s, with a refocusing on the \\"nature of moral, historical, and scientific thought\\" in Ancient Greece and China. Several scholars have made comparative studies of the two empires. As historian Samuel Adshead puts it, \\"Other comparisons could be made ... None, however, offers so close a parallel with Han China as the Roman empire\\". These have tended to focus on the philosophical and intellectual histories of China and the Greco- Roman world, and despite modern interest, gaps remain in the scholarship comparing Rome and the Han Empire. Scheidel notes that there are no comparative studies of high culture; there is also a virtual absence of work on \\"political, social, economic or legal history\\" of the Greco-Roman world and ancient China. However, he does note that Adshead does briefly address the issue. Wittfogel's work has come in for criticism by later historians, but his studies have not fully been supplanted by up to date theses. In modern studies of imperialism, ancient China has generally been overlooked. In Scheidel's words, \\"[compared to the study of Europe and China in the early modern period] the comparative history of the largest agrarian empires of antiquity has attracted no attention at all. This deficit is only explicable with reference to academic specialization and language barriers\\". The emergence of the United States of America as effectively the only superpower in the world after the fall of the Soviet Union in the late 20th century led to a renewed interest in empires and their study. For instance, the Roman Empire has occasionally been held up as a model for American dominance. The United States' hegemony is unprecedented in the modern system and thus the only illuminating cases can be found in pre-modern systems: ‚ÄúOne difficulty with analyzing unipolarity is that we have mainly the current case, although examining the Roman and ancient China could be illuminating.‚ÄùRobert Jervis, ‚ÄúUnipolarity: A Structural Perspective,‚Äù World Politics, 61/1, (2009): p 200. In general, with the rise of the American primacy the study of historical empires, such as Han China and Rome, increased. In the field of comparative studies between empires, not just Rome and China, Shmuel Eisenstadt's The Political System of Empires (1963) has been described as influential as it pioneered the comparative approach. The act of comparing the Roman and Han empires is aided by the amount of written evidence from both, as well as other artefactual sources. In the words of Fritz-Heiner Mutschler and Achim Mittag, \\"Comparing the Roman and Chinese empires contributes not only to understanding the trajectories along which the two civilizations developed, but also to heightening our awareness of possible analogies between the present and the past, be it with regard to America or China.\\" Recent work by Ronald A. Edwards shows how such comparisons can be helpful in understanding ancient Chinese and Roman political institutions. Society Principles of sociological examination have been identified that can be applied to the study of China and Rome. They draw on analytical and illustrative comparisons. in Political structure One of the most appealing reasons for historians to begin comparing China and Rome, is their ascent to political hegemony over the Mediterranean and East Asia. However, political comparisons by Adshead have received negative response from Chinese history experts who cite his lack of use of Chinese sources, poor support of his arguments and eagerness to take poorly supported points as facts. Nonetheless more recently, China scholars have been engaging in comparative work on political institutions between China and Rome ‚Äì see work by Ronald A. Edwards ‚Äì and between China the early modern Europe ‚Äì see work by Victoria Tin-bor Hui.  Rationale  According to Adshead's book China in World History, comparing Han China and the Roman Empire gives context and assists understanding of China's interactions and relations with other civilisations of Antiquity. In his China and the Roman Empire before Constantine, their \\"differences outweighed the similarities\\".

Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie, devoted to the Women's Guild as a ‚Äúrallying center, a place of beauty of inspiration and devotion.‚Äù  Early history  The history of Central Presbyterian Church is entwined with the history of Montclair, NJ and the history of the Presbyterian Church in the United States. Although Central's official beginning is 1837, when the first cornerstone was laid, Central's origins reach back to 1667 when four men, Jasper Crane, Robert Treat, John Treat and John Curtis successfully requested and were granted land to freely practice their religious beliefs. King Charles II of England granted ‚Äúletters patent‚Äù for a New Jersey colony. The four men, part of a group of 23 colonists, moved from Branford, Connecticut to the new colony ‚Äúat Newark on the Passaic‚Äù.  1667 - The Church in Newark  Jasper Crane, a member of the prestigious Crane family of Montclair, was one of the original founders of the church in Newark, NJ. Dedicated on January 20, 1667, the church was 36 feet by 36 feet and was located on Broad Street south of Market Street. By 1706, the church was predominantly known as a Presbyterian church. In 1708, a much larger church of stone with a steeple and a bell was built. Throughout the 1700s, the colonists traveled 8 or more miles by foot or by horse to attend the Newark church. They came from the Oranges, the ‚ÄòMountain‚Äô as Montclair was called, and Bloomfield to hear their Sunday sermon. While the Newark church was growing, the framework of the Presbyterian church was also taking shape. The first written record of the General Presbytery dates to 1705. By 1717, the First Synod, organized in Philadelphia, PA included four Presbyteries: Philadelphia, New Castle, Snow Hill and Long Island. In 1776, war broke out between the colonists and England. The colonists longed for independence from the Mother Country. Presbyterians have long been considered primarily responsible for the American Revolution in 1776: Presbyterians were very involved in the American Revolution. In numbers, they were one of the most dominant national groups. They had migrated from Scotland and from the north of Ireland because of wars with the English kings; and persecutions developed by the English rulers. The war continued for seven years until 1783, when colonists won the American Revolution. Religious freedom was integral to the newly independent, self-governing United States of America. In 1794, the first Presbyterian General Assembly began its Sessions. In 1794, desiring their own local church, Bloomfield and Cranetown residents (as Montclair was called at that time) petitioned the Presbytery for a separate society located in Bloomfield. On October 20, 1796, ‚ÄúThe Presbyterian Society of Bloomfield‚Äù was born. On May 8, 1797, the cornerstone was laid in Bloomfield. The church bell was presented by Major Nathaniel Crane. Major Bloomfield gave $140.00, and Mrs. Bloomfield donated a Bible and Psalm book for the pulpit. Isaac Dodd was elected President of the Society. Samuel Ward, Ephraim Morris, Oliver Crane and Joseph Davis were trustees. The original subscribers who agreed to hire a minister for six months included the following Cranetown residents: Oliver Crane, Stephen Fordham, William Crane, Simeon Crane, Widow Susanna Crane, Job Crane, Isaac Tomkins, Phineas Crane, Widow Dorcas Williams, David Riker, Samuel McChesney, Samuel Ward, John Vincent, Noah Crane, Jr., Noah Crane, Phebe Dod, James Gubs, Jr., Joseph Crane, John Baldwin, Nathaniel Dod, Israel Crane, Caleb Martin, Aaron Crane, Reuben Dod, Lewis Baldwin, Nathaniel Crane, Isaac Mitchell, Benjamin Crane, Eliakim Crane, Elizabeth Rouge, Thomas Force, William Holmes, Daniel Ougheltree, Levi Vincent, Cornelius Vincent, John Smith, Henry Shoemaker, John Fry, Widow Jane Crane, Zadok Crane, Samuel Tichenor, Peter Davis and Matthew Dod.  1837 ‚Äì The Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield  ‚ÄúResolved that it is expedient to build a church in this place.‚Äù According to the Session Record dated August 31, 1837, this resolution officially marked the beginning of the Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. A board of trustees and officers, elected at a meeting at the local schoolhouse, started planning for a Presbyterian society for West Bloomfield, the township informally known as Cranetown that later, in 1870, was officially recognized as Montclair. 1837 session notes Despite the severe national economic downturn in 1837, when banks failed and bankruptcies were rife across America, ‚ÄúThe Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield‚Äù was born and a new church was built. The schoolhouse already on the property was renovated. Its second story was removed and the school rooms were refinished for social meetings and Sunday school. The church was made of wood and built over these rooms. The church was located in the center of town, on a triangular-shaped block bordered by Bloomfield Avenue, Park Street and Church Street. Almost one year later to the day, on August 9, 1838, the church was formally dedicated. A $10,000 bequest by Major Nathaniel Crane provided the bedrock for the initial funding for the church. The committee and trustees included: Amos Crane, Eliam B. Crane, James Crane, Zenas S. Crane, Dr. Isaac D. Dodd, Jared E. Harrison, John Munn, Captain Joseph Munn, Cyrus Pierson, and William Smith. Decatur Harrison, an architect and Cranetown resident, designed the renovations and extensions. The church cost $3,196.95 in addition to the $400 spent for the lot. Burial plots to the cemetery adjoining the church were sold to offset the deficit. The new church boasted 71 members and pews were sold for $25-$90 per year to offset the annual budget. The Reverend Samuel Ware Fischer, son of one of New Jersey's noted preachers, was unanimously elected by Session to serve as the church's first pastor. He served from 1839 to 1849 and later served as President of Hamilton College. His initial salary, $7.00 per week, was eventually increased to $700 per year. In 1843, the chorister, Calvin S. Baldwin was paid $40 per year. The first Session members were Mathias Smith, Elias Crane, Isaac B. Wheeler, and Moses Stiles. The first clerk of Session, John Munn, remained at this post for 25 years. The early records of the church were pristinely maintained by John Munn's fastidious attention to detail.  1856 ‚Äì The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair ‚Äì ‚ÄúOld First‚Äù  By 1856, the church membership's growth dictated the necessity for a larger building. The new building was built in back of the old one with $16,000 in subscriptions, stone from local freestone quarries, and the prayers, visions and hard work of many. Miss Mary Crane, Israel Crane's daughter, donated the 1,084 pound bell tuned in the Key of G and made at the foundry of Messrs. Jones & Hitchcock in Troy, New York. Central Presbyterian Church, 1856 By 1860, there were 85 families and 196 communicants. Pews cost $65-$340 per year and were sold to the highest bidder. Although Reverend Job Foster Halsey organized the building of the new larger church, a supply pastor, the Reverend Silas Billings officiated at the building's dedication. The church's new name: The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair.  The Civil War years and beyond  From 1858 to 1861, Reverend Josiah Addison Priest served but resigned at the outbreak of the Civil War. During the Civil War years, from 1862 to 1867, the Reverend Nelson Millard served. Reverend Millard denounced slavery and supported the Union. His sermons were infused with political ideology. At one point during his service, he took a leave of absence to serve as a senior member of the Christian Commission in Richmond, Virginia. He was charged with reestablishing local government and providing food and medical services to the war-ravaged area. After the Civil War, the church's growth reflected the town's rapidly expanding population. By 1870, Montclair's population reached 2,583, and the State Legislature authorized the town's name change to Montclair. By the end of 1867, the congregation had grown to 300 members with a subscription of $4,101. The church bought the school next door and expanded the church to accommodate 700 people. In 1868, the new Township of Montclair's first board meeting was held in the church's lecture room. The church's membership continued to grow. From 1870 -1887, despite a split of members to organize the Congregational Church, 532 persons joined. The Reverend Doctor J. Romeyn Barry led the congregation at First. The growth in spirituality corresponded with an enormous increase in giving. $50,000 of debt was liquidated, a stone chapel was built on Church Street, and $10,000 was set aside to build a parsonage. The congregation was so delighted with the Reverend Dr. J.R. Barry that, after his first year of service in 1870, they presented him with a purse of gold worth $300. Upon his leaving in 1887, the church gave him a gift of $5,000. The church included a roster of townspeople who were integral to the founding and growth of Montclair. From the 17th century through World War II, the Crane family figured prominently in both Montclair's development and the church's growth. Philip Doremus, whose family ran the largest general store in Montclair during the 19th century and in 1908, helped incorporate Montclair. Doremus, who wrote a book on Montclair's history, was Superintendent of the church's Sunday school for almost 20 years. In 1856, Doremus hand wrote ‚ÄúA Constitution of the West Bloomfield Presbyterian Sabbath School‚Äù. He formed young people's societies for leadership opportunities and a social group for high school age children. He also led a discussion group for college-age adults. During this time, William B. Bradbury, the famous hymn writer and piano manufacturer used to visit the Sunday school and help teach the children the songs from his own books. When Bradbury was ill and near his death, Mr. Doremus surprised him with a large group of the Sunday school's children who filed in and marched around his room singing the hymns that Bradbury had written. In 1886, a split in the congregation concerning church policy led to the formation of the Trinity Presbyterian Church. ‚ÄòOld First‚Äô, however, continued to grow during the years 1888‚Äì1900, when Reverend William F. Junkin served. Reverend Junkin, a former Confederate officer, had served as a lieutenant colonel and chaplain on General Stonewall Jackson's staff and served at the General's funeral service. Reverend Junkin passed away in 1900. From 1901 to 1913, Reverend Llewellyn Stover Fulmer served. He was the last minister to serve ‚ÄòOld First‚Äô. During this time, Trinity and Old First were engaged in conversations concerning a possible reunification. Reverend Fulmer resigned in 1913 to help bridge the new union when Old First and Trinity reunited.  1913 ‚Äì The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair  On December 2, 1913, Trinity and Old First merged and officially became The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. Together, there were 927 members. The Reverend Edmund Melville Wylie served as the first pastor of Central. During his years of service, from 1914 to 1931, Central grew and flourished. The new congregation held services at Trinity's church, located on the northwest corner of Midland and Claremont Avenues. Central supported missionary work both domestically and around the globe. So prominent was the mission work of Central that the missionaries‚Äô names were featured on the cover of the weekly Sunday service program. Following is a list of the missionaries supported by Central: *Mr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary: Elat Station, West Africa *Miss F. Elizabeth Harris: Dry Creek, West Virginia *Rev. and Mrs. Alfred William Moore: Mainpuri, India *Rev. Giacinto J. Reale, Italian Mission: Montclair, New Jersey Members engaged in mission work: *Rev. Thomas F. Carter: Nanhsuchou, China *Dr. Edward Mills Dodd: Tabriz, Persia *Peter Carter Speers: Lahore, India *John L. Mott: Nagpur, India *James L. Speers, Jr.: Nanking, China *Dr. and Mrs. William S. Dodd: Konia, Turkey *Marjorie C. Geary: Czechoslovakia *Dr. Wilson Farnsworth Dodd: Constantinople, Turkey *Marian Crawford: Smith, Kentucky *Florence Goodall: Smith, Kentucky Mr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary were the first missionaries supported by Central. In 1903, they went to Cameroon, Elat, West Africa. Although Mr. McCleary died six months after they arrived in West Africa, Mrs. McCleary stayed and taught more than 6,000 boys. Central supported domestic missions as well. Miss F. Elizabeth Harris rode on horseback over 1,000 miles per year to help the community in Dry Creek, Virginia. Other missions included the Mountaineers School at Rock Creek, Tennessee; the Spring Street Neighborhood House in New York City. The Presbyterian Italian Mission in Montclair provided Italian immigrants with sermons in their native language. Central's Women's Guild was renowned for its philosophy of service and good works. During World War I, Central's Women's Guild aided the relief agencies. The Guild paid Mrs. McCleary's salary in West Africa. They formed a sewing department to make clothes for local charities and missionary requests. ‚ÄòThe Cut and Contrive Club‚Äô made dresses and coats for children, new suits and clothing for the missionaries. During World War I, the Guild partnered with the Red Cross to sew pajamas, shirts for the wounded, pneumonia jackets, gauze masks and bandages. While Pastor Wylie was away, after having been called to serve at a YMCA training camp in the South, the Guild formed a branch called ‚ÄòGroup Work‚Äô. The groups were divided into districts of 50 families each and the women acted as Big Sisters reporting illness or trouble.‚ÄúA Celebration of Women in Central Presbyterian Church: Past and Present‚Äù, a paper presented to the Women's Guild in 1977, Tate Elder.  1922 - The Central Presbyterian Church at 46 Park Street  By 1916, Central had outgrown its building. The ‚ÄòCommittee of Twelve‚Äô was appointed and chose the site for the church currently at the corner of Park Street and Claremont Avenue. The architectural design company Carrere and Hastings, Shreve, Lamb and Blake Associates was hired. This company also designed the New York Public Library. The new church, the same church worshipped in today, is an architectural treasure embodying the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. There is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony.

Reverend Wylie decried the enrollment in 1922 at 400 ‚Äúis but half the number that a School commensurate with the membership of our Church should comprise.‚Äù On October 15, 1922, the new Central Presbyterian Church held its dedication ceremony. At 10:30 a.m., the Gloria Trumpeters, using long trumpets and dressed in ankle-length white robes, stood outside the church portals and played ‚ÄúA Mighty Fortress is Our God‚Äù. The doors opened and the congregation filed in. Reverend Wylie, the new associate pastor Reverend Rock and the officers met at the old church, held a brief service, and then marched to the new building. Before entering the building, they stood outside and sang two verses of the 100th Psalm, ‚ÄúAll people that on earth do dwell.‚Äù When they marched down the aisles, the entire congregation rose and sang the last two verses with them. Dr. Cleland B. McAfee from the McCormick Theological Seminary preached the sermon aptly named ‚ÄúThe Glory of the House.‚Äù The church celebrated with a week's worth of activities including an organ recital, a Young People's Musical Service, and several special services. Reverend Wylie called the church and adjoining church house ‚Äúa factory‚Äù. There was always something going on. The church was a place where the congregation enjoyed spiritual education, work and play. The church was both a religious retreat and community center ‚Äì a very different model than the church the forefathers probably had in mind! There was a gym for basketball, badminton, evening parties and dancing; an auditorium-sized stage for plays and programs, and a kitchen for church suppers. The four manual Skinner organ was a gift from the Women's Guild in memory of Mrs. Wylie, the minister's wife, who died unexpectedly in 1919. From 1927 to 1937, Carl F. Mueller was appointed organist and then Minister of Music. Mueller was already recognized as a masterful organist in his native hometown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mueller developed a volunteer choir and steadily over the course of several years built the choir from forty voices to several different choirs totaling 100 voices. Through Mueller's inspired direction, Central's choir became very well known throughout New Jersey and even sang on radio broadcasts. In 1931, Mueller united the Central Choir with the State Teachers College in Montclair to form the Montclair Acapella Choir. Mr. Mueller wrote and published much of the music sung by the choir. Mueller's choral work, \\"Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God\\", sold nearly 2 million copies. In 1931, citing ill health, Pastor Wylie resigned. The Great Depression was in full force. Central was not immune to the financial upheaval. The budget dropped by 25% causing much consternation and anxiety. In April, 1932, the Reverend Morgan Phelps Noyes came to Central. A much loved pastor, he served until 1957. By 1937, the church was back on sound financial footing, the manse at 66 Park Street was razed and a house on North Mountain Avenue was leased for the pastor and his family. The membership had grown to 1,018 and the local and international mission work continued. Reverend Noyes‚Äô service at Central encompassed World War II. During this time, many women from our church volunteered with the Red Cross working in local canteens, aiding nurses, visiting V.A. hospitals and working overseas. After the war, two Central Presbyterian church women were awarded Gold Stars for their work. When soldiers on leave visited Central, they were often invited for a home-cooked meal. Church members quite regularly corresponded with the soldiers. A scrapbook with thank you letters from the soldiers was kept by the church. During these years, the Women's Guild continued to meet one Tuesday each month for Guild Day. The women sewed in the morning, ate a luncheon for 25 cents, met for an afternoon business meeting and then enjoyed a program. Speakers on missions and social issues both local and national dominated the programs.  Post World War II  In 1950, Central ordained its first women elders. Central member Edna Thistle, the first woman to serve communion at Central, wisely commented: ‚ÄúThe significance of this victory for women was not the gaining of power per se but, rather, an affirmation of the responsibility they had assumed through their faithful work, their study, their training, their giving and their worship.‚Äù The first women elders were Lois Dean, Nellie Dodd Speers, and Rose Marzano. Two years later, Lila Speers, Lillian Applegate and Maude Dean were ordained. In the early 1950s, due to restrictive budgets and domestic needs, financial support for missionary work abroad had to be curtailed. Central's strong commitment to mission found a new outlet in giving: the nationally based Presbyterian Major Mission Fund. One third of the money went to special domestic and international programs, one third was targeted by donors for ‚Äòuse wherever the need was greatest‚Äô, and the balance was given without restrictions. Central was known to have exceeded its goal by $20,000 and to have given seven times the national per capita average.  The 1960s  From 1958 to 1965, Reverend Paul Conine served at Central. At the time, budgetary problems caused a series of cutbacks for the church. In 1966, Reverend Doctor Roger Hubert was called to serve Central. Considered a breath of fresh air by many, he brought many major contemporary issues to the attention of the church membership. Questions about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, civil rights, women's rights and civil liberties, however, caused much dissension among church members, resulting in a large number of members leaving the church. Reverend Hubert remained until 1975. Following a period of poor health, he resigned, went to law school and joined the staff at Seton Hall Law School.  The latter 20th century  From 1977 through 1987, Reverend Ernie Fogg served as Senior Pastor at Central. Before coming to Central, Reverend Fogg had balanced a career between leading mission efforts in Indonesia and running programs at Presbyterian headquarters at 475 Riverside Avenue in New York city. While at Central, Reverend Fogg mentored a dozen Princeton Theological Seminary students. He was involved with the Montclair Clergy Association, the Montclair Rotary, and Senior Care and Activity Center. Reverend Fogg was National President of the American Leprosy Association. At Central, Ernie excelled at both pastoral calling and organizing memorable worship services. During his time here, a successful Capital Campaign was held to update the kitchen and restore the steeple. Early in his ministry, Central was one of the leading churches in New Jersey. Central supported the UPC's Major Mission Fund to create educational and medical mission programs here and overseas. His wife, C‚Äôlee Fogg, was very active in the church, and the couple were very popular with the congregation. By the 1980s, Central women were leading Newark presbytery committees. Alice Price, Bessie Marsh, Carole Brand and Mary Lee Fitzgerald led these various committees. Alice Price served as Central's first woman Clerk of Session. From 1985 to 1986, she also served as moderator of the Newark Presbytery. The Sunday school, led by Connie Thurber, Marlene French, Terye McAnally and Liz Ploth, was brimming with creativity, energy and devotion. From 1976 - 2009, Central's Choir was led by the inimitable Gaylord French whose great talents and musical artistry filled the church with truly inspirational music. For 33 years, Gaylord directed the choir and played his classical repertoire. Through the years, Central has not only attracted superb singers, but has been the church home to many fine musicians. A man immersed in music, Gaylord took advantage of the many talented musicians in the congregation and organized the Family Ensemble, a group who would play periodically at church services. He chose a repertoire that showed off the musical talents of many in solos performed with the choir on any given Sunday. Gaylord played for the Christmas Pageant and the beloved annual Talent Show. He also performed solo and played with guest musicians for many Sunday afternoon recitals at the church. It's impossible to mention Gaylord without giving due attention to his wife Marlene, who also contributed greatly to the Women's Guild. In 1988, Reverend Dr. N. Barry Dancy served as interim pastor to provide continuity while Central searched for a new pastor. During his year of service, a group of young people from our church went to England to share the news of Christ's peace. A photo exhibit at William Patterson College used Central's church building as an outstanding example of American Renaissance church architecture in New Jersey. In October, Central's sanctuary building was selected for registry as a national historic landmark. From 1989 ‚Äì 1996, Reverend Charles Henderson served as pastor. His wife, Reverend Katherine Henderson served as Parish Associate. During his tenure, the church established a Long-Range Committee to help develop a three-year plan to meet the needs of the physical structure of the church. Additionally, the Committee studied and ultimately recommended that Central institute a new system of church government combining the work of Session and the Board of Trustees into one governing body. In 1994, a successful Capital Campaign raised $20,000 more than its target goal of $350,000 for building improvements. In August, 1997, the Reverend Dr. Richard Crocker began his five and a half year tenure as Pastor of Central. Dr. Crocker's wry, sophisticated sermons, peppered with comments on modern life and the travails of raising a family, were a big hit with the congregation. His wife Carolyn also had a great influence on the Sunday school and the women's group she organized and led. In 1998, a three-year campaign raised $360,000. A second fund-raiser collected enough money to pay off the mortgage on the manse and for the first time in many years, Central was debt free.  The Early Years of the 21st Century  In 2000, under the direction of Central's two seminarians, David Baker and Mark Hanna, Central launched a new Young Adult program and ministry. In 2002, seminarian Patricia Hill was hired as Director of Youth and Family Ministry. Dr. Crocker shepherded the congregation through the dark days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks; but in 2002 he accepted a position as Dean of the Tucker Foundation and Chaplain of Dartmouth College. Two interim pastors served Central while the congregation searched for a permanent pastor. Reverend Ray Vande Giessen and Reverend Phyllis Zoon worked tirelessly to keep our congregation on course while we searched for a new pastor. Their efforts were greatly appreciated. In 2004, Reverend Laurie McNeill became Central's first female Senior Pastor and Head of Staff. Seminarian Mark McDowell replaced Tricia Hill as Director of Youth and Family Ministry. During this time, the local Senior Care and Activities Center's new facility was finally completed and after 27 years, moved their space out of Central to their new building. In 2014, Reverend David C. Noble became the church's senior pastor, and currently serves in this position.  Central Presbyterian Church pastors and dates of service  Called Pastors: 1839 - 1843: Rev.

The ritual involves an antiphonic recitation of prayer by participants joined in a circle, usually around an altar in a temple. Mormon prayer circles were once organized by local congregations on a monthly schedule, but in the late 1970s were restricted only to temples. Origin of Mormon prayer circles Prayer circles were common in the Protestant revivals of the Second Great Awakening that occurred in the youth of Smith. Ritual circles were also practiced in Freemasonry,George S. Tate, ‚ÄúThe Prayer Circle,‚Äù at http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Prayer_Circle. See also, Albert G. Mackey‚Äôs, ‚ÄúAn Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, 2 vols, rev. ed, [NY: The Masonic History Co., 1920) 2:577]. to which Smith had been initiated in 1842 by Abraham Jonas. Early Mormons practiced conventional Protestant-type prayer circles at least as early as 1833. On May 4, 1842, Smith met with nine other men and performed the first endowment ceremony. It is not clear whether this ceremony included a prayer circle. However, prayer circles became the main purpose of meetings of the Anointed Quorum beginning on May 26, 1843. Women were first included in the ceremony on September 28, 1843. Within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints After Smith's death, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) continued to practice prayer circles in its temples. In addition, local stake and ward prayer circles were organized and conducted until May 3, 1978, when the church's First Presidency announced that all prayer circles should be discontinued except those performed in a temple as part of the endowment. The reason for this change is not known, but could have resulted in part from the growth of the LDS Church, and the fact that prayer circles were usually organized by a member of the First Presidency or the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Within Mormon fundamentalism Amongst some Mormon fundamentalists, such as the Apostolic United Brethren, prayer circles within temples, endowment houses, and homes are still common.

He played for the San Antonio Riders of the WLAF, and the Sacramento Gold Miners of the CFL. Thieneman played collegiately at the University of Louisville, where he was an honorable mention All-American. Later, he returned to Kentucky and took over the family business which included development and real estate. As a Republican he also ran for the Mayor of Louisville, the Kentucky State House of Representatives and the Kentucky State Senate, losing all three times. He has also been accused of bribery, perjury and assault. Most of those allegations were found as not guilty. Early years Thieneman was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. He attended Bishop David High School where he lettered three years in football as a defensive end. During his senior year, he earned All-County, All-District and All-State honors. Following graduation, Thieneman enrolled at the University of Louisville after being recruited to play college football for the Cardinals by coach Bob Weber. He played his first two seasons as a backup linebacker before being redshirted in 1985 due to a shoulder injury. Under coach Howard Schnellenberger, Thieneman returned to the football field in 1986, making the switch to the defensive tackle position. As a junior, he recorded 53 tackles (40 solo) and earned honorable mention All-America honors by the Associated Press, which also named him to the All-South Independent team. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in business management. Professional career In 1988, Thieneman signed as an undrafted free agent with the Dallas Cowboys as a defensive end, but did not appear in a single regular season game and was released from the offseason practice squad. He played professional football in Canada for four years, ending his career in the Canadian Football League with the Sacramento Gold Miners. Political career After football, Thieneman began working in the family real estate business and obtained a real estate license. Thieneman took over operation of the family business and established his own development company. His developments include trailer parks, family- based subdivisions, low-income apartments and office complexes in the Greater Louisville Metro area. Thieneman is one of the largest owners of vacant property on Dixie Highway. Thieneman ran in the Republican primary for Congress in Kentucky's 3rd congressional district in 2008. In May 2010, Thieneman ran for Mayor of Louisville in the Republican primary but lost to Hal Heiner. Heiner would eventually lose narrowly to current Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. In Spring of 2012, Thieneman filed to run for 37th district's state senate seat, narrowly defeating former Metro Councilman Doug Hawkins in the Republican primary in May. Thieneman lost by a wide margin in the general election to incumbent Democrat State Senator Perry Clark. Despite numerous attempts, Thieneman has never won election to any public office. Bribery In 2010, during his campaign for Louisville mayor, Thieneman participated in an interview with the Courier Journal editorial board to seek the newspaper's endorsement. In the interview, Thieneman admitted to bribing a county official in order to get approval for a trailer park from the local planning commission despite heavy opposition from nearby residents. The request was granted by the planning commission, and a trailer park was built along a narrow piece of land in the middle of a middle-class neighborhood. Residency In the fall of 2012, it was alleged by a local blog that Thieneman did not reside in the district in which he filed to represent. Thieneman has repeatedly denied that he lives outside the district, but depositions by citizens, photographic evidence and voting records suggest Thieneman has multiple residences in Jefferson County, Kentucky. The residence in question is the location of a Thieneman-owned commercial business - a self-storage locker business. In October 2012, a lawsuit was filed by district resident Robert Walker that challenged Thieneman's residency. The suit alleged Thieneman did not live in the 37th district and therefore was not a legal candidate. Judge Charles Cunningham ordered on November 2, 2012, that Thieneman produce utility bills from his supposed residence at the storage business as well as a home Thieneman owns on Brownsboro Road. The utility bills were supposed to have proven exactly where Thieneman was living, but the judge's order was never fulfilled by Thieneman and the case was passed. Personal life Thieneman is one of the original founders of the Mint Jubilee, a Kentucky Derby-themed charity event that raises money for The James Brown Cancer Center in Louisville. The event has been mired in controversy and was alleged to have misappropriated funds originally meant for the charity. In 2013, Thieneman was charged with assault and wanton endangerment when he was accused of choking his ex-girlfriend during an argument. The woman was granted an Emergency Protective Order of restraint from Thieneman. He was again arrested on May 29, 2014 for intimidating his ex-girlfriend, violating his EPO/DVO and retaliating against a participant in a legal process. Thieneman was eventually found not guilty of these assault charges. Thieneman and his wife, Nikki, appeared on multiple episodes of the 5th season of 90 Day Fiance as the friend of cast member David Toborowsky. Chris and Nikki have two young children together ‚Äî Ila and Ira.

He showed the following main property: the order of an ordinary differential equation can be reduced by one if it is invariant under one- parameter Lie group of point transformations. This observation unified and extended the available integration techniques. Lie devoted the remainder of his mathematical career to developing these continuous groups that have now an impact on many areas of mathematically based sciences. The applications of Lie groups to differential systems were mainly established by Lie and Emmy Noether, and then advocated by √âlie Cartan. Roughly speaking, a Lie point symmetry of a system is a local group of transformations that maps every solution of the system to another solution of the same system. In other words, it maps the solution set of the system to itself. Elementary examples of Lie groups are translations, rotations and scalings. The Lie symmetry theory is a well-known subject. In it are discussed continuous symmetries opposed to, for example, discrete symmetries. The literature for this theory can be found, among other places, in these notes.  Overview = Types of symmetries  Lie groups and hence their infinitesimal generators can be naturally \\"extended\\" to act on the space of independent variables, state variables (dependent variables) and derivatives of the state variables up to any finite order. There are many other kinds of symmetries. For example, contact transformations let coefficients of the transformations infinitesimal generator depend also on first derivatives of the coordinates. Lie-B√§cklund transformations let them involve derivatives up to an arbitrary order. The possibility of the existence of such symmetries was recognized by Noether. For Lie point symmetries, the coefficients of the infinitesimal generators depend only on coordinates, denoted by Z.  Applications  Lie symmetries were introduced by Lie in order to solve ordinary differential equations. Another application of symmetry methods is to reduce systems of differential equations, finding equivalent systems of differential equations of simpler form. This is called reduction. In the literature, one can find the classical reduction process, and the moving frame-based reduction process. Also symmetry groups can be used for classifying different symmetry classes of solutions.  Geometrical framework = Infinitesimal approach  Lie's fundamental theorems underline that Lie groups can be characterized by elements known as infinitesimal generators. These mathematical objects form a Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators. Deduced \\"infinitesimal symmetry conditions\\" (defining equations of the symmetry group) can be explicitly solved in order to find the closed form of symmetry groups, and thus the associated infinitesimal generators. Let Z=(z_1,\\\\dots,z_n) be the set of coordinates on which a system is defined where n is the cardinal of Z. An infinitesimal generator \\\\delta in the field \\\\mathbb{R}(Z) is a linear operator \\\\delta : \\\\mathbb{R}(Z)\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}(Z) that has \\\\mathbb{R} in its kernel and that satisfies the Leibniz rule: :\\\\forall (f_1,f_2) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}(Z)^2, \\\\delta f_1 f_2 = f_1 \\\\delta f_2 + f_2 \\\\delta f_1. In the canonical basis of elementary derivations \\\\left{\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_1},\\\\dots,\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_n}\\\\right }, it is written as: :\\\\delta = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\xi_{z_i}(Z) \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_i} where \\\\xi_{z_i} is in \\\\mathbb{R}(Z) for all i in \\\\left{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\right}.  Lie groups and Lie algebras of infinitesimal generators  Lie algebras can be generated by a generating set of infinitesimal generators as defined above. To every Lie group, one can associate a Lie algebra. Roughly, a Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} is an algebra constituted by a vector space equipped with Lie bracket as additional operation. The base field of a Lie algebra depends on the concept of invariant. Here only finite-dimensional Lie algebras are considered.  Continuous dynamical systems  A dynamical system (or flow) is a one- parameter group action. Let us denote by \\\\mathcal{D} such a dynamical system, more precisely, a (left-)action of a group (G,+) on a manifold M: : \\\\begin{array}{rccc} \\\\mathcal{D} : & G\\\\times M & \\\\rightarrow & M \\\\ & u \\\\times Z & \\\\rightarrow & \\\\mathcal{D}( u,Z) \\\\end{array} such that for all point Z in M: * \\\\mathcal{D}(e,Z)=Z where e is the neutral element of G; * for all ( u, \\\\hat{ u}) in G^2, \\\\mathcal{D}( u,\\\\mathcal{D}(\\\\hat{ u},Z))=\\\\mathcal{D}( u+\\\\hat{ u},Z). A continuous dynamical system is defined on a group G that can be identified to \\\\mathbb{R} i.e. the group elements are continuous.  Invariants  An invariant, roughly speaking, is an element that does not change under a transformation.  Definition of Lie point symmetries  In this paragraph, we consider precisely expanded Lie point symmetries i.e. we work in an expanded space meaning that the distinction between independent variable, state variables and parameters are avoided as much as possible. A symmetry group of a system is a continuous dynamical system defined on a local Lie group G acting on a manifold M. For the sake of clarity, we restrict ourselves to n-dimensional real manifolds M=\\\\mathbb{R}^n where n is the number of system coordinates.  Lie point symmetries of algebraic systems  Let us define algebraic systems used in the forthcoming symmetry definition. = Algebraic systems = Let F=(f_1,\\\\dots,f_k)=(p_1/q_1,\\\\dots,p_k/q_k) be a finite set of rational functions over the field \\\\mathbb{R} where p_i and q_i are polynomials in \\\\mathbb{R}[Z] i.e. in variables Z=(z_1,\\\\dots,z_n) with coefficients in \\\\mathbb{R}. An algebraic system associated to F is defined by the following equalities and inequalities: : \\\\begin{array}{ccc} \\\\left{ \\\\begin{array}{l} p_1(Z)= 0, \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\ p_k(Z)=0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right.& \\\\mbox{and} & \\\\left{ \\\\begin{array}{l} q_1(Z) eq 0, \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\ q_k(Z) eq 0. \\\\end{array} \\\\right. \\\\end{array} An algebraic system defined by F=(f_1,\\\\dots,f_k) is regular (a.k.a. smooth) if the system F is of maximal rank k, meaning that the Jacobian matrix (\\\\partial f_i / \\\\partial z_j) is of rank k at every solution Z of the associated semi-algebraic variety. = Definition of Lie point symmetries = The following theorem (see th. 2.8 in ch.2 of ) gives necessary and sufficient conditions so that a local Lie group G is a symmetry group of an algebraic system. Theorem. Let G be a connected local Lie group of a continuous dynamical system acting in the n-dimensional space \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Let F: \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^k with k \\\\leq n define a regular system of algebraic equations: : f_i(Z)=0 \\\\quad \\\\forall i \\\\in {1,\\\\dots,k}. Then G is a symmetry group of this algebraic system if, and only if, : \\\\delta f_i(Z)=0 \\\\quad \\\\forall i\\\\in {1,\\\\dots,k} \\\\mbox{ whenever } f_1(Z)=\\\\dots=f_k(Z)=0 for every infinitesimal generator \\\\delta in the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} of G. = Example = Consider the algebraic system defined on a space of 6 variables, namely Z=(P,Q,a,b,c,l) with: : \\\\left { \\\\begin{array}{l} f_1(Z)=(1-cP)+bQ + 1, \\\\ f_2(Z)=aP - lQ +1. \\\\end{array} \\\\right . The infinitesimal generator : \\\\delta = a(a-1) \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial a} + (l+b)\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial b}+ (2ac-c)\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial c}+(-aP+P)\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial P} is associated to one of the one-parameter symmetry groups. It acts on 4 variables, namely a,b,c and P. One can easily verify that \\\\delta f_1 = f_1 -f_2 and \\\\delta f_2 = 0. Thus the relations \\\\delta f_1 = \\\\delta f_2 = 0 are satisfied for any Z in \\\\mathbb{R}^6 that vanishes the algebraic system.  Lie point symmetries of dynamical systems  Let us define systems of first- order ODEs used in the forthcoming symmetry definition. = Systems of ODEs and associated infinitesimal generators = Let d\\\\cdot / dt be a derivation w.r.t. the continuous independent variable t. We consider two sets X=(x_1,\\\\dots,x_k) and \\\\Theta = (\\\\theta_1,\\\\dots,\\\\theta_l). The associated coordinate set is defined by Z=(z_1,\\\\dots,z_n)=(t,x_1,\\\\dots,x_k,\\\\theta_1,\\\\dots,\\\\theta_l) and its cardinal is n=1+k+l. With these notations, a system of first-order ODEs is a system where: : \\\\left { \\\\begin{array}{l} \\\\dfrac{d x_i}{dt} = f_i(Z) \\\\mbox{ with } f_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}(Z) \\\\quad \\\\forall i \\\\in {1,\\\\dots,k}, \\\\ \\\\dfrac{d \\\\theta_j}{dt} = 0 \\\\quad \\\\forall j \\\\in {1,\\\\dots,l} \\\\end{array} \\\\right . and the set F=(f_1,\\\\dots,f_k) specifies the evolution of state variables of ODEs w.r.t. the independent variable. The elements of the set X are called state variables, these of \\\\Theta parameters. One can associate also a continuous dynamical system to a system of ODEs by resolving its equations. An infinitesimal generator is a derivation that is closely related to systems of ODEs (more precisely to continuous dynamical systems). For the link between a system of ODEs, the associated vector field and the infinitesimal generator, see section 1.3 of. The infinitesimal generator \\\\delta associated to a system of ODEs, described as above, is defined with the same notations as follows: : \\\\delta = \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(Z) \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_i}\\\\cdot = Definition of Lie point symmetries = Here is a geometrical definition of such symmetries. Let \\\\mathcal{D} be a continuous dynamical system and \\\\delta_\\\\mathcal{D} its infinitesimal generator. A continuous dynamical system \\\\mathcal{S} is a Lie point symmetry of \\\\mathcal{D} if, and only if, \\\\mathcal{S} sends every orbit of \\\\mathcal{D} to an orbit. Hence, the infinitesimal generator \\\\delta_\\\\mathcal{S} satisfies the following relation based on Lie bracket: : [\\\\delta_\\\\mathcal{D}, \\\\delta_\\\\mathcal{S}] = \\\\lambda \\\\delta_\\\\mathcal{D} where \\\\lambda is any constant of \\\\delta_\\\\mathcal{D} and \\\\delta_\\\\mathcal{S} i.e. \\\\delta_\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\lambda = \\\\delta_\\\\mathcal{S} \\\\lambda = 0. These generators are linearly independent. One does not need the explicit formulas of \\\\mathcal{D} in order to compute the infinitesimal generators of its symmetries.  Example  Consider Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst's logistic growth model with linear predation, where the state variable x represents a population. The parameter a is the difference between the growth and predation rate and the parameter b corresponds to the receptive capacity of the environment: : \\\\dfrac{dx}{dt}= (a-bx)x, \\\\dfrac{da}{dt}=\\\\dfrac{db}{dt}=0. The continuous dynamical system associated to this system of ODEs is: : \\\\begin{array}{rccc} \\\\mathcal{D}: & (\\\\mathbb{R},+) \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^4 & \\\\rightarrow & \\\\mathbb{R}^4 \\\\ & (\\\\hat{t},(t,x,a,b)) & \\\\rightarrow & \\\\left(t+\\\\hat{t}, \\\\frac{axe^{a\\\\hat{t}}}{a-(1-e^{a\\\\hat{t}})bx}, a, b\\\\right). \\\\end{array} The independent variable \\\\hat{t} varies continuously; thus the associated group can be identified with \\\\mathbb{R}. The infinitesimal generator associated to this system of ODEs is: : \\\\delta_\\\\mathcal{D} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + ((a-bx)x)\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\cdot The following infinitesimal generators belong to the 2-dimensional symmetry group of \\\\mathcal{D}: : \\\\delta_{\\\\mathcal{S}_1} = -x \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}+b\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial b}, \\\\quad \\\\delta_{\\\\mathcal{S}_2} = t\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}-x\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}-a\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial a} \\\\cdot  Software  There exist many software packages in this area. For example, the package liesymm of Maple provides some Lie symmetry methods for PDEs. It manipulates integration of determining systems and also differential forms. Despite its success on small systems, its integration capabilities for solving determining systems automatically are limited by complexity issues. The DETools package uses the prolongation of vector fields for searching Lie symmetries of ODEs. Finding Lie symmetries for ODEs, in the general case, may be as complicated as solving the original system.

Church is a historic church located at High and Court Streets in Newark, New Jersey. Built in 1850 by architect John Welch and dedicated in 1854, it was originally called the High Street Presbyterian Church until 1926, when it was briefly disbanded. It was re-established as Bethel AME Church before being renamed Saint James' AME Church. History Incorporated in 1842, and located on Green Street in Newark, it was formed under Rev. C. Birch, however, it was briefly disbanded in 1926 then re- established as Saint James AME Church. Church services were held in various places before settling at 94 Union Street. In January 1945, the church moved to its present building on High Street (now Martin Luther King Boulevard). Prior to the acquisition of the church on Union Street, the congregation worshipped at various locations. The present church had been the Old High Street Presbyterian Church. In August of that same year, the first marriage in Saint James at the new location on High Street, was that of the late Mr. John C. Reynolds and Mrs. Alberta Reynolds., and to this union, three daughters and one son were born. James Ballard was a dedicated worker as the church sexton and custodian for 35 years before retiring in 1980. A roster lists the names of all the prior pastors to lead Saint James. However, only one name on that list had the honor of being elected and consecrated the 105th Bishop of the AME Church. Bishop Vernon Randolph Byrd was elected from the pulpit of Saint James in 1984. Saint James was placed on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places in 1972. By gaining landmark status and eligibility for monies designated for historic preservation, the church received a substantial grant of $1.3 million in 2000 awarded by the New Jersey Historic Trust. During the beautification work, services were held at nearby Arts High School for about nine months or so. Architecture The church was built to represent a florid Gothic structure in the pointed style of the 14th century built wholly stone from the Little Falls by renowned architect John Welch. It is said to be one of his first projects upon coming to the United States. The interior presents a spacious and cheerful room, without galleries, relieved of any sepulchral effect by the unobtrusively rich stained glass windows, which temper the atmosphere into a soft mellow tone, without excluding too much light. The pews are invitingly arranged and cushioned with red, the carpets being of the same general tone. The pulpit is of elaborately carved oak, the wood work of the organ loft over the front vestibule and seats being of the same material. In the evening it is lighted with gas from side brackets, and gilt candelabra, with five burners each, rising at convenient intervals between the pews. The church is designed in a rectangular shape with the placement of the tower, piers and chancel in a style similar to the English fourteenth century decorative period. The building is constructed entirely of a hand-cut stone in an approximate facsimile of a Flemish bond. A centrally located tower on the facade is Norman in style with some early English elements. The building is on an east-west axis and has its front doors on a level with the sidewalk. The nave and rear addition reach back and down the steep hill so that the building appears to be quite large. The interior of the church, however, is not very large. The addition was a rear lecture hall built in 1890, beginning at the end of the side walls. Even though the rear building appears to be a large transept, it is in fact a separate building. The original part of the building extends from the front tower to the rear wall of the nave which serves as a central pulpit area. The entire rear of the building is in effect a separate building and contains rooms used for offices with a large lecture room in the upper stories that run at a high angle to the church nave. This building is constructed of brick and is faced with a brownstone similar to those found in the facade. Entrance to the building is provided from the nave and through separate outside doors. A cornerstone on the southeast corner bears the date 1890. A real attempt was made to use a facing stone like that found in the facade so that no real contrast exists.

He was born in 1943 and educated at Trinity College, Oxford. He taught social anthropology at Queen's University Belfast. He is an Honorary Associate of the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, and an Associate of the School for Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto. He currently holds a Canada Research Chair at the University of the Fraser Valley in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Anthropologist In the 1960s, as a graduate student at Oxford, Hugh Brody worked as an anthropologist in Ireland. This led to his book Inishkillane, Change And Decline in the West of Ireland. The field-work for this study took him to Connemara and West Cork, where he lived and worked with peasant farmers, fishermen and as a barman in a village bar. Contracted by Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann he spent time on Gola Island, off the coast of County Donegal, research that led to his contribution to the book Gola, The Life and Last Days of an Island Community, co-authored with F. H. A. Aalen.Inishkillane, first published by Allen Lane and the Penguin Press, 1973. Subsequent editions: Shocken, New York, 1974; Douglas & McIntyre, Vancouver; Faber & Faber, London, Gola, published b y IRL:Mercier, Cork, 1969. In 1969, he did his first Canadian work, supported by the Northern Science Research Group at what was then the Canadian Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. This took him to the skid row area of Edmonton, Alberta in the Canadian Prairies. His report on that work, Indians on Skid Row, published in 1970, led to changes in government policy, especially in relation to Native Friendship Centres ‚Äì crucial in giving support to Native people adrift in Canadian cities.Indians on Skid Row was published by DIAND, Ottawa, 1971, as a report in its Northern Science Research Group series In the 1970s, as a research officer with the Northern Science Research Group, he did extensive field work in the Arctic, living with Inuit in the communities of Pond Inlet on Baffin Island and Sanikiluaq on the Belcher Islands.The peoples' champion, The Guardian, profile, 27 January 2001. He learned two dialects of Inuktitut, North Baffin and South Hudson Bay, and wrote The People's Land, Inuit and Whites in the Eastern Arctic. This is a book that looks at how colonial relations, through the history of the fur trade, church missions and the Canadian government, have shaped the social and psychological circumstances of the far north. The argument and descriptions focus very much on a particular time in a particular place, but resonate with parallel experiences among indigenous peoples around the world. In the course of his work with the Northern Science Research Group, Brody also developed an innovative program that aimed to give new levels of support for families who wanted to live on the land. Brody was also one of those who in the mid-1970s first urged within the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs the idea of the separation of the Canadian north into two indigenous jurisdictions, with that of the east becoming an Inuit political territory. This came into being with the creation of Nunavut in 1999. In 1975, Brody resigned from his position in the Canadian Civil Service. He was then based at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, where he became an Honorary Associate. In 1976‚Äì78 he worked on the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project, in the Northwest Territories, where he was co-ordinator for the land use mapping carried out in the North Baffin region. He also assembled an Arctic-wide account of Inuit perceptions of land occupancy, building a collage of Inuit voices from all the communities of the Northwest Territories.See the three volume, Report of the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project, ed Milton Freeman, Ottawa: DIAND, 1976 He later worked on a similar project with Inuit and settlers of Labrador, which was published in Our Footsteps Are Everywhere (1978).See: Continuity and change: The Inuit settlers of Labrador. In C. Bryce-Bennett (Ed.), Our Footsteps Are Everywhere. Ottawa, ON: DIAND, 1978 In 1977, Brody was a witness to the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry, giving evidence on the nature of northern development, alcohol abuse and Inuit languages. He then became a member of Justice Thomas R. Berger's staff, helping to prepare the two volume report that set out the remarkable conclusions of the inquiry.See Northern Homeland, Northern Frontier, The Report of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry, first published as a Canadian government report in 1978, and then as a book by Douglas & MacIntyre, Vancouver, 1987. In the 1980s, working for the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, Brody lived and worked with the Dunne-za and Cree of northeast British Columbia ‚Äì the project and experiences that led to his book Maps And Dreams. This account of anthropological research and cultural mapping with a hunting community, and especially the laying of frontier development onto the ways Dunne-za and Cree see and understand their territories, became a classic of indigenous studies. Its use of alternating chapters, switching between first person narrative and social scientific writing has also given it a significant place in the history of the literature of anthropology.See Google Books reviews. Maps And Dreams was first published by Dougas & MacIntyre, Vancouver, and Norman and Hobhouse, UK, 1981. It has been in print since, in several editions and translations. Douglas & MacIntyre published an edition with a new introduction (1988). Faber & Faber, London, have published it in paperback. Brody worked with Justice Berger again in 1991-2 as a member of the World Bank's Morse Commission, which had the job of assessing implications of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, a vast hydro and irrigation project in western India.See Sardar Sarovar, the Report of the Independent Review, first published by Resource Futures International, Ottawa, 1992. Also Berger's account of the Review: American University International Law Review, Volume 9, Issue 1, 1993, His role in public inquiries and assessment of the impact of large scale developments on indigenous communities continued when he became Chairman of the Snake River Independent Review. This was a mediation between the Idaho Power Company and the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho in relation to the building of the Bliss Dam on the Snake River in the 1950s.See Michael Mirande, Sustainable Natural Resource Development, Legal Dispute,and Indigenous Peoples: Problem-Solving across Cultures, 11 TUL. ENVTL. L.J. 33, 44 (1997). As one of the lawyers engaged by the Idaho Power Company, Mirande has analysed the originality, nature and some of the challenges of the Snake River Independent Review. Since 1997, Brody has worked on projects in southern Africa. This began when he helped co-ordinate background research for the ‚Ä°Khomani San Land Claim in South Africa's southern Kalahari. This work led to filming many aspects of the claim, including its aftermath. In 2008, accompanied by the Canadian cinematographer Kirk Tougas, he filmed the beneficiaries of the claim as they reflected upon how it had changed their lives in the nine years since the claim was accepted. Working with the UK NGO Open Channels, and funded by the UK charity Comic Relief, Brody also led projects with and for San in Namibia and Botswana. The film work in South Africa led to the DVD Tracks Across Sand ‚Äì four and a half hours of film edited by long-term collaborationorator Haida Paul shot in the course of land claims research, oral history and language research in the northern Cape of South Africa. This was to be released in 2012/13.Information on this: University of the Fraser Valley, and Face To Face Media, 30 Nov / 3 December 2012. See Hugh Brody DVD on ‚Ä°Khomani San to premiere in Chilliwack Nov 30 and Hugh Brody DVD on Kalahari bushmen to premiere in Chilliwack Writer As a writer, Brody has published many essays and a collection of short stories, as well as his non-fiction books. His stories, Means of Escape, was hailed by Doris Lessing, who wrote: \\"I recommend these tales to all connoisseurs of the short story, for they are unique in flavour and style, altogether unusual, and will stay in my memory like elegiac and lyrical songs or poems. Beautiful.\\" The Canadian writer M. T. Kelly described the collection as \\"Intense, deeply felt, charged fiction...A masterful accomplishment\\".Published by Faber & Faber, London, and Douglas & MacIntyre, Vancouver, 1985. Quotes from jacket of paperback editions. Brody has also written a number of screenplays, one of which, co-authored with Michael Ignatieff, became the film 1919.The Screenplay for Nineteen Nineteen was published by Faber and Faber, London, in 1985. John Berger wrote an afterword, included in the Faber and Faber edition. Canadian philosopher George Woodcock described Maps and Dreams (1981) as \\"an impressive attempt to dispel popular errors about peoples whom anthropologists used condescendingly to call ‚Äòprimitive hunters‚Äô. Brody is also seeking to prove that hunting economies can continue to be viable even in modern North America, and that the way of life associated with them is worth preserving.\\" In 2000, Brody published The Other Side of Eden: Hunter-Gatherers, Farmers and the Shaping of the World. This is a book that puts together experience of and thinking about many of the fields of travel and anthropology that have been at the centre of Brody's work. It looks at the relationship between culture and language, the way the agricultural way of life is at the core of the mythic ideas of human universality to be found in Genesis, and the way hunting cultures have been wrongly identified as nomadic ‚Äì pointing out that it is agriculture, with its inherent tendency to produce surplus population and propensity for colonial expansion and warfare, that is the most mobile of ways of life. The Other Side of Eden takes a very wide view of history and cultures, yet is rooted in closely observed anthropology, much of it from Brody's own field experience.The Other Side of Eden: Hunter-gatheres, Farmers and the Shaping of the World was first published by Douglas and MacIntyre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Faber and Faber, London, in 2000. Subsequent editions and translations have paperback UK and Canada; hardback, Farrar Straus Giroux, New York, 2001), as well Chinese, Japanese and Dutch editions Brody also wrote an article called 'Arensberg and Kimball revisited' This article was about Inishkillane in County Clare, Ireland. Filmmaker In 1975, Brody's filmmaking began with his work for ITV's series Disappearing World, going with director Michael Grigsby to the Inuit community of Pond Inlet, where they made the film The People's Land, Eskimos of Pond Inlet. This led to Brody directing documentaries, first in Canada (working with First Nations in many parts of the country), as well as in the UK and Australia. These include the award-winning Hunters And Bombers, a film that follows the Innu resistance to low level flying in Labrador from CFB Goose Bay.For the National Film Board of Canada's information about Hunters And Bombers see: Hunters and Bombers. He also made On Indian Land, a film with the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en of northern British Columbia, and Time Immemorial, the opening film in the series As Long As The Rivers Flow.For information about As Long As The Rivers Flow, and Time Immemorial, the opening film in the series, see: As Long as the Rivers Flow and the NFB information: Time Immemorial All his work with Canadian First Nations depends on a non-narration, intimate style: the people in the films are the films, which go deep into the experience and points of view of indigenous peoples ‚Äì and often into their grief, and ways of dealing with loss. His film The Washing of Tears made with the Mowachaht- Muchalaht people of Gold River, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, is an exploration of how one community looked to their fractured heritage to deal with extremes of dispossession and grief.For NFB information about The Washing of Tears, see: The Washing of Tears Hugh Brody and Michael Ignatieff's screenplay 1919 was filmed in 1983 and released in 1984. It explores history, memory and the place of psycho-analysis in an understanding of both the self and the 20th century. John Berger, in his introduction to the Faber and Faber edition of the screenplay, wrote: \\"Nineteen Nineteen speaks directly to what we know about life, composed inextricably of the most intimate movements of the heart, accident, and the remorseless movement of history.\\" Philip French, reviewing the film for London's The Observer noted: \\"With Nineteen Nineteen, cinema's relationship to psychoanalysis has come of age. This is the first great film about the subject.\\" The film had a remarkable cast, starring Paul Scofield, Maria Schell, Diana Quick, Clare Higgins and the young Colin Firth.For information about Nineteen Nineteen see the British Film Institute site: Nineteen Nineteen Brody's films for British television include England's Henry Moore, a project that was conceived by writer and political commentator Anthony Barnett. It explores Barnett's exposition of the links between Moore's work and the place of Britain in the world. In 2002‚Äì03 Brody made Inside Australia, a journey with Antony Gormley into the Australian western desert to follow the installation of one of Gormley's most remarkable and visually stunning pieces of work.For information about England's Henry Moore see: England's Henry Moore: The sculptures of \\"the greatest Englishman\\" and for Inside Australia: Inside Australia In 2005‚Äì08, Brody made a film in a prison in British Columbia, The Meaning of Life, in which he explores the use of aboriginal culture as a means of rehabilitation. At the centre of this film are accounts that inmates give of their lives and attempts at rehabilitation. In 2012, he finished work on a 4-hour DVD, Tracks Across Sand, which shows in 17 segments the results of filming with the ‚Ä°Khomani San as they develop and then cope with their 1999 land claim.For details about both Meaning of Life and Tracks Across Sand see: Biographies of Key Personnel In 2014, a large collection of materials gathered from the projects with the ‚Ä°Khomani San was deposited with the University of Cape Town Libraries and can be viewed on the digital collections website.

HSL oversees the operation of all of Helsinki's public transportation. The system consists of local buses, trams, metro trains, ferries, commuter trains, and bikeshare. Apart from four electric buses, HSL does not own rolling stock. Due to this, HSL relies on third-party contractors for the day-to-day operation of the transit system.  History = Founding  HSL was founded on 1 January 2010 on the basis of the Finnish public transportation law, joukkoliikennelaki, which was adopted on 3 December 2009.http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2009/20090869 According to joukkoliikennelaki, HSL is responsible for the planning of public transportation in Greater Helsinki. The traffic functions of the inter- municipal Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council (YTV) and planning, procuring and tendering functions of Helsinki City Transport (HKL, within the city of Helsinki) were moved into the transport authority. When it was founded, HSL had a revenue of over ‚Ç¨500 million and approximately 350 employees.  Digitransit  In 2016, HSL started to develop a revamped version of its native journey planner, Reittiopas, originally released by YTV in 2001. The replacement intermodal public transport route planner named as DigitransitDigitransit is built on open source OpenTripPlanner. In February 2017, the new route planner was opened for public use, and the phasing-out of Reittiopas Classic began. Name V√§lkky, a blue cube with a face and a cap, is the official mascot of the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority. The official name of the transport authority is Helsingin seudun liikenne -kuntayhtym√§ HSL in Finnish and Samkommunen Helsingforsregionens trafik HRT in Swedish. The official name of HSL in English is Helsinki Regional Transport Authority. Also the shorter form of the name, Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) may be used in everyday use.  Transportation  HSL oversees the operation of all public transportation in the Helsinki region. However, apart from select bus routes with electric units, the agency does not operate any rolling stock. Therefore, it relies mainly on independent contractors for the operation of the network.  Metro  The Helsinki Metro is operated by HKL. The metro line opened in 1982. The system serves 25 stations in total on its two lines, M1 and M2. = L√§nsimetro = The first phase of the L√§nsimetro expansion program extended the metro lines west to Lauttasaari and southern Espoo, serving eight new stations. The second phase of the extension is slated to open in 2023. At that time, the total number of metro stations on the line will increase from 25 to 30.  Commuter rail  Commuter rail service in the region is operated by VR. There are 52 stations in the network, which are served by 15 lines. Out of HSL's three rail networks, commuter rail is the most far-reaching; it serves the northern, north-eastern, and western suburbs of the city, as well as Helsinki Airport in Vantaa.  Trams  Trams in Helsinki are operated by HKL. Helsinki was the only Finnish city with tram service in use as of November, 2017. Tram service in Helsinki began in 1891.  Buses  HSL offers three types of bus service: standard buses, neighbourhood buses and two small headway crosstown lines (\\"runkolinja\\", literally: trunk lines). HSL tickets are also valid on most U-routes which are run by separate companies and serve cities outside of the HSL area. = Standard bus routes = The standard bus routes can be divided into the following categories: * Helsinki internal bus routes ** 14-23: buses serving the central area ** 37-43: buses leaving from Kamppi or Elielinaukio and serving the areas of Haaga and Kannelm√§ki ** 50-69: buses leaving or going through the city centre area or Pasila and serving Lauttasaari and the areas north of the city centre within Helsinki city limits ** 70-79: buses serving the Malmi area ** 80-98: eastern metro connection buses *** 80-89: buses serving areas near Herttoniemi *** 90-98: buses serving areas near It√§keskus, Myllypuro, Kontula, Mellunm√§ki, Rastila and Vuosaari * Espoo internal bus routes * Vantaa internal bus routes * Regional routes within the HSL area ** 111-739: these buses have a basic numbering system with the smaller numbers mostly going west towards Espoo, the larger numbers mostly going north-east towards Vantaa and the some 500-series buses being cross-city routes The numbers listed above have exceptions (e.g. Helsinki internal school bus route 91 which serves the √ñstersundom area). = Neighbourhood bus routes = The neighbourhood lines use mini-buses which stop anywhere on the line at a passenger's request. These lines often run hourly from morning to afternoon on weekdays and have little to no service on weekends. The lines are mostly meant to be used by people with difficulties moving but they can be used by all people. = Routes 550 and 560 = There are two orange colour-coded cross- city lines which are called trunk lines are routes 550 and 560. 550 runs from the It√§keskus metro station in the east, through the Oulunkyl√§, Huopalahti, Pit√§j√§nm√§ki and Lepp√§vaara commuter train stations and the western metro stations of Aalto-Yliopisto and Tapiola, terminating at Westendin asema in the west. 560 runs from Rastila metro station in the east, through the Vuosaari, Mellunm√§ki and Kontula metro stations and the Malmi and Myyrm√§ki commuter train stations terminating in Honkasuo in the north. Both routes use long wheel-base buses which have a high capacity and are colour-coded orange instead of the regular blue colour-coding on buses. Buses on the route 550 run every 4‚Äì10 minutes between 4:20 and 21:30 and every 15‚Äì30 minutes between 21:30 and 1:00 on weekdays with buses running every 10 minutes between 10:00 and 19:00 and every 15‚Äì30 minutes between 4:50 and 10:00 and between 19:00 and 1:00 on Saturdays, and every 10 minutes between 10:00 and 19:00 and every 15‚Äì30 minutes between 5:20 and 10:00 and between 19:00 and 1:00 on Sundays. Buses on the route 560 run every 7‚Äì10 minutes between 5:15 and 20:30 and every 15‚Äì30 minutes between 4:30 and 5:15 and between 20:30 and 0:30 with buses running every 10 minutes between 11:00 and 18:30 and every 15‚Äì30 minutes between 5:00 and 11:00 and between 18:30 and 0:30 on Saturdays, and every 15 minutes between 11:00 and 20:30 and every 20‚Äì30 minutes between 5:30 and 11:00 and between 20:30 and 24:00 on Sundays. A plan to build a light-rail connection from It√§keskus to Keilaniemi following the current route of bus route 550 has been finalised and accepted by the cities of Helsinki and Espoo. Construction is set to start in 2019. The light-rail will have a track gauge of 1000mm which is the same as on the Helsinki tram system. The vehicles would be larger versions of the current Helsinki trams and would be built by Finnish company Transtech. = Bus operators = Bus services are divided among multiple operators. The companies granted with traffic contracts as of 2/2017 are: * Nobina * Pohjolan Liikenne * Helsingin Bussiliikenne * Transdev * Savonlinja * Tammelundin Liikenne * √Öbergin Linja * Korsisaari * Taksikuljetus * Reissu-Ruoti * Tilausliikenne Nikkanen * V-S Bussipalvelut  Ferry  A ferry to Suomenlinna is part of the HSL network. This route is operated on two ferries, Suokki and Suomenlinna II.  Bikeshare  In 2016 HSL launched Helsinki's bikeshare program. Starting on 2 May 2016, users could register to use the network for a day fee of ‚Ç¨5, a week fee of ‚Ç¨10 or the entire season from May to the end of October for ‚Ç¨25. The initial network included 500 bikes, one of which a user could use to travel from any of the 50 stations to another. The bikeshare system is a joint venture between CityBike Finland, HKL, and HSL. The system is sponsored by HOK-Elanto's grocery shop chain Alepa, which has purchased the commercial space on the bicycles. Due to this, the bicycles are colloquially known as alepapy√∂r√§t (‚ÄùAlepa bikes‚Äù). In late 2016 HSL announced the details of a revamped bikeshare system, this time spanning 1,500 bikes and 150 stations. The expanded bike program brought the service to Munkkiniemi, Pasila, and Vallila. In addition to having 1,400 bikes and 140 stations in Helsinki, the service covered Matinkyl√§ and Olari in Espoo with 100 bikes and 10 stations. The 2018 season saw a further-expanded network, with a total of 2,200 bikes at 220 stations, of which 70 are located in Espoo. The season fare was increased to ‚Ç¨30.  Ticketing  As of 27 April 2019, the HSL area is divided into four zones designated A, B, C and D, roughly circularly divided according to distance from the city centre of Helsinki. Customers are obligated to buy a ticket spanning at least two zones at a time; the exception to this is zone D, for which a single zone ticket is available. Available tickets include single, day and seasonal tickets, all of which can be bought using a travel card or from HSL's vending machines or mobile application. Additionally, single and day tickets may be bought aboard buses from the driver. HSL controls the sale and inspection of transit tickets. Apart from the bus network, all of HSL's services use a proof-of- payment system: there are no gates at metro and commuter rail stations or tram stops. Instead, passengers are required to present a valid ticket to fare inspectors, who randomly patrol the network. If caught without a valid ticket, a passenger must pay a fine of ‚Ç¨80 in addition to the full price of the ticket.  Zones  * ‚Äì spans from the city centre of Helsinki to the districts of Lauttasaari, Etel√§-Haaga, K√§pyl√§ and Kulosaari * ‚Äì the rest of Helsinki, Kauniainen, eastern Espoo and southern Vantaa * ‚Äì the √ñstersundom district of Helsinki, western Espoo and northern Vantaa * ‚Äì the town of Kerava and the municipalities of Kirkkonummi, Siuntio, Sipoo and Tuusula ** Travelers traveling between the HSL zone and J√§rvenp√§√§ may also use zone D tickets; the city will become a full member of HSL in 2022. Organization HSL is owned by the cities of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Kerava, and Kauniainen and the municipalities of Kirkkonummi and Sipoo. In 2017, Tuusula and Siuntio voted to join HSL. The other municipalities in the Greater Helsinki area (J√§rvenp√§√§, Nurmij√§rvi, M√§nts√§l√§, Pornainen, Hyvink√§√§, and Vihti) have the possibility of joining HSL in the future. About 1.3 million people live in the 14 municipalities of Greater Helsinki and the population is estimated to increase to approximately 1.5 million by the year 2030. HSL's office is located in Opastinsilta 6 A, Helsinki. Visual identity HSL's logo for tram transportation After the founding of HSL, the visual identity of all transportation services in Helsinki was unified under one brand name and logo. The HSL identity is heavily based on the color-coding of different elements to highlight the types of information presented; danger is represented in red, optional information in blue. The base color for HSL is blue (#007AC9). Each of the forms of transit are represented with a color of its own: * HSL Bus blue * HSL Tram green * HSL Commuter rail purple * HSL Metro orange * HSL Ferry light blue HSL's visual identity was created by the design office Kokoro & Moi. The designers have explained the concept as: :\\"The outlook shows reliability, freshness and ease of approaching. The octagonal shape of the logo is symbolizing the expanding public transportation network. The loops in the logo remind of leaf shoots, telling of new ways of action and new partnerships and of ecological values. The eight loops also represent all cardinal directions and are sending a message of the broad-ranged function of the organization. In the middle of the logo there are two graphical lines, symbolizing uniting organizations and the public transportation with its tracks, wheels and map lines.\\" Work HSL's duty is to do its part in taking care of the functioning, economical aspects and caring of nature in greater Helsinki. This goal is achieved by promoting the usage of public transportation and by organizing affordable and well functioning public transportation services. HSL takes care of planning the regional public transportation and internal public transportation of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa. Beside planning, HSL also tenders the bus companies. The organization owns no buses or rail rolling stock. One of the agency's jobs is to compile the Helsinki Region Transport System Plan.

After the Episcopal congregation dwindled, the building subsequently housed the Primera Iglesia Evangelica Metodista Libra de los Oranges, a Methodist congregation. The building's interior was destroyed, and exterior badly damaged, by fire on January 1, 2016.http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2016/01/fire_rips_through_historic_west_orange_church_repo.html The church was called an \\"outstanding example of Gothic Revival architecture\\" by Preservation New Jersey, and was listed as one of the ten most endangered historic sites in New Jersey in 1996. It has been said that the building \\"represents the beginning and the end of the ecclesiological style in the United States.\\" The Ecclesiological style movement in church architecture advocated Gothic revival architecture using theological arguments. History The original Episcopal congregation was founded in 1828 as an offshoot of Trinity Parish in Newark. Within a few decades it had become the largest and wealthiest Episcopal congregation in and around \\"The Oranges\\" of New Jersey. Work on the brownstone main church began in 1828. An addition completed in 1860‚Äì1861, including the steeple, is attributed to architect Richard Upjohn. St. Mark's ran the first elementary school in West Orange beginning in 1865. This school building was destroyed by fire in 1926. It also ran the first high school in West Orange, which graduated a class of nine students in 1893. A new high school building was opened in 1898, which was destroyed by fire on February 27, 1913. The parish prospered until the 1960s, when declining attendance led to mounting financial hardships. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, but the church and its adjacent cemetery fell into disrepair. In 2004, the Episcopal Diocese of Newark leased it to Lamb of God Fellowship, a Renewal congregation, for what was intended to be a long-term stay, but the Fellowship left in 2009 due to the high cost of maintaining the property. The cross atop the structure was shaken loose in the 2011 earthquake and fell to the ground. The Diocese sold the property to another religious organization in early 2015.http://www.dioceseofnewark.org/content/regarding-former-st-marks-church- west-orange The church caught fire on January 1, 2016 around 5 a.m. (1000 UTC) and was ablaze for three hours. No injuries were reported in the historic church. Update: January 1, 2017. The church currently in the construction phase of being fully restored by architects Zachary Gidich and David Sepulveda.

They organized Trinity Church and built a small stone church building with a steeple in 1743. A charter was granted by King George II in 1746. The building was used as a hospital for both British and American troops during the American Revolutionary War. It sustained damage during the conflict and the present building was planned and built. It was completed in 1810. A chancel and sanctuary were added to the east end in 1857. Trinity Church was elevated to cathedral status in 1944. St. Philip's Church, a predominantly African American parish on High and West Market Streets, was destroyed in a fire in 1964. Two years later the two congregations were merged. The Very Rev. Dillard Robinson was elected dean in 1968. He was the first African American to serve as a cathedral dean in the United States.

Overall, it ranked 83rd in the country as of January 2018 with a nameplate capacity of per day. The facility is owned by Marathon Petroleum. History Crude oil was first produced in commercial quantities in North Dakota on April 4, 1951. Construction on the refinery began in 1953, and it was completed in 1954. The Standard Oil Company, builder of the 29,000 barrels per day refinery held a grand opening on October 2, 1954. A location along the Missouri River was selected because of the large volumes of water needed by the process units and for power generation. However beginning in the early 1980s, refinery unit expansions have relied almost exclusively on air-cooled equipment. Early Operations It began operations on October 2, 1954 with four process units (pipestill, fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU), vapor recovery unit (VRU) and solid-catalyst oligomer or \\"polymer gasoline\\" unit) plus a two boiler co- generation steam/electrical powerhouse and associated tankage for crude storage and product blending and shipping. An alkylation unit began operation the following year; the catalytic reforming unit was added in 1958. Over 2.6 million barrels of oil storage capacity exists at the site. Ownership and name changes A number of ownership and name changes are associated with the facility. American Oil Company was the name used in the upper Midwest by the Standard Oil Company of Indiana but in 1973 shortened it to Amoco Oil Company for marketing purposes. Keeping with the trend in the 1980s for the Standard Oil spinoffs to establish separate identities, Standard Oil Company of Indiana changed its name to Amoco Corporation in 1985. Amoco merged with British Petroleum in December 1998 to become BP-Amoco. BP-Amoco sold the Mandan Refinery to Tesoro Corporation on September 6, 2001. Tesoro Corporation underwent a name change on August 1, 2017 to Andeavor after its acquisition of Western Refining. On April 30, 2018 Marathon Petroleum announced it would seek to buy Andeavor and close the deal by the end of 2018. Recent History The refinery hosted President Donald Trump on September 6, 2017 for a speech on tax reform. The visit marks the third time a sitting US president visited the city of Mandan. Operations Gasoline accounts for almost 55% of the product volume, but both on-road and off-road diesel fuel account and other distillates such as jet-fuel and furnace oil account for another 35% of the product volume. The remaining volume is largely fuel gas (used on-site), liquidified petroleum gas (LPG) i.e. propane and residual fuel oil. Approximately 40% of the product volume is consumed in the state, with the majority of the remaining volume sold in Minnesota. Facility renovations The original crude furnace was replaced in 1974 with a CO-fired furnace to capture heat from the FCU exhaust as well as burn the carbon monoxide generated as a process byproduct. A sulfur recovery unit was placed on-line in 1986 to lower sulfur dioxide emissions by over 65%. To support an unprecedented demand for distillates in North Dakota's oil patch, a major expansion project was undertaken in 2012 to increase the processing capacity to 68,000 BPD. A wet scrubber was installed on the CO-fired crude furnace to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions further and eliminate stack particulates in 2015. The expansion in 2017 brings the current nameplate processing capacity at the site to almost 74,000 barrels per day. Environmental and safety record The prestigious National Blue Heron Environmental Achievement Award, sponsored by the National Wildlife Federation and supported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in its North American Waterfowl Management Plan, recognizes outstanding contributions toward the conservation of waterfowl habitat. The Mandan Refinery received the award in 1985 for its \\"North 40\\" project. The North 40 project began in 1974 as a creative way to expand the refinery's wastewater treating system. Championed by then refinery manager William \\"Bill\\" Burns, over half of the refinery's 960-acre was devoted to wastewater treatment and wildlife conservation. Nearly 200 bird species and many types of mammals find food, cover and breeding sites in this wildlife habitat. The facility has achieved multiple safety milestones. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recognized the then Tesoro Petroleum refinery in Mandan \\"for an exemplary workplace safety and health program.\\" The petroleum refinery was designated as a \\"star\\" site, the highest level of recognition offered by OSHA's Voluntary Protection Programs. In 2014, its workforce achieved one of the best OSHA Recordable Rate safety performances in the country. In 2015, the refinery logged 3.8 million hours without Days Away From Work (DAFW) injury. In its most recent safety achievement, the Mandan Refinery was awarded the AFPM Silver Safety award in May 2018 as it was among the top 5% of all refining member companies in safety performance. Pipeline system The supply of petroleum crude oil enters the plant through an Andeavor Logistics owned and operated 16-inch transmission pipeline pipeline system which connects to a 750-mile network across western North Dakota including the former Bakken Link pipeline. The crude delivery system also maintains multiple interconnects to other pipelines and terminals throughout the Williston Basin as well as interconnects to Canada pipelines. About the time of North Dakota's surge in oil production when it rose from the 9th ranked producer in 2002 to 2nd highest in 2014, that connection was repurposed. The crude oil processed at the facility is now sweet crude oil from North Dakota. A 10-inch refined products pipeline, now owned and operated by NuStar Energy L.P which departs to the east supplies product terminals in Jamestown-ND, Moorhead-MN, Sauk Center-MN and Rosemount-MN with connections to other pipeline systems at Jamestown and Rosemount. A dedicated pipe for railroad diesel fuel also exists from the refinery to the BNSF Railway railyard south of downtown Mandan. Fuel is also distributed by semi-trailer trucks and railroad cars from its corresponding loading racks located on the refinery proper.

The genus is known from a single, diameter, full flower. The holotype is currently deposited in the collections of the Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon, as number \\"Sd‚Äì9‚Äì158\\", where it was studied and described by Dr George Poinar. Dr Poinar published his 2002 type description for Palaeoraphe in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society volume number 139. The genus name is a combination of the Greek word palaios meaning \\"ancient\\" and Raphia a genus of palm, while the species name dominicana references the Dominican Republic where the fossil was discovered. The type specimen was excavated from the La Toca mine northeast of Santiago de los Caballeros. Palaeoraphe has been placed in the Corypheae subtribe Livistoninae, which has twelve modern genera found in both the old world and the new world. Of the three modern genera the Palaeoraphe flower is similar in character Brahea, Acoelorrhaphe and Colpothrinax, with the structure being closest in structure to that of Brahea. Both genera having distinct sepals, petals with furrows facing the axis of the flower, and similarly shaped and sized anthers. However the two genera can be told apart by the stigmas, which are united for their entire length in Brahea, and by the more relaxed positioning of the anthers in Palaeoraphe. The flower of P. dominicana is a calyx of three broad sepals with irregular to fringed apices. The three petals are joined at their bases and of the six stamins, those paired with petals are relxed into depressions on the petal surface, while the remaining three stamins are partially erect. It is proposed by Dr. Poinar that Palaeoraphe may have been a stenotopic genus which was restricted to the Greater Antilles and possibly to just the island of Hispaniola. The extinction of Palaeoraphe may have been caused by floral and faunal shifts during the Pliocene and Pleistocene.

The congregation was founded as a Swedish Lutheran parish in 1703 after local residents tired of crossing the river to Delaware or Philadelphia to worship. The first minister, Lars Tollstadius, arrived in the area in 1701. The church was the first Swedish congregation in New Jersey and originally it worshiped in a log building. Services were held in Swedish until 1784. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 for its significance in architecture and religion. With History In 1641, Peter Hollander Ridder, the second governor of New Sweden purchased from local Indians the entire eastern side of the Delaware River extending from Raccoon Creek to Cape May. The first settlement by the Swedes was on the banks of the Raccoon Creek, originally named Raccoon and later Swedesboro. To attend church, the Swedish settlers in Raccoon had to cross the river to Wilmington or Philadelphia. The difficulty of this crossing led to the decision to build a new church on the banks of Raccoon Creek. The site selected was near the new bridge for Kings Highway, which led from Burlington to Salem. In 1703, they purchased along the Raccoon Creek and on part of it established their own church, the first Swedish language church in New Jersey.Records Of The Swedish Lutheran Churches At Raccoon & Penns Neck; 1713-1786. [New Jersey] (translated & comp. by the Fed. Writers Project; WPA. Intro. & notes by Dr Amandus Johnson. 1938) http://www.sistlergenealogy.com/title-detail.php?id=64399 Trinity Church was originally a Swedish Lutheran Parish. From 1703 to 1786, it was served by clergy sent from Sweden. With the completion of a new church building in 1786, the Swedish Mission was drawing to a close. The Swedish language was almost extinct and the people no longer felt the same bond of sympathy with the land of their forebears. The congregations in New Jersey did not desire new pastors from Sweden and could not afford to offer them decent support. In October 1789 a semblance of affiliation by Trinity Church with the Episcopal Church in America began. The church is now known as Trinity Episcopal \\"Old Swedes\\" Church and is a member parish of the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey.

The program originated as the lead vehicle of the U.S. Army's Ground Combat Vehicle program coordinated by TACOM and spawned a parallel program coordinated by DARPA. The purpose of the program was to replace existing armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles in U.S. Army service. The DARPA project aimed to have the vehicle designed by 2015. Derivatives of the vehicle based on a common chassis‚Äîsuch as tanks and ambulances‚Äîwere expected to be manufactured. It replaced the previous attempt at a next-generation infantry transport, the XM1206 Infantry Carrier Vehicle. The Ground Combat Vehicle program was cancelled in February 2014.US Army, Marines Struggle With Infantry Vehicle Replacements - Defensenews.com, 6 April 2014  Design  The Army emphasized affordability, rapid deployment, and low risk technology for the GCV. The Army required that all aspects of the Ground Combat Vehicle be at technology readiness level 6. The shortfalls of rapid deployment would be mitigated through an incremental addition of components as technology matures. The Army provided details from the Manned Ground Vehicle effort to utilize on the GCV. The GCV was required to have better protection than any vehicle in the military's inventory. General Peter W. Chiarelli said that the \\"four main fundamentals\\" of the vehicle were: The ability to carry 12 soldiers and operate in all forms of combat; have significant protection; and deliver the first production vehicle by 2018. The IFV would be modular and networked and offer improved survivability, mobility, and power management functions. The GCV family would use technologies pioneered with the IFV lead vehicle effort. The Mounted Soldier System would have been standard wear for GCV crew members. The Mounted Soldier System (MSS) was being developed for GCV crew members. MSS worked as a force multiplier enhancing situation awareness, comfort, and safety. Dismounted leaders will utilize the Ground Soldier Systems.  Network  The IFV would be operable with the current Battle Command Control and Communications Suite but would gradually use a more revolutionary networked integration system. The system would support integration with unmanned systems, and dismounted soldiers, providing adaptive access points and connectivity. The new network concept called for decentralization of decision making. The Mounted Soldier System was to enhance situational awareness through wireless communications and input from vehicle sensors and external sources such as other vehicles.  Electrical power  The IFV would provide exportable electrical power, and battery charging capability for soldier systems.  Countermeasures  Thermal management and acoustic noise reduction would be utilized to avoid detection. The vehicle would be able to avoid threats by laying obscurants. An array of hit avoidance systems would be leveraged and the Army offered the various active protection systems developed for the manned ground vehicle program. The GCV enabled the detection and neutralization of mines at standoff ranges. The vehicle was also to be equipped with an engagement detection system. The Army required the IFV to have the passive blast protection level equal to the MRAP. The Army made available the composition of the armor of the manned ground vehicle program. A transparent armor shield would provide protection for the vehicle commander when exposed through the turret. Personnel would leverage harnesses and restraints to mitigate trauma. In addition, a Vehicle Health Management System would provide vehicle diagnostic monitoring systems for commanders. A fire suppression system and ammunition detonation protection would be utilized for damage control. The Mounted Soldier System would protect crew members from ballistic, thermal, and CBRN threats. The Mounted Soldier System incorporated fire retardant systems such as the Improved Combat Vehicle Crewman Coverall and undergarments, facewear, gloves, and footwear. Ballistic protection would come from the Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmet, eyewear, a maxillofacial shield, and improvements to body armor. A secondary squad egress was to be provided for the squad to exit in emergencies.  Tactics  The Infantry Fighting Vehicle variant was intended to fill the infantry transport role in Heavy Brigade Combat Teams replacing the aging M113 APC, M2 Bradley, and M1126 Infantry Carrier Vehicle. It was the U.S. Army's intention that the IFV replace the M113 APC in the near term, and the M2 Bradley and M1126 ICV in the midterm. In the U.S. Army, as part of the ongoing restructuring, Heavy Brigade Combat Team Brigades would have an arsenal of 62 IFV's, battalions would have 29, and platoons would have 4. Platoons were to be led by platoon leader GCV which would be accompanied by platoon medic, forward observer, Radio Transmission Operator, and other attachments and would command three other GCVs. The Army placed importance on the GCV's ability to carry a full nine-man squad. Numerous Army studies have concluded that a squad, containing two fireteams, should be composed of nine to eleven soldiers. These numbers allow the squad to accomplish the fire and maneuver doctrine, and for squad resilience, lethality, and leader span of control. The M2 Bradley cannot carry a complete squad from one vehicle, creating risk when transitioning from mounted to dismounted operations. The Bradley's lower carrying capacity was accepted for greater (than previous vehicles) mounted lethality and cost savings, leading to squads being broken apart for transport. A GCV with a nine-man squad would have allowed the squad leader to control and communicate with the squad while mounted, simplify the transition to dismounted operations in complex terrain, and allow the squad to conduct independent fire and maneuver immediately upon dismount. Replacing the Bradley on a one-for-one basis would have four GCVs per mechanized infantry platoon carrying one full nine-man squad in a single vehicle, with three vehicles carrying squads and one carrying the platoon's organic and attached enablers.Understanding Why a Ground Combat Vehicle That Carries Nine Dismounts Is Important to the Army - Rand.org, 11 June 2013  Development  The Ground Combat Vehicle was envisioned to be a model of acquisition reform.  Initial program  IFV schedule as of January 2010 Puma is one of the best protected infantry fighting vehicles In the initial plan, the first variant of the vehicle was to be prototyped in 2015 and fielded by 2017. The U.S. military planned on procuring 1,450 IFVs at a total program cost of $40 billion. The program was abruptly canceled in August 2010, before any contracts were awarded. ;Conception Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army General Peter Chiarelli hosts the second Industry Day meeting An Army presentation in March revealed that TARDEC, ARL, and TRADOC - ARCIC had partnered to analyze the survivability of the army's \\"Ground Combat Vehicle\\". Army Chief of Staff Robert Gates announced his intention of halting funding for the XM1206 Infantry Carrier Vehicle of the FCS manned ground vehicle program in April 2009. In late May, Army and Department of Defense representatives outlined plans for the cancellation of Future Combat Systems and the initiation of the Ground Combat Vehicle program in its place. On 15 and 16 June, a blue-ribbon panel convened in Washington D.C. to determine the requirements for the Ground Combat Vehicle. It was concluded at this meeting that an Infantry Fighting Vehicle was to be the first vehicle variant fielded. Defense contractors were not allowed to attend but at least six in attendance were employed by defense companies that eventually bid on the GCV contract. On 23 June, Future Combat Systems was formally dissolved and many programs including the Manned Ground Vehicle program were canceled with it.\\"Future Combat System (FCS) Program Transitions to Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization\\", US DoD, 23 June 2009. On 19 October, contractors turned up for a U.S. Army organized industry day event in Dearborn, Michigan to learn about the requirements. In late October PEO Integration was established to oversee subsystems of BCT Modernization including the GCV. On 24 November, a second industry day was held in Warren, Michigan. After much delay, reviews necessary for continuation were held throughout February, in Washington D.C. The GCV review was officially passed on 25 February and a request for proposal (RfP) was issued the same day. It was revealed in the RfP that the GCV would be a cost-plus contract. Companies had 60 days to respond, but this offer was extended an additional 25 days. In May, a \\"red team\\" was formed to curtail the GCVs 7-year development schedule. By the 21 May deadline, four proposals were submitted. On 1 July, management of the GCV was transferred from PEO Integration to PEO Ground Combat Systems with Andrew DiMarco as project manager. For fiscal year 2011, the U.S. Army intended to spend $934 million of the $2.5 billion allocated for BCT Modernization to develop the GCV. Reportedly, $100 million was removed from the yet to be approved budget but the budget continued to reported as $934 million. On 25 August the Army retracted its request for proposals after the red team assembled in May recommended that the Army either upgrade the existing ground vehicle fleet or rewrite the requirements. ;Projections The Technology Development Phase (or Milestone A) was to begin with the award of up to three vehicle contracts awarded in late Fiscal Year 2010 under the Technology Development Phase Contract. A Preliminary Design Review would follow in mid FY 2012. The U.S. military planned to spend $7.6 billion during Milestone A. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase (or Milestone B) was to begin with two prototype development contracts awarded in the beginning of Fiscal Year 2013 under the Engineering & Manufacturing Development Contract. Shortly thereafter, an Interim Critical Design Review would follow in Mid-FY 2013. After a nearly two-year manufacturing period the first prototypes would be manufactured Mid-FY 2015 after which a Critical Design Review and a Production Readiness Review would occur in FY 2015 and FY 2016 respectively. The Low Rate Initial Production Phase (or Milestone C) was to begin with a low-rate production contract awarded in mid Fiscal Year 2016 under the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract. Less than two years after the contract award LRIP would begin. After more testing a battalion- sized team would be attained in FY 2018 followed by a brigade-sized arsenal in FY 2019. If a Full-Rate Production Decision was attained, full-rate production would begin. The U.S. military planned on procuring 1,450 IFVs at a total program cost of $40 billion. ;Competitors There were four known competing contractors for the Ground Combat Vehicle contract.

Revised program  In September, Alion Science and Technology was awarded a $23,828,000 contract modification for the development of systems supporting GCV development. This contract was tendered by the U.S. Air Force and $2,180,000 in funds was obligated at the time of the award. An industry day was held 1 October in Dearborn, Michigan. The Army reduced its requested FY 2011 budget to $462 million. Advanced Defense Vehicle Systems, General Dynamics Land Systems, and BAE Systems announced their intention of re- competing soon after the cancellation. A revised RfP was to be issued around 27 October 2010. Military officials met on 20 October to discuss delaying the RfP to allow leaders time to deliberate about requirements. The panel recommended releasing the RfP without delay but George Casey said he would need time to commit to a decision. Senior leaders at the meeting felt that the 27 October target could be met. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested deferring development of the GCV until after 2015. The revised RfP was issued on 30 November. ADVS announced its decision to not submit a proposal. ADVS decision not to compete was stated to be that the vehicle's slow procurement timeline was not suited to \\"ADVS‚Äô rapid development and fielding capabilities\\". Up to three cost-plus contracts were to be awarded nine months after the RfP was released. An acquisition decision memorandum on 17 August allowed the program to award technology development contracts. It also initiated two reviews of alternatives including a revised analysis of alternatives and an analysis of non-developmental vehicles. The 18 August, the Army awarded technology development contracts to only BAE and GDLS. BAE was awarded $450 million while GDLS was awarded $440 million. SAIC followed up with a bid protest on 26 August further delaying GCV development. It believed the evaluations process was flawed and the evaluation took factors into consideration that were not stated in the request for proposal. ;Projections $884 million was requested by the U.S. Army to fund the GCV in FY 2012. The technology development phase was to be a 24 months long, 3 months shorter than the previous plan. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase was to be 48 months long. The Army planned on acquiring 1,874 GCVs to replace Bradleys in 16 active and 8 National Guard Heavy Brigade Combat Teams.BAE offers 70-ton GCV - Armytimes.com, March 27, 2012 ;Milestone A Namer APC during Non-Developmental Vehicle assessment. CV-9035 demonstrator vehicle for the Non-Developmental Vehicle assessment. Testing of commercially available combat vehicles began in May 2012 at Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range to prepare the Army for Milestone B. The Non-Developmental Vehicle analysis assessed five vehicles, the M2A3 Bradley, Namer, CV-9035, a double v-hulled M1126 Infantry Carrier Vehicle and a turretless Bradley. The tests, completed on May 25, were carried out to determine what vehicle variants and configurations fulfill the Army's needs. The Army found that although the vehicles assessed met some GCV requirements, no currently fielded vehicle met enough without needing significant redesign.Army, industry slam CBO‚Äôs scathing GCV report - DoDBuzz.com, April 4, 2013 ;Competitors There were three known competing contractors for the Ground Combat Vehicle contract. *BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, QinetiQ North America, Saft Group, and iRobot were working jointly on development *General Dynamics Land Systems led a team that included Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon *SAIC led a team that include Boeing, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, and Rheinmetall Defence (not awarded EMD contract) ;Milestone C A Milestone C decision could have been made in 2019. =Weight issues= In November 2012, estimates of the GCV's weight, depending on armor packages, put the General Dynamics entry vehicle at 64‚Äì70 tons, and the BAE Systems entry vehicle at 70‚Äì84 tons. This made the planned infantry fighting vehicle designs heavier than the M1 Abrams tank. The reason was the vehicle had to have enough armor to protect a squad of nine troops from all battlefield threats (from rocket-propelled grenades to IEDs) as good as or better than other vehicles can protect against specific threats individually. This worked against the vehicle; as weight increases, cost goes up and maneuverability goes down. The contractors worked to bring the weight down.. The Army maintained that heavy armor was needed to protect the squad from acceleration forces that come with an underside blast, and that thicker underbelly plates and V-shaped hulls do not give enough protection. More armor would come from the vehicle being larger for more internal space for the soldiers, and to allow for features such as floating floors for blast deflection and extra headroom. The Army also said heavy weight would not affect deployability because the Bradley it was planned replace already requires strategic airlift transport aircraft. Both contractors claimed their designs were below the 70‚Äì84 tons expectation of what the GCV will weigh. BAE's vehicle weighed 60‚Äì70 tons, based on modular armor package, and a 20 percent margin for weight increase the Army had planned for future upgrades would bring it up to 84 tons. General Dynamic's vehicle with a diesel engine weighed 62 tons in its most heavily armored configuration, which increased to 76 tons with the 20 percent future upgrade margin. Removing protection for easier air transportation would have reduced it to 56 tons. The Army's consideration to slow down the GCV development program gave time to the companies to refine their designs and reduce weight. One way would have been to reduce squad size. A nine-man squad has been identified as best for being able to fight with the possibility of taking casualties with single-vehicle transportability. With a three-man crew, the GCV had to carry 12 men. A greater number of lighter IFVs that carry fewer soldiers would have similar carrying capacity and combined costs and weight to planned GCV numbers. Another way would be an advance in armor designs. Lighter and stronger armor materials had not made radical progressions in recent history, and domestic active protection intercept systems were not yet mature. Foreign systems like the Israeli Trophy had seen combat but cannot yet intercept tank shells. The GCV program originally included an APS, but was then delayed as a feature for later upgrades. The last effort to replace the Bradley had been Future Combat Systems from 2003 to 2009, which developed a vehicle that relied on sensors to avoid danger and an APS in place of heavy armor. It was too ambitious for the time and the vehicle's weight had grown from 19 tons to 30 tons by the time it was cancelled.. Vehicles=BAE Systems The BAE Systems Ground Combat Vehicle design had a steel-core hull and an integrated electronic network capability with embedded intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance equipment. Its turret was unmanned. The centerpiece of the vehicle was its simplified drive train. It was propelled by a Hybrid Electric Drive (HED), which was developed by Northrop Grumman, that produced 1,100 kW of electricity. Advantages to it are fewer components and lower volume and weight compared to current power plants. The transmission was 40 percent smaller and the drive train had half the moving parts. The hybrid drive train cost 5 percent more than a mechanical system, but had a 20 percent reduction in life- cycle cost. The electric drive allows for smoother low-speed operation and less noise. The vehicle burned 20 percent less fuel while running, with 4.61 gallons (17.45 liters) per hour used while stationary. It had a top speed of 43 mph (70 km/h), could go from 0 to 20 mph (32.18 km/hr) in 7.8 seconds, and had a range of with a 255-gallon fuel capacity. Disadvantages to the BAE design included a weight of 70 tons and fuel efficiency of only 0.73 mpg. It was argued that big, heavy vehicles are not practical in urban combat and that the infrastructure of urban and third-world countries should limit the vehicle's weight to 45 tons. Others said that urban warfare tactics have become so lethal that only vehicles of this size can survive.BAE Systems releases details of hybrid tank - Gizmag.com, November 22, 2012 BAE integrated the Artis Iron Curtain active protection system to defeat incoming rockets and missiles before they can hit the vehicle. The Army conducted tests on the system in April 2013, and the it successfully passed all tests. A prototype system for the vehicle to drive in low visibility conditions was also tested. A Humvee with blacked-out windows drove through a smoke-filled mock town with the system safely, even though visibility was completely obscured.Undeterred By Possible Delays, BAE Continues Ground Combat Vehicle Development - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, 28 August 2013 In August 2013, the BAE GCV's hybrid electric drive completed 2,000 miles of testing on a fully integrated ‚ÄúHotbuck‚Äù mobility platform. The Hotbuck is a stationary test stand that simulates real-life environments and terrain and puts actual miles on the HED system. Under BAE's own timeline, the testing was completed four months ahead of schedule. Developing and testing actual hardware was not a program requirement for the Technology Development (TD) phase, but BAE Systems chose to demonstrate the fuel efficiency and performance of a hybrid system.BAE Systems Ground Combat Vehicle Hybrid Electric Drive successfully completed 2000 miles testing - Armyrecognition.com, 27 August 2013 Although dramatic funding cuts for the GCV program in January 2014 put the very completion of the acquisition effort in jeopardy, funding remained for research on a hybrid- electric propulsion system. The BAE GCV's hybrid-electric engine is more fuel efficient, has fewer moving parts, and has faster acceleration than ordinary engines. While powering a vehicle concept that reached 70 tons proved impractical, its benefits of providing power for onboard electronics, silent overwatch, and short, stealthy movements are still promising. BAE has pledged to support future Army developmental efforts with technologies from their GCV entry.Hopes Dim for BAE‚Äôs ‚ÄòGreen‚Äô Combat Vehicle - DoDBuzz.com, 22 January 2014 On 18 July 2014, BAE Systems was awarded a $7.9 million study contract for technical, cost, and risk assessments to utilize the GCV TD phase integrated hybrid-electric propulsion and mobility subsystems Automotive Test Rig (ATR) and the hybrid-electric integrated propulsion subsystem (Hotbuck) for the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV) effort.Army Attempts to Salvage GCV Technology Advances - Defensemedianetwork.com, 25 July 2014Army asks BAE Systems and General Dynamics to recycle GCV vetronics for Future Fighting Vehicle - Militaryaerospace.com, 18 August 2014 General Dynamics GCV On 31 October 2013, General Dynamics successfully completed a preliminary design review of their GCV IFV design.

The song acts as both Crystal Castles and Health's debut singles in addition to being the first single from the album Crystal Castles. It was first released on August 13, 2007 by Trouble Records, accompanied by the B-side \\"XxzxcuZx Me\\". The song is a re-working of the Health original track of the same name written by the band members of Health for their eponymous debut album. It was re-written by Ethan Kath of Crystal Castles. Kath also produced the re-worked track. The song contains prominent electro and chiptune musical characteristics. The track consists of only three lyric lines and has been said to tell a story about the sadness and ennui one might experience when locked inside a Pac-Man maze for eternity. \\"Crimewave\\" achieved critical praise from most contemporary music critics. Critics complimented the song's originality and emotion it brought to the electronic music scene. The single was accompanied by a music video upon its re-release in 2008. The track was performed by Crystal Castles at All Points West Music & Arts Festival in 2009. \\"Crimewave\\" was used in Gossip Girl No.1 and features on its companion soundtrack OMFGG ‚Äì Original Music Featured on Gossip Girl No. 1., and was later featured on the in-game radio for the 2016 video game Watch Dogs 2. Background Originally written and composed by the members of Health for their self-titled debut album, \\"Crimewave\\" was re-written and re-worked by Ethan Kath of Crystal Castles to act as both bands' debut singles as well as the first single from Crystal Castles' self-titled debut album. The reworking significantly lengthened the original song while retaining the prominence of the original vocals by Health. After originally being released on August 13, 2007, as a single backed with Crystal Castles' \\"XxzxcuZx Me\\", \\"Crimewave\\" was re-released on September 21, 2008, to coincide with Crystal Castles' North American tour with Health., again in single form but with Crystal Castles' \\"Alice Practice\\" replacing \\"XxzxcuZx Me\\" as the B-side. The single's cover artwork was also modified for the re-release, with the white background being replaced with a black background. Composition Musically, \\"Crimewave\\" builds from now-retro electroclash to a clattering mix of drums. The song consists of simple, catchy beats backed by lively video game sounds. \\"Crimewave\\" was composed as breezy, off-kilter electropop. Paul Lester from The Guardian likened \\"Crimewave\\" to the sound of Ian Curtis from Joy Division intoning blankly over Kraftwerk at their most synthetic. The song consists only of the following lyrics which are repeated vocally by Health in monotone throughout the song: \\"Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips, but lights press the soft skin to rough hands\\".https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Crystal- Castles-HEALTH-2/Crimewave \\"Crimewave\\" follows a chord progression of Em, C, Am, Bm, Em, C, G, Bm. \\"Crimewave\\" is set in the time signature of common time with an uptempo metronome of 121 beats per minute. Critical reception Mehan Jayasuriya of PopMatters positively reviewed the \\"Crimewave\\" saying that it \\"might be a remix, but it sure as hell doesn't sound like one, a testament to the fact that keyboard wizard Ethan Kath manages to dress the song up in the Castles' trademark icy hedonism.\\" Brian Reid of Prefix Magazine commented that \\"Crimewave\\" shows the depth of Crystal Castles as much more than just a dance-focused electro band. Reid went on to say: \\"On the tail end of 'Crimewave,' Kath lets vocal loop persist while knocking the bottom out of the track, resulting in a moment of startling beauty.\\" Reid also said that \\"Crimewave\\" allows its listener to hear an emotive digital voice display a fragility usually lacking in electronic music. Colm Larkin from Clash reviewed the \\"brilliant track\\" saying: \\"Amongst a luxurious electro bassline, measured beat and achingly pretty electronic melodies, the robotic voice is scratched and split so the pleading words take on a monotonous, unknowable tone. The result combines cool electronic detachment with an undercurrent of torrid emotion, like hearing a robot plead for its life. Yet there's also that beat that helps you forget the blubbering tin man and want to dance to genuinely innovative and exciting electronic music that does have a heart.\\" Andy Peterson from Contactmusic.com said that \\"Crimewave\\" made Crystal Castles \\"critically untouchable\\". The track was also highlighted as one of the album's strongest elements by Jamil Ahmad of musicOMH. The song was further deemed as one of the best dance tracks of the decade by Ricardo Baca of The Denver Post.

According to Hasbro, the vehicles from Shadows of the Empire are not used because the toy line targets collectors who are mostly familiar with the film series and the Clone Wars animated series. In late 2017, TakaraTomy announced a reboot of the line with new designs and higher price points to begin in March 2018 starting with Darth Vader, who transforms into a TIE Advanced X1. Critical reaction Merging both franchise's toy lines was \\"a natural fit\\".

It consists of a Z-shaped tube with open ends, filled with a liquid, and set on top of a spinning table. If the tube were straight, the liquid would immediately fly out one end or the other of the tube as it began to spin. By bending the ends of the tube back towards the center of rotation, a shift of the liquid away from center will result in the water level in one end of the tube rising and thus increasing the pressure in that end of the tube, and consequently returning the liquid to the center of the tube. By measuring the rotational speed and the distance from the center of rotation to the liquid level in the bent ends of the tube, the pressure reduction inside the tube can be calculated. Negative pressures, (i.e. less than zero absolute pressure, or in other words, tension) have been reported using water processed to remove dissolved gases.Smith, Andrew M. \\"Negative Pressure Generated by Octopus Suckers: A Study of the Tensile Strengths of Water in Nature,\\" J. exp.

History The orchestra was founded in 1953 under the name the New Symphony Association of Kingston. The first principal conductor was Graham George; he led the orchestra's debut concert of Joseph Haydn's The Creation on 12 April 1954 at The Grand Theatre with the Kingston Choral Society and baritone James Milligan. For its first three years the orchestra performed only two concerts a year, but the number of concerts increased steadily beginning in 1957. Principal conductors for the next few years were William Hill (1957‚Äì1959), and Edouard Bartlett (1960‚Äì1965). The ensemble was renamed the Kingston Symphony in 1963 with the formation of a new umbrella organization the Kingston Symphony Association. Some of the concerts were held at the Kingston Gospel Temple. Alexander Brott was brought in as conductor in 1965, and during his tenure the orchestra was able to hire a number of professional string and wind players. Kingston's newly renovated Grand Theatre became the orchestra's main concert venue. Brian Jackson was hired as conductor in 1982, and remained in this post until 1991. By this time the Symphony was performing about twelve concerts per year. In 1992 Glen Fast took over as conductor. Under his direction, the KS made a change towards playing new works by Canadian composers. The orchestra has given the world premieres of Chan Ka Nin's Violin Concerto (1998); Marjan Mozetich's Piano Concerto (2000); Srul Irving Glick's last work, Isaiah (2002); John Burge's Clarinet Concerto (2004); Istv√°n Anhalt's The Tents of Abraham (2005); and Peter Paul Koprowski's Tapestries of Love: Symphony for Soprano and Orchestra (2007).

In 2008, the population was 11,424. It is located in Tappita Statutory District and situated along the Cestos River which borders Liberia with the Republic of C√¥te d'Ivoire, commonly called the Ivory Coast. People and Government The district is mainly composed of two ethnic groups, the majority being Krahn and the minority being Gio. The first Commissioner of the District since its declaration in 2003 was Hon. Alexander N. Tenty Sr. from Dewoblee, of the Zodru Chiefdom. He served from July 2004 ‚Äì 2010. The current Commissioner is Hon. Alexander Tenty, Sr who took over from Hon. Emmanuel N. Kar is from Kparblee town after the 2011 election. The headquarters of Kparblee Administrative District is Youkorway Old Town which has a population of a little over two thousand people. The only security found in the District is the Immigration with their office in Behwalay. A magisterial court was established sometimes in 2014 and is seated in Yourpea New Town. Current, Behwalay is among those rural cities to enjoy city status. Towns The District is composed of fifteen larger towns with seven smaller villages. Towns within Kparblee Administrative District are: #Youkorway #Beatuo #New Yourpea Town #Behwalay #Dubuzon #Kaylay #Dewoblee I #Dewoblee II #Kparblee Town #Zodru Town #Gueyea Gbayee-blee #Bah-blee #Karn-blee #Gayeplay #Tuzon #Yeah-blee #Tiah-blee Religion and Culture The first religious group to visit the District and become established is the Mid-Baptist. The missionaries were Teacher Walkins, Teacher Homes, and Teacher Crocmanaul along with Rev Sawi Kpou in the Town of Kparblee during the early 1950s. Due to the missionaries' visit and decision to establish a church in the Chiefdom at the time, all cultural and traditional practices were abolished by the citizens. Introduction what is now known as Kparblee Administrative District was formerly Kparblee chiefdom. It comprised the Gios and Krahns that coexisted in the past as one family. There was the intermarriage bond that kept them together. Their naming was borrowed from either ethnic group that was so unique. Both tribes bore the traditional names of one another. As a result of the intermarriage in the past, one could hardly distinguish the Krahns from the Gios in this part of Nimba until the senseless civil conflict. This Krahn- Gio solidarity played a major role in the selection of Coup members of the Peoples Redemption Council of 1980 that toppled the Tolbert Regime. The Council was made up of majority Gios and Krahns It was not until 1989 when the civil war changed the story. Kparblee District occupies a stretch of land from Beatuo to Kermablee, and shares boundary with the Gios Amalgamated Districts. In this district are Beatuo, Youkorway and Your pea New towns which comprise majority Gios with minute‚Äôs section being Krahns. These people prior to the war and even now are intermarried. Similarly, Zodru chiefdom which ends up in Behwallay from Gueyde is occupied by predominantly Krahns. The leadership evolved through several chiefs. From Gowah to Kraie, Nyonton Paye, Samuel Paye, Thomas Paye and Jimmie Tarlue then. This harmonious relationship continued until December 24, 1989 when the Liberian civil crises erupted through Butuo. The crises which claimed the lives of over one hundred and fifty thousand people left behind many scars as a result of mass destruction of lives and properties perpetrated by actors from two ethnic groups of the same district who are living in the same district but with grudge for each other. Both groups targeted one another based on ethnic solidarity. For example, forces loyal to the NPFL who drew their strength and command structure from the Gio section of the district burned down Villages and carried gruesome killings of other Krahn sections of the district. MODEL, a revenge force consisting mainly of the Krahn ethnic group also did likewise in their bid to retake Kparblee district. Villages were also burned and lives lost gruesomely. Kparblee district changed hands twice between the NPFL and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia MODEL, with the later coming through the Liberian Ivorian Border. This change in hands caused more damages to lives and properties within the district. Families went against families; children went again parents on opposing sides. Another rift in the district can be attributed to the unceremonious removal of the District seat to Yourkorway from its original point of Kparblee, without the input of Kparblee citizens. This also has led to resentment and serious unfriendly interactions. Many times Kparblee citizens hold this as conspiracy against them by the planners of the act. There was no hearing at the legislature as such that could authenticate the views of all. To further authenticate the thoughts of the people from Kparblee, during the Gyude Bryant led administration, series of confidence building trips were made to the district through the Graie Behwallay route. The delegations only stopped in Yourkorway and Behwallay under the pretense that there was no other town beyond here that point and there was no road leading anywhere. The discouragement of the delegation cost Kparblee dearly that today the name of Kparblee is deleted from the map of the district. This is a wound in the hearts of the people from Zodru chiefdom. To the people of Kparblee, this was a revenge targeted at the town since the framers of the new act have succeeded in removing the seat to Yourkorway. Fingers pointed to some members of the leadership at the time which failed to address itself to the matter and has left wounds in the hearts of one section. Realizing the impediment that these may have on the achievement of the developmental goals of the new leadership under the gavel of Peter Kangbe, a peace building and reconciliation initiative is being proposed as the surest way forward for development in the district. The reason is that this reconciliation will lead the way to the peace and Reconciliation between Nimba and Grand Gedeh at large. This should be the priority project of the present administration which, if achieved will be a plus for the National Government. This is why this project is important if the two sectors must co-exist. PROJECT OVERVIEW The Kparblee District Development Association (KPADDA) Inc is seeking for a grant of one hundred and sixteen thousand ninety nine hundred and fifty cent United States dollars (USD$116,099.50) for the purpose of reconciliation and peace building in the district. This grant will be used to reunite the people of Kparblee district through series of reconciliation conferences and peace building initiatives in the district. Stakeholder‚Äôs conference will be used as a medium to exchange views and to encourage the input of all grass rooters and elders of the district. A District Peace Plan (DPP) will be adopted at the end of the process with a District Peace Council (DPC) put in place. This district peace council will rely on the community peace animators that will work with community conflict management teams that to ensure that the peace plan is followed. The term of reference of the conflict management team will be to reduce litigation in the district and serve as first point of contact for conflicts in the communities. This team will work with the courts in the district to discourage citizens going to court with one another. Reconciliatory feasts and tournaments will be held between town and chiefdoms within the district. All are aimed towards reconciling the people of the district. 552264 STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS The stake holders in this process can be categorized into three segments. The People of Glarlay, Behwallay and Dubuzon are on the one hand, the people of Kparblee, and Youkoway are on another while the Gios and Krahns are on the final hand. The attempted murder of Manniadey from Behwallay led to the killing of Mamadee Fofana, a driver and a popular citizen of Glarlay by an AFL soldier believed to be from Dubuzon. Another version of the saga was one Dennis from Behwallay encouraged the killing of the Gios when he spoke the local vernacular of the fleeing villagers to encourage them to come back only to be killed. Their return resulted in mass death that escalated to the point that the district found itself in revenge killings that has divided this it today. To date these towns still hold it against one another. For example, in 2006 there was a teachers training program organized through the Accelerated Learning Program project. This training was held in Ganta with over sixty teachers from the entire district. To our dismay, teachers from Beatuo and other Gio speaking communities were afraid to sleep with those from the Krahn sector in the hotel rooms. This if not properly curtailed will lead to total collapse of peace in the district. One critical issue affecting the district also is the unceremonious removal of the district seat from Kparblee to Yourkorway. This has not gone down well with Behwallay and Kparblee citizens. They feel unfairly treated as their town was the original district seat. They believe there was no justifiable reason to remove it, and if there was, the process leading to it was not participatory not just Kparblee but, the people that area fell they were not consulted in the removal of the District seat from Kparblee to Yourkorway. It is strongly believed that the manipulator of this process hails from Yourkorway. No matter what explanation is provided, Kparblee people will find it difficult to accept As a result of the above, Kparblee citizens feel reluctant for development projects to be undertaken in Yourkorway For example, during the periods Reign of the interim Government led by Gyude Bryant, one major attempt was made by UNMIL and other stakeholders in the peace process as a fact finding mission. This delegation travelled through Graie to Yourkorway. STRATEGIC GOALS & OBJECTIVES STRATEGIC GOAL: The Strategic goal of the project is to ensure coexistence of the people of Kparblee district. The overall objective of this proposal is to have genuine reconciliation and sustainable peace in Kparblee district (formerly Kparblee chiefdom). This objective will be achieved through several approaches. Stakeholder‚Äôs conferences will mark the beginning of the process. At this conference stake holders will be expected to present their hurts. These stories will then compiled and serve as the agenda for the general reconciliation conference to be held at the district seat. This agenda will consider the input of traditional leaders, opinion leaders, youth, women groups and local Government leader. At the end of the process the Reconciliation agenda will be presented to the leadership of the district for implementation using those traditional approaches. Prepared by Marcus Sawi Kpou Transportation A road was first built in the District in 1975 by Sika and since then has not been rehabilitated. While the transporting of chiefs, messengers and security personnel was still going on in the District at the time it was a chiefdom, the whole idea was discouraged by a young graduate from the BWI called Jonathan V. Dayee from Kparblee Town in 1976. Institutions One of the oldest institutions in the district is Kweyeah Memorial Institute (KMI) in Kparblee. Currently, the District has about nine schools of which two are full Junior High. According to the government MDA 2008-2012, Kweyeah Memorial Institute should be a Full High School while the Samuel Kayon Doe in Youkorway Old Town the Headquarters be a Technical High School. Agriculture Prior to the war, Kparblee District was one of Nimba County's strong hopes for agricultural products such as cocoa, coffee, plantains, etc. According to the Commissioner, the district was able to benefit some $100,000 USD in a grant project from the government which is intended for agricultural activities. The project began sometime in February 2012 with Kparblee town benefiting from the entire $100,000. Elections Kparblee District now forms part of the Electoral District number six in Nimba County after the demarcation exercise conducted by the National Elections Commission (NEC) in 2011. According to the results of the 2011 Voter's Registration exercise, Kparble District registered about 5,741 voters. Other communities which make up the district along with Kparblee are the Boe and Quilla Administrative District, and the Gblor and Gbear Chiefdom. Kparblee shares boundaries with these mentioned communities. Due to the ongoing civil crises in La Cote Ivoire, Kparblee has received a total of six thousand Ivorian refugees. The citizens of Kpablee Administrative District residing in Monrovia and its environs have once again gathered to move the district forward. According to the Chairman of the Kparblee District Development Association (KPADDA), the organization will be conducting its first general elections with a completed constitution. The organization has set up an Electoral Commission and those on the commission are as follows: * Hon. Moses B. Zayee Sr. Chairman * Hon. Ruth J.

Biography Unitopia began when a mutual friend introduced Trueack and Timms after realizing the two had similar musical tastes. In late 1996, the duo began work on a track which was to become \\"Take Good Care\\" and a songwriting partnership developed that led to the band's debut album More Than a Dream, which included contributions from conductor/arranger Timothy Sexton and the Adelaide Art Orchestra, Pat Schirippa, Constantine Delo, Bradley Polain and Ian 'Polly' Politis. The album was independently launched in October 2005 to a sell out audience at The Cavern Club, Adelaide. Further live work followed in Australia, including supporting Daryl Braithwaite and playing the Norwood Food and Wine Festival. In March 2006, Canadian label Unicorn Records re-released More Than a Dream internationally. Wishing a consistent team both live and in the studio, Trueack and Timms recruited Adelaide instrumentalists Matt Williams (guitar/vocals), Monty Ruggiero (drums), Shireen Khemlani (bass) and Tim Irrgang (percussion) to complete the Unitopia line-up. Trueack and Timms then started writing in earnest new material for their next album, The Garden. In February 2008, Unitopia signed a worldwide publishing deal with Shock Music Publishing. In July 2008, the track \\"Lives Go Round\\" from More Than a Dream was included on the CPR Volume 3 compilation CD. In August 2008, Unitopia signed a 3-album deal with InsideOut Music. On 18 November 2008, InsideOut Music released Unitopia's second CD, The Garden, internationally, a double CD with 15 tracks and over 100 minutes of music. According to Review Busters \\"This double disc release is defiantly one for the ages. Unitopia offers a unique blend of progressive rock with some symphonic parts that are incredible. If you never heard of this band then you will want to pick up everything they have to offer, The Garden is a non stop ride into a progressive sound that is easy on the ears, yet at the same time it offers everything you would have ever wanted from a progressive release.\\" Shireen Khemlani and Mike Stewart left in 2009 but the band was joined by Shaun Duncan on fretless and fretted bass, and Peter Raidel on saxophone. With this new lineup Unitopia released their third album Artificial in 2010. Jones, Duncan and Raidel were replaced, respectively, by David Hopgood, Craig Kelly and Ian Ritchie, who performed on the More Than A Garden Of Dreams tour of Europe in 2010 which included Summer's End Festival, a progressive rock festival in England. In 2012 with Ritchie replaced by Daniel Burgess on saxophone, the band released its fourth album Covered Mirror Vol. 1: Smooth As Silk, a cover album containing interpretations of classic progressive rock tracks. The band dissolved shortly thereafter. According to Trueack, he and Timms agreed to split demos for a planned double album. Trueack, with Unitopia members Matt Williams, Tim Irrgang and David Hopgood, assembled a new band called United Progressive Fraternity (also involving Guy Manning and Steve Layton among others) and released an album titled Fall In Love with the World. The band's sound continues in the vein of Unitopia, with some notably heavier passages; Trueack's lyrics have also progressed, further exploring his concerns with environmental matters and mysticism. Timms formed a new band called Southern Empire, who released their debut album in 18 March 2016 release. Trueack has stated that he would like to work with Timms again but Timms insisted that this would never happen. In July 2016 Timms and Trueack put their differences aside and reconnected. They are currently working on the remastering of the More than a Dream album and adding unreleased songs for an extended box set. They have also written a brand new song especially written for the set, called Dream Complete. Timms and Trueack have also put a band together called U.N.I.T. dB. This a special acoustic tour band that is made up of Southern Empire, Unitopia, Resistor, and United Progressive Fraternity. Southern Empire were playing gigs in Adelaide in February and March 2017, and touring Europe between September and October 2017. Meanwhile, Trueack is working with Steve Unruh on the next UPF albums called Loss and Hope, collaborating with artists such as Steve Hackett, Jerry Marotta, Colin Edwin, Nick Magnus, Chris Lebled, Jon Davison, Charlie Cawood, Lisa Wetton, Michelle Young, Angus Kay, George Perdikis, Hasse Froberg, Fraternity Symphonic Orchestra (60 piece) and along with some of the biggest names in the environmental space, the album is expected to have a lot interest. The album will be released in Feb 2019. Trueack is also working with Chris Lebled on a chill album called The Romantic.

Also at that time, he pursued his passion for performing by re-creating a Genesis tribute show, \\"The Genesis Touch\\". The group consistently played to packed houses, but had to disband due to Mark's interstate employment. While living in Sydney, Mark began his song writing career with local producer, Matt Coxhead, penning two songs, \\"Time For Change\\" and \\"This Life\\". Returning to Adelaide in 1996, Mark was introduced to Sean Timms by a mutual friend, who noticed the similarities in their musical tastes and personality. After a night on the town, the two began a song writing partnership. The first of these songs was an early version of \\"Take Good Care\\". Soon realising that the songs they were writing had commercial potential they continued to write together whenever possible. Mark convinced Sean that playing live was the best way to fine-tune and promote their music. They recruited some musicians and proceeded to form the rest of the live line- up that is Unitopia. Since the formation of the band, Mark has also had several other opportunities to perform, most notably the John Lennon memorial concert on the anniversary of his death in late 2005. Although still working as an executive, Mark plans to one day make music his full-time occupation. He is married to his wife of 35 years Cheryl, and they have two daughters, Holly (who has a cameo appearance on Justify) and Brittany. Sean Timms Sean Timms owns and operates Timms Tunes, audio/music post production facilities. He is an engineer, composer, arranger and producer with credits in the film and advertising industry. Timms started on piano at 10 and developed an interest in keyboards and synthesizers after his father bought him a copy of Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Centre of the Earth LP when he was 14. At 16 he bought his first synthesizer. He joined a band with some of his school mates and proceeded to make an income from doing cabaret work. By his early 20s, Sean was in demand as a first call session player. During this time he gigged up to 6 nights a week and studied jazz at Adelaide College where he met Monty Ruggiero. A chance meeting with a local producer introduced Sean to a recording studio. Starting as a first call session player, he quickly became an in-house arranger, composer & programmer. In 1989, Timms was asked to perform with Ross Wilson to promote his Dark Side of the Man album. This subsequently led to a stint in Mondo Rock, performing their latest release \\"Why Fight It\\" and their back catalogue. He also performed at a live televised event, Oz Music 90 at the Sydney Entertainment Centre performing to 19,000 people on the same bill as Crowded House & Kate Ceberano. Partnering with another post production studio in 1995, he spent 4 years developing his skills composing for the advertising industry. During this time he met Mark Trueack. Not getting enough satisfaction from a joint venture, Sean decided to open his own facility, naming it Timms Tunes. During this time Sean scored the music to two feature films. In 1999, Timms Tunes relocated to a character laden former church building. Timms continues to compose for many national and international clients such as Bakers Delight, Mitsubishi, Mazda, BMW, Home Hardware and Wendy's. He also works as a composer for Disney and has scored music for film projects including The Book Keeper and Gargoyle, two highly awarded animated films produced by Anifex. In April 2007, Sean married Amanda. They had their first child in November 2009. Matt Williams Matt Williams was born 1970 in Adelaide and began playing guitar at the age of 10. Concentrating only on finger style acoustic guitar until graduating from high school, he then moved to electric guitar and started learning and imitating the styles of Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Nuno Bettencourt and Frank Gambale. In his early 20s, Matt toured with popular original band Fire 'n Ice around Australia and the United States which helped develop his on stage persona and soloing technique. Now living back in Adelaide, Matt is an in demand session guitarist and engineer/producer who manages the client base at Fat Trax Recording Studios. He also plays around Adelaide with a Joe Satriani tribute show and the local rock outfit Fighter Pilot. Tim Irrgang Tim Irrgang began studying drums in 1986, and tuned percussion in 1992. He completed his Bachelor of Music (Hons) in 1996. During this time he gained experience playing in the Adelaide University Wind Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, Big Band, The Adelaide Connection (jazz vocal group), and The Elder Conservatorium Symphony Orchestra. In 96 he spent a month at ISSU University, Yogyarkata, Indonesia, with fellow Adelaide percussionists on a cultural exchange. While at University, Tim & fellow students formed a quartet called The Rhythm Works. They played at the 98 Fringe Festival, performed live on radio and TV, were actively involved in the ASME National Conference in 2001, and are currently part of the Musica Viva in Schools programme. In 2006 they toured Australia and Singapore. In December 1999 Tim traveled to South Africa with the Australian Aboriginal Jazz Connection ‚Äì Warkala, to perform at WOMAD ‚Äì Living Treasures Festival in Durban, as well as The Standard Bank Jazz Festival in Mamelodi & also performances in Pretoria and Johannesburg. The tour also included performances with some of the local artists. As part of the Hormingo Ensemble, Tim was involved in the Elder Conservatorium Evening and Lunchtime Concert series, Sunday Salon at the Festival Theatre and the Bundaleer Forest Music Festival. They were the first group to be part of the Musica Viva, Menage Series. In 2001 they travelled to Malaysia with state trade delegates to provide entertainment for official functions held in Kuala Lumpur and Penang. Tim has played with the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra as part of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts with their Symphony Under the Stars in 2004. Further work followed, including The Australian Ballet, The Zep Boys \\"Led Zeppelin Tribute\\" and The ASO's Masters Series. He continues to work with the orchestra on a casual basis. Tim has also had the opportunity to perform with The South Australian Police Band, Etype jazz, Lucifer's Lounge, Cathie Renner, J.C. Jazz, The Australian Girls Choir, , Boogiemen, Flat on Your Bacherach, Akhter Jahan, and Rataque. Events include the Glenelg Jazz Festival, Adelaide Fringe, Cabaret & Arts Festivals, Bundaleer Forest Music Festival, Come Out Festival, Tour Down Under, Tasting Australia, and WOMADelaide. In 2005 Tim was adjudicator for percussion competitions at the National Band Championships, and performed for Cirque Du Soleil \\"Quidam\\" for the majority of the Adelaide season. Tim's current performing commitments are with United Progressive Fraternity, The Liars Bench, Fig Jam, The Bob Johnson Big Band, TWIT (Thompson, Whitney, Irrgang Trio), and The Rhythm Works. Tim also tutors privately at some of Adelaide's leading colleges, and has also been employed by Adelaide University to tutor in the Diploma of Education (percussion workshops) and CASM (Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music).

Background and publication During his youth in Chicago, Ernest Hemingway's family spent summers at Windemere on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey, Michigan. Hemingway's father, who was a doctor, taught him to hunt, fish, and camp in the woods and lakes of Northern Michigan as a young boy.Beegel (2000), 63‚Äì71 In 1921, Hemingway married Hadley Richardson and was posted to Paris a few months later as international correspondent for The Toronto Star.Desnoyers, Megan Floyd. \\"Ernest Hemingway: A Storyteller's Legacy\\" JFK Library. Retrieved September 30, 2011 In Paris he befriended Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, Ford Madox Ford, and John Dos Passos.Reynolds (1995), 36 Pound's influence extended to promoting the young author; in 1923 he commissioned work from Hemingway for the modernist series Pound was editing.Cohen (2003), 107‚Äì108 In 1924, during one of Hemingway's most productive periods, he wrote eight short stories, including \\"The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife\\".Benson (1983), 105 The stories were combined with the earlier vignettes produced for Pound, and submitted for publication to Boni & Liveright in New York,Mellow (1992), 188 who accepted the work in March 1925.Mellow (1992), 282‚Äì283 The story was included in Hemingway's collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories published in October 1938, and in two collections of short stories published after his death, The Nick Adams Stories (1972) and The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vig√≠a Edition (1987).Baker (1972), 412; Oliver (1999), 394 Plot summary Nick Adams' father, Dr. Adams, hires a crew of Native Americans to remove the four large beech logs from the lake's log boom that drifted up on his beach. Dick Boulton, his son Eddy, and Billy Tabeshaw, come through the back gate from the woods, bringing cant hooks, axes and a crosscut saw to cut the logs into cord wood. Boulton compliments Dr. Adams on the timber he is stealing from the logging company; Dr. Adams asserts that the logs are driftwood. Boulton washes a log in the surf, uncovers its mark and tells the doctor it belongs to White and McNally. The doctor becomes uncomfortable, decides not to saw up the logs, but Boulton says it makes no difference to him who the logs are stolen from. The two men engage in a verbal exchange, and when the doctor threatens Boulton with violence, Boulton mocks him. The doctor leaves the beach in anger, walking back to his cottage. He goes to his bedroom, sits on his bed, and stares with anger at a pile of medical journals still in their wrappers. In the adjacent room his wife lies on her bed with a Bible, a copy of Mary Baker Eddy's Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, and an issue of the Christian Science Quarterly. She asks whether he is going back to work; he explains that he had an altercation with Boulton. She asks whether he lost his temper and quotes Scripture, while, in the next room, the doctor sits on his bed and cleans his gun, pushing shells in and out of the magazine. When she presses him about the nature of the dispute he tells her Boulton owes for having his wife treated for pneumonia and does not want to have to work for the doctor. She expresses her disbelief of the explanation and the doctor leaves the house. His wife calls after him to send Nick to her. The doctor finds Nick sitting under a tree, reading a book, who tells his father he wants to go with him. Nick suggests they go into the woods to hunt squirrels.  Writing style Hemingway was inspired by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the principles of imagism to his own work. Pound's influence can be seen in the stripped-down, minimalist style characteristic in Hemingway's early fiction. Betraying his admiration for the older writer, he admitted that Pound \\"taught [me] more about how to write and how not to write than any son of a bitch alive\\". He also learned from James Joyce, who further instilled the idea of stripped down economic prose.Meyers (1985), 74, 126 Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism;Benson (1975), 285‚Äì287 biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to \\"get the most from the least, [to] prune language, [to] multiply intensities, [to] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth\\". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory: as Baker describes it, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.Baker (1972), 117 Themes and structure The story is a companion to \\"Indian Camp\\", the previous story in the collection, which also features Nick Adams and his father Dr. Adams. Unlike \\"Indian Camp\\", where Dr. Adams is shown in a position of power, in this story he is a cowardly man who reacts to confrontation with repressed anger.Tetlow (1992), 56 In \\"Indian Camp\\" young Nick witnesses his father performing a caesarian; Dr. Adams exposes his young son to childbirth and, unintentionally, to violent death ‚Äì an experience that causes Nick to equate childbirth with death.Tetlow (1992), 87 Howard Hannum explains the trauma of birth and suicide Hemingway paints in \\"Indian Camp\\" rendered a leitmotif that gave Hemingway a unified framework for the Nick Adams stories and is continued in \\"The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife\\" in direct counterpoint to the previous story.Hannum (2001), 92‚Äì94 The contrasts and similarities between the two stories are stark. In \\"The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife\\" the family lives in a spacious cottage, whereas in \\"Indian Camp\\" a family lives in a cramped shanty. The first is filled with silences, the second with violent screams. In this story, three men come from the Indian camp to the Adams's cottage; in the previous, Dr. Adams, Nick and his uncle visit the Indian camp. The central scenes of both stories occur indoors and involve sick women in bed; both women are married to unhappy, suicidal men (the husband in \\"Indian Camp\\" commits suicide in his bed with a razor; Dr. Adams sits on his bed and plays with his gun). Both stories end with Nick and his father leaving ‚Äì rowing away from the Indian camp in the first, walking into the woods to hunt in this story.Strong (1991), 85-87 ReferencesSources * Baker, Carlos (1972).

It is in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas. Geography The volcano has 7 peaks, set around a large crater of which the southern side appears to have collapsed. The highest peaks are located on the north-west side and have an elevation of INSIVUMEH and .Rodriguez. The U-shaped volcanic edifice opens south towards the coastal piedmont, creating both cold and temperate climatic zones within a relatively small area.Department of Protected Areas and Helvetas ProBosques, 2008 Within the edifice are hot springs as well as the headwaters of the rio Ocosito which flows into the Pacific Ocean. Ecological significance The volcano forms part of the Sierra Madre, hosting an abundance of endemic species such as the endangered Guatemalan Fir or \\"Pinabete\\" (Abies guatemalensis) and forming an integral part of one of the largest contiguous biological corridors of southwestern Guatemala. Bird species include the pink- headed warbler, black-capped siskin, highland guan, rufous-collared robin, white-breasted hawk, and rufous-browed wren. Cultural significance The volcano's ridgeline houses over 18 Mayan ceremonial altars, most of which are still actively used by local Mayan priests. The name Siete Orejas originates from the local name in the Mam language: Wuq Xinkan. According to locals, this name originated from a legend about a large boulder on one of the peaks. Recreational opportunities On clear days the ridgeline of the volcano has wide views of the surrounding area, from the city of Quetzaltenango, to San Marcos and the coastal piedmont, including views of volcanoes Santa Maria, Santiaguito, Tajumulco, and Tacana.

Originally, St. Peter's, the first Catholic church in New Brunswick was on Bayard Street consisted mostly of Irish Catholics, and was set up in 1829. The newer church building was built in 1865 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 25, 2005 for its significance in architecture. With  History  The first recorded visit of a Catholic priest to New Brunswick occurred in 1825, when a Fr. McDonough who was traveling from New York to Philadelphia stopped to visit a Catholic family here. That same year, Father John Powers, from St. Peter's Parish in New York City, came and celebrated Mass. He began offering Mass here monthly, first in a private home and then in a large room over a wheelwright's shop on George Street. In 1829, the Bishop of New York, John Dubois, sent Father Joseph Schneller to continue the monthly visits to New Brunswick. Bishop Dubois erected St. Peter & Paul Parish in 1829, and a simple brick church was built on Bayard Street in New Brunswick in 1831, although not without difficulty. Anti-Catholic sentiment made it necessary for Father Schneller to use creative means to obtain land for the new church. In 1833, Father Bernard McArdle became the first resident pastor in New Brunswick, and it was during his tenure that the New Brunswick Tornado of June 19, 1835 partially destroyed the church, which remained in use after being closed up with boards. Father John Rogers, an Irishman who came to America and became a priest at the invitation of Bishop Dubois, after meeting him in Dublin during the 1820s, became the first permanent resident pastor in 1845. In addition to his legendary pastoral zeal, Father Rogers is rightly considered the ‚Äúfounding pastor‚Äù of St. Peter's as we know it today. He began his tenure at St. Peter's by rescuing the church building from foreclosure, repairing and expanding it, and constructing the first parish school. However, this was only a foretaste of great things to come. With New Brunswick thriving and the Catholic population rapidly increasing, Father Rogers often traveled to surrounding towns to celebrate the sacraments. St. Peter's became the ‚ÄúMother Church‚Äù of Central Jersey, with missions throughout Middlesex and Somerset Counties. In 1853, property was purchased for a new and larger church on Somerset Street across from the campus of Rutgers College. The well-known Irish-American church architect Patrick Charles Keely was commissioned to design a new ‚Äúcathedral‚Äù. The present church was built from 1854 through 1865, with the cornerstone laid upon the completion of the lower church in 1856. In 1870, a magnificent chime of bells was installed, one of only three of its kind in New Jersey, which is still played on significant feasts and other special occasions. A sorely needed sacristy was added to the church in 1891. The current marble altar and reredos were installed in 1919 (the altar was reconfigured in 1967, in accordance with the liturgical reforms of Vatican II), and the stained-glass windows were replaced in 1950. In 1999, the current electronic organ was installed. The Lyceum building, constructed in 1920, served various needs of the parish and schools until 2009. The St. Peter's Rectory is a fine example of Greek Revival architecture which was built sometime before the parish acquired the Somerset Street property. It has been the home of every pastor since Father Rogers, as well as almost 75 other priests who have served St. Peter's over the past 150 years. Today, the rectory is home to the New Brunswick Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri, a community of priests and brothers who serve St. Peter's Parish, Catholic Campus Ministry at Rutgers, and other pastoral works in the Diocese of Metuchen. The Sisters of Charity of Convent Station were invited to staff the parish school in 1867, and a convent was constructed for the sisters next to the new church. The convent was enlarged in 1897, 1922 and again in 1952, in order to provide accommodations for thirty-five sisters. Sisters of Charity and sisters from other communities continued to reside there through 2004. After significant exterior restoration and a complete interior renovation, the convent building reopened in January 2010 as the new campus ministry center for Catholic students at Rutgers University. In 1892, a new parish school, which came to be known as Columbia Hall, was built near the original St. Peter's Hospital on Somerset Street. Next door, a new elementary school with a gymnasium was constructed in 1960, and a new high school replaced Columbia Hall in 1970. St. Peter's High School closed in 2007, and the elementary school, after merging briefly with St. Mary of Mount Virgin School, closed in 2010. The parish is currently exploring potential uses for the school buildings, which remain in serviceable condition. St. Peter's Hospital, founded out of the parish in the 1860s, moved from Somerset Street to its present location on Easton Avenue in the 1920s. Since then, the hospital has been rebuilt and greatly expanded, and it currently serves as the only Catholic hospital in the Diocese of Metuchen. In 1991, the basement church with its replica Lourdes grotto was converted to a parish hall. The basement was renovated in 2010-2011 for continued use as a parish hall to be shared by the parish and campus ministry communities, and to house new parish offices in previously underutilized space. The new offices and parish hall opened in December 2011. St. Peter the Apostle Parish celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2004. The 150th anniversary of the laying of the church's cornerstone was observed in 2006. In 2005, the Church, Rectory and Convent were placed on both the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places. Currently, a multi- phase restoration process is underway in order to preserve these beautiful buildings while also ensuring they will be safe and attractive spaces to be used by future generations of parishioners. Today, St. Peter's Parish is an active center of Catholic life in New Brunswick, just as it has been for over 175 years and will be for generations to come.

It was built in 1904 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 2003.  History  During the late 1800s, there was a large influx of Polish immigrants in the South River/Sayreville area ‚Äì the men found work in the brickyards and the women as needle operators in the factories on Whitehead Avenue. They worshiped at the only Catholic Church in the area at that time, was Our Lady of Victories in Sayreville. However, the community wanted to build a church where they could worship God in their native tongue, provide schooling for their children and carry on the traditions of their ancestors. An appeal was first made to the Bishop of Trenton by representatives of 252 families with 445 children in 1897. But this initial appeal was rejected. The community worked diligently through many years of negotiations with the Bishop. Finally, on November 2, 1902. Bishop McFaul approved the petition to establish a new parish and Our Lady of Ostrabrama was born. In December 1902, the Bishop assigned Father Joseph Regorowicz to be the founding pastor of St. Mary's. The first mass of the new parish was celebrated in the Bohi factory on Water Street on December 16, 1902. In the spring of 1903, the permanent site of the new church, the corner of Jackson Street and Whitehead Avenue was approved. The land was purchased for the sum of $2100. Construction of the new church began a few months later. Even after working long hours, the men of the parish came out with shovels and pickaxes to help with the excavation for the church foundation. In a little less than a year, a roof covered the basement and mass was now celebrated in the church. Additionally, the parish acquired a six-acre plot in April 1905 to serve as the parish cemetery. Father John Supenski was the second pastor of St. Mary's. His principal task was to complete the church building which up until this point had only been at the basement level. The projected cost was $4500 plus $3000 for the stained glass windows. Bishop McFaul blessed the church on October 11, 1908. The third pastor was Father John Pawlowski. During his administration, St. Mary's began its parochial school sessions conducted by the Felician sisters in four classrooms in the basement of the church. The white main altar was also installed during this time. Under the fourth pastor, Father Francis Czarnecki, the church purchased its first organ. Until that time, accordions provided the music for worship and devotion. In September 1919, five lots were purchased on the corner of Jackson Street and Holmes Avenue to be used for a new school. Father John Budzink became the fifth pastor. He began construction on the new school on June 17, 1927. On November 24, 1928, Bishop John J. McMahon assigned Father Maximilian Wujek to be the sixth pastor of St. Mary's. Father Wujek, a graduate of the Polytechnic Institute of Lwow, Poland, had thorough training in construction and was able to supervise the subsequent parish construction. Among the many projects he oversaw during his 41-year pastorate were the construction of a convent for the Bernadine sisters in 1940, the erection of the parish CYO building in 1960 and an additional wing to the school containing a new cafeteria and four classrooms. Father Wujek was elevated to Monsignor on September 16, 1938 by Pope Pius XI. After serving St. Mary's for 41 years, Monsignor Wujek retired in June 1969. The seventh pastor was Father Michael Kseniak who had served as an associate under Monsignor Wojek in the 1940s. Father Kseniak was responsible for many renovations to the school including carpeting the classrooms, buying new desks, enlarging the school library purchasing the visual aid equipment and renovating the whole structure. There was a disastrous fire in 1970 after which the whole building was refurbished, air conditioning was installed, the St. Anne's Chapel was erected in the basement and basilica bells were installed in the tower. He also razed the house used as a rectory and built a new rectory in 1979. He became a monsignor in June 1986 and served St. Mary's until February 1987. Father Vincent Nebus was installed as the eighth pastor in March 1987. A huge project undertaken by Father Nebus was the installation of an elevator in the church. He was also faced with addressing structural deterioration in the church due to the age of the church and the damage to the roof done by the fire years earlier. Under his leadership, the mortar on the interior church was redone, most of the exterior stone was removed and replaced, the chimney on the north side of the church was taken down and repaired and all the copper fixtures, including the small bell tower and downspouts were replaced with new copper fixtures. The artistic icon of our Lady of Czestochowa was also prepared and blessed to adorn our place of honor for Our Lady. Father Nebus retired in 1996. Reverend Robert L. Weil assumed the responsibilities of the ninth pastor in 1996. Father Bob served in this capacity for less than two years but continued the refurbishment work that needed to be done. Work on the Chapel of St. Anne was done including painting, additional lighting and window coverings. He also added the statue of St. Joseph which now adorns the upper church. Father Bob left in 1998 to become Chaplain of the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima at Washington, NJ. The Most Reverent Bishop Vincent de Paul Breen assigned the Reverend Stanley G. Gromadzki to be the Church's Administrator. Father Stan accepted this assignment on June 9, 1998 and was officially installed as St. Mary's tenth Pastor on September 8, 1999. Fr. Stan set to work immediately to make much needed restorations in the school building. New floors were installed, the classrooms were painted and fans were bought. The school auditorium which lay idle for many years was refurbished. He also took on the work needed to restore the entire lower level of the church, including updating the Senior's Room and the Music Room. During his tenure, St. Mary's celebrated its Centennial and Fr. Stan oversaw not only the planning for this celebration but also the work to ensure the church was in good shape for this milestone celebration. These are but a few of the large projects Father Stan successfully addressed at St. Mary's. After 14 years at St. Mary's, Rev. Stanley G. Gromadzki assumed duties as pastor at Sacred Heart Church in South Amboy on June 12, 2012. Most Rev. Paul G. Bootkoski, fourth Bishop of Metuchen, then appointed Rev. Michael J. Gromadzki Pastor of St. Mary's Church. Rev. Michael J. Gromadzki, so it happens, is the younger brother of Rev. Stanley G. Gromadzki and they are the first two brothers within the Diocese of Metuchen.

It is the oldest Episcopal parish in New Jersey and contains the oldest extant gravestone in New Jersey. History The congregation was organized in 1680 when 12 Church of England communicants designated themselves the Congregation of St. Peter's Episcopal Church. They erected a church using the foundation of an abandoned courthouse. That site is not far from the current church. In 1706, Anne, Queen of Great Britain presented the parish with a set of communion silver that is still extant. They received a royal charter in 1718 from George I of Great Britain. The second building on the site was built in 1722 and was destroyed by a fire. In 1770 Governor William Franklin was a vestryman in the congregation. During the American Revolution colonial soldiers built a redoubt behind the church to defend town against attacks from the British and Loyalist troops across the Arthur Kill in Staten Island.Leslie, Frank. Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, Volume 19, page 362 The current building was built in 1852. The first black man to vote in America, Thomas Mundy Peterson, was a member of the church and was buried in the church graveyard. He voted in the Perth Amboy, New Jersey mayoral election on March 31, 1870. That was one day after adoption of the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution.

After graduating from high school, he entered the Tohoku Gakuin University to study English literature and graduated from there in 1951. In 1952 he began his career as a poet in earnest by joining a circle that published the poetry magazine Hy≈çga (, lit. \\"glacier\\"). In the fifth issue of this magazine, he published his first poem called Urei wo Paipu ni Tsumete ().

Moving to Tokyo and Zero-on  In 1962, Niikuni would publish a magazine called Tama () with two other poets he met while contributing to Bungei T≈çhoku. The same year, in the fall he remarked that \\"people in Sendai just don't understand\\"Êñ∞ÂõΩË™†‰∏Ä worksÔºà2008Ôºâp.226 and decided to move to Tokyo.

On June 4, he established an association called the Association of Study of Arts or ASA ( Geijutsu Kenky≈´ Ky≈çkai) with Fujitomi with the objective of exploring and experimenting with concrete poetry. They published a namesake magazine ASA and in it introduced both Japanese and foreign concrete poetry, and also translated poems by Haroldo de Campos into Japanese. Fujitomi would also introduce the Brazilian concrete poetry group Noigandres' (es) member Luis Carlos Vinholes to Niikuni,Ëó§ÂØåÔºà2009Ôºâ„ÄÅp.35 and Vinholes in turn introduced the French poet Pierre Garnier (fr) to Niikuni. Niikuni would later send Zero-on to Garnier. In 1966, Niikuni and Garnier published a collective poetry work together called Nichifutsu Shish≈´ () in France. Furthermore, in 1969 he was asked to and displayed his works at the German Visual Poetry exhibition at the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen.Êñ∞ÂõΩË™†‰∏Ä worksÔºà2008Ôºâp.194 Requests from abroad to display his works kept increasing, and Niikuni gradually started to set his sights on foreign exhibitions.Âª∫Áï†„ÉªÂüéÊà∏„ÉªÈáëÊæ§Ôºà2009Ôºâp.16 In 1974, he held a one-man exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London.  Later years  From an early age, Niikuni had chest ailments and was constantly worried about his health. He was reportedly very happy to reach the age of 50, but would succumb to a sudden illness only two years later on August 23, 1977. He died in his home in Tokyo at the age of 52 (kazoedoshi). The publication of ASA also came to an end, with the seventh issue published in 1974 remaining as the last issue.  Works = Modernism in the beginning  Niikuni started to write poetry on the side while attending school, and until he was in his twenties he would write not experimental poetry but lyrical poetry. The effect of Sakutar≈ç Hagiwara could be seen in these works,Âª∫Áï†„ÉªÂüéÊà∏„ÉªÈáëÊæ§Ôºà2009Ôºâ„ÄÅp.11 and Niikuni also admitted himself that Hagiwara was his starting point.„Äå„É°„Çø„Éï„Ç°„Éº„ÅÆ„Åì„Å®„ÄçÔºà„ÄåÁÑ°Èôê„Äç29Âè∑„ÄÅ1972Âπ¥8ÊúàÔºâ Niikuni also wrote that he paid attention to the works of Shir≈ç Murano and Junzabur≈ç Nishiwaki.„ÄåNOTE„ÄçÔºà„Äé0Èü≥„Äè„Çà„ÇäÔºâ In addition, he was fascinated by surrealism, new objectivity and existentialism among others.  From metaphors to analogies  As Japan was faced the loss in the second World War, old values were uprooted and Niikuni started to question the meaning of words and metaphors in poems. In particular, he read Junzabur≈ç Nishiwaki's Ch≈ç-genjitsu-shugi-shiron () and found the idea of poems being metaphorical limiting and empty. Thereafter, he began to thoroughly strip words to their barest form,„ÄåASA„Äç7Âè∑„ÄÅ1974Âπ¥12Êúà1Êó• and to reappropriate words' meaning into poetry that was constructed out of shapes and sounds.Áèæ‰ª£Ë©©Ôºö„Åì„ÅÆ1Âπ¥ ÁõÆÁ´ã„Å£„Åü„ÄåÁîü„Å®Ê≠ª„Äç„ÅÆ‰∏ªÈ°å ÂüéÊà∏Êú±ÁêÜ„Åï„Çì„ÄÅÊùæÊµ¶ÂØøËºù„Åï„ÇìË™û„ÇãÔºà2009Âπ¥12Êúà24Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ßÔºâ However, he was not able to immediately move from the modernism of Nishiwaki and Hagiwara, but took a number of years of hesitation to be able to gradually move to visual and aural poetry.Âª∫Áï†„ÉªÂüéÊà∏„ÉªÈáëÊæ§Ôºà2009Ôºâp.12 With this transition, Niikuni did not completely reject metaphors, but included metaphor-like modernism and on top of it pursued poetry's essence in analogies.Âª∫Áï†„ÉªÂüéÊà∏„ÉªÈáëÊæ§Ôºà2009Ôºâp.13 Furthermore, as was already visible from his works at the time of Hy≈çga, Niikuni was particular about carnal expression such as using sexual kanji like (danjo, men and women) and (kuchibiru, lips).  Zero-on  St√©phane Mallarm√©'s Un coup de d√©s Niikuni would first present the concept of visual and aural poetry in 1963 in Zero-on ().Êñ∞ÂõΩË™†‰∏Ä worksÔºà2008Ôºâp.227 The work was divided into two parts, the first half consisting of calligraphic poetry and second half being aural poetry.Êñ∞ÂõΩË™†‰∏Ä worksÔºà2008Ôºâp.204 A note calling readers to read the poems aloud accompanied the first half. The calligraphic poetry in the first half was mainly constructed of kanji of varying sizes, hiragana and katakana characters, that were placed on pages with special emphasis on the spatiality that they created, being close to an experiment in visual poetry. The aural poetry in the second half was, as the name implies, poetry for listening,Âª∫Áï†„ÉªÂüéÊà∏„ÉªÈáëÊæ§Ôºà2009Ôºâp.19 exemplified by a public performance of reading aloud of the poems in December 1963. This experiment was witnessed by the composer Yasunao Tone among others.Êñ∞ÂõΩË™†‰∏Ä worksÔºà2008Ôºâp.191 The works in Zero-on, especially those of calligraphic poetry, that were created out of spatially emphasized characters, are thought to be the influenced by the French poet St√©phane Mallarm√©'s Un coup de d√©s. Influences by John Cage and twelve-tone music are also noted.„É§„É™„ÇøÔºà2009Ôºâp.51 Vinholes advocated the importance of audio to Niikuni,Âª∫Áï†„ÉªÂüéÊà∏„ÉªÈáëÊæ§Ôºà2009Ôºâp.18 after which Niikuni started to actively experiment with aural poetry. At the same time, reel to reel audio technology and phototypesetting were developed, and are seen to have had an effect on the style of expression in Zero-on and later works.Âª∫Áï†„ÉªÂüéÊà∏„ÉªÈáëÊæ§Ôºà2009Ôºâp.21  ASA and going international  Pierre Garnier's Pik bou Although at the time of Zero- on Niikuni was not yet aware of the international avant-garde poetry movement, he arrived at the same methodology as the concrete poetry movement in countries that used the alphabet.Êñ∞ÂõΩË™†‰∏Ä worksÔºà2008Ôºâp.229 When Pierre Garnier saw Zero-on, he was amazed at how similar works they strove for and produced although the languages they spoke differed so much.Êñ∞ÂõΩË™†‰∏Ä worksÔºà2008Ôºâp.192 This was the beginning of their friendship. Later, Garnier and Niikuni collaborated on Nichifutsu Shish≈´ (), producing works such as the Micropoem. Niikuni was noted abroad as an example of a writer that relied on ideographs (kanji), and requests to display his works kept coming in. Niikuni progressed to methods like graphic design and emphasizing communication after Zero-on,Êñ∞ÂõΩË™†‰∏Ä worksÔºà2008Ôºâp.231 but he would not budge from expressing through kanji characters. In ASA Niikuni presented his most notable works, such as Kawa mata wa Sh≈´ () and Ame (). He would place characters as if they were a surface, bringing forth the visuality of both the complete surface and individual characters at the same time.Êñ∞ÂõΩË™†‰∏Ä worksÔºà2008Ôºâp.208 In Yami (), the character for sound () would be seen breaking away from the character of darkness (). Niikuni also started using the Gothic typeface instead of Minch≈ç. It is thought that this kind of breaking kanji into its parts and varying the shape of characters was done with Western audiences in mind. Also from around this time, his works started incorporating explanatory notes in English about the meaning of the kanji characters used.

Built in 1890, it continues to house an active parish, and it has been recognized as a historic site because of its architecture. Parish history A window from the church depicts Saint Remy baptizing Clovis I. French-speaking Catholics began to settle in southwestern Shelby County and nearby northeastern Darke County in 1823; in their earliest years, these people were served by an itinerant priest, Father Navarron.Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: St. Remy Catholic Church. Ohio Historical Society, August 1977. In 1839, a parish was created for these settlers and dedicated to St. Valbert; its first building was located northeast of Versailles.Fortin, Roger. Faith and Action: A History of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati 1821-1996 . Columbus: Ohio State UP, 2002, 400. When the priests and nuns of the Society of the Precious Blood began to settle in western Ohio in the 1840s, St. Valbert's became a mother church for the Society.Brown, Mary Ann and Mary Niekamp. '. National Park Service, July 1978. Accessed 2010-03-03. The parish was split three ways in 1846: the members to the west of St. Valbert's became part of Holy Family parish, while the members to the southeast became part of St. Remy parish; the remaining members of St. Valbert's erected a new building in the village of Versailles in 1864, at which time it was rededicated to St. Denis. Russia's first settler built his house in the village in 1853; he was followed by many more settlers by the end of the decade. Many of these early settlers had migrated from the Russian Empire;Hitchcock, A.B.C. \\"History of Shelby County, Ohio and Representative Citizens\\". Chicago: Richmond-Arnold, 1913. upon seeing the site for the first time in the winter, they were struck by its resemblance to the Russian steppes and named the village for their former home. The members of St. Remy's constructed a church in the new village in 1854; built of logs, it was dedicated by Archbishop John Baptist Purcell on June 15, 1854. Growth soon necessitated its replacement; the resulting large brick church was built in 1869. As the parishioners continued to multiply, this structure too became insufficient for their numbers, and the third and present structure was erected in 1890. Architecture Interior St. Remy's Church is built primarily in the Romanesque Revival style of architecture, but its tower displays the Gothic Revival style. In the early 20th century, it was rated as one of the most beautiful churches in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati and one of its purest examples of Romanesque Revival architecture. The structure rests on a stone foundation with a basement. Sandblasted brick walls, which rise to multiple gables, are topped with a slate roof. The interior is lit by many stained glass windows along both sides. In 1954 and 1976, the church was extensively modified: a vestibule was added to the front, blocking the original facade, and the original altars and statues were destroyed or heavily changed. Architectural historians have classified the Precious Blood-related churches of western Ohio into four generations. The churches of the first generation, which were typically small log structures, have largely disappeared; only St. John's Church in Fryburg to the northeast has remained without significant changes. The churches of the second generation are generally small and simple brick structures, most of the churches of the third generation are large Gothic Revival buildings with extensive ornamentation, and the churches of the fourth generation exhibit a wide range of styles, including Italianate and Romanesque Revival. Although it is primarily a Romanesque Revival structure, St. Remy's falls within the period of the third generation, which includes churches built between 1885 and 1905. Recent history A 1977 architectural survey ranked the church's exterior in good condition and its interior as being endangered by modifications. In 1979, St. Remy's Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its architectural significance. Thirty-two other properties, including twenty-five other churches, were listed on the National Register at the same time as part of a multiple property submission of properties in western Ohio related to the Missionaries of the Precious Blood. Among these thirty-two other buildings were two other churches and three other related buildings in western Shelby County. The tall, Gothic Revival towers featured by many of these churches have caused this region of western Ohio to be nicknamed the \\"Land of the Cross-Tipped Churches.\\" Today, St. Remy is an active parish of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.

The codex contains a number of treatises on a variety of subjects, including mechanics and geometry. The name of the codex came from the Earl of Arundel, who acquired it in Spain in the 1630s. It forms part of the British Library Arundel Manuscripts.  Description  The manuscript contains 283 paper leaves of various size, most of them approximately 22 cm x 16 cm. Only a few of the leaves are blank. Two folios, 100 and 101, were incorrectly numbered twice. The codex is a collection of Leonardo's manuscripts originating from every period in his working life, a span of 40 years from 1478 to 1518.Carlo Pedretti, Introduction to Leonardo's Codex Arundel It contains short treatises, notes and drawings on a variety of subjects from mechanics to the flight of birds. From Leonardo's text, it appears that he gathered the pages together, with the intention of ordering and possibly publishing them. Leonardo customarily used a single folio sheet of paper for each subject, so that each folio presented as a small cohesive treatise on an aspect of the subject, spread across both back and front of a number of pages. This arrangement has been lost by later book binders who have cut the folios into pages and laid them on top of each other, thereby separating many subjects into several sections and resulting in an arrangement which appears random.Katrina Dean, Keeping books of nature: An introduction to Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs Codices Arundel and Leicester, British Library It is similar to the Codex Leicester, which is also a compilation of the notes, diagrams and sketches. The Codex Arundel is recognized as second in importance to the Codex Atlanticus.  History  The manuscript was written at the end of the 15th century and in the beginning of the 16th century in Italy. Most of the pages can be dated to between 1480 and 1518.Codex Arundel at the Leonardo the ideal city The manuscript was purchased in the early 17th century by Thomas Howard, 2nd Earl of Arundel (1585‚Äì1646), art collector and politician. His grandson, Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk (1628‚Äì1684), presented it to the newly- founded Royal Society in 1667. The manuscript was first catalogued in 1681 by William Perry, a librarian, as a scientific and mathematical notebook.Librorum Manuscriptorum Bibliotechae Norfociane in Collego Greshamensi ... accurate Guilielmo Perry, in Edward Bernard, Catalogi Manuscriptorum Angliae, 1697, vol. 2, 74-84, No 254.

The first performance took place on February 6, 1959 at Christ Church Cathedral with the choir performing Bach‚Äôs Mass in B Minor. Positive reviews from music critics and successful appearances on CBC Radio eventually inspired the chorus to become an auditioned semi-professional ensemble in the early 1970s when James Fankhauser began to lead the group, winning the Healey Willan Grand Prize in 1984 and a Juno Award nomination for Best Classical Album (Vocal or Choral Performance) in 1994. From 2002 to 2012 the choir was headed by conductor Eric Hannan, who led the group to win the Healey Willan Grand Prize both in 2008 and 2011. In 2013, long-time VCS member Paula Kremer became artistic director, and in 2019 she led the group to several awards in the National Competition for Canadian Amateur Choirs, again including Canada Council's Healey Willan Prize. Although the ensemble's name implies focus on music of the Baroque period, the Vancouver Cantata Singers also perform contemporary music, working frequently with local Canadian composers such as Jocelyn Morlock, Peter Hannan, Kristopher Fulton, Imant Raminsh, Stephen Chatman, Jordan Nobles, Craig Galbraith, and they also perform pieces arranged by members of the choir.

Professional wrestling career=Early life and career Scott was born in Hamilton, Ontario and growing up, he enjoyed football, wrestling at the YMCA and bodybuilding with Mike Sharpe. The Flying Scotts His older brother George helped Sandy break into the wrestling business in 1954. They began teaming in Stampede Wrestling, winning the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship in 1954. After a brief stint in Maple Leaf Gardens in 1955, The Flying Scotts, as they were known, became one of the top tag teams in the Toronto and Buffalo areas during the late 1950s. Defeating Chris and John Tolos for the Stampede International Tag Team Championship in 1958, they would feud with Butcher and Mad Dog Vachon the following year. The duo returned to the Carolinas during the 1960s before eventually regained the Stampede International Tag Team Championship in 1963. They also won the AWA World Tag Team Championship in Indiana and, while in Australia during the late 1960s, won the IWA World Tag Team Championship three times between 1966 and 1968. While in Stampede Wrestling in 1954, they became one of the most popular tag teams in Western Canada during their six-year stay in the promotion. At one event, in which they were featured in the main event against The Miller Brothers (Bill and Ed Miller), promoters were forced to turn away 6,000 at a Stampede Wrestling event before splitting up. The two would eventually have a falling out after the death of their mother, which resulted in Sandy refusing to attend her funeral.

Later, WANG-FM switched to adult standards. The station switched briefly to Westwood One oldies; on April 17, 2005, the call letters changed to WKOO (Kool 105.1\\"). On June 13, 2005, the station changed to the Westwood One \\"Sam FM\\" adult hits format and the WSSM call letters. In October 2006, WSSM returned to Dial-Global's Adult Standards format \\"America's Best Music\\". In late April 2008, the WSSM returned to the SAM \\"Simply About Music\\" adult hits format. On May 27, 2010, WSSM ceased operation as it changed formats when sold by NextMedia Group under new ownership and changed call letters to WLVG. Call sign history The station was assigned call sign WKVO-FM in 1971, and was sold to MusicRadio, Inc. (a Maryland group) who changed the calls to WMSQ in 1978. The station was a very valuable asset to the town of Havelock, N.C. and the nearby Marine Air Station at Cherry Point during several hurricanes in the 1980s. Havelock's business \\"golden age\\" peaked during the station's successful years from 1979 to 1990, partly due to the community involvement of station management and personalities. Arbitron ratings consistently saw the small station competing with much more powerful FM stations in nearby New Bern and Washington, N.C. On August 15, 1996, the station changed its call sign to WANG; on January 22, 1999 to WANG-FM; on April 11, 2005 to WKOO; on June 21, 2005 to WSSM; on March 10, 2008 to WRQR, then back to WSSM. On May 27, 2010, the calls were changed to WLVG. On April 16, 2018, the station changed its call sign to WHAR.

She was last seen alive hiking with her dog on Blood Mountain in northern Georgia on New Year's Day 2008. Witnesses claimed to have seen her with an older man on the Spur Trail connecting the Appalachian Trail with the Byron Herbert Reece Parking Lot. When she did not return home on January 2, 2008, her friends began to search for her, without success. Her dog, Ella, was found on January 4, 2008, in Cumming, Georgia, approximately away. At the time of her disappearance, Emerson lived in Buford, Georgia. Biography Emerson was born in Charleston, South Carolina. She was raised in Holly Springs, North Carolina, a suburb of Raleigh, and in Longmont, Colorado. Emerson graduated from Niwot High School. In 2005, she graduated with honors from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor's degree in French and was given the Cecil Willcox Award for Excellence in French. Investigation On January 4, 2008, three days after Emerson was last seen, a witness at a Chevron gas station called DeKalb police and stated that \\"the guy you are looking for is cleaning out his van.\\" The police quickly arrived on scene and were able to stop the accused before he could bleach the interior of the van. Crime scene analysts obtained blood evidence that was matched to Emerson's DNA. Gary Michael Hilton was subsequently arrested and charged with Emerson's murder. The prosecution agreed to take the death penalty off the table if Hilton would lead investigators to her body. Hilton agreed and successfully led investigators to Emerson's body. Hilton claimed he had asked Emerson for her debit card PIN and that when she failed to give him the correct number, he kept her for four days before killing her. Hilton stated he could not bring himself to kill her dog and that when it came to the woman herself, \\"It was hard ... you gotta remember we had spent several good days together.\\" Conviction On January 30, 2008, Gary Hilton pleaded guilty to the murder of Emerson. He was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility for parole in 30 years. Hilton was later linked to and then charged with three additional murders: the October 2007 murders of elderly couple John and Irene Bryant in North Carolina, and the December 2007 murder of 46-year-old nurse Cheryl Dunlap in Florida. It has been speculated that Hilton might also be responsible for the 1997 murder of Judy Smith. This is because Hilton had left one of his victims in a similar condition near where Smith's body was discovered. In 2011, Hilton was tried for Dunlap's murder and was sentenced to death. In 2012, Hilton pleaded guilty to the kidnapping and murder of the Bryants, for which he was sentenced to life in prison. Cause of death Autopsy results for Emerson indicated she was killed on January 4, 2008, from blunt force trauma to the head. Crime scene photo controversy On February 25, 2010, Hustler magazine reporter Fred Rosen asked for the Meredith Emerson crime scene and autopsy photos as part of an open records request filed with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI). The victim's family requested that the request must be denied according to attorney Lindsay Haigh. In March of 2010, DeKalb Superior Court Judge Daniel Coursey issued a temporary order restraining the GBI from releasing \\"any and all photographs, visual images or depictions of Meredith Emerson which show Emerson in an unclothed or dismembered state.\\" This order came on the same date that the Georgia House Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously passed \\"The Meredith Emerson Memorial Privacy Act\\", which prevents crime scene photos from being publicly released or disseminated, according to Rep. Jill Chambers. House Bill 1322 stops the dissemination of images of victims who in the photos appear \\"nude, bruised, bloodied or in a broken state with open wounds, a state of dismemberment or decapitation.\\" \\"We have to walk the line between open record laws and the constitutional provisions that allow women to be able to be photographed nude or in pornography when they knowingly and willingly offer their bodies for dissemination,\\" Chambers stated. \\"Meredith isn't in a position to give that kind of permission to have her exploited in that kind of venue...we're not only protecting future victims of crime, we're protecting the integrity of what happened to Meredith.\\" Hustler's response was through an email that said, \\"Hustler is aware of the GBI's refusal to honor its reporter's request for copies of the Emerson crime scenes photos, which were to be used in a news story about this crime. Hustler and Mr. Flynt disagree with the GBI's position, and are currently exploring all legal options available to them should the decision be made to go forward with the story.\\" References Category:1983 births Category:2008 deaths Category:2008 in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:2008 murders in the United States Category:January 2008 events in the United States Category:People murdered in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:University of Georgia alumni Category:American murder victims Category:Deaths by beating in the United States Category:Female murder victims Category:People from Charleston, South Carolina Category:People from Buford, Georgia Category:People from Gwinnett County, Georgia Category:Dawson County, Georgia ","title":"Murder of Meredith Emerson"},{"id":"26521347","title":"Intrauterine device"},{"id":"26521368","text":"The Battle of D√ºrenstein order of battle included a Coalition force of Russian and Austrian troops, under the overall command of Mikhail Kutuzov, and a single division of the Corps Mortier commanded by √âdouard Mortier. In pursuing the Austrian retreat from Bavaria, Mortier had over-extended the three divisions of his newly formed VIII. Corps, spreading them along the north bank of the Danube. Kutuzov enticed Mortier to send Th√©odore Maxime Gazan's 2nd Division into a trap; French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns, and were only rescued by the timely arrival of the 1st Division, under command of Pierre Dupont de l'√âtang. The battle extended well into the night. Both sides claimed a victory. The French lost more than a third of the Corps, and Gazan's division experienced over 40 percent losses. The Austrians and Russians also had heavy losses‚Äîclose to 16 percent‚Äîbut arguably the most significant was the death in action of Johann Heinrich von Schmitt, one of Austria's most capable chiefs of staff. Battle Much of the battle was fought after dark. Early in the morning on 11 November, three coalition columns departed from the vicinity of Krems an der Donau and Melk, circled around the promontory on which D√ºrnstein is located, to prepare to attack the French column that had encamped overnight at the village. In the morning, responding to rumors of a Russian rear guard, attacked the Russian encampment at nearby Stein; the two forces engaged head-on until afternoon when one of the Russian columns finally made its way through the mountain defiles and attacked the French rear. The French were trapped in the Danube canyon, attacked from the front and the rear by the Russians. A second French division, under command of Dupont, arrived and attacked the Russian column. Following this attack, another Coalition column arrived and attacked the French. The battle extended well into the night before both sides stopped. Rainer. Egger.

The French lost more than a third of the VIII. Corps, and Gazan's division experienced over 40 percent losses. Mortier had failed to protect his northern flank, despite specific instructions from Napoleon.

Kawada and Fuyuki, who by then went under the name Ricky Fuyuki, went under the team name Japanese Force and they feuded with American Force (Paul Diamond and Shawn Michaels). They were managed by Gary Hart. In 1987, Kawada and Fuyuki, now going by the name Samson Fuyuki, joined Genichiro Tenryu's Revolution. In January 1988, they began wearing matching ring attire and named their team Footloose. On March 9, 1988, Footloose won the All Asia Tag Team Championship, defeating Mighty Inoue and Takashi Ishikawa. They would hold the titles for exactly six months before losing the belts to Shinichi Nakano and Shunji Takano on September 9, 1988. However, Footloose rebounded by defeating Nakano and Takano to reclaim the titles six days later, on September 15, 1988. After the feud with Nakano and Takano died down, Footloose went into a heated rivalry with The Can-Am Express (Doug Furnas and Dan Kroffat). On June 5, 1989, Furnas and Kroffat defeated them for the All Asia Tag Team titles. Four months later, on October 20, 1989, Footloose defeated the Express to win back the titles for the third time. Their third reign would be their last, before losing the titles back to the Express on March 2, 1990. Soon after the title loss in April 1990, Footloose disbanded, as Kawada would form a team with friend Tiger Mask II, who would later unmask, revealing himself as Mitsuharu Misawa.

Angelou and Leonora Thuna wrote the screenplay, and the movie was directed by Fielder Cook. Constance Good played the young Maya Angelou. Also appearing were Esther Rolle, Roger E. Mosley, Diahann Carroll, Ruby Dee, and Madge Sinclair. Filming took place in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The movie traces Maya's life from when she and her brother move in with their grandmother to the trauma of being raped as a young girl by one of her mother's boyfriends and the several years of silence that came after the attack. Two scenes in the movie differed from events described in the book. Angelou added a scene between Maya and Uncle Willie after the Joe Louis fight. In it, he expresses his feelings of redemption after Louis defeats a white opponent. Angelou also presents her eighth-grade graduation differently in the film. In the book, Henry Reed delivers the valedictory speech and leads the black audience in the Negro national anthem. In the movie, Maya conducts these activities.

History P√≠o Pico was given a provisional grant of one square league Governor Victoria in 1831. His brother, Andr√©s Pico, ran the rancho from 1836 to 1838. In 1837 the rancho was attacked by Indians, and the rancho abandoned. In 1851, Pico's brother-in-law, John Forster, claiming to be acting as Pico's agent, sold Rancho Jamul to Bonifacio Lopez, Philip Crosthwaite (Lopez son-in-law), Richard Rust, and William E. Rust. However, it does not appear that anything was ever done in performance of the contract by anyone. But this was the cause latter of extensive litigation concerning ownership of Rancho Jamul. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for two square leagues by P√≠o Pico for Rancho Jamul was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, but was rejected in 1855 on the grounds of insufficient documentation of the grant.

He was professionally known as Fabian. Bachrach was best known for a portrait of Senator John F. Kennedy, which was later used as his official photograph after he was elected President in 1960. Bachrach's family, who own Bachrach Studios, has been in the commercial photography business for more than 140 years. Bachrach Studios is believed to be the world's oldest continuously operating photography studio. His paternal grandfather, David Bachrach founded Bachrach Studios in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1868. He had previously photographed Abraham Lincoln during his trip to Gettysburg in 1863 during the U.S. Civil War. Biography Louis Fabian Bachrach Jr. was born in Newton, Massachusetts, on April 9, 1917. His father, Louis Fabian Bachrach, was also a photographer. Bachrach received a bachelor's degree in history from Harvard University in 1939 and joined Bachrach Studios shortly afterwards. Bachrach served as an aerial navigator in the United States Navy in the Pacific during World War II. Bachrach later earned a master's degree in Italian literature from Boston College in 1988, when he was in his 70s. Bachrach introduced color photography to Bachrach Studios during the 1950s, and switched the studios completely to color images during the 1970s. Some of Bachrach's most famous subjects included presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, Jean-Claude Duvalier, Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Indira Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Jacques Cousteau, Joe DiMaggio, Richard Avedon, Robert Frost, Buckminster Fuller, Ted Kennedy, and Muhammad Ali.

The choir currently consists of 18 boy choristers and 12 lay clerks and sings eight services weekly in the Cathedral. Additionally, 20 girl choristers sing one service a week as well as concerts. Sometimes the group augments their numbers when certain musical works require a greater number of voices. The group's choristers (only boys) all attend The Pilgrims' School where they study singing, music theory, music history, and at least one instrument in addition to general academic studies. The choir regularly tours internationally, has produced numerous recordings, and appears often in television and radio broadcasts. The choir is currently directed by Andrew Lumsden, who assumed the post in 2002.Winchester Cathedral Choir at concertorganists.com The exact year in which the chorus was founded is unknown, but it is likely that the choir was formed in the 14th century. The earliest historical document relating to the chorus dates from 1402 when a John Dyer was named as the cathedral's organist and chorus-master. A 1544 statute by Henry VIII of England decreed that the cathedral should have ten boys in the choir and a single organist. There are also 20 girl choristers, who all attend local schools and sing at least one service a week during term-time. They sing with the boy choristers for most major concerts, at Easter and Christmas, and for the Southern Cathedrals Festival every summer (when they also sing with the girl choristers of Salisbury Cathedral). The girls have toured Europe on several occasions, and record CDs, both with the boy choristers and on their own. They have also appeared in many television and radio broadcasts, including singing live on BBC1 on Easter morning, and on Christmas Day. The Girls' Choir was founded in 1999 by Sarah Baldock, and is now under the joint leadership of the Director of Music, Andrew Lumsden, and the Assistant Director of Music, George Castle.

The house serves as a house museum, and according to its nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, described \\"as being the finest example of Greek Revival architecture in the Midwest.\\" Original home The property where the house was built was part of a five acre tract purchased by Odile Delor Lux, a granddaughter of Clement Delor de Treget, the founder of Carondelet, Missouri. The property originally was part of the St. Louis common fields. In 1848, Lux married Henry Chatillon, who had become somewhat famous as the leader of the expedition of Francis Parkman in The Oregon Trail. By 1849, a house stood on the property owned by Chatillons. The early house was a simple, two-story brick farmhouse with four rooms and a one-slope roof. Regardless of Chatillon's renown, parcels of the tract were sold in 1850, and the remainder of the property (including the farmhouse) was sold in 1855. The purchaser was Nicolas DeMenil, a French physician who in October 1836 married Emilie Sophie Chouteau, the descendant of both of the founders of St. Louis. DeMenil and his wife initially purchased the house in 1856 with another family. By the beginning of the Civil War they decided to reside in it year-round, and bought out the interest of the other family. The DeMenils hired Henry Pitcher, a carpenter and contractor, to remodel and expand it in the Greek Revival Style. The house is surrounded by numerous historic buildings, including the former Lemp and still-operating Anheuser- Busch Breweries; there are other nearby buildings of historic interest, The Lemp Mansion at 3322 Demenil Pl. is located just to the north of the house. It is also located in the Cherokee Antique Row. Renovations and expansion The house's western side was expanded . This addition consisted of three stories, two porches, and possibly the carriage house. Renovations were complete by 1863. However, due to development in the surrounding area (partly financed by DeMenil himself), the view of the river was obstructed from the house, and the front entrance was moved to face 13th Street; balustrades and a porch were added to improve the appearance of the new entrance in 1879. Nicolas DeMenil died shortly after completing the new entrance; his son, Alexander DeMenil, inherited the home and lived in it until his death in 1928. A third generation of DeMenils moved into the home only to find the once bucolic surrounding of the house had become a bustling urban neighborhood, and moved in 1940. Paleontology, decline and renovation In 1940, local pharmaceutical manufacturer Lee Hess converted the home into apartments, reserving one for himself and his wife. Hess had purchased the property in part for the extensive system of caves under the property, which he opened as a tourist attraction. Newly christened by Hess as \\"Cherokee Cave\\" the caves were open to visitors until the demolition of its entrance underneath present-day Interstate 55. Due to the discovery of the remains of a peccary of the genus Platygonus, the noted paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson proceeded to move into the home, using it as a staging area for investigating the remains of prehistoric animals in the caves. The cave system had once served as the lagering cellars for the nearby Lemp Brewery in the Nineteenth Century. By the 1950s, the home was becoming derelict, and plans for Interstate 55 called for the demolition of the home. However, a route change in 1961 permitted the home to be saved by the Landmarks Association of St. Louis. The Union Electric Company contributed to the purchase of the home and sponsored its renovation in concert with the Landmarks Association, and the Missouri Department of Transportation agreed to the plan. In summer 1964, renovations began under the authority of architect Gerhardt Kramer, and the home was dedicated the next year. The Landmarks Association created the Chatillon‚ÄìDeMenil House Foundation as owner of the house, and it continues to operate the home as a museum.

Aarhus municipal council and Aarhus county chose to use the letter √Ö instead of Aa, but it was optional for counties or municipalities or cities/towns whether they would keep or change the original spelling from before 1948. From January 2011, four (4) years after the counties were abolished, the politicians in the municipality chose to return to the original spelling Aa instead of √Ö.

This merger was not a part of the structural reform that merged most of Denmark's municipalities and other entities in the public sector a few years later.

After death, a person's ghost would normally travel to the sky world or the underworld, but some could stay on earth. In many Polynesian legends, ghosts were often involved in the affairs of the living. Ghosts might also cause sickness or even invade the body of ordinary people, to be driven out through strong medicines. Ghost spirit In the reconstructed Proto- Polynesian language, the word \\"*qaitu\\"*q in reconstructed Proto-Polynesian words indicates a glottal stop. refers to a ghost, the spirit of a dead person, while the word \\"*tupuqa\\" has a broader meaning including all supernatural beings. Some of the ancient MƒÅui legends that are common throughout the Polynesian islands include the idea of a double soul inhabiting the body. One was the soul which never forsakes man, and the other the soul that could be separated or charmed away from the body by incantations was the \\"hau\\". In some societies, the tattoo marks on the Polynesian's face indicated their cult. A spiral symbol meant that the man favoured the sky world, but before ascending there on a whirlwind his ghost had to travel to his people's homeland, situated in the navel of the world. Different markings indicated that the ghost chose to live in the underworld. The Hawaiians believed in \\"aumakua\\", ghosts who did not go down into Po, the land of King Milu. These ghosts remained in the land of the living, guarding their former families. In Polynesian culture, it is believed that humans can not see the souls that have already crossed over into the other world, though it was believed that some extraordinary individuals with certain abilities could see them. However, the souls that do not cross over are left in the real world with their original appearance. Humans are able to see these roaming spirits mostly at night and sometimes during the day.

These spirits would wonder because they did not have proper ceremonies or that demons had harmed them and thrown them off their path in order to cross over to the other world. Over time, these wandering spirits would eventually become evil demons and would usually wander around significant locations such as a birth place or where they had died and wait for their chance to harm an innocent living soul.Buckov√°, Martina. \\"A COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS OF ESCHATOLOGICAL THEMES IN POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY AS A SURVIVOR OF PROTO- POLYNESIAN UNITY.\\" Asian & African Studies (13351257) 20.1 (2011). https://www.sav.sk/journals/uploads/091911126_Buckov%c3%a1.pdf These certain spirits can also be/ are exercised by name. The underworld was considered to be the place where the souls of common people went.

Legends All Polynesian societies have many stories of ghosts or spirits who played a role in their traditional legends. William Drake Westervelt collected and published eighteen of them in Hawaiian Legends of Ghosts and Ghost-Gods (1915). The legend of Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanic fire, relates how she fell in love with a man, but found that he had died. She found his ghost as a thin presence in a cave, and with great difficulty used her magical powers to restore him to life. He was destroyed again, but his ghost was once more found, this time in the form of a bird flitting over the waters, and once more restored to life. Tinirau, the fish god or \\"innumerable\\" was the sea God with two faces known all through-out Polynesia. He has been depicted in painting as well as stone carvings from Samoa to Hawaii and has many back stories depending on where you are and who you ask. The Mangaia people of the Cook Islands portray him has half man and half fish. Other cultures define him as a chief or the son of a chief. He is said to have promised endless amounts of fish to the islands and many Hawaiians still pray to him for good fortune while fishing. Pele the goddess of lava and volcanos has long been a part of the Hawaiian culture and is believed to be able to bring misfortune to natives and visitors alike. Pele is considered the creator of the islands and the embodiment of anger and jealousy. Native Hawaiians know her by her more traditional name Halemaumau, which translates to \\"the fiery pit creator\\". Over time the legend has changed however. Originally it was believed that if the rocks or ground was disturbed on the volcano that Pele would cause an eruption as a sign of being displeased. In more recent years it is widely believed that if tourists take pieces of the rock or black sand off the islands with them that Pele will curse them and cause great misfortune in their lives until it is returned to where it came from. This belief causes hundreds of people a year to ship packages containing the stones they picked up while vacations and blaming the goddess for bad things that happened to them since they returned home. Another Hawaiian legend tells of a young man who fell into the hands of the priests of a high temple who captured and sacrificed him to their god, and then planned to treat his bones dishonorably. The young man's ghost revealed the situation to his father through a dream, and aided his father to retrieve the bones through great exertions and to place them in his own secret burial cave. The ghost of the young man was then able to joyfully go down to the spirit world. Influence of ghosts Ghost sickness in Polynesia takes two forms: possession and bizarre behavior, where the victim often talks with the voice of a dead person, and retarded healing caused by a ghost or evil spirit. The patient is treated with strong-smelling plants such as beach pea, island rue or ti plant (Cordyline fruticosa), and in the case of possession through reasoning with the ghost. This illness can be caused by sorcery and cured by mystical means seems to have been a common Polynesian belief. The Samoans thought that the souls of the dead could return to the land of the living by night and cause disease and death by entering the bodies of either their friends or their enemies. To cure illness, the Samoan relied not on medicine but exorcism. Lewis, Robert E. \\"The Soul and the Afterworld in hawaiian Myth and in Other Polynesian Cultures.\\" (1980). https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/21180/Lewis_1980.pdf The Polynesian people usually did not fear these spirits, unless they were deceased enemies of the individual or members of a tribe that had done them harm.Buckov√°, Martina. \\"A COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS OF ESCHATOLOGICAL THEMES IN POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY AS A SURVIVOR OF PROTO-POLYNESIAN UNITY.\\" Asian & African Studies (13351257) 20.1 (2011). https://www.sav.sk/journals/uploads/091911126_Buckov%c3%a1.pdf  In the arts  Of his 1892 Tahitian painting Manao Tupapau, Paul Gauguin said \\"according to Tahitian beliefs, the title Manao Tupapau has a double meaning . . . either she thinks of the ghost or the ghost thinks of her\\". Robert Louis Stevenson wrote about Polynesian beliefs and customs, including the belief in ghosts, in his last collection of stories, Island Nights' Entertainments. He wrote the book on Samoa in 1893 in a realistic style that was not well received by the critics, but the stories which dealt with false and real supernatural events are now considered among his best .

He designed and built the aircraft that was flown by Ernest Failloubaz for the first flight in Switzerland of an aircraft built and flown by Swiss citizen, was probably the first glacier pilot and was pioneering on seaplanes. Ren√© Grandjean in 1910 Emile Tadd√©oli and Ren√© Grandjean at a flight meeting in Zug, August 1912  Life  Grandjean was born in Bellerive, Switzerland. In 1890 the family moved to Paris where Ren√© did his first studies before returning to Bellerive where his father built a mill and a big saw-mill supported by the young Ren√© who was fascinated by the technics. At the age of 18 he moved again to Paris to find a job as a mechanics. Two months later, he was the driver for the marquis de Montebello and later in Egypt for the sultan Omar Bey who became his friend.  Beginning of the Swiss Aviation  In summer 1909, Grandjean started to realize his longtime dream to build a flying machine; the news of Bl√©riot‚Äôs flight across the channel convinced him to leave Egypt and to return to Switzerland. There he met Ernest Failloubaz, 17 years old, and thanks to his inventiveness and craftsman qualities, using only a picture of Bl√©riot‚Äôs aircraft, he completed this first aircraft in October 1909. The ground tests started in February 1910 at l‚ÄôEstivage field in Avenches. What is recognized as of today as being the starting point of the Swiss aviation, happened on 10 May 1910: Failloubaz piloted the machine, resulting in the first flight in Switzerland of an aircraft built and flown by Swiss citizen. Ren√© Grandjean succeeded five days after his friend‚Äôs first flight but crashed the plane. Immediately repaired, his aircraft was in August 1910 damaged again by Georges Cailler during a flight meeting in Viry, Haute- Savoie. Ernest Failloubaz and Ren√© Grandjean at the first Swiss flight meeting in Avenches On October 2, Failloubaz and Grandjean participated at the first Swiss flight meeting in Avenches, from October 8 to 10 in Bern. On 12 October 1910, Grandjean was prohibited from using l‚ÄôEstivage airfield; the end of the collaboration between Failloubaz and Grandjean who moved to D√ºbendorf. In November he made major transformations on his aircraft and during that winter he learned to fly, by himself. In early 1911, Grandjean was hired by Oerlikon Contraves to promote their new engine by the manufacturer Farman, Bl√©riot and Voisin. On 18 June 1911, Ren√© Grandjean succeeded in crossing the Lake Neuch√¢tel, on September 18 he obtained the Swiss pilot's licence number 21 and won the Prix d'aviation de l'Automobile-Club de Suisse on 4 December 1911. In December 1911 Grandjean was invited at Davos to fly above the resort; he pioneered in building ski to skid on the snow without sinking into it. On 2 February 1912, he carried out the first take off and landing on ski in Switzerland, followed by more than hundred flights within few days without any incident. He was probably the first glacier pilot in the world. In summer 1912, Grandjean replaced the skis by floats designed and engineered by himself, resulting in the first takeoff of a Swiss hydroplane (seaplane) on 4 August 1912. At the controls of this seaplane he won several prizes, including the Eynard prize for the invention of a magneto allowing to start the engine from the pilot's seat. Grandjean was one of 12 Swiss pilots called up with their aircraft in late summer 1914 to form the latter Swiss Air Force. Nevertheless, he presented further inventions that did not find support in Switzerland. Grandjean decided to leave for Paris in 1915 where he rapidly became a very demanded technical counsellor, got patents for more than two hundred of his own inventions and returned definitely to Switzerland in 1956. He died in Lausanne.  Honor  On 31 May 1956, Grandjean was invited to inaugurate his own monument in Portalban on Lake Neuch√¢tel where he landed after his crossing in September 1911. Then he participated with almost all surviving Swiss aviation pioneers to the 50th anniversary of Swiss aviation in November 1960 in Avenches. On 10 May 1965, a monument was erected in Avenches in memory of Ernest Failloubaz, complemented by a commemorative plate reminding his collaboration with Grandjean as the birth of aviation in Switzerland.

Through the Years, Brightly: Tadtarin , pia.gov.ph is a short story written by Filipino National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin. In addition to being regarded as one of Joaquin's most acclaimed literary works, the tale is considered to be controversial. The story narrates a ritual performed by women to invoke the gods to grant the blessing of fertility by dancing around a Balete tree that was already a century old. Joaquin later turned this short story into a play entitled Tatarin: A Witches' Sabbath in Three Acts, on which a film adaptation has been based. Overview Tatarin, also sometimes spelled Tadtarin, was a three-day traditional fertility ritual involving women and held during summer in the Philippines. The last day of the festival coincided with St. John's Day; a Catholic feast. Men dressed as women were able to participate in the pagan celebration. It is similar to the fertility rites of Obando, Bulacan. Apart from being considered as Joaquin's personal favorite, The Summer Solstice was also one of the most anthologized. Although popular, it was also regarded controversial due to conflicting interpretations about the masterpiece. Filipino literary critics had debated over the ending of the story, questioning what was victorious in the narrative. The items in conflict were paganism against Christianity, the primitive against the civilized, and the status of men against the status of women. The narrative of The Summer Solstice begins with St. John's Day, as it occurred in the 1850s in the Philippines. Entoy informed Do√±a Lupeng that Amada had participated in the Tatarin fertility ritual. Amada was believed to have become the Tatarin personified. The next day, while on board a carriage, Do√±a Lupeng started a conversation regarding how Amada could still believe in such a ritual. Don Paeng cut her short because children were listening. The carriage stopped, and they watched the St. John's Day procession. Thinking and speaking to herself, Do√±a Lupeng mocked the men's demonstration of arrogance during the procession. Upon arriving at the house, Do√±a Lupeng found out that Guido, Don Paeng's cousin, had participated in both the St. John's Day procession and the Tatarin ritual. Guido enjoyed the \\"fiestas\\". Guido kissed Do√±a Lupeng's feet as the latter was on her way to look for her children. Do√±a Lupeng told Don Paeng about the incident. Don Paeng was disgusted and reasoned that a woman needed love and respect, not adoration. Do√±a Lupeng and Don Paeng went to see the Tatarin ritual at the plaza. The revelers had their own St. John statue. Do√±a Lupeng joined the ceremony. Failing from pulling Do√±a Lupeng out of the ritual, Don Paeng had to ask the carriage driver, Entoy, to take Do√±a Lupeng back. At the house, Do√±a Lupeng was able to make Don Paeng tell her that he adored her. In submission, Don Paeng kissed Do√±a Lupeng's feet. Linguistic analysis An analysis related to the language used in this piece of literature revealed that the speech or dialogue of the characters represented \\"stereotypical notions of masculinity and femininity\\", the difference between genders, and the hierarchy that bound the two sexes. In spite of the part where the character Don Paeng was presented as a crawling man who kissed the feet of Do√±a Lupeng, female critics viewed the story as against women and anti-feminist. On the other hand, male critics saw the short story as pro- woman and feminist. Critics considered The Summer Solstice as pro-woman or a tale of \\"triumphant women\\" because of Don Paeng's submission to Do√±a Lupeng and the portrayal of women's reproductive role that made them \\"rulers of men\\". However, there were also critics who called The Summer Solstice as \\"pseudo- feminist\\" or a work that was not truly feminist because to them the authority and power given to women in the story was unreal, short-lived, of no social value, mysterious, and illusory. Based on the story, the empowerment of women emerged only once a year, in summer, and only during the Summer solstice. The role of women in the story was further described as \\"demonized\\" and \\"sexualized\\". Literary reviews Other items that literary critics focused on in The Summer Solstice included Joaquin's literary style and theme. In general, critics agree that Joaquin's stylistic genre was to present the way of life and culture in the Philippines during the transition from being Hispanic into American. Some critics praised Joaquin for his style of \\"setting the mood\\" for a presentation of a past full of mysticism, but others found Joaquin's melodrama as excessive thus pushing away from the story's \\"narrative logic and formal elements\\". The presentation of pagan rituals and Christian rites, superstitious and religious beliefs, the old and the new were argued to be more of a \\"fission\\" rather than a \\"fusion\\" due to the existence of the struggles occurring between the pairs mentioned. Contradicting descriptions of the Philippines during its pre-colonial past also led literary reviewers to regard Joaquin as a writer who was unable to \\"embrace\\" the ambience of such a time in Philippine history because he was more \\"nostalgic\\" of the colonial history of the country. Thus, Joaquin through The Summer Solstice and his other stories, was summarized as a search for his country's \\"national and cultural identity.\\"Salonga, Aileen O.

Kaplan, Mel Scult, Communings of the Spirit: The Journals of Modecai M. Kaplan, 1913‚Äì1934, 64. and the Doctor of Divinity degree (honoris causa), in 1966. For many years, he lived at JTS, serving as an informal and unofficial in-house counselor and mentor for generations of rabbinical students. In addition to his experience as a pulpit rabbi in New York synagogues including Congregation Shaare Zedek (New York City) on Manhattan's upper-West side, he was a chaplain for a number of New York institutions, including The Tombs, the Manhattan Detention Complex, and oversaw courses for prospective converts to Judaism in New York City.David Max Eichhorn, Conversions to Judaism by Reform and Conservative Rabbis, Jewish Social Studies, Indiana University Press, Vol. 16, No. 4 (Oct., 1954), pp. 299‚Äì318.

He graduated in 1920, in the same class as Max Kadushin, and one year before future JTS Chancellor, Louis Finkelstein. Early in his rabbinic career, he served in a number of synagogue pulpits, including Temple Sons of Israel, in White Plains, New York, 1920‚Äì21; Temple Beth Elohim, 1921‚Äì25; Temple Adath Israel, The Bronx, NY, 1925‚Äì30; and Temple Bnai Israel- Sheerith Judah, in upper Manhattan, 1933‚Äì1955.,Trenton Evening News, Jan 19, 1940The Heights Observer, February 1938.Bronx Jewish Herald, Dec 28, 1928, \\"Bronx Rabbi Takes a Fling at the \\"Lekovod Christmas\\" Jews. before leaving to focus on other endeavors, including teaching, writing, and chaplaincy service in New York prisons, hospitals, and senior citizen facilities. Alstat was an ardent Zionist and an early representative of the World Zionist Organization (WZO). In 1935, he spoke to a combined meeting of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) and Hadassah, declaring that \\"the solution of the problem of world Jewry lies in the rebuilding of the national Jewish homeland in Palestine.\\" He stated that > World Jewry is now wrestling with a complexity of major problems, such as > the combating of anti-Semitism which is rearing its ugly head in various > lands; finding a refuge for the persecuted and exiled Jews of Germany; > widening the ever-narrowing channels of economic opportunities for Jews; and > preserving and transmitting the spiritual heritage of the Jewish people. All > of these problems can be solved in large measure by accelerating the tempo > of the rebuilding of the Jewish national homeland in Palestine.Poughkeepsie > Daily Eagle, Feb 19, 1935. In addition to his positions with the WZO and ZOA, he was on the Executive Boards of many other organizations, including the United Synagogue of America, the Jewish National Fund, and the United Palestine Appeal, and an active member of others, including the Rabbinical Assembly, and the New York Board of Rabbis. He worked as a prison chaplain at the Manhattan Correctional Facility (\\"The Tombs\\") for three decades,New York Times, Obit, Nov 30, 1976. and served as secretary of the National Council of Jewish Prison Chaplains, sharing information with rabbis who worked with inmates and prison staff in other facilities throughout the United States.American Jewish Committee Archives, Directories and Lists. He explained his vision of prison chaplaincy by saying that, \\"My goals are the same as those of the prison authorities‚Äîto make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron bars. Mine are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart.\\"Edward Fiske, New York Times, City Prison Chaplains' Load is Heavy, Oct 26, 1970. He would sometimes take rabbinical students with him on his visits, schooling them on counseling techniques he had developed over the years. When he retired from prison chaplaincy work in 1974, as the city was preparing to tear down part of the facility (although it was eventually replaced by new buildings), he reflected over his career, noting that prison conditions had markedly improved, especially since the 1970 \\"upheavals\\" at The Tombs. He said there was \\"much more cordiality and serenity ‚Äì if it's possible to have any serenity in a prison.\\"Inmates and Guards Lament the Imminent End of the Tombs, New York Times, Dec 3, 1974. In addition to his work as a prison chaplain, Alstat also served as a chaplain for Jewish Memorial Hospital, Sydenham Hospital, and the Williams Memorial Residence, operated by the Salvation Army. His syndicated column, \\"Strange to Relate,\\" was printed in many Jewish papers, and led to many invitations to speak at Jewish community events. He was described as a \\"prominent American lecturer on Jewish oddities, curiosities, and fantasies.\\"Canadian Jewish News, March 7, 1947. However, while his column and some of his presentations focused on oddities‚Äîissues that were \\"strange to relate\\" ‚Äì Alstat was also well known for speaking his mind on the most serious of issues, delivering important messages in eloquent ways. In an American Jewish History article on the Rabbinical Assembly (RA), the author noted that during Alstat's early time in the rabbinate, the RA's concerns were about America and the Conservative movement, but it was rare to deal with the problems \\"plaguing the American rabbi.\\" Rabbi Alstat's address to the 1929 annual RA convention was especially noteworthy because he shared such concerns in a public forum, when he delivered the presentation, Observations on the Status of the Rabbinate.Pamela S. Nadell, Letter to the Editor, Commentary, September 1985.Abraham J. Karp, The Conservative Rabbi ‚Äì \\"Dissatisfied But Not Unhappy\\", originally published in American Jewish Archives, November 1983; reprinted in Jeffrey S. Gurock, American Jewish History, a 13-volume set sponsored by the American Jewish Historical Society, 1998, Vol 5, Part 1, p219. That address included he following words: Alstat was an early champion of the rights of women, including their education and their place in academia. In the 1930s, he worked with Trude Weiss-Rosmarin, teaching courses on Jewish History and Modern Jewish Problems at \\"The School of the Jewish Woman,\\" the institution she created on New York's Upper West Side, under the auspices of Hadassah. Carole S. Kessner, The \\"Other\\" New York Jewish Intellectuals, NYU Press, NY:1994, 106. This reference notes Alstat taught these courses as of 1937. Weiss- Rosmarin, and those who worked with her, felt that \\"Jewish women had been short-changed ... and saw education was the remedy.\\" \\"As an intellectual feminist,\\" Weiss-Rosmarin promoted the study of the liturgy, learning the meaning and history of the prayers, \\"to stimulate attendance of women at synagogue.\\" Through classes in history, philosophy, customs, and ceremonies, Alstat, along with the other well-known rabbis who taught at this school, helped promote this vision of increased education, not only for the women of that time, but also so that they could help their children. As Weiss-Rosmarin put it, \\"If you want your children to grow up as educated Jews, you yourself must become educated.\\" Alstat (center) witnessing a ketubah, Jewish marriage document, 1974 He was also involved in the spread and strengthening of the Conservative movement in many ways, speaking at many dedication ceremonies and other special events for Conservative congregations, as he did on September 17, 1927, for Ohev Shalom Synagogue Center, in a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He also was an important force in conversion studies for prospective converts to Judaism, individuals who would later come to be called, \\"Jews by choice.\\" He sometimes taught the courses himself, but he also supervised a network of rabbinical students who would meet one-on-one with conversion students. At one point, virtually all requests for conversions under the auspices of the Conservative movement in New York City were referred to him by Conservative colleagues. Among the rabbinical students who helped him with the final stages of conversion, including the mikveh(ritual immersion) and beit din(rabbinical court), Alstat was well known for the way that, no matter what new name was chosen by the convert, he would link that name, and the conversion itself, to the Biblical story of Ruth, the most famous convert in the Bible. Alstat lived in a JTS dormitory for forty-three years, serving as a counselor and mentor for generations of rabbinical students. He would share both his knowledge of Jewish subjects, and the practical techniques he had developed over the years for filing bits and pieces of information that later helped him with his columns, and could help rabbis with their articles and sermons. He was well known for speaking with rabbinic students upon their return from student pulpit positions during the Jewish High Holy Days, greeting them with the question, \\"How was your success?\\" This question would lead to serious discussions about the difference between success during a short visit and a successful rabbinic career that would span years. When rabbinical students were having a hard time putting together a eulogy for a funeral, he would advise them to ask the relatives, \\"What kind of a report card do you think this person would have received from God?\\" In his talks and even in the eulogies he delivered, he would teach that the way to \\"appraise and evaluate the life achievements of a rabbi\\" come from the Talmudic verse,Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Shabbat, p31a. where it is taught that we will be asked two questions: the second, whether we engaged in studies that were \\"Jewishly cultural and creative?\\"; but the very first, whether we dealt with others faithfully‚Äîwith integrity.Philip R. Alstat, Eulogy for Rabbi Alter Abelson, Rabbinical Assembly Proceedings, Vol 29(1965), pp139-141. In Alstat's own eulogy, he was called \\"the friend, confidant and adviser to several generations of rabbinical students. Over the years he became the rabbi's rabbi as colleagues sought his counsel and advice.\\" Sermons and articles Alstat was small in physical stature, 5' 2\\" tall, but he was a fiery and \\"towering\\" orator, whose sermons often created quite a stir among his congregants, and attracted the attention of the media. In 1928, the Bronx Jewish Herald included an article entitled, \\"Bronx Rabbi Takes a Fling at 'Lekovod Christmas' Jews.\\" (The Hebrew word indicates that the targets of his sermon were Jews who showed more respect and honor to Christmas than to their own holidays and faith.) The article began by referencing Alstat's sermon, \\"delivered from the pulpit of the Adath Israel, the new and attractive synagogue gracing the corner of Grand Concourse and 169th street,\\" and went on to say that, \\"Rabbi Philip R. Alstat took to task those Jews who act no different than the Judeo-Christians of eighteen centuries ago.\\" It quoted the sermon almost in its entirety, which described ways some Jews were celebrating Christmas by exchanging gifts and singing carols, and concluded as follows: > It is not our wish to stir up religious rancor, or to engage in theological > disputations or to draw odious comparisons between two faiths. Nothing is > further from our intentions. In fact we have the highest respect for the > Christian follower of Christianity. But eternal vigilance is the price a > minority must pay for its existence, and we cannot look on with indifference > when the weak members of the minority falter in their loyalty and succumb to > the seductive charms of the majority. ... There is no convenient compromise > between the \\"Mogen Dovid\\" and the cross, between \\"Adonai Echod\\" [note: these > are the words, \\"One God,\\" from the verse that begins with Shema Yisrael] and > the Trinitarian conception of the deity. Would that there were an Elijah to > confront the Judeo-Christians of 1928 and to hurl at them his challenge of > old: \\"How long halt ye between two opinions?\\".Bible Verse, Book of I Kings, > Chapter 18, verse 21. (A more modern translation is, \\"How long can you dance > between two opinions?\\"). ... Either be Jews or Christians ‚Äì there is no room > for Judeo-Christians in our midst! But, just as he could use words to admonish, he could use them to build up hope. In 1939, in the article, \\"Passover's Message to Modern Jewry,\\"The Canadian Jewish Chronicle, March 31, 1939 he counseled hope, and even gratitude, as part of Jewish strength to withstand the pain of events in Europe: This theme of remembering pain in the past in a way that helped build hope for the future was the focus of a 1938 sermon that was quoted in the New York Times,Liberty as Theme of Passover, New York Times, April 17, 1938 \\"Undaunted, we confidently expect that some day, somehow, the present low ebb of liberty and democracy will be followed by a rising tide whose onrush will irresistibly wash away the ramparts of tyranny.\\" His sermons and articles targeted the Jewish community, the United States, the \\"family of nations,\\" the \\"Jewish homeland in Palestine,\\" and frequently described the importance of the \\"Jewish State\\" ‚Äì a nation yet not created, but which he supported with both his words and his actions. He shared his vision of that State by proclaiming that, \\"Whether the Jewish State be large or small, its importance in the family of nations will be determined, not by its limited area, but by its creative genius and cultural contributions to mankind. Like Judaea and Athens of old, it may be only a small vessel, but exceedingly rich in precious content.\\"All Faiths Urged to Fight Dictators, New York Times, Nov 17, 1937. In addition to numerous articles of his own, he frequently translated articles from Yiddish papers for publication by the English-language press. Strange to Relate The photo of Alstat that accompanied hundreds of his newspaper articles. For almost 40 years, from 1938 through 1976, the year of his death‚Äîin some 1500 weekly columns ‚Äì Alstat wrote Strange to Relate, a column that revealed little-known information about Judaism, its people, its history, and its faith, and their intersection with American and World events. The columns appeared in both English and Yiddish papers, including The American Examiner, and The New York Jewish Week. Quoting poetry, literature, and the latest news stories, ranging from scientific discoveries to international events, he wrote articles about the often surprising and usually unanticipated \\"Jewish connections\\" in the news. From the fact that the story of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah is recorded in the Catholic Bible's Book of Maccabees, but not in the Hebrew Bible; to the way the ancient Jewish prayer for the New Moon had to be changed after the first lunar moon landing‚Äîtaking out the phrase, \\"but we have never touched you\\"; to the fact that, after World War II, German money helped print a 17-volume edition of the Talmud ‚Äì when the Survivors' Talmud (also known as the U.S. Army Talmud, because it was dedicated to the U.S. Army) was published, based on the realization that many Jews in the displaced persons camps were as hungry for Jewish books as they were for food; to scientific theories offered by a Russian about the way an unusual alignment of the planets caused the splitting of the Red Sea; to the way Talmudic rabbis, not Benjamin Franklin, invented the lightning rod,Jewish Youth Journal, February 1938, quoting Tosephta of Tractate Sabbath, Ch VI, \\"It is proper to place an iron rod over chicken coops in order to protect them against thunder and lightning\\". his articles were read by lay people and Jewish leaders alike. These few examples of the titles of his columns reveal the wide range of his topics: *Jewish Aspects of Moon Exploration *Jewish Aspects of Benjamin Franklin *President Lyndon Johnson, Through Jewish Eyes *Golda Meir Recalls Her Rosh Hashanah in Moscow His columns were frequently quoted by rabbis throughout the country in sermons and columns. Additionally, in letters to the editor and personal correspondence, readers would write about \\"their indebtedness to him for their revived interest in Torah and the people of Israel.\\". The columns were frequently reprinted in the works of others during his lifetime, and long after his death. For example, this story of the 13th century Jewish philosopher, Abraham Abulafia, was included in the 1995 collection, A Treasury of Jewish Anecdotes:Lawrence Jeffrey Epstein, A Treasury of Jewish Anecdotes, Jason Aronson, NY:1995, p9, reprinted from Jewish Week, August 30, 1975. > In the summer of 1280, Abraham Abulafia went to Rome to convert the Pope to > Judaism. He wanted to meet Pope Nicklaus III on the eve of the Jewish New > Year and persuade the leader of the world's Roman Catholics to become a Jew. > The Pope, then at a summer house, heard of the plan, and ordered that > Abulafia be burned at the stake. Abulafia arrived at the gate of the papal > residence, but he was not arrested. The Pope had died as a result of an > apoplectic stroke during the preceding night. Abulafia was jailed for 28 > days and then released. In addition to this column, he wrote frequent book reviews, including one of the first for The Earth is the Lord's, by Abraham Joshua Heschel.Jewish Examiner. March 24, 1958, cited in Edward Kaplain, Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America, 1940‚Äì1972, Yale University Press:2007, p.397. Additionally, he worked behind-the-scenes to support the work of many colleagues, often acknowledged in the book's preface, even after his death, as he was in the 1992 study, Economic analysis in Talmudic literature: rabbinic thought in the light of modern economics.Roman A. Ohrenstein, Barry Lewis, John Gordon, Economic analysis in Talmudic literature: rabbinic thought in the light of modern economics, Vol 40 in Studia Post-Biblica, Brill:1992, xviii. Honors and memorials After his death, the Rabbi Philip R. Alstat Prize for Literary Achievement was established at JTS for an outstanding rabbinical student; and two endowed JTS chairs, The Rabbi Philip R. Alstat Associate Professor of Talmud, and The Rabbi Philip R. Alstat Assistant Professor of Liturgy, were created in his memory. However, in addition to such formal tributes to his life and his work, his most long-lasting memory may continue in the work of the countless rabbis whose hearts and minds this rabbi's rabbi touched during their time in rabbinical school. As Rabbi William Berkovitz, at that time, the spiritual leader of New York's Congregation B'nai Jeshurun, wrote in the New York Times:New York Times, Dec 3, 1976 > The obituary notice of The New York Times made the observation that \\"Rabbi > Philip R. Alstat left no survivors.\\" However, those of us who attended the > Jewish Theological Seminary during the last four decades know otherwise. We > ‚Äì his students ‚Äì are his survivors. We ‚Äì his colleagues ‚Äì are his link to > the future. And we ‚Äì his friends ‚Äì are the living witnesses to his enduring > influence for over half a century, he built an empire of friendship, > embracing students, scholars and all Jews, regardless of status or station > in life And yet, he was more than teacher, colleague, and friend. He was a > gifted spiritual mentor, a masgiach ruchani, whose wisdom kindled light when > we were in darkness, whose counsel brought direction when we were lost in > confusion, whose encouragement offered hope when we were caught in despair. > Alas, the seminary halls will no longer be the same. Alas, the dormitory > quarters will never be empty and desolate, devoid of his unique personality. > Gone will be the gentle wit and gifted storyteller, gone will be the sage > counselor and pius Jew, gone will be the humble spirit and songful soul, > alas, gone will be Rabbi Alstat. We, his sorrowing family of disciples, > mourn his passing but shall ever continue to invoke his spirit. His memory > will ever be blessed. In a final tribute to this great man, Rabbi Alstat's name and legacy live on in his first cousin's great-great-grandson, who was born 28 years after his death and is named after him.

Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc., 952 F. Supp. 1119 (W.D. Pa. 1997). Facts of the Case Plaintiff Cybersell, Inc. (\\"Cybersell AZ\\"), an Arizona corporation with principals Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, was incorporated in May 1994 providing advertisements for commercial services over the Internet. In August 1994, Cybersell AZ filed an application to register the name ‚ÄúCybersell‚Äù as a service mark, and was approved for trademark registration using cyber.sell.com in October 1995. In February 1995, the site was then taken down for reconstruction. In May 1995, while Cybersell AZ was in the process of registering as a federal service mark, Cybersell, Inc. (\\"Cybersell FL\\"), a Florida corporation formed ‚Äúto provide business consulting services for strategic management and marketing on the web‚Äù established a website advertising its services at cybsell.com.Cybersell, Inc. v Cybersell, Inc. , 130 F.3d 414 (9th Cir. 1997). Cybersell FL used their website to provide contact information for their business, including their phone number and email address. After Cybersell AZ learned of Cybersell FL's website and use of their \\"Cybersell\\" service mark, Cybersell AZ notified Cybersell FL that they were infringing on Cybersell AZ's mark. As a result, Cybersell FL changed their name to WebHorizons, and later to WebSolvers, Inc., ‚Äúto disassociate themselves‚Äù from Cybersell AZ, however, they left ‚ÄúWelcome to Cybersell!‚Äù on their web page. Cybersell AZ then filed the complaint in this action alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, fraud, and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) violations in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona.On the same day, Cybersell FL filed for declaratory relief in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The action was transferred to the Arizona District Court where it was consolidated with the action filed by Cybersell AZ. Cybersell, 130 F.3d at 416. Cybersell AZ alleged that personal jurisdiction over Cybersell FL was proper because the internet is without borders, and a website which advertises a product or service is necessarily intended for use on a worldwide basis. Cybersell FL moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court granted the motion and Cybersell AZ appealed. Opinion The court applied the ‚Äúminimum contacts‚Äù test to determine whether the court could exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant: \\"(1) The nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the forum or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections[;] (2) the claim must be one which arises out of or results from the defendant's forum-related activities[; and] (3) exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable.\\"Cybersell, 130 F.3d at 416 (citing Ballard v. Savage, 65 F.3d 1495, 1498) (9th Cir. 1995). The court determined that Cybersell FL‚Äôs conduct did not amount to purposeful availment under the first prong of the minimum contacts test. The court looked to its discussion of purposeful availment in Ballard v. Savage, noting that the ‚Äú‚Äòpurposeful availment‚Äô requirement is satisfied if the defendant has taken deliberate action within the forum state or if he has created continuing obligations to forum residents. ‚ÄòIt is not required that a defendant be physically present within, or have physical contacts with the forum, provided that his efforts ‚Äòare purposefully directed‚Äô toward forum residents.‚Äô‚Äù Having yet to rule on personal jurisdiction ‚Äúin the context of cyberspace‚Äù the court looked to Second and Sixth Circuit decisions for guidance, namely CompuServe, Inc. v. Patterson89 F.3d 1257 (6th Cir. 1996) and Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King.937 F. Supp. 295 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), aff'd, 126 F.3d 25, 1997 WL 560048 (2d Cir. 1997) In CompuServe, the court ruled that the defendant purposefully availed himself of the privilege of doing business in Ohio when the defendant transmitted his product from Texas to CompuServe‚Äôs system in Ohio, and the system provided access to his software to others to whom he advertised and sold his product.See generally CompuServe, 89 F.3d 1257. In contrast, the defendant in Bensusan created a general access web page containing information about its service and ticketing information. The court ruled that the defendant‚Äôs action did not amount to purposeful availment, rather was just passive web page and did not subject the defendant to personal jurisdiction.See generally Bensusan, 937 F. Supp. 295. See also Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc., 952 F. Supp. 1119 (W.D. Pa. 1997)(holding that interactive websites, in contrast to passive websites, should be assessed for purposes of personal jurisdiction based on the ‚Äúlevel of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of the information that occurs on the Web site‚Äù). The Ninth Circuit determined that Cybersell FL only passively advertised on the internet using the name ‚ÄúCybersell‚Äù and did not deliberately direct merchandising efforts toward Arizona residents. The court found that Cybersell FL did nothing to encourage people in Arizona to access its site, no Arizona residents signed up for Cybersell FL‚Äôs web construction services, and that there were no sales, no telephone calls, no income, no message, and no \\"hits\\" from Arizonans (other than by Cybersell AZ). Moreover, Cybersell FL did not have an ‚Äú800‚Äù number.Cybersell AZ argued that the court should follow the District of Connecticut's ruling in Inset Systems, Inc. v. Instruction Set, Inc., 937 F. Supp. 161 (D. Conn. 1996), where a relatively passive website combined with a \\"1-800\\" number using the contested mark was sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. The Ninth Circuit found that Cybersell FL's lack of a 1-800 number using the contested mark to distinguish the facts in Cybersell from those in Inset. Cybersell, 130 F.3d at 419. In sum, Cybersell FL had done no act and consummated no transaction, nor had it performed any act by which it purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities, in Arizona, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of Arizona law. Cybersell FL lacked sufficient minimum contacts with Arizona for personal jurisdiction. Accordingly, its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was properly granted. The court also set aside Cybersell AZ‚Äôs argument that the Calder ‚Äúeffects‚Äù test The Calder \\"effects\\" test is a test for personal jurisdiction articulated in Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984). provided grounds for personal jurisdiction because Cybersell AZ did not suffer harm in a particular geographic location in the same sense that an individual would. Cybersell FL‚Äôs web page simply was not aimed intentionally at Arizona knowing that harm was likely to be caused there to Cybersell AZ. See also *Zippo Manufacturing Co. v.

Life  Born in Vienna on 10 March 1928, he was a member of the Wiener S√§ngerknaben boys' choir from 1938 to 1944. From 1952, Balatsch was a baritone in the opera chorus of the Vienna State Opera. A year later, he also became the conductor of a Vienna men's chorus, the . At the State Opera, he eventually became the long-term choral conductor at the house, first leading the Extrachor from 1965, then as vice choral conductor in 1967, and in 1968 as Chordirektor (chorus director), a position he held until 1983.

Cuba Between Reform and Revolution. New York: Oxford UP, 1995. Print. It began in April 1961 and ended on December 22, 1961, successfully raising Cuba's literacy rate to nearly one-hundred percent.Uriarte, Miren. Cuba: Social Policy at the Crossroads: Maintaining Priorities, Transforming Practice. An Oxfam America Report. 2002, pp. 6-12. , December 2004. Before 1959 the literacy rate for Cuba was approximately 77%, as noted by UNESCO. This was the 4th highest rate in Latin America. The Cuban government of Fidel Castro at Che Guevara‚Äôs behest dubbed 1961 the \\"year of education\\" and sent \\"literacy brigades\\" out into the countryside to construct schools, train new educators, and teach the predominantly illiterate guajiros (peasants) to read and write. By the completion of the campaign, deemed \\"a remarkable success,‚Äù 707,212 adults were taught to read and write, raising the national literacy rate to 96%.Kellner 1989, p. 61. By 2010 UNESCO claimed Cuba's literacy rate for those above the age of 15 to be 99 percent. Economists at Oxford University‚Äôs Our World In Data project (using a compilation of Oxford, World Bank, and UNESCO resources) calculated that, during that same 50-year period (1960‚Äì2010), Bolivia‚Äôs literacy rate increased from 44 to 92 percent; Brazil‚Äôs from 60 to 91 percent; Colombia‚Äôs from 70 to 94 percent and Paraguay‚Äôs from 73 to 94 percent. As of 2011, the median reported literacy rate for Latin America and the Caribbean was 93 percent. In 2011, producer and director Catherine Murphy released the 33-minute documentary Maestra about the Cuban literacy campaign. The film includes interviews with volunteers who taught during the campaign and archival footage from 1961. Background=Reforms The dictator Fulgencio Batista was overthrown by an armed guerrilla movement known as the 26th of July Movement (Movimiento 26 de Julio) on January 1, 1959.\\"Cuban Revolution.\\" International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 2008. www.encyclopedia.com. 11 March 2010 The new revolutionary government, led by Fidel Castro, immediately began a series of social and economic reforms. Among these were agrarian reform, health care reform, and education reform, all of which dramatically improved the quality of life among the lowest sectors of Cuban society.Serra, Ana. The \\"New Man\\" in Cuba Culture and Identity in the Revolution (Contemporary Cuba). New York: University of Florida, 2007. Print. Emigration During the turmoil of the first several years of the revolution, the flight of many skilled workers caused a ‚Äúbrain drain.‚Äù This loss of human capital sparked a renovation of the Cuban education system to accommodate the instruction of new workers, who would take the place of those who had emigrated from the country.Klein, Deborah. \\"Education as Social Revolution.\\" Independent School 63.3 (2004): 38-47.EBSCO. Web. 20 February 2010. Ideological developments In addition to the renewal of Cuba‚Äôs infrastructure, there were strong ideological reasons for education reform. In pre-Revolutionary Cuba, there was a dichotomy between urban citizens and rural citizens (who were often agricultural workers). The Cuban Revolution was driven by the need for equality, particularly among these classes. Before the campaign, the rate of illiteracy among city dwellers was 11% compared to 41.7% in the countryside.Jeffries, C. Illiteracy: A World Problem. London: Pall Mall Press. 1967. Print. The Literacy Campaign was designed to force contact between sectors of society that would not usually interact. So much so that the government placed urban teachers in rural environments, where they were pushed to become like the peasants in order to break down social barriers. As Fidel Castro put it in 1961 while addressing literacy teachers, ‚ÄúYou will teach, and you will learn.‚Äù Volunteers from the city were often ignorant of the poor conditions of rural citizens until their experiences during this campaign. Besides literacy, the campaign aimed to create a collective identity of ‚Äúunity, [an] attitude of combat, courage, intelligence, and a sense of history.‚Äù Politicized educational materials were used to further these ideals.Chomsky, Aviva, Barry Carr, and Pamela M. Smorkaloff, eds. The Cuba Reader: History, Culture, Politics. Durham and London: Duke UP, 2003. Print. Furthermore, Castro went as far as to state the need for the rural populations to take on the role of teacher, educating the urban populations. The effort was labeled a movement of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and gave citizens a common goal, increasing solidarity.Supko, Ruth A. Perspectives on the Cuban National Literacy Campaign. Latin American Studies Association. 26 September 1998. Web. 20 February 2010..  History  The first whispers of the Cuban Literacy Campaign came about in the form of a preparatory period that lasted between September and December of 1960.  First Stage  Following this period, the campaign was set to be implemented through a 3-stage program. This occurred in 1961, a time also known as the 'Year of Education'.Lorenzetto, A., & Neys, K. (1971). Methods and Means Utilized in Cuba to Eliminate Illiteracy: UNESCO Report. The first stage consisted of professional educators training the literacy brigade ‚Äî known as the Alfabetizadores populares ‚Äî the curriculum and familiarizing them with the text that would be used to teach their students. This book, which had been written specifically for the purposes of the campaign was titled, Alfabeticemos (English: Let's Teach Literacy), brigadeers were also exposed to the student primer, which would help them to better educate their students. This primer is better known by its title, Venceremos (English: We Shall Conquer). This training time ran from January until late April in 1961.  Second Stage  Beginning in April, Castro elected to close schools down early for the summer. He did so in order to force students to supplement their missed class time by joining the literacy campaign and teach illiterate adults. This plan saw a number of students forced to join the campaign, approximately 105,664, and together they formed the Conrado Benitez Brigadistas. These student were put through a week long intensive to prepare them for the challenge ahead.  Third Stage  In an effort to intensify the campaign, and ensure its success before the end of the year, Castro began to recruit more \\"educators\\" from the factories, and those who enlisted formed the Patria o Muerte worker's brigade. This was the final effort to identify the remaining members of the population who were still illiterate, and find those who were struggling the most. Those who were unsuccessful in the traditional program were placed in acceleration camps to help them overcome illiteracy within Castro's one year timeline. Organization=Volunteers It is estimated that 1,000,000 Cubans were directly involved (as teachers or students) in the Literacy Campaign.(Fagen B). There were four categories of workers: # ‚ÄúConrado Benitez‚Äù Brigade (Conrado Benitez Brigadistas)‚Äî100,000 young volunteers (ages 10‚Äì19) who left school to live and work with students in the countryside. The number of students leaving schools to volunteer was so great that an alternative education was put in place for 8 months of the 1961 school year. # Popular Alphabetizers (Alfabetizadores populares)‚ÄîAdults who volunteered to teach in cities or towns. It is documented that 13,000 factory workers held classes for their illiterate co- workers after hours. This group includes the individuals who taught friends, neighbors, or family members out of their homes. # ‚ÄúFatherland or Death‚Äù Brigade (Patria o Muerte Brigadistas)‚ÄîA group of 15,000 adult workers who were paid to teach in remote rural locations through an arrangement that their co- workers would fill in for them, so that the workforce remained strong. # Schoolteacher Brigades‚ÄîA group of 15,000 professional teachers who oversaw the technical and organizational aspects of the campaign. As 1961 progressed, their involvement grew to the extent that most teachers participated full-time for a majority of the campaign. The \\"Fatherland or Death\\" brigade, along with the Schoolteacher brigade, is sometimes simply referred to as the Workers' Brigade (Brigadistas Obreros).Fagen, Richard R. Cuba: The Political Content of Adult Education. Stanford: Stanford University, 1964. Print.Supko, Ruth A. Perspectives on the Cuban National Literacy Campaign. Latin American Studies Association. 26 September 1998. Web. 20 February 2010. . The government provided teaching supplies to volunteers. Workers who traveled to rural locations to teach received a standard grey uniform, a warm blanket, a hammock, two textbooks ‚Äî Alfabeticemos and Venceremos ‚Äî and a gas-powered lantern, so that lessons could be given at night after work ended.Latin lessons: What can we Learn from the World‚Äôs most Ambitious Literacy Campaign? by The Independent, November 7, 2010Kozol, J. Children of the Revolution. New York: Delacorte Press. 1978. The campaign aimed to bring Cubans up to a standard reading level. The benchmark was set at achieving the reading ability of a first grader, a limit that allowed the organization to be more efficient and effective.  Gender roles  While much of the rhetoric surrounding the Cuban Literacy Campaign was focused on the creation of a new and better kind of man, it is important to recognize that with this came revolutionary changes in the roles of women in Cuba. While the campaign was mostly targeted towards men, over half of the educators who volunteered to further the effort were women. Many women also acted as beneficiaries, making them essential to the success of the program and contributors in a number of aspects.  Militarization of education  Women taking up the role of educators was not a new occurrence in Cuba, but the militarization of the role came about in conjunction with the Cuban Literacy Campaign. Castro himself claimed in a speech given in May of 1961, that the Cuban Revolution had two armies, the militias commonly associated with the revolution, and his \\"army of literacy teachers\\" or alfabetizadores who were responsible for waging war against illiteracy. A traditional responsibility of women was made to fit the Cuban ideals of heroism and service through means of militarization. The volunteers of the campaign were treated much like soldiers, organized into the aforementioned brigades, and were provided clothing resembling military fatigues regardless of their gender. From such a perspective the campaign is shrouded in hyper-masculinity, hiding the fact that women were a large driving force of the effort under the guise of \\"masculine ideals\\". Reactions=Attacks against teachers Young teachers were sometimes murdered by insurgents in the Escambray rebellion due to their ties to the Cuban government.Alvarez, Angel R. \\"The Early Years of Terrorist Operations Against Cuba.\\" Injustice in Miami. Cuban News Agency (ACN), 2002. Web. 28 February 2010. http://www.ain.cubaweb.cu/patriotas2/coberturacompleta/2005/jul15early.htm . There are numerous accusations that these militants were backed by the United States Government.Garc√≠a, Arelis. \\"The Crime in Limones Cantero is Still Fresh.\\" Escambray.Cu. Escambray, 11 December 2009. Web. 28 February 2010. . Criticism Supporters of the revolution who were too young or otherwise unable to participate in the downfall of Fulgencio Batista saw the campaign as an opportunity to contribute to the success of the new government and hoped to instill a revolutionary consciousness in their students. Many of the instructional texts used during the Literacy Campaign focused on the history of the Revolution and had strong political messages, which made the movement a target of opposition. Operation Peter Pan Some parents who were fearful of their children being put under military supervision and made to leave their homes to teach, had their children leave Cuba through Operation Peter Pan. Aftermath=Education improvements Many of the Literacy Campaign‚Äôs volunteers went on to pursue teaching careers, and the rate of teachers is now 11 times higher than it was before the revolution.Halebsky, Sandor, and John M. Kirk, eds. Cuba Twenty-Five Years of Revolution, 1959-1984. New York: Praeger, 1985. Print. Before the revolutionary government nationalized schools, private institutions often excluded large segments of society; wealthy Cubans often received exemplary instruction in private schools, while children of the working class received low-quality education or did not attend school at all. Education became accessible to a much larger segment of the population after 1959. The percentage of children enrolled in school in Cuba (ages 6‚Äì12) increased dramatically over the years: * 1953‚Äî56% * 1970‚Äî88% * 1986‚Äînearly 100% It is estimated that 268,000 Cubans worked to eliminate illiteracy during the Year of Education, and around 707,000 Cubans became literate by December 22, 1961.Bhola, H. S. Campaigning for Literacy. Paris: UNESCO. 1984. Print. By 1962, the country‚Äôs literacy rate was 96%, one of the highest in the world. The success of the campaign is owed in part to the fact that it brought the systematic issues in the country to the attention of the government. Major issues like health and healthcare in Cuba, as well the lack of accessibility for child care, and other disadvantages largely determined by class, were proving to be barriers to education in Cuba. This enlightenment allowed them to alter some of the structural issues that were inhibiting the overall education level of Cubans.Griffiths, T. G., & Williams, J. (2017). Mass schooling for socialist transformation in Cuba and Venezuela. In International Critical Pedagogy Reader (pp. 64-72). Routledge. International education campaigns Cuban literacy educators trained during the campaign went on to assist in literacy campaigns in 15 other countries, for which a Cuban organization was awarded the King Sejong Literacy Prize by UNESCO.Abendroth, Mark. Rebel Literacy: Cuba's National Literacy Campaign and Critical Global Citizenship. Duluth, MN: Litwin Books, 2009. Print. Additionally, over the past 50 years, thousands of Cuban literacy teachers have volunteered in countries such as Haiti, Nicaragua and Mozambique. Museum The thank-you letters to Fidel Castro, used by UNESCO to evaluate the success of the campaign in 1964, are kept with photographs and details of all 100,000 volunteers in a museum in La Ciudad Libertad (City of Liberty), which is in Fulgencio Batista's vast former headquarters in the western suburbs of Havana.

The highway has both of its endpoints, as well as all of its length, entirely within the Ponce city limits. It runs east to west.

The road runs from its eastern terminus at PR-132 (Calle Villa), which is the road leading from Guayanilla to Ponce through Pe√±uelas, to its western terminus at Barrio Canas where it ends at the Ponce Municipal Waste and Recycling Yard. Current course of the road The road has its eastern terminus at PR-132 (Calle Villa), in Barrio Canas Urbano, and its western terminus in Barrio Canas. A one-lane dirt road leads to PR-549 from there. The only major road PR-500 intersects is Avenida Baramaya (PR-9), at km 0.8. Prior to that, at km 0.3, PR-500 connects to PR-163 (Avenida Las Am√©ricas). The road ends at km 2.3, where the Vertedero Municipal de Ponce (Ponce's Municipal Waste Yard) is located. From km 2.3 an unmarked dirt road leads to PR-549, which leads to barrio Quebrada Lim√≥n in the western portion of the municipality of Ponce. In the 2000s decade, PR-500 was no longer transited by the oversized Ponce Cement (now CEMEX) trucks. Highway 500 is about one and one-half miles long, making one of the shortest highways in Puerto Rico. It is lined by residential areas with a short section lined by the Calle Villa Final industrial park, a light-industry industrial park.

The Equestrian monument to General Manuel Belgrano is a landmark of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is located at Plaza de Mayo, in front of the Casa Rosada. It depicts General Manuel Belgrano holding the Flag of Argentina, and it is made of bronze over a pedestal of granite. History In 1870 generals Bartolom√© Mitre, Enrique Mart√≠nez and Manuel Jos√© Guerrico appointed a commission with the task of making a monument for Manuel Belgrano. This was requested to the French sculptor Louis-Robert Carrier- Belleuse, who would make the statue of Belgrano, and Manuel de Santa Coloma, who designed the horse. It was finished in 1872 and moved to Buenos Aires, where it was dedicated on September 24, 1873, at an anniversary of the Battle of Tucum√°n. More than 20,000 people were present at the ceremony, and the Argentine National Anthem was played at Teatro Col√≥n that night. During the government of Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear it was thought that the base was too low, so it was raised. During the work the monument was rotated as well, and instead of watching towards to Buenos Aires Cabildo it was made to look to the North, so that it didn't show his back to the Casa Rosada.

It is the first known dictionary of the vernacular Serbian language.  Development  Karad≈æiƒá began collecting words of the Serbian vernacular in 1815, as suggested by Slovene linguist Jernej Kopitar. While working in court during his time in Serbia, he had a habit of \\"writing down an interesting word or two\\". The first published edition of the dictionary came out in 1818, and contained 26.270 words which Karad≈æiƒá had heard in the common speech. His source could also have been the Avramoviƒá Dictionary. Karad≈æiƒá's dictionary itself was one of the most important steps in his struggle for the Serbian language and grammar because it stated that the pure vernacular should provide the basis for a main literary language. Also reviewed in the dictionary were phonetic changes, later being a part of the Grammar of the Serbian language, which was later merged with the dictionary and translated by Jacob Grimm into German in 1824, while the dictionary itself was translated into Latin and German by Jernej Kopitar. Original with Vuk's notes. While being officially completed in 1816, the dictionary could not yet be published for a number of reasons, mainly due to the lack of resources and therefore means to print the dictionaries. While at the time there were no printing presses present in Serbia, printing such a work in Austria required the permission of Metropolitan Stefan Stratimiroviƒá, who saw Karad≈æiƒá's work in orthography as a threat to the Serbian Orthodox Church and its habits of educating Serbs with the so-called Slavonic-Serbian language, an adaptation of the Church Slavonic language. Karad≈æiƒá had also implemented the use of new, reformed letters within the dictionary. These included –à, –â, –ä, –Ç, –ã and –è. Words including the letter –•, which Karad≈æiƒá insisted to be used with foreign words only, did not appear in the first edition of the dictionary. However, Karad≈æiƒá was later persuaded by Lukijan Mu≈°icki and Pavle Solariƒá that the letter be used in some words, however \\"–•\\" was never attributed in the dictionary as a starting letter, and no words beginning with \\"–•\\" were included.  Criticism  The dictionary was sharply criticized and attacked by opponents of the language reform, a strong motive for this being the large amount of swear words present in the dictionary, which were included partly due to Kopitar's and Grimm's persuasions. Jacob Grimm showed a distinct interest in profanity within the Serbian language and in his correspondence with Karad≈æiƒá he requested their equivalent in German. Attacks held against the dictionary did not cease even after 1847, which was considered to be the year of victory for Karad≈æiƒá's reforms.

It was composed between 658 and 680 and is the oldest recorded Old English poem, being composed within living memory of the Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England. It is also one of the oldest surviving samples of Germanic alliterative verse. The \\"Hymn\\" is C√¶dmon's sole surviving composition. It was designed to be sung from memory and was later preserved in written form by others, surviving today in at least 19 verified manuscript copies. The poem has passed down from a Latin translation by Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People. It forms a prominent landmark and reference point for the study of Old English prosody, for the early influence which Christianity had on the poems and songs of the Anglo-Saxon people after their conversion.  History  Bede (B√¶d√¶ - as written on his tomb stone) wrote about the poet and his work in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, book 4, chapter 24. According to Bede, C√¶dmon was an illiterate cow-herder \\"who was actually employed by the monastery of Whitby\\" and who miraculously was able to recite a Christian song of creation in Old English verse. This miracle happened after C√¶dmon left a feast when they were passing a harp around for all to sing a song. He left the hall after feeling ashamed that he could not contribute a song. Later in a dream he said a man appeared to him and asked him to sing a song. C√¶dmon responded that he could not sing, yet the man told him that he could and asked him to \\"Sing to me the beginning of all things.\\" C√¶dmon was then able to sing verses and words that he had not heard of before. C√¶dmon then reported his experience first to a steward then to Hild, the abbess of Whitby. She invited scholars to evaluate C√¶dmon‚Äôs gift, and he was sent home to turn more divine doctrine into song. The abbess was so impressed with the success of his gift that she encouraged him to become a monk. He learned the history of the Christian church and created more music like the story of Genesis and many biblical stories which impressed his teachers. Bede says that C√¶dmon in his creation of his songs wanted to turn man from love of sin to a love of good deeds. C√¶dmon is said to have died peacefully in his sleep after asking for the Eucharist and making sure he was at peace with his fellow men. Like many Old English and Anglo-Latin pieces, it was designed to be sung aloud and was never physically recorded by C√¶dmon himself, but was written and preserved by other literate individuals. The Hymn itself was composed between 658 and 680, recorded in the earlier part of the 8th century, and survives today in at least 19 verified manuscript copies. The Hymn is C√¶dmon's sole surviving composition. The poem forms a prominent landmark and reference point for the study of Old English prosody, for the early influence which Christianity had on the poems and songs of the Anglo-Saxon people after their conversion. C√¶dmon's Hymn is the oldest recorded Old English poem, and also one of the oldest surviving samples of Germanic alliterative verse. Within Old English, only the inscriptions upon the Ruthwell Cross (doubtful) or Franks Casket (early 8th century) may be of comparable age. Outside of Old English, there are a few alliterative lines preserved in epigraphy (Horns of Gallehus, Pforzen buckle) which have a claim to greater age.  Manuscript witnesses  C√¶dmon's Hymn is known to have been copied in twenty one medieval manuscripts of Bede's Latin Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum or its Old English translation. Nineteen of these texts exist in their original state today. MS 134, Tournai, Biblioth√®que de la Ville was destroyed during World War II. The section containing C√¶dmon's Hymn in MS Cotton Otho B. xi, London, British Museum was destroyed in the 1731 Cottonian fire. However, the bare text survives through transcription (MS Additional 43703, London, British Library) made by Laurence Nowell in the 16th century. Even though MS Bodley 163, Oxford, Bodleian Library survives today, a corrector's attempt to remove the poem from the text has made it largely illegible. *MS 8245-57, Brussels, Biblioth√®que Royale *MS 41, Cambridge, Corpus Christi College *MS R. 5. 22, Cambridge, Trinity College *MS Kk. 3. 18, Cambridge, University Library *MS Kk. 5. 16, Cambridge, University Library (\\"The Moore Bede\\") *MS 547 [334], Dijon, Biblioth√®que Municipale *MS P. 5.i, Hereford, Cathedral Library *MS Additional 43703, London, British Library *MS Cotton Otho B. xi, London, British Museum *MS s.n, London, College of Arms *MS Bodley 163, Oxford, Bodleian Library *MS Hatton 43, Oxford, Bodleian Library *MS Laud Misc. 243, Oxford, Bodleian Library *MS Tanner 10, Oxford, Bodleian Library (\\"The Tanner Bede\\") *MS 279, Oxford, Corpus Christi College *MS Lat. 31, Oxford, Lincoln College *MS Lat. 105, Oxford, Magdalen College *MS Lat 5237, Paris, Biblioth√®que Nationale *MS Q. v.

The other candidate is St. Petersburg, National Library of Russia, lat. Q. v. I. 18 (P) All copies of the Hymn are found in manuscripts of the Historia ecclesiastica or its Old English translation, where they serve as either a gloss to Bede's Latin translation of the Old English poem, or, in the case of the Old English version, a replacement for Bede's translation in the main text of the Historia. Despite this close connection with Bede's work, the Hymn does not appear to have been transmitted with the Historia ecclesiastica regularly until relatively late in its textual history. Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy the vernacular text of the Hymn in manuscripts of the Latin Historia. In three cases ‚Äî Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243; Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43; and Winchester, Cathedral I ‚Äî the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter-century or more after the main text was first set down. Even when the poem is in the same hand as the manuscript's main text, there is little evidence to suggest that it was copied from the same exemplar as the Latin Historia: nearly identical versions of the Old English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions of the Latin text; closely related copies of the Latin Historia sometimes contain very different versions of the Old English poem. With the exception of the Old English translation, no single recension of the Historia ecclesiastica is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of the vernacular poem. Text and translation The manuscripts containing C√¶dmon's Hymn began to emerge in the eighth century, continuing through the twelfth. They show two separate manuscript environments, and the transformation of the hymn as it goes from an oral tradition to a literate one. In the West Saxon translation of the Historia ecclesiastica, the Hymn is made a part of the main text. However, in the Latin translation, the hymn appears only as a gloss to the paraphrase of the song. Between the fourteen manuscripts, the hymn only appears in two dialects. The importance of the two translations is that it shows the formatting practices of Latin and Old English during those five centuries. The word division, capitalization, punctuation, as well as where the text is found on the page all help to give fuller understanding to the Old English language which at the time was new to writing, as well as to its Latin counterpart, considered a textual language. The 8th-century Latin manuscripts of Historia ecclesiastica contain pronounced visual cues to help with the proper reading of the hymn. This is done by capitalization and by placing the text in two distinct columns. In later editions of Historia the hymn is laid out with each verse's first capital written in red, and the end of each verse written in a lighter color. The lighter ink expresses a caesura in the text while the darker ink shows a terminal punctuation. Despite the differences in the Hymn found in the Old English manuscripts, each copy of the hymn is metrically, semantically, and syntactically correct. These manuscripts bear testament of a supposed transitional period where oral poems were being placed into written word with the specific purpose of giving a predetermined message to its reader. The following Old English text is a normalized reading of manuscript M, the Moore Bede (Cambridge, University Library, MS Kk. 5. 16). This mid-8th century Northumbrian text is one of the oldest extant copies of the text. ; Old English : N≈´ scylun hergan hefaenrƒ´caes Uard, : metud√¶s maecti end his m≈çdgidanc, : uerc Uuldurfadur, suƒì hƒì uundra gihwaes, : ƒìci dryctin ≈çr ƒÅstelid√¶ : hƒì «£rist sc≈çp aelda barnum : heben til hr≈çfe, hƒÅleg scepen. : ThƒÅ middungeard moncynn√¶s Uard, : eci Dryctin, √¶fter tƒ´ad√¶ : firum foldu, Frƒìa allmectig. ; Latin (Bede) : Nunc laudare debemus auctorem regni caelestis, : potentiam creatoris, et consilium illius : facta Patris gloriae: quomodo ille, : cum sit aeternus Deus, omnium miraculorum auctor exstitit; : qui primo filiis hominum : caelum pro culmine tecti : dehinc terram custos humani generis : omnipotens creavit. ; Modern English translation : Now [we] must honour the guardian of heaven, : the might of the architect, and his purpose, : the work of the father of glory : as he, the eternal lord, established the beginning of wonders; : he first created for the children of men : heaven as a roof, the holy creator : Then the guardian of mankind, : the eternal lord, afterwards appointed the middle earth, : the lands for men, the Lord almighty. Form and role in Old English prosody C√¶dmon's Hymn was intended as an oral piece to be sung aloud. It is still not a hymn in the narrow sense of the formal and structural criteria of hymnody. It is, instead, a piece of Germanic alliterative poetry composed within living memory of the Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England. Although the suprasegmentals in the hymn's original form seem to show that when it was constructed it would have been regarded as a true hymn, it has been primarily considered by scholars since the 16th century as a poem. Nearly all Old English poetry (whether or not it was written or sung) follows the same general verse form, its chief characteristic being alliteration. As was common with poetry of the period, the nine lines of the Hymn are divided into eighteen half-lines by a medial caesura (pause or break in the middle of the line); the four principal stresses of each line are in turn divided evenly, allotting each half line with two stresses. It is generally acknowledged that the text can be separated into two rhetorical sections (although some scholars believe it could be divided into three), based on theme, syntax and pacing; the first being lines one to four and the second being lines five to nine. Bede himself stated (in regards to his own Latin translation of C√¶dmon's Hymn) that \\"it is impossible to make a literal translation, no matter how well written, of poetry into another language without losing some of the beauty and dignity\\" of the piece. In seeking to understand the mechanics of the oral Old English verse, practitioners of oral-formulaic analysis have tried to duplicate the supposed creating process of Anglo-Saxon poets. They posit that Old English poetry does indeed have a traditional formulaic style, and that this explains phrasal resemblances between various Anglo-Saxon poems; especially the work of Francis Magoun was highly influential, though his conclusions were doubted within a decade after his seminal publications on the subject, (\\"The Oral- Formulaic Character of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\\", 1953, and \\"Bede's Story of Caedmon: The Case History of an Anglo-Saxon Oral Singer\\", 1955) and \\"the presence of formulae in verse (a critical element in defining oral character) is ambiguous evidence at best\\". The poetry of this period was the result of a transitional time in literature, where oral poems and songs were being translated and modified for the purpose of reading. This process would have been more than likely done by English monks and clergymen, who not only were educated in Christian Latin literature but were familiar with oral traditions and translating them into written poetry. Originality and significance C√¶dmon utilised a form of Anglo-Saxon poetry traditionally used for the veneration of kings and princes, and altered the conventions in a way that would cause it to refer to God instead of a monarch. For instance, the phrase ' (keeper of the kingdom) was changed to ' (keeper of the kingdom of heaven). There has been much scholarly debate and speculation as to whether or not there existed pre-C√¶dmonian Christian composers by whom C√¶dmon may have been influenced, but the mainstream opinion appears to be that it is \\"reasonably clear that C√¶dmon coined the Christian poetic formulas that we find in the Hymn\\". C√¶dmon‚Äôs work \\"had a newness that it lost in the course of time\\", but it has been asserted by many that his poetic innovations \\"entitle him to be reckoned a genius\\"; inasmuch as the content of the hymn might strike us as conventional or \\"banal\\", according to Malone (1961), \\"we are led astray by our knowledge of later poetry\\".

It originally aired on the UPN network on May 10, 1999. The episode concerns a confrontation between Brendon Small and local bully Shannon, after Brendon discovers Shannon has been physically harassing his friend Jason. Brendon decides to record his preparation for the fight, as well as the fight itself, in order to create a documentary. \\"The Art of the Sucker Punch\\" was written using \\"retroscripting,\\" where each cast member completely improvised their lines, though certain script material was provided by co-creator and episode director Loren Bouchard. The episode was based on an experience co- creator and lead voice actor Brendon Small had at his school in his childhood with a bully. Comedian Emo Philips guest starred in the episode as Shannon. In its original broadcast, \\"The Art of the Sucker Punch\\" received a 1.0/2 Nielsen Rating, continuing a streak of low ratings the series had been receiving since the pilot episode. Despite very low ratings, the episode received generally positive reviews, with multiple commentators noting its portrayal of relatable life problems. Plot Aspiring filmmaker and eight-year-old Brendon Small discovers that his best friend, Jason, has been physically harassed by local neighborhood bully Shannon on a daily basis. Vowing vengeance on Shannon for this crime, Brendon challenges the bully to a brawl, despite lacking both the physical aptitude and knowledge to actually engage in a fight. Despite this, he starts training and records the entire training process, deciding to turn it into a documentary, implying that his actual motives behind the fight was to just create such a film about himself. Throughout his training process, several members of his community note their complete disbelief in Brendon's chances of actually coming out of the fight victoriously. The day of the fight finally comes, but when Brendon goes to engage Shannon, he is knocked to the ground immediately by a knee to the face. Despite this, Shannon calls Brendon the next day and invites him, Jason, and their friend Melissa to his birthday party, which Brendon resentfully accepts. When the kids arrive at Shannon's party, they see that no one has arrived. Shannon laments about how his bullying ways have caused no one he knows to actually like him, and the kids sympathize with the bully. However, Shannon then reveals that there are several kids at the party, who come out from hiding spots and ridicule Brendon, Jason, and Melissa for being swindled. As their retaliation, the children steal Shannon's lawn gnome and depart from the party. Production The episode was based on an experience series co-creator Brendon Small had with a bully. \\"The Art of the Sucker Punch\\" was inspired by a confrontation series co-creator Brendon Small had with a school bully when he was a child. The episode, as with the other first four episodes of the series, demonstrated a writing style known as \\"retroscripting,\\" in which the cast completely improvised their lines. In order to convincingly make the child characters sound like actual children despite being portrayed by adults, recordings of the actors' performance in the episode were electronically altered. Bouchard directed the episode, a role he filled for the entirety of the series' production run. Along with the rest of the first season, the episode was animated through the usage of \\"squigglevision,\\" a technique pioneered by the show's executive producer, Tom Sydner. The animation style consists of eight frames of looped \\"zigzagged\\" lines that stimulate the character's mouth movement. This style was used to produce the series on its incredibly low budget and allow for the actors to improvise. The animation style was eventually changed during the second season to Flash animation, which was believed to be a more conventional style.Booker, p. 181 \\"The Art of the Sucker Punch\\" is available on the DVD Home Movies: The Complete First Season, which was released on November 16, 2004. A bonus feature on the DVD allows for an optional audio commentary track, recorded by Small, Bouchard, and Benjamin, to play over the episode. Though generally being meant to be humorous and entertaining, the track also details actual information on the episode's production cycle. Reception Emo Philips (left) made his first guest appearance of the series in the episode as Shannon. \\"The Art of the Sucker Punch\\" originally aired on the UPN television network on May 10, 1999.Booker, p. 182 In this broadcast, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 1.0/2, which placed it as only the 114th most watched network television program of the week. In total, UPN averaged a 1.8 Nielsen rating with a 3% share of cable audiences that week. This continued a strand of poor ratings Home Movies had been receiving since its original broadcast. The pilot episode, \\"Get Away From My Mom,\\" received a Nielsen rating of 1.4/2 and placing as the 133rd most watched television program of the week. The following episode, \\"I Don't Do Well in Parent-Teacher Conferences,\\" was slightly higher, with a 1.4/2 Nielsen rating again, but ranking as the 113th television program that week. The episode has received generally positive reviews. In his book, Drawn to Television: Prime-time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy, M. Keith Booker cited the episode as an example of the series' prolific implication of simple, modern themes as a means of comedy. DVD Verdict reviewer David Ryan similarly wrote that the episode relied on a humor that was both easy to identify with and added a \\"tremendous amount of humor.\\" Conversely, reaction to the Shannon character has been much more critical. In his review for the series' fourth season DVD, DVD Talk's Francis Rizzo listed the character on his compilation of elements in the show he had a strong distaste for.

He was born in 1903 in Czƒôstochowa, Poland (then part of the Russian Empire) to a Jewish family. Imich, a supercentenarian, also became the oldest living man at age 111 after the death of almost 112-year-old Arturo Licata, of Italy, on April 24, 2014. Until his own death a little more than a month later, at the age of 111 years and 124 days, Imich was certified by Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living man. Imich was also the last surviving veteran of the Polish- Soviet War. Early war service Imich stated that, at age 15, he and the rest of his class joined the Polish forces to fight the Bolsheviks in 1918. His older brother reportedly served as an instructor in the automobile division, so Imich learned to drive trucks for the army until the Bolshevik forces were pushed back and Imich returned to school. Academic career He earned a Ph.D in zoology at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w in 1929, but as he could not find an academic position in zoology, he switched to chemistry. During the 1920s and 1930s he did some research on a medium, Matylda, for the Polish Society for Psychical Research. He published a report in 1932 in a German journal called Zeitschrift f√ºr Parapsychologie, but all of the unpublished notes and photos from the research were lost during World War II. World War II During World War II, Imich and his wife Wela (pronounced Vela) fled to Soviet-occupied Bia≈Çystok, where he was employed as a chemist. The couple were later interned in a labor camp for the duration of the war due to their refusal to accept Soviet citizenship. They were eventually freed and chose to emigrate to the U.S. in 1951, as almost all of their Polish relatives and friends were murdered in the Holocaust. Life in the United States In 1952, Imich and Wela (who died in 1986) emigrated to the United States, first to Pennsylvania and then to New York, dividing their time between both places. To make a living, Imich initially took up chemistry, but once Wela made a career for herself as a psychologist in 1965, he turned to parapsychology. After becoming a widower, he continued his lifelong interest in parapsychology, giving out the Imich prize for parapsychology research for several years until he began experiencing financial problems. Imich wrote numerous papers for journals in the field and edited a book, Incredible Tales of the Paranormal, which was published by Bramble Books in 1995. He formed the Anomalous Phenomena Research Center in 1999, trying to find a way to produce \\"The Crucial Demonstration\\", the goal of which is to demonstrate the reality of paranormal phenomena to mainstream scientists and the general public. In 2012, he began to transfer the records of his research into the paranormal to the University of Manitoba Department of Archives and Special Collections. Imich suffered a fall either on or shortly before his 111th birthday--with him spending his 111th birthday in the New York City's Roosevelt Hospital. After his release from Roosevelt Hospital, Imich belatedly celebrated his 111th birthday either in late April or early May 2014. After being the world's oldest living man for around 1.5 months, Alexander Imich died on June 8, 2014 at 9:03 AM from natural causes at the age of 111. He was succeeded as the world's oldest man by Sakari Momoi of Japan (who was born on February 5, 1903, just one day after Imich).

He is best known for playing Nikko, the head of the Winged Monkeys in the MGM film The Wizard of Oz (1939). He appeared in only a few films, as most of his work was in theater, vaudeville and circus. Life and career A 350x350px Walshe was born as Patrick Walshe, on July 26, 1900, in New York City. Living his early years in Brooklyn, Walshe suffered from a form of restricted growth, and as a result never grew to be taller than 3'10\\". Walshe began performing in vaudeville shows and circuses at a young age. He made his first Broadway appearance in 1908 in Lew Fields's production of The Girl Behind the Counter, where he played \\"Thompkins\\", a waiter, a role he continued till the show ended in December 1910. Shortly after, he appeared in the Ringling Brothers Circus, run by the famed five Ringling Brothers. In following years, Walshe appeared in the Broadway show Hell; and was reunited with Fields for Bunty, Bulls and Strings, where he played \\"Mr MacGregor\\", a Scottish farmer. In 1913, Walshe heard that the American Play Company was producing Within the Law, with an entire cast of dwarf actors, and he wrote to them hoping for a part. The same year, he appeared in the Broadway production A Good Little Devil, starring Mary Pickford, where he played the roles of a gnome called \\"Huggermunk\\", and of a squirrel. In 1914, Walshe spent time with the Frank A. Robbins Circus. Many of Walshe's performances included playing animals, particularly monkeys and apes. Eventually he began to specialize in monkeys. This gained him popularity on the vaudeville circuit, where he appeared in shows such as Lew Fields's and Joe Weber's Reunion show. Appearing in many variety shows, Walshe earned prominence for his performances and received the nickname 'the Monkey Man'. His performances were known for their meticulous attention to detail. He made many visits to zoos to study primate behavior, and could faithfully mimick their physicality and sounds. A zookeeper he befriended allowed Walshe to enter the apes's cages to spend time closer to them. His performance was so realistic that, when wearing his costume, he was allegedly able to convince a particular chimp that he was an ape, scaring it. Rather than attaching fur to his body, Walshe had a costumer make a special fur suit for him. However, Walshe dealt with the makeup himself. With grey paint, he used highlights and shadows, as well as protruding false teeth and a wig to transform himself into a monkey. Walshe often worked directly with apes, which was dangerous due to the creatures's unpredictable nature. To minimize risk, Walshe was well acquainted with the apes with which whom appeared, had an in-depth knowledge of ape psychology, and was naturally comfortable around them. In addition to working with live apes simply to mimic their movements, Walshe also performed with them. One of his best-known performances was alongside the trained chimp Baldy, whose custodian Walshe was for several years. They performed their act in many shows, and did other stunts, such as riding a two-seated bicycle together. Working with Baldy's trainer, the two spent weeks inside Baldy's cage, to help prepare her for the performance, as well as simply studying her behavior. Walshe had a close bond with Baldy, and was known to carry a photo of her in his pocket. He described her as \\"the most intelligent of all performers of the animal kingdom\\". Throughout the 1920s, Walshe earned a high reputation for his act. At one point he worked as a businessman, though he found being a little person made it considerably difficult. His business was unsuccessful, and after a period of illness, he ceased his business activities and returned to performing. In 1928, Walshe was enlisted to appear in Rain or Shine, at the George M. Cohan Theatre, starring Joe Cook. In the Broadway musical, which centered on a circus, he appeared alongside fellow circus performers Fred Gregory (a noted acrobat for Barnum and Bailey) and Dave Chasen (later famous for his Chasen's restaurant). Unlike most of the principal cast, all three had extensive circus and carnival experience, and performed an act with various acrobatics and stunts. Walshe portrayed the role of marmoset, and one point was propelled from the end of a pole. Despite their prominence in the show, neither Gregory nor Walshe were credited in its program, but did receive billing on posters and were mentioned in press releases. For the rest of his career, Walshe continued to perform in vaudeville, variety shows, circuses, and some Broadway productions. From 1930‚Äì1931 he appeared in Fine and Dandy with Joe Cook, with whom he'd worked in 1928 in Rain or Shine. Walshe appeared alongside another dwarf actor, Hermon Ergotti, a German standing 3'8\\". They portrayed \\"The Colt\\", with Walshe doubling as \\"J. Newton Wheer\\". In 1936 Walshe appeared in Topsy Turvy Revue, billed as the 'midget Tarzan', again with Joe Cook. The Wizard of Oz On October 4, 1938, Walshe was cast in the most prominent role of his career: his feature film debut in The Wizard of Oz, where he played Nikko, the leader of the Winged Monkeys. Unlike the other monkeys, Nikko was a credited role, serving as the Wicked Witch's (played by Margaret Hamilton) Minion and second-in-command. Though he had no spoken lines, performing only through physical movement, he received on-screen credit (rare for bit players at the time). Instead of the simple stage makeup he generally used in his shows, he had to wear complex prosthetics designed by Jack Dawn. While the other monkeys wore simple rubber masks, Walshe needed to appear in closeups, so multi-piece prosthetic makeup was produced for him, moulded to his features and glued to his face. He also wore a full fur body suit, with a short open tunic as well as a tail and wings. Although Walshe is listed in the film's credits as \\"Nikko\\", and despite his frequent appearances, the name \\"Nikko\\" is never spoken. (In the book, the character is simply called \\"the Monkey King\\".) Many of the film's viewers wondered who \\"Nikko\\" was; some confused him with the Captain of the Winkie Guards (played by Mitchell Lewis). Had they known Walshe was 3'10\\" (like the monkey), and was well known for his animal impersonations, identifying his character would have been considerably easier. Later career, retirement From 1945‚Äì1946, Walshe performed with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Al Dean's Circus, at the Court Square Theater, and with the Cole Bros. Circus. He also made some other film appearances, with minor roles in Pinky, Roseanna McCoy, and 1941, and work as a stunt double. He had his only on-screen speaking role in Panic in the Streets (1950), where he played a newspaper peddler named Pat (after himself). Walshe eventually quit performing due to the physical demands of his work, but is still well remembered for his appearance in The Wizard of Oz. Death Walshe died on December 11, 1991 in Los Angeles, following a heart attack. At the age of 91, he was the last surviving credited cast member of The Wizard of Oz. His resting place is in Westwood Memorial Park.

She was married at the age of 17 to Louis Alexandre de Bourbon-Penthi√®vre, Prince de Lamballe, the heir to the greatest fortune in France. After her marriage, which lasted a year, she went to court and became the confidante of Queen Marie Antoinette. She was killed in the massacres of September 1792 during the French Revolution.  Life  Marie Therese de Savoie, princesse de Lamballe by (1790‚Äì1855) Princess of Lamballe 1788 by Anton Hickel at the Liechtenstein Museum, Vienna Duplessis Marie Th√©r√®se was born in Turin. Her father was Louis Victor, Prince of Carignano, a maternal grandson of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia and his mistress Jeanne d'Albert de Luynes. Her mother, Landgravine Christine of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, was the daughter of Ernest Leopold, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg and Princess Eleonore of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim- Rochefort (1686‚Äì1753). Her aunts included, Polyxena of Hesse-Rheinfels- Rotenburg, the wife of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia (Victor Amadeus III was her first cousin) and Caroline, Princess of Cond√© and wife of Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon. Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√© was another first cousin who was at the French court. Not much is known of her childhood.Hardy, B. C. (Blanche Christabel), The Princesse de Lamballe; a biography, 1908, Project Gutenberg  Marriage  On 31 January 1767, she was married by proxy to Louis Alexandre de Bourbon-Penthi√®vre, Prince of Lamballe, grandson of Louis XIV's legitimised son, Louis Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, and the only surviving son of Louis de Bourbon-Toulouse, Duke of Penthi√®vre. The marriage was arranged after it had been suggested by Louis XV as a suitable match, both the bride and the groom being members of a royal sideline, and it was accepted by her family because the King of Sardinia had long wished for an alliance between the House of Savoy and the Royal House of France: in the following years, further marriage alliances between France and Savoy would follow. The wedding by proxy, followed by a bedding ceremony and a banquet, was held at the Savoyard royal court in Turin and attended by the King of Sardinia and his court. On 24 January, the bride crossed the bridge of Beauvoisin between Savoy and France, where she left her Italian entourage and was welcomed by her new French retinue, who escorted her to her groom and father-in-law at the Chateau de Nangis. She was introduced to the French royal court at the Palace of Versailles by Maria Fortunata, Countess de La Marche in February, where she made a favorable impression. The marriage was initially described as very happy, as both parties were attracted to each other's beauty; after only a few months, though, Louis Alexandre was unfaithful with two actresses, which reportedly devastated Marie Th√©r√®se. She was comforted by her father-in-law, to whom she became close. In 1768, at the age of nineteen, Marie Th√©r√®se became a widow when her husband died of a venereal disease at the Ch√¢teau de Louveciennes, nursed by his spouse and sister. She inherited her husband's considerable fortune, making her wealthy in her own right. Her father-in-law successfully persuaded her to abandon her wish to become a nun and instead stay with him as his daughter. She comforted him in his grief, and joined him in his extensive charitable projects at Rambouillet, an activity which earned him the name \\"King of the Poor\\" and her the nickname \\"The Angel of Penthi√©vre\\". In 1768, after the death of the Queen, Princess Marie Ad√©la√Øde of France supported a match between her father and the dowager princess. She reportedly preferred a queen who was young and beautiful but lacked ambition; who could attract and distract her father from state affairs, leaving them to Madame Ad√©la√Øde. She supported the Dowager Princess de Lamballe as a suitable candidate for that purpose and was supported by the powerful Noailles family. However, the Princess de Lamballe was not willing to encourage the match herself and her former father-in-law, the Duke of Penthievr√©, was not willing to consent so the marriage plan never materialized. Additionally the Choiseul party at court opposed a re-marriage of the king, and according to the reports of the Austrian ambassador Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau: \\"Persons in power, imagine that a queen, judicious and amiable, who would succeed in gaining the affection of her husband, might open his eyes to the irregularities and the enormous abuses which exist in all departments here, and cause much embarrassment to those who direct them. They are consequently of opinion that it behoves them to divert the mind of the King from ideas of marriage; and I have very strong proofs that Madame de Gramont, more interested than any one in the mamtenance of the present abuses, has succeeded in persuading M. de Choiseul to renounce his own predilections in this affair.\\"Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 She lived at the H√¥tel de Toulouse in Paris and at the Ch√¢teau de Rambouillet. On 4 January 1769, there was an announcement of the marriage of Marie Th√©r√®se's sister-in-law Mademoiselle de Penthi√®vre, heiress to the greatest fortune in France, to the young Philippe d'Orl√©ans, duc de Chartres, an old friend of the late prince de Lamballe.  Lady-in-waiting  The princesse de Lamballe had a role to play in royal ceremonies by marriage, and when the new Dauphine, Marie Antoinette, arrived in France in 1770, she was presented to her along with the Dukes and Duchesses of Orl√©ans, Chartres, Bourbon and the other \\"Princes of the Blood\\" with her father-in-law in Compi√©gne. During 1771, the Duke de Penthi√©vre started to entertain more, among others the Crown Prince of Sweden and the King of Denmark; Marie Th√©r√®se acted as his hostess, and started to attend court more often, participating in the balls held by Madame de Noailles in the name of Marie Antoinette, who was reportedly charmed by Marie Th√©r√®se, and overwhelmed her with attention and affection that spectators did not fail to notice. In March 1771 the Austrian ambassador reported: :\\"'For some time past the Dauphiness has shown a great affection for the Princesse de Lamballe. . . . This young princess is sweet and amiable, and enjoying the privil√®ges of a Princess of the Blood Royal, is in a position to avail herself of her Royal Highness's favour.\\" The \\"Gazette de France\\" mentions Madame de Lamballe's presence in the chapel at high mass on Holy Thursday, at which the King was present, accompanied by the Royal Family and the Dukes of Bourbon and Penthi√®vre. In May 1771, she went to Fontainebleau, and was there presented by the king to her cousin, the future Countess of Provence, attending the supper after. In November 1773, another one of her cousins married the third prince, the Count of Artois, and she was present at the birth of the future Louis-Philippe of France in Paris in October 1773. After her cousins had married Marie-Antoinette's brothers-in-law, the royal princes, Marie Th√©r√®se de Lamballe came to be treated by Marie-Antoinette as a relation, and during these first years, the counts and countesses of Provence and Artois formed a circle of friends with Marie-Antoinette and the princesse de Lamballe and spent a lot of their time together, the princesse de Lamballe being described as almost constantly by Marie-Antoinette's side. The empress Maria Theresa somewhat disliked the attachment, because she disliked favorites and intimate friends of royalty in general, though the princesse de Lamballe was because of her rank regarded as an acceptable choice, if such an intimate friend was needed. On 18 September 1775, following the ascension of her husband to the throne in May 1774, Queen Marie Antoinette appointed Marie Th√©r√®se \\"Superintendent of the Queen's Household\\", the highest rank possible for a lady-in-waiting at Versailles. This appointment was controversial: the office had been vacant for over thirty years because the position was expensive, superfluous and gave far too much power and influence to the bearer, giving her rank and power over all other ladies-in-waiting and requiring all orders given by any other female office holder to be confirmed by her before it could be carried out, and Lamballe, though of sufficient rank to be appointed, was regarded too young, which would offend those placed under her, but the queen regarded it a just reward for her friend. After Marie Antoinette became queen, her intimate friendship with Lamballe was given greater attention and Mercy reported: :\\"Her Majesty continually sees the Princesse de Lamballe in her rooms [...] This lady joins to much sweetness a very sincere character, far from intrigue and all such worries. The Queen has conceived for some time a real friendship for this young Princess, and the choice is excellent, for although a Piedmontese, Madame de Lamballe is not at all identified with the interests of Mesdames de Provence and d'Artois. All the same, I have taken the precaution to point out to the Queen that her favour and goodness to the Princesse de Lamballe are somewhat excessive, in order to prevent abuse of them from that quarter.\\" Empress Maria Theresa tried to discourage the friendship out of fear that Lamballe, as a former princess of Savoy, would try to benefit Savoyan interest through the queen. During her first year as queen, Marie Antoinette reportedly said to Louis XVI, who himself was very approving of her friendship with Lamballe: \\"Ah, sire, the Princesse de Lamballe's friendship is the charm of my life.\\" Lamballe welcomed her brothers at court, and upon the queen's wish, Lamballe's favorite brother Eug√®ne was granted a lucrative post with his own regiment in the French army to please his sister; later, Lamballe was also granted the governorship of Poitiou for her brother-in-law by the queen. Princesse de Lamballe was described as proud, sensitive and with a delicate though irregular beauty. Not a wit and not one to participate in plots, she was able to amuse Marie Antoinette, but she was of a reclusive nature and preferred to spend time with the queen alone rather than to participate in high society: she suffered from what was described as \\"nerves, convulsions, fainting-fits\\", and could reportedly faint and remain unconscious for hours. The office of Superintendent required that she confirmed all orders regarding the queen before they could be performed, that all letters, petitions, or memoranda to the queen was to be channeled through her, and that she entertain in the name of the queen. The office aroused great envy and insulted a great number of people at court because of the precedence in rank it gave. It also gave the enormous salary of 50,000 crowns a year, and because of the condition of the state's economy and the great wealth of Lamballe, she was asked to renounce the salary. When she refused for the sake of rank and stated that she would either have all the privileges of the office or retire, she was granted the salary by the queen: this incident aroused much bad publicity and Lamballe was painted as a greedy royal favorite, and her famous fainting spells widely mocked as manipulative simulations. She was openly talked about as the favorite of the queen, and was greeted almost as visiting royalty when she traveled around the country during her free time, and had poems dedicated to her. In 1775, however, Lamballe was gradually replaced in her position as the favorite of the queen by Yolande de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac. The outgoing and social Yolande de Polastron referred to the reserved Lamballe as a boor, while Lamballe disliked the bad influence she regarded Polignac to have over the queen. Marie Antoinette, who was unable to make them get along, started to prefer the company of Yolande de Polastron, who could better satisfy her need for amusement and pleasure. In April 1776, Ambassador Mercy reported: \\"The Princesse de Lamballe loses much in favour. I believe she will always be well treated by the Queen, but she no longer possesses her entire confidence\\", and continued in May by reporting of \\"constant quarrels, in which the Princesse seemed always to be in the wrong\\". When Marie Antoinette started to participate in amateur theater at Trianon, Polignac convinced her to refuse Lamballe admission to them, and in 1780, Mercy reported: \\"the Princesse is very little seen at court. The Queen, it is true, visited her on her father's death, but it is the first mark of kindness she has received for long.\\" Though de Lamballe was replaced by de Polignac as favorite, the friendship with the queen nevertheless continued on an on-and-off-basis: Marie Antoinette occasionally visited her in her rooms, and reportedly appreciated her serenity and loyalty in between the entertainments offered her by Polignac, once commenting, \\"She is the only woman I know who never bears a grudge; neither hatred nor jealousy is to be found in her.\\" After the death of her mother, Marie Antoinette isolated herself with Lamballe and Polignac during the winter to mourn. Lamballe kept her office of superintendent at court after she lost her position as favorite, and continued to perform her duties; she hosted balls in the name of the queen, introduced debutantes to her, assisted her in receiving foreign royal guests, and participated in the ceremonies around the birth of the queen's children and the queen's annual Easter Communion. Outside of her formal duties, however, she was often absent from court, attending to the bad health of both herself and her father-in-law. She engaged in her close friendship with her own favorite lady-in-waiting Countess √âtiennette d'Amblimont de L√¢ge de Volude, as well as her charity and her interest in the Freemasons. De Lamballe as well as her sister-in-law became inducted in the Freemasonic women's Adoption Lodge of St. Jean de la Candeur in 1777, and was made Grand Mistress of the Scottish Lodge, the head of all the Lodges of Adoption, in January 1781: though Marie Antoinette did not become a formal member, she was interested in Freemasonry and often asked Lamballe of the Adoption Lodge. During the famous Affair of the Diamond Necklace, Lamballe was seen in an unsuccessful attempt to visit the imprisoned Jeanne de la Motte at La Salpetriere; the purpose of this visit is unknown, but it created widespread rumors at the time. De Lamballe had long suffered from a weak health, which deteriorated so much during the mid 1780s that she was often unable to perform the duties of her office; at one occasion, she even engaged Deslon, a pupil of Mesmer, to magnetize her. She spent the summer of 1787 in England, advised by doctors to take the English waters in Bath to cure her health. This trip was much publicized as a secret diplomatic mission on behalf of the queen, with speculations that she was to ask the exiled Minister Calonne to omit certain incidents from the memoirs he was about to publish, but Calonne was in fact not in England at that time. After the visit to England, Lamballe's health improved considerably, and she was able to participate more at court, where the queen now gave her more affection again, appreciating her loyalty after the friendship between Marie Antoinette and Polignac had started to deteriorate. At this point, Lamballe and her sister- in-law joined in with the Parliament to petition on behalf of the duke of Orl√©ans, who was exiled. In the spring of 1789, Lamballe was present in Versailles to participate in the ceremonies around the Estates General of 1789 in France. Marie Th√©r√®se was by nature reserved and, at court, she had the reputation of being a prude. However, in popular anti-monarchist propaganda of the time, she was regularly portrayed in pornographic pamphlets, showing her as the Queen's lesbian lover to undermine the public image of the monarchy.Chantal Thomas, The Wicked Queen: The Origins of the Myth of Marie- Antoinette  Revolution  During the Storming of the Bastille in July 1789 and the outbreak of the French Revolution, the princesse de Lamballe was on a leisure visit in Switzerland with her favorite lady-in-waiting countess de L√¢ge, and when she returned to France in September, she stayed with her father-in-law in the countryside to nurse him while he was ill, and thus was not present at court during The Women's March on Versailles, which took place on 5 October 1789, when she was with her father-in-law in Aumale. On 7 October she was informed of the events of the Revolution, and immediately joined the Royal Family to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where she reassumed the duties of her office. She and Madame Elizabeth shared the apartments of the Pavillon de Flore in the Tuileries, in level with the Queen's, and except for brief visits to her father-in-law or her villa in Passy, she settled there permanently. In the Tuileries, the ritual court entertainments and representational life was to some level reinstated. As the king held his lev√©es and couchers, the queen held a card party every Sunday and Tuesday, and held a court reception on Sundays and Thursdays before attending mass and dining in public with the king, as well as giving audience to the foreign envoys and the official deputations each week; all events in which Lamballe, in her office of superintendent, participated, being always seen at the queen's side both in public as well as in private. She accompanied the royal family to St. Cloud in the summer of 1790, and also attended the F√™te de la F√©d√©ration at the Champ de Mars in Paris in July. Previously often unwilling to entertain in the queen's name as her office required, during these years she entertained lavishly and widely in her office at the Tuileries, where she hoped to gather loyal nobles to help the queen's cause, and her salon came to serve as a meeting place for the queen and the members of the National Constituent Assembly, many of whom the queen wished to win over to the cause of the Bourbon Monarchy. It was reportedly in the apartment of Lamballe that the queen had her political meetings with Mirabeau. In parallel, she also investigated the loyalty among the court staff through a network of informers. Madame Campan described how she was interviewed by Lamballe, who explained that she had been informed that Campan had been receiving deputies in her room and that her loyalty toward the monarchy had been questioned, but that Lamballe had investigated the accusations by use of spies, which had cleared Campan from the charges; \\"The Princesse then showed me a list of the names of all those employed about the Queen's chamber, and asked me for information concerning them. Fortunately, I had only favorable information to give, and she wrote down everything I told her.\\" After the departure from France of the duchess de Polignac and most of the other of the queen's intimate circle of friends, Marie Antoinette warned Lamballe that she would now in her visible role attract much of the anger among the public toward the favorites of the queen, and that libels circulating openly in Paris would expose her to slander. Lamballe reportedly read one of these volumes, and was informed of the hostility voiced toward her in them. De Lamballe supported her sister-in- law the duchess of Orl√©ans when she filed for divorce from the duke of Orl√©ans, which has been viewed as a reason of discord between Lamballe and Orl√©ans; though the duke had often used Lamballe as an intermediary to the queen, he reportedly never quite trusted her, since he expected Lamballe to blame him for encouraging the behavior which caused the death of Lamballe's late spouse, and when he was informed that she had ill will toward him during this affair, he reportedly broke with her. She was not informed beforehand of the Flight to Varennes. The night of the escape in June 1791, the queen said goodnight to her and advised her to spend some days in the country for the sake of her health before she retired; Lamballe found her behavior odd enough to remark about it to M. de Clermot, before leaving the Tuileries to retire to her villa in Passy. The day after, when the royal family had already departed during the night, she received a note from Marie Antoinette who told her about the flight and told her to meet her in Brussels. In the company of her ladies- in-waiting countess √âtiennette de L√¢ge, countess de Ginestous and two male courtiers, she immediately visited her father-in-law in Aumale, informed him of her flight and asked him for letters of introduction. She departed France from Boulogne to Dover in England, where she stayed for one night before continuing to Oostende in the Austrian Netherlands, where she arrived on 26 June. She continued to Brussels, where she met Axel von Fersen and the count and countess de Provence, and then to Aix-la-Chapelle. She visited Gustav III of Sweden in Spa for a few days in September, and received him in Aix in October. In Paris, the Chronique de Paris reported of her departure and it was widely believed that she had gone to England for a diplomatic mission on behalf of the queen. She was long in doubt as to whether she would be in most use for the queen in or outside of France, and received conflicting advice: her friends M. de Clermont and M. de la Vaupali√®re encouraged her to return to the service of the queen, while her relatives asked her to return to Turin in Savoy. During her stay abroad, she was in correspondence with Marie Antoinette, who repeatedly asked her not to return to France. However, in October 1791, the new provisions of the Constitution came into operation, and the queen was requested to set her household in order and dismissed all office holders not in service: she accordingly wrote officially to Lamballe and formally asked her to return to service or resign. This formal letter, though it was in contrast to the private letters Marie Antoinette had written her, reportedly convinced her that it was her duty to return, and she announced that the queen wished her to return and that \\"I must live and die with her.\\" During her stay at a house that she had rented in the Royal Crescent, Bath, Great Britain the princess wrote her will, because she was convinced that she risked mortal danger should she return to Paris. Other information, however, state that the will was made in the Austrian Netherlands, being dated \\"Aix la Chapelle, to-day the 15th October 1791. Marie Th√©r√®se Louise de Savoie.\\" She left Aix la Chapelleon 20 October and her arrival in Paris was announced in the Paris newspapers of 4 November. Back in the Tuileries, Lamballe resumed her office and her work rallying supporters to the queen, investigating the loyalty of the household and writing to the noble √©migr√©es asking them to return to France in the name of the queen. In February 1792, for example, Louis Marie de Lescure was convinced to remain in France rather than emigrating after having met the queen in the apartment of Lamballe, who then informed him and his spouse Victoire de Donnissan de La Rochejaquelein of the queen's wishes that they should remain in France out of loyalty. Lamballe aroused the dislike of Mayor P√©tion, who objected to the queen attending supper in Lamballe's apartment, and widespread rumors claimed that the rooms of Lamballe at the Tuileries were the meeting place of an 'Austrian Committee' plotting to encourage the invasion of France, a second St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and the destruction of the Revolution. During the Demonstration of 20 June 1792, she was present in the company of the queen when a mob broke into the palace. Marie Antoinette immediately cried that her place was by the king's side, but Lamballe then cried: \\"No, no, Madame, your place is with your children!\\", after which a table was pulled before her to protect her from the mob. Lamballe, alongside Princess de Tarente, Madame de Tourzel, the Duchess de Maill√©, Mme de Laroche-Aymon, Marie Ang√©lique de Mackau, Ren√©e Suzanne de Soucy, Mme de Ginestous, and a few noblemen, belonged to the courtiers surrounding the queen and her children for several hours when the mob passed by the room shouting insults to Marie Antoinette. According to a witness, Marie Louise de Lamballe stood leaning by the queen's armchair to support her through the entire scene:Bertin, Georges: Madame de Lamballe, New York : G. A. S. Wieners, 1901 \\"Madame de Lamballe displayed even greater courage. Standing during the whole of that long sc√®ne, leaning upon the Queen's chair, she seemed only occupied with the dangers of that unhappy princess without regarding her own.\\" Marie Louise de Lamballe continued her services to the Queen until the attack on the palace on 10 August 1792, when she and Louise- √âlisabeth de Cro√ø de Tourzel, governess to the royal children, accompanied the Royal Family when they took refuge in the Legislative Assembly. M. de la Rochefoucauld was present during this occasion and recollected: : \\"I was in the garden, near enough to offer my arm to Madame la Princesse de Lamballe, who was the most dejected and frightened of the party; she took it. [...] Madame la Princesse de Lamballe said to me: \\"We shall never return to the Ch√¢teau.\\"' During their stay in the clerk's box at the Legislative Assembly, Lamballe became ill and had to be taken to the Feuillant convent; Marie Antoinette asked her not to return, but she nevertheless chose to return to the family as soon as she felt better. She also accompanied them from the Legislative Assembly to the Feuillant convent, and from there to the Temple. On 19 August, she, Louise-√âlisabeth de Cro√ø de Tourzel and Pauline de Tourzel were separated from the Royal Family and transferred to the La Force prison, where they were allowed to share a cell. They were removed from the Temple at the same time as two valets and three female servants, as it was decided that the family should not be allowed to keep their retainers.  Death  The murder of Lamballe A propaganda engraving of the death of Lamballe During the September Massacres, the prisons were attacked by mobs, and the prisoners were placed before hastily assembled people's tribunals, who judged and executed them summarily. Each prisoner was asked a handful of questions, after which the prisoner was either freed with the words 'Vive la nation', and permitted to leave, or sentenced to death with the words 'Conduct him to the Abbaye' or 'Let him go', after which the condemned was taken to a yard where they were immediately killed by a mob consisting of men, women and children. The massacres were opposed by the staff of the prison, who allowed many prisoners to escape, particularly women. Of about two hundred women, only two were ultimately killed in the prison. Pauline de Tourzel was smuggled out of the prison, but her mother and de Lamballe were too famous to be smuggled out. Their escape would have risked attracting too much notice. Almost all women prisoners tried before the tribunals in La Force were freed from charges. Indeed, not only the former royal governesses de Tourzel and Marie Ang√©lique de Mackau, but also five other women of the royal household: the lady-in- waiting Louise-Emmanuelle de Ch√¢tillon, Princesse de Tarente, the queen's ladies-maids Marie-√âlisabeth Thibault and Bazile, the Dauphin's nurse St Brice, Lamballe‚Äôs own lady's maid Navarre, as well as wife of the king's valet de Septeuil, where all put before the tribunals and freed of charges, as were even two male members of the royal household, the valets of the king and the dauphin, Chamilly and Hue. Lamballe was therefore to be somewhat of an exception. On 3 September, de Lamballe and de Tourzel were taken out to a courtyard with other prisoners waiting to be taken to the tribunal. She was brought before a hastily assembled tribunal which demanded she \\"take an oath to love liberty and equality and to swear hatred to the King and the Queen and to the monarchy\\".de Decker, Michel, La Princesse de Lamballe, mourir pour la Reine, chapter √âlargissez madame, p. 246, Librairie Acad√©mique Perrin, Paris, 1979, (Collection historique dirig√©e par Andr√© Castelot), She agreed to take the oath to liberty but refused to denounce the king, queen and monarchy. At this point, her trial was summarily ended with the words, \\"emmenez madame\\" (\\"Take madame away\\"). She was in the company of de Tourzel until she was called into the tribunal, and the exact wording of the summary trial is stated to have consisted of the following swift interrogation: :'Who are you?' :'Marie Th√©r√®se Louise, Princess of Savoy.' :'Your employment?' :'Superintendent of the Household to the Queen.' :'Had you any knowledge of the plots of the court on the 10th August?' :'I know not whether there were any plots on the 10th August; but I know that I had no knowledge of them.' :'Swear to Liberty and Equality, and hatred of the King and Queen.' :'Readily to the former; but I cannot to the latter: it is not in my heart.' : [Reportedly, agents of her father-in-law whispered to her to swear the oath to save her life, upon which she added:] :'I have nothing more to say; it is indifferent to me if I die a little earlier or later; I have made the sacrifice of my life.' :'Let Madame be set at liberty.' She was immediately taken to the street to a group of men who killed her within minutes.de Decker, p. 246. There are many different versions of the exact manner of her death, which attracted great attention and was used in propaganda for many years after the revolution, during which it was embellished and exaggerated. Some reports, for example, allege that she was raped, and her breasts sliced off in addition to other bodily mutilations. There is, however, nothing to indicate that she was exposed to any sexual mutilations or atrocities, which was widely alleged in the sensationalist stories surrounding her infamous death.Antoine De Baecque, Glory and Terror: Seven Deaths Under the French Revolution, Routledge, 2003 She was escorted by two guards to the door of the yard where the massacre was taking place; on her way there, the agents of her father-in- law followed and again encouraged her to swear the oath, but she appeared not to hear them. When the door was opened and she was exposed to the sight of bloody corpses in the yard, she reportedly cried 'Fi horreur!' or 'I am lost!', fell back, but was pulled out into the front of the yard by the two guards. Reportedly, the agents of her father-in-law were among the crowd, crying 'Gr√¢ce! Gr√¢ce!', but were soon silenced with the shouts of 'Death to the disguised lackeys of the Duc de Penthi√®vre!' One of the killers, who were tried years later, described her as 'a little lady dressed in white', standing for a moment alone. Reportedly, she was first struck by a man with a pike on her head, which caused her hair to fall down upon her shoulders, revealing a letter from Marie Antoinette which she had hidden in her hair; she was then wounded on the forehead, which caused her to bleed, after which she was very swiftly stabbed to death by the crowd. Treatment of remains Death of the Princess de Lamballe, by , 1908 (Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise). The treatment of her remains has also been the subject of many conflicting stories. After her death, her corpse was reportedly undressed, eviscerated and decapitated, with its head placed upon a pike. It is confirmed by several witnesses that her head was paraded through the streets on a pike and her body dragged after by a crowd of people shrieking 'La Lamballe! La Lamballe!'. This procession was witnessed by a M. de Lamotte, who purchased a strand of her hair which he later gave to her father-in-law, as well as by the brother of Laure Junot. Some reports say that the head was brought to a nearby caf√© where it was laid in front of the customers, who were asked to drink in celebration of her death. Some reports state that the head was taken to a barber in order to dress the hair to make it instantly recognizable, though this has been contested. Following this, the head was put on the pike again and paraded beneath Marie Antoinette's window at the Temple. Marie Antoinette and her family were not present in the room outside which the head was displayed at the time, and thus did not see it. However, the wife of one of the prison officials, Madame Tison, saw it and screamed, upon which the crowd, hearing a woman scream from inside the Temple, assumed it was Marie Antoinette. Those who were carrying it wished her to kiss the lips of her favourite, as it was a frequent slander that the two had been lovers, but the head was not allowed to be brought into the building. The crowd demanded to be allowed inside the Temple to show the head to Marie Antoinette in person, but the officers of the Temple managed to convince them not to break in to the prison. In her historical biography, Marie Antoinette : The Journey Antonia Fraser claims Marie Antoinette did not actually see the head of her long-time friend, but was aware of what was occurring, stating, \\"...the municipal officers had had the decency to close the shutters and the commissioners kept them away from the windows...one of these officers told the king '..they are trying to show you the head of Madame de Lamballe'...Mercifully, the Queen then fainted away\\". After this, the head and the corpse was taken by the crowd to the Palais Royal, where the Duke of Orl√©ans and his lover Marguerite Fran√ßoise de Buffon were entertaining a party of Englishmen for supper. The Duke of Orl√©ans reportedly commented 'Oh, it is Lamballe's head: I know it by the long hair. Let us sit down to supper', while Buffon cried out 'O God ! They will carry my head like that some day!' The agents of her father-in-law, who had been tasked with acquiring her remains and having them temporarily buried until they could be interred in Dreux, reportedly mixed in with the crowd in order to be able to gain possession of it. They averted the intentions of the crowd to display the remains before the home of de Lamballe and her father-in-law at the H√¥tel de Toulouse by saying that she had never lived there, but at the Tuileries or the H√¥tel Louvois. When the carrier of the head, Charlat, entered an alehouse, leaving the head outside, one agent, Pointel, took the head and had it interred at the cemetery near the Hospital of the Quinze Vingts. While the procession of the head is not questioned, the reports regarding the treatment of her body have been questioned. Five citizens of the local section in Paris, Hervelin, Quervelle, Pouquet, Ferrie, and Roussel, delivered her body (minus her head, which was still being displayed on a pike) to the authorities shortly after her death. Royalist accounts of the incident claimed her body was displayed on the street for a full day, but this is not likely, as the official protocols explicitly states that it was brought to the authorities immediately after her death. While the state of the body is not described, there is, in fact, nothing to indicate that it was disemboweled, or even undressed: the report recounts everything she had in her pockets when she died, and indicate that her headless body was brought fully dressed on a wagon to the authorities the normal way, rather than being dragged disemboweled along the street, as sensationalist stories claimed. Her body, like that of her brother-in-law Philippe √âgalit√©, was never found, which is why it is not entombed in the Orl√©ans family necropolis at Dreux.de Decker, chapter Ils sont blanchis par le malheur, p. 265.According to author Blanche Christabel Hardy, her heartbroken father-in-law finally succeeded in retrieving her corpse and had it interred in the Penthi√®vre family crypt at Dreux. According to Madame Tussaud, she was ordered to make a death mask.  In media  The princesse de Lamballe has been portrayed in several films and miniseries. Two of the more notable portrayals were by Anita Louise in W.S. Van Dyke's 1938 film Marie Antoinette and by Mary Nighy in the 2006 film Marie Antoinette directed by Sofia Coppola.

See the discussion of passive income on pages 10-11 of IRS Publication 514 Also, prior foreign personal holding provisions, 26 USC 551-558, repealed in 2004, provided a separate definition. It consists of interest, dividends, rents, royalties, gains on property producing FPHCI, and certain other items. Exceptions are provided for active rents and royalties, certain related party rents and royalties, same country income, and certain other items. For purposes of the foreign tax credit, an additional exception requires look-through of certain income received from a controlled foreign corporation. Exceptions Under the basic definition, there are exclusions and exceptions, which include: *Rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business (e.g., a car rental business). For royalties to qualify, the property must have been substantially developed by the recipient of the royalties. *Interest and dividends received from related parties organized in the same country as the recipient. *Rents and royalties received from related parties for use of property in the same country as the recipient is organized. *For 2006 through 2009, interest or dividends received from any related party.26 USC 954(c)(6), added by P.L. 109-222 section 103(a)(2), including the expiration provision, which was subsequently extended. Generally, the related party exclusions do not apply if the item in the hands of the payor must be allocated or apportioned to Subpart F income.26 USC 954(c)(3)(B). Thus, rents paid by CFC1 to CFC2 would be Subpart F income to CFC2 regardless of exceptions or exclusions if CFC1 would allocate the rental expense to Subpart F activities. Look-Through For Foreign Tax Credit purposes, certain types of income are re-characterized (looked-through) based on the character of the income underlying the payment.26 USC 904(d)(3). Dividends received from a 10% or more owned controlled foreign corporation (CFC) with respect to which the recipient is a U.S. shareholder (whether or not the controlling shareholder) are re-characterized based on the earnings and profits (E&P;) of the payor CFC. Interest, rents and royalties received from a similar CFC are recharacterized based on the type of income to which the payor must allocate and apportion the corresponding item of expense. Thus, if a Swiss corporation that has two owners, both U.S., pays its 20% owner interest of $1,000 and under allocation and apportionment principles its interest expense must be apportioned 42% to passive and 58% to general limitation income, then the interest income of that U.S. person from the Swiss corporation is $420 passive and $580 general limitation, and only the passive income constitutes FPHCI.

Biography Samuel Murray. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he apprenticed under John Notman, and opened his own office in 1867. That same year, at age 27, he won the design competition for the Philadelphia Masonic Temple, the building for which he is best remembered. In 1871, he was named architect for the Stephen Girard Estate, designing several buildings at Girard College and a complex of stores on Market Street that became Snellenburg's Department Store. As Supervising Architect for the U.S. Treasury Department, 1889‚Äì91, he was responsible for all federal construction. He designed at least sixteen federal buildings across the country that consolidated post offices, federal offices and federal courts. He returned to his native city, and served as Director of Public Works for the City of Philadelphia, 1891-95. He served as president of the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, 1879-86. His son, John T. Windrim, joined his architectural firm in 1882 (James H. Windrim & Son), and took over after the father's retirement. Windrim died in Philadelphia at age 79. Windrim designed the Smith Memorial Arch in West Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, which features a bronze bust of him by sculptor Samuel Murray.

He was best known for his escape from Auschwitz I, along with three other prisoners, all dressed as members of the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde, fully armed in a stolen SS staff car, in which they drove out the main gate\\"a universally acclaimed...

Polish Boy Scouts were among the groups targeted by the Gestapo and the Selbstschutz. They decided to leave Tczew on 12 November 1939 and attempted to get to France to join the free Polish Army. While crossing the border into Hungary they were captured by a German patrol. They were first sent to a Gestapo prison in Baligrod. They were told by the Gestapo, \\"Actually, we should shoot you, but we have for you something much more interesting.\\" They were sent to a prison in Sanok next, then to Montelupich Prison in Krak√≥w. Their last stop before Auschwitz was a prison in Wi≈õnicz.Main gate to Auschwitz I Piechowski was sent to Auschwitz as a political prisoner, a Legionsgaenger, one wishing to join Polish military formationsor \\"legions\\"abroad.Cf. Secretaries of Death: Accounts by Former Prisoners who worked in the Gestapo of Auschwitz, ed. & transl. L. Shelley, New York, Shengold Publishers, 1986, page 325. The Polish Boy Scouts were labeled a criminal organization in Occupied Poland. Piechowski was among a transport of 313 Polish deportees to Auschwitz on 20 June 1940: it was only the second transport after the initial one from Tarn√≥w. Among this Tarn√≥w group was another Pole who would escape in an SS uniform: Edward Galinski. Galinski's escape was short-lived. Piechowski received inmate number 918. He credits Kapo Otto K√ºsel (inmate number 2)one of the original 30 German deportees from Sachsenhausenwith his survival by assigning him lighter work. Piechowski was in the Leichenkommando, assigned to bringing corpses to the crematorium, including those shot at the \\"Black Wall\\" by SS-Rapportfuhrer Gerhard Arno Palitzsch. Piechowski was present when Polish priest and fellow Auschwitz prisoner Maximilian Kolbe offered to exchange places with a fellow Pole who was among a group of ten sentenced to be starved to death. The sentence was in retribution for a perceived escape attempt of a prisoner. Steyr 220, similar to car used in the escape He also had access to the list of upcoming executions, and when he checked it once he saw that his friend, Eugeniusz Bendera, was going to be executed. So both, together with a third man, devised an escape plan. On the morning of 20 June 1942, exactly two years after his arrival, Piechowski; Stanis≈Çaw Gustaw Jaster (born 1921; inmate number 6438), veteran of Invasion of Poland in rank of first lieutenant from Warsaw; J√≥zef Lempart (born 1916; inmate number 3419), a priest from Wadowice; and Bendera (born 1906; inmate number 8502), an auto mechanic from Czortk√≥w (now Chortkiv, Ukraine) escaped from Auschwitz 1. Piechowski, who had the best knowledge of the German language within the group, held command.Tomasz Soba≈Ñski, Ucieczki O≈õwiƒôcimskie, [4th ed.], Warsaw, Wydawnictwo Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej, 1980, p. 47. They left through the main Auschwitz camp through the Arbeit Macht Frei gate. They had taken a cart and passed themselves off as a Rollwagenkommando\\"haulage detail\\"a work group which consisted of between four and twelve inmates pulling a freight cart instead of horses.\\"By≈Çem Numerem: swiadectwa Z Auschwitz\\" by Kazimierz Piechowski, Eugenia Bozena Kodecka- Kaczy≈Ñska, Micha≈Ç Ziokowski, Hardcover, Wydawn. Siostr Loretanek, Bendera went to the motorpool; Piechowski, Lempart, and Jaster went to the warehouse in which the uniforms and weapons were stored. They entered via a coal bunker which Piechowski had helped fill. He had removed a bolt from the lid so it wouldn't self latch when closed. Once in the building they broke into the room containing the uniforms and weapons, arming themselves with four machine-guns and eight grenades.Laurence Rees, Auschwitz: The Nazis and \\"the Final Solution\\", London, BBC Books, 2005, page 54. Bendera arrived in a Steyr 220 sedan (saloon) car belonging to SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Paul Kreuzmann,Kazimierz Albin, List go≈Ñczy: historia mojej ucieczki z O≈õwiƒôcimia i dzia≈Çalno≈õci w konspiracji, Warsaw, Krajowa Agencja Wydawnicza, 1989, page 125. license number SS-20868.Danuta Czech, Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939‚Äì1945, London, Tauris, 1990, p. 184. As a mechanic he was often allowed to test drive cars around the camp. He entered the building and changed into SS uniform like the others. They then all entered the car: Bendera driving; Piechowski in the front passenger seat; Lempart and Jaster in the back. Bendera drove toward the main gate. Jaster carried a report that Witold Pilecki (deliberately imprisoned in Auschwitz to prepare intelligence about The Holocaust and who would not escape until 1943) had written for Armia Krajowa's headquarters. When they approached the gate they became nervous as it had not opened. Lempart hit Piechowski in the back and told him to do something. With the car stopped, he opened the door and leaned out enough for the guard to see his rank insignia and yelled at him to open the gate. The gate opened and the four drove off. After the escape Flag of the Armia Krajowa The prisoners abandoned the stolen escape vehicle in the vicinity of Mak√≥w Podhala≈Ñski, at a distance of some from the camp. Piechowski eventually made his way to Ukraine, but was unable to find refuge there due to anti-Polish sentiment. Forging documents and a false name, he returned to Poland to live in Tczew, where he had been captured. He soon found work doing manual labor on a nearby farm, where he made contact with the Home Army and took up arms against the Nazis within the units of 2nd Lt.

His parents were arrested by the Nazis in reprisal for his escape, and murdered in Auschwitz; the policy of tattooing prisoners was also allegedly introduced in response to his escape. Piechowski learned after the War from his boy-scout friend, Alfons \\"Alki\\" Kiprowski, who remained a prisoner at Auschwitz for some three more months after his escape, that a special investigative commission arrived at Auschwitz from Berlin to answerindependently of the camp's administrationthe question as to how an escape as audacious as that of Piechowski and his companions' was at all possible.Andrzej Urba≈Ñski, \\"Zuchwa≈Çy ≈õwiadek\\", Grupa Onet.pl SA, 15 February 2007. After the war he attended the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology and became an engineer, and then found work in Pomerania. He was denounced to the communist authorities for being a member of the Home Army and sentenced to 10 years in prison; he served 7. At the end of his sentence, he was 33; he reported thinking, \\"They have taken away my whole youthall my young years.\\" Thereafter he worked as an engineer for the communist government for some decades. After the democratic transition, he declined the Order of the White Eagle when Maciej P≈Ça≈ºy≈Ñski tried to award it to him, stating that \\"I do not feel that this honour is owed to me\\". In 1989 he sold land he owned near Gda≈Ñsk and travelled with his wife to various parts of the world, visiting over 60 countries. In 2006 Piechowski was named an honorary citizen of the city of Tczew with which he has had a longstanding association (as his pre-War hometown). Likewise, in 2006, Piechowski was the subject of the 56-minute-long documentary film Uciekinier (\\"Man on the Run\\") produced by Marek Tomasz Paw≈Çowski and Ma≈Çgorzata Walczak, which won several international awards. In 2009 the British singer Katy Carr released a song about Piechowski under the title \\"Kommander's Car\\"; while 2010 saw another documentary on the subject from the filmmaker Hannah Lovell, the 26-minute Kazik and the Kommander's Car.

After the war he returned to Przedb√≥rz to live with his wife (married 1930; one son), until their divorce in 1959 when he moved to Warsaw. He died some time after 1970.

His mother was deported to Auschwitz in reprisal for his escape, where she died. He left the priesthood, married, and had a daughter. He died in 1971 after being run over by a bus while crossing a street in Wadowice. * Stanis≈Çaw Gustaw Jaster, nom de guerre Hel (b. 1 January 1921): The youngest of the escapees. In Auschwitz was a member of the secret underground military organization ZOW. In Warsaw he reported to the Home Army High Command about the resistance in Auschwitz and became a personal emissary of Witold Pilecki. His parents were deported to Auschwitz in reprisal for his escape, where both died (his father, Stanis≈Çaw Jaster, b. 1892, having perished at Auschwitz on 3 December 1942; his mother, Eugenia Jaster, b. 1894, first deported to the Majdanek concentration camp, eventually perished at Auschwitz on 26 July 1943). He continued to fight against the German occupiers in the ranks of the Home Army as a member of one of its most important special-operations units, the Organizacja Specjalnych Akcji Bojowych (OsaKosa 30), but also at his own initiative taking part in engagements staged by other Home Army units, most notably participating in the successful action at the Celestyn√≥w railway junction on the night of 19 May 1943, carried out under the command of Captain Mieczys≈Çaw Kurkowski nom de guerre Mietek, whose object was to free the prisoners being transported by the Nazis from the Lublin Castle prison to the Auschwitz concentration camp by train, when he gained special distinction through an act of bravery whereby he virtually single-handedly assured a victorious outcome for the operation in which 49 prisoners were freed.Witold Biega≈Ñski, et al., Polish Resistance Movement in Poland and Abroad, 19391945, ed.

His comrades-in- arms have described him as a man \\"of enormous stature invested with extraordinary physical power\\". :: According to the account first promulgated in a 1968 book by Aleksander Kunicki, Cichy front,Aleksander Kunicki, Cichy front: ze wspomnie≈Ñ oficera wywiadu dywersyjnego dyspozycyjnych oddzia≈Ç√≥w Kedywu KG AK, Warsaw, PAX, 1968, 236 pp. (The title Cichy front (\\"The Quiet Front\\") is a borrowing from a Communist-propaganda book on the theme of Western espionage in Poland written by Lucjan Wolanowski in 1955.) Jaster was accused of collaboration with the Gestapo and executed in 1943 by members of the Home Army.Auschwitz: A New History by Laurence Rees Publisher: PublicAffairs; export ed edition (4 January 2005); , pp. 140-46. This account has since been discredited as lacking foundation in documentary evidence. What now appears to be reasonably certain is that Jaster was rearrested by the Gestapo in Warsaw on 12 July 1943, and that he perished sometime between July and September of that year.Daria Czarnecka, ‚ÄúMorderstwo pamiƒôci‚Ä¶‚Äù, in Biuletyn Informacyjny AK vol. 21, No. 9 (257), September 2011, pages 42‚Äì47 The exact circumstances of his death remain however a bone of contention. Both Bendera and Piechowski ‚Äï as well as many others who knew him personally ‚Äï made their voices heard in an effort to rehabilitate Jaster in the wake of controversy engendered by the publication of Cichy front.Daria Czarnecka, ‚ÄúMorderstwo pamiƒôci‚Ä¶‚Äù, in Biuletyn Informacyjny AK vol. 21, No. 9 (257), September 2011, p. 43 It has been pointed out that the author of the book accusing Jaster -- an intelligence officer of the Home Army during the War (see Operation Kutschera) named Aleksander Kunicki (18981986) -- had himself been subsequently accused of having collaborated with the Gestapo and sentenced to death, only to have his conviction set aside by the authorities of the Communist Poland (who instead awarded him a state pension for \\"meritorious service to the nation\\" an extraordinary outcome for an operative of the Home Army, a military arm of the Polish government in London, whose members were persecuted after the war by the Communists either with lengthy imprisonments (as in the case of Kazimierz Piechowski himself) or by death, as in the case of Witold Pilecki, Gen. Emil Fieldorf, and others). :: Kunicki's book was submitted to a closely reasoned and devastating critique by Tomasz Strzembosz in 1971, which uncovered that information had been concealed or falsified with regard to the published sources Kunicki cited in support of his claims.Tomasz Strzembosz, \\"Aleksander Kunicki, Cichy front...\\", Rocznik Warszawski, vol. 10 (1971), Warsaw, Pa≈Ñstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy for the Archiwum Pa≈Ñstwowe Warszawy i Wojew√≥dztwa Warszawskiego, 1971, pp. 381-93. In the slowly emerging consensus of opinion in the matter while the uncorroborated allegations by Kunicki presented as \\"facts\\" in Cichy front remain allegations, the book is thought nevertheless to contain an element of truth concerning Jaster's ultimate fate. It would appear that after his second arrest by the Gestapo in Warsaw on 12 July 1943, Jaster may have managed to escape again (by jumping out of a speeding Gestapo car moments after having been seized in the street, together with a high-ranking Home Army commander, Mieczys≈Çaw Kudelski nom de guerre Wiktor) a feat so unprecedented that it would have aroused suspicion among the Home Army plagued by a series of devastating setbacks which could only have been attributable to a well-placed mole, leading to the execution of Jaster. No documents relating to the case have come to light. The authors of the aforementioned award-winning 2006 documentary film about Kazimierz Piechowski, Uciekinier (\\"Man on the Run\\"), Marek Tomasz Paw≈Çowski and Ma≈Çgorzata Walczak, are currently working on a sequel, centered on Jaster. * Alfons Kiprowski (born 9 October 1921 in ≈öwiecie), Piechowski's fellow boy scout, was separately deported to Auschwitz (inmate number 801). He escaped from Auschwitz independently from Piechowski on 22 September 1942, together with two other prisoners, Piotr Jaglicz (b. 29 June 1922; inmate number unknown) and Adam Szumlak (b. 16 June 1920; inmate number E-1957 [or EH-1954]).Zeszyty o≈õwiƒôcimskie, vol. 18 (1983), page 114.Studia nad okupacjƒÖ hitlerowskƒÖ po≈Çudniowo-wschodniej czƒô≈õci Polski, ed.

Allsopp was the sixth and youngest son of Henry Allsopp, 1st Baron Hindlip and Elizabeth Tongue. Several of his brothers were active in politics. He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Taunton at a by-election in April 1887, in the place of his oldest brother, Samuel, who had succeeded to the peerage on the death of their father. He was re-elected in 1892, and stood down from Parliament at the 1895 general election. Allsopp was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of Staffordshire in 1887. He was also a Justice of the Peace (JP) in Worcestershire. He was Mayor of Worcester three times (1892, 1894 and 1909). Alfred entered the family business Samuel Allsopp & Sons, as a junior partner from 1883 to 1887. He later became chairman of the company, and oversaw its conversion into a Limited Company, and retired from the business in 1900 and then sold all his shares in the company. He was also a director of the New Grand Hotel in Birmingham, of the Yolandi Mining Corporation Limited, and of Allsopp and Partners. He was made bankrupt in June 1914, after losses at Allsopp and Partners forced him to resort to moneylenders, and discharged from bankruptcy in 1920.

There are over 1000 known members with a variety of functions. The RTX family is defined by two common features: characteristic repeats in the toxin protein sequences, and extracellular secretion by the type I secretion systems (T1SS). The name RTX (repeats in toxin) refers to the glycine and aspartate-rich repeats located at the C-terminus of the toxin proteins, which facilitate export by a dedicated T1SS encoded within the rtx operon. Structure and function RTX proteins range from 40 to over 600 kDa in size and all contain C-terminally located glycine and aspartate-rich repeat sequences of nine amino acids. The repeats contain the common sequence structure [GGXGXDX[L/I/V/W/Y/F]X], (where X represents any amino acid), but the number of repeats varies within RTX protein family members. These consensus regions function as sites for Ca2+ binding, which facilitate folding of the RTX protein following export via an ATP-mediated type 1 secretion system (T1SS). Most of the T1SS proteins are encoded within the rtx operon. The T1SS proteins form a continuous channel spanning both the inner membrane (IM) and outer membrane (OM) of the bacterial cell, preventing RTX toxin exposure to the periplasmic space (between the IM and OM). Type 1 secretion system components include: an ABC transporter (TC# 3.A.1), a membrane fusion protein (MFP; TC# 8.A.1), and an outer membrane protein (OMF; TC# 1.B.17). The OMF is often encoded outside of the rtx operon as it may have multiple functions within the cell. In Escherichia coli, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Vibrio cholerae, TolC functions as the OMP in T1SS RTX toxin export. In each case, the tolC gene is located outside the rtx operon and encodes a conserved multifunctional protein. During transport, the T1SS recognizes the C-terminal repeats of the RTX toxin, and the C-terminus is transferred first through the channel. The general rtx gene cluster encodes three protein types: the RTX toxin, an RTX activating acyltransferase, and T1SS proteins. The toxin is inactive until post-translational modification by the cis-encoded RTX toxin activator, which typically occurs within the target cell. The RTX-activating acyltransferase catalyzes the attachment of acyl-linked fatty acids to internally located lysine residues within the RTX toxin. This modification is required in all RTX toxins; however, its exact function in RTX toxicity is not understood. Members of the RTX toxin family display a large range of functions, and typically multiple functional domains. Pore-formation is the only known shared function in RTX cytotoxins, and pores are typically cation- selective allowing for an influx of Ca2+ in target cells. Members of the RTX superfamily (RTX (TC# 1.C.11); HrpZ (TC# 1.C.56) and CCT (TC# 1.C.57)) contain repeat sequences that are also found in autotransporters (e.g., 1.B.12.10.1 and 1.B.40.1.2) as well as TolA (2.C.1.2.1). These domains probably mediate protein-protein interactions.  Families  The Transporter Classification Database divides the RTX-toxin superfamily into 3 different families of homologues based on bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis: * 1.C.11 - The Pore-forming RTX Toxin (RTX-toxin) Family * 1.C.56 - The Pseudomanas syringae HrpZ Cation Channel (HrpZ) Family * 1.C.57 - The Clostridial Cytotoxin (CCT) Family RTX toxins were originally divided into hemolysins and leukotoxins. However, evidence has shown leukotoxic activity in the hemolysins, leading to reclassification of RTX toxin subgroups into two families: pore-forming leukotoxins (RTX-toxin family, 1.C.11.1.1) and the MARTX toxins (CCT family, 1.C.57.3.4) (multifunctional autoprocessing RTX toxins). MARTX toxins are much larger than RTX toxins and are exported by modified type 1 secretion systems containing an additional ABC-transporter.  The Pore-forming RTX Toxin (RTX- toxin) Family  The RTX-toxin family (TC# 1.C.11) (subfamily of RTX-toxin superfamily) is a large family of multidomain Gram-negative bacterial pore- forming exotoxins. They are secreted from the bacteria, and after processing, they insert into the membranes of animal cells. They exert both cell type- and species-specific effects (e.g., the leukotoxin of M. haemolytica interacts only with alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes of ruminants and is believed to promote bacterial proliferation by killing or incapacitating these cells). These toxins recognize protein receptors such as the Œ≤2-integrins, form pores at high concentrations, and cause cell rupture by mechanisms not well understood. Three transmembrane domains are believed to be involved in pore formation which in the E. coli HlyA protein (TC# 1.C.11.1.3) are at residues 299-319, 361-381 and 383-403. However, at low, sublytic concentrations, leukotoxin (TC# 1.C.11.1.1) causes activation of neutrophils, production of inflammatory cytokines, degranulation, generation of oxygen- derived free radicals, and morphologic changes consistent with apoptosis. The C-terminal domain of the adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT or CyaA; TC# 1.C.11.1.4) of Bordetella pertussis forms a small cation-selective channel, disrupting the permeability barrier. This channel probably delivers the N-terminal adenylate cyclase to the host cell cytoplasm. Mutations in residues in an amphipathic Œ±-helix (Glu509 and Glu516) in the pore-forming domain block adenylate cyclase translocation and modulate cation selectivity of the membrane channel. ACT does not use a protein receptor and inserts into liposomes. Phosphatidylethanolamine and cholesterol stimulate ACT insertion. ACT also promotes lipid flip-flop suggesting that ACT forms trans-bilayer nonlamellar lipid structures when it inserts into the membrane. CyaA may form two different types of pore-like structures, dependent on the orientation of the membrane potential and the pH. = Transport Reaction = The generalized transport reaction proposed for members of the RTX-toxin family is: :small molecules (in) ‚Üí small molecules (out).  Examples  RTX toxins are produced by a variety of gram-negative bacteria. RTX toxin production and rtx genes have been discovered in many bacterial genera including Escherichia, Proteus, and Bordetella. Members of the family Pasteurellaceae also produce RTX toxins. The genus Vibrio, which includes V. cholerae and V. vulnificus, produces MARTX toxins, another class of RTX proteins.  In Escherichia coli  RTX toxins have been found in numerous strains of pathogenic E. coli. The prototypical RTX toxin, Œ±-haemolysin (HlyA; TC# 1.C.11.1.3), is a common virulence factor in uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), the leading cause of urinary tract infections. The hly operon encodes the RTX toxin (HlyA), the HlyA activation protein HlyC (an acyltransferase; TC# 9.A.40.1.1), and two proteins of the T1SS machinery. The Hyl T1SS includes the ABC transporter HlyB (TC# 3.A.1.109.1), the membrane fusion protein HlyD (TC# 8.A.1.3.1), and the outer membrane protein TolC (TC# 1.B.17.1.1). While hlyB and hlyD genes are located within the hly operon, TolC is a multifunctional protein encodedd outside the hly operon. Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) also produces an RTX toxin. EHEC haemolysin (EHEC-Hly) was discovered in the EHEC serotype O157:H7. The EHEC-Hly operon contains four E. coli hly homologs: EHEC-hlyA, EHEC-hlyC, EHEC-hlyB, and EHEC-hlyD. Shiga toxins (Stx) are the primary virulence factors in enterohaemorrhagic E. coli but EHEC produces several other virulence factors capable of damaging the vascular endothelium in EHEC infections. EHEC- Hly is expressed in numerous EHEC serogroups known to cause severe infections in humans. EHEC-Hly is transported within EHEC-secreted outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in vitro. This mode of transport increases virulence by aiding in EHEC-Hly delivery to target cells.  In Vibrio cholerae  RTX toxins in Vibrio bacteria represent an early discovery in RTX toxin research, but were only recently discovered to belong to a separate class of RTX toxins called MARTX toxins. In Vibrio cholerae the martx gene encodes six proteins: the MARTX toxin (RtxA), an acyltransferase (RtxC), a membrane fusion protein (RtxD), two ABC-transporters (RtxB and RtxE), and one protein with unknown function. RtxA is a virulence factor involved in cholera which facilitates colonization of V. cholerae the small intestine. RtxA causes destruction of the actin cytoskeleton in host cells through G-actin modification and destruction of Rho GTPases. The toxin contains four functional domains: an actin cross-linking domain (ACD), a Rho-inactivating domain (RID), a cysteine protease domain (CPD), and an Œ±Œ≤-hydrolase. In V. cholerae infection, the CPD binds to inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6, Phytic acid) inside eukaryotic host cells. This binding activates the autoproteolytic CPD which cleaves the MARTX protein into smaller independent proteins each containing only one of the effector domains ACD, RID, and Œ±Œ≤-hydrolase. This allows each effector to act independently within the host cell, this increases the effects of RtxA because the ACD and RID function in different locations within the cell. ACD cross- links monomeric G-actin in the host cell cytosol, preventing formation of actin microfilament, a major component of the cytoskeleton. RID inactivates membrane bound Rho-GTPases, which are regulators of cytoskeleton formation. In Bordetella pertussis Adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT or CyaA), is a primary virulence factor in Bordetella pertussis. CyaA is a multifunctional RTX family toxin that targets myeloid phagocytes, impairing the innate immune response and promoting B. pertussis colonization. The cyaA operon encodes the five proteins CyaA (RTX toxin), CyaC (CyaA activation protein), and the three T1SS proteins: CyaB (an ABC transporter) CyaD (a membrane fusion protein), and CyaE (an outer membrane protein). The CyaA protein contains an adenylate cyclase domain (AC domain) and a hemolytic/cytolytic domain. The hemolytic function forms pores in target cells, while the cytolytic function increases intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP. In host cells expressing the CD11b/CD18 integrin receptor (macrophage-1 antigen, Œ±MŒ≤2 integrin), CyaA binds the Œ±MŒ≤2 integrin and inserts itself into the cell membrane and initiates an influx of Ca2+. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ allows for the repositioning of the CyaA toxin within the cell cytosol. Once the AC domain is activated through calmodulin binding, it begins to convert cytosolic ATP to cAMP, raising it to cytotoxic levels.

He served as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) from 1987 until 1992. A graduate of RAAF College, he began his career flying CAC Sabre jet fighters in Australia and South East Asia in the 1950s and 1960s. From 1972 to 1975 he commanded No. 6 Squadron, during which time the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber entered Australian service. He held senior staff posts in the early 1980s. In 1986, he was promoted to air marshal and became the inaugural Vice Chief of the Defence Force. Appointed CAS in July 1987, Funnell was closely involved in the development and dissemination of air power doctrine. He retired from the RAAF in October 1992 following his term as CAS, and was founding Principal of the Australian College of Defence and Strategic Studies from 1994 to 1998. Since then he has served on various Federal Government committees on immigration and detention.

As a flight lieutenant in the early 1960s, he instructed on the de Havilland Vampire with No. 1 Applied Flying Training School at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 155 In 1966 he served as commanding officer of No. 79 Squadron at Ubon. Squadron Leader Funnell attended RAAF Staff College, Canberra, from January to December 1967.Hurst, Strategy and Red Ink, p. 191 He subsequently served in various staff positions with the RAAF and on exchange with the United States Air Force. In 1971 he became the first RAAF officer to attend the US Air War College, and received a master's degree in political science from Auburn University. Promoted to wing commander, from 1972 to 1975 he was commanding officer of No. 6 Squadron at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. His tenure witnessed the introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber to Australian service. On 8/9 April 1974, Funnell flew an F-111 around Australia to commemorate the 1924 circumnavigation of the continent by Wing Commander Stanley Goble and Flight Lieutenant Ivor McIntyre in a Fairey III seaplane.Lax, From Controversy to Cutting Edge, pp. 108‚Äì109, 128‚Äì129 From 1975 to 1978 he was head of the Military Planning Staff for the Australian Defence Force Academy project. He also served as honorary aide-de-camp to Governor- General Sir John Kerr. Funnell was awarded the National Medal for long service in 1977, and a clasp the following year. Senior command Promoted to air commodore, Funnell was appointed Chief of Staff at Headquarters Operational Command in Glenbrook, New South Wales, in 1979. He attended the Royal College of Defence Studies, London, in 1981 and the following year was appointed Director-General of the Military Staff Branch in the Department of Defence, Canberra. In November 1983 he was promoted air vice marshal and became Chief of Air Force Operations and Plans. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) on 10 June 1985. The same year, he took up the position of Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Policy). On 6 June 1986, he was promoted to air marshal and appointed the first Vice Chief of the Defence Force; the role made him responsible for Australian Defence Force policy and planning, as well as operations. On 3 July 1987, Funnell succeeded Air Marshal Jake Newham as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), becoming the first graduate of RAAF College to attain the position; he was also the first incumbent to possess a master's degree.Stephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, vStephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, p. 25 Known for his intellectual curiosity and commitment to the study of air warfare, Funnell ordered the establishment in 1989 of a permanent think-tank and educational institution, the Air Power Studies Centre (later the Air Power Development Centre), and donated the R.G. Funnell library to RAAF Staff College.Hurst, Strategy and Red Ink, pp. 100, 107 The Air Power Manual, the RAAF's first self-produced treatise on aerial war fighting, was completed by a development team sponsored by Funnell, and published in 1990.Pickard, Air Power Doctrine Education, p. 6 Funnell also championed the publication of The Decisive Factor, based on the writings of Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley, who was credited with laying the foundations for the RAAF's modern air power doctrine.Stephens, Isaacs, High Fliers, pp. 38‚Äì39Stephens; O'Loghlin, The Decisive Factor, xi As CAS, Funnell focused on turning the RAAF into the \\"air power element of a cohesive, integrated defence force\\".Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 311-312 His tenure saw the continuation of a shift in the RAAF's 'centre of gravity' from the south to the north of Australia. RAAF Base Curtin, in North Western Australia, and RAAF Base Tindal, in the Northern Territory, were opened and development proceeded on RAAF Base Scherger in Far North Queensland. At the same time, bases in the south, including Point Cook, Laverton and support units in capital cities, were rationalised.Stephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, pp. 90‚Äì91Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 299-300 The Air Force was in the process of re- equipping its Mirage III fighter squadrons with the F/A-18 Hornet when Funnell became CAS, and he had to contend with a shortage of pilots that was exacerbated by the extra training time required for the new aircraft. In September 1988, he flew one of the RAAF's recently acquired Pilatus PC-9 turboprop trainers in the Bicentenary Round Australia Air Race. He considered it fitting that the CAS should make the journey, as Stanley Goble had held the same position when he circumnavigated Australia for the first time in 1924. His term coincided with the 1990‚Äì91 Gulf War; the RAAF's contribution included transporting Australian hostages and medical staff from the Middle East. Funnell was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) on 12 June 1989 for his service as CAS, and awarded the US Commander of the Legion of Merit in 1991. Later life Funnell retired from the RAAF following completion of his term as CAS on 1 October 1992, and was succeeded by Air Marshal Barry Gration, one of his classmates from the 1953 intake at RAAF College.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 128 Funnell's five-year term as CAS was the longest since that of Air Marshal George Jones, who served ten years in the post from 1942 to 1952.Stephens, Australia's Air Chiefs, p. 30 In 1993, Funnell became Director of the National Defence College project. From 1994 until 1998, he served as the inaugural Principal of the Australian College of Defence and Strategic Studies, which subsequently evolved into the Australian Defence College. He became a consultant in 1999, and was awarded the Centenary Medal for \\"humanitarian and defence services\\" on 1 January 2001.

Fankhauser began his professional studies at Purdue in 1957 where he studied engineering. He entered the music program at Southwestern College in his native Kansas in the Fall of 1958 and transferred after two years to the Oberlin Conservatory of Music where he obtained a Bachelor of Music in 1962. He was awarded a Fulbright Grant which enabled him to pursue graduate studies in vocal performance in London at the Royal Academy of Music and choral conducting with Sir David Lumsden at New College, University of Oxford in 1962-1963. In 1972 he received a Rockefeller Fellowship to study with Maestro John Nelson at the Aspen Choral Institute as a Conducting Fellow. He was then appointed Nelson's Assistant Director of the Institute for the next summer, during which he conducted concerts in a Bach Cantata Series In 1973 he was appointed the music director of the Vancouver Cantata Singers (VCS), remaining in that position until 2000. Under his leadership the VCS won several notable music competitions, including the BBC International Choral Competition and the CBC National Radio Competition. He has made several recording with VCS, one of which was nominated for a Juno Award in 1994. The choir has also appeared numerous times on Canadian television and radio under his direction. In 1981 the choir won the BBC's International Choral Competition, \\"Let the people sing,\\" winning the Israeli Silver Cup for best performance. The Cantata Singers made three professional CDs over the years: Venetian Vespers of 1640 (Antonio Rigatti), Skylark Records; A 1640 Venetian Mass (Rigatti), an Analekta fleurs de lys recording; and Abendlied, a Carus-Verlag recording featuring Josef Rheinberger choral music including his Abendlied. The Venetian Vespers of 1640 won the Association of Canadian Choral Conductor's 1994 National Choral Award: Outstanding Choral Recording. Fankhauser returned to the United States to attend the University of California, Berkeley where he studied musicology from 1963-1966. After the first year he was appointed Director of the UC men's Glee Club and women's Treble Clef, touring yearly throughout California. He sang several tenor roles in the Berkeley production and professional recording of Monteverdi's opera, L'Incoronazione di Poppea. Graduating in 1966 with an M.A. in musicology, he received the Eisner Prize for outstanding musical talent. In the summer of 1964 he studied voice on a scholarship at the Tanglewood Music Center where he gained the opportunity to perform as a soloist at the Tanglewood Music Festival. In 1966 Fankhauser joined the faculty as a sabbatical replacement for Professor Iva Dee Hiatt at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts where he conducted choirs and taught voice during the 1966-1967 school year. He accepted a job at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York where he taught music theory and conducted the university's choirs from 1967-1973. During this period a great performance of the Mozart Vespers K. 339 under his baton (with the famous Paul Kuentz orchestra) was recorded and issued on a now very rare lp. He left there to join the voice and choral conducting faculty at the University of British Columbia where he remained until 2000. He directed the UBC University Singers for many years during which time the group won several singing competitions, including the CBC National Radio Competition in 1994, which led to the BBC's International Radio Competition at which they were out-sung by the Norwegians. But in 1995 they went to the prestigious International Chamber Choir Competition Marktoberdorf, where they won First Prize against choirs from many countries in Europe and Asia. Fankhauser served as the director of the Manitoba Youth Choir Camp in 1983. He was principal conductor for the Saskatchewan Sings in 1987. He has also worked actively as a clinician for choirs in Canada and has led masterclasses and workshops in conducting in Alberta and British Columbia. Interestingly, Fankhauser stated in 2018: \\"When I graduated from college during the Vietnam war and was granted a Fulbright scholarship to study music at Oxford University, my ignorant, small town draft board refused to let me go. I asked for a reconsideration by the state draft board, which also refused. I had one more place to appeal the decision: the President of the United States. I did so, and John F. Kennedy agreed with me. I did study at Oxford and went on to win national and international competitions with my choirs from the three universities at which I taught during my career.

In 1872 he went to Bolivia to work in the Tocopilla Copper Mines and in 1875, moved to Iquique, which was then in Peru, and became involved in the production of saltpetre. During the War of the Pacific, Harvey was captured at the Battle of San Francisco. Due to his expertise in the nitrate industry, he was recruited to work for the Chilean government. About this time he married Alida Mar√≠a Godefroy who was from a respected Franco-Peruvian family. In 1881, when the Chilean government privatized the nitrate industry, Harvey became managing partner for the firm of J. T. North and Harvey, which he had established with John Thomas North, who was often called the Nitrate King. By 1883, Harvey had made enough money he decided it was time to return to Britain where he became a landowner in Cornwall and Devon. He bought the Trenoweth estate, near Grampound Road and many properties in the Totnes area including Dundridge House in the parish of Harberton. In 1897, he was High Sheriff of Devon and in 1900 Sheriff of Cornwall, and he made an unsuccessful run to become MP for Truro.

For instance, using a display and a rear projector system a person could create images that look three-dimensional and appear to float in midair. Some systems utilize an optical head-mounted display to augment the virtual objects onto the transparent display utilizing sensors to determine visual and physical interactions with the virtual objects projected. History *2010, Displair introduced its first commercial \\"screenless\\" 3D virtual multi-touch display, consisting of cold stable air flow containing particles of water produced by a cavitation method. *Late 2010, Microsoft released the Kinect, a first of a kind commercially available and affordable virtual touch screen sensor that could track a person's movement and augment their interactions with objects rendered in a television set. *2015, Microsoft unveiled the Hololens, an optical head-mounted display utilizing the Windows Holographic platform. Virtual objects are displayed through the optical head-mounted to render the Windows 10 system onto the visible environment of the user. Development During a 2009 study at the Korea Electronics Technology Institute, a virtual touch screen system was built using the touch point tracking technique based on a time of flight camera with a Kalman filter. To address the widespread problem in conventional virtual touch screen systems (i.e. responding sensitively to even the slightest hand movement and failing to recognize the touch point accurately), the study had applied the Kalman filter tracking technique to predict and track the touch point consecutively. Being forecast and recognized, the predicted touch point was bound to exist all the time, but an abrupt movement of touch point was likely to be recognized only insensitively. A commercial version based on this technology was never implemented. Usage Currently, virtual touch screens (VTS) are used primarily for entertainment and research purposes. A popular virtual touch screen system is the Kinect system made commercially available by Microsoft. The Kinect system is primarily used for consumer entertainment such as playing games and using the menus found on the Xbox system.Microsoft's new Kinect is official: larger field of view, HD camera, wake with voice However, in recent years the Kinect has been used for research projects in the field of robotics and 3-D interactions outside of the field of games such as browsing the web, and medical practices. There is a potential for the technology where the 3D visualization and physical interaction with the objects is necessary, such as teaching students introductory calculus. Virtual touch screen technology can also be applied to turn non-touch displays into interactive, touch-capable surfaces using a Kinect sensor in combination with a projector. This type of application allows virtual touch technology to enhance personal display usage as well as better communication and presentation of data to be used in education or business settings. The Kinect sensor, commonly used in many virtual touch screen applications In medical practices, virtual touch interaction has been applied to allow users to view and manipulate digital data such as 3D images used in medical scans, allowing medical staff to interact with the data without any physical contact, thus avoiding the need for re-sterilization. Additionally, Microsoft's Kinect sensor has also employed the use of virtual touch screen technology to help stroke patients recover and improve motor function in their limbs through a game-like system involving interpretation of gestures combined with adjustable difficulty levels based on the user's performance. Human factors and ergonomics One of the key issues with virtual environments that utilize touch are the haptics. For example, utilizing virtual touch screen for medical training could cut costs down for training medical staff for touch delicate operations such as surgery. However, the haptics of such training does not provide sufficient physical touch feedback necessary for a virtually trained practitioner to perform a real surgery. Incorporating sufficient haptic feedback to virtual touch screen interactions is an active area of research.

He sat in the House of Commons for all but one of the years from 1922 to 1935.  Early life  Harvey was born in Cornwall to Sir Robert Harvey, a Cornish businessman who had struck it rich in the nitrate business in Chile, and Robert's wife Alida Marie Godefroy, a Franco-Peruvian lady whom Robert had married while working in Iquique during the time of the War of the Pacific and the transfer of that area from Peruvian to Chilean control. He was educated at Eton until 1902, and in 1905 he joined the 1st King's Dragoon Guards. He was with the regiment in India when World War I began. The Dragoon Guards arrived in to France in November 1914, and soon mounted a cavalry charge, one of the few in that war. The unit was gassed and Harvey's health never recovered.  Career  Harvey was elected at 1922 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Totnes, after the retirement of the long-serving MP Francis Mildmay. He was narrowly defeated at the 1923 general election by the Liberal Party candidate Henry Harvey Vivian, but ousted Vivian at the 1924 general election and held the seat until he retired from the Commons at the 1935 general election. It was announced in the 1935 New Year Honours list that Harvey was to be knighted, \\"for political and public services\\". The title was conferred at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace on 21 February 1935. After leaving the Commons he lived in Sidmouth in Devon, becoming a Justice of the Peace (JP) and in 1938 a Deputy Lieutenant of Devon. 1941 Harvey was the High Sheriff of Devon.

A noted Talmudic scholar, both in the traditional and academic sense, he is credited with delineating a methodology for a critical textual based study of Talmud. Biography Weiss was born in Podhajce, Galicia, where he received a traditional Jewish education. In 1916 he was given ordination from David Horowitz, the Rabbi of Stanislaw, and the following year Weiss entered the University of Vienna. In 1921 he completed a Ph.D. in History and Classical Philology, the topic of the dissertation being, \\"The Relationship of the Popes to the Jews During the Middle Ages\\". Throughout this period Weiss continued his Talmudic studies under the guidance of Rabbi Aptowitzer, from whom he received an additional certificate of ordination in 1922. In 1928 Weiss was invited to serve as Docent for Talmud at the Institute for Jewish Science in Warsaw, Poland. During his time there Weiss was tremendously involved in Zionist activities and Jewish communal affairs. Most notably, Weiss served as vice president of the Mizrachi Organization of Poland (1935‚Äì1940), and was appointed to the Jewish Committee (judenrat) of Warsaw. It was in this latter capacity that Weiss helped delay the implementation of the creation of the Warsaw ghetto. In 1940 Weiss was offered a position at Yeshiva University of Professor of Talmud. He accepted and traveled to the United States with his family, escaping the Nazi Holocaust. He remained at Yeshiva University for over a quarter of a century, with positions within both the undergraduate university and the Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies. In 1967, Weiss retired from his post at Yeshiva University and moved to Israel. In Israel, Weiss lectured at Bar-Ilan University until his death in 1970.296.819.04 F312- Abraham Weiss Bio His sons are Dr. Moshe Weiss and Prof. Benjamin Weiss. Thoughts Weiss' research focused on a critical study of the Babylonian Talmud. While previous investigators of the history of the Talmud predominantly sought their information from external sources, Weiss believed that any study of Talmud requires an extensive textual analysis in addition to a conceptual analysis; a method that was later coined the \\"inside-outside approach\\". He began with an analysis of the use of terms that indicate a quotation of sources, then moved on to later and earlier elements within Talmudic discussion, and into their significance for chapters, tractates, and for the Talmud as a literary entity. One of Weiss' conclusions is the opinion that the Talmud was a continuous process from the time of the Amora'im until the time of the Geonim. This was a break from the previously held notion that the final editing of the Talmud occurred at the hands of Ravina and Rav Ashi, two late Amora'im. His studies on the Babylonian Talmud's evolution and the Saboraic and early Gaonic activities opened many new avenues in the development of Talmud and in the interpretation of Talmudic law.BM42.W4 S38-Sefer ha-yovel li-khevod ha-Rav Dr. Avraham ·πæai Compared to the Babylonian Talmud, the Jerusalem Talmud is generally seen as an unclear and difficult to understand. Weiss argued that rather than the Jerusalem Talmud being a corrupted version of an original clear text, it is the unchanged version of the original text, whereas the Babylonian Talmud (which originally resembled the Jerusalem Talmud in level of clarity, he argued) was edited by later generations to add explanations, connective passages, and source citations.Jubilee Volume, 33 Weiss argued that rather than there originally being \\"one [Babylonian] Talmud\\", there were \\"many Talmuds\\", as every academy produced its own Talmud covering specific tractates, and our Babylonian Talmud is mostly derived from the Talmud of the academy of Pumbeditha.Jubilee Volume, 38 He argues that the Pumbeditha academy never produced Talmud on the Mishnaic orders of Zeraim and Taharot, so no \\"Babylonian Talmud\\" on those subjects ever existed, while occasional Talmud material on those subjects which is quoted elsewhere in the Babylonian Talmud is taken from the Talmuds of other academies.Jubilee Volume, 42 Weiss saw evidence of textual development in the Mishna similar to that in the Talmud. For example, in Mishna Shabbat 4:1-3 he discerns three levels: an early anonymous mishna; additions from early Tannaim (around or before the destruction of the Temple); additions from late Tannaim (after the Bar Kochba revolt).Jubilee Volume, 63 Regarding other Tannaitic halachic works (Tosefta and halachic midrashim), which the Talmud sometimes quotes but sometimes decides halacha in contradiction to - Weiss argued that different passages (sugyot) in the Talmud were composed by different authors, some of whom had access to the Tosefta or midrashim, some of whom did not.Jubilee Volume, 71 Publications *Le-korot Hithavvut Ha-Bavli (1929) Warsaw *Ha-Talmud Bavli Bi-Hithavvuto Ha-Siferutit vol.

Biography  He was born in the seaside barrio of Ca√±amelar and was apparently the son of a fisherman, so he was given the nickname \\"El Pescadoret\\"; although this has been brought into question by later research. In 1771, at the age of eleven, he entered the Real Academia de San Carlos and studied there until 1775.Biographical notes @ the Museo del Prado. When he turned 19, he spent almost two years fighting the Barbary Pirates along the coast of North Africa until he had to return to Spain because an illness had left him deaf. Biographical notes @ EPdLP. Later, he moved to Madrid, where he worked with Mariano Salvador Maella and was briefly introduced to Goya. In 1783, he became a teacher at the Escuela Real de la Merced, a satellite school of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, and applied to continue his studies at the Academia. (In 1818, he became Director of the Escuela.) The Castaway, once attributed to Goya Little more is known of personal life at that time, except that, in 1790, he was living in his old neighborhood in Valencia, near the home of the Marqu√©s de La Romana, to whom he had offered his services, and where Goya had come to recover from a spell of ill health. According to a letter from Goya to his friend Mart√≠n Zapater, this is where they first became acquainted when Juli√† sought Goya's recommendation as a mutual friend of Maella. At this time, Goya was beginning to suffer from deafness, so this may have helped form a sympathetic bond between them. In 1798, Goya received a major commission to create frescoes in the Royal Chapel of St. Anthony of La Florida, but his health continued to be unstable and he sometimes employed Juli√† as an assistant. A portrait by Goya indicates that the two were in contact until at least 1814. Apparently, he was a man of little ambition; satisfied with whatever orders he received from the local bourgeoisie. The number of his confirmed paintings is rather small; mostly of a military or allegorical nature. His painting, The Castaway (also called The Smuggler) was attributed to Goya until the early twentieth century; complicated by the fact that he was known to have made copies of Goya's works. Some of his paintings were made into engravings by Rafael Esteve, who had also worked with Goya. Apparently, he was never married and had no children. Online sources give his birth year as early as 1746, or as late as 1767. His place of death is generally given as Madrid, although this is not firmly established. A few sources give his year of death as 1816. In 2008, , Chief Curator at the Museo del Prado issued a press release asserting that The Colossus, an iconic work by Goya, was actually the work of Juli√†. After a year's worth of international controversy, the issue was decided in favor of Goya.

The busy Pacific Highway passes nearby. New Italy is 693 km north-east of the state capital, Sydney, and 12 km south of Woodburn. New Italy is part of the Richmond Valley Shire, the administrative headquarters of which is in nearby Casino. History In 1882 Italian immigrants from the region of Veneto in northern Italy, most of them survivors of the ill-fated De Rays Expedition, took up a conditional purchase farm of near Woodburn at what was initially called C√®a Venessia (Little Venice) and later renamed New Italy. By the mid-1880s, about 50 holdings of an aggregate area of more than 3,000 acres (12 km¬≤) were under occupation, and the Italian population of New Italy had increased to 250. It was a small farming community growing fruits and vegetables including grape vines. The school was opened in 1885 but ceased operation in 1933 due to decreasing enrolments. The New Italy settlers built mud brick houses, a church, school and community hall in traditional style of northern Italy. Due to its remote location the population of settlements was stagnant. In the 1930s a Park of Peace was established to remember the pioneers of the settlement. In the late 1950s the regional significance of the settlement began to be recognised. The Bicentennial Museum was opened in 1989. Following the World Expo in Brisbane in 1988 the Italian government presented the contents of their Expo Pavilion to the New Italy Centenary Committee and the Italian Pavilion at New Italy was opened in May 1993. The Museum presents the history of Italian migration to Australia and the memorabilia from the New Italy settlement. The Pavilion celebrates all Italian migrants and their contribution to the culture of Australia.

The film uses a non-linear narrative style, using history to frame a tale of lost love and redemption spanning close to three decades, starting in 1981 with the tragic accident in the construction of the Manila Film Center, through to the 1986 People Power Revolution, which ended the 21-year Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, and finally concluding in 2009, which finds the major characters of the film facing the consequences of the theft of one of 3,000 pairs of shoes of the First Lady Imelda Marcos. The film won the Special Jury Prize in the 2010 Bogota International Film Festival. It participated in the 2010 Vietnam International Film Festival in Hanoi and the 2010 China Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival. The film was rated \\"A\\" by the Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines and was also cited as Best Picture in the 2010 Catholic Mass Media Awards in the Philippines. Plot On the last day of the People Power Revolution in the Philippines in February 1986, 10-year-old Lucas Munozca (Marvin Agustin) finds himself swept up with a euphoric crowd that has entered the grounds of the Malaca√±ang Presidential Palace. Lost in the tumult, Lucas stumbles into a room where the president's wife, Imelda Marcos, kept her infamous shoe collection. He plans to filch two pairs but only manages to steal one pair‚Äîfor poetic justice and for love. Lucas gives the pair of red shoes from the country's First Lady to the first ladies of his life. The right shoe he gives to his mother, Chat (Liza Lorena), who ekes out a living giving manicures and pedicures while seemingly unable to recover from the loss of her husband, Domingo (Tirso Cruz III), the father of her only son, who was among the 169 workers said to have been buried alive when the upper levels of the Manila Film Center collapsed under construction in 1981 for the Manila International Film Festival project of the First Lady. The left shoe Lucas gifts to the love of his life, Bettina (Nikki Gil), the daughter of one of her mother's wealthy manicure home service customers. Lucas and Bettina eventually become a couple years later and go steady for 13 years until a betrayal ends the relationship. At this point, the red shoes again become crucial for both mother and son in their attempt to overcome their respective loneliness: Chat, in trying to contact her husband from beyond the grave through Madame Vange (Tessie Tomas), a spiritist whose main job is being an Imelda impersonator; and Lucas, in trying to redeem himself for having lost his true love in a moment of weakness.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers were unable to finish the entry on time so they decided to pull out. Marvin Agustin liked the story so much that he called writer James Ladioray to present to Unitel President and CEO Tony Gloria, who was drawn to the story and greenlighted the project. Jorolan, a TV commercial director, faced other challenges. Lead stars Agustin and Gil, contract actors from rival TV stations GMA Network and ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, had to squeeze in shooting in their competing work schedules, stretching principal photography, which took only 20 days, over 10 months. Jorolan and Ladioray, an advertising creative director, had to shuttle in between their regular work and the movie set to complete the shoot. Ladioray adds, \\"I didn't want to make an outrightly political movie. That part in our history was very decisive, I wanted to make a story that can use that turning point as a point of redemption for everyone. The shoes are a metaphor ‚Äî I wanted to ask the question, would you steal for love?\\" Jorolan speaks of another metaphor that was crucial to the story, the bridge. \\"A bridge connotes relationship, whether it's been cut short, it still holds its purpose, similar to a relationship that's been broken off. (It still holds significance).\\" Awards and recognition *27th Bogota International Film Festival, 2010: Special Jury Recognition Award (Mencion de Honor) *32nd Catholic Mass Media Awards Philippines, 2010 : Best Picture *1st Vietnam International Film Festival, 2010: Official Selection and Best Actress Nomination *19th China Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival, 2010 : Exhibition *Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines, 2010 : Rated \\"A\\" *27th Philippine Movie Press Club Star Awards for Movies, 2011 : Nominations for the Digital Movie Category - Best Movie, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematographer, Best Musical Scorer, Best Sound Engineer, Best Original Movie Theme Song for \\"Bawa't Hakbang\\" *29th Luna Awards by the Film Academy of the Philippines, 2011 : Nomination for Best Sound ReferencesExternal links *Official website  * Imeldific in a Good Way - Manila Times Review * Love in the Form of 8 Stilettos * The Tale of Imelda's Stolen Pair of Red Shoes *The Red Shoes -- A Story of Love and Hope Thepoc.net Review *If the red shoes fit Telebisyon.net *Big steps for 'The Red Shoes' Telebisyon.net *PEP REVIEW: The Red Shoes unearths the Imelda Marcos in all of us Pep.ph Review *Marvin Agustin and Nikki Gil search for the perfect fit in The Red Shoes * The Red Shoes Wins Big in South America Filmfest * Pinoy Film Honored in Bogota * Colombia Honors RP Film * Best Picture 2010 CMMA * 27th PMPC Star Awards Nominations for The Red Shoes * The Red Shoes 29th Luna Awards Nomination for Best Sound Category:2010 films Category:Philippine films Category:Filipino- language films Category:Philippine romance films ","title":"The Red Shoes (2010 film)"},{"id":"26523072","text":"Michael Bauer (born August 14, 1980) is an American former professional basketball player.

Ecological farming includes all methods, including organic, which regenerate ecosystem services like: prevention of soil erosion, water infiltration and retention, carbon sequestration in the form of humus, and increased biodiversity. Many techniques are used including no till, multispecies cover crops, strip cropping, terrace cultivation, shelter belts, pasture cropping etc. Benefits Ecological farming involves the introduction of symbiotic species, where possible, to support the ecological sustainability of the farm. Associated benefits include a reduction in ecological debt and elimination of dead zones.Scientific American report on dead zones in the sea Ecological farming is a pioneering, practical development which aims to create globally sustainable land management systems, and encourages review of the importance of maintaining biodiversity in food production and farming end products.Nature report on traditional farming ecological debt One foreseeable option is to develop specialized automata to scan and respond to soil and plant situations relative to intensive care for the soil and the plants. Accordingly, conversion to ecological farming may best utilize the information age, and become recognised as a primary user of robotics and expert systems.BBC Report Challenges The challenge for ecological farming science is to be able to achieve a mainstream productive food system that is sustainable or even regenerative. To enter the field of ecological farming, location relative to the consumer, can reduce the food miles factor to help minimise damage to the biosphere by combustion engine emissions involved in current food transportation. Design of the ecological farm is initially constrained by the same limitations as conventional farming: local climate, the soil's physical properties, budget for beneficial soil supplements, manpower and available automatons; however long-term water management by ecological farming methods is likely to conserve and increase water availability for the location, and require far fewer inputs to maintain fertility. Principles Certain principles unique to ecological farming need to be considered. *Food production should be ecological in both origin and destinyHere, the term destiny refers to the post-harvest ecological footprint which results in getting produce to the consumer. *Integration of species that maintain ecosystem services whilst providing a selection of alternative productsFAS Recommendations *Minimise food miles, packaging, energy consumption and waste. *Define a new ecosystem to suit human needs using lessons from existing ecosystems from around the worldFertiliser treesNutrient dense food speciesDeep rooted trees maintain water balance *Apply the value of a knowledge-base (advanced data base) about soil microorganisms so that discoveries of the ecological benefits of having various kinds of microorganisms encouraged in productive systems such as Forest Gardens can be assessed and optimised; for example in the case of naturally occurring microorganisms called denitrifiers See also *Forest farming *Holistic management *Natural farming *Permaculture *Rainwater harvesting in Canada NotesReferences Category:Sustainable agriculture ","title":"Ecological farming"},{"id":"26523084","text":"Dominic Arizona Bonuccelli is a professional photographer, television host and world traveler.

Early life Crowe became interested in aviation early on, serving as secretary of the school aviation club at St. Helen's School. Although he was born in Ireland, he was educated in England, at Colwyn Bay and at Cheltenham School in 1911. He returned to Ireland in 1913 for further schooling, attending Trinity College, Dublin as an engineering student. While there, he joined the Officers Training Corps.

Aviation On 5 September 1917, he was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps as an Observer. He applied for pilot's training at this time, but was refused because of a shortage of observers. He was assigned to No. 20 Squadron RFC in November, and underwent training beginning 28 November 1917. On 23 January 1918, he was officially assigned to 20 Squadron as a Flying Officer Observer, although he had already jumped the gun and scored his first three victories by then. On 1 April 1918, he was shot down by antiaircraft fire, in a crash that totally destroyed his Bristol F.2 Fighter, but escaped unharmed. On 12 April 1918, he and Douglas Graham Cooke returned from a special mission with their Bristol F.2 Fighter bullet riddled; again, he was unhurt.

As the war lasted for nearly the entire existence of the Confederacy, military considerations dominated national finance. Early in the war the Confederacy relied mostly on tariffs on imports and on taxes on exports to raise revenues. However, with the imposition of a voluntary self- embargo in 1861 (intended to \\"starve\\" Europe of cotton and force diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy), as well as the blockade of Southern ports, declared in April 1861 and enforced by the Union Navy, the revenue from taxes on international trade declined. Likewise, the financing obtained through early voluntary donations of coins and bullion from private individuals in support of the Confederate cause, which early on proved quite substantial, dried up by the end of 1861. As a result, the Confederate government had to resort to other means of financing its military operations. A \\"war-tax\\" was enacted but proved difficult to collect. Likewise, the appropriation of Union property in the South and the forced repudiation of debts owned by Southerners to Northerners failed to raise substantial revenue. The subsequent issuance of government debt and substantial printing of the Confederate dollars contributed to high inflation, which plagued the Confederacy until the end of the war. Military setbacks in the field also played a role by causing loss of confidence and by fueling inflationary expectations.Burdekin and Langdana, pp. 352‚Äì362 At the beginning of the war, the Confederate dollar cost 90¬¢ worth of gold (Union) dollars. By the war's end, its price had dropped to .017¬¢.Neal, p. xxiii Overall, prices in the South increased by more than 9000% during the war.Weidenmier The Secretary of the Treasury of the Confederate States, Christopher Memminger (in office 1861-1864), was keenly aware of the economic problems posed by inflation and loss of confidence. However, political considerations limited internal taxation ability, and as long as the voluntary embargo and the Union blockade remained in place, it was impossible to find adequate alternative sources of finance. Tax finance Christopher Memminger (1803‚Äì1888), the first Secretary of Treasury of the Confederate States of America The South financed a much lower proportion of its expenditures through direct taxes than the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. Much of the reason that tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' opposition to a strong central government and the belief in states' rights, which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Historically the states had invested little money in infrastructure or public goods. Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, which was present in both the North and the South, that the war would be of limited duration and so there was no compelling reason to increase the tax burden.Godfrey, p. 14 However, the realities of the prolonged war, the necessity of paying interest on existing debt, and the drop in revenues from other sources, forced both the central Confederate government and the individual states to agree by the middle of 1861 to an imposition of a \\"War Tax.\\" Passed on August 15, 1861, the law covered property of more than $500 (Confederate) in value and several luxury items. The tax was also levied on ownership of slaves. However, the tax proved very difficult to collect. In 1862, only 5% of total revenue came from direct taxes, and it was not until 1864 that the amount reached the still-low level of 10%. Taking account of difficulty of collection, the Confederate Congress passed a tax in kind in April 1863, which was set at one tenth of all agricultural product by state. The tax was directly tied to the provisioning of the Confederate Army, and although it also ran into some collection problems, it was mostly successful. After its implementation, it accounted for about half of total revenue if it was converted into currency equivalent. Monetary finance and inflation Monthly price index in the Confederacy during the war rose from 100 in January 1861 to over 9200 in April 1865. In addition to being fueled by dramatic increases in amount of money in circulation, prices also increased in response to negative news from the battlefield. The financing of war expenditures by the means of currency issues (printing money) was by far the major avenue resorted to by the Confederate government. Between 1862 and 1865, more than 60% of total revenue was created in this way. While the North doubled its money supply during the war, the money supply in the South increased twenty times over. The extensive reliance on the money-printing press to finance the war contributed significantly to the high inflation the South experienced over the course of the war, although fiscal matters and negative war news also played a role. Estimates of the extent of inflation vary by source, method used, estimation technique, and definition of the aggregate price level. According to a classic study by Eugene Lerner in 1956, a standard price index of commodities rose from 100 at the beginning of the war to more than 9200 by the war's de facto end in April 1865.Tregarthen, Rittenberg, p. 240 By October 1864, the price index was at 2800, which implies that a very large portion of the rise in prices occurred in the last six months of the war. This drop in the demand for money, the corresponding increase in \\"velocity of money\\" (see next paragraph) and the resulting rapid increase in the price level has been attributed to the loss of confidence in Southern military victory or the success of the South's bid for independence. Quarterly inflation in the Confederacy during the war. Inflation is calculated as log growth rate of Lerner's price index. Lerner used the quantity theory of money to decompose the inflation in the Confederacy during the war into that resulting from increases in money supply, changes in the velocity of money, and the change in real output of the Southern economy. According to the equation of exchange: MV=PY where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money (related to people's demand for money), P is the price level and Y is real output. If it is assumed that real incomes remained constant in the South during the war (Lerner actually concluded that they fell by about 40%) then the equation implies that for the price level to increase 92 times in the presence of a 20 times increase in money supply, the velocity of money must have increased 4.6 times over (92/20=4.6), reflecting a very significant drop in the demand for money.Lerner, Journal of Political Economy The problems of money-caused inflation were exacerbated by the influx of counterfeit bills from the North. These were plentiful because Southern \\"Greybacks\\" were fairly crude and easy to copy, as the Confederacy lacked modern printing equipment. One of the most prolific and most famous of the Northern counterfeiters was Samuel C. Upham from Philadelphia. By one calculation Upham's notes made up between 1 and 2.5 percent of all of the Confederate money supply between June 1862 and August 1863.Weidenmier, Business and Economic History Jefferson Davis placed a $10,000 bounty on Upham, though the \\"Yankee Scoundrel\\", as he was known in the South, evaded capture by Southern agents. Counterfeiting was a problem for the North as well, and the United States Secret Service was formed to deal with this problem. The Confederate \\"Greyback\\". Note the stamp which indicates interest paid. Interest-paying money was one of the unique aspects of Confederate public finance. On April 1, 1864, the Currency Reform Act of 1864 went into effect. This decreased the Southern money supply by one-third. However, because of Union control of the Mississippi River, until January 1865 the law was effective only east of the Mississippi. A fairly peculiar economic phenomenon occurred during the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money. The United States also issued Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard. But convertibility was not implemented until 1879 (the 1863 law was never implemented, as it was superseded by the Coinage Act of 1873 and the end of the Confederacy). Debt finance Quarterly growth rate of the Confederate primary deficit in real terms. The negative values after third quarter 1862 reflect mostly the inability to find willing purchasers for Confederate debt, as the military situation of the South deteriorated. Issued loans accounted for roughly 21% of the finance of Confederate war expenditure. Initially the South was more successful in selling debt than the North, partially because New Orleans was a major financial center. Its financiers bought up two-fifths of a 15 million dollar loan in early 1861.Weigley, p. 69 The two main types of loans issued by the South during the war were \\"Cotton Bonds\\", denominated in pounds sterling and sold in London, and high risk unbacked loans sold in the Netherlands. The Cotton Bonds were convertible directly into bales of cotton, with a caveat, included as a means of political pressure on European countries to recognize the Confederacy, that any such shipments needed to be picked up by the bondholder in one of the blockaded Southern ports (mostly New Orleans). Cotton Bonds initially were very popular and in high demand among the British; William Ewart Gladstone, who at the time was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was supposedly one of the buyers. The Confederate government managed to honor the Cotton Bonds throughout the war, and in fact their price rose steeply until the fall of Atlanta to Sherman. This rise reflected both the increase in the underlying cotton prices and perhaps the possibility that George B. McClellan might get elected as US President on a peace platform. In contrast, the price of the Dutch-issued high risk loans fell throughout the war, and the South selectively defaulted on servicing these obligations. Revenue from international trade USS Monitor in action with CSS Virginia, March 9, 1862. The Union blockade seriously hampered the Confederacy's ability to raise revenue through import tariffs. In the beginning of the war, the majority of finance for the Southern government came via duties on international trade. The import tariff, enacted in May 1861, was set at 12.5% and it roughly matched in coverage the previously existing Federal tariff, the Tariff of 1857.Todd, p. 123 Between February 17 and May 1 of 1861, 65% of all government revenue was raised from the import tariff. However, revenue from the tariffs all but disappeared after the Union imposed its blockade of Southern coasts. By November 1861 the proportion of government revenue coming from custom duties had dropped to one-half of one percent. Secretary of Treasure Memminger had expected that the tariff would bring in about 25 million dollars in revenue in the first year alone. But the total revenue raised in this way during the entire war was only about $3.4 million. A similar source of funds was to be the tax on exports of cotton. However, in addition to the difficulties associated with the blockade, the self-imposed embargo on cotton meant that for all practical purposes the tax was completely ineffective as a fund raiser. Initial optimistic estimates of revenue to be collected through this tax ran as high as 20 million dollars, but in the end only $30 thousand was collected. Other sources of revenue Confederate half dollar coin The Confederate government also tried to raise revenue through unorthodox means. In the first half of 1861, when the support for secession and the military effort was running strong, the donation of coins and gold to the government accounted for about 35% of all sources of government funds. This source, however, dried up over time as individuals and institutions in the South both ran down their personal holdings of bullion and became less willing to make donations as war-weariness set in. As a consequence, by the summer of 1862, the share of government revenue coming from these donations fell to less than 1%. Over the course of the entire war, this source of revenue contributed only 0.2% of total wartime expenditure. Another potential source of finance could be found in the property and physical capital owned by Northerners in the South, and the debts owed by individuals in a parallel manner. The Sequestration Act of 1861 provided for confiscation of all Union \\"lands, tenements, goods and chattels, right and credits\\" and the transfer of debt obligation on the part of Confederate citizens from Northern creditors directly to the Confederate government. However, many Southerners proved unwilling to transfer their debt obligations. Furthermore, what exactly constituted \\"Northern property\\" proved hard to define in practice. As a result, the share of this source of revenue in government funding never exceeded 0.34% and ultimately contributed only 0.25% to the overall financial war effort. Expenditures Shares of expenditures by category, 1861 to 1864. While, unsurprisingly, military spending constituted the largest part of the national government's budget over the course of the war, over time the payment of interest and principal on acquired debt grew as a share of the Confederate government's expenditure. While initially, in early 1861, war expenditure was 95% of the budget, by October 1864 that share fell to 40%, with the majority of the rest (56% overall) being accounted for by debt service.

The constitution was Bonapartist in overall conception, with some specific concessions made in an attempt to accommodate Spanish culture. Few of its provisions were ever put into effect: Joseph Bonaparte's reign as Joseph I of Spain was a period of continuous conventional and guerrilla warAlfonso Bullon de Mendoza and Gomez de Valugera, \\"Revoluci√≥n y contrarrevoluci√≥n en Espa√±a y Am√©rica (1808‚Äì1840)\\" in Javier Parades Alonso (ed.), Espa√±a Siglo XIX, ACTAS, 1991. , p. 71‚Äì73. (See Peninsular War). Background In 1808, after a period of shaky alliance between the Spanish Antiguo R√©gimen and the Napoleonic French First Empire, the Mutiny of Aranjuez (17 March 1808) removed the king's minister Manuel de Godoy, Prince of the Peace, and led to the abdication of king Charles IV of Spain (19 March 1808).Charles J. Esdaile, Spain in the Liberal Age, Blackwell, 2000. . p. 14 for dates. His son Ferdinand VII briefly held the reins of power, but Napoleon determined to settle the monarchy of Spain on a member of his own family his older brother Joseph, conferred the title Prince of Spain to be hereditary on his children and grandchildren in the male and female line. On 5 May 1808,Charles J. Esdaile, Spain in the Liberal Age, Blackwell, 2000. . p. 15 for date. Charles IV renounced his rights to the Spanish Crown in favor of Napoleon. Later the same day, Ferdinand VII, unaware of Charles's abdication, abdicated in favor of his father, effectively passing the Crown to Napoleon. Along with other Spanish members of the House of Bourbon, including Infante Antonio Pascual of Spain, they went into a comfortable, if forced, exile in France,Martin Hume, Modern Spain, T.

In an attempt to conform at least mildly to the tradition of legal continuity, Napoleon ordered his general Joachim Murat, Grand Duke of Berg, to convene in Bayonne a Cortes of thirty deputies chosen from among the notables of Spain to help draft and to approve the constitutional basis for the new regime. However, in the context of the Dos de Mayo Uprising in Madrid and various other uprisings elsewhere in Spain, only about a third of the invited Spanish notables attended. On 4 June 1808,Cronolog√≠a.

Napoleon designated his brother Joseph as king of Spain; he was proclaimed king at Madrid on 25 July. The rump Cortes began meeting in Bayonne on 15 June to begin drafting a \\"constitution\\", for which Napoleon provided them with an extensive initial draft;Although Napoleon's initial version is lost, Bullon and Gomez (op. cit.) write, \\"...es cierto que a la asamblea... se le ofreci√≥ por Napole√≥n un proyecto ya muy maduro, y que sus atribuciones eran tan solo consultativas\\": \\"it is certain that Napoleon presented the assembly an already mature draft, and that their role was almost entirely consultative\\". it was promulgated July 8. Content Constitution of 1808 Constitution of 1808 p. 2 BNE The Bayonne Statute placed many nominal limits on royal power, but few effective ones. There was to be a tricameral legislature; nine ministers (as against five or six in recent Bourbon governments); an independent judiciary; and various individual liberties were recognized, though not freedom of religion. Although generally Bonapartist in conception, the statute shows clear influence by the few Spanish notables who were involved in drafting it that it retained Catholicism as a state religion, and banned all other religions. In the Spanish tradition, it was promulgated \\"In the name of God Almighty\\" (\\"En el nombre de Dios Todopoderoso\\"). In the event, most provisions of the Statute were never put into practice: throughout the entire Bonapartist period in Spain, the constitution was effectively suspended by French military authorities. Most decisions were made by Napoleon and his generals, not by King Joseph.Alfonso Bullon de Mendoza and Gomez de Valugera, \\"Revoluci√≥n y contrarrevoluci√≥n en Espa√±a y Am√©rica (1808‚Äì1840)\\" in Javier Parades Alonso (ed.), Espa√±a Siglo XIX, ACTAS, 1991. , p. 74‚Äì75. Nonetheless, French-controlled Spain saw some serious attempts at liberal reform, though many of them ignored the Bayonne Statute and, of course, this legislation was not recognized after the Bourbons were restored. The new regime abolished feudalism, the Inquisition, and the Council of Castile; suppressed numerous convents and monasteries as well as all military orders; declared that no new mayorazgos could be created; divided the country into French-style departments; abolished internal customs borders and many state monopolies; abolished the Mesta (a powerful association of sheep holders) and the tax known as the Voto de Santiago; privatized numerous state-owned factories; and began to introduce the Napoleonic Code into Spain's system of law.Charles J.

The species is known from a single staminate flower and a single pistillate flower both preserved in the same piece of amber. The amber specimen bearing the holotype and paratype is currently deposited in the collections of the Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon, as number \\"Sd‚Äì9‚Äì101\\", where it was studied and described by Dr George Poinar. Dr Poinar published his 2002 type description for R. palaea in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, Volume 139. The species' second name is taken from the Greek word palaios meaning \\"ancient\\". The amber specimen bearing the flowers was excavated from the La Toca mine northeast of Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic. R. palaea has been placed in the Arecoideae genus Roystonea, which has ten modern genera native to the islands of the Caribbean, and to Florida, Central and South America. Many of the characters used to separate modern species of Roystonea, including coloration, are not visible in the preserved flowers. The fossil flowers have darkened to shades of brown, with only the anthers retaining a light whitish color. Of the modern genera the R. palaea flowers are similar in structure, R. oleracea and R. dunlapiana both having a similar petal to sepal length ratio. R. palaea is most distinguishable from modern species by the large size of the calyx. The three species differ in the shape and length of their sepals, R. palaea having the longest of the species while R. dunlapiana has the shortest. R. oleracea also possesses longer anthers at which are recurved at the tips, unlike R. palaea, with anthers and straight. Along with the shorter sepal length R. dunlapiana also has purple anthers, differing from the light-colored anthers of R. palaea. Of note is the damage which is present on the pistillate flower. One side of the flower is preserved, having the peranth ripped off exposing the center of the flower and the developing fruit, which has two scratches on the exposed side. Dr Poinar proposes that the damages may have occurred due to an herbivore seizing the flower and subsequently dropping it in the soft tree resin, which afterward fossilized. This is supported by many of the modern Roystonea species having oily fruits that are eaten by a number of bird and bat species.

In clinical trials its antipsychotic efficacy was only modest but it was unexpectedly found to produce potent and rapid antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. As a result, roxindole was further researched for the treatment of depression instead. It has also been investigated as a therapy for Parkinson's disease and prolactinoma. Roxindole acts as an agonist at the following receptors: * D2 receptor (pKi = 8.55) * D3 receptor (pKi = 8.93) * D4 receptor (pKi = 8.23) * 5-HT1A receptor (pKi = 9.42) At D2 and possibly D3 receptors roxindole is a partial agonist with preferential actions at autoreceptors and has been touted as a 'selective' autoreceptor agonist, hence the justification of its application as an antipsychotic. Weaker activity at the serotonin 1B and 1D receptors has been seen. It is also a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (IC50 = 1.4 nM) and has been reported to act as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist as well.

S. Nagabharana as Ramanna * S. G. Somashekhara Rao as Mechanic Pinto Analysis Critics call it one of the first films depicting corruption in public life and the futile struggle against it. The film also throws light on the unholy nexus between politicians and media whilst focusing on the impact of drug abuse and addiction. Contrary to stereotypes of Indian cinema which include romantic interests, intense background music and songs which are generally accompanied by dance sequences. the movie takes a neo-noir approach towards investigative journalism which forms the bulk of the movie. This can be considered one of the earliest approaches towards a paradigm shift in film making in India which unfortunately didn't take off until the early 2000s due to the tragic death of Shankar Nag in 1990. Ilayaraja‚Äôs score is sombre which plays an important role in the film attuning to the grim nature of grief suffered by the lone survivor of the Accident. Background noise such as clanking of typewriter keys, camera clicks, car screeches, white television noise , bullets sliding inside a pistol, etc. form the bulk of the spacing in the movie. The silence at the scene of the accident scene is haunting. There are no songs in this movie, which provides it a far more serious pacing in comparison to the casual overtones found in most Kannada movies. Distinction amongst different classes in society is well represented in the movie and the disdain powerful politicians have towards ordinary working class people whilst not campaigning for an election is wonderfully portrayed. Every movie directed by Shankar Nag is a master piece. It would be wise to remember that with Malgudi days, he does inhabit the heart of every Indian, not just Kannadigas. He is the director that in ways more than one represents a direction which was not fully realized in India for quite sometime until independent film makers with the assistance of social media started to take things into their own creative control. Whether be it his revolutionary approach towards grand theft auto combined with prison break in Minchina Ota https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245284/ or his portrayal of everyday family life amongst the middle class in 1980 Bengaluru as witnessed Nodi Swamy Navirodu Heege,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245322/ Mr. Nag did not shy away from showcasing his versatility in directing at every opportunity presented to him. Notes Shankar Nag made the film in two months flat. The political atmosphere of the country was in turmoil. The sanctity of the \\"Golden Temple in Punjab\\" had been desecrated; the air was charged with helplessness, anger and confusion. While shooting climax of the film, Ananth Nag who was playing the politician, was to be shot in the courtyard of his house. He originally wanted to work it around the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Shankar Nag was dead sure that it had to be that way and changed ending of film. Plot Deepak (Ashok Mandanna), the spoilt son of a powerful politician Dharmadhikari (Ananth Nag) runs his imported car over pavement dwellers one fateful night under the influence of drugs. Except for a lone survivor, all are killed. Ramanna (Nagabharana), the survivor, identifies the driver. His friend Rahul (Srinivasa Prabhu), son of an advertising agency chief (Arundhati Nag), is with him during the accident. The shock of the accident leaves Rahul deeply traumatised. Unable to hold keep the secret any longer, Rahul shares the truth with his mother. She in turn implores to Dharmadhikaari to save them. Dharmadhikari who is slated to win a by-election cannot afford to let this accident ruin his political ambitions. He hushes up the case with the help of Chief Minister and sends his son on a trip abroad. Inspector Rao, (Ramesh Bhat) is the investigating officer. Ravi (Shankar Nag), a daring investigative journalist, joins him and the duo begin to putting together the evidence. With Rao‚Äôs help, Ravi gets to the bottom of the whole affair. When Rao identifies the culprits, Dharmadhikari asks his retired driver to say he was driving the car. Rao is asked to go on leave and Ravi‚Äôs editor refuses to run the story. On his way to the airport, Deepak dies in an accident. Dharmadhikari wins, but loses at the same time. Shankar Nag, apparently changed the climax. He originally wanted to work it around the assassination of Indira Gandhi Reception Accident was well received by critics and audience. The movie won the Karnataka State Film award. Accident is a testimony to the exceptional directorial ability of Shankar Nag.

The program acts as a stepping stone for businesses that may wish to progress to EarthCheck Certification programme at a later date. EarthCheck Assessed is supported by the science and technology of the Sustainable Tourism CRC (STCRC). Brief history In August, 2008 the program was introduced to market from increased demand for businesses that want to start addressing climate change and sustainability in a cost-effective way. EarthCheck Assessed has all of the calculation across energy, water and waste however does not included third party certification. It is however a valid way for restaurants and other organisations to measure, manage and reduce their environmental impact, with the cost savings involved in smart recycling, energy efficiency, management practices and policies. EarthCheck Assessed is focused on integrating these cost savings, with an online delivered cost-effective tool. Like the EarthCheck program from which it originates, EarthCheck Assessed was developed in conjunction with the Sustainable Tourism CRC. The \\"Lite\\" program was enhanced in 2009 to meet the needs of the new carbon economy and re- branded as EarthCheck Assessed Programme foundations EarthCheck Assessed is based upon the EarthCheck Certified program, however the key difference between EarthCheck Certification and EarthCheck Assessed is that EarthCheck Assessed is delivered solely online. Extra paperwork, onsite audits and other third party measures are not included, and as such this is a \\"lite\\" version of the EarthCheck Company Standard. The same set of tools are open to any participant of EarthCheck Assessed, they can measure, manage and use strategies, policies and practices to measure, manage and reduce their environmental impact, whilst reaping the benefit of operational cost savings. Similarly to EarthCheck Certification, EarthCheck Assessed is fundamentally based upon Agenda 21 Principles which was originally endorsed by 182 heads of state at the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 and provided a set of principles for local, state, national and international action on sustainable development. This resulted in Agenda 21 for the Travel and Tourism Industry: Towards Environmentally Sustainable Development, which listed an action plan for a number of overall objectives for the industry. Aspects of the upgraded EarthCheck Assessed Program EarthCheck Assessed is designed for businesses that want to start addressing Sustainability and Climate Change. The programme provides businesses with an online Health Check Framework that assesses Key Environmental Performances Areas such as energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, water consumption and waste production. The program is fully compliant with current Australian Greenhouse Office Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions protocols and reporting standards including NGERS. It is also compliant with ISO14064, the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and adheres to the UNEP Guidelines for calculating GHG Emissions for business & non commercial organisations.

They handle jobs which are serviced by multiple CPUs. Each individual node holds a specific software subset of the global aggregate operating system. Each subset is a composite of two distinct service provisioners. The first is a ubiquitous minimal kernel, or microkernel, that directly controls that node's hardware. Second is a higher-level collection of system management components that coordinate the node's individual and collaborative activities. These components abstract microkernel functions and support user applications. The microkernel and the management components collection work together. They support the system's goal of integrating multiple resources and processing functionality into an efficient and stable system. This seamless integration of individual nodes into a global system is referred to as transparency, or single system image; describing the illusion provided to users of the global system's appearance as a single computational entity. Description Structure of monolithic kernel, microkernel and hybrid kernel-based operating systems A distributed OS provides the essential services and functionality required of an OS but adds attributes and particular configurations to allow it to support additional requirements such as increased scale and availability. To a user, a distributed OS works in a manner similar to a single-node, monolithic operating system. That is, although it consists of multiple nodes, it appears to users and applications as a single-node. Separating minimal system-level functionality from additional user-level modular services provides a \\"separation of mechanism and policy\\". Mechanism and policy can be simply interpreted as \\"what something is done\\" versus \\"how something is done,\\" respectively. This separation increases flexibility and scalability. Overview=The kernel At each locale (typically a node), the kernel provides a minimally complete set of node-level utilities necessary for operating a node's underlying hardware and resources. These mechanisms include allocation, management, and disposition of a node's resources, processes, communication, and input/output management support functions. Within the kernel, the communications sub-system is of foremost importance for a distributed OS. In a distributed OS, the kernel often supports a minimal set of functions, including low-level address space management, thread management, and inter-process communication (IPC). A kernel of this design is referred to as a microkernel.Using LOTOS for specifying the CHORUS distributed operating system kernel Pecheur, C. 1992. Using LOTOS for specifying the CHORUS distributed operating system kernel. Comput. Commun. 15, 2 (Mar. 1992), 93-102.COOL: kernel support for object-oriented environments Habert, S. and Mosseri, L. 1990. COOL: kernel support for object-oriented environments. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications (Ottawa, Canada). OOPSLA/ECOOP '90. ACM, New York, NY, 269-275. Its modular nature enhances reliability and security, essential features for a distributed OS. It is common for a kernel to be identically replicated over all nodes in a system and therefore that the nodes in a system use similar hardware. The combination of minimal design and ubiquitous node coverage enhances the global system's extensibility, and the ability to dynamically introduce new nodes or services. System management components overview System management System management components are software processes that define the node's policies. These components are the part of the OS outside the kernel. These components provide higher-level communication, process and resource management, reliability, performance and security. The components match the functions of a single-entity system, adding the transparency required in a distributed environment. The distributed nature of the OS requires additional services to support a node's responsibilities to the global system. In addition, the system management components accept the \\"defensive\\" responsibilities of reliability, availability, and persistence. These responsibilities can conflict with each other. A consistent approach, balanced perspective, and a deep understanding of the overall system can assist in identifying diminishing returns. Separation of policy and mechanism mitigates such conflicts. Working together as an operating system The architecture and design of a distributed operating system must realize both individual node and global system goals. Architecture and design must be approached in a manner consistent with separating policy and mechanism. In doing so, a distributed operating system attempts to provide an efficient and reliable distributed computing framework allowing for an absolute minimal user awareness of the underlying command and control efforts. The multi-level collaboration between a kernel and the system management components, and in turn between the distinct nodes in a distributed operating system is the functional challenge of the distributed operating system. This is the point in the system that must maintain a perfect harmony of purpose, and simultaneously maintain a complete disconnect of intent from implementation. This challenge is the distributed operating system's opportunity to produce the foundation and framework for a reliable, efficient, available, robust, extensible, and scalable system. However, this opportunity comes at a very high cost in complexity. The price of complexity In a distributed operating system, the exceptional degree of inherent complexity could easily render the entire system an anathema to any user. As such, the logical price of realizing a distributed operation system must be calculated in terms of overcoming vast amounts of complexity in many areas, and on many levels. This calculation includes the depth, breadth, and range of design investment and architectural planning required in achieving even the most modest implementation.Surajbali, B., Coulson, G., Greenwood, P., and Grace, P. 2007. Augmenting reflective middleware with an aspect orientation support layer. In Proceedings of the 6th international Workshop on Adaptive and Reflective Middleware: Held At the ACM/IFIP/USENIX international Middleware Conference (Newport Beach, CA, November 26‚Äì30, 2007). ARM '07. ACM, New York, NY, 1-6. These design and development considerations are critical and unforgiving. For instance, a deep understanding of a distributed operating system's overall architectural and design detail is required at an exceptionally early point. An exhausting array of design considerations are inherent in the development of a distributed operating system. Each of these design considerations can potentially affect many of the others to a significant degree. This leads to a massive effort in balanced approach, in terms of the individual design considerations, and many of their permutations. As an aid in this effort, most rely on documented experience and research in distributed computing power. History Research and experimentation efforts began in earnest in the 1970s and continued through 1990s, with focused interest peaking in the late 1980s. A number of distributed operating systems were introduced during this period; however, very few of these implementations achieved even modest commercial success. Fundamental and pioneering implementations of primitive distributed operating system component concepts date to the early 1950s. Some of these individual steps were not focused directly on distributed computing, and at the time, many may not have realized their important impact. These pioneering efforts laid important groundwork, and inspired continued research in areas related to distributed computing.Leiner, A. L., Notz, W. A., Smith, J. L., and Weinberger, A. 1958.

In the mid-1970s, research produced important advances in distributed computing. These breakthroughs provided a solid, stable foundation for efforts that continued through the 1990s. The accelerating proliferation of multi- processor and multi-core processor systems research led to a resurgence of the distributed OS concept. 1950sThe DYSEAC One of the first efforts was the DYSEAC, a general-purpose synchronous computer. In one of the earliest publications of the Association for Computing Machinery, in April 1954, a researcher at the National Bureau of Standards now the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presented a detailed specification of the DYSEAC. The introduction focused upon the requirements of the intended applications, including flexible communications, but also mentioned other computers: The specification discussed the architecture of multi-computer systems, preferring peer-to-peer rather than master-slave. This is one of the earliest examples of a computer with distributed control. The Dept. of the Army reportsMartin H. Weik, \\"A Third Survey of Domestic Electronic Digital Computing Systems,\\" Ballistic Research Laboratories Report No. 1115, pg. 234-5, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, March 1961 certified it reliable and that it passed all acceptance tests in April 1954. It was completed and delivered on time, in May 1954. This was a \\"portable computer\\", housed in a tractor-trailer, with 2 attendant vehicles and 6 tons of refrigeration capacity. Lincoln TX-2 Described as an experimental input-output system, the Lincoln TX-2 emphasized flexible, simultaneously operational input-output devices, i.e., multiprogramming. The design of the TX-2 was modular, supporting a high degree of modification and expansion. The system employed The Multiple-Sequence Program Technique. This technique allowed multiple program counters to each associate with one of 32 possible sequences of program code. These explicitly prioritized sequences could be interleaved and executed concurrently, affecting not only the computation in process, but also the control flow of sequences and switching of devices as well. Much discussion related to device sequencing. Similar to DYSEAC the TX-2 separately programmed devices can operate simultaneously, increasing throughput. The full power of the central unit was available to any device. The TX-2 was another example of a system exhibiting distributed control, its central unit not having dedicated control. Intercommunicating Cells One early effort at abstracting memory access was Intercommunicating Cells, where a cell was composed of a collection of memory elements. A memory element was basically a binary electronic flip-flop or relay. Within a cell there were two types of elements, symbol and cell. Each cell structure stores data in a string of symbols, consisting of a name and a set of parameters. Information is linked through cell associations. The theory contended that addressing is a wasteful and non-valuable level of indirection. Information was accessed in two ways, direct and cross-retrieval. Direct retrieval accepts a name and returns a parameter set. Cross-retrieval projects through parameter sets and returns a set of names containing the given subset of parameters. This was similar to a modified hash table data structure that allowed multiple values (parameters) for each key (name). { style=\\"width=100%;\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" Cellular memory would have many advantages: - valign=\\"top\\"  width=\\"20px\\"   width=\\"10px\\"  top  A major portion of a system's logic is distributed within the associations of information stored in the cells, - valign=\\"top\\"  width=\\"20px\\"   width=\\"10px\\"  top  This flow of information association is somewhat guided by the act of storing and retrieving, - valign=\\"top\\"  width=\\"20px\\"   width=\\"10px\\"  top  The time required for storage and retrieval is mostly constant and completely unrelated to the size and fill- factor of the memory - valign=\\"top\\"  width=\\"20px\\"   width=\\"10px\\"  top  Cells are logically indistinguishable, making them both flexible to use and relatively simple to extend in size } This configuration was ideal for distributed systems. The constant-time projection through memory for storing and retrieval was inherently atomic and exclusive. The cellular memory's intrinsic distributed characteristics would be invaluable. The impact on the user, hardware/device, or Application programming interfaces was indirect.

Syst. 3, 3 Distributed computing models ‚â§ Three basic distributions To better illustrate this point, examine three system architectures; centralized, decentralized, and distributed. In this examination, consider three structural aspects: organization, connection, and control. Organization describes a system's physical arrangement characteristics. Connection covers the communication pathways among nodes. Control manages the operation of the earlier two considerations. =Organization= A centralized system has one level of structure, where all constituent elements directly depend upon a single control element. A decentralized system is hierarchical. The bottom level unites subsets of a system's entities. These entity subsets in turn combine at higher levels, ultimately culminating at a central master element. A distributed system is a collection of autonomous elements with no concept of levels. =Connection= Centralized systems connect constituents directly to a central master entity in a hub and spoke fashion. A decentralized system (aka network system) incorporates direct and indirect paths between constituent elements and the central entity. Typically this is configured as a hierarchy with only one shortest path between any two elements. Finally, the distributed operating system requires no pattern; direct and indirect connections are possible between any two elements. Consider the 1970s phenomena of ‚Äústring art‚Äù or a spirograph drawing as a fully connected system, and the spider's web or the Interstate Highway System between U.S. cities as examples of a partially connected system. =Control= Centralized and decentralized systems have directed flows of connection to and from the central entity, while distributed systems communicate along arbitrary paths. This is the pivotal notion of the third consideration. Control involves allocating tasks and data to system elements balancing efficiency, responsiveness, and complexity. Centralized and decentralized systems offer more control, potentially easing administration by limiting options. Distributed systems are more difficult to explicitly control, but scale better horizontally and offer fewer points of system-wide failure. The associations conform to the needs imposed by its design but not by organizational chaos Design considerations=Transparency Transparency or single-system image refers to the ability of an application to treat the system on which it operates without regard to whether it is distributed and without regard to hardware or other implementation details. Many areas of a system can benefit from transparency, including access, location, performance, naming, and migration. The consideration of transparency directly affects decision making in every aspect of design of a distributed operating system. Transparency can impose certain requirements and/or restrictions on other design considerations. Systems can optionally violate transparency to varying degrees to meet specific application requirements. For example, a distributed operating system may present a hard drive on one computer as \\"C:\\" and a drive on another computer as \\"G:\\". The user does not require any knowledge of device drivers or the drive's location; both devices work the same way, from the application's perspective. A less transparent interface might require the application to know which computer hosts the drive. Transparency domains: * Location transparency ‚Äì Location transparency comprises two distinct aspects of transparency, naming transparency and user mobility. Naming transparency requires that nothing in the physical or logical references to any system entity should expose any indication of the entity's location, or its local or remote relationship to the user or application. User mobility requires the consistent referencing of system entities, regardless of the system location from which the reference originates. * Access transparency ‚Äì Local and remote system entities must remain indistinguishable when viewed through the user interface. The distributed operating system maintains this perception through the exposure of a single access mechanism for a system entity, regardless of that entity being local or remote to the user. Transparency dictates that any differences in methods of accessing any particular system entity‚Äîeither local or remote‚Äîmust be both invisible to, and undetectable by the user. * Migration transparency ‚Äì Resources and activities migrate from one element to another controlled solely by the system and without user/application knowledge or action. * Replication transparency ‚Äì The process or fact that a resource has been duplicated on another element occurs under system control and without user/application knowledge or intervention. * Concurrency transparency ‚Äì Users/applications are unaware of and unaffected by the presence/activities of other users. * Failure transparency ‚Äì The system is responsible for detection and remediation of system failures. No user knowledge/action is involved other than waiting for the system to resolve the problem. * Performance Transparency ‚Äì The system is responsible for the detection and remediation of local or global performance shortfalls. Note that system policies may prefer some users/user classes/tasks over others. No user knowledge or interaction. is involved. * Size/Scale transparency ‚Äì The system is responsible for managing its geographic reach, number of nodes, level of node capability without any required user knowledge or interaction. * Revision transparency ‚Äì The system is responsible for upgrades and revisions and changes to system infrastructure without user knowledge or action. * Control transparency ‚Äì The system is responsible for providing all system information, constants, properties, configuration settings, etc. in a consistent appearance, connotation, and denotation to all users and applications. * Data transparency ‚Äì The system is responsible for providing data to applications without user knowledge or action relating to where the system stores it. * Parallelism transparency ‚Äì The system is responsible for exploiting any ability to parallelize task execution without user knowledge or interaction. Arguably the most difficult aspect of transparency, and described by Tanenbaum as the \\"Holy grail\\" for distributed system designers. Inter-process communication Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is the implementation of general communication, process interaction, and dataflow between threads and/or processes both within a node, and between nodes in a distributed OS. The intra-node and inter-node communication requirements drive low-level IPC design, which is the typical approach to implementing communication functions that support transparency. In this sense, Interprocess communication is the greatest underlying concept in the low-level design considerations of a distributed operating system. Process management Process management provides policies and mechanisms for effective and efficient sharing of resources between distributed processes. These policies and mechanisms support operations involving the allocation and de-allocation of processes and ports to processors, as well as mechanisms to run, suspend, migrate, halt, or resume process execution. While these resources and operations can be either local or remote with respect to each other, the distributed OS maintains state and synchronization over all processes in the system. As an example, load balancing is a common process management function. Load balancing monitors node performance and is responsible for shifting activity across nodes when the system is out of balance. One load balancing function is picking a process to move. The kernel may employ several selection mechanisms, including priority-based choice. This mechanism chooses a process based on a policy such as 'newest request'. The system implements the policy Resource management Systems resources such as memory, files, devices, etc. are distributed throughout a system, and at any given moment, any of these nodes may have light to idle workloads. Load sharing and load balancing require many policy-oriented decisions, ranging from finding idle CPUs, when to move, and which to move. Many algorithms exist to aid in these decisions; however, this calls for a second level of decision making policy in choosing the algorithm best suited for the scenario, and the conditions surrounding the scenario. Reliability Distributed OS can provide the necessary resources and services to achieve high levels of reliability, or the ability to prevent and/or recover from errors. Faults are physical or logical defects that can cause errors in the system. For a system to be reliable, it must somehow overcome the adverse effects of faults. The primary methods for dealing with faults include fault avoidance, fault tolerance, and fault detection and recovery. Fault avoidance covers proactive measures taken to minimize the occurrence of faults. These proactive measures can be in the form of transactions, replication and backups. Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operation in the presence of a fault. In the event, the system should detect and recover full functionality. In any event, any actions taken should make every effort to preserve the single system image. Availability Availability is the fraction of time during which the system can respond to requests. Performance Many benchmark metrics quantify performance; throughput, response time, job completions per unit time, system utilization, etc. With respect to a distributed OS, performance most often distills to a balance between process parallelism and IPC. Managing the task granularity of parallelism in a sensible relation to the messages required for support is extremely effective. Also, identifying when it is more beneficial to migrate a process to its data, rather than copy the data, is effective as well. Synchronization Cooperating concurrent processes have an inherent need for synchronization, which ensures that changes happen in a correct and predictable fashion. Three basic situations that define the scope of this need: :* one or more processes must synchronize at a given point for one or more other processes to continue, :* one or more processes must wait for an asynchronous condition in order to continue, :* or a process must establish exclusive access to a shared resource. Improper synchronization can lead to multiple failure modes including loss of atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability, deadlock, livelock and loss of serializability. Flexibility Flexibility in a distributed operating system is enhanced through the modular and characteristics of the distributed OS, and by providing a richer set of higher-level services. The completeness and quality of the kernel/microkernel simplifies implementation of such services, and potentially enables service providers greater choice of providers for such services.

Born in Toronto, Ontario, Buczynski earned an associate degree from The Royal Conservatory of Music in 1951 and a Licentiate in 1953. While there he studied music composition with Godfrey Ridout and piano with Earle Moss. He studied under Darius Milhaud and Charles Jones at the Aspen Music Festival and School in 1955. He pursued further studies in piano with Rosina Lh√©vinne in New York City in 1958-1959. He won a number of grants from the Government of Poland which enabled him to study music composition with Zbigniew Drzewiecki in Warsaw in 1959 and 1961. Likewise, grants from the Canada Council made it possible for him to study under Nadia Boulanger in Paris in 1960 and 1962. In 1951 and 1952 Buczynski was awarded second prizes at the Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada composition competition, going on to win first prize there in 1954 with a piano trio. In 1955 he won the Fromm Foundation Award with the Suite for Woodwind Quintet. That same year he made his debut as a concert pianist with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra playing Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor. Buczynski went on to have an active concert career during the 1960s and early 1970s, giving recitals in major concert venues throughout Canada and in New York City, Paris, and Warsaw. His concerts often featured his own work and pieces by other contemporary Canadian composers in addition to traditional repertoire. He made several appearances on CBC Radio as well and made a number of solo recordings. In 1977 he decided to drastically limit his performance schedule to focus on his teaching career and composition work. Of the few concerts he gave later, his 23 September 1982 Toronto recital was particularly notable as he played only his music. In 1962 Buczynski joined the piano and music theory faculty at The Royal Conservatory of Music. He left there in 1969 to teach on the faculty of the University of Toronto, where he taught piano and composition until his retirement in 1999. Among his notable pupils were composers John Burge and Timothy Sullivan. He served as the president of the Canadian League of Composers in 1974-1975. On 18 December 1983 a special concert honoring his 50th birthday was given by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the University of Toronto Faculty of Music.

It is the policy of the Hong Kong government to discourage smoking. Smoking is banned in most public places and tobacco advertising is prohibited. History The Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance came into effect in 1982. Prevalence The overall daily smoking rate in Hong Kong was 10 per cent in 2017. This has declined from 23.3 per cent in the early 1980s. Hong Kong has the world's longest lifespan, and experts have attributed this to the low smoking rate. In 2015 there were 641,300 daily smokers (of which 538,300 or 83.9 per cent were male and 103,000 or 16.1 per cent female). Approximately 19 per cent of Hong Kong males smoke whereas in China 53 per cent of males smoke. Policy and legislation It is the policy of the Hong Kong government to discourage smoking and to reduce the impact of second-hand smoke on the general public. The Department of Health is generally responsible for enforcing government policies regarding smoking. Smoking in public has been banned from 1 January 2007 under the government's revised Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), first enacted in 1982 with several amendments subsequently. The latest amendment enlarges the smoking ban to include indoor workplaces, most public places including restaurants, Internet caf√©s, public lavatories, beaches and most public parks. Some bars, karaoke parlors, saunas and nightclub were exempt until 1 July 2009. Smoking bans in lifts, public transport, cinemas, concert halls, airport terminal and escalators had been phased in between 1982 and 1997. The ban in shopping centres, department stores, supermarkets, banks, game arcades has been in place since July 1998. An anomaly to the smoking ban are on cross-border trains between Hong Kong and mainland China as they are operated jointly between MTR Corporation and China Railway, of whom the latter allows smoking in the restaurant car and in the vestibules at the end of the cars, but not in the seating area. Any person who smokes or carries a lit tobacco product in a statutory no smoking area commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of HK$5,000. Unlike many other jurisdictions, Hong Kong does not place the onus on licensees of liquor licensed premises to enforce smoking bans with subsequent loss of licence for non compliance. A new law, to enter into force in September 2009, provides for fixed-penalty arrangement (HK$1,500) for smoking, on a par with that for littering. At the same time smoking will be banned in designated public transport interchanges, but the Government has yet to clarify how it will enforce this against non Hong Kong ID card holders and tourists, since the offender has 21 days after the ticket issue to pay up. E-cigarettes In light of use of e-cigarettes among primary and secondary school students, the government is considering prohibiting the import and sale of e-cigarettes. It says there are health concerns associated with e-cigarettes, and that the devices may make smoking mainstream again, particularly among Hong Kong youth. Other policies Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's flag carrier, became the first Asian airline to introduce non-smoking flights in June 1990. By 1993, 60 per cent of the company's flights were non- smoking. Smoking (or carrying a lighted cigarette) is banned in common areas of public housing estates of the Housing Authority. Smoking offenders are liable to receive five points under the housing provider's Marking Scheme, a demerit point system used to enforce housing estate rules.

Edoardo Weber (29 November 1889 ‚Äì 17 May 1945) was an Italian engineer and businessman, famous for creating the Weber carburetor. He was born in Torino to a Swiss father and mother from Piemonte. After graduating in mechanical engineering from the Universit√† degli Studi di Torino (1913) he moved to Bologna to work for Fiat. He was a tutor to Am√©d√©e Gordini and, at Mugello, he raced a Fiat 501 to third place on 13 June 1920. His work to remedy high gasoline prices resulted in the first Weber carburetor, a \\"sidedraft, twin-choke ... bolted to a Weber designed overhead- valve/supercharger conversion for the 501 Fiat\\". In 1923 he established the Fabbrica Italiana Carburatori Weber company, which under his leadership became supplier to Fiat mass-produced cars as well as small-volume Alfa Romeo and Maserati racing cars. Weber was with the Italian Fascist Party. In 1937 he received the Order of the Crown of Italy and in 1943 the Order of Merit for Labour. Bologna was liberated on April 21 of 1945 by Italian Co-belligerent Army. Three weeks later, on May 17, 1945, Weber was picked up from his office early in the morning by civilians who came to the factory in Via Del Timavo 18. He was never seen since, presumably executed by the Italian resistance movement. After his disappearance in May 1945, Fiat eventually assumed control of the company in 1952.

Reviews Emine Yƒ±ldrƒ±m, writing in Today's Zaman, describes the film as, \\"a borderline emotion exploiter that performs quite pleasantly despite some of its excesses until that point at the very end in which the filmmakers transform their cute story into a slice of unnecessary arabesque.\\" \\"The film\\", he continues, \\"has a lot of funny and sweet moments thanks to the enthusiasm of the actors who are playing the blind team members, and director Ert√ºrk should be congratulated for portraying them with respect instead of pity\\", and, \\"I was smiling with amusement as I was watching this quasi-sports comedy until I was subjected to the bombardment of sentiment in the movie's final 10 minutes, thus I regret to say that I couldn't help ending up cowered with a sour expression on my face. They had taken away my feel-good moment, and I don't even know for what purpose.\\" He concludes that the film, \\"has the potential to reach the hearts of enough audience members; it tries to illustrate a positive message - anyone can do anything.

It is native to Canada and the United States. Taxonomy Prairie violet was first formally named in 1831 by the Scottish botanist George Don (1798‚Äì1856). The specific epithet pedatifida means \\"palmately divided with cleft segments\\" in botanical Latin, in reference to the leaves, which look like a bird's foot with the outer toes again parted. It may hybridize with the common blue violet, Viola sororia. Description Prairie violet grows tall with violet flowers and between 2‚Äì11 deeply divided leaves. It is an acaulescent violet, meaning it lacks leaves on the flowering stems. The leaves have 5‚Äì9 lanceolate to linear lobes, growing up to long and across. Prairie violet flowers between March and June. The flowers are light violet, the lower three petals white near the base, usually with some hairs. It forms ellipsoid capsules in the summer. Distribution and habitat Viola pedatifida is native broadly across the central United States and south-central Canada, from Alberta to Ontario, south to Arkansas, west to New Mexico. It has a disjunct distribution in Virginia where it grows in Appalachian shale barrens. Across much of its range, prairie violet grows in dry prairies and other dry, sunny habitats.

Of these nominations, Congress confirmed 329 judgeships, 173 during the 111th & 112th Congresses and 156 during the 113th and 114th Congresses. The most potent filibustering of Obama's nominees occurred in the Republican controlled 114th Congress. Obama nominated 69 people for 104 different federal appellate judgeships during this Congress, and although some nominees were processed by the Republican- controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, many of them stalled on the floor of the Senate. With the death of Antonin Scalia in February 2016, in the beginning of a presidential election year, the Republican majority in the Senate made it their stated policy to refuse to consider any nominee to the Supreme Court put forward by Obama, arguing that the next president should be the one to appoint Scalia's replacement. Scalia's death was only the second death of a serving justice in a span of sixty years. Even while Democrats still controlled the Senate (2009-2015), Republicans filibustered many nominees, and Senator Chuck Grassley commented that more nominees could have been confirmed had Obama respected recess appointment precedent by not making recess appointments while the Senate was in session.Larry Margasak, Senate confirms Cuban-born judge to 11th Circuit (February 15, 2012). Although Obama never used a recess appointment to appoint a nominee to the federal bench, he had appointed some executive agency officials in January 2012. As a response to the continuing blocking of several of Obama's nominees, Senator Harry Reid on November 21, 2013, invoked the so-called nuclear option and changed the Senate rules, meaning that a simple majority vote would suffice for all nominees except for the Supreme Court. This significantly sped up the pace of confirmations during 2014, especially to the district courts. Denied Supreme Court nomination Following the February 2016 death of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia, President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. At the time of his nomination, Garland was the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Scalia's death led to an unusual situation in which a Democratic president had the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court nominee while the Republicans controlled the United States Senate; before Scalia's death, such a situation last occurred when a Senate Republican majority confirmed Grover Cleveland's nomination of Rufus Wheeler Peckham in 1895. Conversely, in February 1988, during an election year, the Democratic- controlled Senate confirmed Anthony Kennedy, who was the Republican President Ronald Reagan's nominee for the Supreme Court, though Kennedy had been nominated in November 1987 and was Reagan's third nomination to the seat. Garland himself was not personally controversial. However, political commentators widely recognized Scalia as one of the more conservative members of the Court, and noted that a more liberal replacement could shift the Court's ideological balance for many years into the future. The confirmation of Garland would have given Democratic appointees a majority on the Supreme Court for the first time since the 1970 confirmation of Harry Blackmun. After the death of Scalia, Republican Senate leaders announced that they planned to hold no vote on any potential nomination during the president's last year in office.Levy, Gabrielle. \\"Even GOP Voters Think Senate Should Confirm SCOTUS Nominee\\", U.S. News and World Report (March 31, 2016): \\"Because Obama has less than a year left in his term, McConnell said, he should not get to make a lifetime appointment...\\" Senate Democrats responded that there was sufficient time to vote on a nominee before the election. Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress. The nomination remained before the Senate for 293 days,Jess Bravin, President Obama's Supreme Court Nomination of Merrick Garland Expires, The Wall Street Journal (January 3, 2017). which is more than twice as long as any other Supreme Court nomination. On January 31, 2017, President Donald Trump announced his selection of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the position. Gorsuch was later confirmed on April 7, 2017 by a vote of 54‚Äì45 and sworn in on April 10, 2017. List of failed, stalled or filibustered appellate nominees=Failed nominees *United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ** Robert Chatigny (of Connecticut), to seat vacated by Guido Calabresi: during the 111th Congress, Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd recommended Chatigny for a judgeship on the Second Circuit, and he was nominated by President Obama on February 24, 2010. The nomination quickly caused an uproar. Critics of Chatigny's nomination highlighted his controversial performance during the trial of serial killer Michael Bruce Ross, for whom Chatigny granted a temporary stay of execution. Critics also pointed out his 2001 ruling declaring that a sex offender registration system violated a convict's civil rights and right to privacy, which was a ruling that drew bipartisan condemnation. His nomination was returned by the Senate on August 5, 2010. Dodd, his main sponsor, did not seek reelection to the U.S. Senate that year. Chatigny removed his name from consideration and was not renominated when the 112th Congress convened. Obama later chose U.S. District Judge Christopher F. Droney to fill the seat to which Chatigny had been nominated, and the Senate confirmed Droney without opposition on November 28, 2011. *United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ** Goodwin Liu (of California), to newly created seat: Liu was nominated on February 24, 2010. His nomination was returned by the Senate on August 5, 2010.Bob Egelko, Republicans block Bay Area judicial nominees, San Francisco Chronicle (August 7, 2010). Liu had faced opposition due to his outspoken support of same-sex marriage and affirmative action, and a 2008 article he wrote which claimed that there was a Constitutional right to receive welfare. He was also denounced for his personal criticism of the Supreme Court nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito.An Exceptional Nominee, The New York Times (March 27, 2010). Republican opposition to Liu was also due in part to his being considered as a possible Supreme Court candidate. Liu was renominated at the start of the 112th Congress. On May 17, 2011, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed for cloture on Liu's nomination, with 60 votes needed to proceed to a floor vote on Liu's nomination. The cloture motion attracted only 52 of the 60 aye votes required. On May 25, 2011, Liu wrote to Obama requesting that his nomination be withdrawn due to the improbability that he would receive a floor vote.Letter to President Obama, University of California (May 25, 2011). On July 26, 2011, Governor Jerry Brown nominated Liu to a seat on the Supreme Court of California, and he was sworn in on September 1, 2011. Obama later nominated U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Nguyen to the Ninth Circuit seat to which Liu had been nominated, and the Senate confirmed her without opposition on May 7, 2012. * United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ** Edward C. DuMont: DuMont was nominated to the Federal Circuit on April 14, 2010.Presidential Nominations and Withdrawal sent to the Senate, White House press release (April 14, 2010). If he had been confirmed, DuMont would have been the first openly gay United States appeals court judge. The nomination languished for 18 months before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which never scheduled a hearing on it, despite having had hearings and votes for two later nominees to the same court. A spokesperson for Senator Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the committee, said in August 2011 only that \\"There are questions in Mr. DuMont's background investigation that have to be resolved.\\" In November 2011, the National Law Journal reported that DuMont had submitted a letter to President Obama, asking that the president withdraw his nomination because one or more senators of the minority party on the Committee refused to allow the committee to give him a hearing. Obama withdrew DuMont's nomination later that day. In November 2011, Obama nominated Richard G. Taranto to the seat to which DuMont had been nominated, and the Senate confirmed him without opposition on March 11, 2013. *United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ** Victoria F. Nourse (of Wisconsin), to a seat vacated by Terence T. Evans: Nourse, a former counsel for the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, was recommended by Senator Russ Feingoldhttp://images.wisbar.org/Template.cfm?Section=News&Template;=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID;=89976 After defeating Senator Feingold in the 2010 midterm elections, newly elected Senator Ron Johnson blocked Nourse's nomination. From 2011 to his exit from office, President Obama failed to resubmit her name. Obama tried a second nominee to fill the seat in 2016, Donald Karl Schott, who was approved by the Judiciary Committee, but he did not receive a vote on the floor. The seat was filled in 2018 by President Trump nominee Michael B. Brennan. *United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ** Stephen Six (of Kansas), to seat vacated by Deanell Reece Tacha. Former Kansas Attorney General Six was opposed by both home state Senators. Republicans claimed that he was a liberal extremist who would substitute his personal opinions for the law and the Constitution. Six's critics strongly condemned his conduct in a 2008 investigation of physician George Tiller, who was charged with performing illegal late-term abortions. Six was accused of improperly quashing a subpoena for Tiller's patient records. Because of opposition by both of his home state Senators and negative publicity, the Senate Judiciary Committee did not act upon the nomination. The nomination was returned to the president on December 17, 2011, pursuant to the rules of the Senate, and the president chose not to renominate him. President Obama later chose Kansas Supreme Court Justice Nancy Moritz to fill the seat to which Six had been nominated, and the Senate confirmed Moritz on May 5, 2014. *United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ** Caitlin Halligan (of New York), to seat vacated by John Roberts: on September 29, 2010, President Obama nominated New York Solicitor Halligan. She became controversial because of her statement that \\"gun manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers contributed to a 'public nuisance' of illegal handguns in the state.\\" Her critics used that to claim that she was a liberal ideologue who would not uphold the Second Amendment and would base rulings on personal opinion rather than the law. Halligan was blocked by Senate Republicans in a mostly party-line filibuster in December 2011. Obama renominated Halligan to the D.C. Circuit in June 2012. The nomination was again returned to the President on August 3, 2012, as a result of Republicans refusing to allow the nomination to be held over during the Senate's extended summer recess. Obama renominated Halligan to the seat on September 19, 2012. On March 22, 2013, the President officially withdrew Halligan's nomination. On June 4, 2013, Obama nominated Patricia Millett to fill the vacancy. The Senate confirmed her on December 10, 2013.

Prior to President Obama's successful appointment of Hamilton, President George W. Bush had unsuccessfully nominated Philip P. Simon to succeed Judge Ripple, who assumed senior status in September 2008. Hamilton's nomination generated opposition from groups who objected to some of his rulings while serving as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, particularly those dealing with abortion and prayer.Kate Phillips, Senate Confirms Judge to Appeals Court, The Caucus Blog ‚Äì New York Times (November 19, 2009).

In January 2012, The New York Times reported that Menendez had not given a reason for not returning his blue slip and noted that Shwartz long had been in a relationship with the head of the public corruption unit for New Jersey's federal prosecutor. That was the unit that investigated Menendez during his 2006 election fight‚Äîan investigation that Menendez contended was politically motivated. On January 13, 2012, Menendez announced that he had dropped his opposition to Shwartz's nomination. On February 15, 2012, Shwartz received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On March 8, 2012, the Judiciary Committee reported her nomination to the floor of the Senate by a vote of 10 ayes to 6 nays. On January 2, 2013, her nomination was returned to the President, due to the sine die adjournment of the Senate. On January 3, 2013, she was renominated. Her nomination was reported to the floor by the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 14, 2013, by a vote of 11 ayes to 7 nays. The Senate confirmed the nomination on April 9, 2013 by a 64‚Äì34 vote. *United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ** Andrew D. Hurwitz (of Arizona), to seat vacated by Mary M. Schroeder: Some Republican senators had objected to Hurwitz and required a cloture vote on his nomination because of his role some 40 years earlier as a young law clerk. Hurwitz had been a law clerk for then-U.S. District Judge Jon O. Newman, and in a 2002 law review article, Hurwitz wrote that he had helped to write‚Äîand still admires the legal framework for‚ÄîNewman's opinion striking down Connecticut's abortion law, just a year before the U.S. Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. Both of Hurwitz's home-state senators have supported his nomination, but other Republican senators objected to it. After a Republican filibuster on Hurwitz's nomination, senators voted 60‚Äì31 on June 11, 2012 to invoke cloture. Senators then confirmed Hurwitz on June 12, 2012, in a voice vote. *United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ** Robert E. Bacharach (of Oklahoma), to seat vacated by Robert Harlan Henry. A United States Magistrate Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma since 1999, Bacharach was blocked by Senate Republicans in a 56‚Äì34 cloture vote on July 30, 2012, with 60 votes needed to break the filibuster. The reason for the Republican filibuster was not any objection to Bacharach himself, but their contention that the consideration of his nomination had come too late in a presidential election year, per the informal Thurmond Rule. After President Obama was reelected to a second term, Bacharach was confirmed by the Senate in February 2013 by a vote of 93‚Äì0. *United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ** Adalberto Jordan (of Florida), to seat vacated by Susan H. Black. Jordan's nomination was the subject of a filibuster by Senate Republicans, who had no major objections to Jordan himself but were angry by unrelated recess appointments by President Obama in early January 2012. On February 9, 2012, Senator Harry Reid motioned to invoke cloture on Jordan's nomination. Cloture was achieved in an 89‚Äì5 vote on February 13, 2012, and the Senate confirmed Jordan on February 15, 2012 in a 94‚Äì5 vote. **Jill A. Pryor Originally nominated February 16, 2012 to seat vacated by Stanley F. Birch. Georgia's two Republican senators Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss refused to return their blue slips, thus blocking her nomination. In September 2013, it was reported that a deal was in the works between the White House and the Senators to ensure a hearing on the Pryor nomination and to fill the other district court vacancies within Georgia, thus upsetting those in the Georgia's Democratic delegation. On May 13, 2014, a hearing was held on her nomination. On June 19, 2014, her nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote. On July 30, 2014, Senator Harry Reid motioned to invoke cloture on Pryor's nomination. On July 31, 2014, the Senate voted 58‚Äì33 for cloture on Pryor's nomination. On September 8, 2014, the Senate voted 97‚Äì0 in favor of confirmation. *United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit **Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard to seats respectively vacated by John G. Roberts, Jr. and Douglas H. Ginsburg: in November 2013, Republicans blocked the nomination of three nominees by filibustering. Republican Senators called Obama's nominations \\"court packing\\", which evoked but was not analogous to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937. As a response to these actions Senator Harry Reid on November 21, 2013, invoked the so-called nuclear option which changed the Senate rules and meant that a simple majority vote would suffice for all nominees except for Supreme Court nominees. Millet was confirmed on December 10, 2013, by a vote of 56‚Äì38, Pillard was confirmed on December 11, 2013, by a vote of 51-44. **Robert L. Wilkins to seat vacated by David B. Sentelle: in November 2013, Republicans blocked the nomination of Wilkins by filibustering. On November 14, 2013, Senator Harry Reid motioned to invoke cloture on Wilkins' nomination. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on November 18, 2013, by a vote of 53‚Äì38. Republican Senators called Obama's nominations to the DC Court \\"court packing\\", which evoked but was not analogous to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937. As a response to these actions, Reid on November 21, 2013, invoked the so-called nuclear option which changed the Senate rules and meant that a simple majority vote would suffice for all nominees except for Supreme Court nominees. Cloture was subsequently invoked on January 9, 2014, by a vote of 55‚Äì38. Wilkins was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 55-43 on January 13, 2014. His confirmation marked the first time the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had a full complement of judges in over 22 years since Clarence Thomas left the court on October 23, 1991 upon his elevation to the Supreme Court. List of failed, stalled or filibustered district court nominees=Failed nominees *United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin **Louis B. Butler: Butler ran for the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2000, but was defeated by a wide margin. He was appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2004, but he narrowly lost the 2008 election to retain the seat. On September 30, 2009, President Obama nominated Butler to serve as a judge. Critics argued that Butler should not be appointed to the federal bench after having been twice rejected by the voters of his state. Butler's critics also accused him of being a liberal ideologue who was hostile to tough criminal sentences and the rights of gun owners. He was also controversial for a ruling which effectively overturned the state's limits on non-economic damages in medical malpractice suits and another ruling in which he supported \\"collective liability\\" in lead paint cases in which companies could be held liable for products that they didn't produce. This led to charges that he was overly beholden to trial lawyers. Senator Ron Johnson, who was elected in 2010, immediately put a hold on Butler's nomination once he took office, and senators returned Butler's nomination to the White House in December 2011. On November 7, 2013, Obama nominated James D. Peterson to fill this vacancy, and he was confirmed on May 8, 2014. *United States District Court for the District of Maryland **Charles Bernard Day: Day, a U.S. Magistrate Judge in Maryland, was initially nominated in July 2010, but his nomination was withdrawn by President Obama on October 31, 2011. According to Senators Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin, Day was blocked from receiving a hearing by Senate Republicans. However, Senator Chuck Grassley stated that Committee members had \\"insurmountable concerns\\" about matters raised during a background investigation of Day, adding that Day \\"is aware of those problems and is free to share that information if he so desires. In November 2011, Obama nominated George Levi Russell III to fill the vacant seat to which Day had been nominated, and the Senate confirmed Russell on May 14, 2012. *United States District Court for the Western District of New York **Michael Charles Green: Green, then Monroe County District Attorney in western New York, was nominated on January 26, 2011. At first, he generated little controversy and was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But his nomination languished for more than six months before being returned to the White House at the behest of Senate Republicans at the end of the session of Congress that concluded in December 2011. Utah Senator Mike Lee was the lone senator to oppose Green in the committee vote. In follow-up questions to his hearing testimony, however, several Republican senators focused on Green's decision to seek drug treatment rather than jail for some offenders, while others queried Green about his views on the death penalty. On December 18, 2011, a White House spokesman told a local newspaper that President Obama would not be renominating Green to the seat. \\"Mike Green would have made an outstanding judge, and it is very unfortunate not only for him, but for a strong judiciary, that partisan politics stood in the way,\\" Senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement on December 18, 2011. On December 19, 2011, Green said at a press conference that he blamed local opposition on his failed judicial nomination, as a result of his prosecution of public corruption. In May 2012, Obama nominated longtime Rochester judge Frank Paul Geraci, Jr. to the seat to which Green had been nominated, and the Senate confirmed Geraci without opposition on December 13, 2012. *United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York **Diane Gujarati: On September 13, 2016, President Obama nominated Assistant U.S. Attorney Gujarati to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, to the seat vacated by Judge John Gleeson, who resigned on March 9, 2016.https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press- office/2016/09/13/president-obama-nominates-diane-gujarati-serve-united- states-district Gujarti herself drew no controversy. However, her nomination came in the final months of the Obama Administration and Republicans claimed that the Senate didn't have enough time to hold hearings on her. The nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress.https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press- office/2016/09/13/presidential-nominations-sent-senate-0 *United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma **Arvo Mikkanen: Mikkanen was nominated after being recommended by Democratic Governor Brad Henry. His nomination was immediately met with opposition from members of Oklahoma's congressional delegation, with Republican Senators James Inhofe and Tom Coburn and Democratic Representative Dan Boren expressing disappointment that they were not consulted on the nomination. However, the White House disputed that they did not consult with the Oklahoma congressional delegation. Public opposition to Mikkanen's nomination had centered around procedural grounds rather than substantive issues about Mikkanen himself. In February 2012, President Obama nominated then-federal magistrate judge John E. Dowdell to the seat to which Mikkanen had been nominated. The Senate confirmed Dowdell unanimously on December 11, 2012. *United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia **Natasha Perdew Silas: Georgia's two Republican senators, Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss, opposed Silas, a staff attorney at the Federal Public Defender program for Northern Georgia, for reasons which they declined to discuss publicly. As a result, Silas did not receive a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Her nomination was returned to Obama on December 17, 2011. On December 19, 2013, Obama nominated Mark Howard Cohen to fill this vacancy. He was confirmed on November 18, 2014. **Linda T. Walker: Originally nominated on January 26, 2011. Her nomination expired when it was returned to the President on December 17, 2011. On December 19, 2013, Obama nominated Leigh Martin May to fill this vacancy. She was confirmed on November 13, 2014. **Michael P. Boggs: Originally nominated on December 19, 2013 to the seat expected to be vacated by Judge Julie E. Carnes, who was nominated to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on the same day. David Scott, U.S. Representative from Georgia's 13th district, criticized the nomination of Boggs because of Boggs' votes in the legislature to retain Confederate insignia in the state flag of Georgia, restrict abortion, and ban same-sex marriage. Boggs was nominated as part of a group of nominees that won approval of Georgia's U.S. Senators, to allow votes on their nominations. He received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 13, 2014, but his nomination was not reported from committee. On December 30, 2014, Senator Chambliss revealed that he had been advised in late November by White House chief of staff Denis McDonough that Boggs would not be renominated.Sullivan, Peter \\"Obama drops nominee opposed by CBC\\" The Hill, December 31, 2014 On July 30, 2015 the President nominated judge Dax Eric L√≥pez to the vacancy. **Dax Eric L√≥pez: On July 30, 2015, President Obama nominated L√≥pez to serve as a judge, to the seat vacated by Julie E. Carnes, who was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Senator David Perdue announced that he would not return Lopez's blue slip, effectively killing his nomination. The seat was later filled by Trump nominee Michael Lawrence Brown. *United States District Court for the District of Nevada **Elissa F. Cadish: On February 16, 2012, President Obama nominated Cadish, a Clark County District Court Judge, to be a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. She would have replaced Philip M. Pro who took senior status in 2011. Because Senator Heller had refused to return his blue slip, the Senate Judiciary Committee did not hold a hearing on her nomination. Heller's opposition to her nomination and his invocation of \\"senatorial courtesy\\" was because of a statement by Cadish indicating that she believed that there was no individual right to keep and bear arms, a statement which was made in 2008, prior to Supreme Court decisions explicitly recognizing an individual right to keep and bear arms. On March 8, 2013, Cadish requested that President Obama withdraw her nomination, and on March 13, 2013, Obama formally withdrew the nomination. On January 16, 2014, Obama nominated Richard Franklin Boulware II to fill this vacancy, and he was confirmed on June 10, 2014. *United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida **William L. Thomas: On November 14, 2012, President Obama nominated Thomas to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to replace Adalberto Jordan. If confirmed, Thomas would have been the first openly gay black male to serve as a federal judge. On January 2, 2013, his nomination was returned to the President, due to the sine die adjournment of the Senate. On January 3, 2013, he was renominated to the same office. On September 19, 2013, Senator Marco Rubio announced that ‚Äì although originally he recommended Thomas to the President ‚Äì he would not return his blue slip. His nomination was returned to the President because of the sine die adjournment of Congress on January 3, 2014. Obama decided not to resubmitt the nomination a third time. Florida Circuit Court Judge Robin L. Rosenberg was nominated to the seat on February 26, 2014, and she was confirmed on July 22, 2014. *United States District Court for the District of South Carolina **Alison Renee Lee: A state Circuit Court Judge since 1999, Lee was originally nominated on June 26, 2013, to the seat being vacated by Cameron McGowan Currie, who took senior status on October 3, 2013. South Carolina Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott opposed her nomination because of a controversial decision that she made involving burglary suspect Lorenzo Young. Lee consolidated his bonds and reduced the bond total from $225,000 to $175,000 for Young, who subsequently was released and then later charged in a July 1 murder. Because of opposition from her home state senators and no opportunity of receiving a committee hearing, on September 18, 2014, Obama withdrew her nomination. The seat was filled in 2019 by Trump nominee A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr.. *United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina **Jennifer Prescod May-Parker: Originally nominated June 20, 2013, to the seat vacated by Malcolm Jones Howard, she did not receive a hearing. Senator Richard Burr did not return his blue slip. Her nomination was returned on December 16, 2014 because of the adjournment of the 113th Congress. President Obama chose not to renominate her. The seat was later filled by Trump nominee Richard E. Myers II. *United States District Court for the District of Kansas **Terrence J. Campbell: On January 28, 2016, President Obama nominated Campbell to serve as a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, to the seat vacated by Kathryn H. Vratil, who took senior status on April 22, 2014. On December 7, 2016, Campbell, in letters to Obama and Kansas Senators Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran, requested that his name be withdrawn from further consideration. His nomination expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the 114th Congress. The seat was later filled by Trump nominee Holly Lou Teeter. * United States District Court for the District of Utah **Ronald G. Russell: On December 16, 2015, President Obama nominated former Centerville Mayor Russell to serve on the United States District Court for the District of Utah, to the seat vacated by Ted Stewart, who took senior status on September 1, 2014. Russell, a Republican, had the support of Utah Senators Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee. Russell received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 20, 2016, and was approved without objection on May 19. However, Russell's nomination stalled on the floor, due to the blockade on confirmations imposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Democratic objections to expediting Russell's nomination without confirming longer-pending Democrats. Without floor action, Russell's nomination was returned to the White House unconfirmed on January 3, 2017. The seat was later filled by Trump nominee Howard C. Nielson Jr.. Successfully appointed nominees *United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island **John J. McConnell, Jr.: McConnell was first nominated on March 10, 2010. McConnell had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic campaigns, including over eight thousand each to the campaigns of Rhode Island Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse. McConnell's critics contended that his prolific political contributions suggest that McConnell would be a partisan judge. On May 4, 2011, the Senate invoked cloture on McConnell's nomination in a 63‚Äì33 vote, and he was confirmed later that same day in a 50‚Äì44 vote. At the time, the cloture petition to break the filibuster marked one of the rare instances that such a motion had been required to force a vote on a district court nominee, with only three prior instances recorded. *United States District Court for the Northern District of California **Edward M. Chen: Chen faced opposition due to his work as an attorney for the ACLU.Bob Egelko, Obama will renominate Edward Chen to be judge, San Francisco Chronicle (January 9, 2010). On May 5, 2011, Senator Harry Reid received unanimous consent from the Senate to proceed to an executive session of the Senate at a future time, eliminating the need to file for cloture on Chen's nomination. On May 10, 2011, Chen was confirmed by a 56‚Äì42 vote. *United States District Court for the District of Arizona **Rosemary M√°rquez: On June 23, 2011, President Obama nominated Marquez, a Tucson defense attorney, to the federal court in Arizona. However, Arizona's two Republican senators, John McCain and Jon Kyl, refused to return their blue slips. McCain said that he did not believe that Marquez was qualified, telling a newspaper, \\"I've been working with Sen. Kyl, but we do not feel at this time that she's qualified.\\" On January 28, 2014, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on her nomination as well as five other individuals nominated to the same court. She was confirmed on May 15, 2014, by a vote of 81‚Äì15. *United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri **Ronnie L. White: On November 7, 2013, President Obama nominated Missouri Supreme Court Justice White to serve on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. White had previously been nominated for the same position by President Bill Clinton in 1997, but the nomination was defeated.https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress%253D106%2526session%253D1%2526vote%253D00307 The nomination drew controversy, as Republicans charged White as being a liberal ideologue who was biased in favor of criminal defendants. He received a hearing before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee on May 20, 2014. On June 19, 2014 his nomination was reported out of committee by a vote of 10‚Äì8. On July 16, 2014, the Senate voted 54‚Äì43 for cloture on White's nomination, ending a Republican-led filibuster. Later that same day, senators voted 53‚Äì44 to confirm White.  Effects of vacancies  A 2016 study found that the current rate of federal judicial vacancies (10 percent) had led prosecutors to dismiss more cases and had led defendants to be more likely to plead guilty and less likely to be incarcerated. The authors found that \\"the current rate of vacancies has resulted in 1,000 fewer prison inmates annually compared to a fully-staffed court system, a 1.5 percent decrease.\\" Nominations that were made at the end of Obama's term and later renominated=Successfully appointed renominees *United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida **William F.

The FMC was deeply involved in the 1961 Cuban Literacy Campaign and in supplying workers after the mass exodus of trained labor following the Revolution. A few of the stated goals of the FMC are: * Bringing Women out of the home and into the economy * Reorganizing peasant households that keep women in subservient positions * developing communal services to alleviate domestic work and childcare * providing equal opportunities for women * mobilizing women into political work and government administration * providing adequate working conditions \\"to satisfy the particular needs of the female organism and the moral and spiritual needs of women as mothers.\\"Harris, Colette, \\"Socialist Societies and the Emancipation of Women: The Case of Cuba. \\" Socialism and Democracy 9:1(1995)91-113. Print. FMC & The Cuban Literacy Campaign The Cuban Literacy Campaign was a national effort to eradicate illiteracy in Cuba following the 1959 Revolution. Shortly after the Revolution, motivated by patriotism and sustained by political will, Fidel Castro declared that illiteracy would be eradicated within 1 year. Accordingly, during 1959 and 1960 the groundwork was laid for a mass literacy campaign, La Alfabetizaci√≥n.McCall, Cecelia, \\"Women and Literacy: The Cuban Experience\\" Journal of Reading 30:4(Jan.,1987)318-324. Print. In the year leading up to the campaign, the FMC was charged with identifying illiterate women and convincing them to participate. During the campaign itself \\"figures indicate that more 91,000 women participated with the FMC in La Alfabetizaci√≥n. Thousands of women became teachers and other cared for the young boys and girls ages 11-16, who formed the Conrado Benitez Brigade.\\"McCall, Cecelia, \\"Women and Literacy: The Cuban Experience\\" \\"On December 22, 1961, when Cuba was declared a \\"territory Free of Illiteracy\\" 55% of the 700,000 new literates were women.McCall, Cecelia, \\"Women and Literacy: The Cuban Experience\\" FMC & The 1975 Family Code 1966 Fidel Castro made a speech in which he called for the addition of a million women to the labor force.Harris, Colette, \\"Socialist Societies and the Emancipation of Women: The Case of Cuba.\\" Many women responded to this and entered the work force only to leave again when the burden of family and work proved too difficult. During the 1970s many improvements were made that allowed women to return to work, daycare centers were opened and other services provided. But still women lagged men in the workforce, making up only 25% of the force. In 1975 the FMC made a nationwide inquiry to investigate the reasons behind this. The result of this inquiry was the Family Code of 1975. The code gave men and women equal rights and equal responsibilities in the home and increased state social services. Some of the unique outcomes of this code were that working women were to have first rights to buy appliances that saved time, cafeterias were opened in the work place and health clinics were kept open later. Plan Jaba gave working women shopping priority. They could drop off their bags at the store in the morning together with a shopping list and pick them up in the evening on the way home already filled.Harris, Colette, \\"Socialist Societies and the Emancipation of Women: The Case of Cuba.\\" Second National Congress of the Federacion de Mujeres Cubanas November 25‚Äì29, 1974 The second national congress is an example of the work of the FMC.

Further restrictions were established in the 1991 √âvin law,Law n¬∞91-32 of 10 January 1991 which contains a variety of measures against alcoholism and tobacco consumption. A much stronger smoking ban was introduced on 1 February 2007. Smoking in enclosed public places such as offices, schools, government buildings and restaurants is strictly prohibited. Law officials may enforce the laws with minimum fines set at ‚Ç¨500. History The Veil law is named after Simone Veil, the French activist health minister, who took an initiative to fight against tobacco smoking in France in 1976. Veil banned advertising for tobacco or tobacco products and required tobacco companies to print severe warnings on their cigarette packages, such as \\"Abus Dangereux ‚Äì [Overuse is Hazardous].\\" Another significant aspect of the Veil Law was to place limitations on smoking places affect√©s √† un usage collectif (open to the public). The √âvin law is named after Claude √âvin, the minister who pushed for it. The law leaves certain important criteria on what is allowed or not with respect to smoking sections to executive-issued regulations, and it is those regulations that were altered in 2007. A legal challenge against the new regulations was filed before the Conseil d'√âtat in 2007, but was rejected.Ruling of 19 March 2007 of the Conseil d'√âtat (copy on L√©gifrance) Under the initial implementation rules of the 1991 √âvin law, restaurants, caf√©s etc. just had to provide smoking and non-smoking sections, which in practice were often not well separated. In larger establishments, smoking and non-smoking sections could be separate rooms, but often they were just areas within the same room. Current status Smoking and vaping are banned in all indoor public places (government buildings, offices, public transport, universities, museums, restaurants, caf√©s, nightclubs, etc.). Caf√©s and shops selling tobacco-related products are submitted to the same regulations. No exceptions exist for special smoking rooms fulfilling strict conditions. Additionally, some outdoor public places also ban smoking and vaping (railway stations). As of 2015, 32% of French adults declare themselves to be regular smokers. In case of violation of tobacco laws, the smoker can face a fine of up to ‚Ç¨450 and the owner of the venue up to ‚Ç¨750. Plain packaging for cigarettes was introduced in 2017.

Ant√≥nio Rodrigo Pinto da Silva (Porto, 13 March 1912 ‚Äì Lisbon, 28 September 1992), often referred to as A.R. Pinto da Silva or P. Silva, was a Portuguese botanist who distinguished himself as a taxonomist and phytosociologist when he collaborated with Swiss botanist Josias Braun-Blanquet and also with Pierre Dansereau. His studies on taxonomy and floristic yielded a substantial number of new taxa and a better knowledge about many plants and its nomenclature. He organized the Esta√ß√£o Agron√≥mica Nacional's (National Agronomic Station) herbarium, which he rose from 3000 to almost 100,000 entries. He was a pioneer on ethnobotany studies in Portugal and published several contributions on vernacular nomenclature of Portuguese flora, cultivated plants and popular use of wild plants as food. For half a century he helped archaeologists, having published numerous works on paleoethnobotany, among more than 300 articles, notes and communications published throughout his life both in Portuguese and foreign publications.  Biography  A. R. Pinto da Silva was born in 1912 in the parish of Cedofeita at Porto. He graduated in agricultural engineering at Instituto Superior de Agronomia, Technical University of Lisbon in 1937. Married to biologist Quit√©ria of Jesus Gon√ßalves Pinto da Silva, they established Lisbon. In 1968 he became principal investigator at the National Agronomic Station, where he worked from 1937 to 1982, year of his retirement. Since its founding in 1939, he became head of the Phytosystematics and Geobotany departments, devoting himself to studies of flora and vegetation of mainland Portugal and also in the Azores. Besides the results of his activities, he sought to stimulate others in these and other fields of research, with considerable results.  Studies in taxonomy, floristics and ethnobotany  His studies in taxonomy and floristics yielded a substantial number of new taxa, among which stand out the Silene rothmaleri Pinto da Silva, Convolvulus Fernandes Pinto da Silva & Teles and Digitalis Heywoodii (Pinto da Silva & M. Silva), including new taxa for the flora of Portugal and the Azores and a better knowledge of the area of many plants and their nomenclature. Since 1958, despite the shortage of staff, he assembled a Phytochorion Atlas covering more than half the area of Portugal. He organized the herbarium of the National Agronomic Station, which under his action went from just over 3,000 to almost 100,000 entries. He also developed complementary collections (diaspore in Portuguese flora, paleoethnobotany, etc.) and miscellaneous files. He edited the Index Seminum and organized the service of exchange and registration of seeds of that station from 1939 to 1982. First with the help of the principal investigator eng. AN Telles, then as a member of the Technical Council of the League for the Protection of Nature, of which he was one of the founders, established the first lists of Portuguese botanical areas to protect. Regarding the vegetation, he began systematic studies of phytosociology in Portugal with the collaboration of the Swiss botanist Josias Braun-Blanquet, having studied various plant communities and associations as oak forest, rivers, woods, Quercus coccifera forests, dunes, salty, vegetation, limestone soils and ultramafic rocks, vineyards, meadows, pastures. In addition to the floristic and taxonomic research and phytosociology, he devoted to the naming of cultivated plants and botany nomenclature, having submitted numerous proposals for amendments to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature and intervening in the discussion and vote during the sessions of Nomenclature of the International Botanical Congress of Stockholm - where he represented the National Agricultural Station and the Botanical Institutes of Coimbra and Porto - and Paris, representing the National Agricultural Station. In that Congress was appointed to the Committee for Spermatophyta of which was part from 1950 to 1969 and who presided until requested excuse. Dedicated taxa Several taxon were dedicated to A.R.

Description The length of the forewings is 25 to 30 mm. This species shows an evident sexual dimorphism and the males are much more close to each other in appearance than the females. The wings of the males are usually dark brown on both surfaces, while in the female the wings are paler, with broad greyish bands on the undersides of the hindwings. On both sides of the forewings they have two-four black ocelli with white pupils, the first one much larger than the lower ones. The flight period extends from June to early September and the butterflies lay their eggs on the grass. The larvae are recorded as feeding on various grasses, including Stipa, Festuca, Bromus erectus and Deschampsia caespitosa. (Higgins, Riley, 1982) Distribution It is found in southern Europe, Morocco, Asia Minor, Iran, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, Transbaikal, western China and the Himalayas. Habitat This species prefers grassy, rocky areas, calcareous grasslands, forest clearings at an elevation of above sea level (up to 3000 m in North Africa).

Retrieved 19 November 2013 Bridget Smith (artist) Smith works within the documentary genre but she photographs places of fantasy and escapism. Smith is interested in the places where people go to seek refuge from the outside world: to escape boredom, to be diverted, transported, absorbed ‚Äì places to lose oneself, where pretence and reality are often confused. Smith's photographs have documented the construction of fantasy and the architecture of entertainment, the function of which is to disconnect people from their everyday lives and concerns. Since 2005 her practice has expanded to include both still and moving images which address our struggle to feel connected: within society, the landscape and the wider universe. The photographs and videos often point to the gap between one‚Äôs imagination and reality and the interplay between the two. The work flits between objectivity and subjectivity, the real and the fake. Education Smith graduated from Goldsmiths College, University of London in 1988 with a BA (Hons) in Fine Art.

Also at the '76 Brier, Richardson had to fill in for former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was due to be a guest speaker at the event. Since then, Richardson made a career of making speeches as a guest speaker. Richardson would also coach the Bob Ellert team at the 1981 Labatt Brier and the Garry Bryden team at the 1984 Labatt Brier. In 2005, Richardson was awarded with the Saskatchewan Order of Merit and he was made the Honorary Chair of the 2006 Tim Hortons Brier, also held in Regina. He is also a member of the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame and the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame.

The track was written by Russ Thomas, who provided vocals and played guitar, and was recorded at Horizon Studios, Coventry. The drummer was Mark Hatwood, formally of Coventry band Squad, which included Terry Hall in their line-up. Later Paul Tyler was added on bass and Steve Libby on keyboards. In 1980 Tyler left and Hatwood got disillusioned and joined Mud - later to write film music. Thomas and Libby carried on under the name of Metropolis, with Geoff Fulton on bass and Simon Phillips on drums. In 1981 Libby left to join The Agents, and then Force Majeure. Later in the year the rest of the band split up. Tyler continues composing and recording music involving Steve Libby on some of his work.

Earlier in his life, he had played for Uruguay in a rugby union international against Argentina, although the game was not one for which test caps were awarded. Early life Eric's was from a middle-class family from Northumberland. They had three children, Dorothy, James and Eric Arthur. Eric completed his education at Dulwich College, and immediately joined the Consular Service.Profile from www.cleugh.com Career Eric's career immediately took him across the Atlantic. He was to go to South, Central and North America. Amongst his postings were stints in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Havana. His work brought him into contact with Sir Winston Churchill and Lord Halifax and he reportedly became friends with Ernest Hemingway whilst in Cuba. During the Second World War, he was stationed in Los Angeles. He retired in 1955 as British Ambassador to Panama. Rugby union Eric Arthur had learnt rugby at Dulwich College, a school that already had a proud history in the sport. In 1922, the school magazine, The Alleynian, reported that a \\"Rugby International match [had been] played at Monte Video (Uruguay) between Argentine and Uruguay\\". The report went on to detail that the participants included \\"twenty public school boys\\", of whom \\"five were O.A's\\" (O.A. being an Old Alleynian, the term for a former pupil of Dulwich College). Despite five playing in the international, only four had won their 1st XV colours at Dulwich. The five former pupils named were C.H. Scott (1914‚Äì16) for Argentina, and L.P. Bridal (1914‚Äì18), Captain J.M. Cat (1909‚Äì15), E.A. Cleugh (1907‚Äì13), and C.E. Cat (1909‚Äì16) for Uruguay. Cleugh's former school mate, C.E. Cat, was at the time the captain of Argentina's premier team, Belgrano Club, but played for Uruguay because he was born in that country.Dulwich College Sporting Honours: Old Alleynians The match took place 26 years before Uruguay's first official match against Chile in 1948.

They are sexually dimorphic, as the females grow larger than the males. The overall colour is a tan brown through orange to red, with large, deep-brown or black stripes running from the rostral scale through the eye to the rear of the head, where they continue down the body. The eyes are large and the pupils are vertically elliptical. Behaviour and diet Little is known about this species because it is rather uncommon. It is nocturnal by nature and has been known to feed on small mammals and rodents. They breed at the beginning of the rainy season and are, it is assumed, an egg-laying species.

Named Clara at birth, she later used the form Clare and was also known as Tony. Atwood studied at Westminster School of Art and the Slade School of Fine Art. Atwood first exhibited at the New English Art Club in 1893, becoming a member in 1912. She held an exhibition of her work at the Carfax Gallery in 1912. In 1917, during World War I, she was commissioned to paint war scenes for the Canadian Government through the Canadian War Memorials Fund. The Fund arranged for Atwood to visit the military camp at Folkestone in Kent to gather ideas for the work. However, Atwood decided instead to paint a scene at one of London's main railway stations where troops were waiting for trains to take them to camps or to the front. During the war, Attwood was also commissioned by the Women's Work Sub- committee of the Imperial War Museum to produce several pieces depicting the activities of the Women's Voluntary Service. The most notable of these, Christmas Day at the London Bridge YMCA Canteen, records the visit of the actress Ellen Terry and Princess Helena Victoria to a YMCA canteen. In 1920 she was commissioned for four more war paintings by the Imperial War Museum.Cockin, Katharine \\"Atwood, Clare (1866‚Äì1962)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 12 March 2010  Personal life  Olympia in War Time by Clare Atwood from the IWM collection.

It had two kilns with eight chambers, initially producing sheet glass and later only bent glass, mostly for export. Gla≈æuta had the first steam boiler in Carniola, which was used to power a grinder. Most of the workers at the facility were German; judging by the surnames, there may have also been some Czech workers, but very few ethnic Slovenes. The glassworks ceased operations in 1855 or 1856, and a steam-powered sawmill was established at the site in 1870 or 1871. This was the first steam-powered sawmill in Gottschee. The settlement had five houses before the Second World War. The sawmill was destroyed during the war. During the Second World War, 10 prisoners killed a Partisan guard near Gla≈æuta and escaped.

Although the settlement was not listed in the Gottschee land registry of 1574 or in the 1770 census, it was mentioned by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor in 1689. In 1869 the village had 15 houses and a population of 78, and in 1880 a population of 89. No Slovene residents were recorded in the village until 1890. In 1931 Lazec had a population of 112, equally divided between ethnic Slovenes and Germans. The Gottschee German residents were evicted in November 1941, after which the Slovene population allied itself with the Partisans. On 11 August 1942, Italian forces transported all of the remaining men of the village to a concentration camp at Treviso. After the armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, two families moved to Lazec from Stari Kot and one from Novi Kot.

Notice the lack of any imagery except the cross. The miliaresion (, from ), was a name used for a number of Byzantine silver coins. In its most specific sense, it refers to a type of silver coin struck in the 8th‚Äì11th centuries. History Originally, the name was given to a series of silver coins issued in the 4th century that were struck 72 to the pound and were the equivalent of 1,000 nummi. Thereafter and until the 7th century, the Byzantines did not use silver coins. In the 7th century, miliaresion was the name given to the hexagram-type coins, and from circa 720 on for a new type, broader and thinner than the hexagram, instituted by the Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717‚Äì741)... This latter type, for which the term miliaresion is usually preserved among numismatists, were apparently struck 144 to the pound, with an initial weight of circa 2.27 grams, although in the Macedonian period that increased to 3.03 grams (i.e. 108 coins to the pound). In the first century of its issue, it appears to have been issued solely as a ceremonial coin on the occasion of the appointment of a co-emperor, and hence always features the names of two Byzantine emperors. Only from the reign of Emperor Theophilos (r. 829‚Äì842) did the coin become regular issue, struck throughout an emperor's reign.. The coins were inspired by the contemporary silver Islamic dirham, and in common with it (and unlike the Byzantine Empire's gold and copper coinage, or the earlier hexagram) featured initially no human representations, sporting instead the names and titles of the emperor or emperors on the reverse and a cross on steps on the obverse. In the 10th century, Emperor Alexander (r. 912‚Äì913) introduced a bust of Christ on the obverse, and Romanos I (r. 920‚Äì944) added an imperial bust to the center of the cross. This process culminated in the 11th century, when images of emperors, Christ, and the Virgin Mary began to appear.. In the 11th century, 2‚ÅÑ3 and 1‚ÅÑ3 fractions of the miliaresion also began to be minted, but the military and financial collapse of the 1070s‚Äì1080s affected its quality.. It was discontinued after 1092, except as a money of account equal to 1‚ÅÑ12 of the nomisma. Under the Komnenian emperors, it was initially replaced by a very low-grade billon trachy coin, initially worth a quarter of a miliaresion but later much devalued. The miliaresion was essentially revived in the form of the basilikon issued from circa 1300 onwards.. The name also passed into Western European languages, where milliar√®s was used for various kinds of Muslim silver coins.

Perkins was perhaps the first mulatto commissioned officer in the Royal Navy. He rose from obscurity to be one of the most successful ship captains of the Georgian navy. He captained a 10-gun schooner during the American War of Independence and in a two-year period captured at least 315 enemy ships. Later in his career Perkins acted for the navy as a spy and undertook missions to Cuba and Saint-Domingue (modern day Haiti). At the start of the slave revolt in Saint-Domingue he was captured in Cap-Fran√ßais and sentenced to death for supplying the rebel slave army with weapons. After his rescue he was promoted commander in 1797 and then post-captain in 1800. Perkins went on to cause an international incident with the Danes when he fired on two of their ships during peacetime. Toward the end of his career he participated in capture of the islands of Saint Eustatia and Saba from the French. Perkins also attacked a 74-gun ship-of-the-line with a 32-gun frigate. Early life and career John Perkins was probably born in Kingston, Jamaica in the middle of the 18th century. Very little is known of his birth or early life. One account written 30 years after his death described him as of mixed race. Donnithorne. At the time, mixed-race people typically became slaves like their black parent. But occasionally a mixed-race son of a prominent white man was acknowledged by his father and given an education to prepare him for a clerical or administrative career; this may have been the case with Perkins.Costello (2012), p. 97 In 1775 Perkins first appears in the records of the Royal Navy when he was appointed to the 50-gun , the flagship of the commander-in-chief of the Jamaica station as an extra pilot. \\"His knowledge of the different ports, &C.; in the West Indies was, perhaps, seldom equalled, and never surpassed.\\"Naval Chronicle, 27 (1812), pp. 351‚Äì352 In 1778 he was placed in command of the schooner Punch, a ship probably armed with ten 2 or 4-pounder guns, though no detailed records survive. At this time he received his nickname Jack Punch, most probably earned because of the name of his command. During the next two years Perkins claimed to have captured 315 ships, an average of three per week, a claim that was later endorsed by the Jamaican House of Assembly.Journals of the Jamaican house of assembly, 8 Admiral Sir Peter Parker, and subsequent admirals, used Perkins in clandestine missions against the French at Cap-Fran√ßais, a province in the South West of Saint- Domingue, and the Spanish in Havana, Cuba. Parker eventually commissioned Perkins as a lieutenant and gave him command of .ADM 51/4181 Captains' logs Endeavour 31 May 1776 ‚Äì 21 Feb 1781 The 12-gun EndeavourShips of the Royal Navy, Colledge, p.114. was an American-built schooner with a keel of 60 feet and beam of 20.Letter-Books and Order-Books of George, Lord Rodney, Admiral of the White Squadron, Volume 1. Page 230 Governor Archibald Campbell stated in a letter of recommendation that \\"By the gallant exertions of this officer some hundred vessels were taken, burnt, or destroyed, and above three thousand men added to the list of prisoners of war in favour of Britain; in short, the character and conduct of Captain Perkins were not less admired by his superior officers in Jamaica, than respected by those of the enemy.\\" In 1782 Perkins captured a much larger vessel containing several important French officers.Letter-Books and Order-Books of George, Lord Rodney, Admiral of the White Squadron, Volume 1. Page 490 The commander of the Jamaica station, Admiral George Rodney, promoted Perkins to master and commander of Endeavour, and added two guns to her raising her armament to fourteen guns, thus putting her on the official Navy List as a sloop-of-war.The Life and Correspondence of the Late Admiral Rodney. Godfrey Basil Mundy, p. 344,345Letter-Books and Order-Books of George, Lord Rodney, Admiral of the White Squadron, Volume 1. Page 511Letter-Books and Order-Books of George, Lord Rodney, Admiral of the White Squadron, Volume 2. 685 Rodney's promotion of Perkins was disallowed. Rodney wrote later to Philip Stephens, First Secretary to the Admiralty, in an attempt to confirm the promotion. \\"I must therefore desire you will please represent to their Lordships, that on my arrival at Jamaica, I found Mr. Perkins lieutenant and commander of the Endeavour schooner ‚Äì that he bore an excellent character, and had done great service.\\" Despite his request Perkins was demoted back to the rank of lieutenant and the guns ordered to be removed. At the end of the American War of Independence he was \\"on the beach\\" (meaning that he was without a posting on a ship) as a half-pay lieutenant. For several years between 1783 and 1790 Perkins disappeared from the books of the Royal Navy. It may be during this time that he turned to piracy as there is a French source and several English records that describe him as such.Lady Nugent's Journal of Her Residence in Jamaica from 1801 to 1805, Shepherd, p. 311,312Christophe: King of Haiti, Cole, p. 303 In 1790, fifteen years after he had first joined the navy, Perkins made an application to the Jamaican House of Assembly for their assistance in achieving his promotion. After presenting his certificates to the assembly, the assembly investigated Perkins‚Äô claim and resolved to make an application to the Admiralty for his promotion to post- captain. Capture on Saint-Domingue In 1790 Perkins volunteered once more and served under Admiral Philip Affleck. For several years there is no record that he held an official command but in 1792 Captain Thomas McNamara Russell of the 32-gun frigate , on a relief mission to the authorities on Saint- Domingue, was informed that a British officer was under arrest and due to be executed in J√©r√©mie for supplying arms to the rebel slaves. Officially Britain and France were not at war and Russell requested that Perkins be released. The French authorities promised that he would be and then later refused. After numerous letters had been exchanged Russell determined that the French had no intention to release Perkins. Russell sailed around Cap-Fran√ßais to J√©r√©mie and met with the 12-gun under Captain Nowell. It was agreed that Nowell's first lieutenant, an officer named Godby, would go ashore and recover Perkins whilst the two ships remained offshore within cannon shot, ready to land an invasion force if need be. Lieutenant Godby landed and after negotiations Perkins was released.Naval Chronicle, 17 (1807), pp. 458‚Äì462 Perkins then disappears once more from the records for a short time. Return to service In September 1793 Perkins returned to the books of the Navy. Perkins is listed as commanding , a 4-gun schooner. ADM 8/69 Admiralty Records held at the National Archives, Kew He accompanied Commodore John Ford's squadron when the British, at the request of French Royalists mounted a campaign against Saint- Domingue.The Royal Navy.

Ford described Perkins as \\"an Officer of Zeal, Vigilance and Activity.\\" In 1794 Marie Antoinette made up part of the squadron commanded by the newly promoted Rear-Admiral Ford that accompanied Brigadier- General John Whyte that briefly captured Port-au-Prince. At the time some forty five vessels lay in harbour and these were all made prizes. In 1796 Marie Antoinette made up part of a small squadron that captured the schooner Charlotte and brig Sally. Perkins remained with her until he was promoted master and commander.

Arab approached the two Danish vessels and, according to Danish accounts, without warning, fired several broadsides at Lougen before the Danish ship was able to return fire. Lougen, which had escaped serious damage, began to return fire steadily. Experiment initially attempted to capture Aarvaagne, but Aarvaagne obeyed orders to stay out of the fight and instead escaped south to Christiansted on St Croix with its intelligence on British actions. Experiment then joined Arab in the attack on Lougen, with the two British ships sandwiching the Danish ship. During the engagement, which lasted for over an hour, one of Lougens shots struck the Arabs cathead and loosed the bower anchor. (Perkin's reported that it was the first shot from Lougen that loosed the bower anchor.) Arabs crew was unable to cut the anchor free, leaving Arab unable to manoeuvre effectively. This allowed Jessen to steer a course that brought him under the protection of the shore batteries and then into St Thomas. Captain Jessen of the Lougen was awarded a presentation sword made of gold, a medal and 400 rixdollars (the equivalent of a whole year's salary for a Captain in the Danish Navy) by the Danish government for his actions. On 13 April 1801 Arab captured the Spanish privateer Duenda. Capture of Saint Eustatia and Saba Islands On 16 April 1801 Perkins, in company with Colonel Richard Blunt and a detachment of the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), laid siege to and captured the wealthy islands of Sint Eustatius and Saba, capturing their French garrisons, forty- seven cannon and 338 barrels of gunpowder.The Royal Navy.

After several further cruises Perkins was transferred in 1802 into the 32-gun frigate .Ships of the Royal Navy, Colledge, p.345 Later career Between 20 November and 4 December 1803 Tartar was in company with Commodore John Loring's squadron when the squadron captured the French ships of war Le Decouverte, La Clorinde, La Surveillante, La Vertu, and Le Cerf. La Surveillante and La Clorinde were bought into British service. La Surveillante had on board at her surrender General Rochambeau the commander of the French forces on Saint-Domingue. On 25 July 1804, while in company with under Captain James Walker, Tartar was involved in the capture of the French 74-gun ship of the line Duquesne, and two 16-gun brigs sailing with her. Tartar outsailed her larger companions and kept the Duquesne and her consorts engaged until the larger British ships came up and the French squadron surrendered.Naval History of Great Britain Vol. 3, James, p. 186National Archives, Kew: ADM 51/1447 Captains' logs Tartar 16 Apr 1802 ‚Äì 30 Apr 1804 A seaman's share of the prize money aboard the Tartar for the capture was 6 shillings and 8 pence. A petty officer's share was 1 pound, 13 shillings and 11 pence. Final mission to Haiti In January 1804 Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the commander of the slave rebellion in Haiti declared independence from France. Perkins was sent by Admiral Duckworth and Governor Nugent in Tartar as a British observer to the island. Perkins was accompanied by Edward Corbet. Corbet was a government advisor appointed by Nugent.Lady Nugent's Journal of Her Residence in Jamaica from 1801 to 1805, Shepherd Perkins described the situation on Haiti in his official letters to the Admiral. \\"I assure you that it is horrid to view the streets in different places stained with the Blood of these unfortunate people, whose bodies are now left exposed to view by the river and sea side. In hauling the seine the evening we came to our anchor several bodies got entangled in it, in fact such scenes of cruelty and devastation have been committed as is impossible to imagine or my pen describe.\\"Christophe: King of Haiti, Cole, pp. 140‚Äì143 Retirement and death In March 1804 Perkins resigned his commission on health grounds. It is rumoured that Perkins finally visited England in 1805 although there is no supporting evidence for this. There is no further record of his involvement with the Navy or Haiti. Perkins died on 27 January 1812 at his home in Jamaica. According to his obituary he suffered for many years with a condition described as \\"asthma\\" and that this was the cause of his demise. There is no record of a wife and the records concerning his estate have disappeared.

From 1990 to 1998 he served on the Senate Finance Committee. =Expulsion= The Maryland Senate expelled Young on January 16, 1998, for using his position to profit his private business. Young, who sat as chairman of the Health subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee, was also president of a private, for-profit health consulting firm called the LY Group. The ethics committee found that Young used his position and influence to leverage $10,000‚Äì99,000 into the LY Group. In addition, the committee found that Young solicited and accepted a number of gifts in violation of the ethics law, including a $24,800 1995 blue Lincoln Town Car. He was later acquitted of criminal bribery charges. In popular culture Young has since presented a talk radio show, and played a talk radio show host in the HBO drama The Wire. In an essay in the official series guide, The Wire: Truth Be Told, William Zorzi implies that the character of the corrupt and venal Maryland State Senator Clay Davis is patterned on Young. The details of Larry Young's false abduction report and the resulting political aftermath is described in David Simon's Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. In the book, it is implied that Young's false report was an attempted cover up for his own assault against a political aide, in an argument over Young's sexual advances against the aide's fiance.

Pick is recognised for his distinctive fusion of live-action and animation, and the fluid, painterly style of his film-making. Martyn Pick‚Äôs credits include the 2009 film The Age of Stupid as animation director; London 2012, the promotional film for the 2012 Olympics; and the celebrated BBC promotional trailers for the Euro 2004 soccer tournament; and the Budweiser 2001 NBA commercials. Martyn Pick studied film and fine art at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the crossover of painting and cinema has driven his work ever since. Animation work=Early works Early animated films such as \\"Spectres\\" (1987)\\"Taboo of Dirt\\" (1988) and \\"Signature\\"(BFIMartyn Pick on the BFI website New Directors Award 1990) were characterised by raw gritty charcoal drawing, wild fluid movement and brutal subject matter. At odds with dominant commercial cartoon style they were screened in art galleries, international film festivals and on television establishing his distinctive voice as an animator and filmmaker. In the 1990s working as a commercial director in Soho production companies Pick applied his style to many commercials, promos and TV idents. He began to introduce live-action performance, CGI and digital compositing into the expressionist flow of his animation. In the Channel 4 commissioned short film \\"PLAZA\\" (2000) which was screened at film festivals including London and Edinburgh he created a tension between a savage animation subconscious and the placid live action reality that it shatters. This led to the FilmFour commission \\"GREEN\\" which was his first pure live-action drama. \\"PLAZA\\" was also the basis of a commercial for Budweiser for the US which used the same abrasive mix of raw scratched animation corroding live-action. At the same time he directed six high profile sixty second commercials for the American corporation ADM through the agency FCB. These were a strong commercial application of all the experiments with integrating live action and CGI into fluid painterly hand animation. They received massive exposure on US networks and won the Gold Plaque for Animation at the Chicago Film Festival. Recent works In 2004 he directed his biggest ever job in the UK which was the BBC promotional trailers for the EURO 2004 tournament in which live- action of famous European footballers were treated in an eclectic mix of painterly styles. Soon after he completed his first live-action commercial for the UK. In 2006 he worked as animation consultant on Brett Morgens documentary feature Chicago 10. In 2007 he started work as animation director on Franny Armstrong's climate change documentary feature The Age of StupidMartyn Pick's intro to The Age of Stupid (Spanner Films, Passion Pictures). In this he blended live action, CGI and matte paintings with a painterly, cinematic look. This award winning film was released to intense media interest and acclaim in March 2009.Martyn Pick on The Age of Stupid official site In 2008 he was commissioned by Film London and the London Development Agency to make \\"London\\"Martyn Pick's promotional film commissioned by Film London and the London Development Agency a five-minute film celebrating the capitals edge and diversity in the run up to the 2012 Olympics. This made particular use of a technique he had developed in the test film \\"Blythborough\\" where he painted directly into live action footage using digital tools, making the digital manipulation of live action more direct and spontaneous. The resulting film produced by Th1ng was premiered at the Beijing Olympics.

Name The name Podplanina is derived from a prepositional phrase in which the noun has lost its case ending: pod 'below' + planina 'mountain pasture'. The name therefore means 'below the mountain pasture(s).' The semantics of the Gottschee German name Untrdaub…ô, derived from the name Unter der Alpe in the land registry of 1574, are identical. The standard German name, Alben, simply means 'mountain pastures', corresponding to the variant Slovene name Planina. The residents of Podplanina are referred to as Bre≈æani by the people of the Kotar area. History Podplanina was founded in the 16th century. The land registry of 1574 states that three farmers lived here, with two full farms and one three- quarters farm. Towards the mid-17th century Slovenes from the Bohinj area began settling the ƒåabar area.

It uses parts from the Saleen S7 and the Pagani Zonda. The company that produces it (Keating; formerly known as Barabus Sportscars Ltd) was founded by Tony Keating and is based in Bolton, Greater Manchester, England. The TKR features a twin turbo-charged 7.0L V8 petrol engine derived from the General Motors LS (LS7) series developing . According to Keating, it can accelerate from 0-60 in 2 seconds.

In 2010 the TKR was set to be the car of choice to break the blind land speed record. Unfortunately, the car crashed on a test run and was unable to break this record. Development Barabus TKR-1 in London at the British Motor Show in 2006 Barabus TKR The idea for a car with the attributes of the Barabus TKR was born in 1996. The project was formed in the Italian town of Colonnella and included a plan to import the drive system from a factory in Great Britain. Eventually, a prototype was placed on display at the 2006 British International Motor Show in London. The inaugural design of the car was inspired by the American Saleen S7 for its front section, and the Italian Pagani Zonda for its rear structure. At the time of its official release in mid-2006, the Barabus TKR was promoted as a supercar that could reach a top speed of , with the capacity to reach from a stationary position in 2 seconds. The TKR uses an eight-cylinder engine with capacity and is equipped with two turbochargers. The engine produces 1005 horsepower, which classifies it among the most powerful production cars in the world, including the Bugatti Veyron 16.4, Bristol Fighter T, and SSC Ultimate Aero. The interior of the TKR is made from a combination of fine leather and suede, while the accents are provided by materials (such as brushed aluminium or carbon fiber) combined with painted highlights.

The men are believed to have been Vikings executed by local Anglo-Saxons. The dismembered skeletons were discovered by archaeologists in June 2009, and their identity and approximate ages were later confirmed by forensic analyses. Although the immediate circumstances of the deaths is unknown, the event occurred at a time of conflict between the native Anglo-Saxons and Viking invaders, and it has been suggested that the Vikings had been captured during an attempted raid into Anglo-Saxon territory. Discovery of burial site In September 2008, archaeologists from Oxford Archaeology began excavating land along the route of the planned Weymouth Relief Road (A354 road) in advance of the ¬£87 million project, which was intended to improve access to Weymouth and the Isle of Portland in advance of the 2012 Summer Olympics sailing events held in Weymouth. The project had attracted significant controversy, as the road's route passes through a legally protected Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty that is of historical and ecological importance. The archaeological investigation was one of the largest carried out in Dorset for many years, covering an area of around . The archaeologists discovered a burial pit on Ridgeway Hill containing what turned out to be 54 dismembered skeletons and 51 skulls. The bodies had been thrown into the pit haphazardly but the severed heads had been piled up separately to one side. The pit was in a disused Roman quarry, used by the killers for convenience rather than specially dug for the purpose. It lay next to what was a main road and parish boundary in Anglo-Saxon times; such prominent locations were typically used for public executions. As the burial pit was just outside the main construction area for the relief road, the archaeologists were able to excavate it in detail over the course of three months without significantly disrupting the road project. Identifying the dead The 54 skeletons were all of males, almost all aged from their late teens to around 25 years old, with a handful of older individuals aged up to their fifties. They had all been killed at the same time with a large, very sharp weapon such as a sword. They had not been cleanly killed, as many of them had suffered multiple blows to the vertebrae, jawbones and skulls. One man had his hands sliced through, suggesting that he had attempted to grab the sword as it was being swung towards him. There were a total of 188 wounds visible on the skeletons, an average of four per individual, indicating that they had been the victims of severe violence before being killed. One man had had the top of his skull sliced off, exposing his brain. There may well have been more injuries to soft tissue, but this is not detectable from the skeletons. However, they had no obvious battle wounds and were most likely captives. Judging from the lack of any remains of clothing or other possessions, they had probably been naked when they were thrown into the pit. There are more bodies than skulls, suggesting that three of the heads ‚Äì perhaps of high-ranking individuals ‚Äì were kept as souvenirs or put on stakes. The executions were initially thought to have occurred around the time of the Roman conquest of Britain circa AD 43, but radiocarbon dating of the remains found that they dated to some time between AD 970 to 1025. An analysis of teeth from ten of the skeletons was carried out by the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory, part of the British Geological Survey. This found that the men had come from Scandinavia, with one thought to have come from north of the Arctic Circle, and had eaten a high protein diet comparable with human remains found at known sites in Sweden. Chemical evidence from the bones indicated that they had eaten diets of mixed geographical origins, suggesting that they had migrated around northern Europe. Their physical features were also very similar to Scandinavian populations of the time and the physique of some of them indicated that they were possibly warriors. One man had filed grooves into his front central upper incisors, a possible indication of warrior status that has been observed in Scandinavian burials. However, the men were not all in good physical condition. One had suffered from a painful and disabling suppurating leg wound since childhood, which would have significantly slowed him and his group. Another had a deformed right leg as a result of a fractured femur. Explanations for the executions The dead men were all of fighting age and were killed a long way from home. Several theories have been advanced for how they ended up at Ridgeway Hill. At the time of their deaths, England was the scene of conflict between native Saxons and invading Vikings. It was initially suggested that the men might have been Saxons killed by Vikings or by other Saxons, but this was disproved by the evidence of their Scandinavian origins. The site of the burial is thought to have been a formal spot, and it is possible the execution may have taken place in front of an audience. In the National Geographic documentary Viking Apocalypse, Dr Britt Baillie has suggested that the executions may have been linked to the St. Brice's Day massacre, or that the Viking men were executed by their own kind for defection. However, the crudeness of the execution method and the large number of victims suggests that the event was not part of officially sanctioned criminal justice.
