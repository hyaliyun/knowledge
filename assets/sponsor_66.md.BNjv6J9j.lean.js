He was one of the sons of Mukhtiyar Kaji Damodar Pande. He served as the Prime Minister for two terms, serving 1837‚Äì1837 (First Term) and 1839‚Äì1840 AD (Second Term). He became powerful after Bhimsen Thapa was arrested, and was declared Mukhtiyar and Commander in Chief. He was a grandson of Kaji Kalu Pandey who was the commander of King Prithvi Narayan Shah and the Mulkaji of Gorkha and a notable figure during the unification campaign of Nepal. The death of Queen Tripurasundari in 1832, who was a distant cousin of Rana Jang and the strongest supporter and niece of Bhimsen Thapa, and the adulthood of King Rajendra, weakened Bhimsen Thapa's hold on power. The conspiracies and infighting with rival courtiers (especially the Pandes, who held Bhimsen Thapa responsible for the death of Damodar Pande in 1804) finally led to imprisonment of Bhimsen Thapa and death by suicide in 1839. However, the court infighting did not subside with his death, and the political instability eventually paved way for the establishment of the Rana dynasty. Rise to Power Rana Jang Pande was stationed as a captain in the army in Kathmandu. He was aware of the disunity between the Samrajya Laxmi and Bhimsen, and thus he had secretly expressed his loyalty to Samrajya Laxmi and had vowed to help her in bringing Bhimsen Thapa down for all the wrongs he had committed against his family. Factions in the Nepalese court had also started to develop around the rivalry between the two queens, with the senior queen supporting the Pandes, while the junior queen supporting the Thapas. About a month after Mathabar's return to Kathmandu, a child was born out of an adulterous relationship between him and his widowed sister-in-law. This news was spread all over the country by the Pandes, and the resulting public disgrace forced Mathabar to leave Kathmandu and reside in his ancestral home in Pipal Thok, Borlang, Gorkha. To save face, Bhimsen gave Mathabar the governorship of Gorkha. Taking advantage of Mathabar's absence in Kathmandu, the military battalions under his command were distributed to other courtiers during the annual muster at the beginning of 1837. Nevertheless, Bhimsen managed to secure his and his family members' positions in the civil and military offices. An investigation was also started to check Bhimsen's expenditures in establishing various battalions. Such events led the courtiers to feel that Bhimsen's Mukhtiyari (prime ministership) would not last very long; thus Ranabir Singh Thapa, in the hopes of becoming the next Mukhtiyar (Prime Minister), wrote a letter to the King asking him to be recalled to Kathmandu from Palpa. His wish was granted; and Bhimsen, pleased to see his brother after many years, made Ranbir Singh the acting Mukhtiyar and decided to go to his ancestral home in Borlang Gorkha for the sake of pilgrimage. But in truth, Bhimsen had gone to Gorkha to placate his nephew and bring him back to Kathmandu. In Bhimsen's absence, Rajendra established a new battalion, Hanuman Dal, to be kept under his personal command. By February 1837, both Ranjang Pande and his brother, Ranadal Pande, had been promoted to the position of a Kaji; and Ranjang was made a personal secretary to the King, while Ranadal was made the governor of Palpa. Ranjang was also made the chief palace guard, the position formerly occupied by Ranbir Singh and then Bhimsen. Thus, this curtailed Bhimsen's access to the royal family. On 14 June 1837, the King took over the command of all the battalions put in charge to various courtiers, and himself became the Commander-in-Chief. Mission to China In December 1835, the political rival of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa had requested Chinese Amban's in Lhasa to request King Rajendra Bikram Shah to send Kaji Rana Jang Pande as the leader of the 10th quinquennial mission to China.Chitta Ranjan Nepali, General Bhimsen Thapa Ra Tatkalin Nepal, Kathmandu: Ratna Pustak Bhandar, Third Edition, 2035 B.S., pp 206-207 As a result, the Chinese Amban wrote to the Nepalese King to personally nominate the leader of the next five-year mission to Peking. The Chinese Amban strongly suggested that Rana Jang Pande be appointed leader of the mission. King Rajendra Bikram Shah nominated Chautariya Pushkar Shah instead of Rana Jang Pande.Ludwig F. Stiller, The Silent Cry, Kathmandu: Sahayogi Prakashan, 1976, p 23 One source however states that the Chinese Amban had also suggested King Rajendra not to send wicked Rana Jang Pande, but to nominate another good, virtuous person to lead the quinquennial mission to the Ching Emperor's Court.Chinese Amban to King Rajendra, Tao Kwang 16th Year (1839 B.S., Magha 21, MFA, Pako No Pa. 64 Despite this, Jagat Bam Pande was originally supposed to lead the 1837 mission.Bhim Bahadur Pande Chhetri, Rastra Bhakti Ko Jhalak:Pande Bamsa Ko Bhumika, 1596-1904 B.S., kathmandu: Ratna Pustak Bhandar, 2034 B.S, P. 156 After Chautariya Pushkar Shah left for Peking there was a big political upheaval in Nepal with the dismissal and imprisonment of the Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa. Bhimsen Thapa held the post of Prime Minister continuously for thirty one years. The Nepalese court informed the Chautariya about the political developments in Nepal and dispatched him a letter to hand over to the Ching Emperor. Due to the political turmoil in Nepal, the Chautariya tried to complete his mission and return to Nepal as early as possible. He completed the round-trip journey to Peking in less than fourteen months. The mission of 1837 recorded a detailed and systematic summary of the routes from Kathmandu to Peking as traveled by the Nepalese envoy to Peking.B.H. Hodgson, \\"Route of Two Nepalese Embassies to Peking with Remarks on the watershed and plateau of Tibet\\", Journal of Asiatic Society, No VI, 1856, pp 486-490 Hold on power Portrait of Rangnath Paudel Immediately after the incarceration of the Thapas, a new government with joint Mukhtiyars was formed with Ranga Nath Poudyal as the head of civil administration, and Dalbhanjan Pande and Rana Jang Pande as joint heads of military administration. This appointment established the Pandes as the dominant faction in the court, and they started to make preparations for war with the British in order to win back the lost territories of Kumaon and Garhwal. While such war posturing was nothing new, the din the Pandes created alarmed not just the Resident Hodgson but the opposing court factions as well, who saw their aggressive policy as detrimental to the survival of the country. After about three months in power, under pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Ranajang as Mukhtiyar and Ranga Nath Poudyal, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole Mukhtiyar. Fearful that the Pandes would re-establish their power, Fateh Jung Shah, Ranga Nath Poudyal, and the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi Devi obtained from the King the liberation of Bhimsen, Mathabar, and the rest of the party, about eight months after they were incarcerated for the poisoning case. Some of their confiscated land as well as the Bagh Durbar was also returned. Upon his release, the soldiers loyal to Bhimsen crowded behind him in jubilation and followed him up to his house; a similar treatment was given to Mathabarsingh Thapa and Sherjung Thapa. Although pardon had been granted to Bhimsen, his former office was not re-instated; thus he went to live in retirement at his patrimony in Borlang, Gorkha. However, Ranga Nath Poudyal, finding himself unsupported by the King, resigned from the Mukhtiyari, which was then conferred on Pushkar Shah; but Puskhar Shah was only a nominal head, and the actual authority was bestowed on Ranjang Pande. Sensing that a catastrophe was going to befall the Thapas, Mathabar Singh Thapa fled to India while pretending to go on a hunting trip; Ranbir Singh Thapa gave up all his property and became a sanyasi, titling himself Swami Abhayananda; but Bhimsen Thapa preferred to remain in his old home in Gorkha. The Pandes were now in full possession of power; they had gained over the King to their side by flattery. The senior queen had been a firm supporter of their party; and they endeavored to secure popularity in the army by promises of war and plunder. Decline from power Portrait of Mathabar Singh Thapa in National Museum of Nepal, Chhauni Mathabarsingh Thapa, who was exiled to India when Bhimsen Thapa was supposedly found to be guilty of murdering the King Rajendra's son who was 6 months old, was asked to return to Nepal by the queen. Mathabarsingh Thapa arrived in Kathmandu Valley in 1843 April 17 where a great welcome was organized for him. After consolidating his position, he successfully led to the murder of all his political adversaries Karbir Pande, Kulraj Pande, Ranadal Pande, Indrabir Thapa, Ranabam Thapa, Kanak Singh Basnet, Gurulal Adhikari and many others, in several pretexts. The second queen of Rajendra, Queen Rajya Laxmi declared him Minister and Commander-In-Chief of the Nepalese army in 1843 December 25 believing he would help to usurp the power from Rajendra, her own husband, and make her own son, Ranendra as the king of Nepal. Death Rana Jang Pandey was forced to see the murdered dead bodies of his brothers and nephews on April 18, 1843. Rana Jang lying ill in his bed was not given death sentence. Rana Jang was shocked to death after seeing the dead bodies of his brothers and nephews on 18 April 1843.

It is also dubbed as the almighty Android button. A Kickstarter campaign was launched in August 2013 to raise funds for Pressy. The campaign ended on October 15 with a total of $695,138 pledged. The devices were expected to be shipped out by April 2014, but Pressy was delayed and released in July 2014.  Background = Funding  The Kickstarter campaign of Pressy was launched on August 29, 2013 with a stated goal of securing a funding of $40,000 in 47 days. After being featured on multiple blogs and media outlets, the Kickstarter campaign went viral. Pressy surpassed the $40,000 goal in less than 24 hours and acquired more than four-times of its goal in two days. The campaign closed on October 15 with a total of $695,138 pledged from 28,818 backers. For a $17 pledge, donors were offered the button and the application, and for a pledge of $25, a choice of colors with a keyring storage sheath was offered. Those who pledged $45 would receive a gold-coated Pressy button with a matching keyring holder. A special pledge of $1000 was available for developers that would allow them API implementation. By the end of the campaign, there was only one backer for the $1,000 pledge.  Development  Pressy was developed by Nimrod Back and Boaz Mendel. According to Back, he came up with the idea of Pressy after having developed several applications in 2013 and \\"noticing that my awesome devices are lacking the most intuitive input ‚Äì a button click.\\" Back then quit his day job of an application developer, teamed up with his friend Boaz Mendel, a product designer, and started working on the development of the Pressy. During the development of the device, the team grew to include a usability experience specialist, and a web developer. By late 2013, the team had many working prototypes and models of the button, all of which were made using 3D printing. Device  Pressy can be plugged into a phone's headphone socket. The button links with the Pressy application and when pressed can be used to access various functions in the phone. The application works by running on Android as a background service. The application monitors the headset jack, but only operates when Pressy is clicked. Pressy is available in four colors - black, blue, red, and white. The device comes with a key-ring carrier that can be used to keep the device when not being used. Pressy application can also be accessed through the media button on headphones when headphones are plugged into the phone.  Compatibility  The application is only available for Android. According to Back, they will not release an iOS application for Pressy due to restrictions on the API. However, in an interview, he said that \\"We hope our developers community builds an app compatible with iOS.\\" Pressy can work on any device running Android 2.3 or newer.  Features  The button is configured so that different actions are implemented following different rhythms or durations of the click. To add an action, a user clicks the plus sign in the Pressy app, selects the action type, customizes the click length and sequence, and then customizes the action. Pressy can be set to perform multiple functions by defining what happens with single or double  In the media When the Kickstarter campaign of Pressy was launched in August 2013, it was featured in multiple publications and technology blogs. The Next Web wrote \\"Early adopters snapped up all the Pressy buttons available for $15, making $17 the lowest tier you can get in on the deal.\\" Pressy was featured in 10 Kickstarter Projects You will be Buying in 2014 in Tech Radar. The article also mentioned that one of Tech Radar's employees had bought the button. Pressy was also featured in Five start-ups that are set to launch some crazy gizmos in 2014 in Indiatimes.  Controversy The Pressy team initiated a design change to the Pressy key- chain holder after the project was funded, which evoked mixed response among the backers. On June 4, 2014, a customer service representative for Pressy posted on the company's Facebook page that the companion application would not be offered through the Google Play store and would need to be sideloaded. The news contradicted prior promises made to Kickstarter Backers that the application would be available through the Google Play store, and backers voiced their concern on Pressy's social media outlets. Pressy would later state that the representative made an error, and stated that the application would be offered through the Google Play Store as previously reported, attaching photos of pre-printed packages containing the Google Play logo as a proof.

As such, Truman's connections to Pendergast going back to his 1922 candidacy for judge in Jackson County were a liability in the campaign. Missouri Governor Lloyd C.

History During the period 1100 to 1600 the western Latin Church developed a comprehensive theology of charity and what came to be known as Purgatory. In Scotland together with England and Wales, different traditions developed in the provision of care for the elderly, the sick and the dying. In Scotland hospitals provided a number of functions: Travellers‚Äô rest, care homes for elderly men and women; and sub-monastic prayer communities. Hospitals such as Bishop Dunbar‚Äôs Hospital in Old Aberdeen were in part prayer communities and in part care homes. Most hospitals or maison Dieu had a place or room set aside as a chantry chapel, or an oratory. In the Kincardine O‚ÄôNeil Hospital, the situation on a drove road offered a travellers‚Äô rest as well as a care and prayer community. Cowan et al. provide details of some 165 hospitals that offered all or some of these functions. In England, similar conditions from the early to late medieval period applied. In addition to care for the elderly, the church in Scotland and England became dominated by what might be called a theology of care for the elderly, The theology and practice of purgatory came to dominate the church and the country as a whole. Across the Western world charity and purgatory became the two themes that were often in conflict. Bedehouses and hospitals were founded to meet the requirements of charity and purgatory. In response to this theology individuals often made provision for their after-life by endowing priests and others to say what became known as the Requiem Mass. The chantry became the place where such masses where said. Chantries owe their name and function of providing an endowment or place for the maintenance of priests to sing daily mass for the souls of founders.See http://www.ewelmealmshousecharity.org/history.html for details of an important almshouse and chantry foundation. In some cases altars or chapels in churches were endowed in this fashion. In Scotland Bishop Dunbar, in the months before he died in 1532, founded a \\"chantry\\" or chapel in Elgin Cathedral in memory of his father and mother. The mortification records his wishes and obligations as follows: Howard Colvin provides a definitive account of the origins of chantries in England. Further evidence of their Anglo-Norman origins is provided by David Crouch. Colvin summarizes the situation as follows: In general functions provided in chantries where they were separate establishments ‚Äì e.g. Noseley, St Anne's Chapel in Barnstaple, Devon and Lincoln Cathedral were the same as those provided in many of the medieval hospitals and bedehouses in Scotland.

The historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Description The district includes three buildings, the most prominent of which are the town hall and the Chester C. Corbin Public Library. The first building to be built, however, is the school building located on Negus Street behind town hall. Originally named Bartlett High School, the two story Colonial Revival brick building was built 1903-5, and significantly renovated and extended in 1927-28, at the time of the town hall's construction. The building has features of both Colonial and Classical Revival, including a hip roof with gable dormers, a denticulated cornice with a wide frieze, and originally had a cupola on top. The school was renamed the Anthony J. Sitkowski School in 1979, and closed in 2005. It has since been converted to provide senior housing. The town hall was built in 1927-28 to a design by Michael Dyer and Company, whose later work included several other notable municipal buildings in Massachusetts. The 2.5 story brick building is laid in Flemish bond, with paneled concrete corner quoins. Like the school, it has a hip roof, denticulated cornice, and wide frieze. The school's cupola was moved to top the town hall at this time, and the work done at this time included construction of an auditorium that joined the town hall and school together. The library The Chester C. Corbin Public Library building was built in 1920. It is predominantly Craftsman in its styling, although it includes Classical Revival details, particular in its entrances, which have columns and pilastered porticos framing them. The building has a low hip roof with extended eaves, in typical Craftsman style, as is its masonry-and-brick exterior. Construction of the library was made possible by a bequest from Mrs. Chester C. Corbin in 1918; it was designed by New York architect Edward Lippincott Tilton, who was already noted nationwide for is design work on other municipal libraries. Soldiers' Monument In addition to the three buildings, the historic district includes several war memorials, most notably the 1907 Soldiers' Monument, dedicated to the town's Civil War soldiers. Near the memorial stand two Civil War-era howitzers. A second memorial, begun in 1953, commemorates the town's Korean and Vietnam War veterans.

The party platform focuses on four main issues: secularism, women's rights, democracy, and opposition to NATO's Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. The party is strongly critical of the Afghan government, which it views as corrupt, fundamentalist, and dominated by warlords. The party claims a membership of some 30,000. History The party boycotted the 2005 and 2010 parliamentary elections. The party was suspended in June 2012 following a Kabul demonstration in late April 2012 where the party accused a number of Afghan leaders, including former leaders and commanders, of committing war crimes over the last three decades of conflict, and demanded they be brought to justice. The SPA boycotted the 2004, 2009, and 2014 Afghan Presidential elections as the party alleges that an individual cannot be elected without the approval of the US government. The party does, however, take part in provincial elections as it believes these elections to be more democratic and harder for central government to control or rig. No SPA members ran in the 2013 provincial elections, although the party did support certain candidates. The party condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north- eastern Syria.

Admission is free. The collection and facilities are managed by High Life Highland on behalf of Highland Council. Inverness Museum and Art Gallery The original Inverness Museum opened in 1881 and began to develop as a Highland and Jacobite collection. One of the important early additions was a group of historic Stuart portraits donated by the family of Prince Frederick Duleep Singh, including a portrait of Prince Charles Edward Stuart attributed to Pompeo Batoni and a Cromwell that Prince Freddy hung upside down. Subsequent additions to the collection include examples of Highland landscapes by Scottish artists including Alexander Nasmyth, John Quinton Pringle and Tom Scott. The Castle Wynd/Bridge Street area of Inverness was cleared for re-development in 1963 and the current complex was built. Since 1963 there have been a two major redevelopments to improve the museum: the first in 1982 to incorporate a caf√©, new permanent galleries and temporary exhibition/art galleries, and again in 2006 it was closed for six months to allow a ¬£1.3m makeover, with the re-design completed in time for Highland 2007. The Museum presents history and heritage in the Capital of the Highlands. On the ground floor you will find Scottish geology and natural history as well as the archaeology of the Highlands including Pictish stones. The displays continue on the first floor with the more recent history of the Highlands ‚Äì Jacobite memorabilia, Inverness silver, Highland weapons and bagpipes. The first floor features a programme of temporary exhibitions. This Puma was captured in Inverness-shire in 1980.

Owned and operated by the state-owned telecommunications provider T√ºrksat company, it is situated in G√∂lba≈üƒ± district of Ankara Province in Turkey. The earth station was established in 1994 for servicing Turkey's first communications satellite T√ºrksat 1B launched on August 11 that year. For the location of its backup facility, the campus of Middle East Technical University (ODT√ú) was chosen, about away. The ground station consists of equipment such as and parabolic antennas of high reliance, electronic devices, data processing system and uninterrupted power supply unit for telecommunication with the T√ºrksat 1C, 2A 3A satellites currently in orbit. The backup station has a antenna available. The facility features, in full backup, a satellite control center, an observation and control center, a communications observation center and a data encryption center. Further, a satellite simulator provides training for the operators, which is also used for approval purposes of procedures to be applied on the spacecraft. Since the ground station in G√∂lba≈üƒ± is capable of servicing three satellites at a time only, it is projected to expand its capacity with regard of the launch of T√ºrksat 4A satellite in 2014. The construction of a backup ground station in Konya is planned. Earthquake risk On December 20, 2007, an earthquake of 5.7 magnitude occurred in Bal√¢, Ankara, about far from G√∂lba≈üƒ± Ground Station. Although the ground station was not effected by the earthquake, the incident showed the possible risk of telecommunication blackout and loss of satellites in orbit in case of an earthquake. Due to proximity of the backup facility to the ground station, the earthquake risk is much high. It is required that the backup facility's location should be at least away. A report states that when the link between the spacecraft and the earth station is interrupted for a period of 48 hours, the re-establishment of the link is unlikely.

Just as they discover how perfect they are for each other, Alex disappears. Danny finds Alex's body.

In the U.S., it premiered on BBC America starting 21 January 2016. In 2018 it was carried on Netflix.

Gabriel Tate of The Daily Telegraph wrote: \\"London Spy, has been adored and abhorred. Its ambition has delighted and infuriated, its obfuscation has intrigued and frustrated. It is, if nothing else, a singular vision...\\" A.A. Gill of The Sunday Times wrote: \\"This is a strange, inexplicably compelling story. There are vast lacunas in the plot, filled with the unblinking performance of Ben Whishaw, made more memorable because most of it is done without words. Everyone else revolves around him, but he remains essentially a hole at the centre of the doughnut. It is a characterisation of great depth, in a plot that is nothing more than a series of enigmas, presented enigmatically.\\" Jack Searle in The Guardian called it an \\"intoxicating series\\" with \\"a beguiling emotional aesthetic.\\" \\"It was inevitable that, when prosaic explanation finally had to intrude on all this elliptical artistry, the spell was partly broken. A thriller hasn't so boldly made the genre beautiful since The Shadow Line. London Spy has lived in the gap between plot and subtext ‚Äì between what it's about, and what it's really about. It's really about self-knowledge, and how lovers try to know each other while lying about themselves.\\" Following the screening of the final episode, Gabriel Tate wrote in The Guardian that the series had \\"a somewhat daft and implausible ending, but there was still much to enjoy, mostly from the brilliant Ben Whishaw.\\" Benji Wilson in The Daily Telegraph called it \\"wonderful and infuriating in equal measure..Has there ever been a television series that's frustrated as much as London Spy (BBC 2)? Over five weeks this contemporary thriller has scaled giddy heights and then plumbed ludicrous depths, gone from being completely gripping to turgid as hell, thrown up single scenes of startling brilliance then followed them with some preposterous self-indulgence... London Spy potentially great script was in desperate need of some doughty editing.\\" The Guardian Mark Lawson named the series one of the best shows of 2015.

Designed by Ole Nielsen of Lyngby, the building of dark red brick with a red-tiled roof was completed in 1969. Background The process leading to a decision on the church's construction dragged on for decades. As far back as the 1920s, the church committee of the Church of Our Saviour had discussed building a church to be named R√∏rkj√¶r Church near R√∏rkj√¶ar School southeast of the town centre. Matters were delayed after Jerne Parish was incorporated into Esbjerg Municipality, as well as by the Second World War (1940‚Äì1945). Further delays occurred when the congrational committee of Zion's Church discussed and finally decided to build Trinity Church (completed in 1961) in the east area of the town. Nevertheless, a competition was arranged in 1957, with Ole Nielsen submitting one of the 130 proposals but no decision was made owing to financial difficulties caused by inflation. In 1966, after it became easier to obtain a building loan, Nielsen's offer was accepted and the foundation stone was laid. The new parish was separated from Trinity Parish (Vor Frelsers Sogn) and the church was consecrated in 1969. Architecture The complex consists of the church itself with parish rooms to the west surrounding a courtyard. There is also a closed courtyard with a funeral chapel. The rectangular nave flanking Grundtvigs All√© with an altar to the north is completed by a low transverse tower behind the altar wall. The church's V-shaped roof rises towards the tower while a short area of roofing covers the organ loft at the south end. Inside, the large wall surfaces are broken only by 12 narrow windows on the east side, creating a contrast with the much brighter tower room which opens into the chancel with light entering from a window high on the east side of the tower. The steeply inclined ceiling is of untreated boarding. The floor, which falls towards the slightly raised altar, is paved with white Italian marble tiling. The altar and pulpit are brick. There is a simple wooden cross above the altar which is decorated as the Tree of Life. The font is a solid granite block. The organ from 1971 was made by Frobenius & Sons, Lyngby. It has 18 stops, three manuals and a pedal.

He was recognized as one of the leading engravers of his day. He collaborated with Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres on several works. Life Charles-Simon Pradier came from a family of refugees from Languedoc. He was born in Geneva in 1786. His brother was the sculptor Jean- Jacques Pradier (1790-1852), better known as James Pradier. He was a pupil of Auguste Gaspard Louis Desnoyers, who was in turn a pupil of Pierre Alexandre Tardieu (1756-1844). He was to become one of the most distinguished engravers of his day. He became a member of the Drawing Committee of the Soci√©t√© des Arts in 1812, but was not active in it since he usually lived in Geneva. Disembarkation of her royal highness, the archduchess Carolina Leopoldina (1818) Pradier was a member of the Miss√£o Art√≠stica Francesa organized by Joachim Lebreton which brought a number of artists to Brazil, arriving on 25 March 1816. These included the painters Jean-Baptiste Debret (1768-1848) and Nicolas-Antoine Taunay (1755-1830), the sculptor Auguste Marie Taunay (1768-1824), the brothers Marc Ferrez (1788-1850) and Zepherin Ferrez (1797-1851) and the architect Grandjean de Montigny (1776-1850). They were to form the nucleus of a royal art academy in Brazil. Pradier left Brazil in 1818 and returned to Paris. He claimed that in Brazil there was no appropriate paper for printing his works. In 1825 Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres gave Pradier permission to make a print of his painting of Virgil reading the Aeneid to the Emperor Augustus. Ingres introduced changes, and made a drawing in 1830 that seems to have been the version copied by Pradier. Pradier won the cross of the Legion of Honour for this engraving. Later Ingres created a smaller version of his Antiochus and Stratonice for engraving by Pradier, but the project was eventually abandoned. Pradier returned to Geneva in 1847 in failing health. He died nearby at Mornex on 21 July 1847. Pradier's last work was Jesus giving the keys to Saint Peter, after a painting by Ingres, on which he worked for seven years. The engraving was exhibited in Geneva in August 1847.

Research  The physics of condensed matter is addressed in all its diversity, but the current activities can be loosely divided into three main topics, each one involving about thirty permanent researchers: # New electronic states of matter # Physical phenomena with reduced dimensions # Soft matter and physics-biology interface Topic 1: theoretical and experimental studies, related to the properties of correlated fermions (superconductivity, magnetism, metal- insulator transition, and so on). Topic 2: studies related to ‚Äúnanosciences‚Äù, broadly speaking. They are approached from the point of view of fundamental properties, and cover the situation when the size of an object becomes comparable to certain characteristic scales (coherence length, mean free path,...) Topic 3: studies of ‚Äúsoft matter‚Äù including biological systems. Topics range from complex systems to living tissues, from liquid crystals to foams, passing through polymers or granular systems. These studies are often done at the interface with physical chemistry and biology.  Teaching  The faculty (but also the CNRS researchers) are actively involved in various undergraduate and graduate courses and programs aimed at students of the Orsay and Paris universities and at students of engineering schools (‚ÄúGrandes √âcoles‚Äù).

He has said that this comes from the time in his life when he spent a lot of time near the sea. Crediting his father for his love of music, he is a self-taught musician; his family was too poor for him to be able to take music lessons. As well as playing the guitar, he taught himself how to play the harmonica and the piano. As he grew up, he found most of the music that was around in the Chinese music scene, meaningless; however, inspired by the music of Lo Ta-Yu (ÁΩóÂ§ß‰Ωë) from Taiwan, whose writings he found more meaningful, he started to write his own songs and, in 1982, wrote his first song, Discard (Êäõ).

History  When the Richmond Town Association F.C., which had developed from the Old Boys team of the British School in Richmond, Surrey, failed financially after undertaking a tour of France, two members, brothers Bob and Horace Alaway, formed a successor club, Richmond Town Wanderers, in 1905 with the initial intention of a farewell tour. However, the club flourished, pursuing its mission of spreading football to countries where it was less developed than in England. By 1912, it had affiliated to the Middlesex County Football Association, adopted the name Middlesex Wanderers, and had begun to restrict membership of its touring teams to players with county representative honours or better. The club's constitution set out its remit as: :To promote a good fellowship among football clubs and other sporting organisations throughout the world. :To send teams of British footballers on tours abroad. :To play occasional football games in the British Isles and such other games as the Executive Committee may approve. Wanderers' 50th tour, to Turkey in 1939, made them the first British club to visit that country; the team included international players from Wales and Ireland as well as England. They played a match with Fenerbah√ße as part of that club's jubilee celebrations. Although the intention had been to remain in Istanbul, they responded to popular demand and also visited the capital, Ankara. On their return, Horace Alaway wrote to the Times commending the positive attitude of the Turkish people towards Britain, suggesting that efforts be made to strengthen business and industrial links, and pointing out that \\"Turkey has shrewd and intelligent leaders, but they need help and friendship, and they are looking to Britain more than to any other country\\". The club co-operated with the Football Association (the FA) in undertaking a tour to the West Indies with a team comprising probables and possibles for selection for the 1960 Olympics in Rome. Norman Creek, who was to manage the British team, was liaison officer on the tour so was able to assess his potential players, who in turn were able to accustom themselves to the hotter temperatures and harder, drier pitches that they could expect in Italy. Later that year, Middlesex Wanderers were put forward by the FA to accept an invitation from the Nigerian government to play matches as part of the country's independence celebrations. In 1967, Wanderers embarked on a tour of the Far East, beginning in Japan, paving the way for other European teams, including Arsenal who visited the following year. In the opening match, before which the party were presented to the brother of the Emperor, Wanderers beat the national team in front of 46,000 spectators, a record for a football match in Japan, and lost one and won one of the remaining two matches. A trophy presented by the club on their return visit in 1969, intended to encourage youth football, is still used for the National High School Soccer Tournament, and they have revisited the country several times since. In 2003, at a ceremony held at the Japanese Embassy in London, the club was presented with the Ambassador's Commendation in recognition of \\"its contribution to the promotion of football in Japan and to the cause of friendship between Japan and the United Kingdom.\\" Shunichiro Okano, president of the Japan FA leading up to the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in Japan and South Korea, who was present at the ceremony, said that of all the football visitors to his country, \\"the most lasting impression has been that made by Middlesex Wanderers, on and off the field, with their friendly attitude and sportsmanship.\\" They also played twice in South Korea in 1967, one victory and one defeat against the national team, and returned more than once, including for the 1977 President's Cup.

In numerous journal and magazine articles, books, and public lectures, she shared her extensive knowledge of wildflowers and shrubs while arguing tirelessly for their protection. A self-proclaimed ‚Äúlady- gypsy‚Äù, Rowntree spent most of each year doing fieldwork in California and the West while living outdoors, believing that the only way to know native plants was to live with them for weeks at a time in their natural surroundings. Because of her reputation as a field botanist, Rowntree has been compared favorably to David Douglas, the 19th century British botanist who first documented western North American flora. Joan Parry Dutton writes: ‚ÄúThere are striking similarities between Lester Rowntree and David Douglas. In fact, Lester could be Douglas‚Äô plant-wise and spiritual descendant [for] Lester's knowledge of California wild flowers is unrivaled; it is safe she knows more about them than Douglas ever knew. \\" Biography Born Gertrude Ellen Lester to a Quaker family in Penrith, England, she spent the first the first ten years of her life in the picturesque landscape of the Lakes District, nurturing a deep appreciation of nature and an outdoor life. In 1889 Lester‚Äôs family relocated to the United States, to a homestead in Kansas where two of her siblings died because of a contaminated water supply. After these disastrous two years in Kansas the Lester family moved to a Quaker community near Los Angeles; it was here that Lester first became acquainted with the California wildflowers that became her life‚Äôs passion. Although Lester attended high school at Westtown outside of Philadelphia, and settled originally in New Jersey after marriage to Bernard Rowntree (also of a Quaker family) in 1908, and where their only child, Cedric Rowntree, was born in 1911, they relocated back to southern California in 1920, and then to the Carmel Highlands (a few miles south of Carmel itself) in 1925. There, on property overlooking the Pacific, Lester began her career with native plants. By 1930 she owned a business, Lester Rowntree & Company in Carmel, Ca. which sold wildflower seeds to gardeners across the country. She never gathered seeds in the wild to sell directly but took just enough wild-seed to propagate seed stock in her garden. Domestic matters, however, suffered and in 1931 Lester and Bernard divorced; Lester moved up the hill above the coastal pine forest where she built a small wooden house and nursery on several acres that became her garden and home base until her death in 1979, five days after her 100th birthday. Writing Lester Rowntree was a talented and prolific writer, authoring two well-received books on native plants and shrubs, four children‚Äôs books, and over 700 magazine, newspaper, and journal articles. A full bibliography of her writings is found as an appendix in the 2006 reprinting of ‚ÄúHardy Californians‚Äù. A sample of Rowntree's lively prose follows, taken from her article ‚ÄúThe Lone Hunter‚Äù published in the June 1939 issue of The Atlantic Monthly. ‚ÄúIt took adversity to bring me the sort of life I have always longed for. Not until after my domestic happiness had gone to smash did I realize that I was free to trek up and down the long state of California, and to satisfy my insistent curiosity about plants, to find them in their homes meeting their days and seasons, to write down their tricks and manners in my notebook, to photograph their flowers, to collect their seeds, to bring home seedlings in cans just emptied of tomato juice. ‚Äú I didn't take up this for the poetry of it. I had no ambition to become a picturesque Lady- Gypsy. I honestly wanted to find out about California wild flowers. There was little written about them in their habitats and nothing at all about their behavior in the garden, so I made it my job to discover the facts for myself.... \\"I inhabit my hillside only from November to February, while the winter storms are blowing and the winter rains pouring. In March and April I have long shining days on the desert, in May happy weeks in the foothills, where a chorus of robins wakes me and my morning bath is in a rushing stream of just-melted snow. In June I am in the northern counties scented with new- mown hay and wild strawberries. In July in the higher mountains, and in August and September up in the alpine zone with mule or burro.‚Äù Legacy Writer and horticulturalist Judith Larner Lowry comments on Rowntree's legacy: ‚ÄúToday, it would be hard to find a professional in the field of native plant horticulture who was not, at some point, inspired by Lester Rowntree. The model of her double focus, wildland exploration and landscape use of plants, is followed by numerous California native plant horticulturists, from arboretum directors to landscapers to nursery professionals, who make regular trips into the wild for the pleasure of observing plants in their homes and to collect seeds and cuttings for propagation.‚Äù  Notes and references  *Barker, Philip A. ‚ÄúA Visit with Lester Rowntree.‚Äù American Horticultural Magazine 44.

She debuted on-screen in the first episode of Crownies broadcast on 14 July 2011. To prepare, Dusseldorp researched legal cases and observed prosecutors in court. She also visited the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions Nicholas Cowdery and shadowed Margaret Cunneen SC, a Senior Crown Prosecutor and model for the character Janet King. Janet is characterised as a \\"tough and tenacious\\" Senior Crown Prosecutor who has worked in the DPP office for ten years. The character is in a same-sex relationship and has children via IVF. When Crownies finished airing plans were made to create a spin-off show centric to the character. Janet King was produced in 2013 with Dusseldorp returning to the titular role. The actress has stated that she made deliberate changes to ensure Janet listened to others more often. The character has been well received by critics. Glen Humphries of the Illawarra Mercury opined that Janet was a \\"standout character\\" and Debi Enker labeled her one of Crownies \\"better\\" characters. Crikey's Ben Neutze said Janet was the viewers‚Äô favourite. Guy Davis from The Newcastle Herald named her a role model for junior solicitors. While ABC1 Controller Brendan Dahill has publicised his admiration of Dusseldorp's portrayal. In 2014, Dusseldorp won the AACTA Award for Best Lead Actress in a Television Drama for her portrayal of Janet. Development=Creation and casting The character was conceived by associate producer Hilary Bonney and co-producer Jane Allen. Bonney explained that Janet developed from their \\"combined experiences\\", as she is a barrister and Allen is a criminal lawyer and writer. Janet is also gay, like Allen. Bonney wrote, \\"she is a bit of both of us, and of all the women we know and admire who work in criminal law.\\" On 24 January 2011, Greg Hassall from The Sydney Morning Herald announced Dusseldorp's involvement in the show. The following month, Les Kennedy of The Sun-Herald revealed that she had been cast as the drama's senior Crown prosecutor. Dusseldorp spent eight months filming the role for Crownies. Preparation In preparation for the role Dusseldorp researched numerous legal cases and observed prosecutors behaviour before judges in district courts. She and fellow cast member Lewis Fitz-Gerald (who plays David Sinclair) visited and was welcomed by the Director of Public Prosecutions Nicholas Cowdery. She also shadowed a Senior Crown Prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen SC. Her time with Margaret Cunneen SC found her attending conferences with defence lawyers, psychiatrists and a victim. She also inspected the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions office. Dusseldorp found the experience \\"humbling\\" and became \\"addicted\\" to the serious nature surrounding cases. Dusseldorp explained to a reporter from Lawyers Weekly that she found it challenging when she realised \\"how atrocious\\" most cases are. She credited her research for her admiration of the job prosecutors do for the community. Dusseldorp used her experiences to portray Janet. She told Wendy Tuohy of the Herald Sun she wanted to capture the \\"public/private dichotomy\\" of a Prosecutor. She believed they had slight arrogance and were calm and collected when in court. They would not decide to prosecute unless they believed in a conviction. Dusseldorp stated \\"I feel very much when I do the show I am always working with the truth, and on the right side.\\" Characterisation Janet studied law at the University of Sydney before being awarded with a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University. She is an experienced barrister and has worked in the DPP's office for ten years. She is characterised as tough and tenacious, with a sharp tongue and mind. The actress described Janet as \\"complicated, competent, risky, vicious, loving.\\" Dusseldorp was loath to portray Janet as too \\"hard-nosed and ball-breaking\\". Despite Janet's strong willed nature, she said of her portrayal, \\"I've tried to confess to the audience when I can that she's actually as fragile and full of feeling and love for humanity.\\" The actress also admired how self-assured Janet is. Dusseldorp has tried to play Janet with little compassion because becoming emotionally involved with victims is not helpful for prosecutors' cases. Instead her compassion is learned over time through situations arising in her personal life. But one storyline really challenged the actress. When Janet deals with a case of child murder, Dusseldorp found it difficult to say her lines without crying. Knowing that Janet would not become emotional she had to overcome the predicament. The series does explore light-hearted stories. Dusseldorp has stated that she plays Janet more \\"wry than dry\\" in such scenarios. Dusseldorp's hair was coloured by stylist Timothy Cole especially for the role. Janet is a lesbian and Dusseldorp told Graeme Watson from \\"Out in Perth\\" that viewers were happy with it. She believed that depiction of lesbian characters was not prevalent. She liked her character because ‚Äúshe was one of the most all rounded women‚Äù she had played. She told Sacha Molitorisz from The Age \\"not to give anything away, she's in a lesbian relationship and things spin out of control a bit.\\" Janet becomes pregnant via in vitro fertilisation and as a mother of two, Dusseldorp felt able to portray pregnancy accurately. The pregnancy and relationship storyline was played out as a background sub-plot. Janet King spin-off ABC1 Controller Brendan Dahill praised Dusseldorp's portrayal.Prior to Crownies final airing, ABC1 Channel Controller Brendan Dahill revealed that he wanted a spin-off to be created. He also cited Dusseldorp and Michael as his favourite performers. On 20 August 2012, ABC TV confirmed that it had commissioned an \\"8-part legal and political thriller\\" titled Janet King. ABC's Head of Fiction, Carole Sklan branded Janet a \\"fabulous character\\" and the series would be \\"exciting\\" and centric around Janet. She added \\"the series looks at the dilemmas of a contemporary woman who returns to work after a year's maternity leave and is flung into a shocking prosecution that involves layers of intrigue played out at the highest levels of power. Janet King's case leads her through some astounding twists and revelations that impact on her life on every level.\\" Screentime's Des Monaghan said that it had become obvious to his company and the ABC that the audience had developed \\"a great deal\\" of affection for the character of Janet and was happy to build on that success. It was also revealed that more of the cast of Crownies would return alongside Dusseldorp. Sklan later revealed more details in a press release. She stated \\"Janet returns to the DPP to confront a high-profile murder and a conspiracy which will threaten to unravel her life and everything she loves.\\" She also praised Dusseldorp's portrayal of Janet as \\"compelling and captivating\\". Dusseldorp loves playing Janet but often finds the experience a \\"harrowing\\" one. She told Elissa Blake from The Sydney Morning Herald that Janet \\"never shuts up\\". She believed that in Crownies Janet did not listen to others - \\"she knew what she knew and that was that\\". But she deliberately played her differently in Janet King and despite admiring her superior trait; Dusseldorp felt the need to tone it down. Janet's foray into motherhood also makes her uncertain if she wants to return to work. The actress added that \\"then, just as she's wondering if it's all worth it, she's propelled into a series of horrors.\\" Storylines Janet's prosecutes in a case of a murdered teenager. She and Lina Badir (Andrea Demetriades) then go to the trial and the suspect is found guilty. When a secret file is leaked to the press, Janet reprimands Lina, Erin O'Shaughnessy (Ella Scott Lynch), Ben McMahon (Todd Lasance), Richard Stirling (Hamish Michael) and Tatum Novak (Indiana Evans). The Office of the DPP becomes under bombardment from journalists. Janet and David make it clear that they will end the career of the culprit. Janet then deals with more harrowing cases ranging from child murder to a drawn-out fraud case. Erin learns that Janet is pregnant and they form a friendship. But when Erin turns a case down Janet becomes harsh with her explaining that she needs to become less emotionally involved. Janet uses her experience to get Tina Chang (Tasneem Roc) to testify in court but she is later attacked. This and other cases make her feel the pressure of work and pregnancy. She then helps Ben on a case following the murder of his grandfather. Janet is faced with many problems but some advice from Tony Gillies (Peter Kowitz) secures a prosecution. Janet goes to have her first scan with partner Ashleigh Larsson (Aimee Pedersen). They later discover that they are having twins but there is a possibility of a foetal disability. When she later discovers the sex of the babies she accidentally tells Ash when, after Ash has bought the cribs for the twins, Janet says \\"just don't buy one blue and one pink bedding\\", which reveals the babies' sex. Ash is elated at the prospect of having a boy and a girl. Janet and Lina become conflicted over the mental state of a child accused of murder, Max Gardiner (Nicholas Bakopoulos-Cooke). Despite Janet's reluctance to prosecute him, David forces her to. The case proves controversial in the office and Janet and Lina fail to change their stance on the case. Following a series of developments Max eventually is found innocent. Janet is shocked when Max is found dead and promises to try to help the family again. She also promises to help Sean Gardiner (David Franklin) defeat charges but the DPP override her. Janet helps Erin out following her troubles but then Erin gets drunk at Janet's during dinner that evening. Erin apologises by throwing a baby shower for Janet. Janet's maternity leave approaches but she continues with large work loads. David decides Janet should be shifted onto smaller cases instead despite her reluctance. Janet goes into labour without Ash and Erin is forced to comfort her. Reception Ben Neutze from Crikey believed that Janet was the viewers favourite Crownies character. He opined that combined with Dusseldorp's raised acting profile the spin-off series would be successful. \\"Out in Perth's\\" Watson branded her a \\"professional, detached, incredibly intelligent, ambitious and amazing\\" character. A writer from Lawyers Weekly branded Janet the \\"head-honcho\\" of Crownies. Guy Davis from The Newcastle Herald branded Janet a mentor and role model to the junior solicitors. Glen Humphries of the Illawarra Mercury opined that Janet was a \\"standout character\\" and \\"hard-nosed workaholic\\". Critic Debi Enker has also echoed that Janet was one of Crownies \\"better\\" characters and Dusseldorp one of the \\"standout\\" actors. The Sydney Morning Herald's Ruth Ritchie said \\"perennial hard workers Jeanette Cronin, Marta Dusseldorp, Lewis Fitz-Gerald and Peter Kowitz are all at their best. They bring nuance and heft to their wonderfully written characters.\\" His colleague Doug Anderson described Janet as a veteran solicitor who \\"is as tough as they come but she is also vulnerable\\". Nicholas Cowdery of The Sun-Herald said that Janet represented \\"the independence and courage of the DPP\\" and viewed it as \\"heartening\\". While fellow reporter Elissa Blake described her \\"fearless lawyer with cool intelligence and subtle sex appeal.\\" While Greg Hassall believed Janet was one of the show's strong characters and Dusseldorp deserved a Logie Award. The Age's Larissa Dubecki said that Dusseldorp's portrayal of Janet taking on the case of Ben's grandfather death \\"exudes gravitas\\"; despite having to recite \\"clunky expository dialogue about the jury system\\". For her portrayal of Janet, Dusseldorp won the Best Lead Actress in a Television Drama accolade at the 4th AACTA Awards in 2014. The following year, she was nominated for the Logie Award for Most Outstanding Actress.

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I is an action role-playing game produced by Interplay Productions for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is an adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring by J. R. R. Tolkien. Gameplay The player begins the game as Frodo Baggins, and progressively acquires the remaining members of the Fellowship; Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin Took, Meriadoc Brandybuck, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf (Boromir strangely only makes a single brief appearance). With the addition of extra controllers and the Super Multitap, the game supported more than four players. Players could play as Frodo, Samwise, Pippin, Merry, Gimli, and Aragorn. Using cheats or an emulator, players could also play as a non-combatant Legolas or Gandalf, supporting up to 8 players (although Legolas cannot do anything but move around and take damage). Any characters not controlled by the player(s) are controlled by the computer A.I.. The game progresses through a series of \\"fetch quests\\" in which the player must explore vast environments to retrieve items relevant to the game's story. These items are often simple trinkets that have been misplaced by the game's non-player characters (NPCs). Much like the book, the game begins in the Shire, the land of the Hobbits. The game's plot takes the player to various locations from the book, such as the village of Bree, the elven city of Rivendell, and the Mines of Moria. Unlike the book, however, the finale of the game is the fight between the Fellowship and the Balrog creature in the Mines of Moria (the first volume of the book ends significantly later). If a character dies, the death is permanent and the player cannot use them for the rest of the game. The sequel, The Lord of the Rings: Volume II, was meant to pick up where Part I left off, but due to poor sales, no sequel was ever released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Hobbiton  Reception  GamePro panned the game, citing gameplay dominated by \\"long, indistinguishable romps\\", overly small character and enemy sprites, limited character upgrade features, poor support character AI, and low difficulty.

History Adobe Experience Cloud includes a set of analytics, social, advertising, media optimization, targeting, Web experience management and content management products aimed at the advertising industry and hosted on Amazon Web Services. Like other Adobe Cloud services (e.g., Adobe Creative Cloud), the Adobe Marketing Cloud allows users with valid subscriptions to download the entire collection and use it directly on their computers with open access to online updates. The Adobe Marketing Cloud collection was introduced to the public in October 2012 as Adobe began retiring the Omniture name it acquired in October 2009. Products of the defunct company were then integrated step-by-step into the new Cloud service which includes the following eight applications: Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Adobe Social, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Media Optimizer, Adobe Campaign (Classic and Standard), Audience Manager and Primetime. In November 2013, Adobe Systems introduced mobile features to its Marketing Cloud, making smartphones and other mobile devices new targets for analytics. On September 15, 2009, Omniture, Inc. and Adobe Systems announced that Adobe would be acquiring Omniture, an online marketing and web analytics business unit in Orem, Utah. The deal of $1.8 billion, was completed on October 23, 2009, and is now joined by other Adobe acquisitions such as Day Software and Efficient Frontier, as the main components of Adobe's Digital Marketing Business Unit. Around 2012, Adobe withdrew the Omniture brand while its products were being integrated into the Adobe Marketing Cloud. On May 21, 2018, Adobe announced the acquisition of Magento for $1.68 billion. The addition of the Magento Commerce will enable commerce features to be integrated into the Adobe Experience Cloud. In the same year, on September 20, 2018, Adobe acquired the marketing automation company Marketo. The acquisition is expected to close in Q4 2018.

The plant appears to be a facultative parasite, capable of surviving without draining nutrients from other plants but growing more healthy if it can draw sustenance from other plants. Stems can reach a height of 40 cm (16 inches). Leaves and stems tend to be hairless toward the bottom, finely hairy above, and bristly in the inflorescence. Leaves are narrowly lanceolate, tapering gradually toward the tip.

Northeast of Catania are several villages in the province of Catania with names that begin with Aci, such as Aci Sant'Antonio, Acireale, Aci Catena, Aci Castello and Aci Bonaccorsi, so it is possible that the name Acitana could be a portmanteau of Cantania and one of these Aci villages.

She mentored Frank Stella and Carl Andre, and had art pieces shown alongside such notable contemporaries as Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko. Morgan's life began in New York City to an aristocratic family. She was also known as Boston's Modernist Doyenne. She died from complications resulting from pneumonia in 1999. Education and early life Maud Cabot grew up in New York City, where she graduated from Miss Chapin's School in 1921 She then attended Barnard College. Upon graduating, she moved to Paris to study at The Sorbonne. She travelled throughout the world and met such notable people as Mahatma Gandhi, and travelled Europe with the likes of James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway. She later travelled to Russia to witness and experience communism, and came back to Paris, where she met her husband, Patrick Morgan, an American contemporary artist, whose influence encouraged her to paint. Her marriage to Pat Morgan took place in a lawyer's office on a snowy day in New York in 1931. She wasn't very interested in getting married, and thus wanted to minimize the importance of the occasion. Together they moved back to New York City. She absolutely loved living in New York and she could see herself building and continuing her life there. Career In 1938, Morgan showed her first exhibit, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as the Whitney Gallery purchased some of her works. Just as her career was blooming, she decided to move with her husband to Andover Massachusetts, where he had acquired a teaching position. As a woman artist working in a Boston suburb, away from the New York spotlight, Morgan's chances for serious recognition became severely reduced. In a 1996 interview in the Boston Globe, Morgan confirmed that she believed her move to Andover sorely undermined the possibility of becoming recognized. \\"I was in just the right hot spot. I think I could have made it into--I'm not saying the top echelon--but I could have made . . . a certain kind of fame.\\" It has been speculated that another factor in Morgan's lack of fame was that her work was not identifiably feminine. In contrast to other noteworthy female artists, Morgan's work, as critic Mary Sherman stated, did not conform to \\"our notions of female art.\\" While she lived in Andover, she taught art at Abbot Academy and continued to expand and experiment her media in art. She exhibited at the Margaret Brown Gallery in Boston. In the late 1950s, her works were exhibited regularly at the Barbara Singer Gallery, and she was given one-person shows at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, the Fuller Art Museum in Brockton, the Addison Gallery in Andover, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

It presents the fictional story of the Vers Empire's 37 clans of Orbital Knights' attempted reconquest of Earth‚Äîenabled by the empowering titular Aldnoah energy/drive technology‚Äîfollowing return to Earth as a more technologically advanced people after a human diaspora to the planet Mars. Plotted by Gen Urobuchi with direction by Ei Aoki, the series features principal Japanese voice acting by Natsuki Hanae, Kensho Ono and Sora Amamiya, with animated relational and battle scenes set on or in the orbit of the fictional Earth of 2014, the Landing Castles of the Vers Empire's Orbital Knights, Vers bases on a shattered remnant of Earth's Moon, and occasionally, the Vers palace of its failing emperor on Mars. The series began in July 2014, and as of March 2015, had presented two 12-episode seasons, with Urobuchi, Katsuhiko Takayama and Shinsuke Onishi, and then Hiroyuki Sawano and Kalafina, respectively, receiving principal script-writing and music credits. Plot In 1972, during the Apollo 17 mission, an ancient alien artifact named the \\"Hypergate\\" was discovered on the surface of the Moon, allowing for near- instantaneous travel to and from Mars and the colonisation of Mars. After settlers discover additional alien technology on Mars (dubbed \\"Aldnoah\\"), they one-sidedly declare independence from Earth to found the Vers Empire. Later, the Vers Empire declares war on Earth, and in 1999, a battle on the Moon's surface causes the Hypergate to explode, shattering the Moon and scattering the remnants of the Moon into a debris belt around Earth. Cut off from Mars, the remnants of the Vers Imperial Army establishes several massive orbital space stations within the debris belt and a ceasefire was established. 15 years later, in 2014, an attack on the First Princess of Vers during a diplomatic mission to Earth causes the Empire and its 37 clans of Orbital Knights to launch a new attack on Earth, this time determined to conquer it once and for all. Characters=Main characters ; : :A student attending Shinawara High School at the top of his class, he lives with his elder sister, Yuki, before the start of the war on which the plot is focused; when the war begins, he joins the United Forces of Earth along with his classmates in the war against the Vers. He is characterised by his emotionless, stoic demeanor; in addition, he displays extraordinary ingenuity in battle, regularly devising devastating tactics to defeat Martian Knights in battle. According to Yuki, he may have developed feelings for Princess Asseylum. This is later proven true when his AI partner inadvertently confesses to Asseylum that Inaho sees her as an extension of himself, and values her life even more than his own. During the war, while the rest of his squad uses the more heavily armored KG-7 Areion, he operates a training unit, the KG-6 Sleipnir as his personal machine, preferring its greater maneuverability over the thicker armour of the Areion, which he correctly determines matters little in the war against the more technologically advanced Vers Empire. He has the ability to activate Aldnoah Drive technology, having inadvertently received a part of Asseylum's powers after carrying out CPR on her and accidentally ingesting some of her blood and saliva. After he was shot by Slaine, he receives a cybernetic left eye to replace the damaged one; the eye, which contains both a processor specialized in movement-prediction algorithms intended to replace the also damaged temporal cortex of his brain and an artificial intelligence originally designed to run said algorithms, advances his ability to engage Orbital Knights to an even higher degree. But the powerful AI-run eye comes at a massive cost as his inability to process large amounts of data for a long period of time continues to damage his brain. In the final battle of the war, he defeats Slaine in one-on-one Kataphrakt combat, sparing his life at the request of Asseylum, after which Slaine is imprisoned. The series ends with Inaho, now having the AI-run implant removed, explaining Asseylum's wish that he live to Slaine, and confirming that Inaho will watch over him during his imprisonment. He leaves Slaine's private prison looking out to the sea, reminiscing about his days with Asseylum. ; : :A Terran (Earth-born human) subservient to the Vers Count Cruhteo and Inaho's nemesis. Slaine is a close friend of Princess Asseylum, who saved Slaine and his now-deceased father five years prior to the beginning of the story. He is fiercely loyal to her and although he is at first a pacifist, he will shoot to kill when he believes that Princess Asseylum's safety is endangered. After Saazbaum nearly kills Asseylum, he shoots and leaves Inaho for dead, sparing Saazbaum and declaring his full loyalty to the Martians. He is later knighted by Count Saazbaum and pilots the Kataphrakt Tharsis, which once belonged to Cruhteo and has a precognitive ability. After being named as Saazbaum's heir, he kills Saazbaum as vengeance for Princess Asseylum and rises to the rank of Count. Long in love with the unconscious Asseylum, Slaine grieves her silently and agrees to marry Princess Lemrina, who poses as Asseylum. Upon Asseylum's reawakening, his frustration and despair corrupt his personality, and he changes from a peaceful, well-intentioned young man to a war-hungry militant. This, compounded with his growing ire of Inaho's success on the battlefield, his ignorance to his fellow Terran's political subterfuge, and the realization that Asseylum has feelings for his greatest rival, causes a mental breakdown that destabilizes his own ranks. This positioning allows Asseylum's revelation of his conspiracy to cause him to be abandoned by the majority of his allied Counts. In a final act of defiance, he engages in a brutal final battle with Inaho, piloting his Tharsis against Inaho in brutal one-on-one combat. He is narrowly defeated by Inaho, and afterward has the entire blame of the war placed on him and is subsequently imprisoned; his bitterness and rage are quelled only by Inaho's telling him that Asseylum specifically asked Inaho to spare him. ; : :The First Princess of the Vers Empire. She is very close to Slaine and is curious to learn about Earth. Visiting Earth on a diplomatic visit, her motorcade is attacked, and she is presumed dead; while she was not killed in the attack (a body double replaced her, as she had fallen ill), the attempted assassination is used by the Orbital Knights as a casus belli for their invasion. Asseylum travels with Inaho's group under a false identity (\\"Seylum\\") until she transmits a message to her grandfather on Mars, in hopes of stopping the rekindled war. After Saazbaum nearly kills her, Slaine convinces the Count to save her instead. She remains in suspended animation while recovering from her injuries, eventually awakening to find that Slaine and Princess Lemrina are waging war against Earth in her name. While escaping Slaine's military base, she encounters an unconscious Inaho and is able to escape with the help of the AI implanted in his mechanical eye. While assisting her, the AI inadvertently confesses Inaho's affection for the Princess, explaining that the earthling views her as an extension of himself. Asseylum then asks the AI that she reciprocates his feeling, confessing her own admiration and love. After escaping, Asseylum eventually regains control of the Vers Empire and is betrothed to the son of Count Cruhteo, who shares her desire for peace with Earth. She does this to separate the Vers military from Slaine's forces, which he had allied by using Lemrina in disguise to claim the position for himself and exposing his treachery. By denying Slaine the majority of his allies, the Earth's military is able to defeat the remnants of Slaine's forces. Taking control of the Vers Empire, Asseylum marries the son of Count Cruhteo, and establishes a lasting peace between Earth and Mars. The series ends with her reminiscing about her lessons with Slaine, and her days at sea with Inaho. United Forces of Earth ; : :Inaho's childhood friend and fellow high school classmate, who is strongly hinted to have feelings for Inaho. She is a member of the Student Council Committee and later a member of Inaho's squad. ; : :A Martian girl living on Earth. Her father was stranded on Earth after the previous war. He and a few comrades carry out the assassination attempt on Princess Asseylum in exchange for the promise of extraction back to Mars and knighthood under the Vers Empire. Rayet witnessed Trillram murder her father and fellow conspirators to keep them quiet and, after Yuki rescued her, swore vengeance on the Martians. She eventually becomes a member of Inaho's squad. ; : :Inaho's friend and classmate. He comes from a country that was severely affected by Heaven's Fall. Despite the name, he is actually very loud and jovial, though he swears vengeance on all Martians after a Knight kills his friend. He becomes a mechanic in service to the United Forces of Earth. ; : :Inko's best friend who is also in Inaho's class. She comes from the same country as Calm that was severely affected by Heaven's Fall. She operates controls for the Deucalion aboard its bridge. ; : :Inaho's friend and classmate. His friends call him . He is killed while trying to save Yuki from Trillram. ; : :A Shinawara High student who is Inaho's senior, and one of the volunteers for lieutenant Marito's rescue crew. ; : :A Shinawara High student who is Inaho's senior, and one of the volunteers for Lieutenant Marito's rescue crew. ; : :Inaho's older sister and a Warrant Officer in service to the United Forces of Earth. She is capable of piloting a Kataphrakt into battle and has helped to train Kataphrakt pilots at the academy. She constantly worries that Inaho might get killed with all his plans, but supports him nonetheless. When Inaho is nearly killed, she abandons the Deucalion crew for 19 months before eventually returning alongside Marito. ; : :A Lieutenant of the United Forces of Earth. He, along with Yuki, was originally a training instructor at the high school Inaho attends, but is also a veteran of the War of 1999, and witnessed firsthand the power of Aldnoah. Despite reporting what happened 15 years ago before Heaven's Fall, the governments of Earth refused to publicize any information, as it showed how outmatched Earth's forces truly were. One of his close friends was killed in that battle, and Marito now suffers from PTSD and drinks heavily to cope with his flashbacks to the battle. ; : :A doctor living in the city of Shinawara and a friend of Marito who helps him deal with his trauma. ; : :A Captain of the United Forces of Earth. She helps Marito evacuate the civilians while Inaho and his friends distract Trillram. She blames Marito for the death of her older brother, who died in the battle of Tanegashima before Heaven's Fall. ; : :Captain Magbaredge's executive officer. She takes command of the refugee escort mission when Darzana volunteers to help Marito. Darzana usually tries to give her some dating advice, even in the middle of a battle. ; : :A sergeant of the United Forces of Earth, and one of the volunteers for lieutenant Marito's rescue crew. Vers Empire ; : :A young Martian girl who serves Princess Asseylum as her loyal maid. She has unintentionally revealed the princess' identity on numerous occasions. She is very conscious of etiquette and takes offense when people speak to the princess in a casual manner. She temporary serves Lemrina, Asseylum's half sister, and near the end of the episode, returns to Princess Asseylum's service. ; : :A Count of the Vers Empire and one of the Martian Knights who beats Slaine for any slight, no matter how small. A friend of Saazbaum, but he seems to be unaware that Saazbaum is one of the conspirators who tried to assassinate the princess. After he brutally tortures Slaine for information, he realizes the truth about the princess' alleged assassination. He apologizes to Slaine and swears to find the culprits, only to be attacked and killed by Saazbaum. His Kataphrakt Tharsis, that possesses precognitive abilities, is given to Slaine by Saazbaum. ; : :A Count of the Vers Empire, one of the Martian Knights, and a friend of Cruhteo who has been eager to rekindle a war between Mars and Earth. He is one of the conspirators behind the murder attempt of Princess Asseylum. He pilots the Kataphrakt Dioskuria and uses it to attack Cruhteo's castle when he realizes he has been discovered. He kills his fellow Martian Knight and captures Slaine. He reveals that Slaine's father saved him during the Heaven's Fall, hence the reason of why he took Slaine when he thought Cruhteo was going to kill him. The woman he loved died during Heaven's Fall and blames the royal family for her death, so now he wants to kill Asseylum and take Earth's resources as a way of revenge. His Dioskuria possesses a barrier like the Nilokeras, a beam katana like the Argyre, and rocket punches like the Hellas. Inaho defeated him by taking advantage of every weakness it possesses. Despite shooting to kill the princess, he is spared by Slaine and forced to save her. He eventually adopts Slaine and names him his successor but during a battle, he is killed by his adoptive son in a trap set for Inaho, but Slaine justifies it as revenge for trying to kill Asseylum. ; : :A Martian Knight and Baron under the Vers Empire who enjoys killing Terrans, and also killed fellow Martians who carried out the attempted assassination on Princess Asseylum to tie up loose ends. He pilots the Kataphrakt Nilokeras, that possesses a defensive shield that absorbs all types of matter that touch it, until Inaho found its weakness. Later he was shot dead after inadvertently revealing to Slaine that he was one of the conspirators. ; : :A Martian Knight in pursuit of survivors from Shinawara who pilots the Kataphrakt Argyre, that has a large beam katana, capable of cutting through anything, including explosive rounds shot in its direction. He was forced to retreat after being defeated by Inaho, Calm and Inko. He returns, trying to get his revenge and battles Inaho, only to be killed once Inaho uses the power of his sword against him; he makes him fall in the ocean and the temperature of the beams cause a massive steam explosion that obliterates him. ; : :A Martian Knight with the rank of Countess who encounters the survivors of Shinawara when they arrive to Tanegashima. She pilots the Kataphrakt Hellas, that can shoot its six arms as missiles, but act more like drones than actual \\"projectiles\\". Aside from its fists, the Hellas has no other weapons, which renders it vulnerable to melee attacks. After all six of her arms are destroyed by the teamwork of Slaine and Inaho, she turns Hellas into a flying platform, only to be crushed by the giant battleship Deucalion powered by Asseylum. She is then finished off by Rayet. ; : :A Martian Knight with the rank of Viscountess and Saazbaum's late betrothed, who piloted the gigantic Kataphrakt Deucalion, that possessed anti-gravity powers. She died during Heaven's Fall when she and Saazbaum were sent to Tanegashima as an advance party and her anti-gravity device got damaged with the destruction of the Hyper Gate, urging Saazbaum to leave her behind. The Aldnoah Drive of her Kataphrakt was used in the creation of the flying battleship Deucalion. ; : :A subordinate of the Martian Knights who is assigned to Slaine, despite being older, and comes to greatly admire him, since he comes from a humble family. He is later given Herschel, Marylcian's Kataphrakt by Slaine. He and the Stygis platoon refuse to abandon Slaine when he orders them to retreat in the final battle. ; : :A Martian Knight and Baron that attacks the Deucalion while it's going through repairs. He pilots the Kataphrakt Elysium, that's capable of creating a 1km radius Entropy Dilution Field, that freezes everything around it, and deflects bullets thanks to the Meissner effect. He is killed when Inaho manages to reach him and shoots him at point blank. ; : :A Martian Knight with the rank of Count, who looks down on Slaine for being a Terran, especially after he ascends to the rank of Count. He challenges Slaine to a duel in order to see who's more worthy of protecting the princess. He pilots the Kataphrakt Herschel that is capable of shooting projectiles incredibly fast in all directions, putting Slaine in trouble, until he manages to lure him to an area where it can only shoot in one direction, destroying his drones. When he tries to flee, Slaine decapitates his Kataphrakt, ejecting him into outer space. ; : :A Martian Knight with the rank of Count, who seems to get along with Marylcian. After Saazbaum is killed, he and Marylcian distrust the ambitions of the newly named Count Slaine, but cannot accuse him since they have no proof. He serves as witness for Marylcian and Slaine's duel. He pilots the Kataphrakt Octantis, that uses a pair of razor-sharp spinning discs on wires, that can even deflect bullets by being spun perpendicular to the bullets' flight path, creating the effect of a shield. He chooses to fight alongside Harklight and the Stygis platoon instead of retreating during the final battle. ; : :A Martian Knight contacted by Barouhcruz and Marylcian. He holds no contempt over the people of Earth and merely wants resources and prefers not to fight. He pilots the Kataphrakt Sirenum that's capable of creating a powerful gravitational tornado. He is defeated by Inaho and Marito and captured. When Inaho interrogates him and realizes his intentions are not the same as the other Martians, he tells him about the assassination and his suspicions about the impostor. He is later released by Inaho and Rayet, promising to find the real Asseylum and protect her. His space palace is used as the refuge of Asseylum after he allies with the new Count Cruheteo, the two of whom become the base for what will quickly grow to be her loyalist faction. ; : :A Martian Knight and Count who landed in New Orleans. He pilots the Kataphrakt Solis that possesses two plasma beam mounts on its head that can be used to cut through anything. He and his Kataphrakt are destroyed by the Deucalion from extreme range when its crew, led by Inaho, takes advantage of its inability to shoot laser beams beyond the horizon (since lasers are unaffected by the Earth's curvature), while the Deucalion's cannons are able to fire using parabolic trajectories, leaving the Solis unable to retaliate. ; : :A Martian Knight with the rank of Count, who works alongside Count Orga and Countess Rafia. He pilots the Kataphrakt Electris, that's capable of controlling and firing massive bolts of electricity. He is killed when Inaho manages to latch his Kataphrakt onto the Electris and equalize the electric potential between the two Kataphrakts, making him immune to the Electris' lightning attacks and allowing him to safely destroy it. ; : :A Martian Knight with the rank of Countess, who works alongside Count Zebrin and Count Orga. She pilots the Kataphrakt Scandia, which has powerful cloaking capabilities that leave neither shadow nor heat signature, and is armed with a crossbow that fires explosive arrows. She is killed after her Kataphrakt is located with a smokescreen (as Inaho correctly deduces that, being a physical object, the Kataphrakt will still affect air currents, and could thus be rendered visible by its interaction with the smoke), and destroyed by Yuki's Kataphrakt armed with a high-powered rifle. ; : :A Martian Knight with the rank of Count, who works alongside Count Zebrin and Countess Rafia. He pilots the Kataphrakt Ortygia, which is capable of creating copies of itself through quantum teleportation. However, the Ortygia is able, through unexplained means, to retain the original individual after teleporting, in effect creating a clone of both his Kataphrakt and himself. This means that instead of being drones controlled by a single \\"master\\" unit (the initial hypothesis of the Deucalion crew), each copy is the \\"real\\" Ortygia and is individually controlled by Orga (or a copy of him), meaning it cannot be destroyed as long as one remains. Inaho kills him by taking control of the weapons systems of every Kataphrakt in his platoon, targeting and firing on every Ortygia unit simultaneously, destroying them all. ; : :The eldest son of Count Cruhteo, who arrives from Mars with the interest of meeting Slaine. Unlike his father, he is rather humble and friendly, but also sharp and perceptive. He is still loyal to the Emperor and saves Asseylum from being killed by assassins. He helps Asseylum have one last talk with her grandfather, and becomes her betrothed to help her cement her position as Empress and to make peace with Earth. ; : :The Martian Emperor and Princess Asseylum's grandfather. He founded the empire in 1972 when the Aldnoah technology recognized him as its master, burning its activation processes into his very genes, giving him supreme authority over them. All of his descendants share this power, and he can grant limited control of the Aldnoah's powers to others. Utilizing this power monopoly, he based the authority of his empire on this military force and created a class of warlords loyal to him who would become the Martian Knights. He retired in 1997 due to health problems, but when his son and heir, Gilzeria, was killed in the war of 1999, he was forced to return to the throne. He has been manipulated by Saazbaum into believing that his granddaughter is truly dead, that Slaine is a spy of the Terrans and that he must officially rekindle the war on Earth. After 19 months his health worsens to the point where he no longer recognizes his surroundings, and before passing away, he has one last talk with Asseylum, remembering when he found the Aldnoah technology and how he wanted to use it to improve all of mankind. ; : :The second Princess of the Vers Empire, Rayregalia's other granddaughter and Asseylum's younger half- sister. The two princesses share the same paternal lineage, but have different mothers. She hates her royal heritage and even though she knows she is only a tool to activate the Aldnoah Drive, she continues with her mission since it makes her feel useful, befriending Slaine and later fall in love with him. She also pretends to be Asseylum in a message that urges to continue the war, with only Inaho suspecting she is an impostor. Her lower limbs are weak and she has to rely on a wheel chair for mobility. However, she could use her legs like a normal person in low gravity environment. Her relationship to her half-sister is not close. Music The series' soundtrack was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano. The first soundtrack album was released on September 10, 2014 featuring 20 tracks, including vocal performances by Aimee Blackschleger, Cyua, Mika Kobayashi, and mpi.

Synopsis  Donkey Punch is divided into four scenes that are each roughly thirty minutes in length and which consist of vaginal and anal intercourse, as well as acts such as irrumatio, cunnilingus, anilingus, and penetration with fingers and toes. Throughout each sequence, the male performers slap, punch, gag, kick, stomp, strangle, yell at, pull the hair of, and spit on their female co-stars. The segments conclude with the actor ejaculating into the actress's anus as he repeatedly strikes the back of the woman's head (the eponymous \\"donkey punches\\"). The exception to this is the third scene, which ends prematurely due to Alex Devine forcing Steven French (who she had repeatedly requested remove his ring, and to not punch \\"the wrong side\\" of her head) to stop. This leads to a short intermission (shot by French) in which directors Grip and Cram Johnson mock Devine, making statements like, \\"This fucking bitch, fucked up the most important part of the movie!\\" and \\"There's no wrong spot to hit a woman!\\" as they have Devine lick up French's semen. Scenes * Deja Dare and Steven French * Rachel Luv and Alex Sanders * Alex Devine and Steven French.

A 4/5 was given by Rancho Carne, which stated, \\"If you want it rough, just come on over to JM/Chatsworth and get your fill. Slapping, choking, spitting, it's all here. ... After the punching, everything else is kind of plain\\". The viciousness of the film prompted Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews to forego covering any further releases from JM, while Zack Parsons of Something Awful (which awarded Donkey Punch a near-\\"perfect\\" score of -49) wrote that the film was \\"one of the most morally repugnant pornographic movies I have seen\\" and \\"is the sort of movie that the government would cite when trying to arrest pornographers and outlaw pornography\\".

The Catholic parish in the adjoining city of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan served Catholics for several years until a wooden church was constructed for the Parish of the Sacred Heart in 1846. In 1875, the present church building opened, as the region's Catholic population, mainly of French Canadian and Irish immigrant origin, began to grow rapidly. Following the creation of the dioceses in 1904, this facility was elevated to cathedral status.

Originally, species concept, as refined by Darwin472 consisted of C. columna. Spengler's 1790 description included specimens from \\"Otaheite\\" (Tahiti), which were far larger than any of the three described species. As Chamaesipho is restricted to Australia and New Zealand, and Spengler's Tahiti material lacked opercular plates, it is no longer included as Chamaesipho. Spengler's written description agrees with Chamaesipho.472 Spengler's Tahiti material is thought to be New Zealand Epopella, mislabeled. Later authors recognized Chamaesipho columna populations really represented three species. Moore, 1944, recognized a second New Zealand population with sufficient anatomical differences to warrant description as Chamaesipho brunnea. The two species substantially overlap, and are sympatric. Australian Chamaesipho' specimens were seen to represent a third species, which was proposed as Chamaesipho tasmanica. Neither New Zealand species occurs naturally in Australia. Chamaesipho columna, view of crowded colony in situ  Description and Discussion  Adult shells are very small, rostrocarinal diameter of not more than 9 mm in solitary specimens, 4 mm in columnar growth individuals. Height of crowded individuals reaches to 16 mm, 6 mm in solitary specimens. The shell is whitish, and erodes to show pitting. Juvenile shell wall of 6 plates, becoming four plated by diameter of .5mm, and sutures fuse together, cannot be seen in adult, even when etched with acid. Basis is membraneous. Opercular plates are deeply interlocked with sinuous articulation, and subject to considerable environmental wear, making large variations in individual appearance and shape.471 Articulation is not nearly as deep as in Chamaesipho brunnea. Interior of scutum shows a wide shallow adductor pit, and small lateral depressor pit. There is a distinct low rounded scutal adductor ridge, in contrast to that of C. brunnea, which has at best poorly developed ridge. Scutal articular ridge, which in chthamaloids is large central lobe on tergal margin, is rounded. In C. brunnea, this lobe is very large and rectangular. The tergum is much narrower than in C. brunnea, with articular margin bearing two rounded relatively shallow re-entrants. Chamaesipho brunnea shows a single very deep re-entrant. Tergal depressor crests are prominent in both species, with fewer (to about four) in C. columna, versus up to seven in C. brunnea. Crests are not visible from exterior in C. columna. Neither species shows a tergal spur. Moore, 1944 provides full descriptions of hard- and soft-part anatomy for both juvenile and adult stages of C. columna.  Nomenclature and synonymy  * Lepas columna Spengler, 1790, original description * Chamaesipho columna (Spengler). Darwin, 1854 (genetic reassignment, discussion of Spengler's material); Moore, 1944, (emended complete description, description of Chamaesipho brunnea); Newman & Ross, 1976, (complete reference list to 1976); Foster and Anderson, 1986 (modification of description, separating Australian occurrences as Chamaesipho tasmanica); Poltarukha, 2006 (post 1976 synonymy, emended description). * The type locality is given as Otaheite by Spengler. Otaheite is now known as Tahiti. It is unlikely Tahitian material is Chamaesipho, which genus as presently defined, is unknown outside of New Zealand and Australia. * The type specimen repository is specimen illustrated in Pl. 6, fig. 6 of Spengler (1790) was selected by Foster & Anderson (1986) as plesiotype. No opercular plates were present. Illustration was reproduced in Foster & Anderson (1986) as Fig. 1A.  Vernacular names  It is locally known as the \\"column barnacle\\", after its shell form in crowded colonies.  Geographical and environmental data  Chamaesipho columna is found in all New Zealand waters except the Chatham Islands. Much of its range overlaps that of C. brunnea, and in those areas, C. columna will be found below the zone of C. brunnea in higher intertidal. In addition, C. columna will colonize areas more protected from direct wave action. C. brunnea prefers the highest areas most exposed to wave action. Both species overwhelmingly prefer rocky or shell substrates, rarely wood. Unlike nearly all other chthamaloids, C. columna occasionally enters tidal estuaries, but not as far as to encounter brackish or muddy water.

A strange girl named Xu Jin Ling (Betty Sun) possessing a powerful yueqin, which doubles as a weapon for self-defense, offends the prominent businessman, Mr. Zhao (Guo Degang), by humiliating his niece using said musical instrument. As punishment for this act of insolence, Mr. Zhao arranges the marriage between Jin Ling and their home village's ugliest resident, Mao Dai Long (Suet Lam). However, Mr. Zhao's lecherous and conniving cousin, Shi Wen Sheng (Ronald Cheng), takes notice of the beautiful girl, and plots with Mr. Zhao to be rid of Mao Dai Long so that Jin Ling will become Wen Sheng's wife. An unexpected turn of events occur, however, because when Dai Long introduces Jin Ling to his little stepbrother, Mao Song (Cheng Yee Kin), they immediately recognize each other, as they have met each other a long time ago when they were but children. Another series of unexpected events start happening in this seemingly uneventful village, as when Mao Song is helpless to save Dai Long from the crime he was framed by Wen Sheng for and is unable to save Jin Ling from becoming Wen Sheng's wife, he runs into two oddly dressed men, to whom the audience is introduced to as two space aliens named Tranzor and Shakespeare of Planet B16, but introduce themselves to the destitute and somewhat suicidal man as two immortal fairies who will help him address his grievances. For the moment, it seemed as if everything was going the way Mao Song wanted, but things then take a turn for the worse when Jin Ling runs away from home since she refuses adamantly to acknowledge the hideous-looking Dai Long as her husband, though Dai Long didn't really care about that, Mr. Zhao and Wen Sheng hire the 108 Bandits, who are portrayed in this movie not as valiant heroes, but as money-grubbing mercenaries, to kill Jin Ling, and an alien martial artist (Hu Ge) who has been living undercover among humanity for decades and serves a powerful warlord of Planet B16 named the Black Emperor, is finally activated and deployed to assassinate Mao Song, for Mao Song is, in reality, a B16 Alien who's the legitimate heir to the leadership of B16, but was abandoned on Earth by his family under the guise of a human child so that the Black Emperor won't be able to find him. A great chase occurs with the 108 Bandits being the pursuers and Mao Song and Jin Ling, whose face was horrendously scarred by an acid spray from one of the Bandits, being the quarry. They manage to elude the mercenaries, but Jin Ling attempts to commit suicide by falling off a cliff, as she was unwilling to be married to Mao Song now that her face was rendered hideous, and she was on tenterhooks that Mao Song would have to endure humiliation and being the back end of nasty comments and jokes for marrying such an ugly girl. Mao Song jumped into the dark abyss after her, intending to die alongside her, and it was in this moment that his identity as the leader of Planet B16 had been realized, and when they were seconds away from hitting the bottom, Mao Song sprouted wings of light from his back, flew back up the cliff, and healed Jin Ling's face in the meantime, making her face beautiful again. In this scene, everybody, except for Tranzor and Shakespeare who are drunk at a brothel, shows up; Mr. Zhao and Wen Sheng show up, hidden in the forest behind the cliff's edge, the 108 Bandits stand by the cliff's edge, staring in awe and wonder at the space ship that was rising out of the ground behind Mao Song and Jin Ling, Mao Dai Long appears, following the yueqin that transformed into a hovering robot probe, and the alien assassin, who was disguised as a female school teacher, shows up to kill Mao Song. A duel takes place at the bottom of the cliff, with the alien assassin and Mao Song seeming equally matched, but Mao Song at the last moment turned the tide of the battle in his favor by borrowing the strengths and fighting skills of all the 108 Bandits. After defeating this foe, Mao Song flies back up to the ship where he weds his beloved and offers the 108 Bandits new homes and jobs on Planet B16. Mao Dai Long remains in China with two pretty B16 girls to be his wives after they altered his appearance to make him handsome, and Mr. Zhao and Wen Sheng lament on their mistakes. At the very end of the movie, the people of the village are seen everywhere lighting incense sticks in honor of a jade Buddha statue they erected some time after witnessing the B16 space ship rising from the ground, which bore a strong resemblance to the Buddha when they saw it from a distance. Reception As of 16 February, it had grossed US$4.63 million.

Early years The Cuirassier (1807) on the entablement of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel Auguste-Marie Taunay was born in Paris in 1768. He studied sculpture under Jean Guillaume Moitte (1746‚Äì1810) at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. At the age of 24 he was awarded the first prize for Sculpture, the Prix de Rome, on 1 September 1792 for a bas-relief. Due to the turmoil of the early phases of the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799) he did not travel to Rome. He worked as a sculptor at the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres, a porcelain works, from 1802 to 1807. He decorated the Louvre Palace stairway and made a statue of The Cuirassier (1807) for the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel. Between 1808 and 1814 he exhibited in several Salons. He made a well-known statue of Napoleon with his arms crossed. Brazil Taunay was a member of the Miss√£o Art√≠stica Francesa (French Artistic Mission) organized by Joachim Lebreton which brought a group of artists to Brazil, arriving on 25 March 1816. These included the painter Jean-Baptiste Debret (1768-1848), Auguste's brother the painter Nicolas Antoine Taunay (1755-1830), the engraver Charles-Simon Pradier (1786-1847)), the sculptor Marc Ferrez (1788-1850), his brother the engraver Zepherin Ferrez (1797-1851) and the architect Auguste-Henri-Victor Grandjean de Montigny (1776-1850). They were to form the nucleus of a royal art academy in Brazil. The arrival of the French group caused some controversy among the local Portuguese intelligentsia, who were concerned at the excessive influence being given to the French in developing the cultural life of Brazil. In turn, the French were unhappy with political appointments such as the appointment of Henrique Jos√© da Silva as head of the school in place of Lebreton. This was the reason why Tauney's brother, Nicholas Antoine Taunay, returned to France. Taunay was appointed professor of sculpture at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Rio, but did not take up the post. In 1818 he worked with Grandjean de Montigny and Debret on the decorations of the Largo do Pa√ßo for the celebrations of the accession of King John VI of Portugal. For this he made a sculpture of Minerva protecting the Bust of the Monarch with her Aegis. He made a plaster bust of Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, now held by the Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute in Rio de Janeiro. Taunay died in Rio de Janeiro in 1824. Works The best-known works of Taunay include: *Jean-Baptiste Muiron, chef de battalion (1774-1796), marble bust, in the Palace of Versailles *Antoine-Louis-Charles, comte de Lasalle-g√©n√©ral (1775-1809), marble sculpture, 1st Empire period (1804-1814) (height ), in the Palace of Versailles *Bust of Antoine-Louis-Charles, Earl Lasalle, General Division (1775-1809), modeled in plaster, in the Palace of Versailles *Decoration of the Escalier du Midi in the Louvre *Decoration of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel File:Antoine-Louis-Charles.jpgAntoine Charles Louis de Lasalle, French cavalry General during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars known as ‚ÄúThe Hussar General\\" File:Arc de triomphe du carrousel frontispice.jpgUpper frieze with sculptures of soldiers: Taunay's cuirassier (left), Corbet's dragoon, Joseph Chinard's horse grenadier and Jacques-Edme Dumont's sapper.

Adolphe Gutmann (originally Wilhelm Adolf Gutmann) (12 January 1819 ‚Äì 22 October 1882) was a German pianist and composer who was a pupil and friend of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. Life Gutmann was born in Heidelberg. He came to Paris in 1834, at the age of 15, to study with Chopin, becoming one of the composer's favourites. He performed in concert with Chopin, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Pierre-Joseph Zimmerman, Alkan's transcription of part of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony at a concert of 1838. Gutmann was also the dedicatee of Chopin's Scherzo, Op. 39, published in 1839. Gutmann acted as copyist for a number of Chopin's works, and acted as a courier to take Chopin's letters to his family in Warsaw. Gutmann's own set of Etudes (his Op. 12) is dedicated to Chopin. He was present at Chopin's death bed and preserved the glass from which Chopin took his last drink of water. Both he and Alkan were bequeathed the notes that Chopin had compiled in preparation for a piano teaching method. Gutmann died in La Spezia. Works Inspired by the style of his master, Gutmann is the author of several nocturnes, and twelve studies, studies characteristics that seem to announce the coming of Impressionism (two of his studies are called Sea, and The Storm, and are respective replicas of the study No. 1, Op. 25, by Chopin, and the R√©volutionnaire).

Life  His father was a glazier. As a student at elementary school, he took art lessons from Johann Baptist Pflug until the age of thirteen. At that time, he was apprenticed to the book publisher Georg Ebner in Stuttgart where he received lessons in business, as well as drawing and engraving. He was self-taught as a lithographer and was allowed to work independently, even during his apprenticeship. After that, he became a student of Johann Friedrich Dieterich. During these years he produced many genre paintings based on sketches by other artists. Thanks to a royal grant, he travelled through Italy for a year, then settled in Munich in 1836, where he spent another year studying at the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1837, he passed his final examinations. Although he was now married, he continued to lead a wandering life, travelling throughout the Rhine Valley, Southern Germany, Italy and Austria, producing lithographs of all the areas he visited. In 1854, he resettled in Munich. His son and his wife both died in 1873. He remarried shortly thereafter and returned to Stuttgart. He was there for only five years, however, before he moved again; back to his home town of Biberach, where he died from a fit of apoplexy.

Description Dun Mor () is situated on a rocky knoll on the northern coast of island of Tiree, about 1 kilometre northwest of the hamlet of Vaul. The broch consists of a drystone tower with an internal diameter of 9.2 metres with walls about 4.5 metres thick. The outer face of the wall survives to a maximum height of 2.2 metres. The entrance is on the southeast side. On the north side of the entrance passage is a small side-chamber, of a type usually called a \\"guard cell\\". The intramural cavity is well-preserved, and there are the remains of a staircase, which led to the upper levels, on the north side. The broch was additionally protected by two outer lines of defence, one drawn round the irregular margin of the summit on all sides, and the other taking the form of a hornwork which restricted access from the landward side of the knoll. Excavations The broch was partly excavated around 1880, and it was almost completely excavated by E. W. MacKie in 1962-4. The excavations showed that there had been two phases of occupation before the broch was built. In the earliest phase (5th century BC) there appears to have been a wooden hut, which may have been destroyed by fire. This was followed by a more extensive settlement occupying a larger proportion of the summit area. After an interval of unknown duration (possibly several centuries) the knoll was reoccupied and the construction of the broch and its outworks began. The construction of the broch was dated by radiocarbon dating to the 1st century AD. It appears to have been used initially as a communal refuge, but by the 2nd century it had become instead the permanent residence of a single family. Before long the upper storeys of the broch wall were demolished, and a round house (or an aisled wheel-house) was constructed within the interior. It seems the broch was abandoned in the mid 3rd-century, the latest datable artefact from the interior being a fragment of a Roman glass bowl made in the Rhineland between 160 and 250 AD. The finds include large quantities of native pottery sherds; fragments of Roman glass and samian-ware and coarse-ware vessels; bronze and silver spiral finger-rings; rotary querns; quartzite strike-lights; glass ring-beads; tools and dice of bone; and several tools used in weaving and the working of metals. The finds are now in the Hunterian Museum, University of Glasgow. ReferencesFurther reading *Euan W. Mackie, (1975), Dun Mor Vaul: An Iron Age Broch on Tiree. University of Glasgow. *Euan W.

During a home match against Austria Wien the Austrian goalkeeper Franz Wohlfahrt was struck by a metal iron rod which was launched onto the pitch by the Ajax hooligan firm F-side. As a result, Ajax had to concede the match by default and were excluded from competing in European football for a year. Earlier that year, Ajax chairman Ton Harmsen was succeeded by Michael van Praag, the son of Harmsen's predecessor Jaap van Praag. Under the initiative of the new chairman, popular Dutch celebrities would accompany the team on match days, in order to promote fair play as public speakers. After Frank Masmeijer and Harry Slinger had previously accompanied the team on a match, it was Dutch comedian Freek de Jonge's turn during the UEFA Cup match between Ajax and Austria Wien. Ajax had already lost the away match against Austria Wien 1‚Äì0 and therefore would need at least 1‚Äì0 victory at home. At the time of the match Austria were in the news regarding the war history of the country's president at the time Kurt Waldheim, during World War II, where he was involved in deportations and actions against partisans, which he had concealed in his autobiography. Phonecall for Waldheim Freek De Jonge started the evening as a host with an innocent joke about Ajax defender Danny Blind, before the second half of the match he staged a phone call to Mr. Waldheim, who was invited by Simon Wiesenthal to call back. After 90'-minutes of play Ajax were up 1‚Äì0, but during extra time Austria Wien were able to equalize which would ultimately lead to the ejection of Ajax. The hooligan firm F-side of Ajax began to chant: \\"Nazis! Nazis!\\", and 17-year-old Ajax-supporter Gerald M.Niet zijn werkelijke naam; zie Staafgooier bij Ajax ‚Äì Austria Wien spreekt door Hans Janssen, op Sportgeschiedenis.nl 30 oktober 2006 (eerder verschenen in De Ajacied 2004). launched a metal rod onto the pitch, out of the stands which would inevitably hit Austria Wien keeper Franz Wohlfahrt in the back, after which the match was halted at a score of 1‚Äì1. The next day De Jonge expressed to the press his regret in making his comments, but denied any responsibility for the actions that occurred in the stadium henceforth.De Jonge: 'Spijt van opmerking' Leeuwarder Courant 29 September 1989 According to Nico Scheepmaker, De Jonge had gone too far, following his previous comments on the Hillsborough disaster as well as the 1977 Dutch school hostage crisis.Potje mosterd Leeuwarder Courant 28 September 1989; in zijn Trijfel-column verwart Scheepmaker de gijzeling in Bovensmilde met de treinkaping bij De Punt Consequences Ajax lost the home match by default with a score line of 3‚Äì0 after the actions that took place, and were subsequently banned from competing in European football for two years due to the incident (1990‚Äì1992).

He spent his early life in northern Illinois, and the 1960s on the Pacific Coast. In the early-1970s he moved to Maine, where he lived until his death while traveling across the US. Koller is the author of more than thirty books of poetry. He has also published three novels and numerous essays. His writing has been translated into Italian, French, Spanish, German and Swedish. He began performing his work in the US in 1959, and starting in the late-1970s appeared widely in western Europe, often accompanied by others, notably the late Swiss poet and artist Franco Beltrametti, the German poet Stefan Hyner and the folk musician Governor Clay. He was publisher of Coyote Books and Coyote's Journal since 1964. Many of his Beat, Black Mountain and San Francisco contemporaries (Ed Dorn, Charles Olson, Gary Snyder, Joanne Kyger, Allen Ginsberg) have appeared in these publications. Koller was also active in the bio-regional and ecological movements. Life and career The son of an engraver, Koller began his involvement in the arts in the 1950s with vocational training in photography. In 1964, while living in Washington state, he became poetry editor of the Northwest Review (the University of Oregon's literary magazine) at Philip Whalen's suggestion, only to see the magazine suspended after publishing an issue featuring Fidel Castro and Antonin Artaud. Soon after, with fellow editors Ed Van Aelstyn and Will Wroth, he founded Coyote's Journal. Koller's first book, Two Hands, was published in 1965 in Seattle, by James B. Smith. He moved to northern California in that year. His poetry appeared in reviews (The Floating Bear, Locus Solus, The Paris Review, The Rivoli Review), and additional books followed: from Toad Press (Eugene, Oregon), Four Seasons (San Francisco), and Black Sparrow (Los Angeles). Koller remained in the Bay Area into the 1970s, and at times joined the Diggers in putting out their Haight-Ashbury free broadsides. After his time in California, Koller lived for a while in Santa Fe, New Mexico, but mostly stayed on the move. In 1976 Koller was invited to England to read his work at the Cambridge Poetry Festival alongside Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, Seamus Heaney, Jean Daive and Jacques Roubaud. Afterward, he embarked on the first of many European tours, accompanied by the late Franco Beltrametti and Harry Hoogstraten. He and Beltrametti made their first poetry tour in the US in 1977. From then on he criss-crossed both Europe and America, giving readings. From 1987 to 1989, he performed Graffiti Lyriques with Beltrametti from Bologna to Stockholm. Since the 1989 Chicago performance of The Bone Show with composer Peter Garland, Koller has regularly appeared and been recorded in the US and Europe with American musician/songwriter Governor Clay. In 2003 he toured the US with German poet Stefan Hyner. In 2005 he performed The Bone Show with Silvana Mariniello in Rome. While editor of Coyote's Journal and Coyote Books since 1964, Koller also edited the book review Otherwise from 1994 to 1997. He taught a course on the Icelandic sagas with Stefan Hyner and Reidar Ekner in B√∏ i Telemark, Norway, 2001. He was also active as an artist and photographer (exhibitions in Portland, Maine; Santa Fe, New Mexico; New York City and Rome, Italy).

After it was no longer used as a place of worship, it found a new use as a carpet warehouse.Website of the Friends of Masbro Chapel and Walker Mausoleum, www.walkermausoleum.co.uk Retrieved 20 August 2014 The building suffered two serious fires in 2012, and it was demolished in December 2012. The chapel was closely associated with the Walker family who were leading industrialists in Rotherham. The Walker Mausoleum stands in the chapel's burial ground and the Mausoleum is itself a Listed building. The chapel was also closely associated with the Rotherham Independent Academy, a training school for ministers, founded in 1795. Later in the 19th century, the Academy moved from Masbrough to new premises built in \\"collegiate gothic\\" style on Moorgate Road, Rotherham. Wadsworth, KW, Yorkshire United Independent College Independent Press, London, 1954 The Moorgate Road premises are now occupied by the Thomas Rotherham College. In 1795, Dr Edward Williams took the pastorate at the chapel and also became the first theological tutor at the then newly formed Rotherham Independent Academy which was built nearby. Joshua and Thomas Walker were generous benefactors to the Academy. Williams had been one of those involved in the formation in 1794 of the missionary society that was later named London Missionary Society. Williams preached the charge to the first missionaries sent out by the society. During the ministry of the Reverend Thomas Nicholson (served 1879‚Äì1900) the worshipping congregation grew from 225 to 530. During the Depression of the 1920s and 30s, the congregation organized the construction of a bowling green on land near the chapel by un- employed men, for their recreational enjoyment, and classes in boot repair and other things were held to help them through the Depression. During the 1950s, the chapel's minister Cyril Grant provided ministerial oversight for the formation and development of a new church at Herringthorpe, the church that is now the Herringthorpe United Reformed Church. This work first started in hired rooms at the Herringthorpe Junior School, later moving into its own purpose- built premises on Wickersley Road, adjacent to the Stag Inn. Early history=The Walker Family, Ironmasters Three brothers Jonathan (1710‚Äì1778), Samuel (1715‚Äì1782) and Aaron (1718‚Äì1777) Walker came to the Masbrough area in 1746. Aaron was a farm worker who, together with a relative John Crawshaw, had begun experimenting with smelting and casting, in about 1741. Samuel was a schoolmaster at Grenoside and he also did some land-surveying and made sun- dials before going into business with his brothers. The brothers built casting houses, furnaces and a smithy in the Masbrough area. A water-powered forge was built in 1754 and in 1758 a blast furnace and a rolling mill. In just a few decades, they built the business into one of biggest iron and steel concerns in the country, and became the leading Ironmasters in the North. Cannon in the ships of the English fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) had been made in the Walker family's factories. These brothers (Jonathan, Samuel and Aaron) were the sons (by his second wife, Anne Hargreave) of Joseph Walker (1673‚Äì1729), a nailmaker of Grenoside. Samuel and Aaron were early converts to the 18th century religious revival or awakening in which George Whitfield, John Wesley, Charles Wesley, the Countess of Huntingdon and others were leading figures. In the mid-1700s, a doctrinal difference among the adherents of the movement led to two distinct streams. The controversy began to develop after John Wesley had preached a sermon in Bristol (1739) titled \\"Free Grace\\", in which he espoused theological doctrines known as Arminian. Samuel and Aaron followed the Calvinism of Whitfield and Lady Huntingdon, rather than the Arminianism of the Wesley brothers. John Thorp John Thorp was one of a group of men drinking in a tavern when the group decided that as a wager each of them in turn would mockingly imitate the earnest evangelistic preaching style of the Awakening. John was last of the group to perform and he vowed to easily out-perform the others, and to win the wager. During his \\"preaching\\" John became earnest and dropped his buffoonery. He found himself speaking in sincerity words he had intended mockingly. The hearers fell silent as they became aware of the change that had come upon him. John's life was transformed and he dedicated himself to the ministry of the Gospel. Gathering of the Masbrough congregation The Masbrough congregation was gathered in or about 1760, with John Thorp as its first minister. In 1762/3, Samuel and Aaron built the first Meetinghouse. Thorp remained in post as minister for sixteen years, until his death in 1776. Change of name The word \\"Independent\\" (a word that, in this context, signifies Congregational) was dropped from the chapel's name in the 1970s when the congregation acceded to the United Reformed Church. Thereafter, it was known simply as \\"Masbro Chapel\\", or (more formally) as \\"Masbro Chapel (United Reformed)\\".

Ofsted In May and June 2019 Ofsted inspectors called and found, like its predecessor the management and leadership of the school was inadequate. They found they were tardy in addressing weaknesses and failed to evaluate any improvement scheme they introduced. They found that special needs teaching was weak as was mathematics and felt that work was pitched at too lower level of difficulty, as some teachers had low expectations of pupils. In all other areas strategies were found to be ineffective. The governors did not hold leaders to account for low standards as they lacked the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out their delegated duties. A monitoring visit was made in February 2020, where inspectors found the leaders and managers are taking effective actions facilitating the removal of the serious weaknesses designation. They found both the schools and the trusts improvement plans are fit for purpose.

Work Jenkins is best known for her multidisciplinary installations that combine video, audio, sculpture, and performance to create immersive environments. Familial relationships, home, sexuality, and the male/female identity are the recurrent themes of her intimate, visceral, and often personal, narratives. Jenkins was one of the initial artists in the early 1990s to use video sculpture to create intimate artworks that belie their technology.Rush, Michael. New Media in Late 20th-Century Art. Thames and Hudson, 1999, In her investigations of female identity, miniature objects have played a vital role in Jenkins' videos and multimedia installations. In her video installation Ebb (1996), Jenkins projects an image of a female bathing in red water‚Äîsuggesting blood‚Äîonto a tiny claw-foot tub on the top of a ceramic-tiled pedestal. As the video progresses, the water in the tub gradually becomes clear, creating the surprisingly realistic illusion that the blood is unnaturally seeping back into her body‚Äîa reversal of the menstrual cycle.

It is a technical standard developed by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and approved by the American National Standards Institute with the code Z39.96-2012. The NISO project was a continuation of the work done by NLM/NCBI, and popularized by the NLM's PubMed Central as a de facto standard for archiving and interchange of scientific open-access journals and its contents with XML. With the NISO standardization the NLM initiative has gained a wider reach, and several other repositories, such as SciELO and Redalyc, adopted the XML formatting for scientific articles. The JATS provides a set of XML elements and attributes for describing the textual and graphical content of journal articles as well as some non-article material such as letters, editorials, and book and product reviews.ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 . See z39.96-2012.pdf at www.niso.org/standards/z39-96-2012 JATS allows for descriptions of the full article content or just the article header metadata; and allows other kinds of contents, including research and non-research articles, letters, editorials, and book and product reviews.  History  Since its introduction, NCBI's NLM Archiving and Interchange DTD suite has become the de facto standard for journal article markup in scholarly publishing. With the introduction of NISO JATS, it has been elevated to a true standard. Even without public data interchange, the advantages of NISO JATS adoption affords publishers in terms of streamlining production workflows and optimizing system interoperability.  Timeline  ; NLM JATS : NLM JATS, version 1 :* :* : NLM JATS, version 2 :* :* :* :* : NLM JATS, version 3 :* ; NISO JATS : NISO JATS, version 1.0 :* :* :* :* : NISO JATS, version 1.1 :* :* :* :* :* :* : NISO JATS, version 1.2 :* :* :* Technical scope By design, this is a model for journal articles, such as the typical research article found in an STM journal, and not a model for complete journals.  Tag sets  The 3 specifications. Due to their color-coded documentation, are colloquially referred to by color. There are three tag sets: ; Journal Archiving and Interchange () : \\"The most permissive of the Tag Sets,\\" primarily intended for the capture and archiving of extant journal data. ; Journal Publishing () : \\"A moderately prescriptive Tag Set,\\" intended for general use in journal production and publication. : Formally this model is a subset of the Archiving model. This is the most frequently used JATS variant. ; Article Authoring () : \\"The most prescriptive [tightest and smallest] of the Tag Sets,\\" intended for the relatively lightweight creation of journal articles valid to JATS. : Formally this model a subset of the Publishing model. Document type definitions (also released in the form of RELAX NG and XML schema) define each set and incorporate other standards such as MathML and XHTML Tables (although not in the XHTML namespace).  Document structure  JATS Publishing set defines a document that is a top-level component of a journal such as an article, a book or product review, or a letter to the editor. Each such document is composed of front matter (required) and up to three optional parts. These must appear in the following order: ; Front matter : The article front matter contains the metadata for the article (also called article header information), for example, the article title, the journal in which it appears, the date and issue of publication for that issue of that journal, a copyright statement, etc. Both article-level and issue-level metadata (in the element \`\`) and journal-level metadata (in the element \`\`) may be captured. ; Body (of the article) : The body of the article is the main textual and graphic content of the article. This usually consists of paragraphs and sections, which may themselves contain figures, tables, sidebars (boxed text), etc. The body of the article is optional to accommodate those repositories that just keep article header information and do not tag the textual content. ; Back matter : If present, the article back matter contains information that is ancillary to the main text, such as a glossary, appendix, or list of cited references. ; Floating material : A publisher may choose to place all the floating objects in an article and its back matter (such as tables, figures, boxed text sidebars, etc.) into a separate container element outside the narrative flow for convenience of processing. Following the front, body, back, and floating material, there may be either one or more responses to the article or one or more subordinate articles.  Example  This is the minimal article's structure, ... ... ... The \`DOCTYPE\` header is optional, a legacy from SGML and DTD-oriented validators. The \`dtd-version\` attribute can be used even without a DTD header. The root element \`article\` is common for any version of JATS or \\"JATS family\\", as NLM DTDs. The rules for \`front\`, \`body\` and \`back\` tags validation, depends on the JATS version, but all versions have similar structure, with good compatibility in a range of years. The evolution of the schema preserves an overall stability. Less common, \\"only \`front\`\\", \\"only \`front\` and \`back\`\\" variations are also used for other finalities than full- content representation. The general article composition (as an DTD-content expression) is (front, body?, back?, floats-group?, (sub-article*  response*))  Tools  There are a variety of tools for create, edit, convert and transform JATS.

Born in Barcelona, she founded the Capuchin Poor Clares of Zaragoza and Murcia. She died in Murcia and was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 23 May 1982. Early life She was born into a comfortable family where she was the youngest of her four siblings. Her father, Crist√≥bal Cortey, sold books for a living; her mother, Catalina Astroch, was the universal heir of Pedro Miguel Astroch, with the condition that all of her offspring would keep her last name. Both parents died within four years, leaving Maria an orphan in the care of her housekeeper in Sarria. In 1599 she was found poisoned and left for dead. Her sister Isabel Astorch, who was a nun in the newly founded Monasterio de Capuchinas (Capuchin Monastery) in Barcelona, attended the funeral with the founder of the monastery, Angela Serafin Prat. Amid preparations for the funeral Maria came back to life, the miracle was attributed to the prayers of her sister Angela. After her revival she acquired an advanced maturity and showed tremendous potential, it gave the impression that she was a highly gifted child. She learned to read and to work hard; she also had a great love of reading, especially books in Latin. Life in the monastery On 16 September 1603, at age 11, she entered the monastery of St. Margaret of Barcelona, founded by Mother Angela Serafina Prat. She did it with the six volumes of the Breviary in Latin, which she had already mastered. Despite her early maturity, she had to wait until 1608 for the recruitment to end, a wait made difficult by misunderstanding and envy of the teacher, who came to abuse her; eventually because of her maturity and culture, she was commissioned to give some training to their colleagues. In the end Mother Angela Serafina ended up deposing the master and putting in place Astorch Isabel, Maria Angela's sister. She became the teacher on 8 September 1609. In 1612 she was appointed to join the community council. Foundation of Zaragoza The monastery of Santa Margarita became a thriving focus of foundations. On 19 May 1614 Maria Angela was released, along with five others, to a religious foundation in Zaragoza, which opened on 24 May the same year. During her years at Zaragoza, Maria Angela served as mistress of novices (1614-1623); teacher of young professed (1623-1626); and Abbess (1626-1642), for which it was necessary to ask for dispensation to Rome because she was not of the canonical minimum age. At this time also she devoted herself to writing small works of a spiritual nature. One of her greatest accomplishments was getting approval from Pope Urban VIII in 1627, constitutions which governed the life of the Capuchins of Zaragoza and the derived monasteries for three centuries. Other tasks performed by sister Maria Angela included meeting those who approached the monastery asking for advice or looking for consolation, including some bishops and Cardinal Teodoro Trivulzio, Aragon Viceroy, who would maintain the epistolary relationship to return to Italy. Spiritual life Mar√≠a Angela's spiritual progress has been preserved in the \\"autobiographical stories\\" and \\"Accounts of spirit\\". In them she tells of mystical experiences that occurred between the years 1626-1656. One of the confessors commanded her to read Mystics in vogue at the time - such as Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, and Jes√∫s Tom√°s - to see if she felt she identified any of them. Mar√≠a Angela's response was negative. Her experience is similar to that of Saint Gertrude of Helfta. Pope John Paul II called her liturgical spirituality, scriptural and patristic, \\"the mystique of the Breviary\\" in his beatification, as well as a great devotion to the passion and the heart of Jesus. Foundation in Murcia In 1640 Sister Maria Angela was considering the possibility of founding again. It was not until 9 June 1645, that she would be accompanied by four others to Murcia. On 29 June of the same year the monastery of the exaltation of the Holy Sacrament was opened. Maria Angela was again the master of novices and Abbess. Among his disciples was Sor √örsula Micaela Morata, who would be the founder of the monastery of Alicante in 1672. During her years in Murcia Maria Angela had to face difficult moments, especially the plague of 1648[1] and overflows of the river Segura in 1651 and 1653.[2] Death and beatification An engraving of Maria Angela Astorch made in the 18th century In 1655 Maria Angela stopped writing with the thought of her upcoming death. She had begun losing mental faculties in 1660, regressing to a childlike state. In 1661, she resigned from the position of Abbess. On 21 November 1665, she suffered a hemiplegia, never fully regaining her mental faculties. She died on December 2 of that year after receiving the sacraments. The city of Murcia turned out to her burial, as the people had great esteem for the \\"mother foundress\\", as she was popularly known. She was given a burial on land, in the bass choir. The Diocesan process for her beatification was begun in 1668, concluding in 1670. In 1683, with permission of the Bishop, her body was exhumed and placed in a niche in the presbytery of the Church. Her body was examined, and they discovered that it remained uncorrupted. Further reviews took place in 1725, 1729 and 1745. A new Diocesan process for her beatification occurred between 1759 and 1771, along with new surveys of the corpse. The promulgation of the Decree of approval of the writings took place in 1773, with the enactment of a second decree of approval taking place in 1776. On 29 September 1850, Maria Angela was declared officially Venerable. In 1936, the process was halted due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Her grave was desecrated and the corpse was taken to the common cemetery, but it was possible to identify it at the end of the war in 1939, thanks to the boldness of a stonemason who separated the remains from those of others, and to Placido Ruiz Molina, the doctor who had observed the corpse before the desecration. In 1979 he returned to present the already approved miracle. New doctors studying it, giving a favourable opinion on 21 February 1980. On 23 May 1982 Maria Angela was beatified by Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square.

Knowledge of human nature can be used to judge people correctly, to motivate them, to give other people good advice, to deepen relationships, etc. However, it can also be used to exploit people to one's own advantage, for example, if one wants to persuade people, to seduce them, or to sell them something.

They were educators, publishers, and public figures of the Albanian National Awakening period. The four members were part of the earliest Protestants in Albania and even today's Kosovo. They are remembered for their activities in support of the consolidation of Albanian national awareness. Members Gjerasim Qiriazi (1858‚Äì1894) attended a Greek school in his native Monastir and, with the assistance of his English teacher, the American missionary Jenney, studied at an American Bible college in Samokov, Bulgaria. After four years of training there, he was offered a job by the British and Foreign Bible Society, for whom he began working in Kor√ßa in 1883. He also began writing an Albanian grammar and is known to have preached in Albanian. On 12 November 1884, while traveling in the mountains southwest of Lake Ohrid, he was attacked by bandits and held for ransom for half a year. The narrative of his six-month ordeal was translated into English by J. W. Baird of Monastir as Captured by Brigands (London, 1902). The opening of the first officially recognized Albanian school in Kor√ßa in 1887 inspired him and his sisters Sevasti Qiriazi-Dako (1871‚Äì1949) and Parashqevi Qiriazi (1880‚Äì1970) to open a girls‚Äô school. With the assistance of Naim Frash√´ri and, in particular, of American and English missionaries, they received the appropriate authorizations in Istanbul and on 15 October 1891 opened the first Albanian girls‚Äô school in Kor√ßa. The following summer, they moved the premises to a larger building to make room for more pupils. The Greek Orthodox hierarchy was fanatically opposed to the school from the start and went so far as to refuse to bury the son of one of its patrons. On 4 January 1894, Gjerasim Qiriazi died, aged 36, of the pleurisy he had contracted during his period of captivity. He was the author of poetry, songs, sketches, dialogues, and school textbooks. A selection of his writings was published by his younger brother Gjergj in the collection Hristomathi m√´ kat√´r pjes√´ (Chrestomathy in Four Parts ; Sofia, 1902). Gjergj Qiriazi (1868‚Äì1912), known in English as George Kyrias, attended a Greek school in his native Monastir and the American Bible college at Samokov, and was hired by the British and Foreign Bible Society like his brother Gjerasim. He took over the direction of the Albanian girls‚Äô school in Kor√ßa upon the death of his brother in 1894 and, in 1908, was a delegate at the Congress of Monastir. The politically active Gjergj Qiriazi was one of the founders of the Albanian language newspaper Bashkim‚Äô i Kombit (Unity of the Nation) in 1909. In addition to his brother‚Äôs chrestomathy, he published a collection of religious verse entitled K√´nk√´ t√´ shenjt√´ruara (Sacred Songs; Sofia, 1906).The Albanian National Awakening 1878-1912 by Stavro Skendi, 1967. pp. 350-353, Princeton University Press, OCLC 397632 Sevasti Qiriazi-Dako (1871‚Äì1949) studied at the prestigious Robert College in Istanbul with the help of Naim bey Frash√´ri, and played an active role in women‚Äôs education. She was the first Albanian woman to study at this American institution, from which she graduated in June 1891. Immediately upon her return to Albania, she was instrumental in the founding of the Kor√ßa girls‚Äô school. After World War I, this school was still known by the family name as the Kyrias School. Sevasti Qiriazi-Dako is said to have published a beginners‚Äô grammar for elementary schools (Monastir, 1912) and edited a series of history texts. With her husband, journalist and writer Christo Anastas Dako, and her sister Parashqevi, she left for Romania and from there immigrated with them to the United States, where she collaborated on the fortnightly periodical Yll‚Äô i m√´ngjezit (The Morning Star). Parashqevi Qiriazi (1880‚Äì1970), also known as Paraskevi D. Kirias, also studied at Robert College in Istanbul, then returned to Albania to teach. In 1909, she published a speller for elementary schools. She later organized both children‚Äôs education and night schools in southern Albania and helped set up the rudiments of a library system. In the United States, she helped found the Yll‚Äô i m√´ngjezit (The Morning Star) society and published the illustrated periodical of the same name, issued in Boston from 1917 to 1920. Parashqevi Qiriazi also took part in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 as a representative of the Albanian American community.

History=Formation and disbandment (1918‚Äì1940) The National Audit Office of Estonia was established on 27 December 1918 with a decision by the Estonian Provincial Assembly. Aleksander Oinas became the first Auditor General on January 6, 1919. Due to the ongoing Estonian War of Independence, a military department was formed under the National Audit Office on January 26, 1919, with an agreement between the Auditor General and the Commander of the Estonian Defence Forces. More departments were formed later that year. On February 5, a law was passed, which determined the tasks of the institution. On May 8, A. Oinas became the Minister of the Interior and Aleksander K√§sk became the acting Auditor General. On July 1, Karl August Einbund was appointed the Auditor General and led the organization until July 30, 1920, when he also became Minister of the Interior. Peeter Reisik took over the position until he was replaced by Ferdinand Vellner on October 11, 1920. On 22 September 1919 the Audit Board of the National Audit Office approved regulations, which stipulated the areas of focus, structure of the organization, mandate and tasks of the Auditor General, composition of the Audit Board, procedures etc. Also, during that year, the audit office was made responsible for overseeing the printing of Estonian money. This meant that the audit office had to send representatives to Finland, where the money was printed. Aleksander Oinas became the Auditor General again on March 17, 1921. On November 16, 1926, he was replaced by Johannes Friedrich Zimmermann. In 1927 a limit was introduced on the number of officials at the audit office. A new Auditor General, Karl Johannes Soonberg (later named Karl Soonp√§√§), was appointed in July 1929. On June 17, 1940, the Soviets occupied Estonia. Karl Soonp√§√§ was released on July 10 and on July 13 Aleksander Aben became acting Auditor General. The National Audit Office was finally disbanded on August 25, 1940. Restoration and present day (1990‚Äìpresent) On May 29, 1989, a working group was established to reorganize the control bodies of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic by the Council of Ministers. By the end of the year the working group had presented a new concept, which envisaged the dissolution of 31 state agencies. Some of the responsibilities of those bodies were to be taken over by a new audit office. During that same year, work began to formulate an act for national auditing. In May 1989, a delegation visited the national audit offices of Finland and Sweden to gain knowledge and experience to draft the new legislation. At the end of the year, another visit was made by Finnish state auditors to Estonia, to present an overview of the Finnish auditing organization. On April 4, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Estonia approved the dismantling of the People's Control Committee system. An attempt was made by a former leader of the People's Control Committee to reverse the decision, but this ultimately failed due to lack of political support. The National Audit Office Act was passed on June 6, 1990, which meant the restoration of the National Audit Office of Estonia. On September 20, Hindrek- Peeter Meri was appointed the Auditor General. On November 1, the institution started its work in the former ESSR Planning Committee building at Suur- Ameerika 1, Tallinn. In February 1991, the office moved to another building at Narva maantee 4. On August 20, 1991, the Republic of Estonia officially declared the restoration of independence. In October 1992, the National Audit Office of Estonia became a member of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, and on 16 April 1993, became a member of EUROSAI. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania signed an agreement on the cooperation of their respective audit offices in October 1994. On 31 October 1997, Hindrek-Peeter Meri's term concluded and Rein S√∂√∂rd temporarily became the acting Auditor General. Juhan Parts took over the position on June 9, 1998. In 2000, the National Audit Office was reorganized with the establishment of three auditing departments, based on the types of audits instead of fields of audit. A new National Audit Office Act was passed on January 29, 2002. By his own request, Juhan Parts was released from his position on October 8, 2002. Until the appointment of a new person, J√ºri K√µrge became the acting Auditor General. On April 1, 2003, Mihkel Oviir was appointed to the position of Auditor General. On February 26, 2008, he started his second term. On April 7, 2013, his second term ended and Alar Karis took over his position. The institution was restructured on October 9, 2017, with the dissolution of previous departments and establishment of the Audit Department and the Development and Administrative Service. On April 9, 2018, Janar Holm became the new Auditor General. Structure The National Audit Office of Estonia is headed by the Auditor General, who is proposed by the President and appointed by the parliament for a term of five years. The institution consists of two main departments - the Audit Department and the Development and Administrative Service. The Audit Department is responsible for carrying out financial, compliance and performance audits. It is led by the Director of Audit, who is responsible for coordinating the work of audit groups, which are in turn led by audit managers. Altogether there are seven audit groups for different areas. The Development and Administrative Service supports the Audit Department and the Auditor General in their tasks. It is led by the Director, who is responsible for coordinating the work of the institution and supporting the Auditor General in various administrative tasks.

This snail lives on islands in the sub-Antarctic region. Its shell is unique among land snails in that the organic shell layers contain no chitin.  Taxonomy  This species was described under the name Helix hookeri by an English conchologist Lovell Augustus Reeve in 1854. The specific name hookeri is in honor of English botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, who collected this snail during the Antarctic expedition led by James Clark Ross. Reeve's type description reads in Latin and in English language as follows: Henry Augustus Pilsbry classified this species as Helix hookeri in 1887Pilsbry H. A. (1887). Manual of Conchology.

(2007). \\"Spatial variation of shell morphometrics in the subantarctic snail Notodiscus hookeri from Crozet and Kerguelen Islands\\". Polar Biology 30: 1571-1578. .  Distribution  Notodiscus hookeri has a wide distribution in the sub-Antarctic region. It is the only native terrestrial gastropod species found in the South Indian Ocean islands and archipelagos, and also in the South Atlantic Province: South Indian Province: * Crozet Islands. For example, Notodiscus hookeri is the only terrestrial snail among about 50 species of native invertebrates in the Crozet Islands. * Kerguelen Islands * Heard Island * Prince Edward Islands South Atlantic Province: * Notodiscus hookeri is limited to South Georgia in the South Atlantic Province. The type locality is the Kerguelen Islands. The land snail Notodiscus hookeri is not an endangered or a protected species.  Shell description  Apertural view of a shell of Notodiscus hookeri.

The round white dot marks the outer periostracum. The double white line is a thick organic layer. The thick white line is the innermost mineralised layer. Scale bar is 10 ¬µm. The shell growth does not stop on reaching sexual maturity, but decelerates considerably, with the biggest shells measuring 7.5‚Äì7.7 mm in size. Large intraspecific variations in shell morphometrics have been reported for this species on Possession Island, with endemic variants being described as local adaptations to environmentally distinct islands. The shape of the shell is depressed. The umbilicus is open. The width of the adult shell is up to 7.5-7.77 mm. The weight of the snail of the shell length 6.13 mm is 52.88 mg. The micro structure of the shell was analysed by Charrier et al. (2013). Their study was the first to demonstrate that gastropod shell micro structure responds to environmental heterogeneity, leading to the formation of ecophenotypes. The adults of Notodiscus hookeri have evolved into two ecophenotypes, which the authors referred as MS (mineral shell) and OS (organic shell): * The MS- ecophenotype is characterised by a thick but small mineralised shell. This ecophenotype is primarily found along the coastline, and may be associated with the presence of exchangeable calcium in the clay minerals of the soils. * The OS-ecophenotype is characterised by a thin but large organic shell. This ecophenotype is primarily found at high altitudes in the mesic and xeric fell- fields, in soils with large particles that lack clay and exchangeable calcium. Snails of the OS-ecophenotype are characterised by thinner and larger shell sizes compared to snails of the MS-ecophenotype, indicating a trade-off between mineral thickness and shell size. The OS-ecophenotype has a highly flexible shell. Notodiscus hookeri has unique shell micro-scale structure among gastropods: * A dense and homogeneous organic layer is loosely attached to the upper periostracum and the inner mineral layer. * In the organic layer of the shell, there is prevalence of glycine-rich proteins (glycine, leucine, isoleucine, valine), and an absence of chitin. Almost all other gastropods with reduced shells have chitin. The only other known example of the absence of chitin is the internal shell of the slug Ariolimax columbianus.Meenakshi V. R. & Scheer B. T. (1970). \\"Chemical studies of the internal shell of the slug, Ariolimax columbianus (Gould) with special reference to the organic matrix\\". Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology 34(4): 953-957. . Ecology This land snail is a gregarious species that lives under moist stones, moss and wet vegetation; however, it is also widespread in fell-field areas, which are characterised by very low vegetation cover. This snail live in relatively simple ecosystems, that is caused by harsh environmental conditions on subantarctic islands. It is a litter-dwelling species. The soil is known to be a nutrient resource for Notodiscus hookeri, since this species has been found to significantly increase calcium release in solutions derived from plant litter. Digestive system of Notodiscus hookeri Notodiscus hookeri exclusively feeds on lichens such as Orceolina kerguelensis, Usnea taylorii and Pseudocyphellaria crocata.Gadea, A., Le Pogam, P., Biver, G., Boustie, J., Le Lamer, A. C., Le D√©v√©hat, F., & Charrier, M. (2017). \\"Which Specialized Metabolites Does the Native Subantarctic Gastropod Notodiscus hookeri Extract from the Consumption of the Lichens Usnea taylorii and Pseudocyphellaria crocata?\\". Molecules 22(3): 425. Notodiscus hookeri appears as a generalist lichen feeder able to consume toxic metabolite-containing lichens. Hatchlings have a shell width of < 2.0 mm. Juveniles have a shell width of about 2.0-4.0 mm. Adults have a shell width larger than 4.0 mm. The biology of this species is poorly known.

She created a company to build her own design of a two-wheeled wheelchair based on a Segway. Skiing career Ruth was born in Hedemora Municipality in 1973. She had both her legs amputated at the age of three due to an accident with a lorry. At the age of 12, she decided that she wanted to ski and contacted Ecke Lindgren, who constructed a sit-ski for her. She achieved a major success at the 1990 World Championships where she took all five gold medals at Winter Park in Colorado. After this win, a charity was set up in her name to support athletes from her municipality. At the 1992 Winter Paralympics she took a gold medal at Albertville in the Giant Slalom; her time of 2:36:78 beat Shannon Bloedel and Candace Cable of the USA. Ruth then hurt her back and did no further events. She subsequently retired from competitive skiing. Wheelchair development Ruth, who took the name of Marit Sundin, lived in √Öre and had to rely on her car for transport, particularly for skiing as there was no good snow locally. Sundin experimented with Segways. She ordered a type of Segway that allowed the rider to sit. However this design depended on the transfer of weight to slow down and Sundin could not achieve this, so the device was difficult to stop. She devised a new, Segway-based chair in which the chair is mounted on rails. This new design allows the rider to rapidly transfer their weight and therefore control the vehicle. Sundin started a company in 2011 to market her idea for the Segway-based vehicle. The new company is called AddMovement and she is the CEO.

Rippon Tor Rifle Range is a disused rifle range within Dartmoor National Park, Devon, England. The range is situated southeast of the 473 m high Rippon Tor, near the village Widecombe- in-the-Moor, and close to the road between Halshanger and Cold East Cross. History The marker's gallery, with the remaining target mechanism. At the far end is the store/workshop building. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, most of the Moor saw renewed activity, as it was commandeered for the use of military training. Various training was undertaken, including artillery firing. A large area of 4,451 hectares to the south and south east of Hexworthy was taken over for rifle, machine gun and anti-tank firing. A new rifle range was built near Rippon Tor to train soldiers, an airfield was constructed on Roborough Down, and a new hutted camp was built at Plasterdown. The latter was later used as a hospital by the American Forces. The newtake below Rippon Tor was chosen as the site for the firing range, and it was successfully built in 1941. Following the end of the war, training cadets became the main users of the range. Whenever training took place, red warning flags were hoisted on poles at Cold East Cross, Hemsworthy Gate, Rippon Tor and elsewhere around the site. 800 square metres of the surrounding moor would be closed to public access. Bob Butler and Phill Germon, from Ashburton, were the original range wardens. Although most main firing ranges in Dartmoor were closed by the late 1940s/early 1950s, Rippon Tor Rifle Range continued to be active until the mid-1960s. The range closed in 1977 on the expiry of its lease,http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV55113&resourceID;=104 although the closure was also pushed by the Dartmoor National Park Committee, who objected to its use due to dangers to the public walking on the moors. Afterwards further opposition continued from some who wanted the butt destroyed, however the landowner had decided that it should remain as a piece of wartime archaeology. Design One side of the stop butt. The majority of the site remains in good condition. The main part of the site features the monumental brick stop butt, estimated to be 55 metres long by 15.5 metres wide and around 9.2 metres high. This structure is supported by nineteen buttresses on the north side and six buttresses on both the east and west sides. The back stop is infilled with earth, gravel and sand to form a sloping bank facing South. This was the receiving end, where shots were fired into the bank. On the opposite side of the butt is the markers' gallery, which still holds the rusting machinery that once operated the raising and lowering of the targets, as well as remains of seat supports. The gallery consists of twelve target frames, (using the Hythe pattern), and associated winding mechanisms, housed in a concrete, earth-covered bunker. This section was built of cantilevered concrete sections on a brick wall, and allowed the range operators to raise and lower targets, patch shot holes and signal adjustments to firing points, where necessary. A now-roofless building is located at the eastern side of the gallery which once served as the target store and workshop. The soldiers would fire at the stop butt from four large earth mounds spaced out across the hillside to the east. These mounds are approximately 91.5 metres apart. These mounds remain, as do some dug-in concreted pits on the top of these banks. Inside the entrance gate of the site, to the south-west of the main site, there are two other ancillary buildings. A troop shelter remains with wooden benches where soldiers sat to wait their turn for practice. This consists of a long building comprising twenty-four bays and is constructed of concrete block with an asbestos roof. Each bay of the building is defined by a reinforced concrete framework over which lie wooden battens that support the roof, whilst the rear wall has a number of buttresses. Brick plinths remain, and these are likely to have supported benches. The shelter has been incorrectly identified as stables. A now-roofless, small room at one end of the structure remains, with a tree growing inside it. Near to this building are the remains of a toilet block with seven cubicles. A possible vehicle park is located close by, adjacent to the highway and to the track that leads to the butts. A possible pumping station for the range, next to the road between Cold East Cross and Halshanger Cross, was noted in a survey of the site in 2010. The remains of a water storage structure, located close to the butts, measuring 5.7 by 3.8 metres, encloses four galvanised storage tanks.

It portrayed the state as being resilient and having recovered from the impact and aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, which had caused severe damage in Autumn 2012. The media blitz included billboards, radio spots, and television commercials featuring the Jersey Shore and including appearances by the Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, and his wife and children. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided funding for the promotional campaign. The awarding of the contract to marketing firm MWW and the propriety of Christie's use of the ads during a re- election campaign has drawn media and governmental scrutiny. In January 2014, HUD initiated an audit of the expenditure. The audit is one of two simultaneous federal inquiries begun in 2014 involving the Chris Christie administration use of federal funds provided by the Hurricane Sandy relief bill. Sandy funding and bids Hurricane Sandy, which had landfall on October 29, 2012, caused a 13-foot tidal surge that inundated many coastal communities on the Jersey Shore, the Hudson Waterfront, and the New Jersey Meadowlands. As part of recovery funding, New Jersey received a waiver from HUD to use $25 million for advertising to promote tourism in the state the following season. The campaign was administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, directed by Michelle A. Brown, which was responsible for the distribution of Sandy relief funds. Of four bidders, two were invited to do presentations to the board on March 15, 2013. The contract was awarded to the marketing firm MWW, based in East Rutherford. Production and release of TV ads MWW's plan included six TV and radio spots, billboards (at Times Square and the Lincoln Tunnel, among other locations) a social media blitz, and an advertising jingle. The campaign targeted markets in New Jersey, New York City, New York State, Philadelphia and other parts of Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Washington, and eastern Canada. MWW engaged a sub-contractor, Brushfire, Inc. to produce the TV commercials. Brushfire wrote the lyrics for the Stronger than the Storm theme song. Songwriter Brian Jones of Bang composed the music. The jingle for the 30-second television commercial was later turned into a full-length single. The official roll-out of the \\"Stronger than the Storm\\" campaign coincided with the May 24, 2013 broadcast of the \\"Today Show\\" live from Seaside Heights, with Christie as co-host. During the show, NBC cameras cut to Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and local officials cutting a blue ribbon stretched along the shoreline. The ads ran until September 1. Criticism of contract and Christie appearance In April 2013, a bill was introduced into the New Jersey Assembly that would \\"prohibit the Governor or the Lieutenant Governor from appearing in certain announcements and federal or State-funded advertisements during gubernatorial election year.\\" In May 2013, before the release of the commercials, Democrats in Assembly again questioned the use of the funds and the propriety of featuring the Christie family. On August 4, 2013 the Asbury Park Press published an article that identified fees to be paid for employee compensation for MWW at $4.7 million, $2.2 million more than the other bidder. It also noted that the panel that made the decision to hire MWW was led by Brown, who had once borrowed $46,000 from Christie. On August 6, the paper reported that the firm had recently hired the former executive director of the Burlington County Republican Committee, Rich Levesque, who was noted as having \\"strong relationships over the years with many of Governor Christie's closest advisors as well as many of his cabinet appointees\\". On August 8, Frank Pallone, the U.S. Representative for , wrote a letter to HUD requesting an inquiry into the potential misuse of disaster aid for political gain. Pallone said he thought Christie's Sandy ad campaign \\"smelled\\" and called for investigation to dispel any appearance of impropriety, drawing attention to the $2.2 million difference between the accepted bid and the next most expensive bid, which included no plans to include the governor in the ads. Barbara Buono, State Senator from the 18th Legislative District and Christie's opponent in the 2013 gubernatorial election, called the ads an abuse of the funds. In a hearing on Sandy relief funds before the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky) said, \\"In New Jersey, $25 million was spent on ads that included somebody running for political office\\", and asked, \\"Do ya' think there might be a conflict of interest of there?\\" In March 2014, The New Republic reported that documents requested in regard to the contract award decision were redacted to conceal committee members. Also in March 2014, Christie claimed that the uptick in tourism in 2013 was evidence that the campaign was successful. It was also announced the MWW would produce the 2014 season ads, without a new bidding process, and that Christie would not appear in the campaign called Going Strong. HUD audit On January 14, 2014, HUD announced that it would review the expenditure. A press release stated that it is \\"an audit and not an investigation of the procurement process\\".. The audit is based on irregularities with billing and adherence to the contract pricing, as determined by the federal government. MWW, in a press release, stated that it welcomed the review and that it had not presented the idea of Christie appearing in ads until after the contract was awarded. It said it was confident that it had followed correct billing procedures. The federal audit released on September 3, 2014,http://www.hudoig.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2014-PH-1008.pdf did not find fault with the appearance of the governor and his family in the ad, but instead found fault with the mechanics of awarding the contract, specifically that key procurement requirements had not been met. Hoboken Sandy relief fund investigation Several days after the HUD announcement, on January 18, 2014, Mayor of Hoboken Dawn Zimmer, appearing on MSNBC, claimed that Lt Governor Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, director of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, had earlier insinuated to her that more Sandy relief funds would be released to the city if it approved a project in its northwest quadrant. On February 22, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed members of the city's government and potential witnesses, who were instructed to preserve any evidence they might possess. They were also asked by the office of United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Paul Fishman, to not discuss the matter publicly. On January 31, the city acknowledged that it had received subpoenas from that office.

It aired on Fox in the United States on April 1, 2014. Effective with this episode, the action of the show is to be centered in New York City, and continue there for the remainder of the season. Plot Life in New York City has its own challenges for the newly transplanted McKinley graduates and already established glee club members, now that some months have passed. Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) is a leading lady on Broadway with all that entails, Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) is now rooming with both fianc√© Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), and film school student Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) has trouble getting places in his wheelchair. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) is another arrival in the city; she is looking to record a new album. Production With this episode, the show shifts to New York City, where the action will be centered for the remainder of the fifth season, and resumes chronologically after \\"a few months\\" have passed since the two-part episode that featured the end of the school year and the glee club's demise. This episode features the smallest number of main cast members present: Michele (Rachel), Colfer (Kurt), McHale (Artie), Criss (Blaine) and Overstreet (Sam). The rest of the season 5 main cast are credited but do not appear. Recurring characters appearing in this episode include aspiring singer Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), NYU student and Kurt's band member Elliott \\"Starchild\\" Gilbert (Adam Lambert), and Funny Girl producer Sidney Greene (Michael Lerner). Six songs from the episode are being released on a six-track EP with the same title as the episode. These include: Petula Clark's \\"Downtown\\", sung by Michele, Colfer, Criss, McHale and Overstreet; Frank Sinatra's \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\", sung by Criss and Colfer; \\"Best Day of My Life\\" by the American Authors, sung by Criss and Overstreet; Petula Clark's \\"Don't Sleep in the Subway\\", sung by Michele and McHale; \\"People\\" from Funny Girl, sung by Michele; and \\"Rockstar\\" by A Great Big World, sung by Lambert and Colfer. Reception=Ratings The episode was watched by 2.59 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 0.9/3, matching series low ratings with \\"Puppet Master\\" and \\"City of Angels.\\" The show placed fourth in its timeslot and thirteenth for the night. Critical reception The episode received critical acclaim from critics. Rae Votta of Billboard called the episode \\"hands-down the best episode of ‚ÄúGlee‚Äù to date. There's barely any contest. Season 1 purists will hold up the Pilot as an ideal episode, and you admittedly couldn't get to here without those inventive and inspiring beginnings, but that's just building blocks and not substance. After 4 and a half years ‚ÄúGlee‚Äù has evolved from a plucky magical reality about high school underdogs to a group of friends living out their ambitions in New York City, and it finally feels right. Kurt and Rachel's New York of the last year-and-a- half felt like a fable, but bring some more of McKinley there and it settles into the reality that ‚ÄúGlee‚Äôs‚Äù always promised.\\" Suzanne Davis of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3 stars out of 5. Jodi Walker of Entertainment Weekly commented positively on the show's new change in direction, saying \\"It really felt like watching a different show tonight. Or maybe more like watching the old show? Before everything got so convoluted; before we watched characters we didn‚Äôt really know share airtime with characters we were maybe too familiar with; before things just straight up went off the rails. It didn‚Äôt exactly feel like season 1 or 2 of Glee; more like a cousin to that classic version of Glee. A cool New York cousin who plays with lighting and films outside of a sound stage and only listens to old vinyl records of the classics. She also occasionally has one too many glasses of wine and can‚Äôt stop speaking in voiceover.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com also commented positively on the show's move in New York, saying that \\"The result is a show that suddenly feels exciting, fresh, and BIG.\\" She also praised the musical performances, saying that they felt sophisticated and glamorous and fun with their extended dance sequences, toned-down color schemes, and sweeping scenery.

They are made with a batter of wheat flour, chickpea flour, water, onion (alternatively shallot or scallion), parsley, shrimp, salt and pepper. The batter is then fried on both sides in a pan with plenty of olive oil. Usually it is served with small side dishes. In Andalusia the shrimp species Palaemon longirostris is typically used, for which camar√≥n is the local name. Because the shrimp are so small it is too difficult to shell them, so they are cooked whole. This specific species of shrimp is hard to come by outside of Andalusia. A different species of shelled shrimp can serve as a substitute, but without Palaemon longirostris the taste of the dish will be different. The dish originates from either C√°diz or San Fernando, or possibly both. The dish became well known in the nineteenth century, but may have been created as early as the start of the sixteenth century. The Genoese colony present in C√°diz probably contributed to its invention, which might have resulted from the combination of Genoese farinata and Spanish gachuela.

She stayed a while in Haiti before moving to Cuman√° where she learned that her husband had been executed on the orders of the Spanish General Monteverde. She then married the English Colonel, Charles Chamberlain, who was attached to the Staff of General Bolivar. Chamberlain had been severely wounded in the battle of Unare Barracks, and took refuge with Eulalia in Venezuela in Barcelona, Anzo√°tegui. On 7 April 1817 the Royalist Army took Barcelona. The town's entire population took refuge in the Convent of San Francisco. After Chamberlain died in combat, Ramos attempted to move his body before being captured and beaten by a Spanish officer. He proposed that she gives up the independence cause in exchange for remaining alive, but she quickly took his gun and shot him in the chest, killing him instantly, while shouting \\"Viva la Patria -- mueran los tiranos\\". Immediately, the other Spaniards pounce on her, killing her with their bayonets, while the army fell into the hands of the royalist forces.

In order to upload their real estate to MRIS database, subscribers have to click \\"yes\\" to MRIS Terms of Use Agreement (\\"TOU\\") that assigns copyright in each photographs to MRIS. MRIS registers the database every quarter with the U.S. Copyright Office pursuant to the rules for an automated database. As the basis for each quarterly application, MRIS typically describes the material as \\"daily updated and revised text and images and new text and images,\\" but does not name or describe individual photos. American Home Realty Network (\\"AHRN\\") operates NeighborCity.com, a national real estate search engine and referral business. The site gets its information, among others, by scraping information from the MRIS Database. After failure to make a licensing agreement, MRIS field suit against AHRN and its CEO for copyright infringement and sought for a preliminary injunction. The district court granted a preliminary injunction in the use of MRIS's photographs. AHRN appealed based on two reasons: # MRIS failed to register its copyright in the individual photographs; # By clicking \\"yes\\" to TOU, subscribers did not transfer their copyright in the photographs to MRIS.  Opinion of Court =On the copyright registration of a collective work For the first issue, AHRN asserted that MRIS failed to identify names of creators and titles of individual works as required by Therefore, MRIS did not register its interest in the individual photographs. The court stated that allows a groups registration of related works, such as automated database. As articulated in Craigslist v. 3Taps, the court recognized collective work registration as sufficient if the registrant owns the rights to the component work, because \\"it would be ... [absurd and] inefficient to require the registrant to list each author for an extremely large number of component works to which the registrant has acquired an exclusive license.\\" In addition, it would add impediments to automated database authors' attempts to register their own component works and would conflict with the general purpose of Section 409, which is encouraging prompt registration. Thus thwarting the specific goal embodied in Section 408 of easing the burden on group registrations. Here, MRIS owned each photographs transferred by the subscriber. Therefore, MRIS satisfied the pre-suit registration requirement. On the Clickwrap agreement The court moved to the other issue, whether clicking \\"yes\\" to MRIS's TOU operated as an assignment of copyright in the photographs under . > A transfer of one or more of the exclusive rights of copyright ownership by > assignment or exclusive license is not valid unless an instrument of > conveyance, or a note or memorandum of the transfer, is in writing and > signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner's duly authorized > agent The court noted that was intended to solve a dispute between owners and transferees, not for the benefit of a third party infringer. E-SIGN Act defines an electronic signature means that: \\"...an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.\\" A click on the website could be regarded as signature under the E-SIGN Act. Citing E-SIGN Act, the court stated that this Act can be applied to a copyright case because none of the exception under this Act applies to this case. provides that it \\"does not ... limit, alter, or otherwise affect any requirement imposed by a statute, regulation, or rule of law ... other than a requirement that contracts or other records be written, signed, or in nonelectric form.\\" Since requires transfers be \\"written\\" and \\"signed,\\" intended to limit, alter, or otherwise affect of . Therefore, the court held that the electronic agreement can satisfied a transfer of right under . Affirmed the District Court's decision.  Subsequent developments  From the decision in this case, by clicking \\"yes\\" to the Clickwrap Agreement, a user could agree to transfer his copyright to the websites, other than his intent to agree with the term of use. This could establish some new considerations for practitioners dealing with copyright matters. As more transactions become entirely electronic in nature, it is likely that more courts will join the Fourth Circuit in holding that clicks and taps can constitute signed writings in general business as well as specifically in the copyright context. The court concluded that subscribers who click \\"yes\\" to the Terms of Use Agreement indicate assent via E-sign.However, the court gave no comment on whether such assent would constitute a valid agreement in this appeal to preliminary injunction; therefore, the validity MRIS's copyright transfer might need to further be solved in its merit claims. Whether the accepting in a Clickwrap Agreement should be interpreted that the user consented to transfer his own right is still a controversial issue. In a practical way, it might have to consider if the user is forced to click yes to the Clickwrap Agreement. If so, it might be clearer if the website would use both the clicking to the Term of Use and the signing to assent to transfer the user's right to the website. It should be interesting to see how other courts would decide this same issue.

In a racing career which was seriously disrupted by injuries and other health problems, he won five times from seventeen starts between December 2002 and March 2010. After showing promising, but unremarkable form in his early career he showed great improvement when switched to steeplechasing in the autumn of 2004. In March 2005 at Cheltenham Racecourse he won the Grade I Royal & SunAlliance Chase, one of the season's most prestigious races for Novice chasers. On his next appearance in November 2005, he won the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup under the biggest weights carried to victory in the race for twenty years. At the time, he was regarded as one of the best steeplechasers in training, but he never won again: he missed the next three years with injury and failed to recover his form when returning to the track. Background Trabolgan is a dark-coated bay gelding bred in Ireland by Michael Lysaght. He was sired by King's Ride who won the Lincoln Handicap in 1980 before becoming a successful National Hunt stallion. His other progeny included Mister Morose (Aintree Hurdle), King's Curate (Stayers' Hurdle) and Kings Road (Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup). His dam, Derrella, was an unraced mare who also produced Huka Lodge, the winner of seven National Hunt races between 2004 and 2009. In November 1999, the yearling was sent to the Tattersalls Ireland sale and was bought for 49,000 guineas by the British Bloodstock Agency. He entered the ownership of Trevor Hemmings and was sent into training with Nicky Henderson in Upper Lambourne in Berkshire. Racing career=2002/2003 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races Trabolgan began his racing career in National Hunt Flat races, also known as \\"bumpers\\" starting with an event at Uttoxeter Racecourse on 21 December, in which he was made 7/4 favourite and finished second, four lengths behind the winner, Plastic Paddy. After a break of two months, he returned in a similar event at Kempton Park Racecourse and started the 2/1 favourite against eighteen opponents. Ridden for the first time by Mick Fitzgerald he took the lead three furlongs from the finish but was caught in the closing stages and beaten a neck by Chelsea Bridge. Despite failing to win, the gelding was moved up sharply in class for the Grade I Champion Bumper on 12 March at the Cheltenham Festival. He started a 50/1 outsider and was ridden by Seamus Durack, with Fitzgerald partnering the Henderson stable's more fancied runner Back to Ben Alder. Trabolgan produced by far his best performance up to that time, moving up to challenge for the lead in the straight and finishing second by half a length to the Martin Pipe-trained favourite Liberman. 2003/2004 National Hunt season: Novice Hurdles In the 2003/2004 season, Trabolgan competed in Novice hurdle races, beginning at Aintree Racecourse in November where he started 11/8 favourite but fell at the sixth flight. The gelding recorded his first win at his fifth attempt when he won a minor novice's hurdle over two and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse on 19 December, winning \\"comfortably\\" by seven lengths at odds of 1/2. At Newbury Racecourse in January, Trabolgan started 2/5 favourite for a similar event and won easily by eight lengths from Noplanofaction. After the race, Henderson described the winner as \\"a lovely horse, a gorgeous horse and is still only a baby\\" before indicating that he would aim him at the Royal & SunAlliance Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. Trabolgan started favourite for a Novice's Hurdle at Market Rasen in February but was pulled up by Fitzgerald after only three hurdles and did not race again that season. 2004/2005 National Hunt season: Novice Chases Trabolgan began to compete in steeplechases in the following season, starting in a novices' event at Lingfield Park on 24 November. Fitzgerald moved the gelding up to dispute the lead three fences from the finish and Trabolgan drew clear of his opponents in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths from Kadount. Trabolgan was then moved up in class and distance for the Grade I Feltham Novices' Chase over three miles at Kempton on Boxing Day. Over the last two fences, the nine-runner race developed into a struggle between Trabolgan and the 13/8 favourite Ollie Magern. Trabolgan overtook the favourite 150 yards from the finish, but Ollie Magern rallied to regain the lead in the final strides and won by a short head. Four weeks later, the gelding started favourite for a novices' chase at Haydock Park, but was no match for the French-bred Jazz d'Estruval, who won easily by nine lengths. On 16 March, Trabolgan was ridden by Fitzgerald in the Grade I Royal & SunAlliance Chase over three miles at the Cheltenham Festival and started the 5/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Comply or Die, L'Ami (winner of the December Novices' Chase) and Cornish Rebel (younger brother of Best Mate). The other runners included the outstanding Irish mare Like-A- Butterfly. Trabolgan tracked Comply or Die for most of the race and recovered from a bad mistake at the second last fence to take the lead approaching the last. In the closing stages Trabolgan drew clear to win by three lengths from Comply or Die with Cornish Rebel a further three lengths back in third. 2005/2006 National Hunt season: Steeplechases Trabolgan began his 2005/2006 campaign on 26 November in the Hennessy Gold Cup, a handicap race over three and a quarter miles at Newbury, in which he was matched against more experienced chasers. He was assigned top weight of 166 pounds (11 stone 12 pounds) and started at odds of 13/2 in a field of nineteen runners. Mick Fitzgerald, who was returning from a long absence after suffering a serious neck injury, positioned the gelding just behind the leaders and maintained his position despite two bad jumping mistakes before moving up to challenge for the lead four fences from the finish. Trabolgan took the lead at the second last fence, held off the challenge of L'Ami, and pulled clear in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths. The horse had carried the highest weight to victory since Burrough Hill Lad more than twenty years previously: the only other horses to have carried a higher weight had been Arkle and Mill House in the 1960s. Henderson, who was winning the race for the first time said: \\"It's taken me 25 years to do it. Mick struggled to get back and to do that is special for everybody\\". Following his victory at Newbury, Trabolgan was regarded as a leading contender for the 2006 Cheltenham Gold Cup and was expected to reappear in the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day. Shortly after his win, however, the gelding became lame and scans revealed a tendon injury. It was hoped that he would return in time for the Gold Cup but the injury proved more serious and he was ruled out for the rest of the season. At the time, Henderson described the decision to rest the horse as \\"precautionary more than anything and luckily he is a young horse with half his career still ahead of him\\". Later career Repeated injury problem meant that Trabolgan did not race again for more than three years. He returned as a ten-year-old, with Henderson expressing cautious optimism, but suffered from breathing problems and was unable to recover his old form. In December 2008 when he was pulled up two fences from the finish when tailed off in a handicap at Ascot. In his only other race that season he finished last of the six runners in the Levy Board Chase at Kempton in February. Trabolgan ran three times without success in the 2009/2010 National Hunt season. He finished fourth in a handicap chase at Cheltenham in December when he jumped poorly and then unseated his rider, Barry Geraghty in a veterans' chase (restricted to horses of at least ten years of age) at Doncaster Racecourse in February. On 4 March he started favourite for a veterans' handicap at Newbury, but made several jumping errors and finished a distant fourth behind Eric's Charm. On 23 March it was announced that Trabolgan would not race again and would be retired to Hemmings' property on the Isle of Man. Hemmings' racing manager said \\"We thought the sky was the limit after the Hennessy, but it was not to be. He's a beautiful horse and it was the obvious decision\\".

Al-Muhallabi later served as the administrator of Ahvaz, and soon began serving the Buyids who were the new masters of Iraq and western Iran. Al-Muhallabi quickly rose as a prominent figure at the Buyid court, and later became the companion of Abu Ja'far Saymari, the chief secretary of Mu'izz al-Dawla, who was the Buyid ruler of Iraq. In 950/951, Mu'izz al-Dawla appointed as Muhallabi his vizier and gave him the title of ostadh. In 950/951, Mu'izz al-Dawla, after constant conflict against the Batihah ruler 'Imran ibn Shahin, sent an army under the joint command of al-Muhallabi and the Daylamite general Ruzbahan. Ruzbahan, who disliked al-Muhallabi, convinced him to directly attack 'Imran. He kept his forces in the rear and fled as soon as fighting between the two sides began. 'Imran used the terrain effectively, laying ambushes and confusing al- Muhallabi's army. Many of the al-Muhallabi's soldiers died in the fighting and he himself only narrowly escaped capture, swimming to safety. Mu'izz al-Daula then came to terms with 'Imran, acceding to his terms. Prisoners were exchanged and 'Imran was made a vassal of the Buyids, being instated as governor of the Batihah. Al-Muhallabi died in 963 after having received a sickness during his campaign in Oman. According to Ibn Miskawayh, however, al- Muhallabi was poisoned by Mu'izz al-Dawla.

Biography Theodor Horschelt was the son of ballet master, Friedrich Horschelt. His older brother, Friedrich, was a portrait painter. Beginning in 1846, he went to the Academy of Fine Arts Munich where he was a student of the history painter, Joseph Anton Rhomberg, but left him after a short period and attempted to learn drawing on his own. He initially focused on scenes from nature and imaginative portrayals of the Caucasian Wars. He soon took direction from Professor Hermann Ansch√ºtz, learning precision and clarity of outline. After leaving the Academy, he studied with more enthusiasm in the studios of Albrecht and Franz Adam and Julius Lange. He eventually decided to devote himself exclusively to war paintings, and began by doing sketches of horses at the Royal Stables in Stuttgart. In 1853, he made two study trips; one to Paris with Friedrich Wilhelm Hackl√§nder and one to Spain with him and Christian Friedrich von Leins, where he mostly wandered about on horseback. He separated from his companions when they crossed to North Africa and rode on alone to Algiers. On his return to Munich in 1854, he painted several canvases on Arabian themes for King William. These works made it possible for him to take his long-planned trip to the Caucasus. The Caucasus Soon after his arrival there in 1858, he joined an expedition against the Lezghians. The following year, he was part of a military campaign in Chechnya and participated in an attack on the headquarters of Imam Shamil, exposing himself to enemy fire. For his bravery, he was honored with the Grand Cross Star of the Order of Saint Stanislaus and a medal of the Order of St. Anna, both with swords. For two weeks in 1860, he toured with Tsar Alexander II on a journey through the Kuban, then joined Prince Albert of Prussia on a tour to Armenia and the shores of the Caspian, returning to Munich by way of Moscow and St.Petersburg in 1863. Once home, he began to produce the war paintings that would establish his reputation. A projected return to the Caucasus was thwarted by the start of the Franco-Prussian War and Horschelt died of diphtheria nine months later.

British career Wallace represented England and won a silver medal in the individual pursuit and a bronze medal in the team pursuit, at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Twelve years later he won another silver medal in the individual pursuit at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia in Canada and followed this up four years later by winning a further silver medal in the scratch race, at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. US career After successes in his native Great Britain in track cycling, including winning British Championships over distances of 1 km, 4 km and 20 km, Wallace moved to the USA where he continued his career as an amateur, and from 1986 onward as a Professional Cyclist for a variety of teams and sponsors: * 1987: Alfa-Romeo * 1988: Sunkyonk SKC * 1989 Wheaties-Schwinn * 1990: Schwinn/Pure-Power/Bowflex * 1991: Scott-BiKyle Cycles In 2003 Wallace was one of the inaugural inductees into the Hall of Fame at the Lehigh Valley Velodrome in Pennsylvania, where he had based from during most of his cycling career. A tribute night had been held in his honor there in 1997. As a masters cyclists, Wallace returned to the UK in 2002 to compete for the first time at the World Masters Track Cycling Championships where he won both the 40-44 age group Pursuit, and the Points race events. More recently (2017 and previous years), Wallace has coached at the San Diego Velodrome. Altitude Training and Simulation Throughout his cycling career Wallace made significant use of altitude training to optimize his performance, first with trips to Colorado Springs, and later went on to be a pioneer in the application of the \\"Live High - Train Low\\" method by renting a cabin to sleep at Woodland Park CO (8465'), driving down to train on the Colorado Springs Velodrome (6035'), then driving up Pikes Peak (14,114') for an afternoon rest, and training in the evening whist breathing oxygen-enhanced air to simulate sea level (0'). In 1995 Wallace used a personal hypobaric chamber to prepare for the World Championships held in Bogota (8661') Colombia, and in 1996 took the chamber with him into the Olympic Athletes Village in Atlanta where he represented Great Britain. The following year Wallace developed and built the world's first Altitude tent which simulated altitude by changing the composition of the gas mixture inside the tent rather than reduce the pressure. The Wallace Altitude Tent went on to become the world's first commercially available product of this type. Wallace has continued to work in the simulated-altitude industry, developing systems for a variety of applications including pilot training at 30,000', controlled exercise and sleeping systems for athletes, and controlled oxygen-enrichment systems to provide relief from altitude-related problems for residents living in mountain locations.

Now part of the British Museum's ancient Middle Eastern collection, they form an important corpus of information on religious and military practices in South Arabia between the 1st Century BC and 3rd Century AD. Discovery The Amran Tablets seem to have been discovered in the mid nineteenth century during the construction of a house at the town of  øAmrƒÅn, which lies just to the north of the city of Sana'a in Yemen. 28 different panels were unearthed at the time (although more may have been melted down and destroyed) which were subsequently presented to the British Museum in 1862 by Brigadier-Colonel William Coghlan and Captain Robert Playfair of the Royal Artillery regiment. Coghlan had been appointed Political Resident and Commandment in Aden in 1854, 15 years after the Colony of Aden had become part of the British Empire. Description All the plaques were cast in bronze through the lost-wax casting process and inscribed in the Sabaean script. They probably would have been attached to the walls of a temple as votive offerings to the gods. In the panel illustrated on this page, the inscription identifies the god Almaqah, who was the principle deity in the kingdom of Saba. The tablet records that it was dedicated in the name of Riyan and his brothers, the grandsons of Marthad from the tribe of Dhu Amran. The top of the plaque shows a pair of sphinxes flanking a lotus blossom and framed by two date palms. At the bottom of the plaque are floral patterns including two rosettes. Other plaques in the series highlight the uneasy relationship between the rival kingdoms of Saba and the Arabs of the Jawf. The text of the panels refer to a number of military conflicts and battles that raged between them, which were often about controlling the trade of frankincense and myrrh, two aromatic products exclusive to the region of South Arabia that generated considerable wealth for the local population.

Description Torwoodlee Broch () is situated on the site of an earlier hillfort on the shoulder of a ridge. The hillfort is an irregular oval in shape, measuring about 137 metres by 136 metres. The broch itself lies on the southwest side of the fort and partly on top of the defences. The diameter of the broch is 23.2 metres and the outer wall is 5.2 metres thick. The central court has a diameter of about 12 metres. The broch lies about two miles south of Bow Castle Broch. Excavations The broch was first cleared out by James Curle in 1891 at which time much Roman pottery and glass, together with a 1st-century AD coin were found inside it. It was systematically excavated in 1950 by Stuart Piggott. More Roman pottery and glass was found beneath the wall of the broch. The broch appears to have been built soon after the Romans withdrew from Scotland in about 100 AD, and was thrown down again shortly afterwards, perhaps by a Roman expedition preparing for the reoccupation of 140 AD. The many fragments of Roman material found in the broch might be explained as loot from the nearby legionary fort at Newstead (Trimontium).

From Luzhong (ÈôÜÁªà), a great-great-grandson of the legendary emperor Zhuanxu. Luzhong's father Wuhui (Âê¥Âõû) was put in charge of fire by Emperor Ku and given the title of Zhu Rong. Luzhong's clan migrated to Pinglu County, Shanxi, and later moved to Pinglu of Shandong, in present-day Wenshang County. 2\\\\. From Luhun (ÈôÜÊµë), a tribe of the Rong nomads who established a state in modern Song County, Henan. In 525 BC, Luhun was annexed by the State of Jin, a major power during the Spring and Autumn period. Many of the Luhun people adopted Lu as their surname. 3\\\\. From the Tian (Chen) lineage of the Gui clan (Â¶´), the ruling family of the State of Chen during the Spring and Autumn period. Chen Wan (later called Tian Wan), a prince of Chen, escaped to the State of Qi after losing a power struggle in his home state. Tian Wan's descendants prospered in Qi and eventually usurped the throne of the kingdom, which became known as Tian Qi. During the Warring States period, King Xuan of Qi enfeoffed his youngest son Tian Tong at Lu ÈôÜ (in modern Laoling, Shandong), which was named after a branch of the Luzhong clan. Tian Tong's descendants adopted Lu as their surname. Later adoption During the Xianbei Northern Wei dynasty, Emperor Xiaowen (reigned 467‚Äì499 AD) implemented a drastic policy of sinicization, ordering his own people to adopt Chinese surnames. The Bulugu (Ê≠•ÈôÜÂ≠§) tribe of Xianbei adopted Lu as their surname. The Xianbei people have since completely assimilated into the Han Chinese. The Xianbei Lu later became highly prosperous. Out of the four most prominent Lu ÈôÜ clans in history, which were based in the commanderies of Henan, Henei, Pingyuan, and Wu, two (Henan and Henei) traced their ancestry to the Bulugu tribe.

He demanded that Manrique supply him with ammunition, and warned that he would burn Pensacola to the ground if the governor did not cooperate. Manrique informed his superiors of the intention of McQueen and the Red Sticks to launch a war against the Americans. Manrique considered the Red Sticks to be an important ally against the American forces, although initially he had sent Spanish troops against them. Jackson, believing that the British were conspiring with the Spanish and the Creeks against American interests, demanded that Manrique expel them from Florida. He then led an American army to seize the city, and arrived there on November 6, 1814. During the battle, the Spanish garrison offered little resistance to Jackson's assault. The British consequently abandoned Fort Barrancas and left Florida, fleeing with several hundred Indians in a British ship. Jackson considered that he had extinguished the conspiracy and returned Pensacola to Manrique. Destruction of Fort Barrancas in Pensacola by the British and their escape According to historian Eric Beerman, in December 1814 prior to the Battle of New Orleans, Nicolls moved once again into Pensacola where he took Spanish soldiers and slaves as prisoners of war to use against the Americans in New Orleans campaign. Andrew Jackson, however, returned to Pensacola with his forces, forcing the British to retreat and Nicolls to keep the prisoners in the British headquarters at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River, 250 kilometers east of Pensacola. Manrique sent Lt. Luis Urcull√∫ with transport ships to negotiate a return of the prisoners, but was rebuffed. After the British defeat at the Battle of New Orleans in January of 1815, Manrique instructed Captain Vicente Sebastian Pintado to travel to Apalachicola and confer with British vice-admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. Cochrane agreed with Pintado, and ordered the return of all Spanish troops and slaves taken by the British to Pensacola aboard one of his ships under the command of Richard Spencer.E. Beerman.

Fundrise has been labeled as the first company to successfully crowdfund investment into the real estate market. , Fundrise had originated approximately $1.1 billion in both equity and debt investments deployed across approximately $4.9 billion of real estate property. History Fundrise was founded in 2010 by brothers Ben and Dan Miller and launched in 2012 before the passing of the JOBS Act, which enacted securities regulation to streamline the process of equity crowdfunding in the United States. Their father, Herb Miller of Western Development Corp., developed 20 million square feet of real estate based in Washington, D.C. Ben Miller worked as President of Western Development Corp. and Managing Partner of WestMill Capital Partners prior to Fundrise. Prior to Fundrise, Dan Miller worked for Western Development Corp. and also as Managing Partner of WestMill Capital Partners. The brothers founded the company with the idea to allow residents in the D.C. area to invest in real estate development projects they were building. Fundrise's first project, Maketto, in the H Street NE Corridor in Washington D.C. raised $325,000 from 175 investors, where any resident of D.C. or Virginia could invest for as little as $100, making it the first crowdfunded real estate project in the United States.  Early growth  After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital. Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States. By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors. One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years. Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million. Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million. Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises. By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings. In October 2015, co- founder and president Daniel Miller left the company. In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that \\"the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals.\\" The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting \\"serious fraudulant behavior.\\" The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.  eREIT launch  On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first \\"eREIT\\" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+. The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act. The company subsequently opened a second eREIT‚Ñ¢, the Fundrise Equity REIT‚Ñ¢, in February 2016. In December 2016, the Fundrise Income eREIT was the first company to raise $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under Regulation A. Later in December 2016, the Fundrise Growth eREIT became the second ever issuer to raise $50 million pursuant to Regulation A.  eFund launch  In June 2017, Fundrise announced the eFund, a diversified portfolio of for-sale housing in major US cities. The first eFund was the Los Angeles eFund, with an initial offering of $50 million under Regulation A+. In conjunction with the eFund launch, Fundrise introduced a goal-based investing and an advisory service.  Amazon HQ2  In 2018, Fundrise announced that it had acquired thirty residential properties in the Washington, DC area in anticipation of Amazon's HQ2 announcement. Fundrise is establishing the HQ2 DC eFund, to invest as much as $50M in residential properties throughout Washington, DC. Awards Fundrise was selected for the Forbes Fintech 50 list in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019. In 2018, Fundrise placed position 35 overall and position 1 in the financial services industry on the Inc. 5000 list.

Charlotta L√∂fgren was the daughter of the local official Anders L√∂fgr√©en (d. 1728) and Anna Schreibe and the sister of the poet Henrik Anders L√∂fgren. She married in 1738 to the vicar Petrus Lagerman (1706‚Äì1790), who occasionally wrote poems as well. She lived in Norrk√∂ping from 1746, where she was a local literary celebrity and wrote poems for festive public occasions. Charlotta L√∂fgren was published both in name and anonymously, which means that a significant amount of her poems are unidentified. She is believed to be the author \\"C.C.L\\", who published numerous poems in the period of 1742‚Äì1764. Most of her poems describe individual women, and in one poem from 1748, she makes herself the spokesperson of women and salutes Pagan Roman gods. Her correspondence, partially written in verse, with Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, Hedvig L√∂fwenski√∂ld, Hedwig Walldorff finns and her brother Henrik Anders L√∂fgren, has been preserved. Charlotta L√∂fgren has been identified with the pseudonym Climene, to whom Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht addresses a poem in the form of a letter from 1759, which is counted as a sketch to the latter famous feminist poem Fruentimrets f√∂rsvar (The Defense of Women), where Nordenflycht defense the intellectual capability of females and states that intellectual inferiority is caused by the lack of education and knowledge rather than the natural effect of gender. Nordenflycht was enthusiastic in her ambition to encourage literary talent in other females, and was reportedly happy about the female collective of writers in Norrk√∂ping, which consisted of L√∂fgren, Hedvig L√∂fwenski√∂ld, Hedwig Walldorff and Margareta Gryzell.

Early life and education Meehl, who was born in Denver, is the son of a family of wheat farmers from Hudson. It was the conversations Meehl had with his father about the future weather, and how that might affect their crops, that sparked his interest in the weather and climate. He received his B.S. (with distinction), M.S., and PhD from the University of Colorado. Scientific career He was a lead author of the sixth chapter of the IPCC Second Assessment Report, published in 1995, and helped oversee the chapter about climate projections in the IPCC AR4, published in 2007. He is an ISI highly cited researcher,Highly Cited Researchers Search Results for \\"Gerald Meehl\\" and is known for his research linking global warming to extreme weather. He has also done much research into the use of global climate models. One of these studies, in which Meehl et al. showed that models could not reproduce recent warming without including anthropogenic influences, was featured in a 2004 review of climate science by the George W. Bush administration. His research has also shown that record high temperatures in the continental United States were more than twice as common as record lows in the 2000s, that it may soon be possible to predict heat waves three weeks in advance (rather than 10 days, which is the best current forecasts can do), and that the global warming hiatus observed over the last 15 years or so may be caused by more heat accumulating in the deep ocean. When Meehl joined Matthew England to publish one such study in Nature Climate Change in 2014, Meehl said that this study \\"...makes the case that, though other factors could contribute somewhat to the early-2000s hiatus, the Pacific is a major driving force in producing naturally-occurring climate variability that can overwhelm the warming from ever-increasing greenhouse gases to produce the hiatus.\\" He also proposed that this occurred because of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation switching to its negative phase. In September 2014, Meehl et al. published another study on this topic, in which they attempted to simulate the hiatus with currently available climate models. They found that these models were able to simulate the hiatus, and concluded that it was largely caused by natural variability. Awards and honors In 1999, Meehl received the editor's award from the Journal of Climate. He also received the Jule G. Charney Award from the American Meteorological Society in 2009, and was elected a fellow of the American Geophysical Union in 2014. Other writings Meehl has also written several historical books about World War II in the Pacific. His interest in World War II began when he heard his uncles tell stories about their experiences fighting in the war when he was growing up, and he focused on the Pacific because he was sent on an expedition to Tutuila while an undergraduate at the University of Colorado.

She was known for her learning and received an education unusual for a female of her epoch, and has as such been the subject of research. Beata Rosenhane was the daughter of Beata Sparre and the diplomat Baron Schering Rosenhane. As a Swedish diplomat, her father was stationed abroad at several occasions, and it is believed that it was during his visit to Paris in France during the age of the Pr√©cieuses, when it was the fashion in France to educate females, that he decided to give his daughters equal education to that of his sons, something unique at the time at least in Sweden. The result was that his daughters are counted as the most learned and educated females in 17th-century Sweden alongside Queen Christina. This was particular the case of Beata, who apparently was the most gifted among her sisters. From the age of seven onward, she was trained in rhetoric by conversation and by writing essays in various subjects in which she was also, in parallel, educated. She also wrote poetry and acquired a literary reputation, though her poems were not published: \\"She had a rare talent, wide knowledge and great learning in the literature of foreign countries and had herself attempted poetry, though none of her writings has been printed\\".E. Meyer, Gustaf Rosenhane (1888) Her poems as well as her written study work and books have been preserved and are an object of research. Beata Rosenhane long refused to marry, though she was, after the death of her father in 1663, pressured by her family to do so. She explained that she had seen many fiances become husbands and that she did not believe them capable of any love which could give a woman happiness: that she believed that a marriage should be founded on love and that the man selected by her family was not to her taste and would not be able to pass the test and love her. Eventually, she saw herself forced to give in because of the alternative as a spinster, which would be even less independent than that of a wife. In accordance to the contemporary civil law, an unmarried woman regardless of age were placed under the guardianship under her closest male relative for life; and though a married woman was under the guardianship of her husband, she obtained legal majority as a widow. Before her marriage, she pointed out to her brother, that she gave in and agreed to marry only because as a spinster, she would not have the power to live by herself and do as she pleased, and that she would have been able to so, had she been born a male. She admitted that between the alternative of a wife and a spinster, the former was the better of two evils: \\"You do of course find it necessary to realize, that an unmarried woman would be far worse off than an unhappily married one\\".Stadin, Kekke: St√•nd och genus i stormaktstidens Sverige In 1671, she finally married colonel lieutenant Baron Erik Ribbing af Zernava (1640-1675). As was the custom in the Swedish nobility until the late 18th-century, she kept her own name after marriage. She died childless of fever. Her brother, who disliked her way of thinking, decided that her independence had been caused by her education, and resolved that his own daughter would be raised without any education to become a woman without will.Scheutz, Lisbet, Ber√∂mda och gl√∂mda stockholmskvinnor : sju stadsvandringar : 155 kvinnoportr√§tt. - 2001. - S. 127-131 See also * Vendela Skytte References * Norrhem, Svante (2007).

She served for almost two years as a privateer, before returning to the service of the French Navy. After captured her in 1803, the Royal Navy took her in under her existing name as a 20-gun post ship. Bacchante served in the West Indies, where she captured several armed Spanish and French vessels before the Navy sold her in 1809. French service Bacchante was built to a design by Charles-Henri Tellier. She was a \\"flat-bottomed vessel, destined to protect the entrances to rivers\\".Winfield and Roberts (2015), p. 173. Between 1797 and 1798 Bacchante served as a privateer under Captain Pierre Lefortier.Soci√©t√© havraise d'√©tudes diverses (1909) Recueil des publications, Vol. 76-77, p.57. By 1801 Bacchante was back in naval service and at Havre under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Bellenger.Fonds Marine, 1790-1804, p. 259. In 1802 and 1803, sailed Brest-San Domingo-Brest. At the outbreak of war after the collapse of the Treaty of Amiens, Bacchante came under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Fran√ßois- Louis Kerimel and joined Volage and Observateur.Roche, p. 44. Capture On 25 June 1803 Endymion captured Bacchante near the Azores after a chase of eight hours. Bacchante was returning to Brest after a three-month voyage to San Domingo. Kerimel's attempts to escape resulted in Bacchante losing eight men killed and nine wounded; her return fire caused no casualties on Endymion. Captain Charles Paget of Endymion described Bacchante as a \\"remarkably fine Ship, of large Dimensions, quite New, and sails very fast.\\" British career Bacchante arrived at Plymouth on 23 July 1803. She then remained there undergoing fitting between October 1803 and February 1804. Captain Charles Dashwood commissioned Bacchante in November 1803. On 18 February Bacchante was at Plymouth under orders to proceed station herself off Falmouth to meet the Lisbon and Oporto convoys and escort them to their ports.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 11, p.172. Dashwood then sailed her for Jamaica in June 1804. On 3 April 1805, Bacchante captured the Spanish naval schooner Elizabeth of ten guns and 47 men under the command of Don Josef Fer Fexegron. Elizabeth had been carrying dispatches from the Spanish governor of Pensacola, but had thrown these overboard before her capture. Dashwood found out that there were three privateers at Mariel, a little west of Havana, and decided to try to capture them. The first step was to send in Bacchantes boats to take a round tower that was protecting the harbour. The tower stood 40' high, had three 24-pounders on its top, loopholes for muskets around its circumference, and had a garrison of a captain and 30 men. The attack commenced in the evening of 5 April, with the British capturing the fort despite heavy fire. The 13 British seamen and marines suffered one man wounded before they landed; the Spanish had two killed and three wounded. Leaving a sergeant and six marines to guard the prisoners, the boats then headed into the harbour. There they discovered that the privateers had left the day before. Still, despite heavy small-arms fire, the British succeeded in bringing out two schooners carrying sugar. One month later Bacchante was off Havana. Here, on 14 May, she captured the Spanish letter of marque Felix. Felix, pierced for ten guns though carrying six, had a crew of 42 men under the command of Francisco Lopez and was carrying a cargo of beeswax and coffee when Bacchante captured her after a four-hour chase. Felix had left Havana the day before and was the first vessel to have left that port since the imposition of the British embargo. By 27 May Bacchante had arrived at Deal in company with the hired armed ship . They brought in four returning East Indiamen as well as a number of other vessels from Jamaica, Lisbon, and Oporto.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.153. On 22 June Bacchante and the frigate left Portsmouth escorting a convoy for the West Indies.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.164. Circa July 1805 Commander Randall M'Donnell assumed command of Bacchante. On 18 November she captured the Spanish privateer Dos Azares. Bacchante was off the north-east end of Cuba when she sighted a schooner near land. Knowing that Bacchante was not fast, M'Donnell, rather than chasing the schooner, pretended to take flight, luring the privateer into chasing him. When the privateer realised her mistake, M'Donnell gave chase and after about seven hours succeeded in capturing her. Dos Azares was armed with two 3-pounder guns and had a crew of 36 men under the command of Captain Ealletam Garcia. She was four days out of Cuba and had not yet captured anything. In the engagement, Dos Azares had three men wounded; Bacchante had no casualties. In August 1806 Commander James Dacres replaced M'Donnell. On 29 August, in the evening, Bacchante was patrolling off Santa-Martha. Dacres sent her boats to capture or destroy some Spanish vessels at anchor in the harbour. At 1 A.M. on 30 August the boats arrived at the entrance of the harbour and immediately made for the vessels. As they did so, they came under a tremendous, but completely ineffective fire from the vessels, the batteries, and the beach, where several field-pieces had been stationed. The boats brought out three armed vessels, one a brig and two feluccas without having suffered any casualties. (A latter report said she had one man wounded.) Dacres reported that the three vessels were: * Brig of unknown name and four guns. A later report referred to her as a French brig whose crew had escaped. * Spanish letter of marque Sebastian of one gun and 30 men, which had been traveling from St Sebastian to Vera Cruz; * Spanish privateer Desiade of one gun and 30 men, which had been bound for St Jago do Cuba. The brig was the William, of four guns, which had been sailing from Liverpool to Africa when the Spanish captured her. Bacchante and her prizes arrived at Jamaica on 5 September.Lloyd's List, no. 4103, - accessed 15 February 2014. On 14 February 1807, Bacchante captured the French navy schooner Dauphin off Cape Raphael after a 10-hour chase. Dauphin mounted one long 12-pounder gun and two 4-pounders, but she threw the 4-pounders overboard during the chase. She had a crew of 71 men and Dacres was extremely happy to have captured her as she had been preying successfully on British trade. Dacres then fell in with Captain Wise and Mediator in the Mona Passage. Both were patrolling, looking for French warships and privateers, so Dacres took Mediator under his command and hatched a plan to raid the port of Samana, \\"that nest of privateers\\". Dacres had Dauphin come into the harbour under her French flag, with Bacchante disguised as her prize and Mediator, a former merchantman, appearing to be a neutral ship. This stratagem permitted the British vessels to navigate into the harbour and anchor within a half a mile of the fort before the enemy realised that they were British vessels. After a four-hour exchange of fire with a fort manned primarily by men from the privateers in the harbour, the fort fell to a land attack by the seamen and marines from Bacchante and Mediator, the landing party being under Wise's command. The British captured two French schooners undergoing fitting as privateers, and an American ship and a British schooner, both prizes to French privateers. Before they left on 21 February, the British destroyed the fort and its guns. Mediator bore the brunt of the fort's fire. Dacres had four men wounded; Wise had two men killed and 12 wounded. Dacres estimated that French casualties had been high, but did not have a number as the Frenchmen took to the woods as the fort fell. The Lloyd's Patriotic Fund subsequently awarded both Dacres and Wise a sword each worth ¬£100 that bore the inscriptions: * \\"From the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's to James Richard Dacres Esqr. Capt. of H.M.S. Bacchante for his Gallant Conduct in the Capture of the French National Schooner Dauphin and the Destruction of the Fort and Cannon in the Harbour of Samana on 16th February 1807 effected by the Bacchante in company with H.M.S. Mediator as Recorded in the London Gazette of the 25th of April\\".Lloyd's Patriotic Fund, - accessed 14 February 2014. * \\"From the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's to William Furlong Wise Esq.

By September 1807 Bacchante was under the command of Commander Samuel Hood Inglefield. On 13 September, was chasing a suspicious schooner when Bacchante came up and cut the quarry off, which then struck. The vessel turned out to be the Spanish privateer Amor de la Patria under Captain Josse de Tournecy. She was armed with three guns and had a crew of 63 men. She was five days out of (St Iago) but had not taken any prizes. On 5 October Bacchante recaptured the Atalanta, Kneal, master. On 11 May 1808 Bacchante captured the French navy brig Griffon off Cape Antonio. Bacchante pursued Griffon for almost seven hours, and fought her for a half an hour, Griffon only struck when she found herself crowded some 100 metres from the breakers with Bacchante only some 200 meters from her. Griffon was armed with fourteen 24-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder guns, and had a crew of 105 men under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Jacques Gautier. In the engagement Griffon had five men wounded, while Bacchante had suffered no casualties. Griffon had sailed from Rochefort to Martinique via Pensacola. Bacchante sent her into Jamaica.Lloyd's List, no. 4280, - accessed 15 February 2014. There the Royal Navy took Griffon, which was relatively new, into service as HMS Griffon. On 10 June 1808 Commander William Ward of Pelican received promotion to post captain in Bacchante, replacing Inglefield, who transferred to . Ward then sailed Bacchante back to Britain. Fate The Commissioners of the Navy offered Bacchante for sale at Portsmouth in July 1809. She was sold on 2 July.

He subspecializes in pediatric neurosurgery at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), and is a Senior Scientist in the Research Institute at SickKids. His main clinical interests include the neurosurgical treatment of children with brain tumours and epilepsy. His research interests lie in the molecular biology of human brain tumours ‚Äì specifically in the determination of the mechanisms by which brain tumours grow and invade. He is the Director of the Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumour Research Centre at SickKids, and Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Neurosurgery. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2015.\\"Four Nova Scotians among Order of Canada honourees\\". The Chronicle- Herald, July 1, 2015.  Education and training  Rutka was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He studied Chemical Engineering at Princeton University before obtaining his Doctor of Medicine from Queen's University in 1981. Following an internship at McGill University's Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Rutka embarked on his neurosurgery residency training at the University of Toronto beginning in 1982. From 1984 to 1987, he undertook graduate studies at the University of California, San Francisco and worked in the Brain Tumour Research Centre. There, he received his PhD in Experimental Pathology from the School of Graduate Studies in 1987. Upon completion of his residency training in 1990 and receipt of certification in neurosurgery as a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (FRCSC), Rutka completed a clinical fellowship in microvascular neurosurgery with Kenichiro Sugita at Nagoya University followed by a post-doctoral research fellowship in molecular immunology under the supervision of Ko Okumura at Juntendo University in Tokyo in 1990. Professional life Rutka joined the Department of Surgery in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto in 1990. He was appointed to Sick Kids Hospital, where he contributed to a variety of techniques to treat children with neurosurgical conditions. He also established the first brain tumour research laboratory at Sick Kids focusing on the molecular biology and genetics of paediatric and adult brain tumours. In 1997, and in collaboration with his colleagues in Toronto, Rutka was influential in establishing the Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumour Research Centre at Sick Kids, now one of the largest centres of its kind in the world. In 1999, Rutka was appointed Professor in Neurosurgery in the Department of Surgery, and the Dan Family Professor and Chair of the Division of Neurosurgery, a position he held until 2010. Currently, Rutka is the RS McLaughlin Chair of the Department of Surgery at the University of Toronto.  Research and clinical interests  Rutka was a leader in his application of neurosurgical techniques to pediatric neurosurgical patients with a variety of neurosurgical disorders including craniofacial anomalies, brain tumours, congenital malformations, and epilepsy. With his colleagues, he helped introduce digital camera technology to assist with mapping of intra-operative seizure foci. He was among the first to utilize frameless stereotactic neuronavigation techniques to resect cerebral and skull base lesions in children; and he has amassed a large neurosurgical experience in treating children with epilepsy arising from lesions within highly eloquent and critical regions of the brain. In addition, Rutka and colleagues have used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to identify regions of epileptogenesis amenable to neurosurgical resection. Over the course of his research career, Rutka has made several contributions to the understanding of the molecular biology of human brain tumours. He has established several novel human brain tumour cell lines and models to study glioma invasion; he was among the first to characterize the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain, and its degradation by proteolytic enzymes secreted by glioma cells; he has analyzed the importance of the Rho-GTPase pathway in glioma migration and invasion; and he has studied methods of delivering therapeutic agents across the blood-brain barrier to treat experimental brain tumours. Publications and editorships Rutka has published over 500 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on pediatric neurosurgery, the molecular biology of brain tumours, epilepsy surgery, and surgical education. In 2014, he was appointed as the 7th Editor- in-Chief of the Journal of Neurosurgery, and the first Canadian neurosurgeon to hold this position. He has co-edited several neurosurgical textbooks including Neuro-Oncology of CNS Tumors (2006). Sports Rutka played numerous sports in high school and University. He set the Canadian midget triple jump record in 1972. In high school, he was drafted by the Peterborough Petes OHA Jr A hockey team, but chose instead to attend Princeton University to study chemical engineering. At Princeton, Rutka played varsity football and ran track and field. In medical school at Queen's University, Rutka was quarterback of the varsity football team that won the Vanier Cup in 1978 against the University of British Columbia. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0IUgmTD-rI Recognition In 2004, Rutka received the Grass Award for sustained contributions in neurosurgical research from the Society of Neurological Surgeons. In 2006, he was inducted as a Knight of the Order of Smile, by Kawaler Orderu Usmiechu. In 2009, he was the Honored Guest Laureate for the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. Rutka delivered the Penfield Lecture at the 45th Annual Congress of the Canadian Neurological Sciences Federation in 2010. That same year, he was appointed as President of the American American Association of Neurological Surgeons. In 2011, he was inducted as a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2012, Rutka was appointed as President of the American Academy of Neurological Surgery. In 2014, Rutka was made a Member of the Order of Ontario, and he received an honorary PhD, Honoris Causa, from Bahcesehir University in Istanbul for longstanding contributions to brain tumour research. In 2015, Rutka received the Robert L. Noble Prize from the Canadian Cancer Society, the Margolese National Brain Disorders Prize from the University of British Columbia, and he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2019, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) awarded Dr. Rutka with the Cushing Medal : the most prestigious award an AANS member can receive.

Early years Zepherin Ferrez was born in Saint-Laurent, France in 1797. In 1810 he began his training in printmaking and sculpture in Paris with Philippe-Laurent Roland (1746‚Äì1816) and Pierre-Nicolas Beauvallet (1750‚Äì1818). Career Pedro II of Brazil by Ferrez (1839) Z√©phyrin Ferrez was a member of the Miss√£o Art√≠stica Francesa (French Artistic Mission) organized by Joachim Lebreton which brought a group of artists to Brazil, arriving on 25 March 1816. These included his brother, the sculptor Marc Ferrez (1788‚Äì1850), the painter Jean-Baptiste Debret (1768‚Äì1848), the sculptor Auguste Marie Taunay and his brother the painter Nicolas Antoine Taunay (1755‚Äì1830), the engraver Charles-Simon Pradier (1786‚Äì1847) and the architect Auguste-Henri-Victor Grandjean de Montigny (1776‚Äì1850). They were to form the nucleus of a royal art academy in Brazil. The arrival of the French group caused some controversy among the local Portuguese intelligentsia, who were concerned at the excessive influence being given to the French in developing the cultural life of Brazil. In turn, the French were unhappy with political appointments such as the appointment of Henrique Jos√© da Silva as head of the school in place of Lebreton. This was the reason why Tauney's brother, Nicholas Antoine Taunay, returned to France. In 1817 Z√©phyrin Ferrez worked with Auguste Marie Taunay, Debret and Grandjean de Montigny on decorating Rio de Janeiro for the festivities surrounding the arrival of the Princess Maria Leopoldina of Austria (1797‚Äì1826). Z√©phyrin and Marc Ferrez sculpted and decorated the bassinet offered to Pedro I of Brazil (1798‚Äì1834) on the occasion of the birth of his first daughter, Princess Maria da Gl√≥ria. Based on this work he was admitted to the artistic circle of the Imperial Academy of Beaux Arts. In 1820 he engraved the Senatus Fluminense medal in honor of the acclamation of King John VI of Portugal, who had been enthroned in 1818. That year he obtained a permanent position as professor on medal engraving at the Academy. In 1826 the brothers Ferrez made a set of bas-reliefs and clay sculptures for the facade of the Academy building. Z√©phyrin Ferrez died in Rio de Janeiro in 1851. His son, Marc Ferrez (1843‚Äì1923), became a well-known photographer. Work Z√©phyrin Ferrez undertook various works with his brother Marc Ferrez, including decorating the facade of the Academy building. This included the bas-reliefs of Ph√©b√© on her chair of light and the Genius of Art. He sculpted the scrolls and Ionic capitals of the entrance to the Academy, now in the Botanical Garden. Ferroz was one of the first medal engravers in Brazil, and made various medals commemorating events in the country. As a sculptor he made two bronze busts of Pedro II, and a bronze statue of Pedro I. His students included Manuel de Lima, Chaves Pinheiro (1822‚Äì1884) and Jos√© da Silva Santos.

She was promoted shortly thereafter, and as a publicist for the label she worked with artists including Kid Rock, Sugar Ray, P.O.D., Jewel, and Stone Temple Pilots. In 1997, she was promoted to national director of media relations, and transferred from Atlantic's Los Angeles office to their New York headquarters. She left the company in 2001 to accept a job at Columbia Records. At Columbia, Cob-Baehler supervised the label's West Coast press department while working with John Mayer, System of a Down, The Offspring, Coheed and Cambria, and the Raveonettes, among others. She was named Vice President of Publicity in 2002 and soon met then 17-year-old Katy Perry, who had yet to release an album on the label, and became one of her earliest supporters. In 2005, Cob-Baehler was named senior vice president of publicity at Virgin Records. At Virgin, she was responsible for press campaigns for artists including Thirty Seconds to Mars, Joss Stone, KT Tunstall, and Iggy Pop and the Stooges. When the Virgin label was merged with Capitol/EMI, she was appointed to the position of senior vice president of media and creative services for EMI Music's associated labels: Angel, Astralwerks, Blue Note, Capitol, Capitol Latin, Manhattan, and Virgin. With Perry's album unreleased by Columbia, Cob-Baehler began a campaign to bring her to Capitol Music Group in 2005. She gained the support of Jason Flom, then the CEO of the label, and Perry was signed to Capitol/Virgin in 2006. Cob-Baehler was credited for creative direction and A&R; on Perry's album One of the Boys, which went on to sell more than 5,000,000 albums worldwide. She also served as the creative director for Perry's Teenage Dream. Cob-Baehler continued to work closely with Perry until Cob-Baehler left EMI in 2011 to become executive vice president of marketing at Epic Records. In addition to heading marketing at Epic, Cob- Baehler served in an a&r; capacity, and notably signed the controversial hip hop band Death Grips, who were named Spin magazine's \\"Artist of the Year\\" in 2012. In February 2013, Cob-Baehler joined The Firm/The Online Network as the head of marketing and associate producer. Then known as Prospect Park Productions, she led the marketing campaign for the soap operas All My Children and One Life to Live about which The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Not only are they (TOLN) the first company to revive a long-running daytime drama (thus changing the game for the genre entirely) they are taking two brands with a combined age of over 80 years and basically making them cool again.‚Äù Production was halted in 2013 due to a dispute with ABC, and both series were ultimately cancelled. Following the cancellation, Cob-Baehler transitioned to a position as an artist manager. She was promoted to head the Firm's music operations in June 2016,. She also served as the chief marketing officer for Big 3, a basketball league founded by Jeff Kwatinetz and Ice Cube. Cob- Baehler appeared on Billboard's 2011 list of prominent women in music.

Early life and education Lily Thapa was born on in Kathmandu, Nepal. A daughter of the Army chief, Lily showed high aptitude and academic promise from very young age, passing her high school at just the age of 14, from Padma Kanya College, Nepal. She also went on to attain a bachelor's degree in (Major: psychology and home science) from the same institute at 17 years of age. Following a gap of some years after this, Lily secured a master's degree in Sociology and Anthropology, from Tribhuwan University, Nepal. She spent subsequent years in Sweden where she completed another Post Graduation in Women-in-management from the Luleo University, Sweden. In 2012, Lily returned to her alma mater seeking her PhD in the subject: Sociological Aspects on Impacts of conflict in Nepal, one that she is currently pursuing. The story of Lily Thapa Lily was only 29 years old when her husband, an Army doctor died in the Gulf War in 1994, leaving her in a state of sadness, wrought on due to the loss of her husband, as well as because of her ‚Äònew status‚Äô as a widow. Overnight, Lily went from being an educated and accomplished woman running a Primary School, to having almost no status or sense of personal identity, as dictated by Nepalese society. It was during this period that Lily first came into contact with the grim reality of widowhood in Nepalese society, as well as the reprehensible treatment and practices forced upon women, making them virtually disappear. That was when lily Thapa resolved to become what she is today, a selfless and dedicated woman who inspires those around her with the extraordinary strength and confidence that she carries. Today Lily, at the helm of WHR (Women for Human Rights), has given a new horizon of hope to over 500,000 women, constantly working to uplift and empower them and inspire many more like them. Career As indicated by her academic incline and qualifications, Lily specialises in the fields of social work, teaching, counselling and other like activities. She is the founded the RoseBud School in 1990, where she stayed on as Principal, until she sold it in 1996, so as to focus all of her energy and attention on her women's rights organisation/NGO. The WHR story One day a Jesuit priest from Lily's children's boarding school approached her, asking her help in speaking with another young woman who was suffering from the throes of widowhood, in an effort to help her find solace. And so Lily, herself being 45-days widowed, went to the home of the mother-in-law of the young woman. The young woman, Laxmi, told Lily a horrific tale of an unhappy marriage, and sexual abuse at the hands of her brother-in-law, moving Lily a great deal and spurring her into resolute action. Thus began in 1992, a 2-year long stint of monthly informal discussion-based sharing sessions/meetings for widows (single women), presided over by Lily as well as occasional talks from experts. These sessions proved quite fruitful as they provided an opportunity for widows (single women) to share their problems and stories with one another, thus helping them achieve relief through the solace of togetherness. Then 2 years later in 1994, WHR (Women for Human Rights) was registered as a formal organisation, with lily at the helm as Founder and Chairperson. Today, over 20 years later, Lily has grown WHR into one of Nepal's largest NGO's, encompassing almost the entire length and breadth of the nation, with over 1500 VDC's (Village Development Committees) and a total of over 100,000 single women under its wing. Current Affiliations Over the years Lily has built up and garnered professional affiliations with various organisations that are involved in social works, teaching, counselling, rehabilitation and other such fields. She is currently involved with her old intermediate high school, Padma Kanya College, as a lecturer/visiting faculty. She is the President of the Sankalp foundation that is involved in the co-ordination of a large network of women organisations, with the aim of implementing the National Action Plan on UNSCR1325 and 1820. Lily is also the General-Secretary of SANWED (South Asian Network of Widows‚Äô Empowerment and Development), an organisation that attempts to mainstream the issues of South Asian women into major policy, through extensive lobbying. She also serves as an Advisor for the Nispakchya foundation, which is a network of conflict affected women (CAW). Liliy is a key member of the think tank of the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare, of the Govt of Nepal. Published works Over the years Lily Thapa has developed and published various pieces of literature on gender security, women's rights and empowerment, as well as multiple training manuals. Here are some of her most notable publications: *Published book on Role of Women for Peace-building in Nepal‚Äì2008 *Published book on An Understanding on Gender‚Äì2008 *Published handbook on Transitional Justice in Nepal-2010 *Published book on Status of Single Women in Nepal‚Äì2010 *Published Handbook on Women, Peace and Security-2011 *Developed training manual and handbook on UNSCR1325 for the security forces-2014 *Developed curriculum on women, peace and security for class 9 and 10- 2017 Awards Throughout her career as a social worker and educator, Lily Thapa has received various awards and accolades recognizing her dedicated service to the cause of gender equality in Nepal, and toward the community as a whole: *Prabal Gorkha Award-by the President of Nepal- 2013: for her contribution towards women empowerment *Best Social Entrepreneur Award-by the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare-2008 *Woman Manager of the Year (2007)-by Management Association of Nepal (MAN) *Ashoka Fellow Award-by Ashoka International USA-2003 *Synergos Fellowship-2012 *Social Worker of the Year-2008 References Category:Nepalese activists Category:Nepalese women activists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Lily Thapa"},{"id":"41955635","text":"John de Leon (born February 14, 1962 in Miami, Florida) is a retired Cuban- American attorney known for his work on immigration and civil rights issues.

It is located south of the road from Fush√´-Kruja to Kruja. Zg√´rdhesh is somewhat of a mystery because it is unmentioned in ancient sources. Some scholars believe, however, that it may be the site of ancient Albanopolis, referred to by Pliny the Elder. The Illyrian settlement here seems to have been founded in the 7th or 6th century BC and flourished in the 4th and 3rd centuries, before being abandoned in the 2nd century BC, when the inhabitants moved to Durr√´s and Lezha. Name The toponym Zg√´rdhesh first occurs in 1431, in a Turkish document as Ozgurta√®, and subsequently, in 1641, in the Italian chronicle of Marco Scura as Sgurdessi. History Map It is thought that the original city had an overall area of 20 hectares. Construction originates from several periods, the first of which belongs to typical construction of the 6th century BC (blocks of stones with minimal carvings), and is typical of the construction at the top of the hill, where the first settlement must have been centered. A second construction period (5th century BC) is characterized by the use of cubical blocks, and includes the construction of most of the city walls, the towers, and the acropolis, as well as the most important buildings. Archaeological artifacts (roof tiles seals with stamps on them) are witness of at least 5 ceramic manufacturing sites, which furnished the city with roofing materials. Other manufacturing sites produced amphoras, terracottas, and different dishes found onsite. An Illyrian helmet has also been found and it is thought that they were all local products. Commerce of the city is shown by artefacts of ceramics that were typical of Dyrrachium and Lissus, as well as coins, principally of Dyrrachium, all of which belong to the late 4th century BC through the 2nd century BC. In addition a statue of Artemis has been found, as well as various ornamental terracottas, which show the presence of a cultural life in the city. It is thought that the Illyrian Wars weakened the city and then the eventual Roman invasion caused the abandoning of the city, which has remained uninhabited since. Among the remains at Zg√´rdhesh are 1,350 meters of fortification walls and heavily decayed terraces and towers spread over a hillside of 8.2 hectares. The original city was built on the acropolis but there is little to see in the way of visible remains except a section of the eastern defensive wall, with a tower on the northeast corner. Just inside the entrance are the foundations of an early Christian chapel, a very small building indicating the continued occupation of the site in later antiquity, but also its greatly diminished importance.

According to this theory, the manifested effect is pre-existent in the cause; and the original cause of everything that is perceived (Prakriti) is Purusha, which is eternal consciousness.  Overview  Satkaryavada is the Samkhya theory of the pre- existent effect, which states that the effect Karya already exists in its material cause, which is Sat, and therefore nothing new is brought into existence. This theory uses two basic concepts. * Sat(‡§∏‡§§‡•ç) ‚Äì pure being or existence * Karya(‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø)- the manifested effect This theory asserts that something that exists (Sat), cannot originate from non-existence (Asat). Therefore, it denies the creation of universe and states that universe is unborn and eternal. This theory, also associated with the Yoga school, is the systematic unfolding of Uddalaka Aruni‚Äôs 'substantialism' and 'eternalism' (Sassatavada). Ishvarakrishna in his Samkhyakarika Sl.9 gives five reasons why the effect has to pre-exist in its material cause ‚Äì ‡§Ö‡§∏‡§¶‡§ï‡§∞‡§£‡§æ‡§¶‡•Å‡§™‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§®‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡§£‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§æ‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡•§ ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§∞‡§£‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§£‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç ‡•• ‡•Ø ‡••https://web.archive.org/web/20120223144612/http://www.sanskritdocuments.org/all_pdf/IshvarakRiShNasAnkyakArikA.pdf # what is not cannot be produced, # the effect requires a material cause, # not everything arises from everything, # the cause produces only what corresponds to its potential # the effect has the nature of the cause.  Vedic roots  During Vedic times, in seeking to determine the rta or order underlying all phenomena, a postulation was made that change can be understood in terms of a potency inherent in these phenomena, that is, in the cause to produce the effect, this potency was termed svadha (own power). But later on, the reality of change itself came into question. However, the Upanishads and Samkhya, though differing on whether phenomenal change was an illusion or real, accepted satkaryavada. Svadha and satkaryavada go beyond efficient causation to partake of nature of formal and material cause. Pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda of the Buddhists implies a non-linear kind of causality; the word paccaya of paccaya-namarupa literally means support, and this presents causation not in terms of unilateral power but in terms of relationship. The Buddhists consider all modes of relation to have casual significance.  Vedanta explanation  From Chandogya Upanishad III.19 and Taittiriya Upanishad II.7, it appears that being emerged from the pregnant and undifferentiated chaos known as asat ('non-being') but the Brahmanas describe creation as the transformation of sat referred to as the impersonal abstract reality (Taittiriya Upanishad II.i ) or as the personal creator (Prasna Upanishad I.4); satkaryavada envisages creation as parinama::vikara ('modification') of Brahman (Brahma Sutras II.i.7) which orthodox view is not accepted by the followers of Advaita Vedanta who place their belief in Vivartavada, the theory of superimposition. Gaudapada, advocating ajativada, states that mithya ('false', 'unreal') effect has a mithya origination; it is not a real origination. Therefore, Totakacharya, a disciple of Sankara, in Srutisarasamuddharanam Sloka 151 states ‚Äì even if one thinks that the world, beginning with the mind, does somehow originate according to either the prior existence or the non-existence (of the effect), even then it is not real; for the sruti has declared that it is unreal. According to Vedanta, Brahman, the ever-existing non-dual entity sat but who is the eternal subject and not an object to be known, is the sole source of joy (rasah), a non-entity cannot be a source of happiness. Brahman is the cause of creation. As Saguna Brahman or Ishvara, with his power of the beginningless maya, he brings forth this creation which is also beginningless, controls and rules it as the Lord within. Maya is Prakrti (avayakrta) composed of three Gunas. Sankara extends satkaryavada to state that creation is but manifestation of names and forms only; by transforming into Becoming the indeterminate becomes determinate in association with maya, otherwise the world is unreal ‚Äì the acosmic approach shows creation to be a superimposition on Brahman whereas according to the subjective approach the phenomenal world of diversity is unreal, a mere dream. Sankara defends satkaryavada against asatkaryavada but in the light of vivartavada as distinguished from parinamavada, he posits the infinite and eternal as the goal of human aspirations, distinguishing paramartha and vyavahara and agreeing that the former is timeless and the latter, fundamentally impermanent and insubstantial, differing though in their analysis of empirical things and causality. He states that the sruti speaks of prarabdha from an empirical point of view; prarabdha is accepted for origination (or birth) to account for differences of beings etc., which difference cannot be otherwise produced. In the same context but opposing Sankara‚Äôs view-point, Ramanuja, the proponent of Vishishtadvaita, in his Vedarthasangraha defines creation thus ‚Äì Brahman whose body is formed by animate and inanimate beings, who in his gross form is divided by distinctions of names and forms, is presented in the effect; this disunited and gross state of Brahman is called creation. LA_Una=the one&only;(via;birth mother inner voice),known information from her inner soul. One who can change the course of history after pasdt life attempts.  Samkhya delineation  Satkaryavada is the Samkhya theory of the pre-existent effect, that the effect () already exists in its material cause and therefore, nothing new is brought into existence or produced in the process of creation. This theory, also associated with the Yoga school, is the systematic unfolding of Udalaka Aruni‚Äôs (Chandogya Upanishad VI.i.4-5) 'substantialism' and 'eternalism'. Ishvarakrishna in his Samkhyakarika (Sloka 9): :‡§Ö‡§∏‡§¶‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç ‡§â‡§™‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ‡§® ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡§£‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠‡§µ‡§æ‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç  :‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§£‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç  gives five reasons why the effect has to pre-exist in its material cause ‚Äì a) - what is not cannot be produced, b) - the effect requires a material cause, c) - not everything arises from everything, d) - the cause produces only what corresponds to its potential and e) - the effect has the nature of the cause. The followers of the Samkhya school hold that ('effect') is ('existent') even before ('causal operation') renders ('manifest') from ('unmanifest condition'). The Samkhyas uphold Parinama-vada, that the cause is continuously transforming itself into effect. They advocate two eternal realities, Prakrti and Purusha; the five-fold reasoning for the inference of Purusha are (Samkhyakarika Sl.10)‚Äì :‡§π‡•á‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§¶‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§™‡§ø ‡§∏‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§®‡•á‡§ï‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡§Ç ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡§Æ‡•ç  :‡§∏‡§æ‡§µ‡§Ø‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§‡§Æ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡•ç  Prakrti and its evolutes all serve the purpose of the self which is Consciousness, b) the self whose purpose is served by Prakrti must be different from everything composed of the three gunas, c) experiences suggest a transcendental synthetic unity of pure consciousness to co-ordinate all experiences for knowledge pre-supposes the existence of the self, d) the physical universe needs a sentient purusha to experience it and e) there is the desire to escape from prakrti (Samkhyakarika Sl.10).  Opposition  Asatkaryavada also called the arambhavada or new beginning. Against the asatkaryavada view of causality accepted by the Nyaya and the Vaisheshikas, the Samkhyas aver that if the effect were something totally new, without prior existence in any form, then one would have to admit the production of existence from non-existence, which is not possible. But Sankara questions the Samkhya contention, he asks ‚Äì if the effect actually pre-exists how can there be genuine change?

A gift from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, it was dedicated on September 16, 2000 during a state visit of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the presence of US President Bill Clinton. Sparked to action in the wake of the 50th anniversary of Indian independence in 1947, the US Congress passed a bill in 1998 authorising the Government of India to establish a memorial to Gandhi on US federal land in the District of Columbia. The bronze statue depicts Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in ascetic garb, in reference to his 1930 march against the salt tax in India. It was designed by Gautam Pal, a sculptor from Kolkata. The statue is mounted on a 16 ton plinth of ruby granite from Ilkal, Karnataka, standing in a circular plaza of gray granite pavers. Behind it are three slabs of Karnataka red granite with inscriptions honoring Gandhi's memory, and in front of it is a seat also of red granite. The statue bears an inscription with Gandhi's answer to a journalist who asked for his message to the world: \\"My life is my message.\\" The Mahatma Gandhi Memorial unveiled in Milwaukee in 2002 includes a similar statue by Gautam Pal, also mounted on a red granite plinth.

Designs are released under Creative Commons licenses. One of Opendesk's goals is to eliminate the cost of shipping completed products in favour of local fabrication. Opendesk was founded by Ian Bennink, Tim Carrigan, James Arthur, Joni Steiner and Nick Ierodiaconou; the last three founders were part of Development 00, the creators of WikiHouse. The same team previously created FabHub.io, a marketplace designed to allow designers and fabricators to engage with one another.  Concept  Users can choose between four degrees of completion for designs, distinguished by price and the technical fabrication requirements: * Plans, in .dwg and .dwx formats, and instructions in PDF, for the experienced carpenter capable of building furniture from scratch * Packs of raw wood, pre- sawn by CNC machine * Flat pack furniture that is cut, oiled and ready to be assembled * Completed and assembled final products Opendesk's designs use a system of interlocking wooden fins to hold pieces together firmly without nails or bolts. The choice of wood to use is up to the builder; in the United Kingdom, a popular choice has been birch and plywood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. , the Opendesk range featured six items: the Desk, Caf√© Table, Meeting Table, Edie set, Edie Stool and Edie Table.  History  The project was born out of a commission for furniture for a tech startup in London, England. When the startup's sister office in New York City required furniture, it was decided to manufacture it locally rather than ship the completed product. Opendesk targets startups along with creative companies and nonprofit organisations as a customer base. These types of organisations typically request flat pack products, while commercial organisations prefer fully assembled furniture.  Reception  Opendesk was the subject of an exhibition named \\"The Future Is Here\\" at the Design Museum in London, which ran until October 2013. It featured designs from around the world, with assigned QR codes which can be used to access information on each design and its creator.

January 11, 937Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.), formally the Prince of Yong (), was an imperial prince of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Later Tang, as a son of its last emperor Li Congke.  Background  It is not known when Li Chongmei was born ‚Äî although he was both described by historians as \\"young, but as intelligent and agile as an adult\\"New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 16. and self-described as a \\"child\\" even as of his death year, suggesting that he was not yet of adult age at that point. It is not known who his mother was, including whether she was Li Congke's wife Lady Liu (later empress) or not. He was Li Congke's second son.Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 51.  During Li Congke's reign  In 934, Li Chongmei's father Li Congke overthrew his adoptive brother (Li Chongmei's uncle) Li Conghou, who was then emperor, and took the throne himself. As Li Chongmei's older brother Li Chongji () and sister Li Huiming () were executed by Li Conghou during Li Congke's rebellion, Li Chongmei was effectively Li Congke's only son (or oldest ‚Äî although historical records did not suggest that Li Congke had any younger sons). Apparently shortly after Li Congke took the throne, he gave Li Chongmei the title of imperial guard general, and shortly after gave him the titles of military governor (Jiedushi) of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the region of the capital Luoyang), and commander of the imperial guards.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. His military governorship was later moved from Chengde to Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei). (He did not appear to have reported to either circuit, and Tianxiong was later given to Empress Liu's brother, Liu Yanhao.) In spring 936, Li Congke created Li Chongmei the Prince of Yong. Not long after, Li Chongmei's uncle (the husband of his aunt the Princess of Jin), Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), rebelled with aid from the Khitan Empire. When the main Later Tang forces Li Congke sent to attack Shi, commanded by Zhang Jingda, was defeated and surrounded by the combined Khitan/Hedong forces, Li Congke's high-level officials were all pushing for him to personally lead the imperial army against Shi. Li Chongmei volunteered to go in his stead, stating: Li Congke, who was hesitant to face Shi, initially was inclined to grant Li Chongmei's request, but the chancellor Zhang Yanlang, Liu Yanhao, and the director of palace affairs Liu Yanlang () were all urging Li Congke himself to go, and therefore he launched his army, but he advanced slowly, fearful of Shi. He left Li Chongmei in charge of Luoyang. As continued news of Later Tang defeats were arriving at Luoyang (including the assassination of Zhang Jingda by his deputy Yang Guangyuan and Yang's subsequent surrender to Khitan/Hedong forces, as well as the defeat of another Later Tang army, commanded by Zhao Dejun), the people in the city were panicking and trying to leave the city and hide in mountains and valleys nearby. The guards at the city gates were initially inclined to stop them. Li Chongmei, however, stated: He thus opened the gates and allowed the people to leave, which actually served to calm the people's hearts. Shortly after, Li Congke returned to Luoyang, trying to mount a defense there, but with Shi approaching Luoyang and his generals submitting to Shi in droves, Li Congke gathered his family members and a number of officers still loyal to him and prepared to commit suicide by fire at Xuanwu Tower (). Empress Liu, however, also planned to burn down the entire palace complex. Li Chongmei persuaded her not to, stating to her, \\"The new Son of Heaven surely cannot sleep under open air. He would only, at a future time, expend the energy of the people to rebuild. How is it that we should die and leave the people to hate us?\\" Shortly after, Li Congke's family, including Empress Liu and Li Chongmei, committed suicide by fire.

Early life Shrestha composed his first song \\"Ma Patharko Deuta Haina\\" when he was 14. He comes from a musical family in Dharan, Nepal. His father Jaya Narayan Shrestha was an ustaad and played violin and flute. His mother Indira Shrestha was a singer. Deep met other musicians early through his father. Deep Shrestha studied bioscience after he passed his SLC exams. He thought that he would continue his studies but he missed his exams thrice because he was busy performing as a musician.  Career  Shrestha formally started his musical career in the late 1960s. This era is deemed as the golden era of Nepali modern music. Before this he performed in cultural programs and other locally organized functions in eastern Nepal. His opportunity to officially pursue music came when a Dharan theatre team came to Kathmandu to stage a drama in Rastriya Nachghar, including the Late King Mahendra. Shrestha portrayed a singer. His melodious voice and well-composed music held everyone spellbound. King Mahendra was so impressed that he allowed Shrestha to record as many songs as he wished. In 2025 (Bikram Sambat), when even established singers had to wait for many days to schedule a recording session at Radio Nepal (the only recording studio then), he was allowed to record six songs. In subsequent years, Shrestha came to Kathmandu once in a year to record. After 2028 B.S., Shrestha started participating in the Nationwide Music Competition, which led to a first prize in vocals in 2030 B.S. for the song \\"Bidhawako Sindoorko Rahar\\". Shrestha was musically active for another decade. Then, slowly, he stopped singing. He was busy with his official work and 'did not feel like recording new songs'. The Nepalese music industry expanded and professionalized. Technology drew him back and he again started singing. Personal life He married Sophiya Gurung who is originally from Darjeeling. They have two daughters. He works as an assistant music director at the Nepal Academy, Nepal. Shrestha has enriched the anthology of Nepali music with hundreds of modern and patriotic songs.

Hoover was a billiard hall owner hanged by vigilantes on April 28, 1880, for the unprovoked murder of a townsman in Fairplay in Park County in central Colorado. Little is known of Hoover's background though he was a prospector in the California Gold Rush in the early 1850s and was in 1880 one of the older residents of Fairplay. The crime Known for his irascible personality, especially when under the influence of alcohol, Hoover on April 1, 1879, stormed into the Fairplay House Hotel and shot and mortally wounded Thomas M. Bennett, a native of Iowa, who was waiting on customers at the counter. Hoover told Bennett that he was taking charge of the hotel because he owned the building, an untruth. When the dying Bennett was asked what could have provoked Hoover, he replied, \\"No, no, no, oh, my God, he did it in cold blood.\\" Hoover declared temporary insanity based on an injury that he had received in an 1871 mining accident in the now ghost town of Oro City, near Leadville in Lake County, Colorado, where he had fallen sixty-five feet down a mineshaft. Hoover told authorities that his injury from the mining accident caused him to engage in \\"temporary fits of insanity.\\" Three witnesses could attest to his accident, Hoover said, but none could travel to Fairplay at the time of the trial.Laura King Van Dusen, \\"Crime and Punishment in 1880s Fairplay: People Protest Light Sentencing, Deliver Frontier Justice\\", Historic Tales from Park County: Parked in the Past (Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2013), , pp. 89-96. With the approval of District Attorney C. W. Burris, Hoover was allowed to change his plea from \\"Not guilty of murder\\" to \\"Guilty of manslaughter. The Colorado Fourth Judicial District Court Judge Thomas M. Bowen gave Hoover an eight-year imprisonment. A year was reduced for his plea of manslaughter, and a second year was credited for time already served while awaiting trial. The lynching Hoover was scheduled to be transported to the Colorado State Penitentiary in Ca√±on City, when early one morning ten to twenty irate citizens, who considered the imprisonment too lenient a punishment for such a heinous crime, broke into the jail in the courthouse in Fairplay and hanged Hoover from a second floor window. Law enforcement officers claimed that they could not find out who was responsible for the crime because the men wore masks and disguised their voices. Hence the actions of the mob went unpunished. Judge Bowen and DA Burris promptly left town, apparently fearful that the mob could pursue them for having participated in meting out such a light sentence in the case. Bowen, like the murder victim Bennett, was an Iowa native. He obtained great wealth in the gold fields of Rio Grande County in southern Colorado. A Republican, Bowen later served in the Colorado House of Representatives from 1882 to 1883 and the United States Senate from 1883 to 1889. Aftermath Hoover, who had been a Fairplay town alderman, is interred at the Fairplay Cemetery near his infant daughter, Louisa, who died at thirteen months in 1878. In 1883, his wife, the former Euphrasia Maxey, married Chandler Potter, who took her to Honduras, where he was employed by a mining company. Ward Maxey, Hoover's brother-in- law, took over Hoover's billiard parlor and later became a sheep rancher. The courthouse building where Hoover was hanged, then only six years old, was in 2013 still in use as the location of the Fairplay library.

This would be the first accident of a Pan Am aircraft in Brazil. Aircraft The Sikorsky S-43 was a Flying Boat seaplane. Pan Am would order 10 units, which would be used on routes connecting the United States to the Caribbean and Latin America. The aircraft involved in the accident was manufactured at the Sikorsky Aircraft Industrial Plant in Bridgeport, CT. It was assigned the serial number \\"4324\\". Construction would be finished on December 20th, 1936. After being flight-tested and approved, it would receive tail number NC 16933 from the Civil Aeronautics Authority. These aircraft would be christened \\"Baby Clipper\\" by Pan Am. The Baby Clippers' began service at Pan Am on September 10th, 1937 and would be retired in 1945. Flight history The aircraft involved was a three-year-old Sikorsky S-43B airliner registered NC16933. It had first flown in 1936, and had accumulated a total of 3,650 flight hours during its career. The aircraft took off from Miami on a scheduled international passenger flight to Rio de Janeiro, with many stopovers across the Caribbean and South America. As it neared its destination, the aircraft circled Rio in preparation for a normal approach. As it was circling, however, the left engine lost power, putting the aircraft into a descending left yaw turn. As the yaw grew sharper, the pitch angle also steepened until the aircraft struck a caisson and crashed into Guanabara Bay, about one kilometer from Rio's Santos Dumont Airport. Of the twelve passengers and four crew members, only two passengers survived.

The hardware-based fault detection and correction features found within this line include dual cores that may run in lock-step, full-path ECC, automated self- testing of memory and logic, peripheral redundancy, and monitor/checker cores.  Qorivva Processor Families  Freescale has selected the following families of MPC5xxx processors for inclusion in the program targeting automotive, commercial, industrial, and aerospace applications, wherein assurances of correctness and safety are primary requirements.  MPC57xx Family  :See also MPC57xx. The MPC57xx Family is intended by its manufacturer to support achievement of system compliance with functional safety standards, ISO 26262 in particular. Freescale's SafeAssure Functional Safety Program includes all members of this family. Within that program, the MPC57xx are the primary microcontrollers targeted for safety-critical automotive applications. Each product in this family features a matched pair of e200 cores intended for primary computation, but also incorporate at least one other e200 core in a support role (e.g., interface coprocessor or \\"Safety Checker\\"). To support attainment of higher levels of fault tolerance (such as those expected in the context of ASIL D), the paired e200 cores may be configured to operate as dual lockstep processors. (An exception is MPC5748G whose cores may not be lock- stepped and as such is intended by the manufacturer to only support attainment of the less critical ASIL B.) Notably, the MPC5777M embodies three e200z7 cores at 300 MHz in a computational shell, two of which may be operated in lock step, and a fourth core, an e200z4, which is used for peripheral control. Additional built-in hardware mechanisms particular to this family: * \\"End to End Error Code Correction\\" (e2eECC) - all memory storage and internal transfers may be protected by error correction encoding having a Hamming Distance of 4, that distance providing automatic single bit-flip error correction and double bit-flip error detection. * Built-In Self Tests of Logic and Memory (LBIST and MBIST, respectively) (normally boot-time operations)  MPC56xx and MPC55xx Families  :See also MPC55xx and MPC56xx. Products in these families each embody one or more e200 cores (usually of different versions). In this family, only the MPC567xK, MPC564xL, and MPC560xP are identified as part of Freescale's SafeAssure Functional Safety Program. Of these, only the MCP5643L features lock-step cores and is the only member of the family explicitly offered in support of ISO 26262. The MPC5643L is notable for Freescale's claims that it is the first automotive microcontroller to be certified by an independent accredited assessor (exida) as compliant with the relevant MCU requirements of the automotive functional safety standard ISO 26262. exida confirms that the Freescale microcontroller MPC5643L has been assessed per the relevant requirements regarding microcontroller development and verification & validation of ISO 26262 : 2011 Parts 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 (to the extent applicable) and meets requirements providing Systematic Integrity ASIL D.

Arkansas adopted the Idaho Stop law in April 2019. The Delaware Yield been considered in several other states, including Oregon which passed such a law in 2019 that went into effect in 2020, and Washington which passed such a law in early 2020 that goes into effect on October 1, 2020. Advocates argue that current law criminalizes normal cycling behavior, and that the Idaho stop makes cycling easier and safer and places the focus where it should be: on yielding the right-of-way. History The original Idaho yield law was introduced as Idaho HB 541 during a comprehensive revision of Idaho Traffic laws in 1982. At that time, minor traffic offenses were criminal offenses and there was a desire to downgrade many of these to \\"civil public offenses\\" to free up docket time. Carl Bianchi, then the Administrative Director of the Courts in Idaho, saw an opportunity to attach a modernization of the bicycle law onto the larger revision of the traffic code. He drafted a new bicycle code that would more closely conform with the Uniform Vehicle Code, and included new provisions allowing cyclists to take the lane, or to merge left, when appropriate. Addressing the concerns of the state's magistrates, who were concerned that \\"technical violations\\" of traffic control device laws by cyclists were cluttering the court, the draft also contained a provision that allowed cyclists to treat a stop sign as a yield sign‚Äîthe so-called \\"rolling stop law.\\" The new bicycle law passed in 1982, despite objections among some cyclists and law enforcement officers. In 2006, the law was modified to specify that cyclists must stop on red lights and yield before proceeding straight through the intersection, and before turning left at an intersection. This had been the original intent, but Idaho law enforcement officials wanted it specified. The law originally passed with an education provision, but that was removed in 1988 because \\"youthful riders quickly adapted to the new system and had more respect for a law that legalized actual riding behavior.\\" In 2001, Joel Fajans, a physics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and Melanie Curry, a magazine editor, published an essay entitled \\"Why Bicyclists Hate Stop Signs\\" on why rolling stops were better for cyclists and it provided greater interest in the Idaho law. The first effort to enact the law outside of Idaho was started in Oregon in 2003, when the Idaho law still only applied to stop signs. While it overwhelmingly passed in the House, it never made it out of the Senate Rules Committee. The Oregon effort in turn inspired an investigation of the law by the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission in 2008.Stop Sign and Traffic Signal Changes for Cyclists That investigation failed to spawn legislation, but it did garner national attention, which led to similar efforts nationwide. The term \\"Idaho Stop\\" came into use as a result of the California effort in 2008. Prior to that, it was called \\"Idaho Style\\" or \\"Roll-and-go.\\" \\"Idaho Stop\\" was first used by the bicycle blogger Richard Masoner in June 2008 coverage of the San Francisco proposal, but in reference to the \\"Idaho Stop Law.\\" In August of the same year, the term‚Äînow in quotes‚Äîfirst showed up in print in a Christian Science Monitor article by Ben Arnoldy who referred to the \\"so-called 'Idaho stop' rule.\\" Soon after, the term \\"Idaho stop\\" was commonly being used as a noun, not a modifier. Positions Advocates for Idaho stop laws argue that they improve safety. One study showed that Idaho has less severe crashes. Similarly, tests of a modified form of the Idaho Stop in Paris \\"found that allowing the cyclists to move more freely cut down the chances of collisions with cars, including accidents involving the car's blind spot.\\" And, less definitively, a study of rolling stops in Seattle determined that \\"these results support the theoretical assertion that bicyclists are capable of making safe decisions regarding rolling stop,\\"Bicyclists' Stopping Behaviors: An Observational Study of Bicyclists' Patterns and Practices, Catherine Marie Caverly Silva, 2015 while a 2013 survey of stop as yield in Colorado localities where it is legal reported no increase in crashes. Another study done in Chicago showed that compliance with stop signs and stop lights by cyclists was low when cross-traffic was not present, but that most were still performing an Idaho Stop; and therefore \\"enforcing existing rules at these intersections would seem arbitrary and capacious(sic).\\" Some supporters maintain that changing the legal duties of cyclists provides direction to law enforcement to focus attention where it belongs‚Äîon unsafe cyclists (and motorists). Additionally, some claim that, because bicycle laws should be designed to allow cyclists to travel swiftly and easily, the Idaho stop provision allows for the conservation of energy.Why Bicyclists Hate Stop Signs, Joel Fajansan and Melanie Curry, 2001 Opponents of the law maintain that a uniform, unambiguous set of laws that apply to all road users is easier for children to understand and allowing cyclists to behave by a separate set of rules than drivers makes them less predictable and thus, less safe.\\"It.. violates one of the primary elements of traffic safety: predictability.\\" Jack Gillette, former president of the Boise Bicycle Commuters Association, argued that bicyclists should not have greater freedoms than drivers. \\"Bicyclists want the same rights as drivers, and maybe they should have the same duties,\\" he said. as stated by Former rolling stop supporter Jack Gillette, then- President of the Boise Bicycle Commuters Association San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee argued that the law \\"directly endangers pedestrians and cyclists\\" in his veto of a similar law in his city. Examples and legislative history Idaho is both the largest and longest practitioner of the stop-as-yield, and the only practitioner of the red-as-stop. Mark McNeese, Bicycle/Pedestrian Coordinator for the Idaho Transportation Department says that \\"Idaho bicycle- collision statistics confirm that the Idaho law has resulted in no discernible increase in injuries or fatalities to bicyclists.\\" In 2012, a decree in Paris allowed cyclists in that city to turn right or, if there is no street to the right, proceed straight ahead on red, under the condition that they \\"exercise caution\\" and yield to pedestrians, after road safety experts deemed the measure would reduce collisions. During the summer of 2015, Paris law was modified to allow cyclists to treat certain stop lights as yield signs as allowed by signage. The change only applied to right turns or going straight at a T-junction. In parts of Colorado, the stop-as-yield law is in place. In 2011, the cities of Dillon and Breckenridge, Colorado, passed stop-as-yield laws, in 2012 Summit County passed a similar law for its unincorporated areas, and in 2014, the City of Aspen passed one as well. Fort Collins considered the same law in 2013, but declined. In 2018, the state passed a law standardizing the language municipalities or counties could use to pass an Idaho Stop or Stop-as-yield ordinance and preventing it from applying to any state highway system. The act requires the cyclist to go through the intersection at a reasonable speed and sets the reasonable speed limit at 15 mph, but a municipality or county could reduce it to 10 mph or raise it to 20 mph at any individual intersection. The city of Thornton became the first city to legalize the \\"Safety Stop,\\" following the change of law, when they did so in 2019. In 2017, 35 years after Idaho, Delaware became the second U.S. state to pass an Idaho Stop law. Delaware's law - known as the \\"Delaware Yield\\" - makes stop-as-yield legal, but it only applies on roads with one or two travel lanes. Cyclists must come to a complete stop at stop sign-controlled intersections with multi-lane roads. Oregon's \\"Stop as Yield\\" law became effective January 1, 2020. Many states have laws allowing cyclists (and motorcyclists) to stop at and then proceed through a red light if the light doesn't change due to the inability of the embedded sensors in the ground to detect them. Such laws often require that the cyclist stop, confirm that there is no oncoming traffic, and proceed after waiting a certain amount of time or cycles of the light. These are known as \\"Dead Red\\" laws. Since 2003, Idaho stop style bills, or resolutions asking the state to pass one, have been introduced in Oregon, San Francisco, Minnesota, Arizona, Montana, Utah, Washington DC, New York City, Santa Fe, Oklahoma, Edmonton, Colorado, and California, with various levels of success. Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson signed the Arkansas \\"Idaho stop\\" law in April 2019. On August 6, Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed Stop as Yield into law with an effective date of January 1, 2020.

No-self theory  Giles takes Hume's notion of personal identity being a fiction and develops it in terms of Buddhist accounts of no-self and theories of language. Giles points out that many theories of personal identity are reductive theories. They try to reduce the idea of personal identity to elements such as memory, personality, or bodily continutiy. The no-self theory, however, is an illiminative theory. That is, it illiminates the idea of personal identity altogether. He allows that we are sometimes aware of psychological and emotional states that seem to give immediate awareness of self. He argues, however, that what we are aware of at these times is not an persisting self, but rather a \\"constructed or condensed self-image\\", namely \\"a composite of related images and meanings referring to how I see myself at that moment\\".Donald C. Abel, Fifty Readings in Philosophy, fourth edition, New York: McGraw Hill, 2012, p. 244. These moments, however, make only race appearances in consciousness.  Metaphysics of awareness  In a radical interpretation of early Daoist philosophy, Giles argues that the Dao (Tao) has little to do with mysticism or cosmology. Rather, it refers to human awareness. The Daoist accounts of return and non-action, says Giles, provide us with insights into the nature of awareness and how meditative states can co-exist within and thus underpin everyday awareness. This works through what he calls the double return, or a back and forth of stillness and constant flow of awareness. Giles compares this view of awareness with ancient Greek, Buddhist, existentialist, and analytic accounts of philosophy of mind in an \\"extension of the global philosophical palette\\".Robert Cummings Neville, Publisher's website, https://threepinespress.com/2020/07/21/the-way-of- awareness-in-daoist-philosophy/ James Giles, The Way of Awareness in Daoist Philosophy, St. Petersberg, Florida: Three Pines Press, 2020.  Theory of sexual desire  Giles published his theory of sexual desire in The Nature of Sexual Desire in 2008.The Nature of Sexual Desire, Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 2008. Sexologists usually account for sexual desire either in terms of social constructionism or as a biological characteristic essential to reproduction. Giles rejects both these views, and attempts to show by a phenomenological approach that sexual desire is an existential need rooted in the human condition, based on a feeling of incompleteness from the experience of one's own gender as a form of disequilibrium. Although the theory shows similarities to earlier theories such as those of Thomas Nagel on sexual perversion, or of Aristophanes on romantic love in Plato's Symposium,,Giles' core thesis is quite distinct. This is the idea that sexual desire is just the desire for mutual baring and caressing. Baring and caressing are thus the true objects of sexual deisre. Since to be bare is to be vulnerable and to be caressed is to be cared for, baring and caressing are explained as the physical expression vulnerability and care. Vulnerability and care are also features of romantic love, and thus tie it to sexual desire.Robert Scott Stewart, \\"Saying How you Feel: Men and Women on Sexual Arousal and Desire,\\" The International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences, 6.10, 2012, pp. 203-212.  Vulnerability and care theory of love  The vulnerability and care theory of love was put forward by Giles in an article entitled \\"A Theory of Love and Sexual Desire\\" (1994) and later developed in his book The Nature of Sexual Desire (2004). Giles also presents his theory in a TEDx Talk'.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7LdWsGjpDg According to Giles, romantic love is a complex of reciprocal desires for mutual vulernability and care. One desires to be vulnerable before the beloved in order that the beloved may show care. At the same time one desires that the beloved be vulnerable before oneself in order that one may care for her or him. Although vulnerability has often been thought to be an unavoidable and perhaps unwanted consequence of love, Giles sees it as being an essential object of the desires of love. His theory has been discussed by scholars Dr. Ruth, in her textbook Human Sexuality: a Psychosocial Perspective (2002),Ruth Westheimer and Sanford Lopater, Human Sexuality: a Psychosocial Perspective, New York: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2002., Dr. Barbara Keesling, in her book Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal (2005).Barbara Keesling Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal, 2nd edition, Alameda, CA: Hunter House, 2005., and Natasha McKeever in Romantic Love and Monogamy: A Philosophical Exploration (2014), Natasha McKeever, Romantic Love and Monogamy: A Philosophical Exploration. PhD thesis, University of Sheffield, 2014. Natasha McKeever, Love: what's sex got to do with it? International Journal of Applied Philosophy 30 (2): 201-218. 2016.  Sexual attraction  In Sexual Attraction: The Psychology of Allure, Giles claims that the experience of sexual attraction has been ignored by scholars or confused with sexual desire. While sexual desire is an urge that is experienced as coming from within, sexual attraction is felt to have its locus in the attractive person. This experience is comprise of three components:(1) feeling drawn towards the attractive person, much like being drawn by a magnetic quality; (2) a sense of helplessness in being drawn towards the person; and (3) sexual fantasies about erotic interaction with the person. Richard D. Mcanulty, \\"The Heart of Sexual Attraction\\". PsycCritiques, July, 2016 Naked love theory Giles published his \\"naked love theory\\" of human hairlessness in 2010.James Giles (2010). \\"Naked love: The evolution of human hairlessness\\". Biological Theory 5: 326‚Äì336. He postulated that hairlessness in humans evolved as a result of the pleasure of skin-to-skin contact between mother and child, and thus ultimately as a consequence of bipedalism. According to Giles, naked skin is a precondition for the appearance of romantic love.

All 8 people on board the aircraft were killed as a result of the accident. The findings of a subsequent investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau highlighting the airline's operating procedures as a key factor leading to the accident were later overturned after they were contradicted by evidence presented at a Coronial inquiry into the deaths of those on board the flight. The safety implications arising from the accident were subject to a recall by engine manufacturer Textron Lycoming which saw close to 1000 aircraft grounded worldwide while defects were rectified at an estimated cost of $A66 million. Australia's aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority also mandated lifejackets be carried on all aircraft operating over water after the crash. Accident Flight 904 departed Adelaide International Airport at 1823 and climbed to an altitude of before turning to track directly towards Whyalla. Much of the route was flown over the waters of Gulf St Vincent and Spencer Gulf while in darkness, with a short distance crossing the isolated Yorke Peninsula. Approximately 30 minutes later the pilot notified Adelaide Air Traffic Control that he was commencing descent into Whyalla. At 1901, the pilot issued a distress call, advising both engines had failed and he intended to ditch the aircraft if unable to make the destination. Contact with flight 904 was maintained for another three minutes, to a point approximately from Whyalla. Shortly after the final transmission from the aircraft, the crew of another flight nearby detected a signal from an Emergency Locator Transmitter which lasted between 10 and 20 seconds. A search and rescue operation recovered two bodies and debris from the water the following morning. On 6 June, a further five bodies were recovered by police divers from the main wreckage which had been located on the sea floor. The eighth victim was never located. The accident was the first recorded ditching involving a Piper Navajo in Australia, and the deadliest crash involving a scheduled airline since 1980. Aftermath and ATSB investigation The main wreckage of the Piper Navajo was raised from the sea floor on 9 June and found to be relatively intact. During the investigation, aviation regulator CASA grounded the small airline as part of a separate, ongoing audit of its operations, hearing allegations that the airline forced pilots who reported they were fatigued to continue working or face dismissal and that records of duty hours had been falsified. These claims were strongly denied by the company management who insisted they maintained a good safety culture. The grounding resulted in the dismissal of the airline's pilots and disruption to air services throughout the isolated Eyre Peninsula. The company had previously been subject to investigation by the regulator following a 1997 forced landing when one of its aircraft had run low on fuel. An audit had uncovered 119 breaches, and saw the chief pilot's endorsement revoked. However, the airline was able to satisfy the regulator and was permitted to continue operating. On 21 April 2000, just weeks before the accident the original chief pilot was approved by CASA and reinstated in the position, after his replacement quit amid concerns about the company management and safety culture. It was also revealed the accident aircraft had suffered another engine failure in January 2000 while being flown by the same pilot. The engine had been replaced following the incident. The ATSB's report on the accident was released in December 2001. The 150-page document included nine separate safety recommendations, focusing on the apparent relationship between Whyalla Airlines' fuel mixture practices and chemical deposits from accumulating inside pistons and cylinder heads affecting engine reliability. Recommendations were also made with regards to safety and survival equipment carried on small aircraft operated commercially. The report found that the aircraft's left engine first suffered a catastrophic failure after the crankshaft failed as a result of fatigue cracking. It suggested the actions of the pilot in continuing to Whyalla while increasing power on the right engine contributed to it also failing as a result of mishandling and overloading due to extra strain. The report did not attribute a probable cause of the accident. The findings of the report were disputed by many in the aviation industry, in particular the emphasis on lead oxybromide deposits formed as a result of the engines running at high temperatures due to the company's fuel saving policies. The report attributed these deposits as the cause of detonation within the cylinder head which blew a hole in the right engine, although the validity of this finding was disputed outside of the Bureau. Commentators in the United States where the aircraft was manufactured weighed in to the controversy. John Deakin, a highly experienced pilot and writer for US aviation news website AVweb raised further questions. Deakin pointed out that one month after the report was published, engine manufacturer Textron Lycoming notified operators of the same model fitted to flight 904 of a recall to address defective crankshafts, and provided a number of plausible scenarios leading to engine failures which were overlooked by the investigation. With a lack of corroborating evidence other than the ATSB's own research, Deakin labelled the findings as \\"junk science\\". Flying magazine editor Richard Collins disagreed however, describing the report as \\"the most complete accident report on a mechanically related general aviation piston airplane accident\\" he had ever seen. Coronial inquest and second report A Coronial inquest into the deaths of the accident victims and adequacy of the ATSB investigation began in July 2002. South Australian Coroner Wayne Chivell delivered his findings on 24 July 2003, exonerating the pilot overturning the ATSB's conclusions. The conduct of the ATSB during the inquiry was described by the court as \\"uncooperative and defensive\\" after reviewing scientific evidence which contradicted the report, indicating that the initial failure occurred in one of the cylinders in the right engine as a result of overheating that may have been exacerbated by the presence of lead oxybromide deposits. The engine however would have continued operating at a reduced power, affecting the pilot's decision to continue to Whyalla. The Coroner found the failure of the left engine was caused by a metallurgic defect, present in the broken crankshaft since its manufacture, hence the failures were independent of each other. The inquest was critical that the ATSB had not taken into account as many as 15 similar engine failures leading to Textron Lycoming's recall, including two that occurred in Australia after the accident. Just days before the report was released in December 2001, the Bureau was notified of an incident involving a Sharp Airlines Piper Chieftain which suffered a broken crankshaft in one of its engines. Chivell also accused the ATSB of dismissing the possibility of the engines on flight 904 failing independently of one another simply because it was extremely unlikely, and that the original investigation was flawed because it had tried to make the available evidence fit a theory, instead of exploring all possibilities and described the Bureau's attitude to the investigation as arrogant. In response to the Coroner's findings, the ATSB undertook to improve the way in which it interacted with state Coroners during safety investigations, developing a memorandum of understanding to engage with and clarify the aspects of the investigation that the Bureau considered within its scope and encouraging Coroners to share information and liaise with the Bureau on matters they believed should be included in reporting and analysis of accidents. It argued however that while it was not the ATSB's job to attribute blame in an accident, the Coroner's investigation commissioned experts including representatives from a US firm acting on behalf of victims families in a civil litigation case seeking damages from engine manufacturer Textron Lycoming. A supplementary accident investigation was opened in November 2002 to consider new evidence heard before the Coronial inquest. The second report was published in October 2003, acknowledging the Coroner's findings, but maintaining that the sequence of events and contributing factors discussed in the Bureau's original report remained the most likely explanation for the accident. Legacy and safety action As a result of the investigations into the crash of Whyalla Airlines 904, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority accepted and acted upon some of the recommendations made by both the ATSB and the South Australian Coroner. This included immediately mandating that all flights operated within Australia over water with paying passengers on board were to carry life jackets. Previously, this had been only required for aircraft carrying more than nine passengers. Subsequent revisions of the regulations in the aftermath of the accident also went further, requiring emergency beacons, lighting and provisions to be carried on such flights. The investigations also prompted CASA to take action warning pilots and operators of high performance piston engine aircraft about potential dangers of running engines with a leaner than optimal fuel-air mixture.

She is currently Ethiopian Ambassador to Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Biography She was born in Ambo west of Addis Ababa to a family of eight in 1956. Her father, Ejigu Wolde-Mariam, was a military officer so the family moved around Ethiopia a lot. Both her parents did not have much education but they encouraged their children to seek a strong one. She attended several different primary schools. At the Princess Tenagnework Comprehensive High School, an Indian teacher encouraged her interest in science and chemistry. Ejigu enrolled at Addis Ababa University in 1973, where she was assigned to the mathematics department but transferred to the chemistry department in her second year. In the midst of the revolution in 1974, she was sent to the farmland to work alongside peasants. Due to the hardness of the situation in the country at the time, she dropped out of university to work teaching physical science. Later, she found work at the Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Manufacturing as a chemical analyst. After quitting her job in pharmaceuticals, she received a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Addis Ababa University in 1980. Ejigu became a junior geoscience analyst in the laboratory of the Ethiopian Geological Survey. She earned a master's degree in Analytical Chemistry in 1988 at the University of East Anglia. After taking her degree, she joined the Water and Geothermal Analysis Department in the Ministry of Mines and was soon promoted to head of the department, rare for a woman at the time. She became Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Mines and Energy in June 1998. She is a member of the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization and was a member of the House of Peoples' Representatives representing Dendi, Western Shewa, Oromia. She was appointed Minister of Mines in the Cabinet of Ethiopia in 2010. Her main role as minister was to discover the basic geoscience data of Ethiopia, to promote mineral and petroleum exploration, and grant permits to investors seeking to make money in mining. Due to her background in science, she was able to directly manage the scientific projects themselves and not just the personnel of the ministry. Throughout Ethiopia's history the government typically pursued agriculture for development, but it began focusing more on mining when Ejignu was appointed. In 2012, she was involved in a dispute with the Hong Kong-based company PetroTrans after she revoked their license since they were taking too long on a project. In 2014, she became Ethiopian Ambassador to Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Ejignu is also a Director of Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation.

It is native to the western and central Indo-Pacific region and is used for the production of cultured pearls. The generic name comes from Greek œÄœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ (pteron) meaning wing. Distribution and habitat Pteria penguin is native to the western and central Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the East African coast and the Red Sea to India, southern China, southern Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and northern Australia. It is found attached by its byssal threads to a number of different substrates, rocks and corals (especially to Gorgonacea), at intertidal depths of less than .Sealife Base Description Pteria penguin can reach a common shell length of about , with a maximum length of . The shells of this rather large species are solid and ovate. The posterior ear develops a narrow, elongated, wing-like expansion. The left valve is more inflated than the right one. The outside color of the shell ranges from dark brown to black, while the interior is nacreous silvery, a wide non-nacreous glossy black margin Biology As well as most of the species of the class Bivalvia, these wing oysters are gonochoric. Embryos of this species at first develop into a free-swimming planktonic marine larva, then followed by a veliger, quite similar to a small clam. Pearl culture Wild oysters of this species seldom contain pearls. When they do, they tend to be irregular in shape and have the same range of pinkish hues that are typical of the nacre lining the shells. The maximum diameter of the pearls is about . Because the shell valves of this species are so thin, it was beyond the competence of nineteenth century oyster culturists to use it for pearl production. With modern techniques, seeding has become easier and Pteria penguin has joined Pteria sterna, another member of the genus Pteria, as being a major producer of cultured pearls. Most of the pearls produced by Pteria penguin are \\"mab√© pearls\\", also known as bubble or half pearls, formed between the mantle and the shell valve and having one flattened side. The production of round pearls is possible but requires more advanced techniques in seeding. Naturally occurring spat can be collected on spat collectors for growing on into mature oysters, and there are some hatcheries producing spat on a commercial scale. These oysters are cultured on the Ryukyu Islands, along the southern coast of China, on Phuket Island in Thailand and on Vava'u in Tonga.

History  The Chinese people of the Territory came originally from the Kwantang Province of South-east China. They came as worker immigrants in the German regime before 1914.'New Guinea Chinese Not Communist', Newcastle Morning Herald & Miners' Advocate (NSW), 17 June 1950, p. 13, viewed 17 February 2014 After 1930, trade stores were established mostly by the Chinese, that catered for New Guinean needs rather than those of the Europeans.Suzanne Romaine. Language, Education, and Development: Urban and Rural Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea. Oxford University Press; 1992 [retrieved 16 February 2014]. . p. 115. The Chinese presence created a buffer zone between the Europeans and New Guineans and furthermore established Chinatown settlements.Romaine1992  World War II  In October, Captain N. E. Brand of the 10th Field Ambulance and ten ORs ran an evacuation post in Chinatown Lae and on 8 September 1943, six 65th BS B-17s bombed Chinatown, a concentration of buildings and supplies at Lae. Encountering no anti-aircraft fire or enemy fighter opposition, the 65th BS historian wrote: :\\"Bombing was excellent. The mission was uneventful.\\"Gene Eric Salecker. Fortress Against The Sun: The B-17. Da Capo Press; 2001. . p. 365‚Äì. Lyndon B. Johnson was appointed Lieutenant Commander in the United States Naval Reserve on 21 June 1940. Eleven B-26 Marauders of the 22nd Bomb Group departed Townsville on 8 June 1942, arrived in Port Moresby and raided Lae on 9 June 1942. The mission was called \\"TOW 9\\" and Lieutenant Commander Johnson, the future 36th President of the United States, went on this raid as an observer on the aircraft, the Heckling Hare. Nine days after the raid, Lyndon Johnson was awarded a Silver Star medal for his participation in the above bombing raid.  Post-World War II  After the war the Chinese were settled on leased land in Chinatown but in the latter years some have moved out and built modern premises in the lower terrace, in the main commercial area and on the edge of the upper terrace facing the Lae Airfield. In 1963, the Chinatown residential area was scheduled for replacement. According to the Canberra Times: :Chinatown residential area will be replaced, the Morobe District Commissioner, Mr H. Niall, announced. About 600 people live in the area in old shacks and wooden sheds. By the early 1970s the Chinese took advantage of their elevated status as \\"white\\" Australians by engaging in larger-scale commercial businesses. They opened supermarkets and large general stores that catered to local consumers of European descent and Australian tourists. Many also purchased land and operated plantations of coffee, coconut and tea. One successful Chinese merchant in Lae even started a chartered airlines company. Long time businessman and Papua New Guinea citizen, Sir Ling James Seeto claims that the Chinese were first recruited into the country by the Germans to do carpentry work, build boats, plumbing and other menial work. In the 1970s China town was well and truly established and trade stores were everywhere with many Chinese restaurants.***aCe*** (2003),A Wealth of Culture The culture of Papua New Guinea in the timeline-The early beginnings of China town in PNG Papua New Guinea Business & Tourism  Mount Lunaman  At the base of Mount Lunaman at the southern and south- eastern face are the suburbs of Voco Point and Chinatown.

Mount Lunaman is known to the locals as Lo' Wamung, which means \\"first hill\\", Hospital Hill and Fortress Hill by the German settlers. Mount Lunaman and the Lae urban area have been the subject of several tectonic studies relating to plate shift.  Mount Lunaman during World War II  Mount Lunaman was an important landmark for both Japanese and the Allies: :\\"The men of the South Australian battalion hammered and sawed vigorously at the top of the terrace. They were reconstructing, with captured Japanese tools, the skeleton of the cottage formerly used as the Japanese commander's sanctum. A hole beneath the door led by a tunnel to a labyrinth of passages and apertures which honeycombed Mount Lunaman\\". After the war it was believed that Mount Lunaman contained the remains of many Japanese soldiers who defended Lae using tunnels: tunnel in Mt Lunaman. Looking out towards Chinatown. :A Japanese tomb believed to contain bodies of hundreds of Lae defenders was bought by two South Australian men for 1 pound. The tomb lies under Mount Lunaman which is said to house a hospital and when the Japanese in tunnels refused to surrender to the Australian 7th Division and 9th Division troops in 1943 all entrances were sealed. Mount Lunaman and the Lae urban area has been the subject of several tectonic studies relating to plate shift.  Facilities  The Lae Chinese Club is located in Chinatown.
