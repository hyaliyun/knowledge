At the beginning of the game one member of the team would wear a helmet which blocked their vision. That child would then be sent into the labyrinth, a computer-generated maze made by Chromakey technology. The other three teammates acted guides, telling the child in the labyrinth what to do.

The Garrotxa Volcanic Zone Natural Park (Catalan: ') is a natural park area covering a Holocene volcanic field (also known as the Olot volcanic field) in Catalonia, northeastern Spain. The volcanos, of which there are about forty within the park, are no longer active, with the last eruption (Croscat) occurring about 11,000 years ago. However, the region is still seismically active, and a large earthquake in 1428 caused damage to buildings and twenty deaths in Barcelona, to the south. More recent earthquakes in 1901 and 1902 caused shaking but little damage. The park covers 12,093.02 hectares, and includes territory from eleven municipalities in the comarca of Garrotxa.. The built-up areas of Olot, Santa Pau, Sant Joan les Fonts and Castellfollit de la Roca are completely surrounded by the park. Including these urban areas, the population of the park is more than 40,000 people, and the economic development of the zone is one of the objectives of the park management, while trying to avoid the damage caused by quarrying, urban sprawl and illegal waste disposal. Some 980.86 ha of the park, including the best preserved volcanic cones, are fully protected as nature reserves. Geology The Garrotxa field is a monogenetic volcanic field, with each volcano representing a single period of eruption. The field became active about 700,000 years ago,. and is the most recent expression of volcanic activity in northeastern Catalonia, which dates back 10 million years.

Potter referred to himself as Potter Christ. Biography Potter was born in Herkimer County, New York. At age 19, he married Almira Smith. By 1835 Potter had moved with his wife and children to Switzerland County, Indiana. On November 10, 1839, Potter and his family were baptized by missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In April 1840, Potter and his family moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, to join the main gathering of Latter Day Saints. On April 24, 1840, Potter was given the Melchizedek priesthood and ordained to the priesthood office of elder by Joseph Smith. On June 1, 1840, Potter received a patriarchal blessing from church patriarch Joseph Smith Sr. Potter settled in Sand Prairie, Iowa, where he was the presiding elder of the church. In January 1845, Potter became a seventy in the church. In 1848, Potter traveled to the Salt Lake Valley as a Mormon pioneer. By 1856, he had moved from Utah Territory to San Bernardino, California. On March 16, 1856, Potter received a call to serve as a missionary in Australia from LDS Church president Brigham Young. Later that year, Potter left California for Australia on the ship Osprey. Potter later claimed that during his trip to Australia, he underwent a \\"purifying, quickening change\\" whereby his own spiritual body, called \\"Christ\\", entered into his body and he became \\"Potter Christ, Son of the living God\\". During his time in Australia, Potter wrote a book which he said was dictated to him by angels; it was described by Potter as the book from which all people were to be judged at the Final Judgment. Potter returned to California by October 1857. A Latter-day Saint observer described Potter's re-appearance in the community: > Wednesday 21 October 1857‚ÄîArnold Potter, who calls himself Potter Christ, > appeared in our streets today with a brand on his forehead which had been > put in with India ink. The words which can be read at quite a distance, are > \\"Potter Christ‚ÄîThe Living God‚ÄîMorning Star\\". To the right of the inscription > is a star, below a cross. He appears very desirous of winning followers. It > is said there are several apostates about to join him.Manuscript History of > the San Bernardino Settlement, LDS Church archives. By 1861, Potter and some of his followers had left California with the intention of settling near Independence, Missouri, the traditional location of Zion for the Latter Day Saints. They settled at Saint Marys in northwest Mills County, Iowa. When Saint Marys was destroyed by flooding in 1865, they moved to Council Bluffs, Iowa. Potter spent his days wandering the streets in Council Bluffs wearing a long white robe and became a local oddity. Potter's followers in Council Bluffs were described as \\"few but devout\\". The men wore black robes and the women eschewed normal grooming practices. Potter and his followers held enthusiastic prayer meetings which would often culminate in Potter declaring a new revelation from God. In 1872, Potter announced at a meeting of his church that the time had come for his ascent into heaven. Followed by his disciples, Potter rode a donkey to the edge of the bluffs, whereupon he leapt off the edge intending to \\"ascend,\\" but instead fell to his death. His body was collected and buried by his followers.

Bruce Harvey Kiskaddon was born in 1878 in Pennsylvania. He started his cowboy life in 1898 working in the Picket Wire district of Colorado. Kiskaddon worked for ten years as a cowboy. He frequently amused his fellow cowboys by writing parodies of songs and putting into rhyme the happenings around the ranch and on the trail.Coggin At the outbreak of World War I, Kiskaddon joined the Army and served honorably in France with the cavalry. He remained overseas, spending time in the ranches of Australia as a jackaroo. When he returned to the United States, he found employment with Tap Duncan, a well-known and successful cattle rancher.Reynolds Kiskaddon entertained his fellow cowboys with his creative rewriting of popular songs. In 1922, with the encouragement of his employer, he wrote western poems about what life was really like in the west. With Duncan's encouragement, Kiskaddon began writing poetry that was both popular with cowboys and the general reading public. In 1924, he published his first book of poetry. In 1926, Kiskaddon left the cowboy life behind for a career in films. He traveled to Hollywood to audition for a job as an extra in the movie Ben-Hur. He stayed in Hollywood the rest of his life, working as an extra and taking bit parts in Westerns. He supported himself mainly working as a bellhop in Hollywood hotels. He included several of his poems relating to hotel life in his book Just As Is published in 1928. For years, Kiskaddon's poetry appeared in calendars from the Los Angeles Union Stock Yards. He continued to write and consolidate his poetry and reminisces of life on the range in the Western Livestock Journal. He published collections of his poetry in 1928, 1935, and 1947. The Los Angeles Union Stockyards continued to publish his poems and illustrations in calendars through 1959. Bruce Kiskaddon died in 1950. Today, he is remembered and admired by Cowboy Poetry enthusiasts for his authenticity and skill at invoking life in the west as it once was.

Begun in 1878 and originally published in 1886, the novel is known for popularizing the term \\"Android\\". Plot Villiers opens the novel with his main character, a fictionalized Thomas Edison, contemplating the effects of his inventions on the world and the tragedy that they were not available until he invented them. Interrupted in his reverie, Edison receives a message from his friend Lord Ewald, who saved his life some years before and to whom he feels indebted. When Ewald calls, he reveals that he is close to suicide because of his fianc√©e, Miss Alicia Clary. Alicia is described as being physically perfect but emotionally and intellectually empty. She will say whatever she believes others want to hear. Far from having any ambition or goals of her own, she lives her life based on what she believes is expected of her. Ewald describes his frustration with the disparity between her appearance and her self and confides that though he can have no other, she is so hopeless that he has resolved to kill himself. Edison replies by offering to construct for Ewald a machine-woman in the form of Alicia but without any of her bothersome personality. He shows Ewald the prototype of the Android, named Hadaly, and Ewald is intrigued and accepts Edison's offer. Edison reveals that he has invited Alicia to his residence at Menlo Park in order to set the process in motion. He then explains to the still somewhat doubtful Ewald how he will interact with the Android and how natural it will all feel. Ewald then presses Edison to tell him why he created Hadaly in the first place. Edison relates a long story about Mr. Edward Anderson who was tempted into infidelity by a young woman named Miss Evelyn. His indiscretion, brought about by the guile of Miss Evelyn, ruins his life completely. Edison then says that he tracked down Miss Evelyn only to discover that she was not as she appeared, rather she was horribly ugly and her beauty was entirely the work of cosmetics, wigs, and other accessories. Edison created Hadaly in an effort to overcome the flaws and artificiality of real women and create a perfect and natural woman who could bring a man true happiness. Edison then takes Ewald back to Hadaly and explains to him the exact mechanical details of her functioning: how she moves and talks and breathes and bathes, all the while explaining how natural and normal Hadaly's robotic needs are, comparing them to similar human actions and functions. After the details of the android's functioning and construction are covered, Alicia arrives and is escorted in. Edison convinces her that she is being considered for an important theater role. Over the course of the next weeks, she poses for Edison and her exact physical likeness is duplicated and recordings of her voice are made. Eventually, Edison sends Alicia away and introduces Ewald to his artificial Alicia without revealing that it is not the real thing. Ewald is very taken with her and she secretly reveals to him that she is in fact not simply an Android but has been supernaturally endowed with the spirit of Sowana, Edison's mystical assistant. Ewald does not reveal this fact to Edison but instead leaves with Hadaly-Alicia-Sowana. However, before he can reach home to his new life with his new lover, Ewald's ship sinks and the Android, who was traveling with the cargo, is destroyed.

He served as Chief-Commissioner of the Central Provinces and Berar from 1898 to 1899 and Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab in 1907.  Early life  Denzil Ibbetson was born in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire on 30 August 1847, the oldest son of Denzil John Holt Ibbetson (1823 ‚Äì 10 August 1871), who was at that time working as a civil engineer on the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. The family moved to Adelaide, Australia after his father took holy orders and became a vicar there, notably of St John's Church, Adelaide 1861‚Äì1871. Ibbetson was educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide and St John's College, Cambridge. Ibbetson obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1869, being ranked as a senior optime. He had come third in the competitive examination for the Indian Civil Service in the previous year.  Career in India  Ibbetson arrived in the Punjab Province of India on 8 December 1870, having married Louisa Clarissa Coulden earlier in that year. Once there, says the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, \\"He formed part of a new √©lite of ‚Äòcompetition-wallahs‚Äô which intellectually outshone the earlier generation of Punjabi military political officials and well-connected alumni of Haileybury College.\\"India List (1905), p. 528. He held various administrative offices. From 1898 to around 1900 he was Chief-Commissioner of the Central Provinces and Berar, at which time he had to return temporarily to England due to poor health. In September 1901 he was appointed a Member of the Council of the Governor-General of India. He served temporarily as Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab in 1905 and took over the position permanently in March 1907 when Sir Charles Montgomery Rivaz retired. Dogged by further ill health that had necessitated another period in England, Ibbetson retired on 21 January 1908 and left India. He died on 21 February at his home at 60 Montague Mansions, York Street, London. He was cremated at Golders Green and survived by his wife.  Contribution to India census and view on castes  The censuses of India carried out in 1865, 1872 and 1881 had attempted to classify people according to the Brahmanic ritual ranking system of varna but this proved not to reflect the realities of social relationships, however much it might have met with approval from scholars of Sanskrit and ancient texts. Furthermore, the Brahmanic system had no practical purpose from an administrative point of view.Bates (1995), p. 228. The latter was of considerable significance as there was a desire to use ethnography and other means in order to develop further the British influence in India. Ibbetson, who was Deputy Superintendent for the 1881 census operation in Punjab, had written in his 1883 Report on the exercise that The 1872 census was, in the opinion of Crispin Bates, Ibbetson had seen the imperfections of the 1872 census. These informed the decision by the administration in Punjab Province to adopt categorisation by occupation in 1881, regardless of the approach adopted elsewhere. Together with John Collinson Nesfield's Brief view of the caste system of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, published in 1885, Ibbetson's 1883 Report was influential in bringing about a change in categorisation method throughout the country. Ibbetson argued against the contemporary understanding of caste and the 1891 census adopted classification by occupation rather than the Brahmanic system. He argued that the conventional belief of caste as a purely Hindu construct was erroneous, that people who had converted from Hinduism to Islam remained affected by system, and that therefore it should be viewed more as a social than a religious mechanism. Furthermore, he believed that the varna categories of Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra were not reflected in reality, and that indeed it was likely that Kshatriya no longer existed and Vaishya certainly did not. He pointed out that there were Brahmins who were viewed as being outcastes even by the lowest ritual rank, the Shudra, and that the latter term was primarily used as a form of abuse rather than in any categorical sense. Finally, he argued that the contemporary belief that caste and the ritual ranks associated with it were inherited had no basis in fact, that different generations could have different identities and that the ancient basis of castes probably lay in shared origins of a tribal nature and were akin to guilds. Despite their influence on the processes adopted for the 1891 census, the ideas of Ibbetson and Nesfield subsequently lost favour in the administration of the British Raj. Bates says that The anecdotal evidence of a racial basis for caste, which could be traced back to the late-18th century speculations of William Jones,Bates (1995), p. 231. was being buttressed by the relatively new field of study known as anthropometry and this gave rise to a form of scientific racism epitomised by the work of people such as Herbert Hope Risley, who became Census Commissioner for India in 1901. Bates remarks that Ibbetson's \\"classification of castes, however logical and useful it might have proven, lacked a 'scientific' basis, as well as completely neglecting the problem of status.\\" In the longer term, however, Ibbetson's theories have attracted support from John Henry Hutton and Edmund Leach and have been \\"cherished by successive generations of non-Marxist, non-Dumontian historians and anthropologists working in the classical British tradition of structural- functionalism, first established by Radcliffe Brown.\\"Bates (1995), p. 229. His written works include A Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province. Based on the census report for the Punjab, 1883 with Horace Arthur Rose and Sir Edward Maclagan, and Panjab castes, being a reprint of the chapter on \\"The races, castes, and tribes of the people\\" in the report on the census of the Panjab. The latter was a posthumous reprint of a section of his 1883 report on the 1881 census of the Punjab.

College career  Holmes attended Mississippi Valley State University and played eight games in his senior season with the Delta Devils. He was named SWAC all-Conference and SWAC all-American Player of the Year. He had 1,167 yards on 189 carries and finished the year with 10 touchdowns. He led the team in scoring for the season with 60 points and he played on special teams. In 2014, Holmes was inducted into the Mississippi Valley State Hall of Fame.  CFL career  Holmes was signed out of college in June 2001 by the Saskatchewan Roughriders and made one appearance in his rookie season, in week 5. He got one carry for three yards, two kickoff returns for 48 yards and four punt returns for 42 yards. He spent the remainder of the season dressed as a backup or on the practice roster. 2002 was a breakthrough year for Holmes as he led the team with seven touchdowns, 1,035 kickoff return yards and 1,023 punt return yards. He was also named a Western Division all-star, CFL Special Teams Player-of-the Year and MVP of the Roughriders as voted on by the players. Holmes played in only 10 games in an injury plagued 2003 season. Despite the injury plagued season he was still nominated for the Most Outstanding Special Teams Player and he was healthy for the play-offs. 2004 was a healthy and productive season for Holmes. He dressed in all 18 regular season games and both play-off games. He finished the season with 635 rushing yards, 536 receiving yards and led the league with 2,704 combined yards. He was up for the Most Outstanding Teams Player for the third straight year. He was named Special Teams Player-of-the-Week in week 17. 2005 was Corey Holmes best season in his CFL career. He started the season off on a good note, scoring on the opening kick-off. Holmes Set a Rider record and was third all- time in the CFL for combined yards with 3,455, he was named the CFL's Special Teams Player of the week four times, was named the CFL's Most Outstanding Special Teams Player, was the Western nominee for Most Outstanding Player, was a CFL all-star, was nominated for the Tom Pate award as voted on by his teammates and he was the Riders Most Popular Player as voted on by the fans.

Holmes dressed in only 10 games for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. 2007 was his seventh season in the CFL. He was traded back to the Riders, along with Chris Getzlaf, for Wide Receiver Jason Armstead in August. He was subsequently released by the Riders on January 29, 2008, a transaction that was not well received by Roughrider fans due to his immense popularity. Saskatchewan released Corey Holmes largely because they were over the salary cap, and that Corey was a casualty of that situation. Corey stated in the Regina Leader Post that he was earning $165,000 per year and that he was due a $30,000 bonus immediately. By releasing Corey, Saskatchewan evaded paying the bonus. Corey further stated that \\"It's time for me to start planning for the future. We'll see if Saskatchewan hires a new coach who wants me. If not, I'll let the day go by and I'll keep talking to God. I can't let one rock get in my way. If I'm not playing anymore, it means I'll get into coaching. I really want to coach.

It was the site of conflict between Japanese and the Allied forces during World War II, and was major airbase for both sides. Geography The island is located on the northern side of large Cenderawasih Bay (formerly Geelvink Bay) of New Guinea island. Approximately oval shaped, it has an area of . It is mostly surrounded by coral reefs, with the exception of some points on the southeastern coast. Also found on the southeastern coast are low, steep cliffs. Most of the interior is composed of forest. The island is jurisdictionally within the Biak Numfor Regency of Papua province. It has a population of 9,336 people in 2010 census covering 5 districts. History The first sighting by Europeans was by the Spanish navigator √Ålvaro de Saavedra on 24 June 1528 when he was trying to return from Tidore to New Spain. Another sighting was later reported in 1545 by Spanish navigator √ç√±igo Ortiz de Retes on board of galleon San Juan when also attempting the return to New Spain Coello, Francisco \\"Notas sobre los planos de las bahias descubiertas, en el a√±o 1606, en las islas de Esp√≠ritu Santo y de Nueva Guinea, que dibujo el capit√°n don Diego de Prado y Tovar, en igual fecha\\" Bolet√≠n de la Sociedad Geogr√°fica de Madrid, t IV, primer semestre de 1878, p.234. World War II During World War II, Numfor was occupied by Japanese military forces in December 1943. The indigenous population at the time numbered about 5,000 people, most of whom lived a subsistence lifestyle in coastal villages. The island was also hosting about 1,100 laborers taken to Numfor by the Japanese: 600 members of a Formosan (Taiwanese) auxiliary labor unit and 500 Indonesian civilian forced laborers. These were the survivors of more than 4,000 laborers taken to Numfor by the Japanese. The Japanese built three airfields on the island, turning it into a significant air base. *Kornasoren Airfield/Yebrurro Airfield, located toward the northern end of the island *Kameri Airfield, on the northwestern edge of the island *Namber Airfield, on the west coast of the island. Bombing of the island by United States and Australian aircraft began as early as April 1944. Allied units landed on the island, from July 2, 1944. Although the island is surrounded by \\"an almost solid ring\\" of coral, newspapers reported \\"almost no loss\\" of troops in reaching the shore. Troops initially landed around Kamiri Airfield on the northwest edge of the island. Although there were extensive Japanese defensive preparations in the Kamiri area, there was little resistance at Kamiri Airfield. In the words of the US Navy official history: \\"Japanese encountered around the airfield were so stunned from the effects of the bombardment that all the fight was taken out of them.\\" The following day, as a precaution against Japanese resistance elsewhere, 2,000 US paratroopers from the 503 Parachute Infantry Regiment were dropped onto the island. The second base captured by US forces, Yebrurro Airfield, was secured by 4 July 1944. On July 5, there was an unsuccessful Japanese counter-attack. That same day, a detachment of US forces from Numfor also secured the smaller neighboring island of Manim. Namber Airfield came under Allied control, without resistance, on July 6. The island was officially declared secure on July 7. However, individual Japanese soldiers continued guerrilla activities, and it was August 31 before all fighting had ceased. By August 31, the Allies had lost 66 killed or missing and 343 wounded. It had killed approximately 1,714 Japanese and taken 186 prisoners. According to the US Army official history, only 403 of the original 3,000 Javanese civilian laborers were alive by August 31. About 10-15 were reported to have been killed accidentally by Allied forces. The rest had died from maltreatment before the invasion. About 300 Formosan labor troops had died before the invasion. Others fought the Allies, allegedly as a result of Japanese coercion. Over 550 surrendered; more than half of these were suffering from starvation and tropical diseases. Less than 20 were reported killed by Allied action. According to the US Army historian, Allied personnel found evidence that human bodies, of Japanese, Formosan and Allied personnel, had been partly eaten by starving Japanese and Formosans. The air base was used in a series of five air raids on the oil refineries of Japanese occupied Balikpapan which were supplying up to 35% of Japan's refined petroleum products. Balikpapan only came within extreme range of the B-24 Liberator bombers of the 13th and 5th US Air Forces. The first air raid on September 30th, 1944 was led by Colonel Thomas Cebern Musgrave Jr. A second raid occurred three days later. Without fighter cover, the first two raids suffered sever losses. Three more raids in October were escorted by P-38 Lightning and P-47 Thunderbolt fighters flying from new bases at Morotai and Sansapor.

The ATMS view is a top-down management perspective that integrates technology primarily to improve the flow of vehicle traffic and improve safety. Real-time traffic data from cameras, speed sensors, etc. flows into a Transportation Management Center (TMC) where it is integrated and processed (e.g. for incident detection), and may result in actions taken (e.g. traffic routing, DMS messages) with the goal of improving traffic flow. The National ITS Architecture defines the following primary goals and metrics for ITS: * Increase transportation system efficiency, * Enhance mobility, * Improve safety, * Reduce fuel consumption and environmental cost, * Increase economic productivity, and * Create an environment for an ITS market. ATMS History In 1956, the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act initiated a 35-year $114 billion program that designed and constructed the Interstate highway system. This hugely successful program was mostly complete by 1991, and the era of build-out was over. In the mid to late 1980s transportation officials from Federal and State governments, the private sector, and universities began a series of informal meetings discussing the future of transportation. This included meetings held by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) in October 1986 to discuss technology applied to future advanced highways. In June 1988 in Washington, DC, the group formalized its structure and chose the name Mobility 2000. In 1990, Mobility 2000 morphed into ITS America, the main ITS advocacy and policy group in the US. The initial name of ITS America was IVHS America and was changed in 1994 to reflect a broader intermodal perspective. The 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) was the first post-build-out transportation act. It initiated a new approach focused on efficiency, intelligence, and intermodalism. It had a primary goal of providing ‚Äúthe foundation for the nation to compete in the global economy‚Äù. This new mixture of infrastructure and technology was identified as an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and was the centerpiece of the 1991 ISTEA act. ITS is loosely defined as ‚Äúthe application of computers, communications, and sensor technology to surface transportation‚Äù. Subsequent surface transportation bills have continued ITS funding and development. In 2005 the SAFETEA-LU (Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users) surface transportation spending bill was signed into law.

Since 2004 he has written around 200 episodes of Coronation Street, including landmark episodes such as Deirdre Barlow's funeral and the aftermath of the 50th anniversary's live tram crash. He has also written several episodes of ITV's Britannia High, and wrote the Coronation Street stage musical 'Street of Dreams' which opened in May 2012. Rochefort starred in and was executive producer of 'Corrie Goes To Kenya' on ITV 1 in August 2012, a documentary series in which Rochefort took four members of the Corrie cast to Mombasa to work with SAFE, a Kenyan- based charity which Rochefort is attached to, spreading HIV awareness through drama. Rochefort is also script consultant on BBC 4's award-winning comedy 'Getting On' starring Jo Brand, Vicky Pepperdine and Jo Scanlan, as well as the more recent 'Puppy Love' also starring Scanlan and Pepperdine. In the 1990s, Rochefort also wrote and presented his own chat show for BBC Wales, the BAFTA Cymru-nominated Damon Rochefort Tonight. He lives in London and Somerset.

Finished in 1814, the Blockhouse is the second oldest structure in the park, after Cleopatra's Needle, and the oldest surviving structure originally built within the park site. It is located on an overlook of Manhattan schist, with a clear view of the flat surrounding areas north of Central Park. The fort was part of a series of fortifications in northern Manhattan, which originally also included three fortifications in Harlem Heights (now Morningside Heights). It was accompanied by Blockhouses No. 2, 3, and 4 in Morningside Park. The fort is the last remaining fortification from these defenses. Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the designers of Central Park, treated Blockhouse No. 1 as a picturesque ruin, romantically overrun with vines and Alpine shrubbery. Construction The Blockhouse was likely built on a foundation of a structure dating back to a much earlier date. In 1776, during the Revolutionary War, British and Hessian troops sealed off lower Manhattan from colonial armies by controlling the pass and defending it through a series of fortifications. From trial excavations performed in 1995, it has been determined that the foundations of Blockhouse No. 1 date back to this time of British occupation of Manhattan. The current fort was constructed in three phases. In the first phase, under the direction of General Joseph Gardner Swift, the fort was hastily constructed by New Yorkers during the War of 1812 in anticipation of a British invasion. The building was assembled by volunteers who brought the building materials with them, hence the red sandstone blocks included with the Manhattan schist. The fort consists of a two-story bunker surrounding a small area, inside which a wooden platform would have originally stood. The wooden platform was sunken with a revolving turret for a cannon. The sides held small gunports. This structure was likely connected to the ground by a small staircase. Construction on the tower was completed December 22, 1814, two days before the Treaty of Ghent was signed to end the war. The second phase was during its use as an ammunition and storage building. During this time the top two feet of stone-work were added. They are noticeably different in color, composition, and stonework. Later at the turn of the 20th century, the current entrance and staircase were added, as was the tall flagpole in the center of the fort. It was described in 1905 as standing tall at the western wall and having a base square. Location Blockhouse No. 1 stands in North Woods at the northwest corner of Central Park, at a location that is still rugged, high, and hard to reach. It is located south of North Drive and north of the Huddlestone Arch. The building overlooks Harlem Meer and the Lasker Rink to the east. Uses This structure was initially built as a defensive fort for New York City and soldiers were stationed at the Blockhouse. At its height, nearly 2,000 New York state militiamen garrisoned the fortifications. However, the British did not attack New York City, and as such the Blockhouse never saw combat. The Treaty of Ghent was signed on Christmas Eve 1814, and the fort was abandoned shortly thereafter.\\"The Blockhouse and the Bench\\" Forgotten New York (March 12, 2001)( It was subsequently used for ammunition storage. In the early 20th century it was used as a place to celebrate patriotic holidays. The structure is currently unoccupied and unused. A large metal gate covers the door. Occasional tours are provided by the Urban Park Rangers, but independent exploration of the interior is not allowed. Lost plaque full map here) The Blockhouse had a bronze tablet commemorating its history placed above the door, placed on June 10, 1905. The ceremony was performed by Mary Van Buren Vanderpoel, president of the Women's Auxiliary to the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. Receiving the plaque was General Frederick Dent Grant. The plaque was stolen from its location and was noticed to be missing on March 28, 1913. The plaque was documented in a copyrighted picture and was located above the door. The plaque read \\"This blockhouse was part of a line of fortifications extending from the Hudson to the Harlem River built for the defense of New York by patriotic citizens during the war of 1812-1815. This tablet is erected by the Women's Auxiliary to the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society A.D. 1905\\". In 1999, the Blockhouse had a new sign erected, describing its history.

It is bounded by Temescal Creek to the north, State Route 24 to the east, Interstate 580 to the south, and Adeline Street to the west.  Geography and Education  The area that is today known as the Longfellow was originally considered part of the Temescal district.Norman, Jeff (2006). Temescal Legacies: Narratives of Change from a North Oakland Neighborhood. Oakland, CA: Shared Ground. . Through the late 1800s, the Temescal encompassed the area north of 36th Street to the Berkeley border and from the Emeryville border at the west to Broadway at the east. The introduction of the Grove- Shafter Freeway in the 1960s physically divided the neighborhood resulting in a splintering of the historical Temescal districtNorman, Jeff (2006). Temescal Legacies: Narratives of Change from a North Oakland Neighborhood. Oakland, CA: Shared Ground. . into smaller neighborhoods: Santa Fe (northwest quadrant), Longfellow (southwest), Temescal (southeast) and lower Rockridge (northeast). Temescal Community Garden Evidence of the roots of the name Temescal remain in the Longfellow neighborhood. Temescal Community Garden, the first community garden in Oakland, was established on 47th Street in 1984 http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/opr/s/cgardening/OAK031398 and falls within Longfellow‚Äôs borders. Temescal Creek, now culverted, runs beneath the rear property line of the garden and ostensibly acts as the physical geography that defines the northern edge of the Longfellow neighborhood. The name Longfellow was introduced to the neighborhood with the opening of the Longfellow Elementary School on Lusk Street between 39th and Apgar streets.http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/sd/details.asp?cds=01612596002034&Public;=Y It is assumed that the school is named after the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In 1982, Nancy Reagan visited the school as part of a national tour to warn children about the dangers of illegal drug use. When one fourth- grader at the school asked Mrs. Reagan what she should do if approached by someone offering drugs, Reagan responded: \\"Just say no\\" and thus the moniker for the national campaign was born.Nancy Reagan in Perspective By Pierre-Marie Loizeau pgs 104-105 , The Longfellow Elementary School closed in 2004, and the property is now used by the Oakland Military Institute, a college preparatory school that relocated to the site in 2007. Other schools in the neighborhood include North Oakland Community Charter School (NOCCS)http://www.noccs.org/ and St Martin De Porres Catholic Schoolhttp://stmdp.org/. The Oakland Public School that served the Longfellow neighborhood, Santa Fe Elementary, closed in 2012,https://oaklandnorth.net/2014/11/19/neighborhood-group-fights-to-re-open- oaklands-santa-fe-elementary/ and neighborhood elementary students are now assigned to Emerson Elementary School in the Temescal neighborhood. Santa Fe Elementary had also served the Santa Fe neighborhood to the north, and elementary students in Santa Fe are now assigned to Sankofa Academy in the Bushrod neighborhood.  Cultural History  Through the early 1900s, North Oakland was a vibrant Italian neighborhoodhttps://oaklandnorth.net/2012/02/20/ill-see-you-down-at-the-club/ including what is now known as the Longfellow district. Grove Street, renamed Martin Lurther King Jr. Way in 1984,http://mshhig.com/transportation.php was an active commercial strip including many Italian businesses. Sacred Heart Parish on the corner of MLK and 40th Street was founded in 1876 and a cornerstone of the larger Italian neighborhood. The Grove Street corridor was also home to the Grove Street #5, a streetcar connecting the community to the greater Key System (Key Route). (The Key System‚Äôs F line connected Berkeley to the Bay Bridge and ran down Linden Street in the Longfellow neighborhood.)http://mshhig.com/transportation.php Caf√© Dej√©na The introduction of the freeway in the 1960shttp://cahighways.org/466-740.html#580 divided the neighborhood and both the commercial district along Grove Street and the Sacred Heart Parish suffered as the area fell into decline. Today, this commercial corridor has been revitalized with the introduction of several thriving food related business including Grace Street Catering, Caf√© Dej√©na, MLK Caf√©, and Arthur Mac's Tap and Snack. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Longfellow and Santa Fe neighborhoods of North Oakland began to transition from a white immigrant populationhttps://oaklandnorth.net/2012/02/20/ill-see- you-down-at-the-club/ of predominantly Italians to an African American population. Two significant African American organizations, the African American Museum and Library (AAMLO) and the Black Panther Party, began in part in the Longfellow neighborhood. The AAMLO's predecessor, the East Bay Negro Historical Society, was founded in 1965 by residents of the Longfellow and greater North Oakland. The society first held meetings at the Church of the Good Shepard, which still stands at 52nd and West streets. The society‚Äôs library-museum contained documentation of \\"the history and accomplishments of black Americans ‚Äì politicians, educators, religious figures, inventors, cowboys and miners who came to California during the Gold Rush\\" and was open to anyone, including school groups, that were interested in the contributions of African Americans to the American experience. The society moved to a storefront on Grove Street (MLK) at 37th Street in 1970, and later in 1976 to another storefront on Grove Street (MLK) just above 45th Street. The organization moved out of the neighborhood in the 1980s and currently resides on 14th Street. The Black Panther Party, an African American leftist organization, also finds its roots in the streets of North Oakland\\"A Lonely Rage: The Autobiography of Bobby Seale,\\"http://creosotejournal.com/2011/07/black-panthers-guide-to-oakland/ including the Longfellow neighborhood. Founders Huey P. Newton and David Hilliard grew up on 47th Street and West Street respectively,http://museumca.org/black-panther-party-landmarks and the Second Black Panther Party Office was located on the 4400 block of Martin Luther King Jr. Way.  Longfellow Today  Birdland Jazzista Social Club The neighborhood has an active community group, which formed in 2010,http://oaklandnorth.net/tag/longfellow-community-association/ known as the Longfellow Community Association.

Gosford Forest Park, previously Gosford Demesne, was acquired by the Department of Agriculture in 1958 and comprises some 240 hectares of diverse woodland and open parkland. Gosford Forest Park is also home to Gosford Castle. It was designated the first conservation forest in Northern Ireland in 1986. Facilities Facilities available include: * Camping and Caravanning Site (with mains electricity) * Picnic and Barbecue areas * Tea House and Shop * Way-marked Trails * Horse-riding routes * Orienteering routes * Disabled facilities * Bookable Guided Tours * Special events (arranged by permit) * Function Hall History In the early 17th century the Acheson family came to the Markethill area, and built a very substantial farmhouse near the present town of Markethill. The family came from Monmouthshire and, in fact, the present Earl of Weymes is related to the Achesons who later became the Earls of Gosford. When they came here first they brought with them 13 families, and some of the family names still survive in the area, notably Galbraith, Greer, etc. One of the two forts (or raths) in Gosford Forest was named after the Greer family who farmed the land in that area. The first dwelling place of the Achesons was burned down; this house was near the town of Markethill which the family were responsible for founding. In 1610 the family were granted the lands of the present estate. They proceeded to build another house using locally procured, hand-made, red brick. This house was named Clonkearney Manor after the townland in which it was built. The path to this site is up near the ponds, but unfortunately only a portion of the red brick foundations is now visible. This house was reputed to have been burned down during the Williamite wars in the mid-17th century. The estate is now owned by the Forest Service and boasts excellent facilities and a cafe. It also houses one of Northern Ireland's premier collections of rare breeds. Gosford Castle has just been renovated into 23 new homes which are currently being sold.

It was formerly used in Wyamine nasal decongestant inhalers and before that as a stimulant in psychiatry. It has been used as a treatment for low blood pressure. ATC Classification: C01CA11 - mephentermine ; Belongs to the class of adrenergic and dopaminergic cardiac stimulants excluding glycosides. Used in the treatment of heart failure. Mechanism of action Mephentermine appears to act by indirect stimulation of Œ≤-adrenergic receptors causing the release of norepinephrine from its storage sites. It has a positive inotropic effect on the myocardium. AV conduction and refractory period of AV node is shortened with an increase in ventricular conduction velocity. It dilates arteries and arterioles in the skeletal muscle and mesenteric vascular beds, leading to an increase in venous return. Its onset is 5 to‚Äì15 minutes with intramuscular dosing, and immediate with intravenous dosing. Its duration of action is four hours with intramuscular dosing and 30 minutes with intravenous dosing. Indication and dosage For maintenance of blood pressure in hypotensive states, the dose for adults is 30‚Äì45 mg as a single dose, repeated as necessary or followed by intravenous infusion of 0.1% mephentermine in 5% dextrose, with the rate and duration of administration depending on the patient's response. For hypotension secondary to spinal anaesthesia in obstetric patients, the dose for adults is 15 mg as a single dose, repeated if needed. The maximum dose 30 mg. Caution=Contraindications Low blood pressure caused by phenothiazines, hypertension, and pheochromocytoma. Special Precautions Patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors. For shock due to loss of blood or fluid, give fluid replacement therapy primarily, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, chronic illnesses, lactation, pregnancy, skin dryness. headache. Adverse Drug Reactions The most common side effects are drowsiness, incoherence, hallucinations, convulsions, slow heart rate (reflex bradycardia). Fear, anxiety, restlessness, tremor, insomnia, confusion, irritability, and psychosis. Nausea, vomiting, reduced appetite, urinary retention, dyspnea, weakness. Potentially fatal reactions are due to atrioventricular block, central nervous system stimulation, cerebral hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, and ventricular arrhythmias. Drug Interactions Mephentermine antagonizes effect of agents that lower blood pressure. Severe hypertension may occur with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and possibly tricyclic antidepressants. Additive vasoconstricting effects occur with ergot alkaloids, and oxytocin. Potentially fatal drug interactions are the risk of abnormal heart rhythm in people undergoing anesthesia with cyclopropane and halothane.

Intravenous etilefrine increases the pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure of healthy individuals. Peripheral vascular resistance falls during the infusion of 1‚Äì8 mg etilefrine but begins to rise at higher dosage. Marked falls in pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and peripheral bloodflow, accompanied by rises in mean arterial pressure, occur when etilefrine is infused after administration of intravenous propranolol 2,5 mg.

It could be like an extra-curricular activity; summer camps and it often is known like a place where children can do weekly activities for two or three hours every weekend. Children and teens can do activities that where energized by a monitor, the person who works in a group like a referent. With all the variety of activities that they make, children and teens can achieve some values, norms and attitudes created by the monitor and shaped in a plan of the group and the entity. All these activities can change they habitual place because it was chosen thinking about the activity. Activities that they can do are like: \\\\- Game.

Educacional IdeasText en cursiva Every entity has the ideals, where they expose the objectives, the values and everything that it's considered important to work in. They picked up everything in a PEC (Educational project of the center/ Projecte educatiu del centre). They analyze the environment, the social surrounding and long and short objectives. A part of this entity ideals, they make different objectives for every group of ages and they work with the items that they want to achieve. They work with the families too. All the activities have to be adapted to every age and it's better to work with something that is important for them or something that they want to know. History The Esplais were born in 1876 with the organization Appenzell (Swiss). Then, they were recognized in 1960. Overview In 2006, the Esplais had over 35,000 members in Catalonia, where the Scout Movement exists as well. Esplac, also known as Esplais Catalans is a full member of the International Falcon Movement - Socialist Education International and has a presidium member for the Europe Region along with their sister organisation in the UK Woodcraft Folk. Esplais have less of a hierarchical structure than the Scouts, but they work in a similar way. They play games, do arts and crafts, have discussions and go on trips. There is a pedagogical aim behind it which promotes the integral development of the child. Typically, an Esplai centre can have about 100 children and 10 educators.

Monatte has been considered one of the great figures of revolutionary syndicalism. Life Monatte was born on 15 January 1881. Alphonse Merrheim arrived in Paris in 1904, and soon afterward, he met Monatte at the office of Pages Libres. The two men would work together to launch La Vie Ouvri√®re (The Worker's Life). In 1914 Monatte and Alfred Rosmer led the internationalist core of La Vie ouvri√®re (The Worker's Life). Monatte often referred himself to Fernand Pelloutier and did not disguise his anarchist sympathies although he drifted away from that current of socialism after the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam in 1907. There, Monatte argued in particular with Errico Malatesta concerning the methods of organisation. Invoking the 1906 Charter of Amiens, which established the principle of \\"political neutrality\\" of trade unions, Monatte considered syndicalism itself to be revolutionary, but Malatesta advocated the creation of some sort of anarchist organisation to superate internal conflicts among the workers' movement itself.Monatte and Malatesta's speech during the 1907 Congress Monatte was the first secretary general of the Comit√©s syndicalistes r√©volutionnaires (Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees). At the CGT's first postwar congress, held in Lyon from 15 to 21 September 1919, Monatte was among the leaders of the minority, with Joseph Tommasi, Raymond P√©ricat and Gaston Monmousseau and denounced the CGT membership in the Amsterdam International of Labor Unions. They claimed that the CGT majority had broken with the principles of syndicalism and lost faith in revolution by dealing with the government. The minority wanted the CGT to join the Communist International. In 1923, Monatte joined the French Communist Party (PCF) and was close to Boris Souvarine and Alfred Rosmer. Along with them, he was excluded at the end of 1924 of the party at the occasion of an internal purge against Left Opposition of the party, which supported Leo Trotsky. Then, Monatte founded in January 1925 the journal La R√©volution prol√©tarienne (The Proletarian Revolution), along with Robert Louzon. The journal enjoyed an appreciated audience among trade unionists and left-wing activists during the interwar period.

He started mountain biking in 1996 and became a professional in 2002. Bryn's first introduction to the sport was through his local mountain bike club in Townsville- The Townsville Rockwheelers. Competing in several cross country type events, Bryn evolved with the sport and later found downhill. As a teenager, he moved north to Cairns, a popular location for downhill mountain biking, and host of the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in 1996. Glen Jacobs was the course builder for that event and several other events on the World Cup, and mentored Bryn and several other downhillers in the area. The first Australian competitors to travel overseas and race world cups with success were Michael Ronning, Scott Sharples, Sean Mccarroll, Tai Lee Muxlow, Katrina Miller, Wade Boots, etc.. Scott Sharples would later become Bryn's coach. Royal/ Orange was the first international Downhill team Bryn raced for in 2002. In 2003, as a member of yet another Aussie Invasion, he joined Rennie, Hill and Graves on the MadCatz/Iron Horse team and started scaring people worldwide with his raw- power cornering and flat-out speed. In 2005 Bryn signed with GT Bicycles for four years. In 2009 he and his girlfriend (now Wife), Jill Kintner formed a privateer program with Crankbrothers and Intense Bicycles. In 2010-11 he rode for Transition Bicycles out of Ferndale, Wa, and is teammates with Jill Kintner, and Lars Sternberg. Since retiring from full-time racing, Bryn has maintained his superhuman bike handling skills, but added pro-level filming and photography to his toolkit, leveraging the power of the internet and social media to stay visible while doing what he loves.

In August 1868, Little Rock was interviewed at Fort Lyon by Indian agent Edward W. Wynkoop about raids by a large Cheyenne war party on white settlements along the Saline and Solomon in Kansas. Little Rock gave Wynkoop information about those responsible for the raids, which included members of several different Cheyenne bands including that of Black Kettle, and agreed to try to persuade the other Cheyenne chiefs and headmen to surrender the raids' leaders to U.S. authorities, in accordance with the terms of the Medicine Lodge Treaty.

With Black Kettle, Little Rock attended a conference at Fort Cobb, Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) with Maj. Gen. William B. Hazen on November 20, 1868, at which Black Kettle sought but was refused permission to come in to Fort Cobb in order to avoid war with the U.S. Army. A week later, in the Battle of Washita River of November 27, 1868, Black Kettle's and Little Rock's camp on the Washita River was attacked at dawn by the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment under the command of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. Little Rock, whose lodge was at the eastern edge of the village, joined with the Cheyenne warrior She Wolf and a visiting Kiowa warrior Trails the Enemy to form a rear guard to protect women and children fleeing downriver from attacking cavalrymen, believed to have been a detachment under Maj. Joel H. Elliott. Little Rock was killed in the action. He was survived by his wife Skunk Woman, his daughter Mo-nah-se-tah (or Me-o- tzi, Spring Grass), his mother, his sister White Buffalo Woman, and another sister. Of these, his mother and his daughter Mo-nah-se-tah were among the 53 women and children taken captive by the 7th Cavalry. NotesReferences * Custer, George Armstrong. (1874).

The equipment is mainly used for the lower back, but can also target the gluteal muscles, hamstring and abdominals. The definition of the equipment, and what 'Roman chair exercise' specifically means, is not clear. Exercises Various exercises have been called \\"Roman chair.\\" The most common or earliest historical meaning for the movement is not clear. Bodyweight can provide significant resistance in all variations, and additional weight can be added to increase difficulty. Mainly two actions are followed while exercising with a \\"Roman chair\\"‚ÄîInhale and Exhale. Inhale is to bend forward from the hips, lowering the chest towards the floor, while keeping the lower neck straight. Exhale is to straighten the body to return to the start position to complete one repetition. Spinal extension One type of exercise done on a Roman chair is a type of lower- back hyperextension performed to strengthen the lower back, especially the erector spinae. The chair holds a person in place, lying prone, as he or she bends at the waist and then extends the body upward. The exercise is characterized by the two right angles formed by the body, one at the hips and one at the knees. The person enters into the 'chair', with the pad supporting the front of the upper thighs and locking the lower leg (typically at the ankle or heel), bending forward at the waist. As you bend forward, your upper body will become closer to the ground. When you have bent as far as comfortable, use the muscles of your lower back to straighten your body, extending your upper body upwards. Many people at this point extend to the point of a hyperextension and curve their backs beyond typical straightness. Great care must be used during this exercise as the lower back can easily be injured. Spinal flexion The Roman chair is also used to perform exercises for the abdomen. An exerciser lies supine with their hips supported on the rear (weight on the gluteus maximus) as they bent backwards and lift themselves up with their rectus abdominis while stabilizing the pelvis with the hip flexors. If the pelvis moves during the exercise then the hip flexors will also be dynamic prime movers.ExRx.net: Bodyweight Roman Chair Situp, Weighted Roman Chair Situp Knee extension An exercise more commonly referred to as the wall sit, an isometric movement to build strength in the quadriceps, may also be called the Roman chair.Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma illustrates wall sit It involves a person with their back against the wall, pushing into it using the action of knee extension. Even though it is called a \\"sit\\", the hips are actually not being held up by sitting on something. Rather, the body is held up via a combination of weight borne on the feet and friction created with the wall by exerting pressure against it. Another exercise called the \\"Roman chair squat\\" requires using the quadriceps dynamically. It similarly mimics a sitting motion without actually sitting down on something, and can be done on an apparatus similar to the aforementioned spinal exercises. This is similar to a \\"sissy squat\\".

A notable compendium of essays titled The Madonna Connection was published in 1992. Controversy over this field of study stemmed from discussions over the intellectual worth of pursuing academic inquiry into a pop musician, with some arguing the field was nothing more than pop cultural commentary. History Madonna first came to prominence in the mid 1980s, and the discipline did not take long to start up. Robert Miklitsch dates the start of Madonna studies to 1987 and Rocking Around The Clock: Music Television, Postmodernism & Consumer Culture by E. Ann Kaplan. By the early 1990s it was the topic of wider media interest, and commentators were already attacking the growing field. In 1992, Vanity Fair reported that \\"academics are doing a brisk trade in Madonna-ology\\". A collection of scholarly articles, The Madonna Connection: Representational Politics, Subcultural Identities, and Cultural Theory edited by Cathy Schwichtenberg, was published in late 1992. The justification the creation of studies and bibliography focused on Madonna and validity that they have is a subject of debate among scholars and academics. These studies analyzed several topics, but mostly Madonna Studies involved in the study of gender, sexuality, and the mass media. One of her advocates is Annalee Newitz saying that to \\"the university communities Madonna occupies a definite place in the curriculum of post-Western cultures in universities worldwide\\". Professor and media scholar John Fiske explained that all cultural studies focus primarily on finding a hidden meaning within a social aspect ‚Äîfor example, a Madonna video‚Äî so it takes a more comprehensive analysis to provide an appropriate context ‚Äîin this case, on the work of singer‚Äî. Similarly, the American psychologist Susan Fiske, noted that \\"cultural studies about Madonna only analyze texts and how your audience uses the material to relate to the social construction that is Madonna. French academic Georges Claude Guilbert, who has written three books about Madonna, said in one of them \\"is a bit excessive admiration imply that scholars have for Madonna is the result of a common hostility to censorship\\". Given her constant social provocations, often with political overtones, the novelist Andrew O'Hagan said that \\"Madonna is like a heroic opponent of cultural and political authoritarianism of the American \\"establishment\\". Since her debut, are has written several thesis, essays and scientific trials encuadrable in various branches of the social sciences. It was probably in the 1990s when this phenomenon was most critical and began to divide opinions at the used widely the term \\"Madonna Studies\\". According to author Robert Miklitsch of the State University of New York Press, this term is a \\"political-cultural\\" phenomenon. In 1991, the firm Knight Ridder published an article on the subject titled Madonna even controversial for scholars, citing comments from several teachers and other personalities. Meanwhile, Barbara Stewart from Orlando Sentinel, said there was a \\"growing number of \\"Madonna Studies\\" in the United States, [where authors] wrote their works for academic journals and conventions\\". She added that overseas for many \\"was a laugh hear of Madonna Studies\\". She continued that \\"neither this study theme sit well with some students of higher education\\". Beyond all this, organizations like the set of liberal arts colleges 7 sisters teach courses that examine the influence of Madonna in culture. In this regard, the French scholar Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in the book Madonna as Postmodern Myth (2002), Princeton, Harvard, UCLA, the University of Colorado and Rutgers were the first to propose courses \\"about\\" Madonna. He added that even at the University of Amsterdam was created the elective academic discipline, Madonna: The Music and the Phenomenon, within the Department of Musicology. Criticism There is debate about whether Madonna should have a place in curriculums alongside more established and canonical subjects. Roger Kimball described it as \\"a waste of time and money\\", while others have defended the importance of studying modern culture. Others like Camille Paglia take a middle ground, saying \\"We do not need a whole course in Madonna, but within a big course like mine, it is absolutely legitimate to show how images of the present inherit the meanings of the past.\\"Mastering Madonna, Rolling Stone It has also been criticised for adding nothing to students' employment prospects.Are some degree courses a joke?, BBC, 22 August 2000 See also * Bibliography of works on Madonna ReferencesBibliography * Studies Category:Media studies Category:Cultural studies ","title":"Madonna Studies"},{"id":"13300865","text":"Map of diplomatic missions in Myanmar This is a list of diplomatic missions in Myanmar.

The dam at Guajataca Lake experienced a structural failure on September 22, 2017, due to the hit from Hurricane Maria. The river, R√≠o Guajataca, also carries the name. Guajataca Dam The Guajataca Dam is an earthen dam used for irrigation and potable water purposes. The reservoir has a normal surface area of , its length is , its maximum width is , and its maximum discharge is per second. Its normal storage capacity is , and its drainage basin is . It is the location of Guajataka Scout Reservation. Dam construction The construction of the dam was authorized by act 63 of the Legislature of Puerto Rico, known as the \\"Isabela public irrigation law,\\" approved April 19, 1919. The dam was constructed starting in 1928. The reservoir had an initial storage capacity of , but by 1999 (71 years later), the capacity had been reduced to , as about 13% less, attributed to sediment erosion. The surface area of the reservoir was in 1999. According to the National Inventory of Dams, Guajataca Dam was designed by and is owned by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.

The dam lies across the Guajataca River to form a reservoir that can hold roughly 11 billion gallons of water. , the dam was last inspected on October 23, 2013. The first phase of repairs to avoid the threat of flooding were completed on November 17, 2017. Since then about 10,000 residents, including farmers, who depend on the waters of the reservoir, have been struggling with the rationing of water.

She was executed in 250, near the beginning of Emperor Decius' violent suppression of Christians within the Roman Empire. Kalliopi's martyrdom according to Church tradition There are no reliable historic sources for details of Kalliopi's martyrdom, though it is generally accepted that she was beheaded. By the age of twenty-one (by third century standards a ripe age), Kalliope had already passed the age at which most girls marry. In fact she had no social prospects at all. She spent her days dedicated to her religion with little thought to social life. She hadn't been deemed ready for marriage even though she was obedient and met the criteria for marriage. When at last she seemed ready for marriage, many suitors asked for her hand. One pagan suitor sent word that were she to reject him in favor of another, especially a Christian, he would see to it that the pagan authorities would carry out their form of justice. Kalliopi did not hesitate to not only deny this suitor, but made it plain that she would not marry him even if he were a Christian‚Äîsuch a conversion, she said, could not be reliably authentic. This didn't bring her any more acclaim from the Romans who saw her as rebellious, not to mention that she was a Christian in a pagan land. The spurned suitor arranged for her to be brought before a magistrate, where she was accused of a variety of crimes ranging from a mockery of the pagan faith to treason against the state. According to tradition, the suitor paid a parade of witnesses to testify against Kalliope in order to destroy her reputation. She was deemed guilty, and the rejected suitor stepped forth to offer a withdrawal of the charges against her if she would disavow Christ and become his pagan bride. The alternative was torture, and if that didn‚Äôt bend her will, then it was death. Taken to the public square, she was bound to the post and mercilessly flogged until her clothing and flesh were in tatters. Her beautiful face was scarred with branding irons and salt was poured into her open wounds, and while the breath of life was still within her she was told to disavow Christ. When she refused she was beheaded. Veneration Kalliopi is venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church. She is pictured in art with a hot iron pressed to her breast, emblematic of the branding that she is supposed to have suffered before death. Her feast is celebrated on June 8.

The donjon, the major defensive component of the castle, measures approximately 30 metres in height and 13.6 metres in diameter. It is the typical of the donjons being built by King Philip II Augustus of France at this time, like at Rouen and other French nobility throughout the 13th century. The conception of the geometric pattern and isolated donjon was similar to that of the castle of the Louvre.

Among some of the notable personages who resided in the castle were Philip IV of France's daughter-in- law, Joan II, Countess of Burgundy, detained there from 1314 to 1315 in relation to the Tour de Nesle affair, and La Hire, one of Joan of Arc's comrades-in-arms. At the end of the 17th century, the Ch√¢teau de Dourdan was given to the Duke of Orl√©ans who turned it into prison. The donjon was used as a prison until 1852. It now houses a museum of local history. Gallery Image:Chateau de Dourdan.svgOutline plan of the castle with its isolated keep. Image:Dourdan walls gate.jpgThe walls around the castle of Dourdan.

They are particularly venerated in Eastern Christianity Zenaida and Philonella were sisters, born into a well-educated Jewish family and said to be cousins of Paul the Apostle. They were instructed and baptized into the Christian faith by their brother Jason, who was bishop of their native city of Tarsus. On entering the philosophical academy at Tarsus, they devoted themselves to the study of medicine, and when they completed their studies moved to the mountains around Pelion near Demetriada in Thessaly. This was a region renowned for its healing springs and shrines to Asclepius. The physicians who practiced there catered to the wealthy, charging exorbitant amounts for their services, and augmented their incomes with the sale of magical amulets and charms. The sisters set themselves in opposition to the prevailing custom. On locating a cave with a mineral spring, they set up a chapel and cells for themselves, and opened a clinic where they treated all who came to them regardless of their ability to pay. Philonella devoted herself to experimental medicine, using methods approaching that of modern scientific methods, and worked hard to separate effective medicine from superstition. Zenaida was particularly interested in pediatrics. Toward the end of her life she paid particular attention to the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including clinical depression. Both sisters devoted their lives to prayer when they were not working in their clinic. Traditions vary about their deaths. According to one account, the two were stoned to death by pagans on the same night. According to another, both met peaceful ends, with Philonella surviving her sister by some years, deepening her spiritual devotion and becoming known as a wonderworker. They are commemorated on October 11. The name of Zenaida is derived from the , Zenais, \\"of Zeus\\".Behind the Name: Zenaida Zinaida Her becoming a Christian in general and a venerated saint in particular assured this name's continued use in Christian countries, its Pagan origin forgotten.

Spahn rented the ranch to the movie industry to film Westerns, and later allowed Charles Manson and his \\"Family\\" of followers to live at the site.  Early life  Spahn grew up in the greater Philadelphia area. His father died in a work accident, when he was just two years old. Spahn had at times a tense relationship with his stepfather, who often exposed vicious and violent behaviour when he was drunk. Spahn left school already after the third grade and started to work as milkman. When he was 16 Spahn started an apprenticeship with a carpenter, however he didn't stay in this profession and eventually returned to the milk delivery business. He set up a business in Willow Grove owning five carriages and seven horses. He also employed his stepfather at this point. Before he was 30 Spahn acquired a farm of 86 acres in Lansdale, where he kept 36 cows and some horses. He married the widow Martha Virginia Greenholtz, who he originally had hired as a housekeeper for his farm. The couple had ten children together and a daughter from Greenholtz first marriage.Gay Talese: Charlie Manson's Home on the Range. Esquire, 1 March 1970 In the early 1930s during the great depression Spahn's milk business was facing difficulties and he felt somewhat disenchanted with his life in general. This led him to start over in California. He sold his farm and moved his family and favorite horses to Los Angeles. There he gave up on the milk business and turned to raising horses and offering horse riding. In the late 1940 he separated from his wife and in 1953 he bought the movie ranch now carrying his name.Hadley Hall Meares:The Story of the Abandoned Movie Ranch Where the Manson Family Launched Helter Skelter. Curbed, 22 October 2014 (additional online copy)  Spahn Ranch and Manson Family  Spahn continued to raise horses and to offer horse riding trips. He also extended the already existing western film sets of the ranch and rented them out to film and TV productions. However due to declining demand for Western productions his business went bankrupt in 1966. After Spahn continued to live on the ranch with most of its buildings, in particular the film sets, being in disrepair. Spahn is chiefly remembered for his association with the Manson Family, due to his tolerance of the Manson group's residence on his property. At the ranch, Spahn housed Charles Manson and his followers from 1968 on. The 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and six others by Manson's devotees were allegedly hatched at the Spahn Ranch. Manson persuaded Spahn to permit \\"the Family\\" to live at his ranch. Manson ordered the women in the group to clean and cook for the nearly blind 80-year-old. The women also acted as seeing eye guides for Spahn.Bugliosi, Vincent with Gentry, Curt. Helter Skelter ‚Äì The True Story of the Manson Murders 25th Anniversary Edition, W.W.

One of his best-known works, a bust of his father, is on display outside the Lincoln Borglum Visitors Center at Mount Rushmore. Life and career Named after his father's favorite president, Abraham Lincoln, and called by his middle name, Lincoln Borglum was the first child of Gutzon Borglum and his second wife, Mary Montgomery Williams (1874-1955). During his youth, Lincoln accompanied his father to the Black Hills of South Dakota and was present when the site for the Mount Rushmore monument was selected. Although he had originally planned to study engineering at the University of Virginia, Lincoln Borglum began work on the monument in 1933 at the age of 21 as an unpaid pointer. Lincoln Borglum quickly moved into a series of more important jobs: He was put on the payroll in 1934, promoted to assistant sculptor in 1937, and promoted to superintendent in 1938 with an annual salary of $4,800. Gutzon Borglum had nearly completed the 60-foot heads of the four presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and T. Roosevelt) when he died on March 6, 1941. Lincoln Borglum had to abandon his father's ambitious plans to carry the work down to include the torsos of the presidents and an entablature due to a lack of funding; he left the monument largely in the state of completion it had reached under his father's direction. Borglum was appointed Mount Rushmore National Memorial's first superintendent and began serving on October 1, 1941. The work on the monument officially stopped on October 31, 1941. He served in that capacity until May 15, 1944. Borglum continued to work as a sculptor after leaving Mount Rushmore. He created several religious works for churches in Texas, including the well-known shrine Our Lady of Loreto in Goliad. Borglum also wrote three books about the sculpting of Mount Rushmore. Lincoln Borglum was a member of Battle River Masonic Lodge No. 92 in Hermosa, South Dakota.Famous Masons of the 20th Century Like many of the men who worked on the Rushmore project, Borglum's lungs were permanently scarred from breathing in granite dust associated with the blasting.

After initial success in developing a glow-in-the-dark radioactive paint, the company was subject to several lawsuits in the late 1920s in the wake of severe illnesses and deaths of workers (the Radium Girls) who had ingested radioactive material. The workers had been told that the paint was harmless. During World War I and World War II, the company produced luminous watches and gauges for the United States Army for use by soldiers. U.S. Radium workers, especially women who painted the dials of watches and other instruments with luminous paint, suffered serious radioactive contamination. Lawyer Edward Markley was in charge of defending the company in these cases. History The company was founded in 1914 in New York City, by Dr. Sabin Arnold von Sochocky and Dr. George S. Willis, as the Radium Luminous Material Corporation. The company produced uranium from carnotite ore and eventually moved into the business of producing radioluminescent paint, and then to the application of that paint. Over the next several years, it opened facilities in Newark, Jersey City, and Orange. In August 1921, von Sochocky was forced from the presidency, and the company was renamed the United States Radium Corporation. In Orange, where radium was extracted from 1917 to 1926, the U.S. Radium facility processed half a ton of ore per day. The ore was obtained from \\"Undark mines\\" in Paradox Valley, Colorado and in Utah. A notable employee from 1921 to 1923 was Victor Francis Hess, who would later receive the Nobel Prize in Physics. The company's luminescent paint, marketed as Undark, was a mixture of radium and zinc sulfide; the radiation causing the sulfide to fluoresce. During World War I, demand for dials, watches, and aircraft instruments painted with Undark surged, and the company expanded operations considerably. The delicate task of painting watch and gauge faces was done mostly by young women, who were instructed to maintain a fine tip on their paintbrushes by licking them. At the time, the dangers of radiation were not well understood. Around 1920, a similar radium dial business, known as the Radium Dial Company, a division of the Standard Chemical Company, opened in Chicago. It soon moved its dial painting operation to Ottawa, Illinois to be closer to its major customer, the Westclox Clock Company. Several workers died, and the health risks associated with radium were allegedly known, but this company continued dial painting operations until 1940. Radium Crystallization Laboratory, Orange, NJ U.S. Radium's management and scientists took precautions such as masks, gloves, and screens, but did not similarly equip the workers. Unbeknownst to the women, the paint was highly radioactive and therefore, carcinogenic. The ingestion of the paint by the women, brought about while licking the brushes, resulted in a condition called radium jaw (radium necrosis), a painful swelling and porosity of the upper and lower jaws that ultimately led to many of their deaths. This led to litigation against U.S. Radium by the so-called Radium Girls, starting with former dial painter Marguerite Carlough in 1925. The case was eventually settled in 1926 and several more suits were brought against the company in 1927 by Grace Fryer and Katherine Schaub. The company did not stop the hand painting of dials until 1947. The company struggled after World War I: the loss of military contracts sharply reduced demand for luminescent paint and dials, and in 1922, high-grade ore was discovered in Katanga, driving all U.S. suppliers out of business except U.S. Radium and the Standard Chemical Company. U.S. Radium consolidated its operations in Manhattan in 1927, leasing out the Orange plant and selling off other property. But demand for luminescent products surged again during World War II; by 1942, it employed as many as 1,000 workers, and in 1944 was reported to have radium mining, processing, and application facilities in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania; Bernardsville, New Jersey; Whippany, New Jersey; and North Hollywood, California as well as New York City. In 1945 the Office of Strategic Services enlisted the company's help for tests of a psychological-warfare scheme to release foxes with glowing paint in Japan. After the war came another period of retrenchment. Not only did military supply contracts end, but luminous dial manufacturing shifted to promethium-147 and tritium. Also, radium mining in Canada ceased in 1954, driving up supply costs. In that year, the company consolidated its operations at facilities in Morristown, New Jersey and South Centre Township east of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. In Bloomsburg, it continued to produce items with luminescent paint using radium, strontium-90 and cesium-137 such as watch dials, instrument gauge faces, deck markers, and paint. It ceased radium processing altogether in 1968, spinning off those operations as Nuclear Radiation Development Corporation, LLC, based in Grand Island, New York. The following year, a new facility at the Bloomsburg plant opened for the manufacturing of \\"tritiated metal foils and tritium activated self-luminous light tubes,\\" and the company switched focus to the manufacture of glow-in-the-dark exit and aircraft signs using tritium. Starting in 1979, the company underwent an extensive reorganization. A new corporation, Metreal, Inc., was created to hold the assets of the Bloomsburg plant. Manufacturing operations were subsequently moved into new wholly owned subsidiary corporations: Safety Light Corporation, USR Chemical Products, USR Lighting, USR Metals, and U.S. Natural Resources. Finally, in May 1980, U.S. Radium created a new holding company, USR Industries, Inc., and merged itself into it. The Safety Light Corporation, in turn, was sold to its management and spun off as an independent entity in 1982. Tritium-illuminated signs were marketed under the name Isolite, which also became the name of new subsidiary to market and distribute Safety Light Corporation's products. In 2005, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission declined to renew the licenses for the Bloomsburg facility, and shortly thereafter the EPA added the Bloomsburg facility to the National Priorities List for remediation through Superfund. All tritium operations at the plant ceased by the end of 2007. Immediate aftermath The chief medical examiner of Essex County, New Jersey, Harrison Stanford Martland, MD, published a report in 1925 that identified the radioactive material the women had ingested as the cause of their bone disease and aplastic anemia, and ultimately death. Illness and death resulting from ingestion of radium paint and the subsequent legal action taken by the women forced closure of the company's Orange facility in 1927. The case was settled out of court in 1928, but not before a substantial number of the litigants were seriously ill or had died from bone cancer and other radiation-related illnesses.Radium dial painters, 1920‚Äì1926, Johnston's Archive. Accessed September 17, 2007. The company, it was alleged, deliberately delayed settling litigation, leading to further deaths. In November 1928, Dr. von Sochocky, the inventor of the radium-based paint, died of aplastic anemia resulting from his exposure to the radioactive material, \\"a victim of his own invention.\\"\\"RADIUM PAINT TAKES ITS INVENTOR'S LIFE; Dr. Sabin A. von Sochocky Ill a Long Time, Poisoned by Watch Dial Luminant. 13 BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS Death Due to Aplastic Anemia-- Women Workers Who Were Stricken Sued Company.\\", The New York Times, November 15, 1928.

The school was founded in 1934 by Helen Corning Warden and is located at 1920 Spruce Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.New York Times 2008 History During the Great Depression, few people could afford any kind of higher education, especially the long and costly training needed for a career in opera. Recognizing this difficulty, Helen Corning Warden, a prominent member of Philadelphia society, set out to establish a school where talented singers could receive highest quality training without having to suffer the financial burdens that such an education would normally entail. Encouraged by voice teacher Edgar Milton Cooke, Mrs. Warden and a group of her friends set out to establish a school for professional singers that would provide tuition-free education. For more than six decades, gifted singers have come from throughout the world to seek training. Many current and former teachers, such as Sidney Dietch, Nicola Moscona, Giovanni Consiglio, Louis Quilico, Benita Valente, Nell Rankin, Bill Schuman and William Stone, have had highly successful careers. Admission into AVA's four-year program is highly competitive, with approximately 28 singers enrolled in any given year. Today, AVA is the only tuition-free institution dedicated exclusively to the study of voice. Helen Corning Warden served as the Academy's chairperson until her death. She was succeeded by her daughter, Adele Warden Paxson, who was followed by her daughter, Sally Paxson Davis. Since 1977, Christofer Macatsoris has held the position of music director. Baritone and 1983 alum K. James McDowell has served as president and artistic director since 1987. Program The program of training offered by the Academy of Vocal Arts is centered on one-on-one repertoire coaching with a faculty of conductors and coaches and a weekly voice lesson with one of AVA's esteemed voice instructors. The program also includes French, German and Italian language classes, movement & dance, stagecraft and stage combat classes, history of opera & care of the professional voice seminars, and professional development coaching through private classes and workshops. AVA mounts four operatic productions each year featuring resident artists in leading and supporting roles, produced and directed by visiting professional directors with full orchestra. Additionally, chamber music recitals, a sacred music concert and an annual vocal competition feature in the Academy's season. Resident artists are given opportunities to audition for visiting companies from the US and Europe as well as international agents and managers. The Academy of Vocal Arts is also unique among training institutions in offering all residents merit-based fellowships to help offset the cost of living expenses while attending AVA.

It aired in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on September 16, 2007. Filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the film is the 2nd title in the Maneater Series produced under an agreement with Syfy. Featuring a cast of four, the film focuses on a group of teenagers who struggle to survive in a restricted forest while an enraged grizzly bear hunts them relentlessly seeking retribution for killing its cub. Grizzly Rage breaks the standard mold for many Syfy natural horror films in that the bear featured is a normal grizzly bear rather than a mutant or genetically altered animal. However, the bear and actors never appear together in the same frame, rather a man in a bear suit takes over the role when the actors must interact with the bear. Critics panned the film, feeling its plot, script, characters, and special effects were substandard. Plot Sean (Graham Kosakoski), Ritch (Brody Harms), Wes (Tyler Hoechlin), and Lauren (Kate Todd) celebrate their college graduation by breaking into Saranoc Grotto, a forest heavily marked with \\"No Trespassing\\" signs and surrounded by a tall fence. While speeding down a dirt road, they hit and kill a grizzly bear cub, sending their Jeep Cherokee into a tree and cracking the radiator. As they argue over whether they should bury the dead cub, they hear its mother coming and run. The vehicle overheats down the road so Wes and Ritch go into the forest to find water. The grizzly bear finds and attacks Ritch. Having heard Ritch's screams to run, Wes inadvertently runs into the bear and it attacks him. The other two arrive and rescue Wes, but are unable to help Ritch. The bear kills him while the others flee to the Jeep. The vehicle starts again and they leave, but Wes panics and tries to force Sean to turn around and go back for Ritch, causing the car to go over a cliff. Calmer, he wants to wait for help, but no one knows where they are because they had told their families they were going somewhere else. They winch the vehicle back up to the road, but they cannot get it to start. Sean goes alone and jogs out of the forest to find help while Wes and Lauren wait at the Jeep. He comes across a deserted shack where he finds hunting paraphernalia, a bear trap, and dead animals. As he leaves, the bear appears. He tries to sneak past the bear, but instead he runs into the bear, it throws him on the roof of the shack and then he falls into a chicken coop. Hours later he makes it back to the Jeep, but his leg is injured. Wes decides to climb a tall hill on the other side of the clearing to see if he can get a signal on his cell phone, but to no avail and the bear nearly catches him. He quickly climbs back down and gets back to the Jeep though it still will not start. He and Lauren hide in the Jeep with the wounded Sean in the back. The bear follows and climbs on top of the Jeep, smashing up the car and eventually overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the deserted shack, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the shack. While Lauren is exploring the shack with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body. Wes grabs a can of gasoline and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the grizzly bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes on the ground to trick the bear. While the bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops the tire iron, alerting the bear to his presence. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The bear catches up to them and kills them both. Production In October 2006, RHI Entertainment made a deal with the Sci Fi Channel to produce a series of ten made-for-television natural horror films to air on the network the following year. Dubbed the \\"Maneater\\" series by RHI Entertainment, Grizzly Rage was the sixth film released. Although the agreement called for the films to premiere on SciFi, the first six films in the series actually premiered in Canada on the video on demand (VOD) channel Movie Central on Demand first due to a pre-licensing agreement. It also aired on other VOD channels before its Sci Fi airing. Grizzly Rage was filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It breaks from the standard mold many natural horror films follow in that the bear attacking the main characters is not a mutant or genetically altered, rather it is a normal, but furious mother bear. The mother bear is played by Koda, a male grizzly bear, working at the direction of a trainer. To induce the bear to appear to be roaring, the trainer gave it marshmallows to make it smile. The roaring sounds were dubbed in later. Both Tyler Hoechlin and Graham Kosakoski noted that they were a little afraid of the bear and director David DeCoteau felt that working with such a powerful live animal added element of danger for the cast and crew during filming. As such, the bear is never actually filmed together with any of the actors. For scenes where the bear is supposed to interact with the characters, a man in a bear suit takes over the role. Distribution Grizzly Rage premiered in Canada on the subscription- based video-on-demand channel Movie Central on Demand on June 7, 2007. It aired in the United States on the Sci Fi channel on September 16, 2007 for the channel's Saturday Night \\"Movie of the Week\\" premiere. Genius Products released the film to Region 1 DVD on May 6, 2008. The DVD release features a good video transfer, but an incorrectly mixed audio track. It has no extras, subtitles, or closed captions. The film was re-released on August 19, 2008 as part of the second volume of the \\"Maneater Series Collection\\" sets. The volume also included Croc and Eye of the Beast, the fourth and fifth films in the series, respectively. Reception Critics panned Grizzly Rage. Film historian Paul Mavis called the film \\"a pathetically undernourished effort\\", feeling the film was plagued with a bad plot, bad acting, bad direction, and bad special effects. In comparing Grizzly, a 1976 natural horror film, and Grizzly Man, a 2005 documentary showing the life and death of amateur bear enthusiast Timothy Treadwell, he found it sorely lacking. Mavis states that it was a horror film that did not show anyone getting \\"sliced, diced, munched on and stomped\\" by the bear. He also heavily criticizes the film for not having any scenes where the bear is actually in the same frame as any of the actors, wondering if the actors and/or trainers were afraid something tragic would happen. As a whole, he recommended skipping the film. Film critic David Walker agreed. Like Mavis, Walker compared the film to the 1976 Grizzly and found it severely lacking. He also felt the plot was poorly conceived and was combined with a badly written script and uninteresting characters: Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and Critics repeated many of the same sentiments in his review of the film. He hated the characters within the first five minutes of the film and found himself wishing that the film had shown more of the bear just walking in the woods rather than the characters talking with one another between the attacks. Matt Gamble of UGO Entertainment was excited by the film's cover, but was also quickly disappointed by \\"insipid dialog\\" amongst the characters and their continuously calling each other \\"dude.\\" The characters actually asking what a bear was doing in the Canadian wilderness, where bears are plentiful, amused him, though he notes that it was probably not the intended reaction for the scene. His final rating of the film was an \\"F.\\" DVD Verdict's David Johnson also questioned why the bear and actors are never seen on screen together. He derided the scenes in which the bear would make a swiping motion, and the scene would cut to show a character flying through the air: \\"I don't know how the bear mastered the art of jujitsu in the wild, but it comes in handy when four teenagers snuff your cub and they need a healthy dose of comeuppance.\\" He also wondered at the lack of fake blood or props being used during attacks rather than \\"ridiculous blood splatter computer graphics tossed on the screen.\\" Multiple critics noted that the film introduced two potentially interesting subplots that ended up being pointless as the film never explored either, and they all agreed that the film had excellent picture quality. Tim Anderson, reviewer for Bloody Disgusting, disagreed on some points. He found the film to be cheesy, but very watchable. He praised DeCocteau's pacing of the film and felt the cast of four was \\"serviceable.\\" He also praised the use of a real bear. Like other reviewers, was disappointed by the bear not being in the same scenes with the actors though he notes that at least the bear suit used in such scenes was well made. As a whole, he notes that \\"ridiculous is the very nature of the Maneater Series. So, I don't fault them for following suit on this production...\\" and concludes with the remark that Grizzly Rage is \\"a pretty silly but satisfying little fright flick\\" and rated it a seven out of ten. Soundtrack Sci Fi licensed the song \\"Bright Light Rockin'City\\" by rock band Floor Thirteen for use in the film. Though the film's soundtrack has not been released to CD in North America, it was released on soundtrack in Australia on June 19, 2008 by Horizon.

Description Emmenanthe is monotypic genus of annual plants with fleshy foliage which exudes a sticky juice with a light medicinal odor. The plant comes up from a weedy-looking basal rosette of sharply lobed leaves. Inflorescence is a terminal cluster of flowers, borne on slender pedicels less than 1 inch long. Blooms have five sepals and five yellow or pinkish petals in a bell-shaped. Flowers dry and become light and papery. The dry hanging flowers make a rustling sound when a breeze comes through, giving the whispering bells its common name. The dry flower also contains a fruit about a centimeter wide. Habitat This flower is most common in dry, recently burned areas; germination of the seeds may be triggered by the presence of burned plant material. It is a common plant of the chaparral ecosystem, which is prone to wildfire.

He printed several first editions and early texts of Shakespeare's works.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 452. Short became a \\"freeman\\" (full member) of the Stationers Company on 1 March 1589, and operated his own business from that year until his death; he was partnered with Richard Yardley until 1593. His shop was at the sign of the star on Bread Street Hill. About a third of his titles involved translations from Latin or contemporary European languages. Short began publishing music in 1597; he issued Thomas Morley's A Plaine and Easy Introduction and both Canzonets, Dowland's First Book of Songs, Holborne's Cittharn School, and Hunnis's Seven Sobs. Short used type which was passed on and used by his successors (Humphrey Lownes, James Young).Robert Steele, The Earliest English Music Printing, London, Bibliographical Society, 1903.D.W. Krummel, English Music Printing 1553-1700, London, Bibliographical Society, 1975. In an era when the functions of publisher and printer were often largely (though not entirely) separate, Short was primarily a printer and only secondarily a publisher; he printed just over 170 works in his career, and the publishers of about 100 are known.Andrew Murphy, A Concise Companion to Shakespeare and the Text, London, Blackwell, 2007; pp. 217-19. Short likely published a good portion of the others himself. Apart from Shakespeare's works, Short's most important printing tasks were: the famous 1600 first edition of William Gilbert's De Magnete; the 1601 edition of the Annals of John Stow; and the completion of the fifth edition (1597) of the Acts and Monuments, or Book of Martyrs of John Foxe. He also printed the first edition (1600) of Marlowe's translation of Lucan's Pharsalia for Thomas Thorpe. Regarding Shakespeare, Short printed: * The first quarto of Henry VI, Part 3 (1595), for publisher Thomas Millington. This was the \\"bad quarto,\\" the early alternative text of Shakespeare's play known as The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York. * The first quarto of Henry IV, Part 1 (1598), for Andrew Wise. * The second edition of The Rape of Lucrece (1598), for John Harrison. This was the first edition of that poem in octavo rather than quarto format (O1). * The fifth edition of Venus and Adonis (1599), for William Leake; the third octavo edition (O3). For Cuthbert Burby, Short printed Palladis Tamia (1598) by Francis Meres, a book that contains an important early reference to Shakespeare and a list of his plays performed up to 1598. Short printed a few non-Shakespearean play texts as well: * For Burby, Short printed Q1 and Q2 of The Taming of a Shrew (1594, 1596), the early alternative version of Shakespeare's The Shrew. * For William Ponsonby, he printed the closet drama Antony (1595), translated from the French of Robert Garnier by the Countess of Pembroke. * For Simon Waterson, he printed the third, 1598 edition of Samuel Daniel's Cleopatra. * And for William Holme, Short printed one of the three editions of Jonson's Every Man Out of His Humour that appeared in a single year, 1600. Short's connection with the Shakespeare canon has led scholars to study his printed output and learn details of the workings of his shop, including the compositors he employed.Alan E. Craven, \\"The Compositors of the Shakespeare Quartos Printed by Peter Short,\\" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, 65 (1971), pp. 393-7.

Mills was born and raised in New England and after an education in medicine, came to Cleveland in 1827. He came as a physician and established the most successful pharmacy in the city. In 1832, Mills became public figure, when his aid in the Cholera Epidemic of 1832 made him a member of the city's first Board of Health. In 1936, Mills became a Whig alderman, a member of Cleveland City Council and in 1837, its president. A year later, he was elected mayor of Cleveland.

VoIP Servers (INVITE of Death) The INVITE of Death vulnerability was found http://opensbc.blogspot.be/2012/11/opensbc-invite-of-death.html on February 16, 2009. The vulnerability allows the attacker to crash the server causing remote Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a single malformed packet. An impersonator can, using a malformed packet, overflow the specific string buffers, add a large number of token characters, and modify fields in an illegal fashion. As a result, a server is tricked into an undefined state, which can lead to call processing delays, unauthorized access, and a complete denial of service. The problem specifically exists in OpenSBC version 1.1.5-25 in the handling of the ‚ÄúVia‚Äù field from a maliciously crafted SIP packet. The INVITE of Death packet was also used to find a new vulnerability in the patched OpenSBC server through network dialog minimization.http://zubairrafique.wordpress.com/2014/09/30/invite-of-death- and-network-dialog-minimization-new-vulnerability-in-voip- server/http://osvdb.net/show/osvdb/86607 For the popular open source-based Asterisk PBX, there are security advisories that cover not only signaling- related problems, but also problems with other protocols and their resolution.http://www.asterisk.org/security Problems may be malformed SDP attachments where codex numbers are out of the valid range or obsolete headers such as ‚ÄúAlso‚Äù. The INVITE of Death is specifically a problem for operators that run their servers on the public internet. Because SIP allows the usage of UDP packets, it is easy for an attacker to spoof any source address in the internet and send the INVITE of death from untraceable locations. By sending these kinds of requests periodically, attackers can completely interrupt the telephony service. The only choice for the service provider is to upgrade their systems until the attack does not crash the system anymore. VoIP phones A large number of VoIP Vulnerabilities exist for IP phones. DoS attacks on VoIP phones are less critical than attacks on central devices like IP-PBX, as, usually, only the endpoint is affected.

It is built in the Queen Anne style, painted green and white. The building began life as a one-room schoolhouse rolled into the hamlet on logs in 1875. Fifty years later it was one of the few buildings to survive a fire that destroyed many other buildings in the community. It remained in use as a school, expanded to two rooms, until 1981. The town began using it shortly afterwards, but it served mainly as a meeting place for the town board. Other offices were housed elsewhere in the town, often at the firehouse across the road and an office plaza downtown. In 2000 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and the town began to seriously consider renovating and expanding it. Some residents did not believe that was necessary, and helped defeat a $1.5 million expansion plan in a March 2001 vote. A vote later that year limited the town to $850,000 for any renovation or construction. Three years later, a new town supervisor, Carl Zatz, initiated a project to renovate and expand the building. It caused some controversy when other town officials and residents publicly expressed doubts that the work could be done for the minimal costs Zatz claimed it would. It was completed for what Zatz's Democratic Party says was less than budgeted. Republican opponents, however, criticized him for destroying the school's outhouse in the process.

They are known to be amongst one of the first American black metal bands. History The band originally formed in 1989 as a solo project by Ixithra as an outlet to express darkness through skilled and creative art. With several side projects and pseudonyms, he has been known as Wicked Warlock Of Demonic Blasphemy and Lord Of The Sylvan Shadows. The music is regarded as both otherworldly and demonic. In 1992, Ixithra joined the USBM band Profanatica in the role of guitar player. He terminated the relationship shortly thereafter. Ixithra soon revived Demoncy. It was with the 1999 release of Joined In Darkness, that Demoncy was cemented in black metal history. Regarded by many as the finest example of USBM ever produced The band toured the US and Europe and were featured in several metal music festivals.  Significance  Demoncy is credited as early practitioners of black metal in the United States, who did not imitate the popularized Early Norwegian black metal scene. Style and ideology Demoncy is known for keeping away from the commercial masses, putting a focus on the mysteries of the occult and the theme of keeping the purity of darkness in the music's design. Song lyrics are centered on occult and magical themes. Not limiting themselves only to Satanism or similarly popular paganist thinking, the band are fiercely anti-collectivist. There is a focus on elements of atmospheric and ethereal horror, nihilism and individualism.

The process of chemical reaction can be considered as involving the diffusion of reactants until they encounter each other in the right stoichiometry and form an activated complex which can form the product species. The observed rate of chemical reactions is, generally speaking, the rate of the slowest or \\"rate determining\\" step. In diffusion controlled reactions the formation of products from the activated complex is much faster than the diffusion of reactants and thus the rate is governed by collision frequency. Diffusion control is rare in the gas phase, where rates of diffusion of molecules are generally very high. Diffusion control is more likely in solution where diffusion of reactants is slower due to the greater number of collisions with solvent molecules. Reactions where the activated complex forms easily and the products form rapidly are most likely to be limited by diffusion control. Examples are those involving catalysis and enzymatic reactions. Heterogeneous reactions where reactants are in different phases are also candidates for diffusion control. One classical test for diffusion control is to observe whether the rate of reaction is affected by stirring or agitation; if so then the reaction is almost certainly diffusion controlled under those conditions.

He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland and died at Nanaimo, British Columbia. He married Elizabeth Bate whose brother, Mark Bate, also an HBC employee, was the first Mayor of Nanaimo. Horne arrived in British Columbia as a labourer in 1851 aboard the immigrant ship Tory and was in charge of the company store in Nanaimo when, in 1862, the company sold out. After operating a business on his own account in Nanaimo, he took further employment with the HBC first at its Fort Simpson post and then took charge of its Comox operation from 1865 to 1878 when the post there was closed as well. At that time Horne returned to business on his own account in Nanaimo where he also served as an alderman. In 1856 Horne led what is thought to have been the first crossing of mid- Vancouver Island by a European. He was to ascertain whether a trail existed from the present location of Qualicum Beach, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island's east coast in the hopes of establishing trade with the Nuu-chah-nulth who lived on the west coast. At the mouth of the Qualicum River, Horne's party and their native guides observed a large fleet of Haida canoes approaching and hid in trees unable to warn the villagers of the impending attack. Afterwards, they observed the attackers as they left holding human heads. When they came to the mouth of the river, they came upon the charred remains of the village of SaatlaamPaterson, p 89-94 and the mutilated bodies of its inhabitants.Elms p 20, citing William Wyford Walkem, Stories of Early British Columbia, \\"Adam Horne's trip across Vancouver Island\\" (Vancouver, BC: Published by News Advertiser, 1914) p 41.

The orphan trains operated between 1854 and 1929, relocating about 200,000 orphaned, abandoned, abused, or homeless children. Three charitable institutions, Children's Village (founded 1851 by 24 philanthropists), *a \\"...from the most careful inquiry, they regard suited to have the charge of such children. Six years of experience have increased their caution and watchfulness in this matter, and they now require such guarantees on the part of the masters as will, in their judgment, most conduce to the good of their wards.

In this way, very few are lost sight of, and the results thus far, in the case of those indentured within two years past, are very gratifying.\\" ‚Äî ¬∂ 13 *b \\"On the 30th of June, 1851, the act of incorporation was passed.

Edmonds\\" ‚Äî ¬∂ 7 the Children's Aid Society (established 1853 by Charles Loring Brace) and later, the New York Foundling Hospital, endeavored to help these children. The institutions were supported by wealthy donors and operated by professional staff. The three institutions developed a program that placed homeless, orphaned, and abandoned city children, who numbered an estimated 30,000 in New York City alone in the 1850s, in foster homes throughout the country. The children were transported to their new homes on trains that were labeled \\"orphan trains\\" or \\"baby trains\\". This relocation of children ended in the 1920s with the beginning of organized foster care in America. Background Charles Loring Brace The first orphanage in the United States was reportedly established in 1729 in Natchez, MS,Warren, Andrea. \\"The Orphan Train\\", The Washington Post, 1998 but institutional orphanages were uncommon before the early 19th century. Relatives or neighbors usually raised children who had lost parents. Arrangements were informal and rarely involved courts. Around 1830, the number of homeless children in large Eastern cities such as New York City exploded. In 1850, there were an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 homeless children in New York City. At the time, New York City's population was only 500,000. Some children were orphaned when their parents died in epidemics of typhoid, yellow fever or the flu. Others were abandoned due to poverty, illness or addiction. Many children sold matches, rags, or newspapers to survive. For protection against street violence, they banded together and formed gangs. In 1853, a young minister named Charles Loring Brace became concerned with the plight of street children (often known as \\"street Arabs\\"). He founded the Children's Aid Society. During its first year the Children's Aid Society primarily offered boys religious guidance and vocational and academic instruction. Eventually, the society established the nation's first runaway shelter, the Newsboys' Lodging House, where vagrant boys received inexpensive room and board and basic education. Brace and his colleagues attempted to find jobs and homes for individual children, but they soon became overwhelmed by the numbers needing placement. Brace hit on the idea of sending groups of children to rural areas for adoption. Brace believed that street children would have better lives if they left the poverty and debauchery of their lives in New York City and were instead raised by morally upright farm families.\\"History\\", Children's Aid Society Recognizing the need for labor in the expanding farm country, Brace believed that farmers would welcome homeless children, take them into their homes and treat them as their own. His program would turn out to be a forerunner of modern foster care. After a year of dispatching children individually to farms in nearby Connecticut, Pennsylvania and rural New York, the Children's Aid Society mounted its first large-scale expedition to the Midwest in September 1854.  The term \\"Orphan Train\\"  The phrase \\"orphan train\\" was first used in 1854 to describe the transportation of children from their home area via the railroad. However, the term \\"Orphan Train\\" was not widely used until long after the Orphan Train program had ended. The Children's Aid Society referred to its relevant division first as the Emigration Department, then as the Home-Finding Department, and finally, as the Department of Foster Care. Later, the New York Foundling Hospital sent out what it called \\"baby\\" or \\"mercy\\" trains. Organizations and families generally used the terms \\"family placement\\" or \\"out-placement\\" (\\"out\\" to distinguish it from the placement of children \\"in\\" orphanages or asylums) to refer to orphan train passengers. Widespread use of the term \\"orphan train\\" may date to 1978, when CBS aired a fictional miniseries entitled The Orphan Trains. One reason the term was not used by placement agencies was that less than half of the children who rode the trains were in fact orphans, and as many as 25 percent had two living parents. Children with both parents living ended up on the trains ‚Äî or in orphanages ‚Äî because their families did not have the money or desire to raise them or because they had been abused or abandoned or had run away. And many teenage boys and girls went to orphan train sponsoring organizations simply in search of work or a free ticket out of the city. The term \\"orphan trains\\" is also misleading because a substantial number of the placed-out children didn't take the railroad to their new homes and some didn't even travel very far. The state that received the greatest number of children (nearly one-third of the total) was New York. Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania also received substantial numbers of children. For most of the orphan train era, the Children's Aid Society bureaucracy made no distinction between local placements and even its most distant ones. They were all written up in the same record books and, on the whole, managed by the same people. Also, the same child might be placed one time in the West and the next time ‚Äî if the first home did not work out ‚Äî in New York City. The decision about where to place a child was made almost entirely on the basis of which alternative was most readily available at the moment the child needed help.  The first Orphan Train  The first group of 45 children arrived in Dowagiac, Michigan, on October 1, 1854. The children had traveled for days in uncomfortable conditions. They were accompanied by E. P. Smith of the Children's Aid Society. Smith himself had let two different passengers on the riverboat from Manhattan adopt boys without checking their references. Smith added a boy he met in the Albany railroad yard ‚Äî a boy whose claim to orphanhood Smith never bothered to verify. At a meeting in Dowagiac, Smith played on his audience's sympathy while pointing out that the boys were handy and the girls could be used for all types of housework. In an account of the trip published by the Children's Aid Society, Smith said that in order to get a child, applicants had to have recommendations from their pastor and a justice of the peace, but it is unlikely that this requirement was strictly enforced. By the end of that first day, fifteen boys and girls had been placed with local families. Five days later, twenty-two more children had been adopted. Smith and the remaining eight children traveled to Chicago where Smith put them on a train to Iowa City by themselves where a Reverend C. C. Townsend, who ran a local orphanage, took them in and attempted to find them foster families. This first expedition was considered such a success that in January 1855 the society sent out two more parties of homeless children to Pennsylvania. Logistics of Orphan Trains Orphan train flyer Committees of prominent local citizens were organized in the towns where orphan trains stopped. These committees were responsible for arranging a site for the adoptions, publicizing the event, and arranging lodging for the orphan train group. These committees were also required to consult with the Children's Aid Society on the suitability of local families interested in adopting children. Brace's system put its faith in the kindness of strangers. Orphan train children were placed in homes for free and were expected to serve as an extra pair of hands to help with chores around the farm. Families expected to raise them as they would their natural-born children, providing them with decent food and clothing, a \\"common\\" education, and $100 when they turned twenty-one. Older children placed by The Children's Aid Society were supposed to be paid for their labors. Legal adoption was not required. According to the Children's Aid Society's \\"Terms on Which Boys are Placed in Homes,\\" boys under twelve were to be \\"treated by the applicants as one of their own children in matters of schooling, clothing, and training,\\" and boys twelve to fifteen were to be \\"sent to a school a part of each year.\\"Scheuerman, Dan. \\"Lost Children: Riders on the Orphan Train\\", Humanities, November/December 2007  Volume 28, Number 6 Representatives from the society were supposed to visit each family once a year to check conditions, and children were expected to write letters back to the society twice a year. There were only a handful of agents to monitor thousands of placements. Before they boarded the train, children were dressed in new clothing, given a Bible and placed in the care of Children's Aid Society agents who accompanied them west. Few children understood what was happening. Once they did, their reactions ranged from delight at finding a new family to anger and resentment at being placed out when they had relatives back home. Most children on the trains were white. An attempt was made to place non-English speakers with people who spoke their language. German- speaking Bill Landkamer rode an orphan train several times as a preschooler in the 1920s before being accepted by a German family in Nebraska. Babies were easiest to place, but finding homes for children older than 14 was always difficult because of concern that they were too set in their ways or might have bad habits. Children who were physically or mentally disabled or sickly were difficult to find homes for. Although many siblings were sent out together on orphan trains, prospective parents could choose to take a single child, separating siblings. Many orphan train children went to live with families that placed orders specifying age, gender, and hair and eye color. Others were paraded from the depot into a local playhouse, where they were put up on stage, thus the origin of the term \\"up for adoption.\\" According to an exhibit panel from the National Orphan Train Complex, the children \\"took turns giving their names, singing a little ditty, or 'saying a piece.\\" According to Sara Jane Richter, professor of history at Oklahoma Panhandle State University, the children often had unpleasant experiences. \\"People came along and prodded them, and looked, and felt, and saw how many teeth they had.\\" Press accounts convey the spectacle, and sometimes auction-like atmosphere, attending the arrival of a new group of children. Some ordered boys, others girls, some preferred light babies, others dark, and the orders were filled out properly and every new parent was delighted, reported The Daily Independent of Grand Island, NE in May 1912. They were very healthy tots and as pretty as anyone ever laid eyes on. Brace raised money for the program through his writings and speeches. Wealthy people occasionally sponsored trainloads of children. Charlotte Augusta Gibbs, wife of John Jacob Astor III, had sent 1,113 children west on the trains by 1884. Railroads gave discount fares to the children and the agents who cared for them.  Scope of the Orphan Train movement  The Children's Aid Society's sent an average of 3,000 children via train each year from 1855 to 1875. Orphan trains were sent to 45 states, as well as Canada and Mexico. During the early years, Indiana received the largest number of children. At the beginning of the Children's Aid Society orphan train program, children were not sent to the southern states, as Brace was an ardent abolitionist. By the 1870s, the New York Foundling Hospital and the New England Home for Little Wanderers in Boston all had orphan train programs of their own.  New York Foundling Hospital \\"Mercy Trains\\"  The New York Foundling Hospital was established in 1869 by Sister Mary Irene Fitzgibbon of the Sisters of Charity of New York as a shelter for abandoned infants. The Sisters worked in conjunction with Priests throughout the Midwest and South in an effort to place these children in Catholic families. The Foundling Hospital sent infants and toddlers to prearranged Roman Catholic homes from 1875 to 1914. Parishioners in the destination regions were asked to accept children, and parish priests provided applications to approved families. This practice was first known as the \\"Baby Train,\\" then later the \\"Mercy Train.\\" By the 1910s, 1,000 children a year were placed with new families.Dianne Creagh, \\"The Baby Trains: Catholic Foster Care and Western Migration, 1873-1929,\\" Journal of Social History (2012) 46#1 pp 197-218 online  Challenges faced by Orphan Train passengers and families  Linda McCaffery, a professor at Barton County Community College, explained the range of Orphan Train experiences: \\"Many were used as strictly slave farm labor, but there are stories, wonderful stories of children ending up in fine families that loved them, cherished them, [and] educated them.\\" Orphan train children faced obstacles ranging from prejudice of classmates because they were train children to feeling like outsiders in their families all their lives. Many rural people viewed the orphan train children with suspicion, as incorrigible offspring of drunkards and prostitutes. Criticisms of the orphan train movement focused on concerns that initial placements were made hastily, without proper investigation, and that there was insufficient follow-up on placements. Charities were also criticized for not keeping track of children placed while under their care. In 1883, Brace consented to an independent investigation. It found the local committees were ineffective at screening foster parents. Supervision was lax. Many older boys had run away. But its overall conclusion was positive. The majority of children under fourteen were leading satisfactory lives. Applicants for children were supposed to be screened by committees of local businessmen, ministers, or physicians, but the screening was rarely very thorough. Small-town ministers, judges, and other local leaders were often reluctant to reject a potential foster parent as unfit if he were also a friend or customer. Many children lost their identity through forced name changes and repeated moves. In 1996, Alice Ayler said, \\"I was one of the luckier ones because I know my heritage. They took away the identity of the younger riders by not allowing contact with the past.\\" Many children placed out west had survived on the streets of New York, Boston or other large eastern cities and generally they were not the obedient children many families expected. In 1880, a Mr. Coffin of Indiana editorialized, \\"Children so thrown out from the cities are a source of much corruption in the country places where they are thrown... Very few such children are useful.\\" Some placement locations charged that orphan trains were dumping undesirable children from the East on Western communities. In 1874, the National Prison Reform Congress charged that these practices resulted in increased correctional expenses in the West. Older boys wanted to be paid for their labor, sometimes asking for additional pay or leaving a placement to find a higher paying placement. It is estimated that young men initiated 80% of the placement changes. One of the many children who rode the train was Lee Nailling. Lee's mother died of sickness; after her death Lee's father could not afford to keep his children. Another orphan train child was named Alice Ayler. Alice rode the train because her single mother could not provide for her children; before the journey they lived off of \\"berries\\" and \\"green water.\\" Catholic clergy maintained that some charities were deliberately placing Catholic children in Protestant homes to change their religious practices. The Society for the Protection of Destitute Roman Catholic Children in the City of New York (known as the Protectory) was founded in 1863. The Protectory ran orphanages and place out programs for Catholic youth in response to Brace's Protestant-centered program. Similar charges of conversion via adoption were made concerning the placement of Jewish children. Not all orphan train children were true orphans, but were made into orphans by forced removal from their biological families to be placed out in other states. Some claimed this was a deliberate pattern intended to break up immigrant Catholic families. Some abolitionists opposed placements of children with Western families, viewing indentureship as a form of slavery. Orphan trains were the target of lawsuits, generally filed by parents seeking to reclaim their children. Suits were occasionally filed by a receiving parent or family member claiming to have lost money or been harmed as the result of the placement. The Minnesota State Board of Corrections and Charities reviewed Minnesota orphan train placements between 1880 and 1883. The Board found that while children were placed hastily and without proper investigation into their placements, only a few children were \\"depraved\\" or abused. The review criticized local committee members who were swayed by pressure from wealthy and important individuals in their community. The Board also pointed out that older children were frequently placed with farmers who expected to profit from their labor. The Board recommended that paid agents replace or supplement local committees in investigating and reviewing all applications and placements. A complicated lawsuit arose from a 1904 Arizona Territory orphan train placement in which the New York Foundling Hospital sent 40 Caucasian children between the ages of 18 months and 5 years to be indentured to Catholic families in an Arizona Territory parish. The families approved by the local priest for placement were identified in the subsequent litigation as \\"Mexican Indian.\\" Nuns escorting these children were unaware of the racial tension between local Anglo and Mexican groups, and placed Caucasian children with Mexican Indian families. A group of white men, described as \\"just short of a lynch mob,\\" forcibly took the children from the Mexican Indian homes and placed most of them with Anglo families. Some of the children were returned to the Foundling Hospital, but 19 remained with the Anglo Arizona Territory families. The Foundling Hospital filed a writ of habeas corpus seeking the return of these children. The Arizona Supreme Court held that the best interests of the children required that they remain in their new Arizona homes. On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court found that a writ of habeas corpus seeking the return of a child constituted an improper use of the writ. Habeas corpus writs should be used \\"solely in cases of arrest and forcible imprisonment under color or claim of warrant of law,\\" and should not be used to obtain or transfer custody of children. These events were well publicized at the time with newspaper stories titled \\"Babies Sold Like Sheep,\\" telling readers that the New York Foundling Hospital \\"has for years been shipping children in car-loads all over the country, and they are given away and sold like cattle.\\"  End of the Orphan Train movement  As the West was settled, the demand for adoptable children declined. Additionally, Midwestern cities such as Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis began to experience the neglected children problems that New York, Boston and Philadelphia had experienced in the mid-1800s. These cities began to seek ways to care for their own orphan populations. In 1895, Michigan passed a statute prohibiting out-of-state children from local placement without payment of a bond guaranteeing that children placed in Michigan would not become a public charge in the State. Similar laws were passed by Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri and Nebraska. Negotiated agreements between one or more New York charities and several western states allowed the continued placement of children in these states. Such agreements included large bonds as security for placed children. In 1929, however, these agreements expired and were not renewed as charities changed their child care support strategies. Lastly, the need for the orphan train movement decreased as legislation was passed providing in-home family support. Charities began developing programs to support destitute and needy families limiting the need for intervention to place out children.  Legacy of the program  Between 1854 and 1929, an estimated 200,000 American children traveled west by rail in search of new homes. The Children's Aid Society rated its transplanted wards successful if they grew into \\"creditable members of society,\\" and frequent reports documented the success stories. A 1910 survey concluded that 87 percent of the children sent to country homes had \\"done well,\\" while 8 percent had returned to New York and the other 5 percent had either died, disappeared or gotten arrested. Brace's notion that children are better cared for by families than in institutions is the most basic tenet of present-day foster care.  Organizations  National Orphan Train Complex dedication The Orphan Train Heritage Society of America, Inc. founded in 1986 in Springdale, AR preserves the history of the orphan train era. The National Orphan Train Complex in Concordia, KS is a museum and research center dedicated to the Orphan Train Movement, the various institutions that participated, and the children and agents who rode the trains. The museum is located at the restored Union Pacific Railroad Depot in Concordia which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Complex maintains an archive of riders' stories and houses a research facility. Services offered by the museum include rider research, educational material, and a collection of photos and other memorabilia.

Early life and education  Kahrs' parents are Wolfgang and Bringfriede Kahrs who were both senators in Bremen on the ticket of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. After visiting school in Bremen, Kahrs joined the Bundeswehr and became an officer. Later, he began to study German jurisprudence. During his university studies, Kahrs became a member of Wingolfs, a student fraternity, in Hamburg and was speaker of the organization from 1990 to 1992.

In 1992 Kahrs stood before trial because of the imputation of harassment against a female political rival in the \\"Jusos\\". He was sentenced to pay a penalty of 800 euros. In the 1998 elections, Kahrs was first elected to the Bundestag, representing the Hamburg Mitte constituency. During his first term between 1998 and 2002, Kahrs served on the Defence Committee. Since 2002, he has been a member of the Budget Committee and the Audit Committee. In addition, he joined the parliament‚Äôs Council of Elders in 2002, which ‚Äì among other duties ‚Äì determines daily legislative agenda items and assigns committee chairpersons based on party representation.

Club career=Early career Rankine began his career as a schoolboy at Manchester United, but was not offered a YTS contract and was released. He subsequently joined his hometown club Doncaster Rovers and progressed through their youth system, being part of the team that reached the 1988 FA Youth Cup final. Doncaster Rovers Rankine made his senior debut on 15 August 1987 in a 1‚Äì0 win over Grimsby Town in the Third Division. The club were relegated to the fourth tier that season, but Rankine had managed to become a regular member of the first-team squad. The following season, he was an ever-present, scoring 11 goals during the season. After two further seasons as a mainstay of the Doncaster midfield, he attracted interest from other clubs. Wolverhampton Wanderers He was eventually sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers of the Second Division for ¬£70,000 in January 1992. Rankine made his Wolves debut as a substitute on 1 February 1992 in a 1‚Äì0 win over Leicester City. Although not as much an automatic choice as at his previous club, Rankine still featured regularly, amassing 167 appearances in total (though scoring just once) for the club over a four-and-a-half-year stay. Preston North End By the start of the 1996‚Äì97 season he was no longer part of manager Mark McGhee's plans and was sold to Preston North End for ¬£100,000 in September 1996. Rankine went on to make more appearances for Preston than for any of his other clubs over a seven-year association. The club were newly promoted to the third tier at the time of his arrival, and he achieved a further promotion with them in the 1999‚Äì2000 season as champions. The following season saw him almost achieve Premier League football as he scored a late goal which helped them beat Birmingham City to reach the play-off final. After doing so he achieved legend status at North End and is nowadays looked upon by many Preston fans as a club hero. However, they lost 3‚Äì0 to Bolton Wanderers in that final. Sheffield United After Craig Brown had replaced David Moyes as Preston manager for the 2002‚Äì03 season, Rankine found his place under threat and he finished the campaign on loan at Sheffield United. This move offered him a second chance at promotion as United reached the play-off final, but Rankine again missed out on top-flight football as they lost to his former club Wolverhampton Wanderers (inflicting a second successive 3‚Äì0 final defeat on him). Despite this disappointment, Sheffield United retained Rankine's services, signing him permanently in July 2003. He remained at Bramall Lane for just one full season before his contract expired and he left for Tranmere Rovers. Tranmere Rovers Rankine's first season with Tranmere saw him again reach the play-offs but they lost their semi-final tie on penalties to Hartlepool United. He had planned to retire at the end of the campaign but decided to sign a one-year extension in the close season. His second season was more of a struggle, and he opted to have his contract terminated by mutual consent and retire before the season's conclusion after finding it tough to play as regularly aged 36. Rankine scored once during his spell at Tranmere, in a 2‚Äì1 Football League Trophy win over Lincoln City on 18 October 2005. After football In 2008 Rankine started working as a football agent. Personal life He is the uncle of footballer Michael Rankine, Danny Rose, and Mitch Rose who also play football professionally in England.

Selected products can then be studied individually. Fragment separators typically consist of a series of superconducting magnetic multipole elements. The thin target immediately before the separator allows the fragments produced through various reactions to escape the target material still at a very high velocity. The products are forward-focused because of the high velocity of the center-of-mass in the beam-target interaction, which allows fragment separators to collect a large fraction (in some cases nearly all) of the fragments produced in the target.

Position Whereas traditional criticisms of environmentalism come from the more conservative \\"right\\" of politics, leftist critiques of nature pioneered by postmodernist constructionism highlight the need to recognise \\"the other\\". The implicit assumption made by theorists like Wapner refer to it as a new \\"response to ecocriticism [which] would require critics to acknowledge the ways in which they themselves silence nature and then to respect the sheer otherness of the non-human world.\\" Criticism Critics argue that, by capturing the nonhuman world within its own conceptual domain, postmodern exerts precisely the urge toward mastery that it criticizes in modernity. Thus, postmodern cultural criticism deepens the modernist urge toward mastery by eliminating the ontological weight of the nonhuman world. \\"What else could it mean to assert that there is no such thing as nature?\\". The issue becomes an existentialist query about whether nature can exist in a humanist critique, and whether we can discern the \\"others'\\" views in relation to our actions on their behalf. This is referred to as the Wapner Paradox. See also David Demeritt's typology of the social construction of nature looks at the idea from several standpoints.

It is named for its resemblance to the sting of a scorpion, for which the Hindi name is bichuwa. The weapon was based on the maduvu, or horn dagger created in South India, and many bichuwa have blades which retain the shape of buffalo horns. Early examples of the bichuwa come from the medieval southern empire of Vijayanagara. Being relatively easy to make, the bichuwa has persisted into the 20th century as a decorative dagger.  Construction and use  The bichuwa usually has a narrow recurved blade and a simple looped handle which may be cut with chevrons. It generally measures just over 30 centimetres. The handle sometimes loops into a knuckleguard. The all-metal hilt is often cast in one piece. Medieval bichuwa from south India are typically decorated with the face of a protective yali (demon) on the hilt. Some have finials to the pommel or even protruding laterally as quillons or guards. A few bichuwa are forked or even double-bladed. The weapon's small size meant it was easily concealed in a sleeve or waist band. A bichuwa was often combined with a bagh naka, either with the claws being added to the hilt of the bichuwa, or the blade being added to one of the finger loops of the bagh nakha. The former type tended to be larger than the latter. This combination weapon, known as a bichuwa bagh naka, was used by the Maratha King Shivaji to assassinate Afzal Khan in the 17th century. Shivaji's weapon was named Bhawani or \\"life-giver\\", though some accounts suggest that this was the name of his sword.

The school is named after the Holy Isle of Lindisfarne, site of the medieval Celtic monastery and castle on the northeastern coast of England. The college was established on 14 April 1953, by the Herrick family. The founding roll of 33 students now comprises around 500 students. Roughly half the school students are full or weekly boarders. Its sister school, Iona College for girls, is situated in nearby Havelock North. Since 2000, the college has invested significantly in major renovation and new construction projects. Older buildings such as the homestead, dining hall, chapel, gymnasium, and music department have been modernised, and new facilities include the Lowe Family Performing Arts Centre. The current acting rector is Campbell Howlett. The college's overarching philosophy is based on 'four cornerstones of learning' ‚Äî academic excellence, cultural participation, sporting endeavour, and the Christian dimension. It focuses heavily on producing alumni with 'admirable' content of character, through its 'Good Man' programme. Scottish Heritage Lindisfarne places a major emphasis on its Scottish and Presbyterian heritage. This tradition began in accordance with the wishes of the Herrick family, who gifted the land on which the college stands for the creation of a school in 1953. Additionally, the college's founding rector, Rev. F. H. Robertson, was a prominent minister in the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand, and established a uniquely Presbyterian and Scottish dimension to the college. The college hosts an annual Burns supper, maintains an active pipe band, and hosts the annual Easter Highland Games for the Hawke's Bay region. The college's formal uniform includes the wearing of tartan kilts, and its social studies curriculum includes the mandatory learning of the school's Celtic heritage. Students are also required to learn the college hymn, the college song, and the college prayer. College Grounds=Campus Lindisfarne is situated on two separate sites in the suburb of Frimley, in Hastings. The main college campus is on 8 hectares, while a further 9 hectares is located nearby and divided into two sports venues called \\"The Farne\\" and \\"Ranui Fields.\\" The campus is centered around the original Herrick Family homestead, a three-storeyed late-19th Century farmhouse that has been substantially renovated to house the college's administration offices. The homestead adjoins an old tennis court area that has since evolved into the \\"Homestead Lawn.\\" The lawn provides the central feature of the college's gardens, edged by flower beds, native ferns, English trees and a stream. The boarding residences are also situated on the main campus, and are organised into year groups. A number of private residences are also situated on the college campus and house the rector, the deputy rector, the chaplain, and the boarding masters.Our Campus  Facilities. Lindisfarne College. Retrieved on 7 December 2016. Dibble Sculptures The college grounds are also home to three major works by renowned New Zealand sculptor Paul Dibble. The first sculpture, commissioned by the College Foundation in 2000, is a representation of the college's dual heritage, bearing engravings of the Celtic cross and per saltire Cross of St. Andrew along with iconic MƒÅori patterns. The second sculpture, commissioned in 2007, depicts a fish set below a bronze replica of the ruins of the medieval Lindisfarne Priory at Holy Isle. The most recent sculpture consists of a seven piece representation of the changing seasons, at the centre of which is a large heart ‚Äî a reference to the college's motto 'Highways in the Heart' ‚Äî engraved with the names of artists such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Banksy, and MƒÅori artist Ralph Hotere.  Te WhƒÅiti-Nui-A-Toi Programme  Lindisfarne has also developed a strong MƒÅori cultural dimension since the establishment of the Te WhƒÅiti-Nui-A-Toi Scholarship in 1972. The scholarship, which has historical connections to the MƒÅori Synod through the work of Presbyterian Missionaries to the NgƒÅi T≈´hoe people of the Te Urewera region, provides funding support for MƒÅori boys attending the college. Te WhƒÅiti-Nui-A-Toi scholars have also represented Lindisfarne at major cultural events, such as the Hawke's Bay Secondary Schools Cultural Festival and the Manu Korero speech competition. Sir Rodney Gallon served as de facto patron of the Te WhƒÅiti-Nui- A-Toi scholarship programme from 1972 until his death in 2012. All students are required to learn a haka of the local NgƒÅti Kahungunu iwi, which is performed at various sports and cultural events.  Joint Activities & Exchanges  Lindisfarne is located adjacent to Hastings Girls' High School, with which it has numerous joint musical ensembles, notably the Concord Symphonic Band. The college also produces annual theatrical productions, in conjunction with either Hastings Girls' High School, Iona College, or Woodford House. Lindisfarne has also had long-standing associations with Turakina Maori Girls' College and St Joseph's MƒÅori Girls' College through the kapa haka activities of Te WhƒÅiti-Nui-A-Toi Scholars attending the college. Annual sporting exchanges have been established between Lindisfarne and other Scottish-heritage boys' schools in New Zealand, including Scots College, Wellington, and Saint Kentigern College, Auckland. Additional sporting rivalries exist between Lindisfarne and Rathkeale College, Wanganui Collegiate School, and Napier Boys' High School. Houses Lindisfarne has an established house system with four houses: Aidan, Cuthbert, Oswald, and Durham. Boys whose fathers are alumni of the school are placed in the same house that their father was in. Brothers are usually placed in the same house as well, to create a sense of family within houses. Students participate in various inter-house activities during the course of the year, with the ultimate goal of winning the Gahan Shield. Each house is named after an aspect of the college's Celtic heritage: * Aidan - (Red) It is named after St. Aidan of Lindisfarne, founder of the monastery on the Holy Isle. * Cuthbert - (Black) It is named after St. Cuthbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne (685-687). * Oswald - (Blue) It is named after St. Oswald, King of Northumbria (634-642). * Durham - (Green) It is named after the Bishopric of Durham, in the cathedral of which the remains of King Oswald and St. Cuthbert are interred.  Funding  In January 2016 it was reported that Lindisfarne receives an annual average of $4000 per student in private donations, the highest of any state-integrated school in New Zealand. Between the period 2000-2014 the college received a total of $16,031,269 in private donations. As of 2017 the college reportedly charges $9189 per year for day students. Although this includes several voluntary components, the charges are bundled together as \\"consolidated fees.\\" College Rectors and Roll *1953-1954 ‚Äî Reverend F. H. Robertson *1955-1956 ‚Äî P. H.

It is usually served with kaymak, a kind of clotted cream. In Turkey it is considered a regional specialty of Afyonkarahisar. History Historically, as with other bread puddings, this recipe emerged as a way to utilize stale or day-old bread. For modern home cooks, it is a popular alternative to more demanding traditional desserts like baklava. It is served at iftar meals during Ramadan. Preparation In modern times, ekmek kadayifi is sold ready made. All the cook needs to do at home to prepare the dessert is to make the sugar syrup called ≈üerbet and top the finished dessert with kaymak cream or ice cream. To prepare the dessert from scratch with bread, first a piece of bread is carefully hollowed out to make a bread bowl. If the bread is too fresh it may be further dried in an oven. A dark caramel ≈üerbet is poured over the prepared bread. It is important to prepare the bread correctly to maximize absorption of the ≈üerbet. When the bread has fully absorbed the ≈üerbet it softens. The bread bowl can then be filled with ice cream before serving. The finished dessert is flipped upside down to make ice cream stuffed ekmek kadayif. Some recipes prepare it as a simple cake made with eggs, flour and sugar. First the eggs and sugar are whisked until the eggs are frothy, then the flour is mixed in. A little baking powder is added as a leavening agent. The cream filling for the cake is made with milk, cornstarch, flour, sugar and powdered Cr√®me Chantilly. When fully baked, the thin cake is cut in half like a layer cake. ≈ûerbet syrup is poured over the bottom layer and a layer of cream is spread between the two cake layers. The top layer is cut into slices and arranged on top of the cream. The remaining ≈üerbet syrup is poured over the assembled cake, which is garnished with ground pistachio and shredded coconut. The cake is left to set in the fridge for several hours before it is ready to be served.

Over the years the school population steadily increased as more and more parents began to choose Christian education for their children. In 2000, the school entered into an agreement with the Edmonton Public School Board, and now operates as an alternative program with EPSB. Millwoods Christian School has a strong theatre program and a well recognized learning environment. Every year, many high school students volunteer and raise money to travel to countries in need and serve for weeks at a time with the Millwoods Christian School service trip program.  Service Trip Program  MCS has been actively involved in serving others in their community and around the world by giving students the opportunity to enrol in a service trip program. This includes travelling to places like Belize, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, etc. Fundraising is a big part of joining a service trip. This is done with events such as a silent auction, doing bottle drives and the Taste of MCS; which gives the students a chance to sample different cultures of food.

IWRC began in California's Bay Area to share experiences and resources, and to \\"develop a professional organization through which North American rehabilitators could network and access information.\\"  History  In the 1970s, there was an intense urban growth and harm of natural habitat in the United States. In response to this phenomenon, formal wildlife rehabilitation organizations began forming across the country. These new programs demonstrated a lack of clear, professional standards of care and support networks primarily using a method based on trial and error. Although the facilities were growing rapidly in the United States, they were functioning in an isolated manner. The founders of IWRC wanted to create a professional association. Through this organization, wildlife rehabilitators could access reliable, science-based, and up-to-date information. They also sought to share the necessary resources ‚Äúto help improve the quality of care provided to injured wild animals‚Äù . Their main mission is to provide science-based education and resources to those who are certified as wildlife rehabilitators, as well as, the public who wishes to become certified. Mainly they seek to promote wildlife conservation and welfare .  Educational Programs  They provide various educational programs, all of which are science-based, to help the individuals learn more about wildlife rehabilitation or help them to become certified professionals . They offer classes similar to a traditional classroom setting, which was the first of its kind, launched in 1984 . The Basic Wildlife Rehabilitation two- day program includes various classes with lectures and labs. Topics covered include basic anatomy and physiology, handling and physical restraint, thermoregulation, stress, initial care and physical examination, nutrition and associated diseases, standards for housing, zoonoses, euthanasia criteria and release criteria. The content and criteria remains the same up to this day and has been delivered to multiple different countries. Classes are held by request about 15-20 times a year in various locations . The IWRC also offers online professional training. The new distance education program emerged in 2005 giving access to online lectures, discussions, and web-examinations . Another way the International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council provides information to rehabilitation scientists is through conferences. The first conference was held in 1977 . They continue to hold these conferences annually by offering science and research-based presentations with the addition of practical skill seminars. They finally offer the option of becoming an IWRC member in order to gain ultimate access to conferences, insights, further information, and to meet with colleagues near and far . The International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council offers all these various methods to get informed and train as a wildlife rehabilitator. Board of directors The IWRC contains a board of 13 directors who oversee all activities and concerns of the IWRC, most of whom hold a specific position within the board, be it president, treasurer, secretary, etc. Many of the members of the Board of Directors have grown up with a concern for wildlife and habitat conservation for many years, and continue this love in their respective homes/areas. Members of the board not only have university education, but many also hold degrees from Ivy League universities from around the world, also obtaining prestigious jobs working as veterinarians (such as Francisca Astorga) . These not only show the legitimacy of the organization, but the knowledge these individuals bring to the field. The current president of the IWRC is Lynn Miller, a Certified Wildlife Rehabilitator and native New Zealander. Miller attended McGill University in Quebec, ON, and continuing on to achieve her PhD. Her love of knowledge does not only stop there though, as she continues with research through Concordia University. Herself, along with the IWRC, is also involved in work with another group called Le Nichoir, another non-profit organization that focuses on the conservation, care, and public information regarding wild birds .  Certification  In order to become a CWR (Certified Wildlife Rehabilitator), one must be able to pass a test created by the IWRC to become one of few CWR throughout the world. This test ensures that those who are involved in wildlife rehabilitation throughout the world have the proper skills and knowledge to properly protect the earth‚Äôs environment. One is not required to be a member of the IWRC to become certified, it is merely an addition to ones experience and professionalism that is encouraged. The test itself is taken from a bank of over 12 000, resulting in personalized tests for each individual undergoing certification, which includes 50 questions that may be true/false, multiple choice, and/or matching . The test may be taken online, or in person with a proctor who is approved by the IWRC (this may include teachers, clergy members, and more). Topics included in the test include areas such as the use of field guides, habitat assessment, euthanasia, and the prevention of conflicts between humans and wildlife. To receive certification as a CWR, one must answer at least 38 questions correctly, if not, one is awarded a fail and is encouraged to retake the test . After two years have passed since taking the test, one‚Äôs certification is thus expired and one must retake the test to again have their certification. The IWRC prides itself on providing up to date, scientific-based information and guidelines regarding wildlife conservation, and without this two-year period many CWR would not be aware of new research in their field About Us.

Warren, commencing at this time as ‚Äújobbing‚Äù engineers, specializing in tool making and gear cutting. Extension of work After carrying out work of this nature for several years, the Company's production focus shifted to the manufacture of tools to service the motor trade which was then in its infancy. The business was gradually extended with the development of a number of production lines suited to automotive reconditioning equipment. In December 1930 the partnership was converted into a proprietary company. World War II At the outbreak of World War II the factory's resources were used to aid the war effort and apart from manufacturing its normal range of products, the company took a leading part in production of tools and gauges for military purposes and was largely responsible for the more important tooling associated with .303 ammunition. The company was next approached by the United States Government's Director of Machine Tools and Gauges and requested to undertake the manufacture of a range of ‚Äúself centering chucks‚Äù. These chucks had never been manufactured in Australia before and information regarding overseas manufacturing procedures was not available. Warren and Brown commenced an extensive design and tooling programme and after many initial problems made their first deliveries of chucks to Government in February, 1942. By 1949 the continuing business expansion stretched the company's financial resources to the limit and in May, 1949 Warren and Brown Pty Ltd became part of the Repco organization and with the added resources available the company expanded into the heavier equipment field, adding products such as clutch rebuilders, spring testers, boring bars and other machines to its range. In 1948, Warren and Brown took out patents on what has now become known as the ‚ÄúDual Signal‚Äù trip mechanism for their world- renowned range of torque wrenches. The first wrenches were released onto the market in 1949 and to this day still hold the major share of the Australian market despite an onslaught of cheap imports. As a result of a significant change in ownership and corporate direction by the parent Repco Group in 1985, Warren and Brown was finally purchased by five of its management team in 1986 and relocated to its present site in Maidstone. Renamed Warren and Brown and Staff, the company became a privately owned Proprietary Limited company. Under this structure the company has continued as a manufacturer and supplier of specialized tools to the automotive, industrial, electrical and electronic industries. When the company applied its electronics expertise to its long established clinical air pumps, this resulted in the first switch mode circuit being designed and patented in Australia. This circuit, which can operate on either 12Volt DC or 90 to 260Volts AC enabled suffers of asthma, emphysema, cystic fibrosis and other respiratory ailments to be fully mobile as the pump could operate in a car and aeroplane or from any domestic electricity system around the world. As a tool designer and manufacture. Warren and Brown were approached by Telecom Australia (Telstra) to design and produce coax cable stripping tools. This has led to the development of many other tools for Telstra and other major companies and has provided a vehicle for Warren and Brown to enter the telecommunications industry with their Optic Fibre Management System. Warren and Brown is established in export markets throughout the world with its traditional range of automotive tools and equipment. Global markets include the United Kingdom, Europe, Russia, the U.S. and Asia. The company changed its name from Warren and Brown and Staff to Warren and Brown Technologies in 1997.  Achievements  *Exertech Exercise Monitoring Equipment, in conjunction with Repco Research and the Australian Institute of Sport. *Electronic Switch Mode Circuit for Multivoltage Air Pumps. *World's first Cylinder Head machine. *World's first modular design Dynamic Wheel Balancer. *Development of Synchronized Valve Seat Honing System. *Development of tooling and methods to extrude fire-retardant plastics. *Development of factory service tools for Ford, GMH and Nissan.  Telecommunications  Through the Lightpaths brand Warren and Brown Technologies have continued to develop a range of telecommunications products through various Research & Development programs. Specialising in optic fiber management, distribution and termination Warren and Brown along with major telecommunications companies have developed new age FTTH solutions.

It is a whodunnit featuring the series detective Sir Henry Merrivale. Plot summary Elderly Dr. Luke Croxley narrates a story with a very old theme set against the English village of Lynmouth. Rita Wainwright is 38, \\"a mature beauty with a weakness for younger men\\". Her gentle husband, Alec, more than 20 years older, seems more interested in radio broadcasts of World War II news than in his wife's notorious affair with a handsome young American actor, Barry Sullivan. Rita and Barry decide to run away together but a radio performance of Romeo and Juliet apparently turns their minds to a romantic double suicide. After the broadcast, their twin lines of footprints lead up to the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean, and none return. When their bodies are found, though, it is found that both of them had been shot through the heart at very close range, \\"body range, with some small-calibre weapon\\". Sir Henry Merrivale is in the neighbourhood posing for a portrait by a local artist (in the garb of a Roman Senator), and agrees to investigate this baffling mystery, which he solves just in time to take his place in the House of Lords. Literary significance and criticism According to Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, \\"This is another tale in which Merrivale is loud and tantrum-y but tolerable, and the narration more continuous and sane than usual. But these merits are only relative. The circus atmosphere is still present. ... Setting and situation cannot fail to attract the reader; but by the end the multiplication of farfetched clues and the twists and double twists in the evidence exceed the limit, just like the horseplay by and about Sir Henry. As for detection properly so called, it is there but obscured by the foregoing.\\"Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig. A Catalogue of Crime.

The book covers the families' journey from Sursee to Le Havre, thence by sea to New York, and on by river to St. Louis in the form of a diary kept by Joseph Suppiger, Jr. Letters from New Switzerland to relatives in Switzerland tell about the land and culture encountered as well as the particular area settled: \\"But you still do not know what a heavenly area we have found in which to settle. ...[It is a] farm twenty-seven miles east of St. Louis, consisting mostly of woods,\\" purchased for \\"the exceedingly low price of nineteen hundred dollars cash\\" (p. 135).

The area is where the renowned Topkapƒ± Palace and G√ºlhane Park stand. Sarayburnu is included in the historic areas of Istanbul, added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1985.UNESCO  Historic Areas of Istanbul History The first settlement on the Sarayburnu goes back to Neolithic, c. 6600 BC. The settlement lasted for almost a millennium before being inundated by the rising level of the sea; however, it might have been moved further inland. The artifacts from this settlement recovered during excavations display some of the distinct features of other artifacts found in other excavations in northwestern Turkey. Another settlement on the Sarayburnu, named Lygos, was founded by Thracian tribes between the 13th and 11th centuries BC, along with the neighbouring Semistra, which Pliny the Elder had mentioned in his historical accounts. Only a few walls and substructures belonging to Lygos have survived to date, near the location where the famous Topkapƒ± Palace now stands. During the period of ancient Byzantium, the Acropolis used to stand where the Topkapƒ± Palace stands today. According to a legend, in 667 BC ancient Greek settlers from Megara (near Athens) under the command of King Byzas established Byzantium at the Sarayburnu. Previously, in 685 BC, the Megarans had established Chalcedon (present-day Kadƒ±k√∂y) on the Anatolian shore, across the Bosporus. Actually the oldest settlements in present-day Istanbul are found on the Anatolian side; such as the Fikirtepe mound which dates from the Chalcolithic period (Copper Age), with artifacts dating from 5500-3500 BC. In nearby Kadƒ±k√∂y (ancient Chalcedon), a large port settlement dating from the Phoenicians (which predates the Megaran settlement) has been discovered. In antiquity there were two natural harbours in the area close to Sarayburnu where the present-day Sirkeci and Emin√∂n√º quarters stand (the harbours of Prosphorion and Neorion, which scooped into the coastline of the Golden Horn.) Because of this formation, the point of Sarayburnu was more conspicuous than it is today. In later periods the area was the convergence point for the Sea Walls of the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara. In the Byzantine period, the area was known in Greek as Hagios Demetrios. During the railway construction of the late Ottoman period, in 1871, the city walls of the Sarayburnu area were partially demolished, but they are still intact in some areas - especially close to the Topkapƒ± Palace, which was built in the 15th century for the Ottoman Sultans. The notable G√ºlhane Park is located right next to the palace.

McKay was born in Huntsville, Utah Territory, the son of David McKay and Jennette Evans. McKay's older brother was David O. McKay, who would become the ninth president of the LDS Church. McKay ca 1920 After graduating from the University of Utah in 1899, McKay traveled to Switzerland and Germany as an LDS Church missionary. During his mission, he was president of the Frankfurt Conference of the church for three months. After returning to Utah, McKay taught at the Weber Academy and the Agricultural College of Utah. Later he became the superintendent of the Weber County schools. From 1909 to 1912, McKay returned to Europe as the president of the church's Swiss‚ÄìGerman Mission. He also was the mission president of the Swiss‚ÄìAustrian Mission from 1927 until the Anschluss in 1938. During the Second World War, McKay was, in theory, the mission president over all German-speaking areas of Europe, although he resided in Salt Lake City at the time. In 1918, McKay was elected to the Utah House of Representatives as the representative for Weber County. He served one term, in the 13th Utah State Legislature which met from 1919 to 1921. McKay then served in the Utah Senate in 1921 and 1923Historical Listing of Utah State Legislators Prior to his call as a general authority, McKay was a president of the Ogden Stake of the church. In 1941, he became one of the first five men appointed to the newly created position of Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In 1951, he witnessed his brother's promotion to the presidency of the church. Thomas E. McKay served as an Assistant to the Twelve until his death in Salt Lake City at the age of 82. McKay was married to Fawn Brimhall and was the father of five children. McKay's daughter, Fawn M. Brodie, was a biographer and professor of history at UCLA who was eventually excommunicated for portraying Joseph Smith as a fraudulent genius in her 1945 work No Man Knows My History.

Hot Creek, starting as Mammoth Creek, is a stream in Mono County of eastern California, in the Western United States. It is within the Inyo National Forest. Course=Mammoth Creek The creek begins its course in the eastern Sierra Nevada named as Mammoth Creek. It originates as an outflow of Twin Lakes, just south of Mammoth Mountain and above the town of Mammoth Lakes. The stream is primarily sourced from melted snow water at above sea level. It is quite cold, rarely being above . Hot Creek As Mammoth Creek leaves the Sierra and flows east into the Long Valley Caldera it is joined by warmer water from geothermal springs at the Hot Creek State Fish Hatchery. From this confluence the stream is named Hot Creek, though its water temperature seldom exceeds until it reaches Hot Creek Gorge, east of Mammoth Lakes. In the Hot Creek Gorge, numerous hot springs near and in the stream bed add hot water into the stream. Its mouth is at the confluence with the Owens River upstream from Crowley Lake. Ecology The springs near Hot Creek host one of the two known Tui chub populations of the endangered Owens tui chub species. The Long Valley Observatory of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a volcano observatory, monitors spring activity, water temperatures and chemistry, and stream flow, as well as the caldera volcanic activity. Hot Creek hydrothermal system USGS map of the Mono Basin area, showing the Long Valley Caldera (click to see detail). In hydrothermal systems, the circulation of ground water is driven by a combination of topography and geothermal heat sources. The system in the Long Valley Caldera is recharged primarily from snowmelt in the highlands around the western and southern rims of the caldera. The meltwater infiltrates to depths of a few kilometers (or miles), where some is heated to at least by hot rock near the Inyo craters. The heated water, kept from boiling by high pressure, still has lower density than cold water, and it rises along steeply inclined fractures to depths of . It then flows eastward through rock layers to hydrothermal vent discharge points at the surface along Hot Creek and around Crowley Lake. The water temperature declines eastward because of heat loss and mixing with cold water, and in the springs near Crowley Lake temperatures are at only about . The springs in Hot Creek all emerge along a stream section between two faults and discharge a total of about 8.5 cubic feet per second (about 240 liters per second) of hot water. This water flow represents nearly 70 percent of the total heat discharged by all thermal springs in Long Valley Caldera. The thermal springs farther east all discharge less water and at lower temperatures. The larger and more vigorous springs discharge from fractures in the volcanic rock in the gorge. Rock fracturing happens because the thermal area lies within a region of frequent earthquakes and active uplift of the ground. When fractures become sealed by mineral deposition, spring discharge and temperature decline. When new fractures develop or sealed fractures reopen, spring discharge and temperatures can increase suddenly. Access The Hot Creek Gorge area of Hot Creek is managed by the U.S. Inyo National Forest as a geologic interpretive site and recreation area. It is popular for fishing, swimming, hiking, bird watching, and photography activities. Dangers and recent activity Fumarole‚Äîsteam vent beside Hot Creek, in the Hot Creek Gorge. Hot Creek in the Hot Creek Gorge section can harbor dangers as the locations, discharge rates, and temperatures of springs often change. The changes can be sudden and dangerous to unprepared visitors (especially if entering beyond walkways and fences). Since May 2006, springs in and near the most popular swimming areas have been geysering or intermittently spurting very hot, sediment-laden water as high as above the stream surface. At times this geysering activity is vigorous enough to produce \\"popping\\" sounds audible from hundreds of feet away. The geysering usually lasts a few seconds and occurs at irregular intervals, with several minutes between eruptions. Fumaroles, or steam vents, are also located in the gorge. They can occur in the ground beyond the creek bed. The unpredictability of this hazardous spring activity led the U.S. Forest Service to close parts of the Hot Creek Gorge in June 2006, Inyo National Forest Press Release and the closure has remained in effect as of February 2016. Hot Creek Gorge was a filming location in the 1969 film True Grit, as well as the 1960 film North to Alaska also starring John Wayne, the 1966 Steve McQueen film Nevada Smith, and the 1971 film Shoot Out with Gregory Peck, which also starred True Grit's Jeff Corey.

Nestucca Bay National Wildlife Refuge is a U.S. National Wildlife Refuge on Oregon's coast. It lies in southern Tillamook County, on the state's northern coast. It is one of six National Wildlife Refuges comprising the Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex and supports one tenth of the world's dusky Canada goose population. The refuge contains at least seven types of habitat, including tidal marsh, tidal mudflats, grassland, woodland, pasture, forested lagg‚Äîa transition between raised peat bog and mineral soil‚Äîand freshwater bogs, including the southernmost coastal Sphagnum bog habitat on the Pacific Coast. The Sphagnum bog provides habitat for many interesting and unusual species, such as the insect-eating sundew plant and the bog cranberry. Scientists have discovered many layers of sand and peat under Neskowin Marsh indicating a long history of tsunami activity which carries sand from the coastal sand dunes. These might be the best record of tsunami activity within the Cascadia subduction zone. Chinook and coho salmon, coastal cutthroat trout and steelhead are all native to the Nestucca Bay and River system. November through April, the refuge‚Äôs short grass pastures provide winter habitats for the previously mentioned dusky Canada goose and the Aleutian cackling goose. Notable winged residents include a variety of migrating shorebirds, peregrine falcons and bald eagles. The refuge was established in 1991, and is on Nestucca Bay at the confluence of the Nestucca and Little Nestucca rivers, ranging 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 km) south of Pacific City. Across the bay to the west is Nestucca Spit and Robert W. Straub state parks. The refuge is closed to all public use, except during two special events: one in February and one in October. A viewing area is planned for construction, probably in 2008.

It is a relatively new diagnosis in the field of autism. It was named after Hans Asperger (1906‚Äì80), who was an Austrian psychiatrist and pediatrician. An English psychiatrist, Lorna Wing, popularized the term \\"Asperger's syndrome\\" in a 1981 publication; the first book in English on Asperger syndrome was written by Uta Frith in 1991 and the condition was subsequently recognized in formal diagnostic manuals later in the 1990s.  Discovery of autistic psychopathy =Hans Asperger Hans Asperger was director of the University of Vienna Children's Clinic. As a result, he spent most of his professional life in Vienna. Throughout Asperger's career, he was also a pediatrician, medical theorist, and medical professor. His works were published largely in German. He is most well known for his work with mental disorders, especially those in children. As a child, Asperger appeared to have exhibited some features of the very condition named after him, such as social remoteness and talent in language. Asperger's research Asperger's 1940 work, Autistic psychopathy in childhood, found that four of the 200 children studied had difficulty with integrating themselves socially. Although their intelligence levels appeared normal, the children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Their verbal communication was either disjointed or overly formal, and their all-absorbing interest in a single topic dominated their conversations. Asperger named the condition \\"autistic psychopathy\\", and described it as primarily marked by social isolation.National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) (July 31, 2007). Asperger Syndrome Fact Sheet. Retrieved 24 August 2007. Asperger described those patients as like \\"little professors\\" who talked about their interests at great length, and believed the individuals he described would be capable of exceptional achievement and original thought later in life. Asperger's paper defended the value of high-functioning autistic individuals, writing \\"We are convinced, then, that autistic people have their place in the organism of the social community. They fulfill their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, and we are talking of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers.\\" However, he also wrote concerning his other cases, \\"Unfortunately, in the majority of cases the positive aspects of autism do not outweigh the negative ones.\\" A Soviet child psychiatrist, Grunya Sukhareva, described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926.  Relationship to Kanner's work  Two subtypes of autism were described between 1943 and 1944 by two Austrian researchers working independently‚ÄîAustrian-born Asperger and child psychiatrist Leo Kanner (1894‚Äì1981). Kanner emigrated to the United States in 1924; he described a similar syndrome in 1943, known as \\"classic autism\\" or \\"Kannerian autism\\", characterized by significant cognitive and communicative deficiencies, including delayed or absent language development. Reprint (1968) Acta Paedopsychiatr 35 (4): 100‚Äì36. . Kanner's descriptions were influenced by the developmental approach of Arnold Gesell, while Asperger was influenced by accounts of schizophrenia and personality disorders. Asperger's frame of reference was Eugen Bleuler's typology, which Christopher Gillberg has described as \\"out of keeping with current diagnostic manuals\\", adding that Asperger's descriptions are \\"penetrating but not sufficiently systematic\\". Asperger was unaware of Kanner's description published a year before his; the two researchers were separated by an ocean and a raging war, and Asperger's descriptions were unnoticed in the United States. During his lifetime, Asperger's work, in German, remained largely unknown outside the German-speaking world. Coinage According to Ishikawa and Ichihashi in the Japanese Journal of Clinical Medicine, the first author to use the term Asperger's syndrome in the English-language literature was the German physician, Gerhard Bosch. Between 1951 and 1962, Bosch worked as a psychiatrist at Frankfurt University. In 1962, he published a monograph detailing five case histories of individuals with PDD Bosch G (1962). Der fr√ºhkindliche Autismus - eine klinische und ph√§nomenologisch-anthropologische. Untersuchung am Leitfaden der Sprache. Berlin: Springer. that was translated into English eight years later,Bosch G (1970). Infantile autism ‚Äì a clinical and phenomenological anthropological investigation taking language as the guide. Berlin: Springer. becoming one of the first to establish German research on autism, and attracting attention outside the German-speaking world. Lorna Wing coined the term Asperger's syndrome in 1976 and is also credited with widely popularizing the term in the English-speaking medical community in her February 1981 publication of a series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms. Wing also placed AS on the autism spectrum, although Asperger was uncomfortable characterizing his patient on the continuum of autistic spectrum disorders. She chose \\"Asperger's syndrome\\" as a neutral term to avoid the misunderstanding equated by the term autistic psychopathy with sociopathic behavior. Wing's publication effectively introduced the diagnostic concept into American psychiatry and renamed the condition as Asperger's; however, her accounts blurred some of the distinctions between Asperger's and Kanner's descriptions because she included some mildly retarded children and some children who presented with language delays early in life. Early studies The first systematic studies appeared in the late 1980s in publications by Tantam (1988) in the UK, Gillberg and Gilbert in Sweden (1989), and Szatmari, Bartolucci and Bremmer (1989) in North America. The diagnostic criteria for AS were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989; Szatmari also proposed criteria in 1989. Asperger's work became more widely available in English when Uta Frith, an early researcher of Kannerian autism, translated his original paper in 1991. AS became a distinct diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the 10th published edition of the World Health Organization‚Äôs diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as Asperger's Disorder. When Hans Asperger observed the autistic like symptoms and behaviors in boys through their social and communication skills, many professionals felt like Asperger's syndrome was just a less severe form of autism. Uta Frith was one of these professionals who had this opinion. She was a professor at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience of University College London, and was also an editor of Autism and Asperger Syndrome. She said that individuals with Asperger's had a \\"dash of autism\\". She was one of the first scientists who recognized autism and related disorders as the result of a condition of the brain instead of the outcome of detached parenting. Contemporary Less than two decades after the widespread introduction of AS to English-speaking audiences, there are hundreds of books, articles and websites describing it; prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS recognized as an important subgroup. However, questions remain concerning many aspects of AS; whether it should be a separate condition from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study. The diagnostic validity of Asperger syndrome is tentative, there is little consensus among clinical researchers about the usage of the term \\"Asperger's syndrome\\", and there are questions about the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. It is likely that the definition of the condition will change as new studies emerge and it will eventually be understood as a multifactorial heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder involving a catalyst that results in prenatal or perinatal changes in brain structures. There is uncertainty regarding the gender gap between males and females with AS. A person with Asperger's is often remarked as possessing masculine traits like emotional distance from the inability to empathize, and far more boys than girls are diagnosed with Asperger's. Most studies on the syndrome were derived from research on males, neglecting specific attention to females with AS who often go misdiagnosed. For the most part, studies on girls with Asperger's are anecdotal. Changes in DSM-5 In 1994, Asperger's Syndrome was added to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). The DSM-V made a new, broad diagnosis in 2013 of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This category contains the previous individual diagnoses of Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome, and other related developmental disorders. ASD is rated on levels of severity on a scale ranging from severe, through moderate, to mild based on clinical presentation. The levels are determined by the amount of support the individual requires. Due to the change, individuals who were previously diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome were re-diagnosed within the umbrella of ASD due to the DSM revision.

This includes the Phoenix area and the neighboring urbanized area in Pinal County, containing the Town of Florence and City of Maricopa. When MAG was formed in 1967, the elected officials recognized the need for long-range planning and policy development on a regional scale. They realized that many issues such as transportation, air quality and human services affected residents beyond the borders of their individual jurisdictions. MAG is the designated Metropolitan planning organization (MPO) for transportation planning in the Maricopa County region. Additionally, beginning in 1973, MAG was also designated by the Governor of the State of Arizona to serve as the principal planning agency for the region in a number of other areas, including air quality, water quality and solid waste management. In addition, through an Executive Order from the Governor, MAG develops population estimates and projections for the region.  Purpose  Apache Junction, while being located mostly in Pinal County is represented in MAG, as well as other cities that extend into neighboring counties. MAG is based on the principle that cities, towns, counties, and Native American Communities should exercise the basic initiative and leadership and should have the primary responsibility for addressing those local problems and needs which require action on an area-wide or regional basis. The Articles of Incorporation for MAG state that the association was formed to do the following: * Provide a forum for discussion and study of regional problems of mutual interest to the governments in the region. * Ensure, through cooperation and the pooling of common resources, maximum efficiency and economy in governmental operations, which will provide every citizen with the utmost value for every dollar. * Identify and comprehensively plan for the solution of regional problems requiring multicity, town and county cooperation. * Facilitate agreements among the governmental units for specific projects or other interrelated developmental actions or for the adoption of common policies with respect to problems that are common to its members. * Attain the greatest degree of intergovernmental cooperation possible in order to prepare for future growth and development of the region.

Biography Little is known of Pheretima's life before or during her marriage. She was of Dorian Greek origin, and Herodotus states that her father was also called Battus. She married Battus sometime before he became king in 550 BC. They had two children: a son, the future king Arcesilaus III and a daughter, Ladice who married the Egyptian Pharaoh Amasis II. Reign of Arcesilaus When Battus died in 530 BC, Arcesilaus became king. In 525 BC, Arcesilaus made an alliance with King Cambyses II of Persia. About 518 BC, Arcesilaus demanded the return of the monarchical power his ancestors had possessed before his father's reform of the Cyrenaean constitution. This triggered a civil struggle in which Arcesilaus was defeated, and he and his mother were forced to leave Cyrenaica. Arcesilaus went to Samos, while Pheretima went to the court of King Euelthon in Salamis, Cyprus. While her son tried to recruit supporters in Samos, promising the men land in Cyrenaica, Pheretima asked Euelthon to give her an army to return to Cyrenaica. Euelthon refused to do so, but gave her various fine presents instead. Failing in her mission, Pheretima returned to Cyrenaica. Arcesilaus, however, recruited an army in Samos, returned with it to Cyrenaica, and retook his position. Arcesilaus murdered and exiled his political opponents, a decision which Pheretima probably influenced. Arcesilaus‚Äô supporters received their promised land but they feared a backlash for their actions and ignored the oracle‚Äôs advice not to harm the Cyrenaean citizens. Regency and later life Arcesilaus left Cyrene for the Cyrenaean town of Barca, and Pheretima ruled the city in his stead. Arcesilaus and his father-in-law were murdered in the Barcaean marketplace by exiled Cyrenaean nobles exacting revenge. When Pheretima heard of this, she went to Arysandes, the Persian governor of Egypt, to seek assistance in avenging the death of her son, claiming it was Arcesilaus' friendship with the Persian king that caused his murder. Arysandes pitied Pheretima and gave her Egypt‚Äôs army and navy to command. Before she left for Egypt, Arysandes sent a herald to Barca to ask who murdered Arcesilaus. The Barcaeans replied that they were all responsible for Arcesilaus‚Äô death. When the herald returned to Egypt with this answer, the army marched with Pheretima to Barca. They called upon those Barcaeans responsible for the murder to surrender, but the Barcaeans refused, and the subsequent siege lasted for nine months. Both the Persians and the Barcaeans lost many men. Amasis, the commander of the Persian infantry, changed tactics once he realized that Barca could not be taken by force. He devised a plan to lure the Barcaeans out of the town based on a false offer to discuss an armistice. Amasis ordered his soldiers to dig a large trench in front of the city covered with wooden planks and earth in order to catch them. Amasis then invited the Barcaeans for a meeting and they came. The Barcaeans accepted the offer of ending the hostilities in exchange for a fair sum paid to the Persian king. The Barcaeans agreed, and opened the city gates. When the Barcaeans marched out of the city to accept the terms, they fell into the trap. Pheretima ordered the Barcaean wives‚Äô breasts to be cut off, and gave the rest of the Barcaeans to the Persians as slaves. The Barcaeans were resettled by King Darius I of Persia in Bactria, and named their settlement Barca. Pheretima was successful in avenging her son by punishing the Barcaeans. She returned to Egypt, and gave the army back to the governor. While in Egypt, Pheretima contracted a contagious parasitic skin disease, and died in late 515 BC. With her death Cyrenaean independence ceased. Her grandson Battus IV became king, but Cyrenaica became a vassal state of the Persian Empire.

The New Zealand Government bought full ownership of TEAL in 1961 and the airline was renamed Air New Zealand in 1965. New Zealand's domestic airline, National Airways Corporation (NAC), was merged with Air New Zealand in 1978. Air New Zealand was privatised in 1989 but in 2001 the New Zealand Government took up 80% ownership in return for injecting $885 million after the airline ran into financial difficulty. In November 2013, the National Government sold down its share in Air New Zealand from 73% to 53% as part of its controversial asset sales programme. Tasman Empire Airways Limited Interior of a preserved TEAL Short Solent flying boat The airline was established as TEAL (Tasman Empire Airways Limited) on 26 April 1940. Its first flight was on 30 April 1940, with Short Empire flying boat ZK-AMA Aotearoa carrying ten passengers from Auckland to Sydney. It took around 7 hours 30 minutes to travel the 1,345 miles. TEAL's first annual report, dated 31 March 1941, revealed that 130 trans-Tasman flights had been completed, 174,200 miles flown and 1,461 passengers carried, with a profit of ¬£31,479. During World War II TEAL undertook several special charter and reconnaissance flights to New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Hawaii to assist the war effort. In June 1944 TEAL crossed the Tasman Sea for the 1,000th time. After World War II TEAL re-equipped, initially with Short Sandringham and later with Short Solent flying boats, and a former Royal New Zealand Air Force PBY Catalina also being used for survey flights. TEAL's initial schedule of two weekly flights from Auckland to Sydney was soon expanded with departures from Wellington, and flights to Fiji were also added during the early years. In 1953 the Australian Government bought 50% of TEAL, with the New Zealand Government buying the rest. In 1954 TEAL added Douglas DC-6s from the defunct British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines (BCPA) to its fleet, and these replaced the outdated flying boats on most international services. The flying boat services ended in 1960 when Tahiti's airport opened. TEAL operated services between Auckland and Fiji to replace BCPA's service. In 1955 TEAL made its 10,000th trans-Tasman crossing. In 1959 TEAL again changed its fleet, replacing the DC-6s with Lockheed L-188 Electra IIs. The turboprop aircraft was capable of carrying 71 passengers at nearly 400 miles per hour, and reduced the Auckland to Sydney flying time to 3 hours 50 minutes. In 1961 the New Zealand Government bought the Australian Government's half share, and on 1 April 1965 the airline was renamed Air New Zealand. First jets Air New Zealand Lockheed L-188 Electra departing Sydney for Wellington in 1970. Air New Zealand Douglas DC-8 at Wellington Airport in 1980 DC-8 On 23 September 1963 Air New Zealand signed a contract with Douglas Aircraft Company to purchase three DC-8-52 jet airliners. The first DC-8 arrived at Auckland on 20 July 1965, coinciding with the opening of Air New Zealand's jet base at the airport. The remaining two DC-8s arrived on 12 August and 22 September of that year and the inaugural jet service was a flight from Christchurch to Sydney on 3 October. The range of the jets enabled Air New Zealand to commence services to the United States and Asia for the first time ‚Äì on 14 December the first Auckland to Los Angeles service took off, via Nadi and Honolulu. Services from Auckland to Hong Kong via Manila and Singapore followed in early 1966. A service to Tokyo via Nadi started in 1980. On 4 July, 1966, one of the DC-8s was written off when it crashed during a routine training flight at Auckland Airport. While the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff, the number four (outer starboard) engine was throttled back to simulate an engine failure. However, the rapid movement of the throttle level needed to achieve this caused an inertia which resulted in the lever entering the reverse thrust setting. This meant that the airspeed necessary to gain control of the aircraft was never reached, and the starboard wing tip impacted the ground causing the DC-8 to cartwheel along the runway for several hundred yards. Two of the five crew died. Early in 1968 two more DC-8-52s were ordered, the first arriving on 29 January and the second on 28 February; these had the same seating layout as the earlier planes but had slightly more powerful engines. A sixth DC-8 was leased from United Airlines in November 1970 and purchased in July 1971. A seventh and final DC-8 was purchased from United Airlines, this one in October 1971. DC-10 Douglas DC-10 at London Heathrow in 1977 while on hire to British Airways. This particular aircraft, ZK-NZP, crashed into Mount Erebus. Having considering the DC-8 Super Sixties and the Lockheed L-1011, Air New Zealand ordered eight Douglas DC-10-30s, the first of which arrived on 27 January 1973. The DC-10s introduced a new paint scheme, with a koru featuring on the tail in the style of a Maori waka (canoe) stern post instead of the previously displayed Southern Cross; this scheme spread to the DC-8s during 1973.Air New Zealand Australian Transport September 1974 page 7 The longer range of the DC-10 opened up routes to Asia and eliminated the stop at Manila on the Auckland to Hong Kong route in 1975. As well as expanding trans-Pacific services. The first service to Perth was started in 1980. In 1979 the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 led to a global grounding of all DC-10s, stranding hundreds of passengers on both sides of Air New Zealand's Los Angeles‚ÄìAuckland route. The airline chartered a Pan Am Boeing 747 to transport stranded passengers and to keep a shuttle service open. The airline's two remaining DC-8s maintained a trans-tasman shuttle service along with its single international standard equipped Boeing 737-200, ZK-NAR. The decision not to take up NAC's purchase rights of the trans-tasman capable Boeing 727-200 had come back to haunt the airline. With no DC-8 replacement in sight Air New Zealand began looking for a mid-sized wide bodied jet and ordered the Boeing 767-200ER in 1983. Merger with NAC National Airways Corporation Lockheed Lodestar \\"Kotare\\", inherited from Union Airways Boeing 737s in hybrid Air New Zealand and National Airways Corporation livery at Wellington Airport in 1980 In 1947 a domestic competitor appeared in the form of the Government-owned National Airways Corporation (NAC), formed when the New Zealand government nationalised Union Airways and a number of other smaller operators. NAC was initially equipped with de Havilland Dragon Rapides, de Havilland Fox Moths, Douglas DC-3s, Lockheed Electras and Lockheed Super Electras. In the late 1940s NAC also provided international services to nearby South Pacific countries using converted ex Royal New Zealand Air Force Short Sunderlands. These were later supplemented by de Havilland Herons, Vickers Viscounts, Fokker Friendships and ultimately Boeing 737s. In 1972 NAC purchased a freight subsidiary, Straits Air Freight Express, which operated Bristol Freighters and Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy freighters. On 1 April 1978 the domestic airline NAC was absorbed into Air New Zealand. Although both airlines had worked closer together during the 1970s, sharing aircraft etc., it was felt that NAC was threatening the airline. Qantas was feeling out a domestic partner in New Zealand and had NAC in its sights. When NAC announced plans to purchase the Boeing 727-200 to increase capacity, and wanted to reapply for some of its Pacific Island routes, Air New Zealand objected and applied pressure to the New Zealand Government that one airline would best serve the nation's interest. The relaunched Air New Zealand used the NAC NZ prefix for domestic flight numbers and the Air New Zealand TEAL TE prefix for international flights until October 1990, when NZ became universal. The order for the Boeing 727-200s was cancelled, and Air New Zealand decided to instead purchase more Boeing 737-200s. It was a decision that would come back to haunt the airline as it would not have a mid-sized aircraft to support the DC-10s when the last DC-8s were due to retire in 1981. Mount Erebus disaster On 28 November 1979 Air New Zealand flight 901, a scheduled sightseeing flight over Antarctica, crashed into Mount Erebus. The Douglas DC-10-30 disintegrated on impact killing all 237 passengers aboard as well as the 20 crewmembers. This remains New Zealand's deadliest disaster. 1970s Female ANZ airline stewards won an important victory in 1979 when the ombudsman declared that the airline was blatantly discriminating against them by denying them equal promotion and pay raise opportunities with their male counterparts. The airline and the union representing the airline employees had been unsympathetic to the females plight ‚Äì one complaining female steward had her house shot at by an unidentified gunman ‚Äì but the ruling of the ombudsman (who is an extremely powerful figure in NZ) ensured that the discrminatory practices against the female stewards were ended. 1980s In 1981 Air New Zealand ordered its first wide-bodied Boeing type; the Boeing 747-219 was delivered, starting the replacement of the DC-10s. The DC-10s were leased out, the last service being in 1983, and all were sold by the end of 1986. In 1982 the first Air New Zealand flight to London in its own right (via Papeete and Los Angeles) took place. Air New Zealand was now a global airline. By 1988, the airline was operating weekly roundtrip Boeing 747 service between Auckland and London via Dallas/Fort Worth.http://www.timetableimages.com, 27 March 1988 Air New Zealand timetable In 1985 the first Boeing 767-200s were delivered. This type filled the medium range and payload gap vacated by the DC-8 and DC-10s. This allowed the airline to service the trans-Tasman route with a more intensive frequency to the major capitals not allowed by the larger Boeing 747s. Flights to Perth also used the aircraft. The Boeing 767 was also used for main trunk domestic services. Air New Zealand, along with Qantas helped to pioneer Extended range, Twin engine, Operations ETOPS. This allowed use of the efficient Boeing 767 over long range water routes. Originally the 767s were to stay within two hours flying time of an acceptable airport but this extended to three and even four hours. (The ETOPS rating is applied to individual aircraft, not the type in general. Today all twin engine commercial types can be rated to ETOPS standard, usually as part of a 'new aircraft' program such as the Embraer E-190.) Air New Zealand Boeing 777-200ER lands at London Heathrow Airbus A320 at Rarotonga Airport 1989 onwards=New ownership and stock-exchange listing In October 1989 the Government of New Zealand privatised Air New Zealand, selling to a consortium headed by Brierley Investments. Brierley retained 65%, with 30% to be sold to the New Zealand public, staff, and institutional investors ‚Äî Qantas with 19.9%, Japan Airlines 7.5%, American Airlines 7.5%, and a New Zealand Government \\"Kiwi share\\" made up the balance. The Kiwi share has special powers to ensure that New Zealanders retain the majority shareholding. In the same year Air New Zealand listed on the New Zealand Exchange. Newer aircraft In early 1990 Air New Zealand took delivery of its first Boeing 747-400, but industrial action by pilots and cabin crew forced the first aircraft to be leased to Cathay Pacific. The company and its staff had to re-negotiate rates of pay and long hours in the air due to the model's then excellent range before the airliner entered mainline service. The first 747-400 flight finally took place in late 1990. In 1991 Air New Zealand received its first Boeing 767-300, a major improvement and supplement to the seven Boeing 767-200ERs then in service. The 767-300ER variant provided the option of increased range and capacity; it allowed Air New Zealand to open new routes into Asia and to increase frequency on the trans-Pacific service with the introduction of a second daily flight to Los Angeles via Honolulu and later a third via Rarotonga and Apia on alternating days. The Boeing 767-300ERs are retrofitted with winglets to improve on more efficiencies this airliner has to offer. Although the Boeing 767 fleet has reduced due to the arrival of the Boeing 777-200ER, plans envisaged the Boeing 787-9 replacing the last of the type from 2014. The early 1990s saw new routes added: * 1990: Kuala Lumpur, Denpasar, Bangkok * 1991: Nagoya, Taipei * 1993: Seoul * 1994: Sydney ‚Äì Los Angeles, Osaka * 1995: Fukuoka Australia After the success of the deregulation of the Australian domestic air market in 1990, the Keating Government in Australia announced that it would allow New Zealand carriers unlimited access to the Australian market. Air New Zealand immediately planned to operate frequent services between the major Australian cities. However, at the last minute the Australian Transport Minister Laurie Brereton backed out of the deal, and although Air New Zealand was allocated an increased number of international departure slots from Australian cities, it was not permitted to operate domestically within Australia. This had far-reaching implications, as Air New Zealand was forced to look at other ways of increasing its market in Australia, which resulted in the acquisition of Ansett Australia. Expansion Air New Zealand's \\"Pacific Wave\\", introduced in 1996 Air New Zealand Boeing 777 at Shanghai Pudong Airport in January 2007 In 1995 Air New Zealand added Fukuoka to its Japanese destinations, and announced its long- standing plan to buy 50% of Ansett Transport Industries, a significantly larger company than Air New Zealand itself. News Limited and TNT each owned 50%. Ansett held close to half of the large Australian domestic market, but had been declining for some years. Market analysts reported that Ansett had under-performing major assets and an ageing fleet, and needed a capital injection of at least A$300 million to shore up its weak balance sheet. For Air New Zealand, purchasing TNT's half of Ansett represented a way to buy into the rich Australian domestic market. The deal had been under discussion with both of Ansett's owners since October 1994, and required some complex manoeuvring to meet regulatory requirements on both sides of the Tasman, including the sale of Ansett New Zealand, Air New Zealand's only significant home market competitor (to News Limited) to satisfy Commerce Commission requirements, and the sale of 51% of Ansett International (to a consortium of Australian institutional investors) to satisfy Australian Foreign Investment Review Board requirements that, if not met, would have meant the loss of Ansett International's bilateral air service agreement rights. The terms of the agreement saw Air New Zealand pay A$475 million for half of Ansett, including an A$150 million capital injection, and the transaction was completed on 1 October 1996. A low-cost subsidiary, Freedom Air, began operations in 1996. In 1997 South Korean flights were suspended because of the Asian financial crisis, and a small partnership was formed with United Airlines. In 1998 EVA Air and Air New Zealand jointly started operating Boeing 767 services between Taipei and Auckland. In addition, Air New Zealand received three new Boeing Boeing 737-300s to operate on flights between New Zealand and Australia. During 1998 the company started selling all five of its Boeing 747-200 aircraft to Virgin Atlantic, with these being disposed of during 1999 and 2000. Selwyn Cushing became the company's chairman after Bob Matthew stepped down, and also in 1998 Air New Zealand announced alliances with various airlines and the intent to become a member of the Star Alliance in 1999. 1999 saw all five weekly services to Tokyo operated by Boeing 747-400s and an additional 747 arrived in Auckland. At the end of the year, Air New Zealand and United Airlines filed for anti-trust immunity with the United States Department of Transportation because of the two companies' alliance agreements. Over-expansion In March 1999 Ansett and Air New Zealand became full Star Alliance members. 1999 also saw the start of a long and confusing battle over ownership of Ansett. Ansett remained profitable but was having increasing difficulty in finding a way to rationalise its cost structure, and badly needed a capital injection to replace its elderly fleet. Of the two half owners, News Limited was more interested in selling out and investing the proceeds in other industries, while Air New Zealand did not have the funds to spare: with 102 aircraft, nearly 15,000 staff and a turnover of US$2.3 billion (compared with Air New Zealand's 72 aircraft, 9,200 staff and US$1.8 billion turnover) Ansett's need for capital was greater than Air New Zealand's ability to provide it‚Äîparticularly given the age of Air New Zealand's own fleet. Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Qantas expressed an interest in buying Air New Zealand, Ansett employees planned a staff buy-out, and both SIA and Air New Zealand looked at buying News Limited's 50% share of Ansett. In March 1999 SIA made a formal offer of A$500 million for a half share. Given SIA's industry-leading status, ability to fund Ansett's re-equipment and expansion and global marketing network, industry observers were enthusiastic about the move. However, as part of its original deal to buy TNT's half of Ansett, Air New Zealand had a pre-emptive right to News Limited's half, provided only that it matched or bettered other offers. The Air New Zealand board eventually approved the sale to SIA, but negotiations stalled when major Air New Zealand shareholder Brierley Investments began buying more Air New Zealand shares and attempting to get SIA to buy Ansett through either Air New Zealand or Brierley, rather than from News Limited. In June, News Limited withdrew the offer to sell, citing \\"not yet resolved issues\\" between SIA and Air New Zealand. At this stage, Ansett announced an unexpectedly high profit for the year‚ÄîA$149 million‚Äîand News Limited took advantage of that to raise the asking price to A$1 billion. Industry analysts regarded this as far too optimistic in the notoriously boom and bust airline business, and put the true value of a half share at no more than A$700 million. In February 2000 Air New Zealand announced its decision: it would buy the remaining half of Ansett for A$680 million. Industry observers were united in the belief that it was a bad decision: the price was probably too high, and Air New Zealand would not be able to fund the badly needed re-equipment. Monash University aviation economics academic Keith Trace commented \\"... by taking it on, they ensured that their own airline was in terrible danger. That was a dreadful mistake. They were taken for a ride.\\" Former Qantas chief financial officer Australian Gary Toomey was appointed Chief Executive Officer of both Air New Zealand and Ansett Holdings in December 2000. Services to Frankfurt, Sydney and Honolulu from Los Angeles were dropped, and were taken on by Star Alliance partners Lufthansa and United. In 2001 Air New Zealand announced plans to buy 16 new Beechcraft 1900 aircraft to replace its Bandeirantes and Metroliners, which had served faithfully for 20 years, servicing airports without jet capability. Ansett collapse For further information, see Ansett Australia Demise Ansett was in poor shape. Lack of proper maintenance to its 767 fleet‚Äîsome of which were almost 20 years old‚Äîhad seen the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) ground seven aircraft two days before Christmas 2000 while inspections were carried out. In April 2001, one day before the busy Easter holiday period, all 10 Ansett 767s were grounded again when a series of other safety problems came to light, and Ansett was threatened with withdrawal of its Air Operator's Certificate. To cover the loss of one third of Ansett's capacity, Air New Zealand chartered Ansett a Boeing 767 and a Boeing 747 from its own fleet, and additional aircraft were chartered from SIA, Air Canada and Emirates. SIA‚Äî25% owner of Air New Zealand and thus indirectly of Ansett‚Äîagreed to provide technical assistance to get the Boeing 767s back into the air. Despite the great loss of public confidence in the airline, the news was not all bad. Chief executive Gary Toomey announced that the total cost of the groundings was only $5.2 million, and that the seven oldest Ansett Boeing 767s would be sold, along with three of Air New Zealand's 767s, and newer aircraft leased in their place. Toomey said: :What it really highlights though is that nothing has really changed in our strategy, and that is that we need to re-equip, we need to grow our capacity, we need to have new products, so I think it just brings these objectives into focus more and more by having a high profile about what's happened. The reality was rather different. In revenue terms, Air New Zealand was the 39th largest airline in the world, Ansett 32nd. However, both airlines were only marginally profitable and needed a substantial capital injection that neither was able to provide. The larger very successful airlines Qantas and SIA both made offers to buy the Air New Zealand group but needed regulatory approval to lift the 25% foreign ownership rule. The Clark government refused to make a decision. Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton said \\"the idea of selling our national airline to anyone would be an anathema\\", even though Air New Zealand was at that time already 49.9% foreign-owned: 25% by Singapore Airlines, and 24.9% by Brierley Investments, which was originally a New Zealand-based concern but had relocated to Singapore in 2000, and circumvented the foreign ownership restrictions by using a New Zealand-based trust to hold its Air New Zealand shares. The inconsistencies of national pride were not confined to the eastern side of the Tasman: public opinion polls showed that while New Zealanders were strongly opposed to Qantas buying into Air New Zealand, and moderately opposed to SIA increasing its stake, Australians were in favour of a Qantas buy-out of Air New Zealand but objected to any further SIA ownership of Air New Zealand (and thus Ansett).. Meanwhile, Air New Zealand's financial position was deteriorating, and Ansett was losing market share to both Qantas and a new entrant on the Australian domestic market, Virgin Blue. The Air New Zealand board decided that the answer was to still spend more money, and buy Virgin Blue as well as Ansett. On condition that that deal went through, SIA was prepared to fund the purchase of 32 new aircraft for the Air New Zealand group. Virgin Blue, however, was growing fast, largely at the expense of Ansett; the initial A$120 million offer was deemed insufficient and in August Virgin Blue owner Richard Branson, with his customary gift for publicity, put an end to negotiations when he tore up on television what he claimed was an A$250 million Air New Zealand cheque. Although the offer may have been genuine the cheque was not ‚Äì it was actually a cheque from a book of one of the airport managers drawn on a Qantas' staff credit union account. On 10 September 2001, in desperation Air New Zealand offered to sell Ansett to Qantas for $1. After two days' consideration Qantas declined, and Air New Zealand suspended trading in its shares (which had already dropped enormously) and placed Ansett in voluntary administration. Ansett was bankrupt, and Air New Zealand was in barely better shape. The following day Air New Zealand announced a staggering $1.43 billion loss: a $1.32 billion write-off of Ansett, and another $104 million lost by Air New Zealand itself. Ansett's trading loss for the year had been $165 million (plus another $23 million for Ansett International), or about $8 million a month for most of the year, but with a sudden blow-out to around $40 million a month for the last two months. A storm of public criticism on both sides of the Tasman erupted, and bitter accusations were levelled. In particular, it was asked how such massive losses were possible when Ansett had a healthy 74% average load factor. In an angry statement, Air New Zealand denied that there had been a programme of last- minute asset-stripping, that it had put A$200 million of Air New Zealand fuel bills through Ansett, cleaned out Ansett's bank accounts, or taken Ansett engines and spare parts to New Zealand. Ansett's administrators subsequently verified there had been no last-minute asset-stripping, but many refused to let facts get in the way, as Air New Zealand workers in Australia were abused and spat on. The trans-Tasman anger was enormous. At one stage, New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, on her way back to New Zealand from the Middle East, found her aircraft blockaded on the Melbourne Airport tarmac by laid-off Ansett workers, who refused to allow the jet to take off. Eventually, an RNZAF Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft had to be sent to fetch her.\\"NZ PM stuck in Australia\\". ABC. 14 September 2001. The Australian Securities & Investment Commission (ASIC) began an investigation of whether Ansett had gone on trading while insolvent, and eventually determined in July 2002 that it would be too expensive and difficult to proceed with an action which would, in any case, need to be many separate actions on behalf of individual creditors rather than just one. It later became clear from the release of documents under the New Zealand Official Information Act that the New Zealand Government had pressured the Australian Government not to support legal action against Air New Zealand, saying that this would \\"prejudice rather than progress the interests of those with financial claims against the company\\". The Australian government stated that the pressure had no effect on its decisions. New Zealand media criticised Australian media for \\"Kiwi bashing\\", contrasting poor coverage of instances of Australian protectionism and criticising pressure for New Zealand taxpayers to prop up the uncompetitive Australian business. Laid- off Ansett workers were eventually paid most of their entitlements, partly from an A$150 million compensation package offered by Air New Zealand in return for having the ASIC enquiry dropped, but mostly by an A$10-per-seat levy imposed by John Howard's government on Australian airline passengers. Rebirth and re-nationalisation In October 2001 the New Zealand Government announced that it would provide Air New Zealand with an $885 million rescue package, and in return would take up 80% ownership. Gary Toomey resigned as CEO the same month. In early 2002 Ralph Norris, formerly head of ASB Bank, one of New Zealand's main banks, was announced as the new CEO of Air New Zealand, and commenced the difficult task of pulling the airline back from near-death. In mid-2002 Air New Zealand announced it would reconfigure its domestic operations as a lower-cost airline, doing away with business class and meals on most domestic flights, the longest of which was 1 hour 50 minutes. The airline justified this new style of service (known as Express Class) on the basis that few people traveled business class and that travellers would rather save the money on airline ticket costs than pay extra for a meal. Although the company had online bookings for several years, it made internet sales its primary sales medium, abolished travel agents' commissions and added fees for agent, telephone and counter sales. The approach was an outstanding success, with a huge increase in internet bookings being recorded once the new fare structure was introduced, and domestic bookings eventually increasing by 23% on average. During July 2002, the airline announced an order for 15 Airbus A320-200 aircraft, to replace Boeing 737-300 and Boeing 767-200 aircraft then in use on the Tasman. Five of these would be purchased by the airline, whilst the other ten were to be leased. In late 2002 the New Zealand Government agreed in principle to allow Qantas to purchase a 22.5% shareholding at a cost of $550 million; the purchase being subject to regulatory approval in both Australia and New Zealand. However, this proposal was met with resistance from the regulatory bodies in both countries ‚Äì despite industry experts such as International Air Transport Association head Giovanni Bisignani calling their opposition \\"misguided\\" and suggesting that the proposed alliance was a model example of the only possible method of survival for smaller airlines. In late 2003 the Australian and New Zealand regulatory bodies both rejected the alliance as being anti-competitive, despite a worldwide trend for airlines to consolidate (such as the 2003 acquisition of KLM by Air France). Air New Zealand and Qantas both announced they would appeal the decisions. In November 2003 Air New Zealand extended the successful low-cost domestic Express concept to trans-Tasman routes. Early indications are that this move has also proved successful, with an estimated 10% increase of bookings in the first few months of operation. On 30 June 2004 the airline commenced non-stop services from Auckland to San Francisco, the first new international destination for eight years. In September 2004 Air New Zealand was named Best Long Haul Airline in the seventh annual Cond√© Nast Traveler UK Readers' Awards. On 20 September 2004 the New Zealand High Court blocked Qantas' plan to buy 22% of Air New Zealand. Qantas and Air New Zealand decided not to lodge an appeal. However, both Ralph Norris and his counterpart at Qantas, Geoff Dixon, stated that the airlines would continue to assess other forms of cooperation that would not conflict with competition regulations. In October 2004 SIA sold its remaining stake in Air New Zealand. Air New Zealand started its first service to the mainland of China with the launch of Auckland to Shanghai in November 2006. Following that success Beijing was added on 18 July 2008. This route has since been terminated in July 2012. Flights to Bali resumed on 20 June 2012. Seasonal flights to Sunshine Coast a first for the Australian city began on 1 July 2012. This route made Air New Zealand the first overseas airline to fly into four cities of the Australian state of Queensland. Air New Zealand ended flights to Oamaru when it stopped its twice daily service from Christchurch on 1 January 2010. Wanaka lost its only air service when Air New Zealand ended its link from Christchurch on 31 January 2013. However Perth to Christchurch seasonal non-stop flights will resume on 4 December 2013. Air New Zealand has begun another expansion of its international services with flights to Singapore resuming and the opening up of Houston and Buenos Aires. Flights to Houston and Buenos Aires began in December 2015. Air New Zealand ended all Beech 1900D 19 seat flights in 2014/15 and ended air services to Kaitaia, Whakatane and Whanganui. 2010s On 21 December 2010, the New Zealand government approved an alliance between Air New Zealand and Australian airline Virgin Blue (now named Virgin Australia), which allowed both airlines to expand operations between Australia and New Zealand with codeshares for trans- Tasman and connecting domestic flights; and reciprocal access to frequent flyer programmes and airport lounges. Air New Zealand subsequently purchased a 26% shareholding in Virgin Australia Holdings (Virgin Australia's parent company) to cement the relationship. By October 2016 Air New Zealand had sold its remaining stake in Virgin Australia Holdings. Air New Zealand ended its partnership with Virgin Australia on 28 October 2018. In 2011, Air New Zealand introduced the Boeing 777-300ER airliner, as well as the Economy Skycouch, a set of three economy class seats that could be converted into a flat multi- purpose surface by raising the leg rests. After a four-year delay, Air New Zealand took delivery of its first Boeing 787-9 on 9 July 2014. The airline retired its last Boeing 747-400 in September 2014, the last Boeing 737 in September 2015, and the last Boeing 767 in March 2017, leaving it with a simplified fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft for short-haul and Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 aircraft for long-haul. In November 2013 the New Zealand Government reduced its share in Air New Zealand from 73% to 53% as part of its controversial asset sales programme. It made $365 million from this deal. In June 2012, Christopher Luxon was appointed as CEO of Air New Zealand. In mid June 2019, Luxon announced that he was resigning as CEO in order to pursue a career with the New Zealand National Party. In mid October 2019, Air New Zealand named Greg Foran, the former present and chief executive officer of Walmart US, as its new CEO. On 23 October 2019, Air New Zealand announce it would begin flights between Auckland and Newark in October 2020, while also announcing it would terminate flights between Los Angeles and London at the same time after 38 years. Earthquake Emergency Airlift Operations On 22 February 2011 at 12:51 pm local time, New Zealand's second-largest city, Christchurch, was devastated by a 6.3 magnitude earthquake, causing loss of life and extensive damage to the city. Christchurch International Airport was immediately closed for 18 hours to allow airport management to assess the runway, allowing only the most urgent medical and rescue flights. After the \\"all clear\\" was given the airport was opened to international emergency aid flights. The airline drafted in all its available spare aircraft to airlift stranded tourists and refugees out of the shattered city. The airline also provided $50 airfares to allow everyone to leave on flights served directly by the city. Some Auckland-bound domestic services were flown by Boeing 747-400, Boeing 777-200ER and the airline's new Boeing 777-300ER types. Wellington had Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 767-300s serving, aircraft that are seldom seen at that airport. Provincial destinations such as Hamilton, Palmerston North, and Invercargill also received narrow bodied jet fleet aircraft equipment not usually seen at those airports.Rolling update 17 December 2012  2020s  As part of the Evacuations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, an Air New Zealand Boeing 777-200ER was chartered by the New Zealand government to evacuate citizens and residents from Wuhan. The aircraft arrived back in Auckland on the evening of 5 February 2020 with 193 passengers on board: 98 New Zealand citizens and residents, 23 Australian citizens, and the remainder from various Pacific islands. On 16 March 2020, Air New Zealand announced that it would be reducing its long haul capacity by 85% and slashing 30% of its staff members in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. While the airlines has suspended several international and domestic services, it would maintain enough overseas flights for returning New Zealanders and evacuees. On 17 March, the New Zealand Government provided the airline industry with a $600 million support package as part of its $12.1 billion COVID-19 coronavirus business package, however this did not include any provision for Air New Zealand. In mid-March 2020 it was confirmed that due to the company's high debt levels and the impact of Coronavirus, that the government of New Zealand was in negotiations with Air New Zealand for a bailout package estimated to be between $2b and $3b NZD. On 19 March, Air New Zealand shut down its London cabin crew base in response to the coronavirus, affecting 130 flight attendants. On 20 March, the Government agreed to a $900 million loan facility with Air New Zealand to protect essential air routes and to keep the company operating. The loan will be provided in two lots: a tranche of $600m with interest rate expected to be between 7 per cent and 8 per cent per annum and a second tranche of $300m at an expected 9 per cent per annum. As at 11 June 2020 the loan is yet to be drawn. On 7 April, it was reported that reported that Air New Zealand was negotiating with the New Zealand Air Line Pilots' Association (NZALPA) over plans to layoff 387 pilots as part of cutback measures. On 20 May, Air New Zealand announced that it would be laying off 3,500 personnel including 1,300 cabin crew. In addition, it was reported that 950 long and mid-haul crew will lose their jobs while 300 workers will be made redundant in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. 97 jobs were also lost at Air NZ's regional airlines Air Nelson and Mount Cook Airline. On 16 June, it was reported that Air New Zealand would be resuming flights between Auckland and Shanghai from 22 June. On 16 September, it was reported that Air New Zealand had proposed laying off a further 385 cabin crew by the end of the year. In response, the trade union E T≈´ called on the national carrier to stop outsourcing work overseas.

The term job traditionally means a one-off piece of work, and is contrasted with a batch (executing the same steps over many inputs), but non-interactive computation has come to be called \\"batch processing\\", and thus a unit of batch processing is often called a job, or by the oxymoronic term batch job; see job for details. Performing a job consists of executing one or more programs. Each program execution, called a job step, jobstep, or step, is usually related in some way to the others in the job. Steps in a job are executed sequentially, possibly depending on the results of previous steps, particularly in batch processing. The term \\"job stream\\" is particularly associated with mainframes; in the IBM z/OS operating system, a job is initiated by a \`// JOB\` and terminated by the next \`// JOB\` or \`//\` statement. Each job step consists of one \`// EXEC\` statement indicating the program to be executed and usually multiple \`// DD\` statements defining the files and devices to be used. Example A simple example of a job stream is a system to print payroll checks which might consist of the following steps, performed on a batch of inputs: # Read a file of data containing employee id numbers and hours worked for the current pay period (batch of input data). Validate the data to check that the employee numbers are valid and that the hours worked are reasonable. # Compute salary and deductions for the current pay period based on hours input and pay rate and deductions from the employee's master record. Update the employee master \\"year-to-date\\" figures and create a file of records containing information to be used in the following steps. # Print payroll checks using the data created in the previous step. # Update bank account balance to reflect check numbers and amounts written. Each step depends on successful completion of the previous step. For example, if incorrect data is input to the first step the job might terminate without executing the subsequent steps to allow the payroll department to correct the data and rerun the edit. If there are no errors the job will run to completion with no manual intervention.

It was discovered on 9 April 1931, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. Any reference of its later name, Rita, is unknown.  Orbit and classification  Rita belongs to the orbital Hilda group which is located in the outermost part of the main- belt. Asteroids in this dynamical group have semi-major axis between 3.7 and 4.2 AU and stay in a 3:2 resonance with the gas giant Jupiter. Rita, however, is a background asteroid and not a member of the (collisional) Hilda family (). Hildian asteroids are thought to have originated from the Kuiper belt. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 3.4‚Äì4.6 AU once every 7 years and 12 months (2,906 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 7¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first observed as at Heidelberg in 1907. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg in 1908, when it was identified as , approximately 23 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen taxonomy, Rita is a dark and reddish P-type asteroid. The P-type asteroids are some of the darkest objects in the Solar System.  Rotation period  Since 1983, several rotational lightcurves of Rita have been obtained from photometric observations. Lightcurve analysis gave a wide range of divergent rotation periods between 9 and 20.5 hours. The Light Curve Data Base adopts a period of 13.090 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.06 magnitude. Bodies with such a low brightness variation are typically of a spherical rather than elongated shape. The lightcurve was obtained in January 2017, by American astronomer Brian Warner at the Center for Solar System Studies in California ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Rita measures 97 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.041 and 0.058. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous, outer main-belt asteroids of 0.057, and calculates a diameter of 82.72 kilometers with on an absolute magnitude of 9.14.  Naming  Any reference of this minor planet's name to a person or occurrence is unknown.  Unknown meaning  Among the many thousands of named minor planets, Rita is one of 120 asteroids, for which no official naming citation has been published. All of these low-numbered asteroids have numbers between and and were discovered between 1876 and the 1930s, predominantly by astronomers Auguste Charlois, Johann Palisa, Max Wolf and Karl Reinmuth (also see category).

Football, cycling and roller skating are the most popular sports in Colombia. The Government of Colombia sponsors numerous individuals and teams nationally and internationally through the Ministry of Culture to enable sportspeople to represent Colombia in competition. The achievements of professional sportspeople are a source of national pride for Colombians. Football The Colombian Football Federation was founded in 1924 and has been associated with FIFA and CONMEBOL since 1936. Colombia's national team participated in a FIFA World Cup in 1962, followed by others in 1990, 1994, 1998, 2014 and 2018. Its best presentation was in 2014, when the team reached the quarter-finals and James Rodr√≠guez became top scorer of the tournament. The only \\"olympic goal\\" (a goal made directly from one corner shot) in the World Cup was scored for Colombia by Marcos Coll, beating legendary goalkeeper Lev Yashin in a 4‚Äì4 draw with the Soviet Union in 1962. A golden era existed for the national team from the mid-1980s towards the late 1990s when it became one of the most powerful teams in football, with a generation of talented players such as Carlos Valderrama, Andr√©s Escobar, Ren√© Higuita and Faustino Asprilla. Colombia was the champion of the 2001 Copa Am√©rica, which they hosted and set a new record of being undefeated, conceding no goals and winning each match. Prior to that success, they were runners-up to Peru in the 1975 Copa Am√©rica. Colombia was the first team to win FIFA best mover in 1993 where the achievement was first introduced (with some help from their famous 5-0 thrashing of South American powerhouse Argentina at the qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup) and the second team after Croatia to win it twice, with the second being in 2013.Spain finish 2012 on top, Colombia in fifth. fifa.com (19 December 2012). Retrieved on 19 December 2012 Colombia also hosted the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup and is to host the 2016 FIFA Futsal World Cup. Colombia will co-host the 2020 Copa Am√©rica with Argentina. The nation also qualified for the 1968, 1972, 1980, and 1992 Summer Olympics. Throughout the years, many Colombians have also worked for leagues in other nations. The national clubs compete in the Categor√≠a Primera A, which also participates in international tournaments like Copa Libertadores de Am√©rica upon winning or finishing in the first places. In club football, Atl√©tico Nacional became the first Colombian club team to win the Copa Libertadores in 1989 and later in 2016. Once Caldas were the surprise winners of the 2004 Copa Libertadores and the second Colombian team to do so. Cycling Nairo Quintana: Colombian Champion of the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a Espa√±a. Mariana Paj√≥n is a Colombian cyclist, two-time Olympic gold medalist and BMX World Champion. Cycling in Colombia became very popular with the beginning of the annual Vuelta a Colombia race in 1951, followed by the annual Cl√°sico RCN starting in 1961. The triumphs of Mart√≠n Emilio \\"Cochise\\" Rodr√≠guez in European cycling competitions increased the sport's popularity, which in turn helped to develop the Colombian Cycling Federation. Rodriguez was followed by professional Colombian cyclists known as the \\"Colombian beetles\\", which include up to this date Luis \\"Lucho\\" Herrera, Luis Felipe Laverde, Fabio Parra, V√≠ctor Hugo Pe√±a, Santiago Botero, Mauricio Soler. The \\"escarabajo\\" (beetle) nickname was coined by radio announcer Jos√© Enrique Buitrago, while watching Ram√≥n Hoyos climb a hill ahead of French professional racer Jos√© Beyaert during the 1955 Vuelta a Colombia. Colombian cycling has enjoyed a renaissance in the early 2010s, with Colombian riders enjoying international success. One of the factors cited for this success has been the establishment of the 4-72 Colombia cycling team (formerly known as Colombia es Pasi√≥n-Caf√© de Colombia), which has developed several cyclists who have gone on to compete for UCI Worldteams. The government-backed Colombia-Coldeportes cycling team competed at the 2013 Giro d'Italia, and was the first all-Colombian team to do so for 21 years. The team aimed to secure UCI ProTeam status and compete in the Tour de France, however the team announced its disbanding in October 2015 due to the withdrawal of financial support from Coldeportes, the Colombian government's sports ministry. Riders who graduated to the UCI World Tour from the team included Esteban Chaves and Darwin Atapuma. High-profile riders emerging in this period include Nairo Quintana, Rigoberto Uran, Sergio Henao, Carlos Betancur and Mariana Pajon. The two main strongholds of the sport in Colombia are the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the centre of the country and Antioquia in the west, both being mountainous regions. During the 1990s, the government of the Colombian capital, Bogot√° introduced the Ciclov√≠a, which became popular and were introduced later into other Colombian cities. The government of Bogot√° later built Bogot√°'s Bike Paths Network to sponsor the practice of sports by the population and to curb the city's increasing pollution by drivers. The network extends throughout the city with bicycle use increasing five times in the city. There is an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 trips made daily in Bogot√° by bicycle.

Boxing in Colombia was also introduced by Europeans in the late 19th century and became popular in Latin America in the early 20th century, and in Colombia became popular in the 1960s, with the triumphs of Antonio \\"Kid Pambele\\" Cervantes who became a two time world Jr. Welterweight champion. He was then followed by boxers like Prudencio Cardona, Rodrigo Vald√©z, Fidel Bassa, and many more. The success of these boxers created a fan base and many Colombians started to follow the sport. The National Boxing Commission of Colombia (Comisi√≥n Nacional de Boxeo de Colombia) was created and regulated the practice of boxing in Colombia. In the 1980s, the success of Miguel \\"Happy\\" Lora reigned in the bantam weight division (118 pounds) -WBC- from 1985 to 1988 and the silver medal in the Pan American Games of Carlos Jos√© Tamara.

Formerly it had been diked and ditched to create pasture for dairy cows. One segment of the refuge near Millport Slough, an arm of the lower Siletz River, consists of a tidal marsh restored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Ducks Unlimited, and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz. Together they breached of dikes, removed dikes totaling , filled of ditches, and added woody debris to improve fish habitat.

In 1964 it was proposed for large-scale development including a hotel and marina, but the plan was defeated in 1967. The island is now included in the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. Location The island is located within the Bolinas Lagoon, a salt water inlet of the Pacific Ocean. The island is opposite the town of Bolinas, near Stinson Beach, California, and is surrounded by mud flats at low tide.TopoQuest map, USGS, retrieved July 6, 2008 On April 18, 2008, Sage Tezak, Bolinas Lagoon Restoration Coordinator of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary stated in an Advisory Council Meeting that Kent Island's shoreline had historically been dynamic in that it would move, causing the island to change shape. He noted that the appearance of invasive plant species on the island in recent years has stabilized the shoreline, eliminating the gradual movement of the island. History=Saving Kent Island In 1964 development on the island was proposed by Bahia Baulines Inc., which had leased of underwater tidelands. The plan would have begun by dredging mud from the northern end of the lagoon and depositing it on the island to give it more height and to increase the overall size. The construction phase would have included a hotel and restaurant, both with parking lots, as well as an office, a boat facility and marina for up to 1,500 watercraft, and a helicopter pad. The plan was terminated in 1967 when Audubon Canyon Ranch, the Nature Conservancy and the Marin Conservation League worked together to save the island from the development. Funds were raised to purchase the island and give it to the county on the stipulation that the property remain undeveloped as a nature preserve. The Marin County Board of Supervisors voted to accept the island into the public domain just hours before the Bolinas Harbor District would have acted to condemn the island in court to stop Marin County's conservation effort.Marin Independent Journal August 4, 2007 1980s to present day The island became a part of Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary in 1981. In 1998 Bolinas Lagoon was declared one of 17 Wetlands of International Importance in the USA by UNESCO. There are ongoing concerns that the waters around the island are gradually silting, affecting both human activity as well as the flora and fauna of the area. In 2009, the Marin County Open Space District and County of Marin were funded through NOAA to remove invasive species and restore native vegetation to approximately of tidal marsh and regionally rare coastal dune habitat, on and around the island. The project will restore nesting habitat for the endangered snowy plover. Wildlife on and around Kent Island A wildlife sanctuary, the island is a haul-out spot for harbor seals and their pups. A study of seal behavior on the island showed that the animals were often disturbed by nearby human activity, with people rowing past the island in canoes a primary cause. Humans approaching the seals closer than 100 meters caused the animals to leave the sites much more often than activities by people at a greater distance. The island is also a known roosting spot for the California brown pelican. Other avian life includes the long-billed curlew, willets, ring-billed gulls, marbled godwits, American avocets, and black- bellied plovers.

Usage  Unlike its name suggests, Oliver Twist is not chewed. Instead, like dip, the bits are simply inserted between the lip and gum and left to absorb through the mouth. Unlike most dipping tobacco products (especially the American varieties, such as Skoal), however, Oliver Twist is not loose, but rather formed into a cylindrical plug for easier clean-up and more discreet consumption. The pellets are very small, approximately 1 cm by .5 cm and are made from a single leaf. As the product's description reads on its packaging: > Smokeless tobacco. Keep between cheek and gum - don't chew - its long > lasting flavor gives you discreet tobacco satisfaction without > expectorating. When the taste is gone, the pellet is easily removed.  History  Oliver Twist has been manufactured in Odense, Denmark, by House of Oliver Twist A/S since 1805. It is imported into the US by RBJ Sales, Inc. of Dresden, Tennessee. Varieties Currently, Oliver Twist is available in various flavors: Tropical (flavored with anise), Black (flavoured with salmiak liquorice), Royal (flavored with English licorice), Sunberry (blackcurrant- flavored), Eucalyptus, Mint, Citrus, Wintergreen, Arctic, Bergamot and Original (sweet licorice).

Because red dwarfs fuse their hydrogen slowly and are fully convective (allowing their entire hydrogen supply to be fused, instead of merely that in the core), the Universe is currently not old enough for any blue dwarfs to have formed yet, but their future existence is predicted based on theoretical models. Stars increase in luminosity as they age, and a more luminous star needs to radiate energy more quickly to maintain equilibrium. Stars larger than red dwarfs do this by increasing their size and becoming red giants with larger surface areas. Rather than expanding, however, red dwarfs with less than 0.25 solar masses are predicted to increase their radiative rate by increasing their surface temperatures and becoming \\"bluer\\". This is because the surface layers of red dwarfs do not become significantly more opaque with increasing temperature. Blue dwarfs eventually evolve into white dwarfs once their hydrogen fuel is completely exhausted, which in turn will eventually cool to become black dwarfs.

The aim of the process is to ensure a portfolio of best-in-class suppliers is available for use,Roylance, D., Purchasing Performance: Measuring, Marketing, and Selling the Purchasing ... thus it can be an effective tool to select suppliers in the awarding stage of an auction. Supplier evaluation can also be applied to current suppliers in order to measure and monitor their performance for the purposes of ensuring contract compliance, reducing costs, mitigating risk and driving continuous improvement. Process Supplier evaluation and take-on is a continual process within purchasing departments,Bauily, P., Purchasing Principles and Management and forms part of the pre-qualification step within the purchasing process, although in many organizations it includes the participation and input of other departments and stakeholders. Most experts or firms experienced in collecting supplier evaluation information prefer doing so using five-step processes for determining which to approve. Their processes often take the form of either a questionnaire or interview, sometimes even a site visit, and includes appraisals of various aspects of the supplier's business including capacity, financials, quality assurance, organizational structure and processes and performance.¬ª Using effective supplier appraisal techniques to improve the supply chain. - Strategy squared Based on the information obtained via the evaluation, a supplier is scored and either approved or not approved as one from whom to procure materials or services. In many organizations, there is an approved supplier list (ASL) to which a qualified supplier is then added. If rejected the supplier is generally not made available to the assessing company's procurement team. Once approved, a supplier may be reevaluated on a periodic, often annual, basis.Varley, M., Retail Product Management: Buying and Merchandising The ongoing process is defined as supplier performance management. Benefits and drawbacks There are various benefits associated with an effective supplier evaluation process such as mitigation against poor supplier performance or performance failures. The benefits typically include sourcing from suppliers that provide high standards of product and service levels whilst offering sufficient capacity and business stability. Supplier evaluation can help customers and suppliers identify and remove hidden cost drivers in the supply chain. The process of evaluating performance can motivate suppliers to improve their performance. There are several other challenges according to the supplier evaluation. To mitigate this, large corporations has a dedicated department (Procurement Department) performing cost-benefit analysis to evaluate if the company should engage the vendor or perform the task in-house. Such department can take a considerable amount of resources, thus management's commitment and support of a supplier evaluation process is essential. Tools Some of the challenges associated with supplier evaluation may be mitigated by the use of appropriate tools. For simple projects a spreadsheet can be used. But as evaluations become more complex or more frequent data management and data integrity issues become significant. Web Electronic RFP / Tendering systems are often used for initial selection projects. Some products provide functionality for combining both initial selection and ongoing evaluation and benchmarking. Wider, within established procurement teaching, the Carter 10Cs model is an internationally recognised approach. This model looks at aspects which should be evaluated before contracting and as part of the ongoing supplier performance appraisal. The Cs are: * Capacity (does the organization have the capacity to deliver the order?) * Competency (are the organization, its people or its process competent?) * Consistency * Control of process (can the organization control its process and offer flexibility?) * Commitment to Quality (does the organization effectively monitor and manage quality?) * Cash (does the organization have a strong enough financial base?) * Cost (is the product or service offered at a competitive price?) * Culture (are the supplier and buyer cultures compatible?) * Clean (is the organization ethical, funded legitimately, does not engage child labor, etc.?) * Communication efficiency (does the organisation have support technology of information integration to support collaboration and co-ordination in the supply chain?). Financial Services In the UK financial services sector, the Financial Services Supplier Qualification System (FSQS) is a collaborative due diligence system currently used for supplier evaluation by 29 major UK banks, building societies and insurance companies: Aldermore Bank, Allied Irish Bank, Arbuthnot Latham, Bank of England, Bank of Ireland, BNP Paribas Clydesdale Bank (including Virgin Money), Hastings Group, Lloyds Banking Group, LV=, Masthaven Bank, Metro Bank, Nationwide Building Society, NFU Mutual PCF Bank Royal and Sun Alliance, Rugby and Hinckley Building Society, Santander, Shawbrook Bank, Tokio Marine Kiln, TSB Weatherbys Bank The system is operated by Oxford-based company Hellios Information Ltd.Hellios Information Ltd., FSGS for buyers, accessed 4 December 2018 References Category:Business terms Category:Supply chain management ","title":"Supplier evaluation"},{"id":"13303557","text":"Sleepy Hollow is a census-designated place in Marin County, California. It is located south of downtown Novato, at an elevation of 177 feet (54 m). Its population as of the 2010 census is 2,384. Sleepy Hollow is located near San Anselmo, California, located outside the northern town limits. The Terra Linda district of San Rafael lies to the east. Though no roads directly connect Sleepy Hollow with Terra Linda, hiking trails do. Butterfield Road, Sleepy Hollow's main street, is accessed from Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, a major east-west road in Marin County. The community is in ZIP code 94960 and area codes 415 and 628. Lucas Valley-Marinwood lies to the north of Sleepy Hollow, but there are no roads directly connecting the two unincorporated communities. Politics In the state legislature, Sleepy Hollow is in the 3rd Senate District and in the 6th Assembly District. Federally, Sleepy Hollow is in . History In 1838, Domingo Sais received a land grant from General Mariano Vallejo known as Ca√±ada de Herrera, which consisted of 6,659 acres covering what is now Sleepy Hollow, Fairfax and segments of San Anselmo.Swensen In the 1850s, Sais leased the majority of the land that is now Sleepy Hollow to Harvey Butterfield. Butterfield started a dairy farm on the land and the long, winding 2-mile trail that is still to this day the only way in and out of the inclusive community, became known as \\"Butterfield's Road.\\" The next person to acquire the land was a man named Peter Austin who was responsible for planting the multitude of poplar and eucalyptus trees that now line the road.Wood Due to foreclosure, Austin was forced to sell the land to the Hotalings, a wealthy family from San Francisco. The Hotalings built a lavish mansion at the end of the two-mile road, and named it \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" in honor of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, a famous short story written by their friend, author Washington Irving. The Hotalings threw many elaborate parties for hundreds of guests, but soon left the mansion and returned to San Francisco. The next owner of the mansion was Sigmund Herzog who founded a dairy farm on the property. Later a Chicago syndicate bought the land and attempted to create a luxury hotel complete with golf course, pool, and private man-made lake, but this idea quickly fell through due to the stock market crash prior to The Great Depression.Dixon In the 1930s, Sleepy Hollow boasted the western United States' only \\"play as you go\\" 18-hole golf course that became the second largest in the country. In 1939, the land was given to the U.S. Army in order to secretly store ammunition for World War II until the war was over. In 1946, A.G. Raisch bought the mansion and an additional 500 acres. Following the tradition, Raisch threw many luxurious parties for hundreds of guests. He eventually left the estate and it remained unoccupied for several years until it spontaneously caught on fire. The majority of the house burned down, leaving only a wall and a set of steps that still stand today. Sleepy Hollow became a residential area due to the opening of a real estate company shortly after World War II. In 1966 the Dominican Order of the Catholic Church bought the \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" mansion and opened the San Domenico School for Girls. Presently, San Domenico School is a private, co-ed K-12 day school, with boarding in the high school for girls only.

In 1966, he patented personal identification number (PIN) technology and an automated teller machine (ATM).UK Patent No.1,197,183 - 2 May 1966. He is generally considered the inventor of the modern ATM. Goodfellow was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, where he later attended St Mirin's Academy. As a 28-year-old development engineer at Kelvin Hughes, he was given the project of developing an automatic cash dispenser in 1965. His system accepted a machine readable encrypted card, with a numerical PIN keypad. The invention received UK Patent No. 1,197,183 with a priority date of 2 May 1966. In 1967, the world's first ATM was in Enfield in North London, which used a rival design by John Shepherd-Barron of De La Rue that accepted cheques impregnated with a radioactive chemical. De La Rue did not patent the design. In 2005, Shepherd-Barron was widely reported as the inventor of the cash dispenser after he received an OBE. This compelled Goodfellow to publicize his patent. \\"[Shepherd-Barron] invented a radioactive device to withdraw money. I invented an automated system with an encrypted card and a pin number, and that's the one that is used around the world today,\\" he said. Despite being appointed an OBE in the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours for his invention of the personal identification number, Goodfellow regrets the lack of recognition and compensation for his inventiveness, since PIN codes are ubiquitous today. Goodfellow was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame in 2016.

History Rodeo Valley appears on a plat of the Rancho El Pinole in 1860 and Rodeo Creek on another in 1865. Watershed and course The Rodeo Creek watershed drains about , gathering flows from numerous small tributaries originating on the southwest slopes of Franklin Ridge. The creek flows in a generally north to northwesterly direction approximately to San Pablo Bay. The town of Rodeo has a flood control channel. Since 1874, the Union Pacific Railroad (then known as the Southern Pacific Railroad) traversed the shoreline at the mouth of Rodeo Creek. In 1890 the Rodeo Dam and Reservoir were constructed in the lower watershed but was decommissioned and used for fill to construct the Interstate 80 crossing. Further up Rodeo Creek it is also transected by Highway 4. Ecology Threatened and/or endangered species that inhabit the middle watershed include Western pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata), Alameda whipsnake (Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus), Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii) and in the middle and lower watershed, California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii). The Rodeo Creek watershed also hosts the only population of federally endangered Contra Costa goldfields (Lasthenia conjugens). The watershed is mostly grasslands but a mix of coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia)/California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) woodland and valley oak (Quercus lobata) woodland inhabits northern facing hillslopes in the upper watershed and there is an unusually high diversity of oak tree species, with five species found in the watershed. Electrofishing in 1974,1981 and 1994 did not reveal steelhead trout. Two grade-control drop structures from the flood control channel in the lower watershed are partial barriers to fish passage since the early 1960s, however, early land use activities in the late 1800s had the first and perhaps most profound impacts upon anadromous fish. Fish surveys in 1984 observed hitch, Sacramento pikeminnow, California roach, Sacramento sucker, three-spined stickleback and non-native mosquito fish at various sites in the lower watershed. The John Muir Land Trust (MHLT) owns three properties in the watershed, the 702 acre Fernandez Ranch and 483 acre Franklin Canyon property.

The Peninsular Ranges, including the Sierra de San Francisco and Sierra de la Giganta, run the length of the peninsula, separate the Gulf of California xeric scrub from the Baja California Desert on Baja California's Pacific slope. The ecoregion extends from the gulf shore to the crest of the mountains, and includes several of the islands in the gulf, the largest of which are Isla √Ångel de la Guarda, Isla del Carmen, and Isla San Jos√©. To the north, the Gulf of California xeric scrub transitions to the Sonoran Desert. At the southern end of the peninsula, the Gulf of California xeric scrub transitions to the San Lucan xeric scrub. Flora Most of the ecoregion is covered in dry shrubland. The principal shrubs are creosote (Larrea tridentata) and desert burr sage (Ambrosia dumosa), with Jatropha cinerea, palo fierro (Olneya tesota), Acacia brandegeana, Cercidium floridum, and Pithecellobium undulatum. Palm oases are found in stream valleys, and sustain a plant community that thrives with year-round moisture. The native palm Washingtonia robusta and introduced date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) are characteristic trees, along with the reeds Typha domingensis and Phragmites communis. The ecoregion is home to 238 species of plants. 20 to 25% of the plant species are endemic to the ecoregion, and there are 20 endemic plant genera. Fauna Large mammals include the desert bighorn (Ovis canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and puma (Puma concolor). Threatened birds of the ecoregion include the masked bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus ridewayi) and peninsular yellowthroat (Geothlypis beldingii). There are nine endemic reptile species. Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 11,386 km¬≤, or 50%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.

The creek has one of the last primarily undeveloped watersheds in the Bay Area. Course The headwaters of Pinole Creek are in the Briones Hills on Costa Peak, within the western area of Briones Regional Park. It flows westerly through the towns of Pinole and El Sobrante,TopoQuest map, USGS, retrieved July 5, 2008 to its river mouth at the Chelsea Wetlands in Hercules on San Pablo Bay. Its mouth is east of Point Pinole. History The name Pinole is from the Spanish term for \\"parched corn\\", which the Mexicans ground for eating. In 1823, a Mexican land grant for that included Pinole Creek was granted to Don Ignacio Martinez, a Commandant of the San Francisco Presidio. The land grant was initially known as El Rancho de La Nuestra Sonora de Merced, and later renamed Rancho El Pinole. Martinez built the first adobe in Pinole Valley and brought his family to settle the property with livestock and orchards. Watershed The upper watershed contains large areas of open space and managed grazing lands, with ranching and agricultural activities, and residential equestrian properties. The lower watershed contains the historic Old Town District of Pinole, and suburban neighborhoods in Pinole, El Sobrante, and Hercules. The watershed follows the regional geologic northwest‚Äìsoutheast orientation, similar to the orientation of the Berkeley Hills, and is located just northeast of the Sobrante Ridge. The watershed is approximately in area, extending from headwaters on Costa and Duarte Peaks in the Briones Hills, northwest to the San Pablo Bay just east of Wilson Point. The average annual rainfall for the Pinole Creek watershed is 610 mm (24 in), with 90% falling between November and April. There are twelve minor, locally named tributaries and the gradient is 1%. In 1965, the Army Corps of Engineers armored the creek channel between Interstate 80 and San Pablo Bay for flood control. However, this removed riparian zone vegetation and tree cover needed for food, shelter, and shade for fish and other wildlife. Ecology=Fauna Biologists from the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) have observed Steelhead trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) in the Pinole Creek watershed of multiple ages. Genetic studies by EBMUD in 1999 suggest that the trout are native Central California stock and not introduced. Perennial flows are jeopardized by water usage in the upper watershed but the creek may have the best trout restoration potential in the East Bay because large portions of the watershed are in open space. However, the I-80 crossing may be a significant obstacle to upstream trout migration. Pinole Creek supports a mostly native fish assemblage including rainbow/steelhead trout, California roach (Lavinia symmetricus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis), Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Prickly sculpin (Cottus asper). Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) are nonnative fishes found predominately in the lower section of Pinole Creek, below Interstate 80. Flora Native plants are species of the California chaparral and woodlands and riparian forest habitats. Invasive plant species such as Giant reed (Arundo donax), Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), Yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus discolor) and many others are established along riparian zone sections of Pinole Creek.

The motif was first used in, and is particularly associated with, the city of Dresden. The sequence has been used in various forms by composers since the 19th century. Composition The Dresden amen was composed by Johann Gottlieb Naumann (1741‚Äì1801) for use in the Royal chapel in Dresden. Such was its popularity that it spread to other churches, both Catholic and Lutheran, in Saxony. The \\"Dresden amen\\" is actually the second and third parts of a threefold amen. Use in classical music Felix Mendelssohn used the Dresden amen in his fifth symphony, the \\"Reformation\\". In the first movement, the theme appears in the strings: 400px The theme was also used by Richard Wagner, most notably in his last opera, Parsifal. Wagner was a Kapellmeister in Dresden from 1842 to 1849, but he would probably have learnt the motif as a boy attending church in Dresden. It was incorporated into one of his earliest operas, Das Liebesverbot, and also appears in the third act of Tannh√§user. Anton Bruckner used the Dresden amen in several motets (Christus factus est WAB 11, Virga Jesse WAB 52 and Vexilla regis WAB 51), the finale of his Fifth Symphony and the adagio of his last symphony, the Ninth, while Gustav Mahler incorporated it into the last movement of his first symphony, \\"Titan\\". Manuel de Falla quoted from it in his incidental music for Calder√≥n de la Barca's El gran teatro del mundo. Alexander Scriabin inserted a theme reminiscent of the Dresden amen in the first movement (Luttes [\\"Struggles\\"]) of his Symphony no. 3. Eric Ball's tone poem The Kingdom Triumphant, a musical picture of the first and second coming of Christ, uses the Dresden amen prior to the presentation of the hymn Helmsley with its associated words \\"Lo, He comes with clouds descending\\". Carl Davis used the Dresden Amen prominently in his score for the sound-added reissue of the 1925 silent film Ben-Hur, particularly in scenes featuring the life of Christ. John Sanders based his Responses for Evensong on the Dresden Amen. Igor Stravinsky starts the 3rd movement of the Symphony of Psalms with a shortened version of the Dresden Amen, finishing with a dominant chord on tonic pedal note.

In 1932 he commanded the expedition of the Soviet icebreaker Alexander Sibiryakov which made the first successful crossing of the Northern Sea Route in a single navigation without wintering. This voyage was organized by the All-Union Arctic Institute (presently known as the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute). The Sibiryakov expedition The Sibiryakov sailed from Archangelsk, crossed the Kara Sea and chose a northern, unexplored way around Severnaya Zemlya to the Laptev Sea. In September the propeller shaft broke and the icebreaker drifted for 11 days. However, the Sibiryakov used its sails and arrived in the Bering Strait in October. The icebreaker reached the Japanese port of Yokohama after 65 days, having covered more than 2500 miles in the Arctic seas. This was regarded as a heroic feat of Soviet polar seamen and Chief of Expedition Otto Schmidt and Captain Vladimir Voronin were received with many honors on their return to Russia. The icebreaker Sibiryakov continued in service until it was sunk in 1942 after an unequal fight with German heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer during Operation Wunderland in World War II. The Cheliuskin expedition In 1933-34 Voronin commanded another icebreaker on a dramatic, albeit not so fortunate, expedition. In July 1933 the Cheliuskin sailed from Leningrad before a large crowd. However, in September icebreaker Cheliuskin got stuck in pack ice in the Chukchi Sea near Kolyuchin Island. The crew worked hard to free the ship from the surrounding ice, succeeding after almost a week. But the ship became stuck again and drifted in the general direction of the pack ice toward the Bering Strait. By the end of November it became obvious that the Cheliuskin would not break free from the pack ice and would have to winter on the Chukchi Sea. Eventually the ship was squeezed by large ice floes and was in danger of sinking. Captain Voronin ordered the crew to unload equipment from the ship and set up a camp site astern of the ship. But cracks in the ice formed under the tents, forcing the crew to load their equipment back onto the ship. The Cheliuskin drifted for the next two months in the Chukchi Sea to the east of Wrangel Island. Finally, increasing pressure resulted in the ship's creaking and eventual breach by ice. Voronin and Otto Schmidt managed to jump off just in time before the Cheliuskin sank close to Kolyuchin Island. Thus only one crew member went down with the ship. The crew then set up tents on a part of the ice surface that was named Camp Schmidt. The crew made radio contact with the village of Uelen on the Chukotka Peninsula and asked for help. During a dramatic rescue operation, pilot Anatolii Liapidevskii sighted Camp Schmidt, landed his plane on the ice, and rescued the women and children before returning to Uelen. The remaining passengers and crew of the ill-fated icebreaker Cheliuskin were rescued later and flown to Cape Vankarem on the Chukotka Peninsula. Due to severe weather conditions, the rescue took one month with planes trying hard to carry out the rescue operation from Khabarovsk; Nome in Alaska; and Cape Oliutorskii until they were successful.Cambridge University Press: \\"Discovery of the wreck of the Soviet steamer Chelyuskin on the bed of the Chukchi Sea\\", 2007 Memory Some geographic locations in Russia have been named in honor of this Soviet captain and explorer of the Arctic waters *Voronina Island, a small island group in the Kara Sea. *Banka Voronina, a shoal in the Gulf of Finland . *Bukhta Voronina, a bay in the NW shores of Novaya Zemlya. * The Voronin Trough, a geological feature in the Arctic Ocean basin with a depth of 450m located 290 km east of Franz Josef Land.

It is owned by New York Public Radio along with WNYC (AM), Newark, New Jersey-licensed classical music outlet WQXR-FM (105.9 MHz), New Jersey Public Radio, and the Jerome L. Greene Performance Space. New York Public Radio is a not-for-profit corporation, incorporated in 1979, and is a publicly supported organization. The station broadcasts from studios and offices located in the Hudson Square neighborhood in lower Manhattan. WNYC- FM's transmitter is located at the Empire State Building. The station serves the New York metropolitan area. History=Early years (1943‚Äì1994) WNYC-FM began regularly scheduled broadcasts on the FM band on March 13, 1943 at 43.9 MHz as the sister station to WNYC. Known originally as W39NY, the FM outlet adopted its present WNYC-FM identity and its present frequency of 93.9 MHz within a few years. In 1961 the pair were joined by a television operation, as WUHF (channel 31) took to the air in an experimental format. The following year the station was renamed WNYC-TV. The Municipal Broadcasting System (which was renamed the WNYC Communications Group in 1989) helped to form National Public Radio in 1971, and the WNYC stations were among the 90 stations that carried the inaugural broadcast of All Things Considered later that year. The station's ownership by the City meant that it was occasionally subject to the whims of various mayors. As part of a crackdown on prostitution in 1979, then-Mayor Ed Koch tried to use WNYC to broadcast the names of \\"johns\\" arrested for soliciting. Announcers threatened a walkout and station management refused to comply with the idea; after one broadcast the idea was abandoned. See John Hour. Independence from the City (1994‚Äìpresent) Shortly after assuming the mayoralty in 1994, Rudolph W. Giuliani announced he was considering selling WNYC-AM-FM. Giuliani believed that broadcasting was no longer essential as a municipal service, and that the financial compensation from selling the stations could be used to help the City cover budget shortfalls.\\"Opinion: Don't sell out WNYC.\\" The New York Times, February 28, 1994. Retrieved January 12, 2013. The final decision was made in March 1995: while the City opted to divest WNYC-TV (now WPXN-TV) through a blind auction to commercial buyers, WNYC-AM-FM was sold to the WNYC Foundation for $20 million over a six-year period, far less than what the stations could have been sold for if they were placed on the open market. While the sale put an end to the occasional political intrusions of the past, it required the WNYC Foundation to embark on a major appeal towards listeners, other foundations, and private benefactors. The station's audience and budget have continued to grow since the split from the City. Manhattan Municipal Building, WNYC's home from 1922 to 2008 The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 destroyed WNYC- FM's transmitter atop the World Trade Center. WNYC-AM-FM's studios, in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building, had to be evacuated and station staff was unable to return to its offices for three weeks. The FM signal was knocked off the air for a time. WNYC-FM temporarily moved to studios at National Public Radio's New York bureau in midtown Manhattan, where it broadcast on its still operating AM signal transmitting from towers in Kearny, New Jersey and by a live Internet stream. The stations eventually returned to the Municipal Building. Move to new studios (2008) On June 16, 2008 NYPR moved from its of rent-free space scattered on eight floors of the Manhattan Municipal Building to a new location on Varick Street, near the Holland Tunnel. The station now occupies three and a half floors of a 12-story former printing building. The new offices have ceilings and of space. The number of recording studios and booths has doubled, to 31. There is a new 140-seat, street-level studio for live broadcasts, concerts and public forums and an expansion of the newsroom of over 60 journalists. Renovation, construction, rent and operating costs for the new Varick Street location amounted to $45 million. In addition to raising these funds, NYPR raised money for a one-time fund of $12.5 million to cover the cost of creating 40 more hours of new programming and three new shows. The total cost of $57.5 million for both the move and programming is nearly three times the $20 million the station had to raise over seven years to buy its licenses from the City in 1997. Acquisition of WQXR (2009) On October 8, 2009 WNYC took control of classical music station WQXR-FM, then at 96.3. WQXR's intellectual property (call letters and format) was acquired from the New York Times Company as part of a three-way transaction with Univision Radio. WNYC also purchased the 105.9 FM frequency of Univision's WCAA (now WXNY-FM). WQXR-FM's classical format moved to 105.9 and WXNY's Spanish Tropical format debuted at 96.3. The deal resulted in WQXR becoming a non- commercial station. With WQXR as a co-owned 24-hour classical station, WNYC-FM dropped its remaining classical music programming to become a full-time news/talk station. Past personalities Past WNYC radio personalities include H. V. Kaltenborn, who hosted radio's first quiz program on WNYC in 1926, the Brooklyn Daily Eagles Current Events Bee, a forerunner to shows like National Public Radio's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! In its early years the station lacked funds for a record library and would borrow albums from record stores around the Manhattan Municipal Building, where its studios were located. Legend has it, a listener began lending classical records to the station and in 1929, WNYC began broadcast of Masterwork Hour, radio's first program of recorded classical music. Following the U.S. entry into World War II, then-mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia made use of the station every Sunday in his Talk to the People program. During a lengthy newspaper workers strike, La Guardia also used the WNYC airwaves to read the latest comic strips to local youngsters while they were not available in New York. Margaret Juntwait, an announcer and classical music host at WNYC for 15 years, left for the Metropolitan Opera in September 2006. Prior to her death in 2015, Juntwait served as announcer for the Met's Saturday afternoon radio broadcasts, the first woman to hold the position and only the third regular announcer of the long-standing broadcast series, which was launched in 1931. John Schaefer, a music show host at WNYC since 1982, has written liner notes for more than 100 albums, for everyone from Yo-Yo Ma to Terry Riley and was named a \\"New York influential\\" by New York Magazine in 2006. Programming WNYC produces 100 hours a week of its own programming, including nationally syndicated shows such as On the Media, The New Yorker Radio Hour, and Radiolab, as well as local news and interview shows that include The Brian Lehrer Show, All of It with Alison Stewart, and Soundcheck. The entire schedule is streamed live over the internet and several shows also air over Sirius XM. As a result, the station receives listener calls from far-flung states and even has international listeners. WNYC has a local news team of 38 journalists, producers, editors, and other broadcasting professionals. * On the Media is a nationally syndicated, weekly one-hour program hosted by Brooke Gladstone and Bob Garfield, formerly of Advertising Age, covering the media and its effect on American culture and society.

(2002) The Great Rock Discography, Canongate, , p. 1014 is an English singer-songwriter and musician, who has been a member of the Strawbs at various stages of the band's career, beginning in the 1970s. Career Lambert was born in Hounslow, Middlesex. He was a member of several bands in the 1960s, including The Syndicate, The Chains, and Friday's Chyld / Fire.Eder, Bruce \\"Dave Lambert Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 16 July 2011 In 1972 he joined the King-Earl Boogie Band, an outfit formed by two former members of Mungo Jerry. They had briefly fired Ray Dorset from Mungo Jerry with the intention of replacing him on guitar and vocals with Lambert, until Dorset was reinstated by management and record company. The King-Earl Boogie Band's debut album was produced by Dave Cousins, a move which led to Lambert playing on Cousins' solo album Two Weeks Last Summer. Lambert then joined Cousins in Strawbs on guitar and vocals later in 1972, replacing Tony Hooper, and playing on the album Bursting at the Seams, which reached number two in the UK Albums Chart, the album including Lambert's song \\"The Winter and the Summer\\". In 1973 Lambert and founding member Dave Cousins started a new line-up of the band that continued until they split up in 1978. He subsequently worked as a songwriter in partnership with Chas Cronk, recorded as a solo artist and spent time working as a ski instructor. Lambert rejoined Strawbs in the 1980s and is still a member of the band. In 2006 he was part of a briefly-reformed Fire.

(1956) The Toxic Plants of Western Australia Perth, West Australian Newspapers. p. 76 page 639 The species grows to a height of up to 4 metres. Between late winter and early summer (August to December in Australia) it produces yellow-orange pea-flowers with a central yellow area encircled by a band of red, and a maroon keel. The leaves are cuneiform, obovate or elliptic.http://esperancewildflowers.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/gastrolobium- bilobum-heart-leaf-poison.html The species was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown and published in Hortus Kew in 1811.http://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/cd- keys/peakey/key/The%20Pea%20Key/Media/Html/nomenclature/Gastrolobium_bilobum.htm. In the nineteenth century as a plant within the group of gastrolobium, it was written about in the local press. This continued into the early and mid twentieth century, due to the affects on agriculture. It has been further analyzed within the Australian Nucleotide and Protein sequencing. The vernacular name has been common for over 140 years, and is inappropriate due to the leaves being wedge shaped, not heart shaped as the name suggests. It occurs in the south-west of the state, usually on granite-based soils on peaks and outcrops as well as along rivers. It is associated with karri and marri forest as well as mallee and heathland.

Cuomo gained a degree in law and then simultaneously worked in journalism and the theatre, moving on to fiction and historical studies.

Notturno veneziano con messa nera e fantasmi d'amore and the nonfiction I dieci examined the Italian scientists who signed the \\"Racial Manifesto\\" in 1938 leading to the introduction of racial laws. Among his other works of fiction are I semidei, a spy story set in contemporary Italy with clear references to many of the major figures involved in Tangentopoli inspired by his work as journalist, Il signore degli specchi on the life of Nostradamus, and Scroll on the legend that Shakespeare may not have been English. He is also the author a five-volume series on the origins of Europe, Il romanzo di Carlo Magno, and a biography of Rita da Cascia, Santa Rita degli impossibili. The latter, rejecting a sort of hagiographic stance, instead reconstructs the mystery in which the medieval mystic was involved surrounding the murder of her husband.

In Washington, D.C., the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers Plaque on their HQ. As an advocacy group for the automobile industry on public policy issues, an example of the alliance's activity includes sponsorship of the Transportation Data Center at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI). Likewise, the alliance is active in political lobbying on behalf of the industry. The alliance appealed, for instance, a district-court ruling in California in September 2007 that upholds states' ability to regulate exhaust emissions, the issue having a strong bearing on state and federal vehicle mileage regulations. They also have weighed in on the federal government's new fuel economy and emissions standards proposals calling for other industries to do their part in helping to trim pollution and conserve energy. The Alliance opposes the Motor Vehicle Owners' Right to Repair Act. In September 2009, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers joined the Obama administration and environmentalists in opposing an effort to bar the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for one year from attempting to regulate green-house-gas emissions for power plants and other large sources, preferring a single nationwide set of rules, a main priority since 2002.

The Vyaasakuta were the pontifical saints known for their scholarship and exposition of Madhva's philosophy. The Daasakuta were the peripatetic saint disciples of the Vyaasakuta sanyasins. They were proficient singers and composers and used classical music and the Kannada language as a medium to propagate the teachings and philosophy of the Dvaita school. While Sripadaraya is sometimes credited with starting this musical movement, Purandaradaasa, a disciple of Vyaasasraaya, became renowned as Karnataka Sangita Pitaamaha. The devotees of Panduranga Vitthala of Pandharapur in the Varakari tradition traveled through Karnataka and composed and wrote almost entirely in Kannada. The Haridaasas had a seminal influence on Carnatic music. Later composers from Karnataka and outside, including the venerated 'Trinity' and musical treatises exhibit and acknowledge these influences. They laid the foundations of what is today called Karnataka or Carnatic music. Theory The 15th century marked a watershed period in the history of Indian classical music. Sripadarayaru, a contemporary of Kallinatha (the commentator on Sarngadeva's Sangitaratnakara), was a musician and composer who heralded the musical traditions of the Haridasa movement. Vyasarajaru, Vadirajaru, Purandaradasaru and Kanaka Dasaru (15th ‚Äì 16th century) who followed in the tradition were contemporaries of celebrated musicologists like Ramamatya (Svaramelakalanidhi), Poluri Govindakavi (Ragatalachintamani) and Pundarika Vitthala (Sadragachandro\`daya, Ragamala, Ragamanjari and Nartananirnaya). Other distinguished composers of the time included Tallapakam Annamacharya and his descendants, Bhadraachala Ramadas from Andhra, the Veerashaiva saint Nijagunashivayogi and Ratnakaravarni, the Jaina saint from Karnataka. Prolific contributions of these composers and their contemporaries marked a period of renaissance in the musical history of India and Carnatic music. The impact of this renaissance was further amplified by the close proximity of these composers and theoretician. Paradigmatic changes, such as the merger of madhyama grama into Sadjagrama, the standardisation of all melodic materials within the frame of the Sadjagrama, a new alignment of intervallic values and scalar temperament, tuning of keyboard chordophones, models of melodic classification wrought during this period are reflected in the music and compositions of the Haridasas. The tamburi (a stringed drone instrument) often identified with the Haridasas, is mentioned for the first time by Sripadaraya and subsequently by Vyasarayaru and Purandaradasaru. The Haridasas as well as Palkuriki Somanatha (14th century), Chandrashekhara and Nijaguna Shivayogi (16th century) give a wealth of technical vocabulary. Pedagogy Purandaradasa is credited with laying the foundations of the systematic study of Karnataka Music. He composed the elementary solfeggio exercises called sarale (svarali), janti (varase), tala- alankaras as well as the group of songs called pillari gitas. These exercises form the first lessons in learning Carnatic music even today. Prasanna Venkatadasa (17th century) testifies in a song that Purandaradasa composed in the gita, thaya, suladi, ugabhoga, pada, padya-vrata (vrittanama) and prabandha forms. Though his thayas or prabandhas are not available now, some of his gitas or padas may be reconciled into prabandha types. The organisation of his gitas into a pedagogic scheme, however, seems to be the work of later Haridasas. Another popular song (kereya niranu kerege chelli) was originally a suladi and that yet another, the analekhara was initially a pillari gita. Svarajati, Varna, Kriti and other items may have been added to the scheme as late as the 18th century. Purandaradasa is also believed to have introduced the mayamalavagaula raga scale as a pedagogic model. This raga was called malavagaula at the time, and lacked the second and fifth degrees. Purandaradasa or one of his peers added two notes to the scale, thus converting the pentatonic to a heptatonic scale. The Malavagaula was a mela as well as a raga, and had the largest number of ragas grouped under it. Malahari, an ancient raga, was also grouped under this mela. Purandaradasa and other Haridasas refer to the malavagaula, Malahari and several others by the collective name of battisa (32) raga. This pedagogic model differed from the theoretical standard of the suddha-svara-saptaka, which corresponds to the Kanakangi of the present day. The suladi talas, which include a large number of their compositions was also used to teach the beginners. Musical Material=Ragas The Haridasas mention a corpus of thirty-two ragas called battisa raga, known in Karnataka since the 12th century with repeated mentions in medieval Kannada literature. The Haridasas employed a scheme of classification in which a set of ragas might have the same root name but were prefixed differently, thus grouping together ragas which differed widely in intervallic content. They also classified ragas into sets of five which alluded to the five primordial elements - prithvi, upp, tejas, vayu and akasha. Thanks to their descriptions in contemporary musical treatises, these ragas, names and classifications have survived to the present times enabling musicologists to recreate their music. Tala The Haridasas' most enduring contribution is to the theory and exposition of the tala. They organised them into a simple, comprehensive, logical and organic system, and systematised and reorganised the conceptual and empirical paraphernalia of the tala. They removed archaic and obsolescent details and accommodated forms from folk music and other sources. Importantly, they reduced the structural components and forms of desi talas to the bare minimum of suladi talas. They also created deshyadi and madhyadi talas. Minor adjustments between talas of the past and the talas of their own times were carried out while maintaining historical continuity. They did this by working on talas, traditionally prescribed to ancient vernacular compositions known as salagasuda Prabandhas. After extensive modification at their hands, these songs came to be called suladis and the talas, suLadi taLas. These talas in their modern form are the dhruva, mathya, rupaka, jhampa, triputa, atta and eka talas. These developments were stabilised and sustained by successive generations of Haridasas who, in their large numbers, prolific and varied compositions gave currency to these talas. These talas are now in exclusive usage in Carnatic music. Musical form As early as the 14th century, Narahari Teertha offered the first model of the pada, which was adopted and developed by extensive experimentation by successive Haridasa composers. This became the prototype of the most important musical form of Carnatic music, the Kriti while retaining its original form as devaranama. The ancient salagasuda prabandhas were restructured into the suladi and ugabhoga, two independent forms. They drew upon several Kannada folk sources such as the lullaby, koluhaDu, udayaraga, suvvakke, sobane, gundakriya etc., to enrich Carnatic musical forms. Early prabandha forms, such as gadya, churnika, dandaka, shukasarita, umatilaka and sudarshana, were revived. They innovated with vrittanama. Vadiraja composed the Bhramaragita, the first musical opera in any south Indian language and the first koravanji dance drama. Spiritual and mundane conundra feature prominently in their songs. Apart from their numerous compositions in Kannada, Purandaradasa composed in the Bhandira language while Vadiraja composed in Tulu also. Their compositions use a range of musical instruments. These included the tamburi, vina, dandika, kombu, flute, ankle-bells, bhringimela, panchavadya maddala, bheri, rudravina, titti, nagasvara, conch, mridanga, cymbols, dundubhi, damaru, tambata, mauri, tuttuti, kinnari, and pancha maha shabda. Influence The Haridasas played a crucial role in the growth of Carnatic music, influencing the composers of Andhra and Tamil Nadu. Tyagaraja‚Äôs biography acknowledges the influence of Purandaradasa; this influence is clear in the theme and treatment of several of Tyagaraja's compositions. Tulaja, the Maharashtra Ruler of Tanjore (1729‚Äì1735 AD), deals extensively in his Sangitasaramrita with the various musical forms of the Haridasas. He heaps praise on Vyasaraya and Purandaradasa as great composers and trendsetters in music. Numerous manuscripts in Tamil Nadu testify to the great popularity of Haridasa compositions as early as the 18th century. Purandaradasa, in fact was hailed as the father of Karnataka music, first in Tamil Nadu and then in the rest of the country. Though their compositions were imbued with the elements of Carnatic music and composed specifically in that tradition, their compositions have also made their way into the Hindustani music world, thanks mainly to eminent exponents of Hindustani music from northern Karnataka.

The main purpose of the party is to address the voices of the middle people, people who are undecided about the constant political deadlock between the KMT and the DPP. Policies The members of the party want no part in the ongoing political struggle between DPP and KMT, but instead wish to be the \\"peace-keepers\\" between the two major parties. The TSP declared that it will not support any of the candidates fielded by the Pan-Greens or the Pan-Blues in the presidential election of 2008. The position of the new party on Taiwanese national identity is that the Taiwanese community, comprising the 23 million people in Taiwan and its outlying islands, is an independent and sovereign nation, with the Republic of China as its constitutional name. TSP believes that the independent status of Taiwan fits the interests of most Taiwanese. History TSP has called for establishment of the country's \\"eighth constitutional reform\\"‚Äîor the \\"third republic\\" constitutional reform‚Äîcalling for a parliamentary system of government; single-member constituency and two-vote electoral system; the holding of a nationwide referendum on the content of a new constitution; and lowering the threshold to initiate constitutional reforms.

She was named for Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive, a British general of the Seven Years' War who won the Battle of Plassey and became Governor of British India. Her main guns were taken from the obsolete pre-dreadnought battleship . She spent World War I in the English Channel bombarding German positions along the Belgian coast. She was fitted with a single gun in 1918, but only fired four rounds from it in combat before the end of the war. She was deemed redundant after the end of the war and was sold for scrap in 1927.  Design = General characteristics  Lord Clive had an overall length of , a beam of including the torpedo bulge, without, and a draft of at deep load.

On trials Lord Clive made . She carried of coal which gave her a range of at .  Armament  Lord Clive mounted two BL Mk VIII guns in a single hydraulically powered turret with 100 rounds per gun. Her secondary armament consisted of a pair of 12 pounder guns for which she carried 300 rounds per gun. Her anti-aircraft armament consisted of a single Vickers QF 3 pounder Mk I gun with 500 rounds on a high-angle MKIII mount and a Vickers 2 pounder Mk I gun on a HA Mk I mount with 1000 rounds. Four Maxim guns were also carried with 5000 rounds apiece.Buxton, pp. 74, 77, 235  Wartime modifications  The stern of HMS Lord Clive; showing her BL 18 inch gun on its fixed mounting, November 1918 On board Lord Clive; her BL 18 inch gun is at its full elevation, November 1918 A pair of guns with 200 rounds per gun were added in early 1916 abreast the funnel when it was realized that the two 12 pounder guns were not powerful enough to defend the ship from German destroyers. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of , giving a maximum range of at the maximum elevation of 15¬∞. The maximum rate of fire was six rounds per minute. Two coal bunkers were turned into magazines for them, reducing the range to approximately , and the crew increased in size to 215, necessitating plating in the sides of much of the upper deck to provide quarters. These guns were replaced by four BL Mk IX guns abreast the bridge. They fired a projectile at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of at a rate of ten rounds per minute. The 12 pounder guns were replaced, probably in 1917, by QF Mk I anti-aircraft guns on HA Mk II mounts. They had a muzzle velocity of with a shell and had a range of at an angle of 45¬∞. They had a rate of fire of twenty rounds per minute and 332 rounds per gun were carried for them.Buxton, pp. 72‚Äì74, 234‚Äì35 The biggest change was the addition of a BL Mk I gun in an enormous gun shield mounted abaft the engine room, fixed over the starboard side. The gun itself could traverse 20¬∞, but the gun shield was fixed. The entire mount weighed , but the total weight of the ammunition, equipment and supports nearly doubled this again. This weight so far aft promised to increase the draft at the stern enough that the after inboard compartments of the torpedo bulge, which were normally free-flooding, were closed up, but the ship's draft increased to forward and aft. This corresponded to a displacement of , even after removal of the armored conning tower in compensation. The gun was hydraulically worked, but the ammunition parties had to use muscle power. The shells were stowed below deck and had to be moved by overhead rail to the hatch in the deck behind the gun to be lifted up and loaded. The cordite propellant charges were kept in eighteen steam-heated storage tanks mounted on the forecastle deck abaft the funnel and moved to the gun on a bogie mounted on rails, two one-sixth charges at a time, reducing the rate of fire to about one round every 3‚Äì4 minutes. The interior of the ship was extensively modified to accommodate the larger crew of 278 officers and men, storage and handling gear for the 60 18-inch shells, and to support the weight of the gun mount. Other changes included the transfer of the radio room down into the hold, the addition of a new gyrocompass, enlarging the bridge and rearranging the existing magazines and storage spaces. A pair of two pounder anti-aircraft guns were also mounted on top of the gun shield.Buxton, pp. 73‚Äì74 The guns had a muzzle velocity of with a 8 crh armour-piercing, capped shell and had a range of at an angle of 45¬∞ with a normal charge of . Using the supercharge increased muzzle velocity to and range to .  History = World War I: 1915  After Lord Clive finished working up she was sent to the Thames Estuary on 9 August 1915 to practice bombardment techniques with her sisters and . A replica had been laid out there of some of the principal features of the Belgian coast near Zeebrugge and the ships practised their manoeuvering and spotting arrangements. Two tripods were dropped in the sea, housing observers which could triangulate the fall of shot and signal corrections to the monitors. One problem was that the modified 12-inch gun mounts broke down quite a bit, as they had not been designed to fire at angles up to 30¬∞ and many of their components were quite elderly. The ships were judged ready and a bombardment was planned on 21 August. This had to be postponed for a day because of bad weather, but Lord Clive, her sisters and their supporting armada of ten destroyers, nine minesweepers, the seaplane carrier , four ships to handle the observation tripods, and no less than fifty drifters to handle the explosive anti-submarine nets laid to protect the monitors, sailed to a position about off Zeebrugge during the night of 22‚Äì23 August. Lord Clive anchored and opened fire at 05:36 on the locks of the Zeebrugge Canal that led to the German naval base at Bruges. She fired 31 shells at the locks over an hour and a half before switching targets to a nearby factory which received eleven rounds. Vice Admiral Reginald Bacon ordered the ships to cease-fire after two hours, cancelling the plans to bombard Ostend as well since both Sir John Moore and Prince Rupert had been suffering significant problems with their turrets. The bombardment was fairly ineffectual; two barges were sunk, some buildings damaged, two civilians killed and some German workmen injured, but the locks were not hit. The British judged this a good first try and planned for a bombardment of Ostend once Sir John Moore and Prince Rupert had been repaired.Buxton, p. 54 The operation had to be postponed for weather several times, but the 77-ship fleet, reinforced by the and the small , was in position on the morning of 7 September. Visibility was excellent everywhere but over the target which was covered by a haze, and Admiral Bacon ordered a withdrawal. German submarines and aircraft attacked as they were leaving, but the monitors took no damage. The monitors returned in the afternoon when the haze cleared and Lord Clive opened fire at 15:30 with a ranging shot on the Ostende lighthouse. However an hitherto unknown battery of four long-range guns began to return fire and soon began to near-miss Lord Clive. She steamed out to sea to open up the range, but her speed was so slow that the Germans had no difficulties compensating for the additional range and she was hit four times in quick succession about 15:50. One hit on the port bulge aft, another alongside the bulge forward, one on the bow and another, that failed to explode, on the starboard two-pounder gun, knocking the gun down to the quarterdeck. Only fourteen rounds were fired by the monitors before Admiral Bacon ordered them to retire, one of which set part of the dockyard on fire.Buxton, pp. 55‚Äì56 Another attempt was made on 19 September where the newly arrived monitor attempted to suppress the Tirpitz Battery with her guns, while Lord Clive and Sir John Moore bombarded Ostend from positions thought to be outside the traversing limits of the German battery. This proved not to be the case and she only managed a few rounds before she had to withdraw. On the 25th Lord Clive and several other monitors bombarded German positions at Westende as part of a deception operation to suggest that the Allies were launching an attack in that sector. During the remainder of September and October, she occasionally fired on German coastal batteries. During one of these later shoots Lord Clives left gun burst when a shell prematurely detonated inside the barrel after the gun liner had deformed from the pressure of the large number of rounds fired.Buxton, pp. 56‚Äì57, 224  1916  During December 1915 and January 1916 Lord Clive was stationed in the Thames Estuary to shoot down approaching German Zeppelins with shrapnel shells fired by her main guns, but she was denied a chance to waste ammunition when the Zeppelins never came within range.Buxton, p. 57 She bombarded German batteries at Westende on 26 January using the newly developed air-spotting techniques, but she only fired about eleven rounds during the half-hour bombardment. This was the last bombardment for the next seven months as the monitors were used to support British light forces, minefields and net defenses in the Channel. Lord Clive was refitted during this period with a pair of six-inch guns to enhance her armament against German ships. This came in handy on 8 June when she, along with other monitors and destroyers, rebuffed an attempt by a dozen German ships to clear the nets and sweep the minefields. Lord Clive participated in a deception operation on 8 July when she, as well as French guns, fired blanks to cover the fire of the brand-new 12-inch Dominion Battery at Adinkerke bombarding the Tirpitz Battery. She was fitted with dummy second funnel to make the Germans think that she was a new monitor. The idea was to deceive the Germans as to the true origin of the shells landing around the battery, but the Germans were not totally deceived and retaliated against the French guns. Shortly afterwards they deployed a smokescreen to hide the battery which hampered spotting and they also located the Dominion Battery and fired against it.Buxton, pp. 58‚Äì60 Lord Clive and all of the other monitors of the Dover Patrol simulated preparations for an amphibious landing during the later stages of the Battle of the Somme by firing on German positions at Westende between 8 and 15 September 1916. She fired only 74 rounds during this period as the smaller monitors spent a considerable amount of time acting as offshore aiming marks for the 15-inch monitors. This was the last bombardment of 1916 as the monitors reverted to their role of supporting the Dover Barrage and making anti-destroyer patrols between Calais and The Downs. Lord Clive was given a refit at Southampton during October‚ÄìNovember 1916.Buxton, pp. 60‚Äì61  1917  Lord Clive was modified in March 1917 to handle one of the enormous pontoons, in company with Sir John Moore, planned to be used during the Great Landing. Each of the three pontoons was lashed in position between two monitors and could carry a brigade of infantry, an artillery battery and three tanks.Buxton, p. 62 The plan was to land each pontoon between Westende and Middelkerke to exploit the Allied gains made during the Battle of Passchendaele and pocket German troops between the landing and the advancing troops. Lord Clive and her sisters rehearsed their role up until mid-July when the battle began. But the Allies could not make the ten-mile (16 km) advance necessary to launch the operation and Field Marshal Haig refused to support Admiral Bacon's proposal for a more modest landing in the Nieuport-Middelkerke area in September, so the operation was cancelled on 2 October.Buxton, p. 63  1918  Illustration of Lord Clive by Oscar Parkes, 1918 Lord Clive was drydocked at Plymouth in October and resumed patrols in the Channel before she was taken in hand between 5 December 1917 and 6 April 1918 for modifications to mount the spare 18-inch gun from the large light cruiser , although the gun and mount themselves would not be delivered until 7 September. She bombarded the Tirpitz and Aachen Batteries at Ostend, along with three other monitors, which fired fifty rounds between them during the abortive first attempt to block the Bruges‚ÄìOstend Canal on the night of 11 April. She supported the Inshore Squadron during the First Ostend Raid on 23 April with about fifty rounds of 12-inch and some 6-inch shells. Lord Clive relieved as guardship at Yarmouth for five weeks while the latter was refitted. She arrived at Portsmouth on 16 August to have her 18-inch gun fitted, although it was not shipped until 7 September. She began operational trials with her new gun on 13 October. She fired one round on 14 October at the bridge at Snaeskerke during the morning but received no spotting. She fired another three rounds later in the day but had to cease fire to avoid hitting friendly advancing troops. One round had already been loaded when the order came to cease fire so she fired it, with a reduced charge, into a minefield to seaward.Buxton, p. 64‚Äì68, 74  Peacetime: 1917--1927  Lord Clive was paid off almost immediately after the end of the war and laid up at Immingham. She was towed to Portsmouth in September 1920 to conduct trials with a triple 15-inch gun mount. The Royal Navy had no experience with firing three-gun salvoes from a single turret and wanted to investigate interference between the guns. Her 18-inch gun was removed, along with her secondary armament, and the three guns were installed on the 18-inch mount, covered only by a canvas screen. She recommissioned on 15 December, but she was not ready to conduct the trials until 1 February 1921. She was towed to the Shoeburyness Range for the trials. They revealed no serious problems and she was paid off in August 1921 in Portsmouth.

Political career He was elected in a 1918 by- election held after the death of Robert Roswell Gamey, becoming the first member of his party to sit in the provincial assembly. He was re-elected in the 1919 provincial election in which the UFO staged an upset victory to form a coalition government with Independent Labour MLAs. Bowman was Minister of Lands and Forests in the provincial cabinet from 1920 to 1923. He broke with the majority of UFO MLAs in Ontario following the 1923 provincial election when what had become known as the Progressive Party chose non-farmer William Edgar Raney as its leader. Instead, he and two other UFO MLAs sat as their own rump caucus, apart from the Progressives. Bowman left provincial politics in 1926 to enter federal politics and was elected as a UFO MP for Algoma East to the House of Commons of Canada. In the 1930 federal election, he ran unsuccessfully for re-election as a Liberal candidate in 1930. Later years Bowman later became president of a lumber company in Blind River, Ontario.

She was then taken from her mother and placed in an orphanage at Skene, Aberdeenshire. In her circumstances, she was not permitted to enter further education and had to go into domestic service. While in domestic service she suffered a breakdown and was admitted to the Royal Cornhill Hospital in Aberdeen for a year. After leaving the hospital she spent time living with an elderly woman on a croft in Abriachan. It was there in 1934 while roaming the hills that she met and married Johnnie Kesson, a cattleman. She and her husband were farm workers in North East Scotland from 1939 to 1951; writing from this period illustrates her abiding love of nature and immersion in the changing seasons.A Country Dweller's Years: Nature Writings By Jessie Kesson.

It publishes the journal Ialon-Kad- Nemeton. History Founded in 1936 by Rafig Tullou, Morvan Marchal, and Francis Bayer du Kern, Kredenn Geltiek Hollvedel grew out of the Breton Federalist Movement as an attempt to reassert ancient Celtic religious beliefs. The group's explicit anti-Catholic and Neopagan ideology distinguished it from the existing non-religious Gorsedd of Brittany, from which it emerged as a splinter group. Morvan Marchal was the group's first \\"Arch-Druid.\\" They mixed readings of the Bhagavad Gita and the maxims of Lao Tsu with Celtic traditions to create an Indo-European esotericism as a basis for the re-creation of druidic worship. Esotericist research by Gwilherm Berthou led to claims that ancient Celtic beliefs had been reconstructed. During World War II, its journal, Kad (combat), devoted to druidic philosophy, changed its title to the less militaristic Nemeton (sanctuary). This later became Ialon-Kad-Nemeton. From 1937 onward, the group experienced numerous schisms. The most recent was in 1994, when a faction split and moved to Commana.

It reports to the Belgian Federal Parliament, which appoints and dismisses its members. The Committee I was founded in 1991 and began its work in 1994. It consists of three members, including a Chairperson, who are appointed for a term of five years by the Belgian Chamber of Representatives. This term may be renewed only once. Its members are chosen from among magistrates, senior police officials or persons with significant administrative or scientific experience, however, the Chairperson must be a magistrate. The Chairperson of the Committee I is currently Serge Lipszyc. Oversight duties The Committee I has several oversight responsibilities. The law grants the members of the Committee judicial powers to be able to conduct their investigations to the full: * To launch accountability investigations into aspects of Belgian intelligence work, mostly prompted by but not limited to mishaps. The Committee can choose to open investigations by itself, or be charged to do so by the ministers responsible, or parliament. * To investigate complaints by citizens against the intelligence services and its members (excession of authority, misuse of legitimation, unwarranted consultation of databases). * To act as appeal organ for citizens who feel they have been unjustly refused a security clearance. The Committee is able to overturn the decision. * To exercise control over the use of intrusive and technical surveillance methods: the Committee controls the application of intrusive intelligence means during and after the operation, judging their use for legality, according to a set of criteria which balance the methods used for their proportionality with the threat against which they are used. The Committee has the power to suspend the application of intelligence methods at all times. It also double-checks the permission to use the most intrusive methods (intercepts, hacking, eavesdrops) by a separate commission of magistrates, with the ability to suspend or override the BIM-Commission's refusals. * To check intercepts, imagery recordings and IT-intrusions abroad executed by the Belgian military intelligence service ADIV/SGRS, for which the latter has to present a list of planned intercepts. * To exercise control over the processing of information and personal data stored in the common databases used by the security services, together with the Control Organ for Police Information (COC). * To act as data protection authority for the entire Belgian national security apparatus. * To advise on draft laws, royal decrees, circulars, or any other government document that has legal implications regarding the functioning of the security services, when requested by Parliament or the responsible ministers. * To conduct judicial investigations against members of the intelligence community suspected of having committed a crime, under the purview of the federal prosecution. * To act as expert on intelligence accountability and liaise with foreign oversight bodies.

J. Cronin. It is considered one of the author's finest works and demonstrated a keen understanding of sin. Cronin described the book as \\"a complete dissection of a supreme egoist - a well- intentioned man who, through psychological and sociological influences, develops into a weak and self-indulgent heel who brings disaster on three different women and is himself destroyed by the fourth.\\" Plot The book begins with the story of David Moray, his early career as an ambitious young doctor away on business. He has promised to return to marry a woman he loves, Mary Douglas. Early on in the story he is introduced to successful people and is invited to accompany a prominent family on their ship as their personal physician. In doing so he breaks his promise to Mary and goes in another direction. Instead he briefly marries and divorces Doris, the daughter of the wealthy family he has befriended, whom he indicates was unsound mentally. Later in David's life he is a wealthy, retired Scottish doctor living in Switzerland who is haunted by the memory of Mary. Attempting to go back to an earlier time, and too late, he returns home to seek her out and make amends. He learns that Mary has died and instead encounters her young, penniless daughter, Kathy, who is involved in mission work. He indulges in a friendship which evolves into more. Logically doubtful and not believing he can have a life with Kathy, David marries Frida, a countess whom he does not love. Not reading a letter Kathy sent, he is unaware Kathy believes they are soon to reunite. Awaiting their departure for a honeymoon cruise his ruminations are interrupted by a brief thought of the unopened letter. He then overhears his butler speaking to Kathy, who has just made a difficult journey to reach him. Overwhelmed that he could have been with her on his own terms at this location and not the mission, he is at a loss for words - David cannot explain that he has just married someone. Frida asks to speak to Kathy alone, explaining that David found her by seeking her mother whom he failed to return for, and that David would never have returned to help her in her mission as a doctor. He needed a woman who would be strong enough to master him. Underestimating the reaction, Kathy runs out into the night to her accidental death. Kathy was betrayed more by David's cynicism, doubt and lack of courage than by the ambition that detoured him years earlier, although that is still evidently present in his choosing a countess for social advantages. In the end, distraught in his loss, David looks outward toward the garden and a Judas tree comes into focus. Dramatically he has not only failed his first love, but also her daughter, resulting in her death. It is not so much ironic as it is illustrative of the span of time in which he has made similar choices with consequences. The following morning his butler sees his body hanging from the tree. Previously in the book, a Judas tree was referred to as \\"The Tree of Lost Souls.\\" Some might assume David has realized at the end that he is a lost soul after having inflicted such misery on others due to his lack of morality. Others might infer the character is moral, clearly having a suffering conscience, and in hindsight merely took steps in the wrong direction.  Theme  Betrayal is the dominant theme of The Judas Tree. Here despite and because of the protagonist, a pattern of betrayal is repeated. David betrayed Mary, Doris, his religion, and himself. These betrayals demanded - in Cronin's narrative - the ultimate price, which is death.  Film versions  The 1975 Hindi film, Mausam, directed by Gulzar and starring Sharmila Tagore and Sanjeev Kumar, is loosely based on Cronin's novel.

His origin is North Arcot district of Tamil Nadu, from where his father migrated to Tuticorin to work in shipping business. He was born in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu. From early 1960s to the 1980s; he was one of the most powerful mob bosses in Bombay, along with Haji Mastan and Karim Lala.  Underworld career  Varadarajan was born in Tuticorin (Tamilnadu) in 1926 He moved to Bombay in 1945. Working as a porter at VT Station, he began his criminal life by stealing dock cargo. Varada, as he was fondly called, was hugely popular among the poor Tamil residents in the Dharavi slums. He used the massive Dharavi slums as a safe haven to expand his criminal activities into an underworld empire of extortion, kidnapping, contract killing, land encroachment, illegal gambling and liquor dens, manufacturing illicit liquor and bootlegging. Varada had total control over the distribution racket of illicit liquor. In the early 1980s, after Haji Mastan gave up his smuggling operations and Karim Lala's Pathan gang was weakened by a split between Samad Khan and Dawood Ibrahim, Varadarajan emerged as a powerful contender in the Mumbai underworld. Varadarajan ran a parallel judicial system within the Tamil community in his strongholds. Starting the 1980s, police officer Y.C. Pawar targeted Varadarajan Mudaliar. Most of his gang members were eliminated or imprisoned. His illegal gambling and liquor dens were closed down and finally by the end of 1983, Varadarajan was forced to abandon his underworld empire and flee from Mumbai to Tamil Nadu.  Personal life  While a porter at VT Station, Varadarajan began offering food to the poor at the nearby dargah of Bismillah Shah Baba and kept the tradition up as his fortunes rose. His opulent pandals at Matunga station during the annual Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations were quite famous and visited by celebrities. However, after the collapse of the cotton mills in Mumbai in the mid-1980s, their relevance ended. During the period of Varadarajan's fading influence, his hugely popular Ganapathi pandal was served an eviction notice at the behest of the police in the mid-1980s.

His work marks the beginning of Baroque sculpture in Germany. Life Petel was born in Weilheim, Bavaria, about forty kilometres south-west of Munich, the son of Clement Petle (or Betle -alternative spellings), a cabinetmaker. He grew up an orphan as both his parents died when he was a small child. Bartholom√§us Steinle, a local carver, became his guardian and was his first master. Petel learned ivory carving in the court cabinet-making studio of Christoph Angermair in Munich. At the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, he left Germany and became an itinerant craftsman. In 1620/21 he met Peter Paul Rubens in Antwerp who was an important influence. He later travelled via Paris to Rome.Georg Petel. Bildhauer im 30-j√§hrigen Krieg on www.kunstaspekte.de In Rome he copied both antique and modern works. Here he also met Anthony van Dyck and Fran√ßois Duquesnoy, the leading Flemish representatives of the Baroque in respectively painting and sculpture in Rome. He resided in Genoa from 1622 to 1624 where he received many commissions from local noble families. He was regarded by his patrons as the greatest ivory carver of his time. He subsequently travelled to Livorno, where he made studies after Pietro Tacca‚Äôs bronze Slaves, which is part of the monument to Ferdinand I de‚Äô Medici on the Piazza della Darsena. He returned to Antwerp in 1624 where he visited Rubens again.Johannes Ramharter. \\"Petel, Georg.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 17 May. 2014. In late 1624 Petel returned to Germany where he settled in Augsburg. Here he would reside for the remainder of his life apart from occasional trips to the Southern Netherlands. During one of these trips he made a bust of Rubens which, in its spontaneity, recalls the work of Gianlorenzo Bernini. Van Dyck also painted his portrait on one of these visits to Antwerp although the portrait may also have been painted earlier in Rome (around 1622-23).David Freedberg, 'Van Dyck and Virginio Cesarini: A Contribution to the Study of Van Dyck's Roman Sojourns' Petel probably died of the plague in Augsburg at the age of 34. Work Saint Sebastian Adam and Eve at the Rubenshuis, Antwerp Death archer Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris The so-called Weilheim school of his home town, the study of the antique and influences of contemporary sculptors of Italy all influenced Petel's style. Petel did not orient himself solely on late-Mannerist and Baroque sculpture. He also adopted ideas from contemporary painting such as that of Rubens. Rubens' type of the crucified Christ with arms raised very high were translated by Petel to his ivory statuettes. This style was well suited to ivory carving, as it allowed the figure to be made in a single piece. He carved the ivory crucifix, discovered recently at the Carmelite convent in Pontoise, when he was in Paris in 1621 at the age of just nineteen. The influence of Rubens and the study of nature allowed him to transcend the Mannerist tendencies in sculpture. His \\"St. Mary Magdalene\\" in Regensburg Niederm√ºnster anticipated the High Baroque of Bernini. During his repeated visits to Rubens in Antwerp, he produced after Rubens' designs some of his most famous small sculptures such as \\"Venus and Cupid\\" (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), freely adapted from the Aphrodite of Cnidus but in its soft modelling closer in style to Rubens.'Venus and Cupid' at the Ashmolean Museum Inspired by Rubens' sketches was also a salt container with the \\"Triumph of Venus\\" (Stockholm Palace). Its concise composition and soft, sensual modelling make it a supreme achievement in Petel‚Äôs ivory work. His statue of a Saint Christopher for the St Moritz Church in Augsburg also references an altarpiece of the 'Deposition' by Rubens of 1611 (in the Antwerp Cathedral). This statue served as the model for many 17th-century representations of the saint in southern Germany. In 1631 he made a life-size limewood statue of 'Salvator mundi' for the altar of the St Moritz Church in Augsburg.Statue of 'Salvator mundi' for the altar of the St Moritz Church in Augsburg Petel also created figures of saints and in particular Saint Sebastian, who was regarded as a protector against the plague.Saint Sebastian at the St Moritz Church in Augsburg He chose subjects from mythology and pioneered an earthy eroticism in his treatment of these subjects. He worked mainly in wood and ivory but was no less skilled in bronze. He worked equally well on large as small formats. He prepared his sculptures carefully using wax models and drawings. Examples of his work can be found in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna; the Residenz Museum, Munich; St. Moritz Church, Augsburg and the Bavarian National Museum in Munich.

It was designed by Bertram Mackennal and built from 1927 to 1929 by Dorman Long & Co. It is also known as Martin Place Memorial and The Cenotaph. It is one of the oldest World War I monuments in central Sydney. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 11 November 2009. The cenotaph takes the form of a monolithic stone block in a sepulchral shape. At its two shorter ends stand two bronze statues, a soldier and a sailor guarding the cenotaph. Words are carved into the longer faces of the cenotaph: on the southern side, facing the General Post Office, the carving reads: \\"To Our Glorious Dead\\"; on the northern side, facing Challis House, it reads: \\"Lest We Forget.\\" Remembrance events are frequently held at the Cenotaph. Most importantly, it is the centre for Sydney's main Anzac and Armistice Day dawn service ceremonies, regularly drawing thousands of attendees.  History  In 1914, Australia volunteered to help the United Kingdom when it declared war, and despatched troops to fight in what soon became known as the Great War. Australians fought in the Middle East and Europe. Casualties were severe. By the time of the Armistice in November 1918, of a total of 331,781 enlistments who had embarked for overseas, 215,585 service personnel, a proportion of nearly 65%, had become casualties. Many of these men had died rather than being wounded.Scott, 1941, p 874 Grief was widespread across the community. Development of the Cenotaph Due to a delay in the completion of the Anzac Memorial in Hyde Park, the Cenotaph was built in Martin Place to serve the needs of people who needed a focus for commemoration and mourning for the sacrifices of the Great War. In November 1924, the Sunday Times reported a plea by Fred Davison, a senior RSL member. He advocated building a memorial in Martin Place where so many appeals and recruiting rallies had been held during the war, and where so many commemorative events had been held since the end of the war. Hugh D. McIntosh, proprietor of the Sunday Times persuaded the new Premier Jack Lang in 1925 to set aside to erect a cenotaph. Unlike most other war memorials in Australia, the Martin Place Cenotaph, meaning \\"empty tomb\\", does not name individuals, but instead mourns and commemorates the communal sacrifice of lives lost at war. It was based an Australian reworking of a new type of memorial developed in London by Edwin Lutyens for Whitehall in 1919 as a 'tomb on pylon, inscribed only with words composed by the Prime Minister, Lloyd George, \\"The Glorious Dead\\" '. Installed temporarily to be saluted by troops of the empire during the victory march through London on 19 July 1919, the London Cenotaph spoke so powerfully to bereaved people that Lutyens had to make it again in stone'.Inglis, 1999. It was unusual for the NSW Government to fund a war memorial, since almost all memorials were organised and funded by voluntary committees rather than by government. However, Lang had opposed conscription during the war and had been involved in anti-imperialist movements. Promoting a new image of himself and his government as 'the Soldier's Friend' was one response to the growing strength of veterans' organisations.Inglis, 1999. Positioned where so many recruiting rallies and wartime events occurred, the Cenotaph was directly linked to the events of the Great War. The \\"Memorial Committee\\" of the State Government, City Council and ex-service organisations oversaw the project. A proposed competition to design the Cenotaph did not eventuate because Lang instead approached sculptor Sir Bertram Mackennal when he was visiting Sydney from England and commissioned him to undertake the work. A contract was signed with Mackennal on 9 March 1926.Tranter, 2004. p 102. Mackennal had designed the tomb of Edward VII at Windsor and the medals for the Olympic Games of 1908. He also constructed the statues of Cardinal Patrick Moran and Archbishop Michael Kelly which stand at the southern end of St Mary's Cathedral.Franki, 2000. =Design elements= For the Cenotaph in Martin Place, Mackennal designed a \\"chunky rectangular form guarded by a soldier and sailor\\".Inglis, 1999. It was a more modest version of a sculpture he had designed for a cenotaph in Brisbane, which was never built. It was disliked by some critics at that time, such as Building magazine's George Taylor who charged that it was \\"a mere tombstone for people to put wreaths up against\\". The artist Margaret Preston admired the \\"stern simplicity\\" of the stone slab but objected to the realism of the servicemen. Mackennnal's depiction may have been influenced by the sculpture designed for the Royal Artillery Memorial in London by Charles Sargeant Jagger, whose figures were also realistic rather than stylised.Inglis, 1999. The designs for the figures were also criticised for being \\"at ease\\" without their arms reversed - the normal mourning stance for military personnel at memorial ceremonies. Mackennal responded: \\"Memorial not a tomb. Figures not mourning. Guarding altar of remembrance.\\". In the words of Ken Inglis 'it may have been the very blankness of Mackennal's Cenotaph... that allowed so many people over the years to feel comforted in its presence'.Inglis, 1999. In March 1927, Mackennal arranged for Dorman Long & Co to erect the granite pedestal and John Bradfield (who was on the Memorial Committee) to supervise. There were 23 stones in the pedestal all carefully arranged so that any white or black markings would not be noticeable.NSW Public Works Department, 1927, p 55. The main block of granite came from the Moruya quarry of Dorman Long & Co, where on 9 July 1927, Bradfield oversaw the cutting of the granite. All the dressing and lettering was completed at Moruya by Bill Benzie and Mr Joe Wallace. Italian stonemason Fueravante Cadiccio came to Sydney to erect it.Raxworthy, 1989, pp 91-2. State Records NSW holds photographs of the granite block being prepared at Moruya.NSW NRS 12685 Similarly, there are photographs of the positioning of the main slab with a block and tackle using Yale Spur-geared Blocks.Mitchell Library SV1/MON/CEN/1 & 2 The monument was designed with the images of two servicemen cast in bronze on either side of a central plinth, topped by a bronze wreath. They were modelled on two real returned servicemen. The soldier was based on Private William Pigott Darby who had served at Gallipoli while the sailor was based on Leading Signalman John William Varcoe who had served in the RAN.Inglis, 1999. Darby was born on 25 April 1872 in Monasterevin, Ireland. He served in the United States Army during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and in 1914 then enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) at Toowoomba. He was actually 42 and not 38 as he stated on the form, presumably if he was over 40, he would not have been accepted into the army. He was part of the Anzac force that landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, the morning of his 43rd birthday and served as a stretcher-bearer with 15 Infantry Battalion and later 4 Field Ambulance. He was part of the Anzac force that served at The Somme, where he was blown up and deafened in a shell explosion on 12 August 1916. He returned to Australia in January 1918 and was discharged as a Lance Sergeant, ending his AIF service as a medical orderly at the military hospital at Randwick. He died in Queensland at the age of 63.Furphy, 1999Register of War Memorials in NSW online Leading Seaman John William Varcoe, RAN, was born at Bakers Swamp in 1897. He entered the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) on 3 June 1913 and trained in Training Ship Tingara. Varcoe was drafted to and before joining the destroyer in 1917. By then a signalman, he served in Parramatta until 20 July 1919. The destroyer was one of six RAN River Class destroyers based at Brindisi, Italy. On 15 November 1917, an Italian steamer, Orione, was torpedoed while on passage from Valona to Brindisi. Parramatta took Orione in tow and, while setting up the tow, the two ships were again attacked by a submarine. Parramatta continued with the tow until relieved by a tug. Varcoe had been aboard Orione and for his efforts in maintaining communications he was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal. He was discharged from the Navy at Sydney on 8 April 1928. =Dedication and official opening= A ceremony of dedication had been held on 8 August 1927. The completed memorial was officially unveiled by NSW Premier Thomas Bavin on 21 February 1929 with a speech by Sir John Monash.The Sydney Morning Herald, 22 February 1929, pp 12, 16. Made of granite, it weighs . Origins of the dawn service The Dawn Service arose from events during the erection of the Cenotaph. At dawn on Anzac Day, 25 April 1927, five returned men happened upon an elderly woman laying a wreath at the still incomplete Cenotaph. Impressed by the solemnity of the moment, they convinced the secretary of the Australian Legion (E. A. Rushbrook MBE) to conduct an official service at dawn at the Sydney Cenotaph on 25 April 1928. Conceived as an opportunity to lay wreaths and remember the Anzacs in silence, it began at 4.30 am, the time when the first Anzacs landed at Gallipoli. It was not advertised but attracted 150 people in its first year. Public interest encouraged the organisers to invite the president of the Returned Soldiers' Sailors' Imperial League of Australia (later renamed the Returned & Services League or RSL), Dean Talbot, to offer a prayer at the service. By 1930 a crowd of 2,000 attended and a bugler was added. The following year, the Governor's presence made the dawn service even more official. Most of these elements are retained in the Anzac Day Dawn Service at Sydney's Cenotaph, which still attracts large crowds every year.Government Architect's CMP for the Anzac Memorial, 2007. When historian Charles Bean attended the 1931 Dawn Service at Wellington, he observed that holding the service at this time was appropriate since dawn was usually the hour when the major battles of the Great War had commenced. The idea of the Dawn Service has been extended to other states as well. The rising sun with its promise of a bright new day, the memory of the tension of waiting for the whistle blast that signalled the order to advance and the badge which Australian soldiers of the AIF wore on their slouch hats brings a complex imagery into play at every Dawn Service. Since the first Anzac Day ceremony was held at the Cenotaph in 1928, it began to emerge as the major focus for mourning and commemoration in NSW. The Cenotaph has gained a sacrosanct place in the history of war memorial services in NSW. Furthermore, it is not only a focus for Australian mourning and memory. Visiting dignitaries often place wreaths on the Cenotaph. On 4 July 1942, for instance, US troops stationed in Australia laid wreaths on the Cenotaph on the US Independence Day, in memory of the US troops who died in the defence of the Philippines.AWM photo, P00561.001 - P00561.009SLV photo H.2000.200.1441 A proposal to add sculptures of an airman and a nurse in 1962 did not come to fruition. Many people, even former aircrew, agreed that it was more powerful as a simple symbol for all rather than as naturalistic representations of everyone who had served. Another proposal in 1954 to shift the Cenotaph came to nothing, though some chains were installed around it and the plinth was enlarged. A City Council photo of 11 August 1966 showed bollards had been installed by this date.NSCA CRS 48/5593 Peace groups and feminist organisations opposed to aspects of the Anzac legend from the 1970s onwards have focused their protests on the Cenotaph at Martin Place. The conversion of Martin Place into a pedestrian plaza from the 1960s onwards reduced threats to the monument from traffic.  Description  The Cenotaph in Martin Place is a restrained memorial designed as a granite altar with a bronze serviceman at each end. The altar stone, quarried in Moruya in 1927, is 3.05m long, 1.65m wide and 1.25m high sitting above a 970mm stepped base, which runs east to west following the street alignment of Martin Place. It is positioned directly over the Tank Stream which flows in an underground channel beneath it. The larger than life size sculptures of servicemen at the east and west ends are by Australian expatriot sculptor Bertram Mackennal and stand on Moruya granite plinths. The eastern sculpture is of an infantryman from Gallipoli, Private William Pigot Derby, the western is a RAN signalman, John William Varcoe. Both are depicted realistically, wearing their uniforms, packs and carrying weapons. The men stand in the \\"at ease\\" position, guarding the Cenotaph. On the top of the altar is a bronze wreath. The servicemen each face a flagpole approximately 3m from the monument. The north face of the cenotaph is inscribed on its north face, \\"TO OUR GLORIOUS DEAD\\" (similar to the words used in the London Cenotaph at Whitehall, 'the glorious dead'). On the south face are the words: \\"LEST WE FORGET\\". The Cenotaph and flagpoles is narrowly enclosed by a low fence of metal bollards linked by a metal chain. A white poplar tree was planted several metres from either end of the Cenotaph during the 1970s.  Condition  As at 20 July 2009, Excellent physical condition. Minor modifications  Modifications and dates  Bollards and chains around cenotaph apparently added by Sydney City Council in the 1950s. Populus alba were planted on the axis of the Cenotaph at eastern and western ends 1970s. The statues Detail of the soldier statue, with the General Post Office in the background The model for the soldier was Private William Pigott Darby from the 15th Infantry Battalion (Gallipoli & the Western Front; wounded at Pozi√®res) and 4th Field Ambulance AIF. A native of Monasterevin, Ireland (born 25 April 1872), he died in Brisbane on 15 November 1935. The model for the sailor was Leading Seaman John William Varcoe. He enlisted on 3 June 1913, served on (1914‚Äì1916) in German East Africa and on (1917‚Äì1919). He was awarded the Commonwealth Distinguished Service Medal in 1918 (one of 60 Australians to earn this honour) and died in October 1948.  Heritage listing  As at 12 November 2009, The Cenotaph is of State historical significance for its embodiment of collective grief at the loss of life by Australian servicemen in World War I. It is also of historical significance to the State for its role in inaugurating the \\"Dawn Service\\" on Anzac Day in 1929, the year it was opened, a tradition now observed on Anzac Day throughout Australia. Unlike most other war memorials in Australia, the Cenotaph, meaning \\"empty tomb\\", does not name individuals, but instead mourns and commemorates the communal sacrifice of lives lost at war. This makes it both representative and rare as a war memorial. The Cenotaph is of State significance for its historical association with those who lost their lives at war and with those who have mourned them. It is of State aesthetic significance as an Australian reworking of the British prototype cenotaph developed by Edwin Lutyens for Whitehall in 1919, and as an example of the monumental sculpture work of Bertram Mackennal. Its design shows restrained symbolism in the simple granite altar guarded by two servicemen. The Cenotaph is of State social significance as a powerful focal point for memorial services in NSW associated with all wars and conflicts. Cenotaph was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 11 November 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Cenotaph is of State historical significance for its embodiment of collective grief at the loss of Australian servicemen and women's lives in World War I. It provides compelling evidence of the impact of the Great War on the people of NSW. The Cenotaph is also of historical significance for its role in inaugurating the \\"Dawn Service\\" on Anzac Day in 1928, the year it was opened, a tradition now observed on Anzac Day throughout Australia and internationally (for example, at Gallipoli in Turkey). Unlike most other war memorials in Australia, the Cenotaph, meaning \\"empty tomb\\", does not name individuals, but instead mourns and commemorates the communal sacrifice of lives lost at war. Positioned in Martin Place where so many recruiting rallies and wartime events occurred, the Cenotaph is physically and symbolically linked to the Australian experience of the Great War. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Cenotaph of State significance for its historical association with the servicemen and women whose loss of life has been commemorated in services focused on it since 1928. It is also of State significance for its association with the people and organisations that have commemorated those lives lost at war, especially the Returned Servicemen's League (RSL), which maintains a custodial role over the monument. Prominent individuals associated with the Cenotaph include its sculptor, Bertram Mackennal (the first Australian-born artist to be knighted), JJ Bradfield who supervised its erection and the NSW premier JT Lang whose government funded it. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Cenotaph is of State significance as an Australian reworking of the British prototype cenotaph developed by Edwin Lutyens for Whitehall in 1919. It is also significant as a well-known, restrained example of the monumental sculpture work of Bertram Mackennal. The design of this \\"altar of remembrance\\", as Mackennal described it, is unusual in its simplicity - a rectangular block of granite, flanked by realistic, slightly larger than life sized figures depicting a soldier and a sailor, standing guard. Although initially criticized for its simple sculptural qualities, 'it may have been the very blankness of Mackennal's Cenotaph . . . that allowed so many people over the years to feel comforted in its presence'. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Cenotaph is of State social significance for its long- time role as a ceremonial focus for memorial services by numerous veterans' organizations, individuals and groups representing civilians affected by war. Its role in the inauguration of the Dawn Service, a major part of every Anzac Day ceremony, enhances its association with a deeply felt strand of popular remembrance. Positioned in a pedestrian thoroughfare in Sydney's central business district it maintains a solemn reminder of the sacrifices that Australians have made at war. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It does not appear to meet this criterion of State significance. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Cenotaph is of State significance for its rarity in NSW as a war memorial that does not name individuals, but instead mourns and commemorates the communal sacrifice of lives lost at war. It is also rare as the only war memorial to be positioned in Martin Place, where historical gatherings concerning Australian war efforts have been typically held, for example recruitment drives and victory day celebrations. It is also rare as a memorial which was commissioned by the State Government rather than by a local community. Along with the Anzac Memorial in Hyde Park, the Cenotaph is widely regarded as a principal monument in NSW to the servicemen and women who died on active service in war. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Cenotaph is of State significance for its representative role as one of the most prominent war memorials in NSW. The Cenotaph occupies a mid-way position between major State monuments (such as the Anzac Memorial in Sydney's Hyde Park or the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne) and the innumerable small town memorials erected by local communities across Australia. Unlike them, it does not commemorate the death of specific individuals but memorializes the sacrifices made by all who served.

Surface temperature inversion is typical of polar environments and leads to the katabatic wind phenomenon. The vertical temperature structure of polar environments tends to be more complex than in mid-latitude or tropical climates. History=Beginnings The collection of polar meteorology data started in 1893 with Fridtjof Nansen during his North Pole expedition. One of the goals of the expedition was to make detailed meteorological and early oceanographic measurements. The measurements made from Nansen‚Äôs ship, which was named Fram, were used by Vagn Walfrid Ekman to develop the theory of the turning of surface flow with friction (the Ekman spiral). Cold War The Cold War acted as a catalyst for progress in polar meteorology. Balloon instruments along the northern borders of the US and Canada were used for atmospheric profiling. North America‚Äôs air defenses often used instruments carried on balloons to profile the Arctic. Nuclear submarines, which the United States used as a defense mechanism, were equipped with upward looking sonar. The data were later declassified and between 1958-1979 became the baseline for assessing the thinning of ice from the 1980s to the present day. Russia also contributed highly accurate data between 1937 and 1991. Present day Today, submarine mapping and measurements have been drastically reduced. One classic way to measuring ice thickness is to drill a hole in the ice and analyze the ice obtained. There are also many more complex methods and devices dedicated to measuring and keeping track of weather conditions in polar areas. These include ice mass balance buoys, upward looking sonar from under-ice buoys, and satellites. Global warming has increased interest in polar meteorology. This is because most of Earth's snow and ice are in polar regions, and these areas are expected to be the most affected by the snow/ice- surface albedo feedback effect. Therefore, if increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration causes global warming, then polar regions should warm faster than other locations on Earth. Topics of interest=Atmosphere sea ice/ocean interaction Interaction between the atmosphere, ice and ocean is confined to the atmospheric boundary layer, which is mainly influenced by surface characteristics. In polar regions, these are sea ice roughness and sea ice concentration, which greatly influence surface temperature distribution. Wind speed and direction, the temperature of the air, and the location of the wind contact are other factors. Both sea ice and wind have great impact on the atmospheric boundary layer, which is often used to measure conditions in polar areas.  Polar clouds and precipitation  The atmospheric portion of the hydrological cycle in polar regions plays an important role in that: * the balance of polar ice masses is inseparably linked to precipitation, * clouds modify the radiation transfer, * the release of latent heat modifies the temperature of the air, hence circulations. Carbon dioxide and methane Carbon dioxide (C02) is of particular interest in polar meteorology because it affects the melting of sea ice. Human activity releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning oil, coal and natural gas. A dozen pounds of Arctic sea ice disappears for every pound of carbon dioxide released. This highlights the heating power of carbon dioxide, which pumps 100,000 times more energy into our climate than was given off when the oil, coal or natural gas was burned. White Arctic ice, currently at its lowest level in recent history, is causing more absorption. Prof Wadhams, in a recent BBC article, calculates that this absorption of the sun's rays is having an effect \\"the equivalent of about 20 years of additional CO2 being added by man\\". The Cambridge University expert says that the Arctic ice cap is \\"heading for oblivion\\". Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, introduces a significant positive feedback as global warming leads to the retreat of vast permafrost regions in the northern hemisphere. As permafrost retreats, more areas become emitters of methane. Estimations of the methane emissions from northern swamps vary strongly due to (1) the extensive variability of methane emission between and within different swamp areas, (2) the very limited knowledge of these fluxes for various types of soils, and (3) the lack of representative data for vast areas like the enormous swamps, e.g., in Sibiria. Recent advances now allow sensors to directly measure turbulent methane fluxes from naturally emitting surfaces. A fast response methane sensor can also be installed in research aircraft, like the Polar 5 airplane of the Alfred Wegener Institute.

It arose from the discovery of a callus on a tree in Hong Kah, which appears monkey-like. Some believe the image to be of divine origin, while others have attributed the phenomenon to the effects of pareidolia, whereby random stimuli are perceived as meaningful. The callus has initiated a minor social mania, drawing large crowds to look or pray at the tree. History=Beginnings The phenomenon started on 12 September 2007 when an unknown person put up a sign in Chinese on a tree on Jurong West Street 42. The sign read that a monkey had come to the tree three years ago to look for his father, the Monkey God. It added that a recent car accident had split the old bark of the tree open, releasing the Monkey God. One resident purported that the monkey image appeared around 3 September 2007. The appearance of the sign and the monkey outline on the tree trunk were reported in the local English and Chinese-language newspapers such as The New Paper, The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao. Reports also quoted residents claiming how three car accidents had earlier happened at the spot, but none had been fatal, purportedly due to the tree's \\"magical\\" properties. Since news broke on 13 September 2007, hundreds of people from all over Singapore have flocked to the usually quiet HDB neighbourhood to pay homage to the tree. By the afternoon of 13 September, the crowd visiting the tree had swelled to more than 30, with offerings occupying the grass patch surrounding the tree. Monkey outline The tree with the monkey outline is a species of the African Mahogany. It is a common tree planted by the National Parks Board (NParks) to provide shade, particularly in parks and along major roads and expressways. It is a hardy tree that grows well under most soil conditions. On the trunk of the tree in question is an outline of two monkeys -- one larger than the other -- with limbs, faces and bodies. They were formed on a surface that is smoother and of a slightly lighter colour than the rest of the trunk. Some people claimed to see three monkeys. NParks gave a plausible explanation for how the monkey outline could have been formed: The tree was involved in several minor accidents over the years. The uneven bark surface at the base of the tree trunk was the result of callusing, a natural reaction in which the tree grows new bark over injured areas. The department of biological sciences at the National University of Singapore explained that patterns formed by callusing are random and depend on the damage caused by the accidents. It added that the monkey outline on the smoother bark may disappear with time as the new tissue layers form under it and push this layer out. Subsequently, the smooth surface would get darker and rougher, like the rest of the tree bark. Public mania Devotees to the tree believed that the images are either a manifestation of Sun Wukong, a deity from Chinese mythology, or Hanuman, the monkey deity in the Hindu pantheon, and that praying to them would bring them luck. The crowd has been leaving bunches of bananas, packets of peanuts, oranges and chrysanthemum flowers, burning joss sticks, and praying for lucky 4-D numbers at the tree. People also started burning incense paper, prompting a resident to place a zinc barrel beside the tree so that the ashes could be scooped into the barrel. Some residents even won a bet on the 4-D draw held on 12 September. The winning number \\"4309\\" was obtained by combining the HDB block number near the tree (430) and the order of the Monkey in the Chinese zodiac (ninth). There were volunteers who helped to distribute the bananas and peanuts to people who drop by. Some of them have also put up signs telling people not to leave red packets filled with money beneath the tree. A visitor had left a tin can containing tiny rolls of paper at the tree. Thousands of people have since visited the tree, and the crowd grew to over 200 at one point on the afternoon of 14 September. The crowd consisted of both men and women, mostly Chinese and Indians of all ages. The people wanted a peek of the monkey images, while many took pictures of the tree with their mobile phones. Images of the monkey tree were even sold at S$3 or S$10 a photograph near the tree. The crowds were so large that residents started complaining of the noise, littering and traffic jams caused by vehicles parked illegally along the narrow road. This prompted the police to patrol the area. Two nearby trees also started garnering offerings from 14 September -- one for a supposed outline of Guan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy, on its trunk, and another whose bark resembles the Hindu elephant god Ganesha. Sociological explanations Many experts interviewed by The Straits Times thought that the phenomenon could be a case of \\"believing is seeing\\". A sociologist from the National University of Singapore explained that \\"those who believe in divine objects are mostly those who follow a simple faith which is founded in tangible evidences of the sacred\\". He referred to the believers who, in May 2006, flocked to the mountains of Mexico's southern Chiapas state where a rock with an image that resembles Jesus Christ was discovered. Another sociologist pointed out that \\"these objects are called fetishes or 'objects that are imbued with deep symbolic significance to become sacred objects that embody gods and spirits'.\\" In the monkey tree's case, it was because of a \\"natural transformation of its material appearance that reminds people of an important legend\\", and \\"this form of worship is actually basic to human religious behaviour\\".

The uniting concept of the series is that each novel combines two storylines, one set in present- day Russia (in 1995 to 2005), and a related one set in the Russian Empire (in the 1670s, 1790s, and 1860s). *2001: Altyn Tolobas (1995, 1675‚Äì76), , *2003: Extracurricular Reading (2001, 1795), , , *2006: F.M. (2006, 1865), *2009: The Falcon and the Swallow (2009, 1702) Altyn Tolobas Nicholas is the grandson of Erast Fandorin, born in ca. 1960. His father was Alexander Fandorin (1920‚Äì1994), born in British exile where his pregnant mother had fled from the Russian Civil War. Nicholas has a master's degree in history, specializing in the 19th century history of the Russian Empire, and (in Altyn Tolobas) visits the land of his ancestors for the first time in 1995, after the fall of the Soviet Union, tracing the founder of the Russian Fandorins, a Swabian musketeer Cornelius von Dorn who took service with the Tsar in 1675, and died in the 1682 Moscow uprising, nine generations removed from Nicholas. Extracurricular Reading Extracurricular Reading is set in 2001, six years after the events of the preceding novel. Nicholas is now married to and has two children with Altyn Mamaeva, whom he met in 1995. He has abandoned his British citizenship for a Russian passport. As in the preceding novel, Nicholas' current-day adventures are told in parallel with the story of one of his ancestors, in this case Daniel Vondorin Mithridates Karpov (Samson Vondorin), the 4th and 5th Fandorins after Cornelius, set in the final year of the reign (and life) of Catherine the Great. The connecting theme of the two stories surrounds the responsibilities of fatherhood. Nicholas Fandorin is involved in a series of crimes in which his children, and the child of one of the involved New Russian businessmen, are threatened; Mithridates is a child prodigy whose father has aspirations at court, but the boy becomes aware of a plot against the empress' life and has to escape. Each chapter of the novel is titled after, and contains some literary allusion to, a classic of Russian or world literature. F.M. In F.M., Nicholas seeks a lost manuscript of (F.M.) Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. The 19th-century story is told from the point of view of Porfiry Petrovich, the detective in Dostoevsky's novel, set in the decade predating the setting of the first Erast Fandorin novel. The Falcon and the Swallow Nicholas Fandorin, at the height of the financial crisis of 2009, travels on the Atlantic in the luxury cruise liner Falcon. The Swallow, meanwhile, is a light frigate which travelled the same waters in the year 1702. Nicholas has received from his British aunt Cynthia a manuscript by the hand of one Appin, which he finds out is really Laetitia von Dorn, a niece of captain Cornelius von Dorn, which turns out to lead to a hidden treasure. Laetitia in 1702, disguised as a man, is in search of the same, then-recently hidden, treasure.

This term is usually used in the context of super computing and highly parallel computing. In this context it is used as a benchmarking algorithm, i.e. to provide a comparative measurement of speed for different computers. LU reduction is a special parallelized version of an LU decomposition algorithm, an example can be found in (Guitart 2001). The parallelized version usually distributes the work for a matrix row to a single processor and synchronizes the result with the whole matrix (Escribano 2000).  Sources  * J. Oliver, J. Guitart, E.

Probably from Tang Dynasty China, the mirror is decorated with bas-relief flowers, insects and a variety of real and mythological animals. It is almost identical to a mirror held by the Shosoin Treasury in Nara. The mirror itself is preserved at the Nara National Museum. Furthermore, the shrine also has a ceramic Koseto pair of komainu, standing 17.6 and 17.9 centimeters high.

The recapitulation begins in the subdominant, D minor, and most of the recapitulation's second group is in A major before a short coda returns to the minor mode for the movement's ending. II. Allegretto quasi andantino E major. A five-part rondo with an unconventional key scheme as follows: A (E major) ‚Üí B (C major) ‚Üí A (F major) ‚Üí C (D minor) ‚Üí A (E major) Schubert also composes brief transitions at the ends of each episode--that between the B section and the medial A section features a small amount of the B section's material in F major (the medial A section's key), while that between the C section and the final A section modulates from the C section's D minor up a tone to E minor, and then sits on its dominant for a few measures before the return to the movement's tonic key with the final A section. The movement ends with a short coda that is completely diatonic. III. Allegro vivace A minor. In sonata form without development (the exposition modulates to E major, and the recapitulation then begins in E minor and moves to A major). Ends in the parallel major The work takes approximately 20 minutes to perform. Daniel Coren has summarised the nature of the recapitulation in the last movement of this sonata.

When his Protestant cousin became King Henry IV of France in 1589, he raised the hopes of Catholics hostile to the League and was a candidate for the crown of France.

The coat of arms of Charles of Bourbon-Vendome. Born August 19, 1562 at Gandelus-en-Brie, Charles was the son of Louis I de Bourbon-Conde, Prince of Conde (uncle of French King Henry IV) and Duke of Enghien, and Eleonore de Roye. He was the nephew of Cardinal Charles de Bourbon.The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church: Consistory of December 12, 1583 (VII) Biography He did not receive priestly ordination. Elected coadjutor archbishop of Rouen with right of succession on 1 August 1582, he did not receive episcopal consecration. He was created cardinal deacon by Pope Gregory XIII in the consistory of December 12, 1583, but he did not receive the red hat or a titular church. He was known as the Cardinal de Vend√¥me (the name of the branch of the Bourbon family which he came). He was advisor to King Henry III of France. He was a director of the diocese of Bayeux from 1586 to 1590. In 1589 he was appointed abbot of Saint-Denis in commendam. He also held the commendams of the abbeys of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, Saint-Ouen in Rouen, Bourgueil, St. Catherine of Rouen, St. Pierre of Corbie and Ourscamp. During the events of the League, he chose, unlike his brothers, to follow his uncle, Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon in his action against the Protestants. He showed himself unfavorable to Henry I, Duke of Guise and according to historian Jacques Auguste de Thou was allegedly used by King Henry III to break the influence that Lorraine had over the Cardinal de Bourbon. In 1588, he participated in the Estates General of Blois. The principal is the government which remained in Tours during the vacancy of the throne after the death of Henry III. He recognized Henry IV as king and momentarily became Minister of Justice before the king, who feared the ambition of his young cousin's withdraws. When his uncle died in 1590, he became known as Cardinal de Bourbon. He was appointed archbishop of Rouen (May 9, 1590) in succession to his uncle, but the cathedral chapter refused to acknowledge him. Only after the siege by Henry IV was he accepted. He offered himself as candidate for the throne of France and formed the third party in which were grouped many Catholic nobles unhappy not to see Henry IV to convert to Catholicism. The political interest in the person of Cardinal in 1593, was one of the factors that prompted Henry to convert. He did not participate in any of the five papal conclaves held while he was a cardinal: 1585 to elect Pope Sixtus V, 1590 to elect Urban VII, 1590 to elect Gregory XIV, 1591 to elect Innocent IX, or 1592 to elect Clement VIII. He died July 30, 1594 of dropsy at the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. He is buried in the monastery of Gaillon.

For c=0 these two differential equations reduce to the equations satisfied by the associated Legendre polynomials. For c e 0, the angular spheroidal wave functions can be expanded as a series of Legendre functions.

Splitting the beam allows its use for multiple purposes simultaneously. The thinness of the mirror practically eliminates beam or image doubling due to a non- coincident weak second reflection from the nominally non-reflecting surface, a problem with mirror-type beam splitters.  In photography  In photography, the pellicle mirror has been employed in single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras, at first to enable through-the-lens exposure measurement and possibly to reduce camera shake, but later most successfully to enable fast series photography, which otherwise would be slowed down by the movement of the reflex mirror, while maintaining constant finder vision. The first use of pellicle mirrors for consumer photography however were in color separation cameras. The Devin Tricolor Camera from at least the 1938 version used two pellicle mirrors plus three color filters to split the image from a single lens into three images of the three additive primary colors. Pellicle mirrors are ideal for this purpose, even today, since they are lighter and cheaper than an optical block of dichroic prisms, which would be heavy and expensive for large, high resolution film or plates. The conventional SLR camera has a reflex mirror directing the light beam from the lens to the focusing screen in the viewfinder, which is swung out of the light path when the exposure is made and causing the viewfinder to go dark. This action adds a delay between pressing the shutter release and the actual exposure of the film. The first camera to employ the pellicle mirror as a beam splitter for the viewfinder was the Canon Pellix, launched by Canon Camera Company Inc. Japan in 1965. The object was to accomplish exposure measurement through the lens (TTL), which was pioneered by Tokyo Kogaku KK, Japan in the 1963 Topcon RE Super. That employed a CdS meter cell placed behind the reflex mirror that had narrow slits cut into the surface to let the light reach the cell. Canon improved on the idea by making the mirror semi-translucent and fixed. The meter cell was swung into the light-path behind the mirror by operating a lever on the right-hand camera front for stopped down exposure reading, momentarily dimming the viewfinder. Two thirds of the light from the camera lens was let through the mirror, while the rest was reflected up to the viewfinder screen. The Pellix pellicle mirror was an ultra-thin (0.02 mm) Mylar film with a vapour deposited semi reflecting layer. Since there was no mirror blackout, the user could see the image at the moment of exposure. The next 35mm SLR camera to employ the pellicle mirror was the Canon F-1 High Speed, made available in the event of the 1972 Olympic games, the object being rapid series photography, difficult at the time to obtain with a moving mirror. The mirror design was the same as in the Pellix. In 1984, Canon released another version of their then \\"New F-1\\", which attained a record 14 frames per second performance, being the fastest analog SLR of that time. Nippon Kogaku KK, Japan introduced their high-speed Nikon F2H in 1976. The mirror is a pellicle rather than a conventional front surfaced mirror that swings out of the light path when the exposure is made. To identify the F2H, note the shutter speed dial has no T, B or 1/2000; has no self-timer and has a non-removable Type B focusing screen. Two further Canon models were produced with pellicle mirrors, the EOS RT and the EOS-1N RS, the RT being based on the EOS 600/EOS 630 and the 1N RS being based on the EOS-1N. As development of SLR cameras has progressed since these early models, fast sequence shooting has apparently become possible using ordinary moving mirrors in high-speed cameras, getting rid of the vulnerable pellicle mirror that was prone to dust and dirt. The mirror mechanism of conventional SLR cameras has improved since the Pellix mirror was introduced; the viewfinder is dark for only a very short time, the shutter lag is small, and the mirror-return is fast enough for rapid shooting. Digital SLR cameras are able to take ten frames or more per second employing an instant-return mirror.  Sony SLT concept  Sony has introduced cameras with plasticSecrets of the Sony A55 pellicle-like mirrors, which it describes as \\"Single-Lens Translucent\\" cameras. These cameras divert a portion of incoming light to a phase-detection autofocus unit, while the remaining light strikes a digital image sensor. Sony \\"SLT\\" cameras employ an electronic viewfinder (EVF) allowing exposure value, white balance and other settings to be verified and adjusted visually before taking a picture, although typically the EVF displays far less dynamic range than the sensor. The refresh rate of the viewfinder is limited by the time it takes the sensor to make a usable exposure; thus in low light the frame rate of the viewfinder may be as low as four frames per second. \\"SLT\\" cameras also lack a real-time view at high shooting rates, when the viewfinder shows the last picture taken instead of the one being taken ‚Äî a phenomenon comparable to certain older SLRs that can only achieve their maximum burst rate in mirror lock-up. Motion-picture cameras Few film movie cameras have been made that make use of the pellicle mirror. Probably the earliest is the Path√© WEBO M, m for membrane, of 1946. With that camera light is reflexed sideways into a primary plano-convex finder lens, the plane side being partially or fully matted. Another French amateur movie camera with a pellicle is the Christen Reflex for Double-Eight film. It was made from 1960 on and provides a lightly slanted deflection. Later, in 1967, the professional Mitchell NCR and BNCR cameras were equipped with a pellicle-based finder. In the Soviet Union in 1970 appeared the Kiev 16 Alpha, also featuring a pellicle mirror finder system that deflects strictly vertically.  Advantages and disadvantages  Advantages of a pellicle mirror: * The user has an uninterrupted view through the viewfinder while making an exposure. * There is no vibration from mirror movement, reducing shake and audible noise. At the same time, the system is devoid of play or backlash. * Shutter lag may be diminished, and pictures taken at a faster rate, compared to systems employing a reflex mirror. * Continuous phase-detection autofocus during video, live view or continuous shooting mode. Disadvantages of a pellicle mirror: * The pellicle mirror causes an up to 1/3-stop loss of light at the receptor, and a corresponding 2-stop loss of light in the viewfinder * The mirror has to be kept perfectly clean, or the light sensor and other electronics (as well as the image quality) will suffer. * Owing to its thinness, the pellicle mirror is fragile, making it difficult to clean. * As the viewfinder does not go dark, there is no visual indication that the shutter has fired. This could be a problem in a noisy environment where the shutter cannot be heard.

Cohn, also at Rockefeller University. Steinman was one of the recipients of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Early life and education Ralph Steinman was born into an Ashkenazi Jewish family in Montreal, one of four children of Irving Steinman (d. 1995), a haberdasher, and Nettie Steinman (n√©e Takefman, 1917‚Äì2016). The family soon moved to Sherbrooke, where the father opened and ran a small clothing store \\"Mozart's\\". After graduating from Sherbrooke High School, Steinman moved back to Montreal, where he stayed with his maternal grandparents Nathan and Eva Takefman. He received a bachelor of science degree from McGill University and received his M.D. (magna cum laude) in 1968 from Harvard Medical School. He completed his internship and residency at Massachusetts General Hospital. Awards On October 3, 2011, the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine announced that he had received one-half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for \\"his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity\\". The other half went to Bruce Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann, for \\"their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity\\". However, the committee was not aware that he had died three days earlier, on September 30, from pancreatic cancer. This created a complication, since the statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that the prize is not to be awarded posthumously. After deliberation, the committee decided that as the decision to award the prize \\"was made in good faith\\", it would remain unchanged. Steinman's daughter said that he had joked the previous week with his family about staying alive until the prize announcement. Steinman said: \\"I know I have got to hold out for that. They don't give it to you if you have passed away. I got to hold out for that.\\" Steinman had received numerous other awards and recognitions for his lifelong work on dendritic cells, such as the Albert Lasker Award For Basic Medical Research (2007), the Gairdner Foundation International Award (2003), and the Cancer Research Institute William B. Coley Award (1998). In addition, he was made a member of Institute of Medicine (U.S.; elected 2002) and the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.; elected 2001). In 2016, the city of Sherbrooke, Quebec, where Steinman lived during his childhood, named a new street rue Ralph Steinman, in honor of the only Sherbrooke native ever to win a Nobel Prize.

Hoffmann) Research Immunology tries to understand resistance to infection. Infections are first resisted by innate immunity, followed by adaptive immunity, which has memory, so can prevent reinfection. Two questions that immunologists ask: 1) By what mechanisms do innate and adaptive resistance come about? 2) How do these mechanisms contribute to other fields of medicine such as cancer, allergy, autoimmunity, etc.? In the 20th century, two theories arose: 1) Macrophages contribute to innate resistance through phagocytosis and intracellular killing 2) Antibodies mediate adaptive resistance by neutralizing microbial toxins. Steinman discovered that dendritic cells link innate to adaptive immunity, including adaptive T cell-mediated immunity. He studied the initiation of antibody responses in tissue culture in the laboratory. As shown, he found out that antigens, lymphocytes, and \\"accessory cells\\" together create immune responses. Accessory cells contain a new cell type with probing cell process or \\"dendrites\\". These cells proved to be the missing link between innate and adaptive immunity. Several features were used to identify and purify dendritic cells from mouse spleen. Because dendritic cells were discovered among \\"adherent\\" accessory cells (i.e. those that attach to tissue culture surfaces), they had to be distinguished from macrophages, whose hallmarks were persistent phagocytosis and adherence to tissue culture surfaces. However, Steinman found that dendritic cells had a different morphology and expressed different molecules from macrophages. For example, they did not express FcR- receptors, but did express major components of the major histocompatibility complex II and did not adhere to surfaces or exploit phagocytosis. Macrophages, though, showed the opposite characteristics. The study was carried out in collaboration with Zanvil A. Cohn, who studied resistance to infectious diseases, especially the biology of macrophages. Some general features of T cell responses that are initiated by dendritic cells (DCs): * Adaptive immunity develops in two stages: DCs present antigens and initiate the afferent limb, while the other antigen-presenting cells (APCs) mediate the effectors to eliminate the antigen or infection. * In tissue cultures, immunity develops in clusters of DCs and lymphocytes. The onset of adaptive immunity could actually be observed in vitro. * DCs were therefore considered \\"nature's adjuvants\\" for T cell immunity, meaning they helped induce T cells. * DCs can produce protective substances such as cytokines, interferons, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides. * DCs can mobilize innate lymphocytes such as natural killer cells (which in turn produce cytokines or kill target cells upon recognition). However, unlike macrophages, DCs do not phagocytose or kill microbes. DCs capture, process and present antigens: * Some receptors such as FcR death receptor can activate or inhibit DC function. * Antigen processing and presentation of proteins and lipids seems efficient and can include cross presentation on MHC I and CD1. * Uptake and processing are regulated by environmental stimuli. * In vivo, dendritic cells process antigens to form peptide-MHC complexes in the steady state, especially in lymphoid organs. * Most DCs in vivo in the steady state are immature, able to take up and present antigens, but areunable to adaptive T cell immunity. * Environmental stimuli, e.g., microbial products, alter or mature DCs and/or act together with DCs to control the formation of different types of helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory types of T cells. * Maturing DCs also carry out innate responses, particularly the formation of cytokines and chemokines. * Maturation links are innate to adaptive immunity; and control the quality of the response that develops in DCs and lymphocytes that recognize presented antigens. * The term \\"subset\\" refers to distinct DCs with different receptors for antigen uptake and maturation, and distinct functions in innate and adaptive immunity. They reside in the peripheral organs and induce different forms of antigen-specific peripheral tolerance. Antigens from the periphery are captured by DCs in lymphoid tissues, even in steady (not matured) state. In steady state, DCs induce tolerance so that DC maturation can lead to immunity to microbial antigen, but maturing DCs capture microbial, as well as self dying cells, thus resulting in autoreactivity and chronic inflammation.

The connections and pathways of the internet could be seen as the pathways of neurons and synapses in a global brain The global brain is a neuroscience- inspired and futurological vision of the planetary information and communications technology network that interconnects all humans and their technological artifacts. As this network stores ever more information, takes over ever more functions of coordination and communication from traditional organizations, and becomes increasingly intelligent, it increasingly plays the role of a brain for the planet Earth. Basic ideas Proponents of the global brain hypothesis claim that the Internet increasingly ties its users together into a single information processing system that functions as part of the collective nervous system of the planet. The intelligence of this network is collective or distributed: it is not centralized or localized in any particular individual, organization or computer system. Therefore, no one can command or control it. Rather, it self-organizes or emerges from the dynamic networks of interactions between its components. This is a property typical of complex adaptive systems. The World Wide Web in particular resembles the organization of a brain with its web pages (playing a role similar to neurons) connected by hyperlinks (playing a role similar to synapses), together forming an associative network along which information propagates. This analogy becomes stronger with the rise of social media, such as Facebook, where links between personal pages represent relationships in a social network along which information propagates from person to person. Such propagation is similar to the spreading activation that neural networks in the brain use to process information in a parallel, distributed manner. History Although some of the underlying ideas were already expressed by Nikola Tesla in the late 19th century and were written about by many others before him, the term ‚Äúglobal brain‚Äù was coined in 1982 by Peter Russell in his book The Global Brain. How the Internet might be developed to achieve this was set out in 1986. The first peer-reviewed article on the subject was published by Gottfried Mayer-Kress in 1995, while the first algorithms that could turn the world-wide web into a collectively intelligent network were proposed by Francis Heylighen and Johan Bollen in 1996. Reviewing the strands of intellectual history that contributed to the global brain hypothesis, Francis Heylighen distinguishes four perspectives: ‚Äúorganicism‚Äù, ‚Äúencyclopedism‚Äù, ‚Äúemergentism‚Äù and ‚Äúevolutionary cybernetics‚Äù. He asserts that these developed in relative independence but now are converging in his own scientific re-formulation.  Organicism  In the 19th century, the sociologist Herbert Spencer saw society as a social organism and reflected about its need for a nervous system. Entomologist William Wheeler developed the concept of the ant colony as a spatially extended organism, and in the 1930s he coined the term superorganism to describe such an entity. This concept was later adopted by thinkers such as Gregory Stock in his book Metaman and Joel de Rosnay to describe planetary society as a superorganism. The mental aspects of such an organic system at the planetary level were perhaps first broadly elaborated by palaeontologist and Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. In 1945, he described a coming ‚Äúplanetisation‚Äù of humanity, which he saw as the next phase of accelerating human ‚Äúsocialisation‚Äù. Teilhard described both socialization and planetization as irreversible, irresistible processes of macrobiological development culminating in the emergence of a noosphere, or global mind (see Emergentism below). The more recent living systems theory describes both organisms and social systems in terms of the \\"critical subsystems\\" (\\"organs\\") they need to contain in order to survive, such as an internal transport system, a resource reserve, and a decision-making system. This theory has inspired several thinkers, including Peter Russell and Francis Heylighen to define the global brain as the network of information processing subsystems for the planetary social system.  Encyclopedism  In the perspective of encyclopedism, the emphasis is on developing a universal knowledge network. The first systematic attempt to create such an integrated system of the world's knowledge was the 18th century Encyclop√©die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. However, by the end of the 19th century, the amount of knowledge had become too large to be published in a single synthetic volume. To tackle this problem, Paul Otlet founded the science of documentation, now called information science. In the 1930s he envisaged a World Wide Web-like system of associations between documents and telecommunication links that would make all the world's knowledge available immediately to anybody. H. G. Wells proposed a similar vision of a collaboratively developed world encyclopedia that would be constantly updated by a global university-like institution. He called this a World Brain, as it would function as a continuously updated memory for the planet, although the image of humanity acting informally as a more organic global brain is a recurring motif in other of his works. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, too, was inspired by the free-associative possibilities of the brain for his invention. The brain can link different kinds of information without any apparent link otherwise; Berners-Lee thought that computers could become much more powerful if they could imitate this functioning, i.e. make links between any arbitrary piece of information. The most powerful implementation of encyclopedism to date is Wikipedia, which integrates the associative powers of the world-wide-web with the collective intelligence of its millions of contributors, approaching the ideal of a global memory. The Semantic web, also first proposed by Berners-Lee, is a system of protocols to make the pieces of knowledge and their links readable by machines, so that they could be used to make automatic inferences, thus providing this brain-like network with some capacity for autonomous \\"thinking\\" or reflection.  Emergentism  This approach focuses on the emergent aspects of the evolution and development of complexity, including the spiritual, psychological, and moral-ethical aspects of the global brain, and is at present the most speculative approach. The global brain is here seen as a natural and emergent process of planetary evolutionary development. Here again Pierre Teilhard de Chardin attempted a synthesis of science, social values, and religion in his The Phenomenon of Man, which argues that the telos (drive, purpose) of universal evolutionary process is the development of greater levels of both complexity and consciousness. Teilhard proposed that if life persists then planetization, as a biological process producing a global brain, would necessarily also produce a global mind, a new level of planetary consciousness and a technologically supported network of thoughts which he called the noosphere. Teilhard's proposed technological layer for the noosphere can be interpreted as an early anticipation of the Internet and the Web. Physicist and philosopher Peter Russell elaborates a similar view, and stresses the importance of personal spiritual growth, in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging superorganism. This approach is most popular in New Age circles, which emphasize growth in consciousness rather than scientific modelling or the implementation of technological and social systems. Evolutionary cybernetics Systems theorists and cyberneticists commonly describe the emergence of a higher order system in evolutionary development as a ‚Äúmetasystem transition‚Äù (a concept introduced by Valentin Turchin) or a ‚Äúmajor evolutionary transition‚Äù. Such a metasystem consists of a group of subsystems that work together in a coordinated, goal-directed manner. It is as such much more powerful and intelligent than its constituent systems. Francis Heylighen has argued that the global brain is an emerging metasystem with respect to the level of individual human intelligence, and investigated the specific evolutionary mechanisms that promote this transition In this scenario, the Internet fulfils the role of the network of ‚Äúnerves‚Äù that interconnect the subsystems and thus coordinates their activity. The cybernetic approach makes it possible to develop mathematical models and simulations of the processes of self- organization through which such coordination and collective intelligence emerges.  Recent developments  In 1994 Kevin Kelly, in his popular book Out of Control, posited the emergence of a \\"hive mind\\" from a discussion of cybernetics and evolutionary biology. In 1996, Francis Heylighen and Ben Goertzel founded the Global Brain group, a discussion forum grouping most of the researchers that had been working on the subject of the global brain to further investigate this phenomenon. The group organized the first international conference on the topic in 2001 at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. After a period of relative neglect, the Global Brain idea has recently seen a resurgence in interest, in part due to talks given on the topic by Tim O'Reilly, the Internet forecaster who popularized the term Web 2.0, and Yuri Milner, the social media investor. In January 2012, the Global Brain Institute (GBI) was founded at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel to develop a mathematical theory of the ‚Äúbrainlike‚Äù propagation of information across the Internet. In the same year, Thomas W. Malone and collaborators from the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence have started to explore how the global brain could be ‚Äúprogrammed‚Äù to work more effectively, using mechanisms of collective intelligence. The complexity scientist Dirk Helbing and his NervousNet group have recently started developing a \\"Planetary Nervous System\\", which includes a \\"Global Participatory Platform\\", as part of the large-scale FuturICT project, thus preparing some of the groundwork for a Global Brain. In July 2017 Elon Musk founded the company Neuralink, which aims to create a Neural Lace, which is a concept invented by the novelist Iain M. Banks and basically refers to a machine interface woven into the brain, to allow the user to access all available human information. A core driver behind this business idea is Musk's argument that human beings soon have to embrace brain implants to stay relevant in a world which, he believes, will soon be dominated by artificial intelligence. The firm raised $27m from 12 Investors in 2017 . Criticisms A common criticism of the idea that humanity would become directed by a global brain is that this would reduce individual diversity and freedom, and lead to mass surveillance. This criticism is inspired by totalitarian forms of government, as exemplified by George Orwell's character of \\"Big Brother\\". It is also inspired by the analogy between collective intelligence or swarm intelligence and insect societies, such as beehives and ant colonies, in which individuals are essentially interchangeable. In a more extreme view, the global brain has been compared with the Borg, the race of collectively thinking cyborgs conceived by the Star Trek science fiction franchise. Global brain theorists reply that the emergence of distributed intelligence would lead to the exact opposite of this vision. The reason is that effective collective intelligence requires diversity of opinion, decentralization and individual independence, as demonstrated by James Surowiecki in his book The Wisdom of Crowds. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.

Location The broch stands on a low rocky islet (the \\"Holm of Hebrista\\") in West Burra Firth. The site is inaccessible without a boat except at very low tide. There was once a causeway from the islet to the shore, which is no longer readily apparent. Description The broch is in a ruined state with much fallen debris. The entrance is blocked with stones but the lintel over the inner end is still apparent. There appear to be two guard cells on either side of the entrance passage. Internally four mural cells can be seen, two of which are dumb-bell shaped with short passages between the two halves. The site is a scheduled monument. Later history The Orkneyinga saga states of Magnus Erlendsson and H√°kon Paulsson: :\\"Magnus and H√°kon ruled their lands and defended them for some time, the two agreeing very well... They also slew a famous man, named √ûorbj√∂rn in Borgarfj√∂r√∞ in Hjaltland.\\"Joseph Anderson, (1873), The Orkneyinga saga. Translated by J√≥n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Chapter 35 (page 60) Borgarfj√∂r√∞, the \\"fjord of the borg\\" was so named by the Norse on account of the broch. It is probable that the reason of √ûorbj√∂rn's connection with Borgarfj√∂r√∞/Burra Firth was its affording him, and his followers a shelter, and a defensive position in the borg, or broch. The old name Borgarfj√∂r√∞ occurs in a document in the Norse language dated 1299. The broch was visited by George Low in the 18th century, when he noted a number of cells in the base of the wall, and he stated that a hollow, galleried wall began above these.
