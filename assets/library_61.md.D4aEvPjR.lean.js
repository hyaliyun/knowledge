He served four terms and a minor part of his fifth term as a United States Representative from Pennsylvania, for from January 3, 2011, to January 3, 2019, and for from January 3 to January 23, 2019. A member of the Republican Party, Marino was the United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania in his early career. On September 1, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Marino to be Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, commonly known as the \\"drug czar\\". He withdrew on October 17, 2017, following reports that he had been the chief architect behind a bill that protected pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors and crippled the DEA's ability to combat the U.S. opioid epidemic. Two weeks after being sworn in for his fifth term, Marino announced his resignation from Congress, effective January 23, 2019, to work in the private sector. Early life and education Marino was born on August 13, 1952, and raised in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. After graduating from high school, Marino went to work in the factories of central Pennsylvania. At age 30, Marino enrolled in the former Williamsport Area Community College (now Pennsylvania College of Technology). Marino would then transfer to Lycoming College, where he graduated magna cum laude, before completing his J.D. degree at Dickinson School of Law. Law career After beginning his legal career in private practice, Marino served as a Lycoming County District Attorney from 1992 to 2002. In 2002, Marino was appointed the United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania by President George W. Bush. During his tenure as U.S. Attorney, Marino led the prosecution of executives of Rite Aid for criminal fraud. The company's former president pleaded guilty to conspiring to inflate income by $1.6 billion and conspiring to obstruct justice. In 2007, Marino resigned from his role as U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In 2007, the new U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Peter Smith, confirmed that neither Marino, nor his office, were ever under review or investigation. U.S. House of Representatives=District Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district, located in central and northeastern Pennsylvania, includes Bradford County, Juniata County, Lycoming County, Mifflin County, Pike County, Snyder County, Sullivan County, Susquehanna County, Union County, Wayne County, and portions of Perry County, Tioga County, Lackawanna County, Monroe County, and Northumberland County. Elections ;2010 In 2010, Marino decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Chris Carney of Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district. He won the three-candidate Republican primary with 41% of the vote, defeating Dave Madeira (31%) and Snyder County Commissioner Malcolm Derk (28%). On November 2, 2010, Marino defeated Carney 55-45%. ;2012 In 2012, Marino won re-election to a second term, defeating Democratic nominee Philip Scollo 66%‚Äì34%. ;2014 In 2014, Marino faced off against Independent Nick Troiano and Democrat Scott Brion. Marino garnered 62% of the vote with Troiano received 13% and Brion received 25%. Tenure Marino ranked third among Pennsylvania's congressional delegation in Americans for Prosperity's 2012 scorecard (70%) and fifth in the Club for Growth's 2012 scorecard (63%). Committees * Committee on the Judiciary ** Chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law **Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet * Committee on Foreign Affairs **Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific ** Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia * Committee on Homeland Security ** Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies ** Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications (Vice Chair) Marino was a member of the House Baltic Caucus. Resignation After a court-ordered redistricting, Marino's district was renumbered as the 12th District ahead of the 2018 elections. It lost its suburban territory closer to Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, in the process losing its last connection to longtime congressman Joseph McDade, who represented the district from 1961 to 1999. To make up for the loss in population, it was pushed slightly westward to take in State College, home to Penn State. The new district was no less Republican than its predecessor, and Marino easily won a fifth term, defeating Democrat Marc Friedenberg with 66 percent of the vote. On January 17, 2019, two weeks after being sworn in for a new term, Marino announced his resignation from the House, to be effective January 23, 2019. Marino described his decision to resign as follows: \\"Having spent over two decades serving the public, I have chosen to take a position in the private sector where I can use both my legal and business experience to create jobs around the nation.\\" Marino's resignation required a special election to be called by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf via a writ of election within 10 days of Marino's resignation becoming effective on January 23, 2019. Per Pennsylvania law, the special election had to occur no fewer than 60 days following the gubernatorial proclamation being made. On May 21, 2019, Republican Fred Keller won the special election with 68.1% of the vote, defeating his previous 2018 Democratic opponent Marc Freidenberg, and succeeded Marino in Congress. Political positions Marino supported the death penalty. He believed that the mentally ill and criminals should not be able to obtain guns. In July 2013, Marino voted against Justin Amash's amendment #413 to H.R. 2397 \\"To end authority for the blanket collection of records under the Patriot Act and bar the NSA and other agencies from using Section 215 of the Patriot Act to collect records, including telephone call records, that pertain to persons who are not subject to an investigation under Section 215.\\" In 2011, Marino became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261, also known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.Bill H.R.3261 Pharmaceuticals In October 2017, The Washington Post and 60 Minutes reported that Marino was the chief advocate of a 2016 bill that hobbled the ability of the Drug Enforcement Administration to combat the opioid epidemic. Marino introduced the bill, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, in 2014 and again in 2015; it failed both times. The 2014 version was opposed by the DEA and the Justice Department, but the 2015 version was sold as an attempt to \\"work with the pharmaceutical companies\\" and was subject to heavy lobbying. A similar version introduced in the Senate by Orrin Hatch passed both houses of Congress by unanimous consent and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on April 19, 2016. The legislation aimed to weaken the DEA's authority to take enforcement action against drug distributors who supplied unscrupulous physician and pharmacists with opioids for diversion to the black market. Previously, the DEA had fined individuals who profited on suspicious sales of painkillers and repeatedly ignored warnings that the painkillers were sold illegally. The new legislation would have made it \\"virtually impossible\\" for the DEA to stop these sales, according to internal agency documents, Justice Department documents, and the DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge John J. Mulrooney II. Marino, whose district was heavily affected by the opioid epidemic, declined to comment on the reports. The drug industry spent at least $102 million lobbying Congress on the legislation between 2014 and 2016. McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health spent $13 million lobbying in support of the bill. When Joseph Rannazzisi, the chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)'s Office of Diversion Control, strongly criticized the bill, Marino and his cosponsor Marsha Blackburn demanded that the drug diversion enforcer be investigated by the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General. Nothing came of the investigation but Rannazzisi was removed from his position in August and retired in October 2015. According to The New York Times, Blackburn's best known legislation was that bill which revised the legal standard that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) had used to establish that \\"a significant and present risk of death or serious bodily harm that is more likely than not to occur,\\" rather than the previous tougher standard of \\"imminent danger,\\" before suspending the manufacturer's opioid drug shipments. The legislation was criticized in internal Justice Department documents, and by the DEA's chief administrative law judge, as hampering DEA enforcement actions against drug distribution companies engaging in black-market sales. Rannazzisi said he informed Blackburn's staffers precisely what the effects would be as a result of the passage of a 2016 law the two sponsored, as national awareness grew regarding a crisis in the prescriptions of opioids in the United States. Blackburn admitted her bill had what she characterized as unforeseen ‚Äúunintended consequences,‚Äù but Rannazzisi said they should have been anticipated. He said that during a July 2014 conference call he informed congressional staffers the bill would cause more difficulties for the DEA if it pursued corporations which were illegally distributing such drugs.Ex-DEA official says Blackburn had warning on opioid law, Jonathan Mattise, October 26, 2018. Retrieved August 14, 2019. Office of National Drug Control Policy In September 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Marino to serve as the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (\\"drug czar\\"). In October, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) called on Trump to withdraw Marino's nomination. Trump said he would \\"look into\\" reports about Marino, putting his nomination in question. On October 17, 2017, Marino withdrew his nomination. 2016 Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee In 2016, Marino was a announced as a member of then President-Elect Donald Trump's presidential transition team. The transition team was a group of around 100 aides, policy experts, government affairs officials, and former government officials who were tasked with vetting, interviewing, and recommending individuals for top cabinet and staff roles in Trump's administration. According to Fox News, he was part of the team's executive committee. Personal life Marino resides outside Williamsport, Pennsylvania, with his wife, Edie, and his two children. In February 2019, Marino said health issues led to his January resignation from Congress. Multiple battles with kidney cancer have left Marino with only part of one kidney, and after another kidney problem required surgery, he made his decision to resign.

History The duo's name, \\"The Knocks\\", refers to the early days in their career when neighbors would knock on their door for playing music too loudly.They posted an \\"Origins\\" video on YouTube explaining in more detail. Before focusing on their own music and remixes, they were producing beats and remixes for the likes of Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Mobb Deep, Nikki Minaj, Marina & the Diamonds, Flo Rida, Sky Ferreira, Theophilus London, Ellie Goulding, and others. NME magazine named The Knocks as one of the \\"20 hottest producers in music\\" in 2010, and the group was featured frequently in New York Posts \\"Popwrap\\" the same year. 2010‚Äì15: Magic, Comfortable and So Classic EPs Their single \\"Make It Better\\", released in 2010 on Neon Gold Records, was used in the US for a nationally televised Corona campaign. Their 2010 single \\"Dancing with the DJ\\" was an instant online success. Philadelphia hip hop band Chiddy Bang sampled The Knocks' \\"Blackout\\" for their single \\"Here We Go\\" (featuring Q-Tip) from their EP The Preview. Chiddy Bang subsequently sampled The Knocks' \\"When You've Got Music\\" and \\"Dancing with the DJ\\" for their mixtape Peanut Butter and Swelly. After the success of \\"Dancing With The DJ\\", their debut extended play, titled Magic was released in 2011. In 2012, their cover of \\"Midnight City\\" by M83 featuring vocals by Mandy Lee, had 10,000 downloads in its first week on the website SoundCloud. In June, the duo took the number one spot on the website HypeMachine with the track \\"Learn to Fly\\", which reached 100,000 plays on SoundCloud within a week of its release. \\"Geronimo\\", a collaboration with French producer Fred Falke, was released on Kitsun√© Records in July 2012. Later on in November 2012, the duo were featured alongside pop sensation St Lucia in Icona Pop's song \\"Sun Goes Down\\", which was released through their debut album Icona Pop. It was later revealed that the song was the duo's very first feature and co-produced track. Afterwards, the duo released another successful single, featuring St. Lucia, titled \\"Modern Hearts\\", in the beginning of 2013 and earned the group another number-one placing on HypeMachine and reached the 100,000 plays mark on SoundCloud in four days. Within the same year, another single, titled \\"Comfortable\\", which featured vocals from X Ambassadors, was released, which was the made the lead single of their second extended play, also titled \\"Comfortable\\", and that was released shortly afterwards. In 2014, The Knocks released a single on Neon Gold Records/Big Beat Records, \\"Classic\\", featuring alt-pop duo POWERS. An official video was released that paid homage to video game The Sims. After it was released, they released a \\"Powers Sunset Version\\" which followed on shortly afterwards. This followed the songs \\"Dancing with Myself\\", \\"Collect My Love\\", featuring Alex Newell, and \\"Time\\" being released in early 2015. These tracks made up their third EP, titled So Classic, which was released in April 2015. 2015‚Äì16: 55 In November 2015, it was reported that The Knocks' debut album, titled 55, was to be released in January 2016, but was delayed to a later date sometime within the early months of the year. 55 features collaborations with Fetty Wap, Cam'ron, Wyclef Jean, Carly Rae Jepsen, Matthew Koma, Magic Man, Alex Newell, POWERS, Phoebe Ryan, Justin Tranter, Walk the Moon, and X Ambassadors. Work for the album began to show in August 2015, when the single \\"Classic\\", released for their So Classic EP, was re-mastered and released as a 2015 re-release, adding new feature vocals from Fetty Wap along with POWERS. Afterwards, the duo went on to uploading a brand new music video for their collaboration with Alex Newell, titled \\"Collect My Love\\" and was classed as the second re-release from their So Classic EP. Both songs from the EP were considered to be a part of the new album at the time. In the late months of 2015, The Knocks released a new single which was the first song outside of the So Classic EP and other projects that they had previously work on, which sparked much interest about whether or not the duo was working on a new project. It was titled \\"I Wish (My Taylor Swift)\\" and was collaborated with Matthew Koma. It was eventually released in September 2015. The trailer for their debut album was released on their YouTube channel in November 2015, announcing it under the title 55. This teased the release of another single, titled \\"New York City\\", featuring vocals from Cam'ron, and was released the following month. Also in the same month, they re-released their official video for their 2013 single \\"Comfortable\\", featuring vocals from X Ambassadors, which was originally released under their 2013 Comfortable EP, and was classed as being another 2015 re-release. Afterwards, in 2016, other projects also began to take place, such as their American \\"Route 55\\" Tour, which started on 15 January and ended on 13 February. Also, their first remix of the year was also released which was of Taylor Swift's single \\"Welcome to New York\\", taken from her album 1989. This was made the last bootleg of their \\"Summer Bootleg Series\\" which was released on SoundCloud. Remixes included Carly Rae Jepsen and her single \\"All That\\", and Skrillex and Diplo's collaborative single \\"Where Are √ú Now\\", featuring Justin Bieber. Away from the announcements of such projects, before the release of their collaboration with Wyclef Jean, they announced further that the duo were made executive producers for Jean's 2016 album. Their first single of the year, titled \\"Kiss The Sky\\", featuring vocals from Wyclef Jean, was released in January 2016. During the premiere of the track, it was reported afterwards that the release date for the debut album 55 was confirmed to be 4 March 2016. This was followed on by the track listings from the album being released with single \\"Comfortable\\", featuring X Ambassadors, confirmed to also be on the album. This was also among all tracks from the So Classic EP being confirmed as songs on the album, as well as the collaborations with Matthew, Cam'ron and Wyclef. During their tour in late January, the duo were interviewed by The Daily Nebraskan, stating news about the album 55. B-Roc, who makes up one half of the duo, stated, \\"I think the new album is similar to our So Classic EP. That's a good representation of what the album will be like.\\" He also added that, \\"We didn't get to meet Fetty Wap, but Carly Rae was cool. Every artist we featured we previously had worked with or knew someone who knew them. The label didn't put them on our record; we wanted them on there.\\" After the tour in February, they announced that the duo is hoping to arrange some shows in Europe, but details of that are yet to be revealed. In mid-February 2016, the duo then released their next song from 55, titled \\"Best for Last\\", which features vocals from Walk the Moon. In just under a week after that song was released, the song \\"Love Me Like That\\", which features vocals from Carly Rae Jepsen, was made the next single from the album.

It can hold up to of water and is designed to provide Jordan with water for both human consumption and agriculture. Water from the reservoir is diverted through a diversion weir at Addassiyah downstream of the Al-Wehda dam to the King Abdullah Canal where it is mixed with other freshwater sources. Some of the water from the canal is then pumped to Amman to be used as drinking water, after being treated in the Zai water treatment plant. The discharge of effluents from adjacent agricultural lands has caused algae growth and eutrophication especially in spring.Seasonal variations in water quality of Al-Wehda Dam north of Jordan and water suitability for irrigation in summer, Arabian Journal of Geosciences-Springer, October 2011 Construction was funded by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (80%), the Abu Dhabi Development Fund (10%) and the Government of Jordan (10%). In February 2004 King Abdullah II of Jordan and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched the construction of the dam.

The agreement was renewed in 2001 when the design of the dam was modified, reducing it the storage capacity from 480 to 115 million cubic meters, and removing a hydropower plant that had initially been foreseen from the plans. According to a statement made by the Jordanian Minister of Water and Irrigation, Mousa Jamani, in April 2012 Syria violates the water sharing agreement, because Syrian farmers downstream of the dam use more than the 6 million cubic meters per year that they are entitled to for irrigation along the riverbank. The Minister also said that \\"since the agreement was signed, the number of Syrian dams increased from 26 to 48, while around 3,500 wells were drilled to pump water from the river basin\\", thus decreasing the amount of water flowing into the dam's reservoir. Until the 1960s, the Yarmouk River‚Äôs flow used to reach 16 cubic meters per second, but has since dropped to only one cubic meter per second.

DePalma (April 24, 1932Gregory J. DePalma at tributes.com \\\\- November 18, 2009, Butner, North Carolina) was a Caporegime in the Gambino crime family who was responsible for introducing an undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent in his crew. Celebrity life In the 1970s, DePalma became friends with numerous celebrities after he built the Westchester Premiere Theatre in Tarrytown, New York. These friends included singers Liza Minnelli and Dean Martin, and baseball player Willie Mays, with whom DePalma frequently played golf. However, DePalma's most prestigious friend was singer Frank Sinatra. In 1976, DePalma appeared in a famous group picture at the Theatre with Sinatra, then Gambino boss Carlo Gambino, future boss Paul Castellano, other Gambino mobsters, and L.A. acting mob boss Jimmy Fratianno. As soon as the theatre opened, DePalma and other mobsters started looting its cash and other assets. In 1977, DePalma became a made man in the Gambino crime family. On June 6, 1978, DePalma was indicted on state charges regarding the theatre's financial collapse. However, the first trial ended in a hung jury. Later in 1979, before the second trial, DePalma pleaded guilty bankruptcy fraud; one piece of evidence that helped the prosecution case was the picture with Sinatra.\\"Gregory DePalma Revisited - Part 1\\" Rick Pourelle's American Mafia.com August 12, 2002\\"Greg DiPalma, pal of Sinatra and Willie Mays, dies in prison\\" by Jerry Capeci The Huffington Post November 30, 2009 DePalma was sentenced to four years in prison. In the 1990s, DePalma was named a caporegime (captain). According to the FBI, he also visited imprisoned boss John Gotti while Gotti was incarcerated in 2001. Scores conviction In January 1999, both DePalma and son Craig pleaded guilty to racketeering charges.\\"Federal Prosecutors Request Two Trials of Younger Gotti\\" New York Times January 20, 1999 The charges were based on the Gambino takeover and extortion of Scores, a famous strip club in Manhattan. As with the Westchester Theatre, the Gambino plan was to drain the cash from Scores and then get out. On June 13, 1999, a federal judge sentenced DePalma to 70 months in federal prison, a light sentence due to DePalma's claims of poor health. The sentencing took place in DePalma's hospital room at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, New York. Later that day, the same judge sentenced Craig in court to 87 months in federal prison.\\"METRO NEWS BRIEFS: NEW YORK; Man and Son Sentenced As Part of Crime Family\\" New York Times June 13, 1999 In 2002, while still in prison, Craig attempted to hang himself and was left in a persistent vegetative state. He died in December 2010. Jack Falcone In 2003, a new mob associate, Jack Falcone (FBI special agent Joaquin Garcia), got close to DePalma. Over the next year, Falcone provided DePalma with a steady stream of excellent quality stolen goods. By August 2004, Garcia claims DePalma considered nominating him for induction into the Gambino family. DePalma did not realize that Falcone was actually Joaquin \\"Jack\\" Garcia, and the FBI was providing the goods. For two years, Garcia listened in (wearing a recording device) on conversations DePalma had with many mobsters in the Gambino family. On February 21, 2005, DePalma, Garcia, and Gambino mobster Robert Vaccaro were meeting another mobster, Peter \\"Petey Chops\\" Vicini in the Housewares section of a Bloomingdales department store in Westchester County. When Vicini failed to show them proper respect, Vaccaro grabbed a solid crystal candle holder and began beating him on the head. Garcia convinced DePalma to stop beating Vicini and leave Bloomingdale's quickly. Prison On March 9, 2005, Garcia's undercover assignment ended as FBI agents arrested DePalma and 32 other Gambino mobsters on racketeering charges. By May 2006, DePalma's health was again in decline. He had spent most of the past year in the hospital, had a cancerous lung removed, and had suffered a heart attack. DePalma was morbidly obese and taking 20 medications a day. However, the judge ruled that he was healthy enough to stand trial.

Resolution=Observations In the preamble of the resolution, the Security Council stressed that the lack of progress on a settlement between the two parties was unacceptable. It condemned the shooting down of an UNOMIG helicopter in October 2001 which resulted in nine deaths and deplored that the perpetrators of the attack had not been identified. The contributions of UNOMIG and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peacekeeping forces in the region were welcomed, in addition to the United Nations-led peace process. Acts The Security Council welcomed political efforts to resolve the situation, in particular the \\"Basic Principles for the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi\\" to facilitate negotiations between Georgia and Abkhazia. It regretted the lack of progress on political status negotiations and the refusal of Abkhazia to discuss the document, further calling on both sides to overcome their mutual mistrust. All violations of the 1994 Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces were condemned. The Council also welcomed the calm in the Kodori Valley and the signing of a protocol by both parties on 2 April 2002. Concerns of the civilian population were noted and the Georgian side was asked to guarantee the safety of UNOMIG and CIS troops in the valley. The resolution urged the two parties to revitalise the peace process, including greater participation on issues relating to refugees, internally displaced persons, economic co-operation and political and security matters. It also reaffirmed the unacceptability of demographic changes resulting from the conflict. Abkhazia in particular was called upon to improve law enforcement, address the lack of instruction to ethnic Georgians in their first language and ensure the safety of returning refugees. The police component of UNOMIG was in the process of being deployed, however there was concern that it had not deployed to the Gali region. The Council called again on both parties to take measures to identify those responsible for the shooting down of an UNOMIG helicopter in October 2001. Both parties were also asked to dissociate themselves from military rhetoric and demonstrations in support of illegal armed groups, and ensure the safety of United Nations personnel. Furthermore, there were concerns about the security of UNOMIG personnel, with repeated killings and abductions of UNOMIG and CIS peacekeeping personnel, which the Council condemned.

History Feuerzeig grew up in Hazlet, New Jersey and the Morganville section of Marlboro Township.Falkenstein, Michelle. \\"From Maplewood To Sundance\\", The New York Times, January 30, 2005. Accessed August 10, 2012. \\"In 1988, Daniel Johnston, a songwriter, gave a legendary concert in Pier Platters, an independent Hoboken record store. He had a mental breakdown during the concert and ran amok for two weeks, said Jeff Feuerzeig, who grew up in Hazlet and Morganville and attended Trenton State College.\\" He came of age just in time to receive the full impact of the punk rock wave and its attendant do-it-yourself aesthetic, an influence that dominates his approach and subject matter to the present. He graduated with honors from Trenton State College in 1986 and immediately enrolled in New York University's six-month Intensive Filmmaking Program, where he studied under Thierry Path√©. He has spent 25 years directing commercials for a wide assortment of corporate clients, including IBM, Delta Air Lines and Budweiser. In 1990, he directed Jon Hendricks: The Freddie Sessions, a profile of the famed jazz singer and member of Lambert, Hendricks & Ross. The half-hour film featured appearances by George Benson, Al Jarreau and Bobby McFerrin and was broadcast nationally on PBS. Half Japanese: The Band That Would Be King (1994) In 1993, marshaling his continuing interest in the outer limits of alternative music, Feuerzeig directed a 16mm feature documentary on brothers Jad and David Fair and their seminal proto-punk band Half Japanese, a passion project that was booked for an independent two-week run at Film Forum in New York and subsequently distributed by Tara Releasing in art-houses nationwide ‚Äì often in conjunction with the band playing full concerts after the screening. \\"Half Japanese has the feel of a complete put- on,‚Äù wrote Stephen Holden in The New York Times. The Devil and Daniel Johnston (2006) Over a five-year period beginning in 2000, Feuerzeig created an innovative and sympathetic portrait of West Virginia-born cult singer- songwriter and outsider artist Daniel Johnston, whose early-20s onset of manic-depression and schizophrenia enabled him to create a nakedly confessional body of work unfiltered by the limitations of his contemporaries. Working from the conceit of clinical psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison‚Äôs Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament (1993), and utilizing techniques from the New Journalism of the 1970s (the creation of first-person POV and internal monologue through audio cassette letters, journal entries, home movies, etc.), Feuerzeig documented the musician-artist‚Äôs struggles with his private demons ‚Äì many of them quite literal in his own mind ‚Äì elevating what might have been a footnote in rock history to world acclaim. New York Press film critic Matt Zoller Seitz said of Devil: ‚ÄúA true nonfiction film, a movie that tries to do with sound and image what journalists like Nick Tosches (Dino) and Norman Mailer (Armies of the Night) tried to do with prose, bending prose into poetry to find a more subjective route to truth.‚Äù The film appeared on many best of the decade lists. It was named by Mojo Magazine one of the 10 best music documentaries of all time and by Rolling Stone magazine one of the Top 25 music DVDs of all time. On the strength of the film, Feuerzeig spent a year working with Albert Maysles, where he created award-winning short-form documentaries for IBM. He is currently represented by Ridley Scott Associates (RSA) for commercial and television work. The Real Rocky (2011) On October 25, 2011, the ESPN network broadcast The Real Rocky, an original one-hour documentary directed by Feuerzeig as part of its ongoing documentary showcase series, original titled 30 for 30, and more recently re-branded as ‚ÄúESPN Films.‚Äù The film chronicles the ongoing controversy surrounding the true identity of the eponymous title character from the Sylvester Stallone Rocky franchise, which public opinion and folk wisdom has long held was based on New Jersey heavyweight boxer Chuck Wepner, ‚ÄúThe Bayonne Bleeder,‚Äù whose chief claim was that he once went 15 rounds with Muhammad Ali, even knocking him down in the ninth round (by, as it was later revealed, stepping on his foot). Using collage graphics somewhere between Roy Lichtenstein‚Äôs Pop Art confections and the ransom note typography of Jamie Reid's Sex Pistols album cover, the film spells out Rocky‚Äôs influence on Wepner‚Äôs personal life ‚Äì much of it catastrophic, such as his descent into cocaine and a brief stint in federal prison. To provide both insider insight and period detail, Feuerzeig assembles a round table of sportswriters and Jersey stalwarts reminiscent of the Carnegie Deli regulars in Woody Allen‚Äôs Broadway Danny Rose. According to Variety‚Äôs Brian Lowry, ‚Äú[F]or anyone familiar with boxing or even just the ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù franchise, ‚ÄúThe Real Rocky‚Äù ‚Äì shot partly in black and white to heighten its cinematic feel, and featuring boxing reporters as a sort of Greek chorus ‚Äì is the genuine article.‚Äù Other Projects In 2009, Feuerzeig began production on a proposed feature documentary about artist Shepard Fairey, the lawsuit brought against him by the Associated Press and his Fair Use defense in creating the iconic Barack Obama \\"Hope\\" poster during the 2008 presidential election. To be called The Boy Who Cried Hope, the film was postponed indefinitely following revelations that Fairey had lied about the photographic source material for the poster. In April 2011, Feuerzeig directed The Dude, an 18-minute documentary profile of Jeff ‚ÄúThe Dude‚Äù Dowd, a long-time producer‚Äôs rep for independent films and putative inspiration for the Coen Brothers‚Äô The Big Lebowski. The short was broadcast on the USA Network as part of its ‚ÄúCharacter‚Äù series. On 9 April 2013, called into The Best Show to discuss his \\"Piano Van\\" film project on the musician Chris Stroffolino. For his 2016 documentary Author: The JT LeRoy Story, Feuerzeig received a nomination for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay at the 69th Writers Guild of America Awards. Upcoming Projects Feuerzeig has completed the screenplay for God Bless Tiny Tim with filmmaker/playwright Julien Nitzberg. This portrait of the latterday crooner and accidental cultural icon is currently in development. He is also slated to direct The Bleeder, a biopic of boxer Chuck Wepner, whose life story inspired (and was in turn affected by) the Sylvester Stallone film Rocky. Feuerzeig co-wrote the script with Jerry Stahl, and the film is set to star Liev Schreiber as Wepner.Rosenberg, Adam; \\"EXCLUSIVE: Liev Schreiber Wants to Tell Real-Life 'Rocky' Story Next, Director Named\\" , Mtv.com, February 10, 2006 Filmography * Jon Hendricks: The Freddie Sessions (1990) * Half Japanese: The Band That Would Be King (1994) * The Devil and Daniel Johnston (2006) * The Dude (2011) * The Real Rocky (2011) * Author: The JT LeRoy Story (2016) * Chuck (2016) - Writer ReferencesExternal links * * Official film site * * IMDB film Category:American male screenwriters Category:People from Hazlet, New Jersey Category:People from Marlboro Township, New Jersey Category:Living people Category:1964 births Category:The College of New Jersey alumni Category:Tisch School of the Arts alumni Category:Film directors from New Jersey ","title":"Jeff Feuerzeig"},{"id":"29195041","text":"Red Bull Records is a global record label headquartered in Los Angeles, California.

Johann III, Count of Sponheim-Starkenburg, the Older (b. ca. 1315 ‚Äì d. 30 December 1398), reigned over the County of Sponheim for 67 years. He also received many epithets such as \\"the Noble\\" and, because of his declining vision, \\"the Blind\\".  Life and work  Johann III of Sponheim was the first son of Count Heinrich II of Sponheim and Loretta of Salm. He had two brothers, Heinrich and Gottfried. He succeeded his grandfather, John II, in 1324, but his mother Loretta acted as his regent until his coming of age in 1331. In 1331 he married Mechthild of the Electorate of the Palatinate, a niece of Ludwig der Bayer. During his reign, several important events occurred, such as the construction of the Heilig- Geist-Hospital in Enkirch and a war with the Archbishop of Trier, Boemund II of Saarbr√ºcken, which caused high death tolls on both sides. Johann III of Sponheim had, along with his mother, disputes with the Trier church. In 1338 he ceded Sponheim possessions as fiefdoms to Archbishop Baldwin of Luxembourg. G√ºnther, Wilhelm Arnold. Codex diplomaticus rheno-mosellanus: Urkunden- Sammlung zur Geschichte der Rhein- und Mosellande, der Nahe- und Ahrgegend, und des Hundsr√ºckens, des Meinfeldes und der Eifel. H. J. H√∂lscher, Koblenz 1824. Volume 3, Part 1. N. 240. Johann waged a feud against Archbishop Baldwin of Luxembourg, which was settled through atonement on 13 April 1347. On 4 January 1351 Archbishop Baldwin named Johann the chief Amtmann of the Trier lands on the right bank of the Moselle river. Immich-Spier, Hans. Anchiriacum - Enkirch 733 - 1983. Herausgegeben von der Gemeinde Enkirch, Enkirch 1983. In 1356, Baldwin's successor, Boemund, entered a conflict with Johann and his brother-in-law Rupert I, Elector Palatine, about the toll near Enkirch. This feud was troublesome for many Trier locations because of the associated robbery and fire, but Boemund destroyed Starkenburg, Kirchberg, and cornered Sponheim in such a way that Johann had to sue for peace in 1360. D√ºring, Reinhard. Zollturm an der Mosel (www.zollturm.de) The ensuing feud between Johann and his cousin Walram was not of great importance, since it was rapidly settled. On 9 May 1368, he bestowed the Sponheim Erbmarschall office, which had been vacated by the death of Simon of Waldeck, and the village of Sevenich associated with this fiefdom upon Lord Friedrich of Ehrenburg. For Winterburg, Koppenstein, and Birkenfeld, he received city rights from Kaiser Ludwig in 1330. He built a church in Trarbach, but the year is not known. He sent an abbot from Himmerod Abbey in Traben, who had to read the Mass in Trarbach daily, and three times a week in the absence of the Count. It is unknown whether he took part on the offensive organized by Count Kuno II of Falkenstein and Count Walram of Sponheim in 1362 against the Englishmen who were ravaging the left bank of the Rhine. Johann III was the builder of the Grevenburg (Grafenburg) over Trarbach, which was first mentioned on 3 October 1357. He was buried in the Abbey of Himmerod.  Family  In 1331, Johann III married Mechthild of the Palatinate (d. 1375). She was a daughter of the Count Palatine of the Rhine Rudolf I and Mechthild of Nassau. Paternally, she was great-granddaughter of King Rudolf of Habsburg, and maternally granddaughter of King Adolf of Nassau. Emperor Louis the Bavarian, who had reigned since 1314, was her uncle. With the extinction of both Sponheim lines in 1437, their two daughters Mechthild and Loretta posthumously inherited the whole County of Sponheim between the Baden and the Veldenz.

These control systems manage essential services including electricity, petroleum production, water, transportation, manufacturing, and communications. They rely on computers, networks, operating systems, applications, and programmable controllers, each of which could contain security vulnerabilities. The 2010 discovery of the Stuxnet worm demonstrated the vulnerability of these systems to cyber incidents. The United States and other governments have passed cyber-security regulations requiring enhanced protection for control systems operating critical infrastructure. Control system security is known by several other names such as SCADA security, PCN security, Industrial network security, Industrial control system (ICS) Cybersecurity, Operational Technology (OT) Security and Control System Cyber Security.  Risks  Insecurity of, or vulnerabilities inherent in industrial automation and control systems (IACS) can lead to severe consequences in categories such as safety, loss of life, personal injury, environmental impact, lost production, equipment damage, information theft, and company image. Guidance to assess, evaluate and mitigate these potential risks is provided through the application of many Governmental, regulatory, industry documents and Global Standards, addressed below.  Vulnerability of control systems  Industrial automation and control systems have become far more vulnerable to security incidents due to the following trends that have occurred over the last 10 to 15 years. * Heavy use of Commercial Off-the Shelf Technology (COTS) and protocols. Integration of technology such as MS Windows, SQL, and Ethernet means that process control systems are now vulnerable to the same viruses, worms and trojans that affect IT systems * Enterprise integration (using plant, corporate and even public networks) means that process control systems (legacy) are now being subjected to stresses they were not designed for * Demand for Remote Access - 24/7 access for engineering, operations or technical support means more insecure or rogue connections to control system * Security Through Obscurity - Using not publicly available protocols or standards is detrimental to system security The cyber threats and attack strategies on automation systems are changing rapidly. Fortunately, regulation of control system security is rare as regulation is a slow moving process. The United States, for example, only does so for the nuclear power and the chemical industries.  Government efforts  The U.S. Government Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) originally instituted a control systems security program (CSSP) now the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) Industrial Control Systems, which has made available a large set of free National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards documents regarding control system security.  Industrial Automation & Control System (IACS) Cybersecurity Standards =ISA/IEC-62443 (Formerly ISA-99) ISA/IEC-62443 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that define procedures for implementing electronically secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). This guidance applies to end-users (i.e. asset owner), system integrators, security practitioners, and control systems manufacturers responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing, or managing industrial automation and control systems. These documents were originally referred to as ANSI/ISA-99 or ISA99 standards, as they were created by the International Society for Automation (ISA) 99 committee, accredited by and publicly released as American National Standards Institute (ANSI) documents. In 2010, they were renumbered to be the ANSI/ISA-62443 series. This change was intended to align the ISA and ANSI document numbering with the corresponding International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards. All ISA work products are now numbered using the convention ‚ÄúISA-62443-x-y‚Äù and previous ISA99 nomenclature is maintained for continuity purposes only. ISA99 remains the name of the Industrial Automation and Control System Security Committee of the ISA. Since 2002, the committee has been developing a multi-part series of standards and technical reports on the subject of IACS security. These work products are then submitted to the ISA approval and then publishing under ANSI. They are also submitted to IEC for consideration as standards and specifications in the IEC 62443 series following the IEC standards development process. Planned and published ISA62443 work products for IACS Security. All ISA-62443 standards and technical reports are organized into four general categories called General, Policies and Procedures, System and Component.More information about the activities and plans of the ISA99 committee is available on the committee Wiki site () # The first (top) category includes common or foundational information such as concepts, models and terminology. Also included are work products that describe security metrics and security life cycles for IACS. # The second category of work products targets the Asset Owner. These address various aspects of creating and maintaining an effective IACS security program. # The third category includes work products that describe system design guidance and requirements for the secure integration of control systems. Core in this is the zone and conduit design model. # The fourth category includes work products that describe the specific product development and technical requirements of control system products. This is primarily intended for control product vendors, but can be used by integrator and asset owners for to assist in the procurement of secure products.  IEC-62443  The IEC-62443 cybersecurity standards are the result of the IEC standards creation process where ANSI/ISA-62443 proposals are submitted to country committees where review is done and comments regarding changes are submitted. The comments are reviewed by various IEC 62443 committees where comments are discussed and changes are made as agreed upon. Many members of the IEC committees are the same persons from the ISA S99 committees. To date, the fundamental concepts from the original ANSI/ISA 62443 documents have been utilized. These standards are being used by practitioners in several industries to design and evaluate automation systems for cybersecurity resilience. Several of the standards are being used in personnel, engineering process, product, and system cybersecurity certification programs (also called conformity assessment programs). Certifications are awarded by accredited Certification Bodies (CB) who operate following ISO/IEC 17065 and ISO/IEC 17025. Certification Bodies are accredited to perform the auditing, assessment, and testing work by an Accreditation Body (AB). There is often one national AB in each country. These ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies. ABs are typically members of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs.  Control system security certification = The ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI) IEC 62443 Conformity Assessment Program  ISCI created the first conformity assessment scheme (commonly known as a certification scheme) for the ISA S99 IACS cybersecurity standards. This program certifies Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) IACS products and systems, addressing securing the IACS supply chain. exida from the United States was the first organization accredited for the ISCI scheme by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) followed by the Control Systems Security Center ‚Äì Certification Laboratory (CSSC-CL) accredited by the Japan Accreditation Board (JAB) and T√úV Rheinland accredited by Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle (DAkkS). All of these AB organizations are members of the IAF. = ISASecure IEC 62443 Certification Offerings= Two COTS product certifications are available under the ISASecure¬Æ brand: ISASecure-CSA (Component Security Assurance) certifying automation products to the 62443-4-1 / 62443-4-2 IACS cybersecurity standards and ISASecure-SSA (System Security Assurance), certifying IACS systems to the IEC 62443-3-3 standard. A third certification, SDLA (Secure Development Lifecycle Assurance) is available from ISCI which certifies IACS development organizations to the 62443-4-1 cybersecurity standard, providing assurances that a supplier organization has institutionalized cybersecurity into their product development practices. =ISO 17065 and Global Accreditation= The ISASecure 62443 conformity assessment scheme is an ISO 17065 program whose labs (certification bodies or CB) are independently accredited by ANSI/ANAB, JAB and other global ISO 17011 accreditation bodies (AB). The certification labs must also meet ISO 17025 lab accreditation requirements to ensure consistent application of certification requirements and recognized tools. Through Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRA) with IAF, ILAC and others, the accreditation of the ISASecure labs by the ISA 17011 accreditation bodies ensures that certificates issued by any of the ISASecure labs are globally recognized. =Test Tool Recognition= The ISASecure scheme includes a process for recognizing test tools to ensure the tools meet functional requirements necessary and sufficient to execute all required product tests and that test results will be consistent among the recognized tools. =Traditional Process industries including Chemicals, Oil and Gas= ISCI development processes include maintenance policies to ensure that the ISASecure certifications remain in alignment with the IEC 62443 standards as they evolve. While the IEC 62443 standards are designed to horizontally address technical cybersecurity requirements of a cross-section of industries, the ISASecure scheme‚Äôs certification requirements working groups include subject matter experts from the chemical and oil and gas industries and are reflective of their cybersecurity needs.  Building Management Systems  ISCI published a 2017 study which confirmed applicability of the IEC 62443 standards and ISASecure certification to Building Management Systems. The resulting study, executive summary, and PPT are available for free download from the www.isasecure.org website. ISCI has added leading BMS suppliers to its membership and established a BMS working group to support ongoing expansion of ISASecure certifications for BMS.  IEC 62443 Certification Programs IEC 62443 certification schemes have also been established by several global Certification Bodies. Each has defined their own scheme based upon the referenced standards and procedures. Programs are being offered globally by several recognized CBs including exida, T√úV Rheinland, T√úV Sud, T√úV Nord, and SGS-T√úV Saar.

Its premise is that witchcraft flourishes as an open secret among women. The story is told from the point of view of a small-town college professor who discovers that his wife is a witch. This novel was the first by Fritz Leiber and was first published in the April 1943 edition of Unknown. It is said to have been the inspiration for at least three films:Old Masters of Horror: Fritz Leiber Weird Woman (1944), Night of the Eagle (also known as Burn, Witch, Burn!) (1962), and Witches' Brew (also known as Which Witch is Which?) (1980). In 2019, the novel was awarded the \\"Retro\\" Hugo Award for Best Novel. Plot Tansy Saylor is the wife of an up-and-coming young sociology professor at a small, conservative American college. She is also a witch. Her husband, Norman, discovers this one day while rummaging through her dressing table: he finds vials of graveyard dirt, packets of hair and fingernail clippings from their acquaintances, and other evidence of her witchcraft. He confronts Tansy, and manages to convince her that her faith in magic is a result of superstition and neurosis. Tansy burns her charms; and Norman's luck immediately goes sour. He realizes that he had been protected, up till now, by Tansy's charms, and that as a result of his meddling, they are both now powerless to counteract the spells and charms of the other witches all around them. Critical response The novel is widely acknowledged to be a classic of modern horror fiction. It was included in David Pringle's Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels and in Fantasy: The 100 Best Books by James Cawthorn and Michael Moorcock. In The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, David Langford described it as \\"an effective exercise in the paranoid.\\"John Clute and John Grant, eds., The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, St Martin's Press, 1999, p.574 Damon Knight wrote Anthony Boucher and McComas similarly lauded the novel as \\"one of the best of all novels on witchcraft survivals in the enlightened modern world.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, January 1953, p.91 P.

The Time Out Film Guide describes it as \\"an unassuming but occasionally effective second-feature thriller.\\"Time Out Film Guide, Penguin Books London, 1989, p.62 Plot Paul Gregory (Sylvester) is a blind but very successful pop music composer, married to the beautiful Anne (Shelley). Anne is having a secret affair with struggling artist Rickie Seldon (Alexander Davion), and persuades Paul to commission Rickie to paint her portrait as a pretext to enable them to spend time together. Paul agrees, but after a recording session with Ronnie Carroll he is told by his business partner Mike Williams (Mark Eden) that Anne and Rickie have been seen about town together in circumstances which leave no doubt that they are more than friends. Paul knows that Mike has always disliked Anne and suspects he may be trouble-causing, but is finally persuaded of the validity of his allegations. Paul makes it clear to Anne that he has found out about the affair and threatens to leave her. Fearing her meal-ticket is about to disappear, she tells Rickie that they will have to arrange an \\"accident\\" to Paul by getting him drunk and pushing him off the balcony of their home. If Rickie does not agree, she suggests, their affair must end. The plan is attempted, but is botched by Rickie, whose heart is not really in it. After a struggle, he and Paul start to talk and Paul tells him to open his eyes to Anne's true nature, suggesting that she may well be double-crossing him too. Rickie, having no personal antipathy towards Paul, comes to the conclusion that he may be right. The pair end up forming an unlikely alliance, unknown to Anne, to try to entrap her into revealing her true motives. Between them they manage to set her up, and discover that the serious romance is between Anne and Mike, who have managed to hide it for so long by the public pretence of mutual antagonism and loathing. In fact the whole scheme had been concocted with Rickie in mind as a convenient fall guy, there to take the rap if suspicions were aroused about Paul's death.

Six years after the commission was formed, Giani accepted the responsibility of serving as the Commission's Counsel. He joined the Commission in 1998, after the previous Counsel had resigned. Giani worked on the final report which was handed over to the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Home Minister P. Chidambaram by Justice Liberhan and Giani a further 11 years later, on 30 June 2009. Giani remained the Commission's Counsel for over a year and a half, till the Commission was wound up with the submission of the report. In the parliamentary debate in the lower house of the Indian Parliament, Members of Parliament Pinaki Mishra and Sushma Swaraj stated that they believed that the report had in fact been written by Giani rather than Chief Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan.

The film starred British TV actress Mary Woodvine, and was filmed in 18 days in Cornwall, England on a budget of ¬£12,000. It premiered in The UK at the Cambridge Film Festivalhttp://moorethanthis.wordpress.com/2008/09/22/cambridge-film-festival- review-the-lark/ and has subsequently been shown at The Calgary International Film Festival, The Twin Rivers Media Festival where picked up the 1st Place prize for Best Featurehttp://www.twinriversmediafestival.com/friopen.pdf and at the 1st LIC Astoria Film Festival.http://www.astorialicff.com/view.php?id=25 Plot The film opens with the a woman, Niamh (Mary Woodvine), dragging a body in from the cold, white out-side into what looks like a disused run-down factory who's walls are covered in strange, cryptical maps that seem to not make any sense. She is wearing a blue boiler suit and a respirator. The body \\"Sean\\" (Ian Marshall) is also dressed in a blue boiler suit and appears badly wounded (from one of the traps). Niamh calls out for \\"Doc\\" and \\"Friday\\" although nobody appears. Sean and Niamh appear to know each other but as they exchange words two children appear asking what is going on. Niamh tells them that Sean has been out-side without his respirator and is very ill. She tells the children to go back to their room and wait for her. Sean quips that he is fine and asks if they want some sweeties. The children disappear. Sean repeats that he is 'fine' over and over again then tells her he can smell bread, she agrees she can then continues to drag him through the endless corridors. Later, Niamh is frantically cleaning the trail of blood on the floor. Rory and Roison, her children, appear and ask if they can help look for respirators. Later they are in their room where Niamh tells them that Sean has left them some sweeties. After reading them a bedtime story she sings them to sleep. Niamh starts talking to her friend Doc (Phil Jacobs), they talk about Sean and she asks him to re-set the traps. She doesn't acknowledge that he is not dressed in a boiler suit and he seems matter-of-fact about the situation, but Niamh is tense. As she goes to search for more respirators she starts imagining strange images and noises. We see an old style film recording of Niamh in normal clothes having a picnic. It abruptly cuts back to Niamh presently. A while later she hears a noise coming from the main door. Doc notes that he thought Niamh had set the traps. As Niamh turns to respond Doc has vanished. She goes to investigate. Two people are now inside the building also wearing boiler suits and carrying torches. Niamh follows them and eventually corners them in a small room demanding to know how they have been walking outside without respirators and what they are doing here. The man \\"Jackson\\" (Mark Pearce) and the woman \\"Siobhan\\" (Helen Rule) claim they are looking for Sean. Niamh stops interrogating them and asks them to follow her. They seem bewildered at Niamh's obsession with the strangely marked maps on the wall and eventually they end up in another room where Niamh informs Jackson that he will be sleeping there. He doesn't seem keen on being split up from Siobhan and Niamh asks her if they sleep together. Siobhan laughs at this and says the fact Jackson will be in the small room on his own serves as 'poetic justice'. Niamh seems puzzled at this comment but does not ask any questions. Siobhan remarks to Jackson that Niamh knows her name. She then leads Siobhan on another journey to her room where Siobhan tenderly asks Niamh how she can sleep in a place like this. Niamh rejects Siobhan's kindness and leaves her alone in the room. Later on Niamh catches Jackson and Siobhan looking for respirators, Siobhan shows Niamh some sweets she had found claiming they know they belong to Sean. Niamh takes to some of her maps and asks them to make all the maps 'right'. She tells them they either do it or go. Niamh continues to have strange visions and dreams and when Doc appears he tells them it could be handy having Jackson and Siobhan there as they hold the 'secrets' she needs for her survival. She goes to see Jackson and Siobhan in Jackson's room armed with alcohol and food and claims it's time for a celebration. Jackson gets mad but Siobhan tries to calm him down. They end up getting drunk. Siobhan recognises a song that Niamh sings (A variant of A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me) and tells Niamh that her father taught it to her, Niamh claims she can't remember where she heard it. Siobhan goes back to her room and leaves the remaining two on their own. Niamh asks Jackson why the tense atmosphere and after a confrontation Niamh storm out. She goes to her sleeping children and carries them away as she is now getting concerned about Siobhan and Jackson's presence. She begs Doc for help and they carry the children to the main door. Doc hands Rory back to Niamh who crumples to the floor, she cries out to Doc who simply appears to vanish. Niamh is left sobbing with her children unable to escape her 'prison'. Angry, she goes to see Jackson desperately begging for the secrets. She asks if he's married, he replies he once was and shows her pictures of his children but she refuses to look at them and runs off. They soon begin to realise that Siobhan is missing and when they find blood in her room Niamh accuses Jackson of murdering her. He denies it and shows Niamh papers he says are the secrets that Niamh has been searching for. Niamh runs away from him and he pursues her. She realises her children are no longer there either. She tries to run from Jackson leading him around the maze of corridors and rooms. Her voice echos around the building as Jackson pursues her in desperation as he catches up with her he falls to his death through a hole in the floor Niamh had stumbled across before when she was looking for respirators. We discover in flashbacks that Niamh was suffering depression and had drugged her children and then tried to drug herself unsuccessfully, her children dying as a result. Jackson was her husband, Siobhan was her sister and Sean was her Father. All other characters were figments of her imagination. This sudden realisation brings her back down to earth as the police break into the building, which is a dis-used mental asylum she was once a patient at. She is taken away by police, having now murdered the rest of her family.

Developed by Incinerator Studios, it was published in May, 2011 by Atari SA. It is a re-imagining of 1979's Star Raiders which was the killer app for Atari, Inc.'s then-new Atari 8-bit family of home computers. The original was well-received for expanding the space combat simulation genre with higher quality graphics and more complex gameplay. It inspired key games over a decade later such as Wing Commander and Star Wars: X-Wing. Like the original, Star Raiders is an action, first-person spaceship combat game in which the player travels through a starfield in pursuit of the game's enemy, the \\"Zylons\\". The 2011 game adds a new storyline, customizable ships, and multiplayer gameplay with several modes.  Gameplay  Screenshot of Star Raiders gameplay Star Raiders features a storyline very similar to that of the 1979 classic. The Zylons, an alien race bent on humanity‚Äôs destruction, are moving their forces towards earth, and it is up to player to repel their assault and save the human race. The player‚Äôs ship is a small space fighter, but with the capability to transform itself to deal with a variety of situations. The forms include a dogfighting ship, capable of close and quick battles with other Zylon dogfighters, an assault form that is good at destroying larger, more powerful enemy ships, and a turret form, for destroying the largest Zylon ships from the inside. All of these forms will be needed, as the Zylon‚Äôs dramatically outnumber the player, both in numbers and size of their ships. Aside from fighters of similar size, the Zylons have cruisers and frigates to confront the player, as well as their largest ship, the Basestar. Players can defeat the other 3 types of ships with conventional weaponry, but have to travel inside the Basestar and destroy certain key points to finally eliminate it. The gameplay unfolds along a galactic map, as players choose which missions they want to undertake to defeat the Zylon threat. Missions involve the players dogfighting with Zylon forces in a variety of settings, from an asteroid field to gigantic space elevators, and end when all the Zylon ships are eliminated. Once the mission is completed, players can return to the area if they so choose, to find ore for upgrading their weapons and shields.  Reception  The game received generally poor reviews. Metacritic gave the game a score of 35 out of 100. Some comments about the game included \\"Star Raiders gets boring way too quickly and fails to motivate you to play on.\\" by GamingXP and \\"A mediocre, boring space shooter. Some ideas are interesting, but clunky controls and uninspired visuals makes this title a complete waste.\\" by Multiplayer.it. A summary of the main points of the review from GameSpot states that the game has \\"woefully inadequate tutorials, dull dogfights, bland visuals and annoying sound effects\\". Also one of the main actions in the game, which is destroying capital ships, is painfully tedious.

The plot centers around teenager Michael Perrin's search for what is a Song of Power and why some think he can create such a thing. Transported to another realm, he discovers beings known as \\"the \\"Sidhe\\" intervened in Coleridge's incomplete poem, \\"Kubla Khan\\". They have stopped others from creating Songs of Power and now they are looking at him.Bear, Greg; The Infinity Concerto; Legend; New York: 1988. 342p. The Infinity Concerto was followed in 1986 by The Serpent Mage. Synopsis In 1939, a composer named Arno Waltiri premiered his latest work, Concerto Opus 45: \\"Infinity\\". After the concert, another composer, who had been in the audience, filed a lawsuit against Waltiri, claiming that he was no longer able to properly hear or compose music after hearing Waltiri's work. Over the next several months, dozens of people simply disappeared, and the only thing they had in common with one another was that they had been in the audience at that same performance. Waltiri had been inspired to write the concerto by several conversations with a mysterious man named David Clarkham. The Concerto turns out to have been a \\"Song of Power\\", Songs of Power, if properly applied by those who understand them, have the power to literally remake the world. Songs of Power can exist in many artistic forms, including music, poetry, dance, art, architecture, and some less obvious creative fields. Clarkham had disappeared after the performance too, but he had left Waltiri a book and the key to his house, which Waltiri had never used. The book's present story follows the experiences of a young man named Michael Perrin, a would be poet, who meets Waltiri two months before his death, and to whom Waltiri gives the book and the key. Following the instructions on a piece of paper he found inserted in the book, Perrin enters Clarkham's house, which has been vacant for decades, and soon finds himself in Sidhedark, a world inhabited by a powerful race of beings calling themselves the Sidhe (pronounced \\"shee\\"). He appears at what he learns is the house of someone called the \\"Isomage\\", who disappeared years ago, and meets a huge, strange woman named Lamia, who lives there. Michael is already in danger, because by treaty there is only one town where humans are safe from being hunted and killed by the Sidhe: Euterpe, where Lamia hastily sends Michael before anyone finds him. Humans occasionally find their way to Sidhedark, and those who have survived all live in Euterpe, a town in the Pact Lands, which is the only place humans are permitted in Sidhedark, following an ancient war between Sidhe and the powerful ancient Humans. There Michael is befriended by a former teacher, Savarin. He returns to the Isomage's house to talk to Lamia, asking her how he can get home, and she said that he will need training in order to make his way back to Earth. She orders him to go see the Crane Women, who are a trio of \\"Breeds\\" (part human, part Sidhe), who live on the outskirts of another town populated by other Breeds called Halftown. They train him with exercises that seem pointless and incomprehensible. During his training he returns periodically to Euterpe, telling Savarin about things that he has seen and learned. One night a number of creatures called Riverines and Umbrals raid Halftown and kidnap three of the Breeds who lived there, taking them to serve Adonna, a sort of god of the Sidhe, by bleeding them of magic. They attack Michael, but he survives and makes his way back to the Crane Women. They tell him that he did something they call \\"out-seeing\\" to escape the Umbrals, throwing a \\"shadow\\" of himself as an illusion that deceived them long enough for him to escape. The Crane Women take him with them on a journey across a desolate area known as \\"the Blasted Plain\\", which surrounds the Pact Lands. In the main part of the Sidhe world, where he meets Biri, a young Sidhe who has been sent to the Crane Women for training. He and Michael share some knowledge about each other's worlds. Meanwhile, Michael reads Clarkham's book that Waltiri gave to him, which is a book of poetry, and tries to write some of his own in the dirt. Sometimes, though, it seems as if he is writing words that aren't his own; he likens this experience to being \\"tuned into Death's Radio\\", giving a name to this strange contact, which comes and goes. Michael finds himself attracted to Helena, a human woman who, prior to his arrival, was the most recent arrival from Earth. He learns that it is dangerous for humans to have sex in Sidhedark, however, because if the woman conceives, she will give birth to a monster. He also learns that the humans of Euterpe are working on a plan to rebel and escape from the Pact Lands into the rest of Sidhedark, where they hope to find a place to live free of Sidhe control. Meanwhile, a Breed woman named Eleuth is attracted to Michael, and it doesn't bother her that he is in love with Helena, because Sidhe men apparently don't fall in love, although the women do. One night Eleuth tries to send Michael home to Earth, believing that she has learned enough magic to do so, but only manages to send him as far as the gateway within the Isomage's house. Michael no longer has the key, though, and cannot unlock the gate, and Lamia's monstrous sister nearly captures him, but Eleuth sacrifices her life to save him. At the same time, the humans in Euterpe stage their rebellion, and the Sidhe retaliate violently, especially a rider named Alyons. Michael rushes to try to help them, but ends up being pursued by Alyons into a dead-end canyon, where one of the Isomage's leftover magical traps goes off and kills Alyons, allowing Michael to escape. Now that he has killed a Sidhe, the Crane Women know that they will not stop until they catch him, so they give him what they can, which is unfortunately only advice, and he crosses the Blasted Plane on foot, evading the monsters there only by means of using the training the Crane Women gave him. After he crosses, a shadow of Alyons comes to him and tells Michael that since Michael killed him, he must now accept Alyons' horse. Michael argues that he didn't kill Alyons; a trap set by the Isomage did, but it is to no avail; as a matter of honor he must accept the horse. So he does, and the horse makes his travel quicker. He comes to a golden valley where there is a beautiful palace, inhabited by a man named Lin Piao Tai. It turns out that he is a Spryggla, neither human nor Sidhe, one of the few remaining of the many races that existed long ago, before the Human Sidhe war. The Spryggla were skilled architects. Lin Piao tells Michael a lot about the past, and how Humans were losing the war, until the Isomage was able to put up a final resistance which the Sidhe were unable to break, and thus fight them to an standstill and an uneasy, millennia-long truce. Lin Piao is very excited that he has a book containing the poem \\"Kubla Khan\\", because it is the first part of a Song of Power, and the Isomage had him build another part of the same Song architecturally. The valley that Lin Piao Tai lives in is also his prison, however, and Michael begins to suspect that he won't let him leave either. The Sidhe have crippled Lin Piao Tai's magic with a weakness: the color blue is his undoing, and a blue flower that Michael had earlier pressed into the book falls out from between the pages, setting off a magical chain reaction that destroys the Spryggla's creations and turns him to stone. Michael travels onward and meets a human man named Nikolai, who has been living in a forest as a hunter. He was originally a dancer, and was pulled into the Sidhe world just as the Isomage's war was ending. He is welcome in the Sidhe city of Inyas Trai, however, and he takes Michael there. Michael meets the Ban of Hours, a powerful Sidhe woman who tries to protect him, but not far from the city is the Irall, the Temple of Adonna, which would certainly punish Michael for Alyons' death if they caught him. Nikolai takes Michael to see a rare phenomenon known as the Snow Faces that occurs in the nearby mountains, where he meets some other pilgrims who have also come to see it. As they are returning to Inyas Trai, some of Adona's Sidhe followers known as \\"the Black Order\\" arrive to arrest Michael and take him to the Irall. Michael is brought before the god Adonna itself, who reveals itself to be Tonn, ancient Mage of the Sidhe, though most have forgotten this and now simply worship him as the god Adonna. Tonn reveals that he is growing tired and Sidhedark, which he created, will soon crumble and die, along with all within it. The only way to save the Sidhe is for Sidhedark and Earth to be reunited, but for the followers of Adonna, who hate humans, this is a blasphemy that they would never accept, even if Adonna itself told them. So Tonn needs Michael's help, but first he must deal with the Isomage, who has been manipulating Michael from the beginning. Tonn temporarily erases most of Michael's memory of the conversation and sends him back. Michael, Nikolai and some of the pilgrims decide to go to the Isomage's palace, but on the way, Michael meets Biri again. He says that he has failed in his training to become part of the Maln, the Black Order, and now despises them. He attempts to teach Michael more about how Sidhe do magic, taking a bitter, solipsistic approach, claiming that to do magic one must emotionally isolate oneself from all love and companionship. Biri leaves Michael to contemplate this. As the group approaches the Isomage's residence, the pilgrims reveal that they are actually retainers in the Isomage's employ, and that they are there to make sure that Michael gets there safely‚Äîand that he doesn't change his mind and go elsewhere. Reaching the palace, Michael finds that it is as Lin Piao Tai said: a beautifully-constructed copy of Kubla Khan's palace from the poem. Michael meets the Isomage, who turns out to be David Clarkham, and tells him that Tonn stole the book from him, but Clarkham doesn't care, he has many copies of the poem along with other works of human literature. Biri is also there; he says that the Isomage represents his best chance for revenge against the Maln. Clarkham finally reveals what he wants Michael there for: Michael is a poet, and Clarkham is not. He wants Michael to finish the Song of Power. Michael, however, suspects that while Clarkham seems to want to help humans, he really just wants power for himself‚Äîhe wants to overthrow the Sidhe and set himself up as ruler instead. After discovering some other very unsavory things about Clarkham, he is unwilling to help him obtain ultimate power, but Clarkham threatens Michael with the death of Nikolai and with horrible magical torture for Michael himself if he doesn't cooperate. But suddenly Michael sees the form of the rest of the Song of Power and realizes that it isn't at all what Clarkham thinks it is. Michael writes a poem about the destruction of the great Khan's palace, the inevitable ending of the Song, and Clarkham's palace starts to collapse around them. As it is taking all his power to hold the palace together, Clarkham can't stop Michael and Nikolai from escaping, and Biri reveals that he did not in fact fail in his training and that he has been working for the Maln all along, helping Michael get to the Isomage to destroy him. Clarkham manages to attack Michael magically, but Michael throws a shadow consisting of all of the training that Biri had given him, which absorbs the attack and dies in his place. Now that Michael had done what Tonn wanted, Tonn gives Michael what he wants: passage back home. Michael falls through the portal that Tonn creates and finds himself just down the street from Clarkham's house, but five years have passed on Earth in what had seemed like only about five months to Michael. His parents are happy that he is alive but upset that he hadn't told them where he'd gone, and they are astonished about how much he has changed. Michael finds a letter from Arno Waltiri's wife Golda, who had died about two weeks after her husband, leaving all of their assets to him but also giving him the responsibility of editing and publishing all of Waltiri's compositions. But meanwhile, Michael knows that Sidhedark is still collapsing and that the being who was Waltiri is most certainly not dead. He may be home, but his troubles are far from over. Settings The book begins and ends in the human world, in the present day (in the 1980s, when the book was published, in southern California), but most of the story takes place in the alternate world of Sidhedark. Sidhedark Sidhedark is another plane, world, or dimension, another place where the physical laws are different from what we know. Humans don't need to sleep there (though many do, just out of habit), and when they do, they don't dream. =Metaphysics= Unlike the book's version of Earth, in which humans are unequivocally stated to have souls that live on after death, in Sidhedark humans who die simply cease to exist. Likewise, it is quite bad for humans to give birth to children there, because there are no souls to enter their bodies, so horrible abominations take up residence in them instead. The god Adonna, who created Sidhedark, seems not to have given its world quite as much permanence as the human world has. It is possible for beings with enough knowledge and willpower to cause temporary changes. Some call this \\"magic\\", but it is really just a consequence of Adonna's creation not being as stable as some worlds are. =Geography= No map appears in the book, but it does describe locations: a small corner of Sidhedark is known as the Pact Lands, containing the human town of Euterpe and the Breed town of Halftown, as well as the Isomage's house. The Pact Lands are separated from the rest of Sidhedark by the Blasted Plain. The Blasted Plain itself is a desertlike landscape punctuated by poisonous pools of viscous liquids. In it dwell a number of Adonna's abortions‚Äîfailed creations that live out their twisted existences in pain or madness; they were originally buried beneath the ground, but the magical war that created the Plain freed them. To cross the Plain requires either some form of talisman to repel the abortions or a Sidhe horse, fast enough to outrun them and wise enough to sense and avoid them. The rest of the Realm contains areas such as: * Konhem, \\"the deepest, darkest forest in the Realm\\" * Nebchat Lem, \\"a lake, almost a sea, very deep\\" * Chebal Malen, the Black Mountains * The Sklassa, the fortress of the Black Order * The Irall, the temple of Adonna * The city of Inyas Trai * Heba Mish, the mountain where the Snow Faces appear =History= Tens of millions of years ago, there was but one world inhabited by 30 races, including the humans, the Sidhe, the Cledar, the Spryggla, and the Urges. Over time, four great leaders arose, calling themselves the Mages: Manus of the humans (sometimes called the Serpent Mage), Tonn of the Sidhe, Aum of the Cledar, and Daedal of the Spryggla. There were many lesser mages, however, and they quarreled with each other, these quarrels turning into conflicts and wars. In a world of magic, though, death wasn't forever; wounds could be magically healed and souls resurrected. At one point the humans defeated the Sidhe, and Manus, the Serpent Mage of the humans, used his magic to take away the Sidhe's souls. Every other race lived on metaphysically after the death of their bodies, but the Sidhe would no longer do so. However, in the end the Sidhe won, and Tonn, the Mage of the Sidhe, took vengeance upon each of the other races by transforming them into animals: the humans became tiny shrews (apparently their original form was somewhat dragonlike), the Cledar became birds, the Spryggla became whales and dolphins, and the Urges became roaches. Only the humans have recovered from this to any extent, evolving into primates and developing a civilization, and it has taken them tens of millions of years. The Sidhe then moved to a world that Tonn created for them. Tonn's daughter Elme fell in love with a human named Akse, bearing many children with him, the first Breeds, but most Sidhe hated humans for what they had done to the Sidhe. During the development of human civilization, Tonn tried to keep the humans from rediscovering magic and acquiring a Song of Power, pretending to be various gods including Yahweh and Baal, discouraging creativity and change. Elme, however, formed the Council of Eleu to try to help the humans improve and become a race the Sidhe could accept as equals. Tonn's wife sided with their daughter, but in a fit of anger he transformed her into a monster. The conflict between the two factions continued. Then, decades ago, there was a war between the Sidhe and a powerful Breed sorcerer known as the Isomage, burning a large portion of Sidhedark and creating an area now known as the Blasted Plain; the upheavals also released some of Adonna's unwanted creations that it had hidden underground. Occasionally humans accidentally find their way into Sidhedark and, unable to leave, must make the best of things. Some survive, others don't, and those who do end up in the town of Euterpe, near the Isomage's old house. The war ended in a ceasefire, but the Isomage still had enough power to force a treaty with the Sidhe; he seems to have been on the humans' side and made them agree to allow the humans to live in peace, with the condition that the Isomage go into exile. The Sidhe The Sidhe are a varied people, consisting of many different types: * The Faer are the most numerous. They are humanoid with long, narrow faces and slender limbs. They often have red or reddish blond hair. They can interbreed with humans, and the offspring of such a union are called Halfbreeds, or just Breeds. * Arborals live in forests. They are humanoid, but with green or brownish-green complexions. They control the use and distribution of all wood in the Realm. The Arborals are also responsible for preserving the memories and consciousness of dead Sidhe by pressing them into trees. * Meteorals are Sidhe of the air. They are colorless and translucent, insubstantial in appearance like spirits, but not immaterial. * Riverines live in rivers and streams. Like meteorals, their forms are colorless and translucent. They are some of Adonna's most devout worshippers. * Umbrals live in shadows and avoid sunlight. Their faces are utterly black with bright star-like eyes, and they are cold to the touch. They are also some of Adonna's most devout worshippers. * Pelagals live in the oceans. * Amorphals live in caverns and can take many forms. Characters=Michael Perrin Perrin is a teenager, 16 years old, still living with his parents, who seem to be fairly well-off; his father is a carpenter with a clientele that includes several wealthy and famous people. Michael tries to write poetry, but even he considers his efforts unimpressive; what he writes he himself barely understands. He is a fan of classic films and their scores. But he has hidden depths that even he doesn't know of. When a mysterious key and book fall on his lap, he follows up on it out of curiosity but ends up persevering through trials beyond anything he could have imagined. Arno Waltiri Waltiri is a composer who has written the scores for several classic films over the years but also wrote his own music. In 1939, after several conversations with the mysterious David Clarkham, Waltiri wrote a concerto, titled Opus 45: \\"Infinity\\", that had a strange effect on everyone who heard its first and only performance. When Michael Perrin meets him, Waltiri is an old man; he dies two weeks later. We later discover that Waltiri was in fact never human; he was in reality Aum, the Mage of the Cledar, and not even Clarkham knew this at the time. David Clarkham/\\"The Isomage\\" Born on Earth in 1499 to a Sidhe mother and a human father, Clarkham is thus a Breed. In the book's backstory he came to work for the Maln, attempting to prevent humans from discovering Songs of Power. He is the \\"person from Porlock\\" who interrupts poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge as he is writing his poem \\"Kubla Khan\\", which will otherwise become such a Song. However, he begins to disagree with the Maln's policy and finally rebels, attempting instead to help humans. Over time he becomes a powerful sorcerer, but calls himself the \\"Isomage\\", not wanting to be so arrogant as to assume the title of Mage, because he knows he is nowhere near as powerful as the four great Mages of legend. Several decades before the book's story begins, he rebels openly against the Sidhe in Sidhedark, starting a magical war in an attempt to stop them from interfering with humanity on Earth. The war horribly ravages a vast swath of land, which becomes known as the Blasted Plain. He loses the war, but he is still powerful enough that the Sidhe cannot kill him, so they cede some territory to him in the cease-fire treaty and make some concessions, allowing him a personal enclave and allowing humans and Breeds to live in peace in the Pact Lands beyond the Blasted Plain. By the time the book's main story takes place, he has built his impression of the wondrous palace described in \\"Kubla Khan\\" and lives there with his concubine and a few retainers. Lamia and her sister Lamia and her sister (unnamed in the novel, but given the name Tristesse in its sequel, The Serpent Mage) are human women, once David Clarkham's wives. After Clarkham was defeated in the war he started, he abandoned both women, and the Sidhe captured them, using their magic to horribly warp their bodies. They now live at the Isomage's old house, which stands on the gateway between the human and Sidhe worlds, which they guard, on the order of the Sidhe, who threaten to do even worse to them should they fail. Some call Lamia \\"the Flesh Egg\\", because of her shape; she is bizarrely rotund. She also appears to be reptilian in a way, as she sheds her skin periodically as her cursed body continues to grow ever more corpulent. Alyons and his coursers Alyons is a Sidhe, exiled to the Pact Lands. He and his riders (coursers) patrol the Pact Lands to ensure that the humans remain where they are. Alyons was assigned this duty as punishment for stealing a horse from the Irall (Temple of Adonna), a serious crime; by the time they found out, it had imprinted upon him and would recognize no other master, so they could not take it back. Alyons is extremely bitter and longs to simply kill all the humans, but the treaty forbids this; if any Sidhe attack any of the humans without provocation, some form of terrible magical retribution will occur, due to spells prepared by the Isomage. Humans of Euterpe * Savarin ‚Äî Henrik Savarin is a former music teacher. He is described as being about forty years old, thin, with bushy, greying brown hair. He has been trapped in Sidhedark for thirty-five years at his best guess, and considers himself a scholar of the Sidhe and their language. When Michael first arrives, Savarin teaches him what he knows and asks Michael to pass on anything of interest that he learns from the Crane Women. Michael later learns that Savarin is part of a group of humans who are planning to rebel against the Sidhe and escape the Pact Lands. * Helena ‚Äî Helena Davies is a former concert pianist from New York who arrived in Sidhedark two years ago. She was the last person to arrive before Michael. Like Savarin, she is part of the human rebellion in Euterpe. Helena is attracted to Michael, but she keeps him at arm's length because she is afraid of conceiving a child. She forms a sexual relationship with Savarin because he is sterile. * Brecker and Risky ‚Äî A husband and wife who run the only hotel in Euterpe. On Lamia's order, they offer Michael room and board in exchange for work when he first arrives in the Realm. * Sherebith ‚Äî Sherebith is the warden of the Yard where the soulless human children born in Sidhedark are housed. The Children call her \\"mother\\". Crane Women The Crane Women, Nare, Spart, and Coom are ancient Breed sisters who live in an isolated hut outside of Halftown. Their true names are Elanare, Esparta, and Ecooma, and they are the daughters of a human father, Aske, and a Sidhe mother, Elme, the daughter of Tonn. They were the first Breeds and may be as much as 9,000 years old. Unlike other Breeds, the Crane Women are respected by the Sidhe for their wisdom and knowledge of the old ways. Young Sidhe initiates are brought to them for training in combat, magic, and mental discipline. Breeds of Halftown * Lirg ‚Äî Lirg of the line of Wis is a Breed who manages the market in Halftown. He keeps no written records and manages all accounts from memory. On the night of the Kaeli, Halftown is raided by Sidhe and Lirg is one of the Breeds taken for sacrifice to Adonna. * Eleuth ‚Äî Eleuth is the daughter of Lirg and a human woman, making her a second generation Breed, only one quarter Sidhe. She is in love with Michael and is not discouraged by the fact that he doesn't return her feelings. Out of love for him, she attempts to use Sidhe magic to return him to earth, but she is not strong enough, leaving Michael trapped between worlds. Eleuth sacrifices herself to allow Michael to escape the guardian and return to the Realm again. Biri Biridashwa ‚Äî called Biri by the Crane Women ‚Äî is a young Sidhe initiate to the priesthood of Adonna. He is brought by Tarax to the Crane Women for training. He has never met a human before Michael. Though Biri is being trained at the same time as Michael, much of Biri's training is kept secret from him and Biri is evasive when questioned. Michael meets Biri again much later after escaping from the Irall. Biri claims to have lost faith in Adonna and the Maln, but Michael doesn't entirely trust his sudden willingness to side with humans. Biri teaches Michael the history of the Council of Eleu, created to promote harmony between humans and Sidhe, and the Maln, created to oppose it. He offers to complete Michael's training in place of the missing Crane Women, but ultimately, Michael rejects Biri's Sidhe philosophy. Tarax and the Maln Tarax is the leader of the Maln, the Black Order, a group of Sidhe warriors who serve Adonna. For untold millennia they have monitored the humans, whom they still hate, making sure that they never regain anything resembling magical power. Lin Piao Tai Lin Piao Tai is a Spryggla, one of the few whom the Sidhe allowed to retain his original form. The Spryggla have the ability to magically manipulate the shape of matter. Lin Piao Tai was tasked by the Sidhe with designing the palace of Kubla Khan which was intended to be an architectural Song of Power, transmitted to the emperor in a dream. However, the dream was interrupted and construction was stymied by an opposing faction, and the palace was never properly built. As punishment for his failure, Lin Piao Tai was imprisoned by the Sidhe. Within his valley prison, Lin Piao Tai is free to do as he wishes, and he has built a beautiful palace for himself, but as a further punishment, his magic over matter has been taken from him except relating to objects that are yellow or golden in color. To a lesser degree, he can also manipulate objects that are black, white, or grey, while red and brown things do not affect and are not affected by his magic. However, the color blue is deadly to him. Nikolai Nikolaevich Kuprin Nikolai was a dancer who came from Leningrad to the United States to dance at the Denishawn school, but he had always been more attracted to music than dance. He was transported to the Realm at the age of fourteen while playing Stravinsky's Rite of Spring on the piano. He arrived in the middle of the final battle of the Isomage's war, and he was caught by magic which aged him. He escaped capture by Alyons and his coursers and was taken in by a sympathetic Sidhe woman in the females' city of Inyas Trai, under the protection of the Ban of Hours. Nikolai introduces Michael to her. Ulath of the line of Wis An attendant to the Ban of Hours, friend to Nikolai. The Ban of Hours The keeper of the Sidhe's records, the Ban of Hours is very powerful but is also fond of humans and of Earth. No one who sees her can remember what she looks like. She is Tonn's daughter, sister of Elme, and she \\"stayed by Tonn when Elme defied him\\", although now she covertly opposes Tarax and the Maln. Emma Livry A human dancer, she was just 20 years old in 1863 when David Clarkham came to her and arranged for her to dance a Song of Power. The Sidhe of the Maln arranged for her to be terribly burned in a fire to prevent this, but the Council of Eleu came, healed her, and took her with them. She lives in the city of Inyas Trai. Tonn/Adonna One of the four most powerful Mages, Tonn created Sidhedark millions of years ago for his people, the Sidhe, to live in when they left Earth. The world he created wasn't as well made as Earth, because it was his work alone. Now, at the time of the book's story, the rest of the Sidhe barely remember him as Tonn and worship him as Adonna, believing him to be a god. He is growing tired, though, and knows that his world will collapse sooner or later, so it will have to be reunified with Earth so the Sidhe can escape Sidehedark's destruction. Tarax and the Maln serve him, but this would be difficult for them to accept, so he does not tell them about this plan.

The first Parmiter's Almshouses were opened in John Street, now Grimsby Street, off Brick Lane in 1722, and were adjacent to the first school. Along with the school, the Almshouses moved to Gloucester Street, now Parmiter Street, Bethnal Green in 1839, where they remained in use until they were destroyed by a V-2 rocket in February 1945. Parmiter's School moved to new premises in Approach Road, Bethnal Green in 1887, and in 1977 the school relocated to Garston, Hertfordshire.A history of the Parmiter's Estate Charity by Andrew Lewis & Brian Coulshed - Published 1999 The move from Bethnal Green to Hertfordshire was not entirely welcomed by the School Trustees based in Bethnal Green, who were very sorry to lose such excellent educational facilities to the detriment of residents of Bethnal Green. In order to solve the loss of the school and the educational resource, it was agreed that the Parmiter's Foundation would provide the sum of ¬£70,000 to be invested so as to enable the Parmiter's Bethnal Green Fund to operate, so as to provide a continuing educational presence in the area, to support the educational needs of those students under the age of 25, who were in financial need, who reside within the old Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. The Trustees have two schemes to fulfill their charitable objectives. Book Grants The Trustees support those local students at University by means of their book grant project, which has been running for several years. Each year students are invited to apply for a book grant of ¬£200 in book tokens to assist with the books required for their courses. The book tokens are awarded at an awards ceremony in Autumn each year to which local Head teachers and officials from the local Authority are invited. Year Two - A Book For You Grants Not all parents of primary aged children are able to afford the purchase of a book for their child at the annual book fairs that Primary Schools hold. The Trustees therefore piloted a project in Bangabandhu Primary School to provide each child in Year 2 with a ¬£10 book token. The pilot was very successful and has been rolled out across all the primary schools within the former Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green.

Taxis\\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 2011, pp. 386‚Äì387. (German). +. Max Emanuel was a member of the former German princely House of Thurn and Taxis, whose wealth derived from founding the German postal service and brewing. Marriages and issue On 20 May 1969 at Schwangau, Max Emanuel entered into a civil marriage, deemed non-compliant with the family's traditional house law, with Anna Maria Gr√§fin von Pocci (1944‚Äì2008), a daughter of Count Konrad Albert von Pocci and his wife Anna Elisabeth Hartmann. They married in a religious ceremony two days later. A childless marriage, they divorced a year later, on 1 July 1970 at Kempten; the marriage was annulled on 17 October 1972 at Augsburg. On 14 March 1973 at Schwangau, he entered into another non-compliant union, civilly marrying Christa Heinle, a daughter of Erich Heinle and his wife Ingeburg Wurzner. The following day, they had a religious ceremony. He and Christa have two sons: * Hubertus Raphael Franz Josef Ulrich Maria Lamoral Prinz von Thurn und Taxis (b. 22 June 1973) * Philipp Gabriel Franz Josef Magnus Maria Lamoral Prinz von Thurn und Taxis (b. 19 April 1975) Building plan tensions Max Emanuel's plans in the late 1990s and early 2000s to develop real estate near historical sites in Bavaria caused tensions with historical societies and others in the local community. He already had a commercial presence in the area, as he ran a \\"sport and seminar\\" center which offered river rafting, mountain biking, paragliding, and golf. In 1997, Max Emanuel planned to build a $22 million luxury hotel with 150 rooms, fine dining, a golf school and adjacent golf course, and a health spa on land directly in view of Neuschwanstein Castle, the famous site built by Ludwig II of Bavaria. These preparations were defeated however, after locals and a conservation society managed to get a local referendum held in 1997 to scrap the plans. Max Emanuel continued his plans four years later to build a hotel and golf course on the same site. People living nearby were upset that the view seen from the castle's grounds would be ruined by new construction meant for tourists; consequently the local council ruled that most of the land surrounding the castle was unusable for commercial development. Max Emanuel responded to these complaints by saying a luxury hotel would draw wealthy visitors to the village and help the local economy; restaurant, shop owners, and other members of the tourist industry tended to favor his plans, while village counselors, local farmers and others were opposed, believing that any commercial development would ruin the rural landscape and create too much noise. Those in favor of King Ludwig's legacy stated that the hotel would violate the romantic legacy the mad king left. A bureaucratic mistake during initial plans four-year previously left one piece of land available for commercial development in 2001, a fact that Max Emanuel was able to take advantage of. With a seat on the council as a Christian Social Union member, he proceeded with plans for a scaled-down leisure complex of 50 rooms and a six-hole golf training course, which the Bavarian state parliament ruled to be legal. Critics complained that even these plans would impede the views of the castle, as it would be easy for further construction to continue building the site up. As a result of these new plans, efforts were quickly underway by various groups, such as the Bavarian Society for the Protection of Nature, to declare the castle and surrounding land a world heritage site. Max Emanuel and his family stated that if the plans were not approved, they would be forced to sell Schloss Bullachberg (the property in the shadow of the castle) as well as a nearby ancestral castle that required restoration; many saw this announcement as a barely concealed threat: if their plans were rejected, these properties might be sold to another developer with even more unpleasant plans for the area. Construction plans still remain in limbo today; in 2006, Porsche Automobil Holding SE acquired the property, intending to continue the project.

Richard Cooke, for instance, acted as both Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State at the same time. The last three Secretary's also held the more powerful positions of Chief Secretary, but the role was only finally ceased to exist after the 1800 Acts of Union when the last Secretary resigned to take up the position of Speaker of the House of Commons.

File ‚ÄúLyceum,‚Äù DeGolyer Library, Manuscript Collection, Dallas, TX. Holding a steady membership of 45-75 women, the Dallas Lyceum club attracted notable individuals of the time, including musicians, authors, and government figures. Background Founded in 1931 by Mrs. Alma Thurman, the Lyceum Club provided a Southern counterpart to the women‚Äôs club movement in the Northern United States. The Lyceum Club‚Äôs mission to explore all disciplines of the humanities paralleled the mission of the first women‚Äôs club, Sorosis, based in New York City. The Southern counterpart that the Lyceum Club provided, however, presented a new take on the usual modes of study of the humanities by specifically calling attention and recognition to Southern artists, authors, and musicians. Membership The club steadily grew in membership numbers that it more than doubled in the first 25 years.1931 history reports 45 members. By 1956 the number reported was 72 members The elected officials led the group using increasingly individual modes of leadership with each passing year. This is reflected in the Spring Parties of the club. While the first Spring Parties of the Lyceum Club took place as a simple tea party at the Dallas Country Club, by the 1950s, the Spring Party could be expected to have a Creole theme to reflect the club‚Äôs study of Southern literature and art. This was due to the Creole background of the current president, who chose to focus the year‚Äôs activities on Creole-influences in the humanities. Official documents The officials of the club would also issue official documents such as the official history of the club in increasingly creative methods, including poems, plays, and song verses. This change in the written histories serves as a clear sign of how members of the Lyceum Club not only studied the world of the creative arts, but also embraced the chance to participate in the creativity themselves. Thus, throughout the decades, the Lyceum Club continued to achieve its original goal to cultivate creativity and understanding of all variations of arts and literature through its bi-monthly meetings.

La Sierra Academy's mission statement states: \\"As a Christian K - 12 college preparatory school, we serve students from diverse backgrounds by providing the learning opportunities and skills needed to contribute to society, to prepare for life's work, and to flourish spiritually.\\" LSA is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system. History La Sierra Academy was founded in the fall of 1922 as a secondary school. The land on which it was founded was formerly part of the 1846 Mexican land grant, Rancho La Sierra. La Sierra Academy's first school bulletin from 1922 stated that its students would \\"learn to render effective service.\\" The school grew into a junior college and later into a full four year liberal arts college. This shift created a need to separate the academy into other academic levels. Thus in 1940, La Sierra College Preparatory School, now known as La Sierra University, was established. In 1955 the school moved to its current location along Pierce Street and Golden Avenue less than a mile away from the University. Academics The required curriculum includes classes in the following subject areas: Religion, English, Oral Communications, Social Studies, Mathematics, Science, Physical Education, Health, Computer Applications, Fine Arts, and Electives. Spiritual aspects All students take religion classes each year that they are enrolled. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines also begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many which encourage student input. Outside the classroom there are spiritually oriented programming that relies on student involvement year-round. Incidents On March 4, 2020, counselor Matthew Johnson was arrested for creation, possession, and distribution of child pornography.

He was a three-time First Team All-Missouri Valley Conference selection and was later named one of the MVC's \\"50 Greatest Players\\" in the conference's history. Beisser attended North High School in Des Moines, Iowa. He had been a first team all-state center and enrolled at Creighton in the fall of 1939. Since college freshmen were not allowed to play varsity sports back then, he had to wait until his sophomore year in 1940‚Äì41. In his three varsity seasons, Beisser was First Team All-MVC, won two outright conference championships (1941, 1943) and shared a co-MVC title with Oklahoma A&M; in 1942, and capped his career with an All-American selection. In 1941, Creighton participated in the third-ever NCAA Tournament, but lost in the first round. In 1942 and 1943, Beisser led the Bluejays to National Invitation Tournament (NIT) appearances. They won the Third Place Game in 1942 over Toledo, 48‚Äì46, but lost in the first round the following year to Washington & Jefferson, 43‚Äì42. Beisser was named to the All-Tournament Team in 1942. After college, Beisser joined the Phillips Oilers in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and teamed with Bob Kurland, a two-time NCAA champion and future Basketball Hall of Famer, to lead the Oilers to three straight national championships in 1946, 1947 and 1948. Phillips then defeated the University of Kentucky in a 1948 Olympic Games playoff match. As a result, Beisser was selected as an alternate for the United States men's national basketball team.

The young girl earns a correspondence course degree as an opera singer and dreams of fame on the stage. She decides to leave her small town life, traveling to Budapest to answer an ad from the Palais de Paris. However, the ad was a sham, a way to get girls for cheap stage shows and more, for its wealthier clientele. When she arrives, Toni is confused when the manager, the lecherous (and quite possibly lesbian) Madame Bauer (Maude George), asks her to show her bare legs in lieu of exhibiting her singing voice. She is hired nonetheless, having been deemed sexy enough, while still ignorant of the set-up. She refuses to wear the skimpy costume assigned and is given a white puritan-style costume instead. Before the show, the manager greets aristocrat Henri D'Avril (Lowell Sherman), giving him a menu (of sorts) of the showgirls from which to choose. When he asks if there is anyone new, he is directed to Toni's name on the program. When Toni begins her performance in earnest, the audience starts to slumber, given her conservative dress. But the manager directs a lighting change, which causes her translucent clothing become highly revealing and quite nearly see-through. Through their reaction, Toni realizes what has happened and runs off the stage where she is comforted by the wardrobe woman, Rosa (Louise Dresser), the only friend she's made since arriving in the city. However, Madame Bauer is not through with Toni yet, she has arranged a rendezvous for her with D‚ÄôAvril in a room off the stage. Once locked inside with Toni, he quickly tries to take advantage. She struggles against his advances which are heard by Rosa, who is able to come to her rescue. When Madame Bauer discovers that her client didn't get what he wanted, she fires Toni and Rosa on the spot. Conveniently, Rosa was about to leave on a two-week vacation anyway and persuades the forlorn Toni to go with her. They go to Monte Carlo, but Toni is now suspicious of other people's motives. So when Rosa signs the Eden Hotel register as Baroness & her daughter, Toni accuses her of being no better than Madame Bauer. However, Rosa has documentation which proves that she is in fact a Baroness, and tells Toni that she signed the registration that way because she wishes it were so. Only much of her fortune was lost after the First World War and she can only afford such trips by living frugally for the rest of the year. Later, when Toni is playing the piano in her room, she is spotted through the window from across the courtyard by Richard (Charles Ray). In an amusing scene, he tries to get her attention by signaling her, turning on & off the lights in his room. As a gag, she responds with same, causing everyone else on his entire side of the hotel to do it too. When Rosa sees it, she stops the nonsense. However, Richard then decides to call Toni's room, but Rosa answers and decides to invite him over to put a stop to it. She plays the piano while she waits for Richard to arrive. But he arrives at Rosa's door, where Toni is. Tired of unwanted suitors, she appears uninterested in his flirting, yet doesn't reveal him when Rosa returns & he hides behind a door. Colonel Dupont (Edward Martindel) arrives to call on Rosa, but is instantly entranced by Toni. In the doorway, he asks the two ladies to dinner which is witnessed by Richard, who just moments earlier had escaped from their room via another door. Upon hearing their acceptance, Richard joins them, revealing that the Colonel is his uncle. After the dinner, Richard takes Toni for a walk through the hotel's grounds and garden (the title of the film) and they fall in love, losing track of the time. The rest of the film has Toni being wooed by both Richard and his uncle with a song one of them wrote on the piano. However, there is a surprise involving D'Avril which threatens Toni's happy ending.

With mobile virtualization, mobile devices can be manufactured more cheaply through the re-use of software and hardware, which shortens development time. One such example is using mobile virtualization to create low-cost Android smartphones without a separate baseband processor by running the applications and the baseband processor code in separate virtual machines on a single processor. Semiconductor vendors such as ST-Ericsson have adopted mobile virtualization as part of their low-cost Android platform strategy. Enterprise Another use case for mobile virtualization is in the enterprise market. Today, many consumers carry two mobile phones: one for business use and another for personal use. With mobile virtualization, mobile phones can support multiple domains/operating systems on the same hardware, so that the enterprise IT department can securely manage one domain (in a virtual machine), and the mobile operator can separately manage the other domain (in a virtual machine). In September 2010, ARM announced that it would support a virtualization extension in its ARM Cortex-A15 processor.  Platforms  Every mobile platform does virtualization differently.  Android  In Android there are many ways to do virtualization, however due to limitations and operating system security restrictions some types of virtualization software will not be able to do all the tasks or run all types of applications.

She then followed her brother, Innico II d'Avalos, to Ischia, where he died in 1503. Later that year, she defended Ischia against the French for four consecutive months, with great skill and bravery. Her services were rewarded by the settlement of the civil and military government of the island on the d'Avalos family, which power it retained until 1734, when its military command was transferred to Naples. She established her court at Ischia, which was frequented by many Neapolitan intellectuals of the period. On 13 June 1507, she signed a marriage contract between her nephew Fernando Francesco d'√Åvalos and Vittoria Colonna. The marriage took place on Ischia in December 1509. Vittoria, shortly after her marriage, spent her time on Ischia with Costanza. In 1523 Charles V granted to Costanza the land which nowadays forms Pescara. She died in 1541, after Charles V had given her the title of Princess of Francavilla. Literary influence On Ischia, Costanza established a circle of literary friends around her, among which were the poet Vittoria Colonna, the wife of her nephew, Sannazaro, Paolo Giovio, Tansillo and Bernardo Tasso. She also became a follower of Juan de Vald√©s and attended his lectures and discussions at his house in Chiaia.

Early life and education Alvan, as he preferred to be called, was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, to James A. Macauley and Rebecca Jane Mills. Macauley's father was a veteran of the American Civil War and was imprisoned for nine months in a Confederate war prison camp. The elder Macauley became the first state treasurer for West Virginia after the Civil War.

Callin, 1890; p. 525.Richard Ellsworth Fast and Hugh Maxwell , The History and Government of West Virginia, Acme Publishing Company, 1901; p. 159. The Macauleys moved to Washington D.C. where Alvan was educated in the public school system. Alvan attended Lehigh University in Pennsylvania and gained an engineering degree. He also graduated from Columbian College (now known as George Washington University) with a law degree. He took a job as a patent attorney with the National Cash Register Company. Macauley married Estelle Littlepage in 1895. Company head Macauley moved to St. Louis in 1901 to become the head of American Arithmometer Company. Macauley revitalized the company and by 1905 sought to expand the operation. He set his eye on a certain alley, but the city was unwilling to give it to him, as his predecessor, who had left the company on angry terms, still had political pull in the city and was blocking the move. Macauley responded by traveling to Detroit, securing an alley there, and returning to St. Louis. At night after business hours, he had the entire factory loaded onto boxcars and shipped to Michigan. The next morning, city officials awoke to find the factory gone. Macauley led American Arithmometer -- which would become Burroughs Adding Machine Company -- for five years in Detroit. In 1910 he was hired as general manager of Packard by Henry Bourne Joy. Packard president Alvan Macauley became the president of Packard in 1916. He oversaw an era when Packard was the leader in the luxury car market. He hired Jesse Vincent, an engineer who led the technical development at Packard. Packard's \\"twin-six\\" twelve-cylinder engine enabled the automaker to step away from the competition and establish itself as an industry leader throughout the 1910s and 1920s. An eight-cylinder car that began production in 1923 became a favorite of European royalty and among the wealthiest American consumers.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 103-4, Random House, New York, NY. . Packard Twin-Six Touring, 1916 The Great Depression devastated the luxury car market. Macauley responded by seeking a foothold in the mid-priced car market. He gained it in 1935 when he hired a team of engineers from Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Chrysler Corporation, who helped Packard produce a car that sold for $980 ‚Äì $650 less than any Packard automobile. The success of the lower-priced car ended the financial crisis at Packard. Macauley stepped down as president of Packard in 1939. He stayed on as chairman of the board until 1948. Macauley was instrumental in the company's decision to produce the powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, which was a key factor in the success of the famous P-51 Mustang fighter in World War II.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 103-4, 107, 217, 342, Random House, New York, NY. . Packard continued to produce mid- priced cars in the years following World War II. Macauley resigned from Packard in 1948 after the company lost its place as the leading luxury-car maker in America to Cadillac. Organizations Macauley served as president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association and the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce. He appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1929 after testifying before the Senate Finance Committee's subcommittee at the behest of Pennsylvania Senator David A. Reed. Time magazine's biography of Macualey noted that he was an avid golfer and woodworker, and an excellent marksman. Macauley had several personality quirks including a dislike of people who jingled the change in their pockets or had gold fillings in their teeth. A sign over his office door proclaimed: \\"Important If True.\\" Often his truths were the only ones that counted at Packard. Macauley died on January 16, 1952, in Clearwater, Florida, from an attack of uremic poisoning and pneumonia. He was survived by his wife, three children, ten grandchildren and fifteen great-grandchildren.

He is particularly known for his colossal work, Die Musik des Mittelalters und der Renaissance (1931), which provided a new perspective on historical musicology by taking a history-of-ideas approach to music history. Life Besseler studied philosophy (under Martin Heidegger), German language, mathematics and natural science in Freiburg im Breisgau. Subsequently, he studied music (under Hans G√°l) and musicology (under Wilibald Gurlitt, Guido Adler and Wilhelm Fischer) in Vienna and Freiburg. In 1923 he obtained a doctoral degree in musicology from the University of Freiburg. The subject of his thesis was the history and stylistic development of dance suites in seventeenth-century Germany. After further studies at the University of G√∂ttingen, he wrote a professorial thesis on medieval music, spanning the years between 1250 and 1350. From 1928 he taught at the University of Heidelberg.Horst Seeger, Musiklexikon: Personen A‚ÄìZ (Leipzig: Deutscher Verlag f√ºr Musik, 1981).

Written and directed by Paul Lieberstein, the episode aired on NBC in the United States on October 14, 2010. The episode features the return of several recurring characters, most notably Melora Hardin as Jan Levinson, Linda Purl as Helene Beesly, and Nancy Carell as Carol Stills. Actresses Amy Pietz and Amy Ryan ‚Äî who portray Donna Newton and Holly Flax ‚Äî only make vocal cameos, though Ryan is credited as a starring role. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) comes to work thinking he has a pimple, but it turns out to actually be a cold sore. When he is told that it is a form of herpes, Michael contacts all his ex-girlfriends‚ÄîJan, Holly, Helene, Donna, and Carol. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) holds a sex education meeting in the office hoping to learn if Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is having sex with her boyfriend, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Along with several actresses reprising their characters, \\"Sex Ed\\" also saw the introduction of warehouse worker Nate Nickerson, played by Mark Proksch; he would go on to recur for the remainder of the series. \\"Sex Ed\\" was viewed by 7.36 million viewers and received a 3.8 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, marking a slight increase in the ratings when compared to the previous week. The episode was also the highest-ranked NBC series of the night, but it received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom felt that Michael was characterized as too stupid and that Andy's subplot was not compelling. Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arrives to the office with a fake mustache to hide what he thinks is a pimple over his mouth. Michael soon learns that it is a cold sore, which is a form of herpes. With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion. Much to Michael's dismay, she claims that he over-romanticized their relationship, and he hangs up without telling her about the herpes. Michael and Dwight drive out to tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl). Michael and Dwight meet with Jan, who is now a fairly successful office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with Cece at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that he does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) uses the situation to host a sex education class, with the ulterior motive to learn if his former girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) has been having sex with her current boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). During the lesson, he disturbs the office with pictures of genitalia, cannot come up with any negatives to sex besides STD's, and attempts to use a pencil for a condom demonstration. Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza at the wall and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy that he is going to let this whole situation slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him. Andy is cheered up when he receives a pep talk from Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), despite Darryl having no idea what his problem is. Production alt=A red-haired man wearing a blue T-shirt looking directly forward and smiling. \\"Sex Ed\\" was written and directed by showrunner and executive producer Paul Lieberstein, who also plays Toby Flenderson on the show. The episode features several return appearances of former recurring characters. Amy Ryan appears in a voice-only role as Holly Flax, who was last seen in the fifth season finale, \\"Company Picnic\\". Melora Hardin appears as Jan Levinson, who was last seen in the fifth season episode, \\"Baby Shower\\". Amy Pietz appears as Donna, also in a voice-only role; she had a recurring role near the end of the sixth season. Linda Purl appears as Helene Beesly, who had a recurring role in the sixth season. Nancy Carell, the actual wife of Steve Carell, appears as Carol Stills, who was last seen in the third season episode, \\"A Benihana Christmas\\". Ryan would return later in the season as a way to provide Carell an exit from the series. Hardin would make a cameo appearance in the later season seven episode \\"Threat Level Midnight\\", as well as two appearances in the ninth season episodes \\"The Whale\\" and \\"Couples Discount\\". \\"Sex Ed\\" is the first episode to feature Dwight's assistant Nate, played by YouTube star Mark Proksch. After the producers of The Office saw a series of prank videos that Proksch did under the name \\"Kenny Strasser\\", they hired him to become a recurring character. The official website of The Office included one deleted scene from \\"Sex Ed\\". In the clip, Kelly asks Jim how she should deal with Ryan not completely loving her. The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. The cut scenes include Dwight looking up how herpes is spread, Dwight discussing how Holly brings out \\"a child-like wonder in Michael\\", Michael contacting the French-Canadian concierge he had a brief relationship with in the fifth season episode \\"Business Trip\\", and more cut scenes from Andy's sex ed discussion. In addition, an entire subplot was deleted from the episode. This story involved the camera crew catching Pam and Jim in the middle of a fight; the crew then tries to determine what caused them to fight in the first place. Cultural references Michael compares himself to Canadian pop punk musician Avril Lavigne, noting that both of them get pimples. Andy sings a parody of Foreigner's 1978 hit single \\"Hot Blooded\\" about pizza. Jan mentions that she released \\"an album of Doris Day covers on [her] own label\\". Reception \\"Sex Ed\\" first aired on NBC on October 14, 2010. In its original American broadcast it was viewed by an estimated 7.36 million viewers and received a 3.8 rating/10 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that 3.8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-old households watched the episode, and ten percent of that demographic had their televisions tuned to the channel at any point. This marked a slight increase in viewers from the previous episode. Jonathan Teigland of Starpulse called the episode \\"simple and silly\\". He applauded the final scene with Holly, writing that it was the \\"best\\" of Michael's reconnection with his ex-girlfriends. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three out of five stars, calling it \\"a miss\\". He felt that none of the encounters with Michael's former girlfriends were \\"funny\\", and that \\"the meetings themselves left a lot to be desired\\". He was also critical of Andy's subplot, writing that \\"very little about the execution worked.\\" Forcella did, however, call Michael's conversation with Holly \\"classic\\". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"C+\\" and felt that Michael's antics‚Äîlargely the fact that he easily believes he has herpes‚Äîwere too stupid to be believable; however, he felt that the episode's main story largely worked as planned. However, McNutt panned the episode's secondary story focusing on Andy, noting that it \\"lazily tapped into the series' basic structure\\". He ultimately concluded that \\"without any particularly strong jokes, it fell entirely on Andy's character, and there just wasn't enough there to support it\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that, while Michael's story \\"had its moments\\", it was largely \\"creepy and uncomfortable\\". He also criticized Andy's characterization, noting that, in the episode, he was written extremely similar to Michael.

They were cousins of the Reverend William Tisdall of Belfast, who nowadays is best remembered for his wish to marry Esther Johnson, the beloved Stella of Jonathan Swift; this connection may explain the interest which Swift in old age took in fostering Philip's career.Falkiner p.415 He was educated at Thomas Sheridan's school in Dublin, and at the University of Dublin, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1722.Falkiner p.415 He entered Middle Temple in 1723 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1733.Hart, A.

He had been elected as member for Armagh in 1768, but chose to continue sitting for the University.William John Fitzpatrick Ireland Before the Union p,32 1867 In 1742 he was appointed Third Serjeant, then Solicitor- General in 1751 and Attorney-General in 1760.Burke, Sir Bernard History of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland Pall Mall London 1871 Vol.II p.1384 He was also appointed judge of the Prerogative Court of Ireland, an office he held from 1745 to his death.Hart p.183 In 1763 he became Principal Secretary of State, and on 28 February 1764 he was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland.Fitzpatrick p.32 For almost 20 years he was a crucial figure in the Irish Government, which relied on him on to manage the Irish House of Commons, a task which he performed with great skill and tact.Falkiner p.145 Tisdall was almost all-powerful until 1767, when George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend arrived as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Townshend had a mandate to restore the direct power of the Crown over Irish affairs and to bypass the Irish political managers like Tisdall.Hart p.97 To his credit, Townshend recognised that Tisdall's support was still an asset to the Government, and made great efforts to conciliate him.Hart p.97 Townshend lobbied hard for Tisdall to be appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland, but came up against the inflexible British reluctance, which endured for many years afterwards, to appoint an Irishman to this crucial office.Falkiner p.145 Tisdall retained the confidence of successive Lords Lieutenants: in 1777, despite his age and failing health, he was asked to resume his role as Government leader in the House of Commons: he agreed, but died at Spa, Belgium on 11 September the same year.Falkiner p.145 Family Mary Tisdall (Angelica Kauffmann, ca. 1771/72) He married in 1736 Mary Singleton, daughter of the Rev. Rowland Singleton and Elizabeth Graham, and niece and co-heiress of Henry Singleton, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, a marriage which brought him both wealth and influence.Burke p.1384 They had three daughters: *Elizabeth, who married Colonel Hugh Morgan of Cottlestown, County Sligo, and had issue *Alicia, who married Thomas Meredyth : they were the parents of Sir John, first of the Meredyth baronets of Carlandstown, County Meath * Mary, who died unmarried.Burke p.1384 Mary Singleton Tisdall (nick-named \\"la belle Marie\\") was renowned for her beauty and as a patron of the arts. In particular she was the principal Irish patron of the celebrated Swiss painter Angelica Kauffman, who visited the Tisdalls regularly in Dublin in the early 1770s and painted Philip, Mary and their daughters.Falkiner p.146 Character He was strikingly dark in complexion, hence his nicknames \\"Black Phil\\" and \\"Philip the Moor\\", and was described as \\"grave in manner and sardonic in temper\\". Despite his somewhat forbidding appearance, he was a hospitable character, who was noted for entertaining lavishly, even when he was well into his seventies, both at his Dublin house in South Leinster Street, and his country house at Stillorgan (now a suburb of Dublin).

The fort was designed for defence, as is evidenced by the number of walls and ditches around the site. Several large triangular platforms have been uncovered around the sides of the fort, lower down on the hillside. Nearly one hundred storage pits of various sizes were cut into the bedrock, and many of these had human remains, coins, and other artefacts in them. During the 19th and 20th centuries the fort has suffered damage and been threatened with complete destruction on multiple occasions. The site has been designated a Scheduled monument; it falls within the Weston Woods Local Nature Reserve which was declared to Natural England by North Somerset Council in 2005.  History  Animated LIDAR data of Worlebury Camp In The Ancient Entrenchments and Camps of Gloucestershire, Edward J. Burrow mentions that probably either the Goidel or Brython people initially built Worlebury Camp. The Belgae people subsequently overthrew the initial inhabitants and occupied the camp for a time, but they were finally destroyed at the hands of the Romans. Worlebury Camp has been explored at various times over a period of 150 years. From 1851 to 1852, Charles Dymond, Edwin Martin Atkins, and Francis Warre excavated and surveyed Worlebury Camp. Dymond returned in 1880 to continue the excavation, which lasted until 1881. Another century passed before the Woodspring Museum from Weston-super-Mare excavated more of Worlebury camp in 1987 to 1988. Finally, in 1998, the Avon Extensive Urban Study team performed the latest (as of 2008) assessment of the site. A condition survey undertaken in 2017-18 resulted in a request for an analytical earthwork survey which was undertaken by Historic England in 2018-19. This revealed some evidence about the use of the hillfort and its later history but many questions remain.  Location  Plan of the camp The fort is located on the summit of Worlebury Hill, above sea level. It is in the present-day North Somerset, above the seaside resort of Weston-super-Mare and close to the village of Worle. Its occupants would have had a view of the countryside as well as any potential invaders. They would have been able to see out over to Sugar Loaf Mountain, the Black Mountains, the Mendip Hills, Dunkery Beacon, Sand Point, and Wales. This view is no longer as unobstructed as it once was because there are so many trees spread over the hill.  Archaeological findings =Platforms There are a number of triangular platforms on the slopes around the fort. The apexes of these triangles are flush with the hillside, with the base projecting in the downhill direction. However, the upper surface is approximately level. The front faces of these platforms are about above the hillside, and they have ditches in front of them to improve their defence. In a letter to Warre, Atkins theorised that the structures were slingers' platforms or archers' stations. Several sling stones have been found around them, offering some credence to the theory that slingers stood upon these platforms. Dymond mentions the stones in his book:  Walls and ditches  An artist's rendition of Worlebury Camp from a book published in 1886 Worlebury Hill is bordered on its north and west sides by steep cliffs dropping down into the Bristol Channel between Weston Bay and Sand Bay. These would have rendered the fort nearly invulnerable to attack from those directions. Nevertheless, the fort still has one wall on its north side and one on its west side, both very near the edge of the cliffs. On the south side, a single rampart and a ditch guarded the fort. The level east side was protected by two stone ramparts and five ditches. Parts of these ramparts were over high measuring from the bottom of the ditch as of 1875. The walls themselves are around thick. However, because they are dry-laid stone, the removal of a few stones would be sufficient to bring the entire wall collapsing down. To prevent access to the walls themselves, the inhabitants of the fort raised large breastworks around the base of the walls by piling up rock rubble against the bases. These rubble barriers are over high, and in places they are over thick. Attackers would have had to clear away the rubble before being able to attack the wall, and all the while they would be under direct fire from defenders on the top of the wall.  Storage pits  Storage pits The area inside the outer wall has a series of hut circles and 93 storage pits cut directly into the bedrock, which is only around beneath the surface of the soil in most places. Eighteen of the Storage pits are in what Dymond calls the \\"keep\\", one is in the transverse fosse (a fosse is a ditch usually dug for protection), and seventy-four of the pits are outside the \\"keep\\" but still enclosed within the exterior walls. The average size of the pits is around long by 2 metres wide and deep. The largest pit is roughly triangular, with sides measuring , , and long. The smallest pit is long by wide. The inhabitants used them to store grain, as is evidenced by the kernels of barley and wheat and the shards of pots that were found in the pits. Several of the pits contained the remnants of peas and the remains of burned woven baskets. In addition, researchers also found sling stones and spindle whorls dated to the 1st or 2nd century BC in them. A skull, found during Dymond's second exploration, which is gouged with many cuts from an edged weapon. (Drawn in 1886 for Dymond's book, Worlebury:An Ancient Stronghold in the County of Somerset.) Eighteen of these pits were found to contain the remains of human skeletons, which are now stored in the Weston- super-Mare Museum in Weston-super-Mare. Eighteen full skeletons were found, of which ten show evidence of a violent death (including sword cuts in the skulls). It is possible that the Romans or the Belgic raiders attacked the fort and killed the inhabitants.  Artefacts  A cast copper alloy penannular collar of special interest to archaeologists has been found at the campsite. It may indicate that this hilltop site was used even before the Iron Age, since related artefacts tend to be found with Bronze Age items, and it was the first of its type found in Britain. In 2006, a related copper penannular brooch dating to the 5th or 6th century AD was found in a spring between Brecon Beacons and the Black Mountains in Wales. A gold penannular bracelet was found in the Perry River. (pp. 73‚Äì74) Roman coins have been found at Worlebury Camp since the Romans had established a presence by the end of the 1st century AD. Many of the Roman coins bear the image of the Western Roman Emperor Honorius. This was inside the fort proper. Another coin was located by Trinity Path which leads towards the fort. Other findings at the site include animal remains, including the bones of pigs, oxen, horses, deer, goats, and even small birds. Limpet shells have also been found near the bones. Archaeologists found iron objects, adding further credibility to the idea that this fort is from the Iron Age. These objects include a chisel or borer, several spearheads and javelin heads, and an iron cone with charred wood inside and a rivet hole through the cone. Dymond assumes that this cone was once a plowshare. Stone artefacts, mainly slingstones and scrapers, have been discovered at the site. Just less than 36 flint chips have been found, of which some may be arrowheads. One good-quality arrowhead has been found. In addition to these, Dymond recorded finding a lead lump about the size of a walnut that he decided was probably a sling bullet. Glastonbury type bead-rim pottery was also found at this site. A socketed bronze axe from the late Bronze Age, which was found at Worlebury Hill in 1883, is in the Ashmolean Museum.  Damage to the site  19th century quarry on the south side of the hill, seen looking north from \\"South Road\\"  19th century  Development of Weston-super-Mare since the 19th century has resulted in three episodes of potentially irreversible damage to the site. A quarry started operation in the southern side of Worlebury Hill in 1815 to mine for galena, calamine, and stone. The Bristol and Exeter Railway arrived in Weston-super-Mare in 1841, making it profitable to expand the village into a town. In 1842, Weston-super- Mare became a town with the granting of the Improvement and Market Act of May 1842. This act also proposed developing houses right over the brow of the hill. This would have gone straight through Worlebury Camp; however, the actual expansion never reached the site. By 1853, some development had occurred according to the proposed expansion, but it had skirted the hillfort and continued to the east.  20th century  In the early 20th century, the Worlebury fort itself was damaged by boys rolling stones, including some from the walls of the fort, down the hill on which it stands. The Axbridge District of the Somerset Archaeological Society was taking steps to prevent such damage from happening again.  21st Century  Some of the trees planted in the early 19th century had become very large, and their roots were growing into the archaeological structures. In 2005, the Forestry Commission gave permission for North Somerset Council to fell 300 trees to reduce the subsequent risks. A member of the North Somerset Council, Christopher Richards, said: \\"If we had a storm up here and these trees came down, then the entire hillfort could be destroyed.\\" The site was added to the Heritage at Risk Register in 2017, its condition noted as 'declining'. A condition survey and an analytical earthwork survey revealed some evidence about the use of the hillfort and its later history but many questions remain. In 2020 the council initiated a consultation on plans to remove more \\"thousands\\" of trees to protect the remains.

The film is an amnesia thriller dealing with a man's attempts to piece together a sequence of strange events in which he seems to have been involved during the time of which he has no memory, based on the novel To Dusty Death by Hugh McCutcheon. Plot Safe- designer Richard Logan (Franklyn) comes to consciousness on a patch of waste ground with no recollection of how he came to be there. Assuming he must have been attacked and hit over the head, but feeling no apparent ill-effects, he returns home to wife Julie (Redmond) to apologise for being late and tell his story. He is astonished to learn from Julie that he has been missing not for a few hours, but for three weeks. Furthermore, a troubling series of events has occurred during his absence, which appear to point to his involvement in criminal activity. A safe which he personally installed in a large house has been robbed and its contents stolen, with no explanation as to how its supposedly foolproof security mechanisms were so easily overridden. In an attempt to trace her missing husband, Julie has employed a private detective, who discovered evidence implicating Richard of involvement with another woman, and more seriously the private detective has recently been found murdered. Richard enlists Julie's help in trying to recover his memory of the peculiar goings-on of which he has no recollection. He soon becomes aware that he is being trailed by a group of mysterious men. Meanwhile, in his confused mental state he is constantly tantalised by seemingly random and trivial things - a snatch of a popular song or a conversational nuance - which seem to strike a chord with him, for reasons for which he cannot account. He starts to experience flashbacks so momentary and fleeting that they are gone before his conscious mind can seize them. He begins to question the validity of the assumptions on which he is working, wondering if he may indeed have been involved in criminal activity which his mind has blocked out as a defence mechanism, and even begins to doubt Julie's integrity, questioning whether she may have far more knowledge of, and personal involvement in, what has been happening than she is letting on. He is lured to a country house which is blown up. The resulting intrigue finally appears to jolt his memory back into place, and he believes he has found the explanation for what has been going on.

The episode originally aired live on the NBC television network in the United States on October 14, 2010, with separate tapings for the East Coast television audience as well as the West Coast. \\"Live Show\\" featured appearances by Rachel Dratch, Bill Hader, Matt Damon, Jon Hamm, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. 30 Rock follows the production of the fictional sketch comedy program The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). In this episode, on the night of a show, head writer Liz Lemon grows increasingly infuriated when no one seems to remember her 40th birthday. Just before TGSs live taping, Tracy Jordan decides to break character, to his co-workers' chagrin. Meanwhile, television executive Jack Donaghy struggles with the consequences of his promise to give up drinking while his girlfriend Avery Jessup is pregnant with their child. \\"Live Show\\" was an experiment for 30 Rock‚Äîfilming with a multiple-camera setup before a studio audience to broadcast live‚Äîand the episode received positive reviews for its boldness as well as the nostalgia it showed for classic sitcom conventions and meta- humor‚Äîfor instance, guest star Louis-Dreyfus portrays Liz Lemon in some cutaway scenes where it would be physically impossible for series regular Fey to be on two separate stages at once. The episode was also a ratings success, improving upon the audience that 30 Rock had grown since its previous season. On June 22, 2020, it was revealed that the East Coast version would be one of the episodes being pulled from syndication due to issues with the presence of blackface and other racially insensitive humor, however, the West Coast version will remain since it did not include the offending scene. Plot Liz Lemon‚Äîthe head writer of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS)‚Äîis preparing to air another episode of TGS, but is angry that her co-workers have forgotten her 40th birthday. Tracy Jordan frustrates her further by deciding to break character during the show's live broadcast in an homage to The Carol Burnett Show. TGS co-star Jenna Maroney is determined to not let Tracy upstage her and declares she will have a deliberate wardrobe malfunction and bare her breast on live television if Tracy does not stop. As the show goes awry due to Tracy and Jenna's unprofessionalism, Liz is forced to cut away from their regularly scheduled programming to commercials for Dr. Leo Spaceman's new album of erotic ballads to cure erectile dysfunction and Drew Baird's public service announcement for hand-transplant surgery. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy struggles with a promise that he made to his girlfriend Avery Jessup‚Äîhe will not drink alcohol during her entire pregnancy in a show of solidarity with her. Instead, he takes up knitting and stage magic, but finds the urge to drink so strong that he begins sniffing paint cans and Jenna's breath just to get a whiff of alcohol. During TGS, Liz gets a phone call from her boyfriend airline pilot Carol informing her that he is going through extreme turbulence and may crash his plane. In the final act of the show, Jack conspires with the cast and crew to give Liz a last-minute birthday surprise which he wants to appear as though it had been planned all along. Meanwhile, Carol safely lands his plane and rushes to greet Liz on set. All they can muster on short notice is a polka band and a large cake with Fonzie on it‚Äîgifts that were intended to celebrate janitor Jadwiga's birthday. She proceeds to ruin the TGS goodnights and tear into the cake with her bare hands. In Jack's office, Liz and Jack share a drink as Liz's birthday wish. In the final scene, as Jack takes a drink, the program reverts to a pre-recorded segment and Jack says, \\"That's more like it.\\" The episode ends with a live goodnight from the TGS stage by the cast of the episode, a la Saturday Night Live. Production Studio 8H in the GE Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza is where Saturday Night Live (SNL) is filmed and was used as the location for \\"Live Show\\". 30 Rock is loosely based on creator Tina Fey's experience on that program and several SNL alumni participated in the filming of this episode. \\"Live Show\\" was co-written by series creator, executive producer, and lead actress Fey and co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock. It was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, a long-time television director who worked with Fey on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. On July 30, 2010, the NBC network announced that an episode of 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made in part due to lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode \\"Secrets and Lies\\" as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said \\"[The live performance] was what made us think that it would be fun to do [a live episode]. And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV.\\" In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. \\"It will be exciting for us to do it for a live audience and see if we get live laughter.\\" Fey noted that the experience \\"was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show.\\" In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years \\"because we felt we had sort of interesting personnel for it.\\" Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Miller‚Äîa recurring 30 Rock director‚Äîwas available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace season 8 premiere episode, \\"Alive and Schticking\\". Prior to the broadcast, the cast rehearsed \\"Live Show\\" for three days and had one rehearsal before a live audience the day of broadcast. The two separate broadcasts of the episode resulted in a live telecast to American viewers in both the East and West Coasts of the United States (with viewers in the Central Time Zone receiving the East Coast feed live, per standard U.S. broadcasting practice)‚Äîthe crew briefly considered a third broadcast for the Mountain Time Zone, but decided against it. The initial East Coast broadcast included a theme song sung by Jane Krakowski and the later West Coast version's song was performed by Cheyenne Jackson‚Äîthe two also performed to warm-up the crowd in the rehearsal. In addition, the two episodes had a few scripted differences, such as the lyrics to Spaceman's song, Liz Lemon mocks Jack Donaghy's office assistant Jonathan by referring to him as a character from Slumdog Millionaire in the East Coast broadcast and as Aladdin in the West Coast airing, and the subtitle in the Fox News skit. Additionally, the fictional commercial that featured Drew Baird is different‚Äîin the East Coast broadcast he is given a hand transplant from an executed black man; in the West Coast broadcast he has a woman's hand. This episode marks Rachel Dratch's first appearance on 30 Rock since season one, and her first work since giving birth to her son Eli on August 24, 2010. The DVD includes the West Coast version as a bonus feature, but not the entire East Coast version. Instead, the primary version of the episode as presented on DVD is edited together from both East and West, trimmed for time (some scenes are missing and some transitions and awkward pauses are shortened), and presented with standard cast and crew credits (as opposed to the SNL-style crawl), presumably to fit standard rerun length and format. The mix-and-match episode uses the West Coast version for most of the first seven-and-a-half minutes (except Jenna's East Coast title sequence), cuts Jenna's \\"It's Your Birthday, Slut\\" sequence and the second Yadwiga scene (\\"sit on it\\") entirely, and uses West for various short parts (including, most likely, part of the Fox News sketch preparation, half a minute before Carol's phone call, a minute from the last few moments of the call to \\"I will slip a nip\\", the first twenty seconds of Jack's paint can sniffing scene, Jenna's nip slip threat before the second commercial (\\"to commercial go!\\"), possibly Jack's Capital One plug, and the last seventy seconds or so of the birthday cake scene). It doesn't use the West Coast version for the next moments of the paint can scene where Jack's grammar is corrected. As a result, some differences outlined in the other Alternate Versions entry won't be available to anyone with the DVD, including the Slumdog Millionaire variant listed above and many flubs and goofs. Connection with television tropes Long-time SNL producer Lorne Michaels was on hand at the rehearsal and both performances for \\"Live Show\\" to offer his support. As the live broadcast of \\"Live Show\\" was recorded with TV cameras edited live to video rather than film stock, the video quality for this episode was noticeably different from standard episodes of 30 Rock. Jack acknowledges this at the start of the episode by asking why everything looks like a \\"Mexican soap opera.\\" Throughout the episode, the characters broke the fourth wall: Tracy Jordan's unprofessional acting within the TGS episode, Jack's references to the video quality, Julia Louis-Dreyfus' portrayal of Liz in cut-away sequences, and the re-hashing of standard sitcom plot elements. In addition, there were several connections with SNL: Fey, Morgan, Dratch, Bill Hader, Louis-Dreyfus, Parnell, and director McCarthy- Miller are all SNL alumni (fellow alumnus Will Ferrell was asked to reprise his recurring \\"Bitch Hunter\\" character, but had a scheduling conflict); the show was filmed in SNLs Studio 8H before a live audience; the ending sequence was a good night from the cast while the credits scrolled (and the credits used the same font as SNL); and promos leading up to the episode were voiced by long-time SNL announcer Don Pardo. The music for the episode‚Äîboth for the TGS sequences and incidental underscore‚Äîwas provided live by the SNL house band under the direction of Fey's husband Jeff Richmond and Leon Pendarvis. Furthermore, long-time SNL producer Lorne Michaels attended the rehearsal and performances to give his advice. Each commercial break during the show was predicated on an emergency commercial break on TGS, including a fictional commercial and a fake NBC technical difficulties screen. Reception Julia Louis-Dreyfus' unexpected portrayal of Liz Lemon was praised by critics. \\"Live Show\\" drew in the largest audience for 30 Rock, season five, with 6.701 million viewers, and reached a season high 3.1 Nielsen rating/9% share with adults 18‚Äì49, which was a 43% increase over the previous episode and a 15% increase from the season premiere; it trailed CBS competitor and timeslot leader $h*! My Dad Says by 0.1. This rating was the show's highest since December 10, 2009, episode \\"Secret Santa\\" and the highest overall for NBC in the 8:30 p.m. Thursday timeslot for non-sports events since December 2009. Critical reception of the episode was largely positive. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A‚àí, noting the nostalgia for classic television and specifically three-camera sitcoms that this episode displayed. While the pace and tone of \\"Live Show\\" were different from a standard episode of 30 Rock, the author considers this episode, \\"an experiment, as a weird hybrid of 30 Rock, an old sitcom, and Saturday Night Live\\" and ultimately a success. James Poniewozik of Time also wrote that the episode was uneven, but successful as a tribute to television. TV Squad's Bob Sassone was impressed by the episode, specifically Fey's performance and Louis-Dreyfus' imitation of Liz Lemon. Other positive reviews have noted the lack of mistakes in the comic timing and performance, the strength of the guest stars, and the performers' ability to keep up the pace that is expected in a 30 Rock episode. Frazier Moore of the Associated Press gave the episode a negative review, calling it \\"vaudevillian\\" and \\"a slice of self-indulgence and excess.\\" Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald considered the episode \\"so-so\\" due to its \\"humdrum script.\\" As a live television experiment, reviewers have considered it a success, particularly in reference to other live broadcast experiments, such as NBC drama ERs 1997 episode \\"Ambush\\" and SNL, with Entertainment Weekly declaring it \\"like SNL, only funny.\\" In reviewing the best television programs of 2010, The A.V. Club named 30 Rock number 18 and cited this episode as amongst the best of the year. McCarthy-Miller was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for this episode. On March 21, 2012, Baldwin announced in an interview with Extra that a second live episode‚Äî\\"Live from Studio 6H\\"‚Äîwould air the following April 26.

Charles Stewart (May 21, 1927 - January 20, 2017) was an American photographer best known for his portraits of jazz singers and musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, John Coltrane, Ella Fitzgerald, and Miles Davis, as well as artists in the R&B; and salsa genres. Stewart's photographs have graced more than 2,000 album covers. Early life Stewart was born in Henrietta, TexasSteven Otfinoski African Americans in the Visual Arts, New York: Facts on File, 2003, p. 193 and grew up in Tucson, Arizona. His father, Hugh Paris Stewart, was a chef while his mother, Anne Harris, was a domestic worker. He received a Kodak Brownie camera as a present when he was 13 years old and used it that same day to take photos of Marian Anderson, who had come to visit his school. After they were developed, he was able to sell his photos for two dollars, making him a professional photographer from his first day he took pictures. He attended Ohio University as a photography major, one of the only two universities in the United States that offered the program at the collegiate level and the only one that would then accept African American students.Beckerman, Jim. \\"Chuck Stewart's photo portraits of jazz greats on display at bergenPAC\\", The Record (Bergen County), October 14, 2010.

He graduated in 1949, was drafted into the Army and worked as a military photographer, photographing atomic bomb tests in 1952. Career While in college, his friendship with photographer Herman Leonard helped him make connections with record companies in New York City. His clients would include Impulse, Mercury, Reprise and Verve, for whom he took cover photos of artists such jazz and R&B; icons as Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Ray Charles, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Lionel Hampton, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Charles Mingus, Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington, appearing on more than 2,000 albums and in publications including Esquire, Paris Match and The New York Times, as well as in the Encyclopedia of Jazz by jazz journalist Leonard Feather. He also worked for Chess Records in Chicago (and its Argo subsidiary). Stewart always tried to capture his subjects in as flattering a pose as possible, saying \\"I didn't want them picking their nose or scratching their behind. It was important to me that I take a picture of a person in a manner that I thought they looked best.\\" During the 1950s and 1960s he was turned down for more lucrative advertising photography when agencies said that their clients \\"don't have black people down here sweeping the floors\\" and would rather resign the account than accept him.

The Rwandan genocide is widely acknowledged by genocide scholars to have been one of the biggest modern genocides, as many sources point to the sheer scale of the death toll as evidence for a systematic, organized plan to eliminate the victims. Denial of the Rwandan genocide is a crime in Rwanda. Denial by officials A high-ranking Tutsi and a UN official have claimed that no genocide of the Tutsi took place at all: Antoine Nyetera, who claims Tutsi royal origins, and the former UN Representative in Rwanda, Jacques-Roger Booh- Booh, who declared that \\"to claim that a genocide occurred is closer to the politics of surrealism than to the truth\\". Herman and Peterson In The Politics of Genocide (2010), writers Edward S. Herman and David Peterson, while not denying the scale of the killing during the period of extreme violence of April‚ÄìJuly 1994, questioned the distribution of the victims for those months, arguing that Hutus comprised the majority of the dead, not Tutsis. Their detractors have charged them with genocide denial, accusations that have been rejected by Herman and Peterson.Edward Herman (19 July 2011). \\"Reply to George Monbiot on 'Genocide Belittling.

The two men are critical of fundamental aspects of the Human Rights Watch report by Alison Des Forges, and maintain that she obfuscates the issue of who assassinated Habyarimana (they argue it was clearly the RPF) and that, contrary to the conclusions of Des Forges's report, the only well-planned regimen of massive violence perpetrated after the assassination was the RPF's invasion to drive the Hutu from power.. Herman and Peterson ultimately conclude that the RPF were \\"prime g√©nocidaires\\", while the Interahamwe were \\"the RPF's actual victims.\\". Their book argues that the accepted version of the events of 1994 implies Rwanda is \\"the first case in history in which a minority population, suffering destruction at the hands of its tormentors, drove its tormentors from power and assumed control of a country, all in the span of less than one hundred days\\", a narrative Herman and Peterson deem \\"incredible in the extreme.\\".

In the Canadian West, the town of Nanton, Alberta is named for him, and twelve cities and towns have streets named 'Nanton'. Committed to victory in the Great War, he gave over half of his fortune to the war effort and worked himself to an early grave supporting Canadian soldiers in Europe while maintaining Winnipeg's economy. In recognition of his war services he was knighted by George V in 1917 and made a Knight of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. He died in office as President of The Dominion Bank in Toronto, but is most closely associated with Winnipeg, his home for over forty years and where he is buried. Early life in Toronto Born in 1860, he was the second son of (Daniel) Augustus Nanton (1831‚Äì1873) and his wife Louisa (1831-1906), daughter of William Botsford Jarvis of Rosedale. His middle name was for his uncle and godfather, Edmund Allen Meredith. Nanton's father, a barrister and partner of Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt, had emigrated from England where he had been educated at Eton and Oxford. But in Canada the father became an hopeless alcoholic and died at an early age leaving behind a widow, five young children and heavy debts. His mother, who had been to Finishing school in Paris, survived by teaching French and taking charity from her sister, Mrs Meredith, and their family friend, Sir Casimir Gzowski.Winnipeg, 1912. By Jim Blanchard At the age of thirteen, Augustus Nanton took the decision to leave school and find employment to help support his family. He worked as an office boy in the brokerage firm of Pellatt & Osler of Toronto, earning $300 a year. At the same time, he took a job cleaning a grocery store for $200 a year, sleeping under the counter to act as a night watchman. This income helped his mother with her debts and when still a teenager he paid for his brother (the future Brigadier-General Herbert Colborne Nanton R.E., who married a daughter of Sir Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbini√®re) to attend the Royal Military College of Canada. He also found the time to join The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, row with the Argonaut Rowing Club and crew aboard a yacht at Oakville. In 1881, Nanton acted as Best man at the marriage of his employer's son, Sir Henry Pellatt of Casa Loma. Developing the Canadian West Sir Augustus Nanton in Winnipeg The firm for which he worked had since become known as Osler & Hammond, and the decision was made to invest in the Canadian West, which required opening an office in Winnipeg. Under the control of the head offices in Toronto and Aberdeen, the firm of Osler, Hammond & Nanton was created with Nanton as resident partner in Winnipeg. It was not an easy start, and at first Nanton was severely disappointed by the lack of the branch's growth, but he didn't give up and by 1896 the North of Scotland shareholders were told that the subsidiary firm in Winnipeg had become \\"the largest and best mortgage business in the west\\".Osler & Hammond Chairman's Annual Report, Aberdeen, 28 December 1897. Osler, Hammond & Nanton entered the Canadian West representing a considerable fortune, but their business was not centred on quick profits. The company came to represent standards of scrupulous honesty and thoroughness from which they never deviated and became an important link between financiers in Britain, Montreal and Toronto in the development of the young Canadian west. Under Nanton, the firm purchased land for building 'feeder' rail lines which they also financed and then acted as agents in selling them to the Canadian Pacific Railway. By 1900, the firm acted as agents for the sale of Galt Coal (founded by Nanton's father's former business partner) throughout the Canadian Prairies and, in the first year, sold 50,000 tons. Through this connection Nanton also became Managing Director of the Galt Alberta Railway (Galt Historic Railway Park) & Irrigation Company. In 1902, he concluded the sale of 800,000 acres in Saskatchewan, a deal worth several million dollars, solely on the basis of his personal handshake, testament to his solid reputation.Winnipeg, 1912. By Jim Blanchard By the early 20th century, Nanton was a director of about thirty corporations and associations. He took the greatest pride in sitting on the boards of the \\"World's Greatest Transportation Company\\", the Canadian Pacific Railway, and on the oldest commercial organization in the world, the Hudson's Bay Company. On the board of the CPR, he joined F. E. Meredith, with whom he shared the same uncle and godfather in Edmund Allen Meredith. Nanton was one of a small group of Winnipeg businessmen who directed the massive financing of and servicing for the influx of over a million settlers then pouring into the newly opened Canadian West. War service Kilmorie, Nanton's home in Winnipeg Within days of the outbreak of war, the Canadian Patriotic Fund was formed to help the dependants of those enlisting. Nanton became the President of the Manitoba Patriotic Fund (MPF), raising more, per capita, in the first year alone than any other Canadian Province. Of the $6 million raised by the MPF during the War, under Nanton only two per cent of that sum was used for administration costs and expenses.Canadian Patriotic Fund, 1914 to 1919. Official Publication, Ottawa. Nanton was known to get up in the night and personally drive wives and their children to hospitals to see their wounded husbands back from Europe. When the son of a Winnipeg family was lying severely wounded in a military hospital in England, Nanton anonymously arranged for a telegram to be sent each morning to the parents, reporting on their boy's condition. He was quite embarrassed when it was discovered he was responsible.Winnipeg, 1912. By Jim Blanchard In 1917, Nanton was among those who forwarded the campaign led by Sir Frederick Borden to raise conscription and lead the successful Victory Loan Campaigns. Nanton was Chairman of the Manitoba Victory Loan Committee and the only westerner on the Dominion Executive. He set up committees across the Canadian Prairies and Manitoba ended up raising $32 million in 1917, at an average of $71 per head over the national average of $58 per head, making Manitoba the talk of Victory Loan Headquarters in Toronto. Despite the 1918 flu pandemic coupled with atrocious Blizzards, the three Victory Loan campaigns saw increasing investment each year and in total Manitoba raised $120 million for the war effort, spirited by Nanton. During World War I, Nanton gave over half of his money to the war effort. He transformed the upstairs of his home, Kilmorie, and the ballroom was occupied for three days a week with women knitting and sewing tons of socks, sweaters and scarves, etc., to be shipped to the men of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles in France. Downstairs, Nanton opened his doors every night to an average of thirty men at one time from The Royal Regina Rifles while they were in training at Winnipeg. They were served sandwiches and cocoa, and were free to enjoy the use of the entertainments that he had provided for them which included two bowling alleys, a shooting gallery, use of his full-sized English billiard table, ping pong and tables for Bridge. In 1917, Sir Augustus and Lady Nanton converted their summer house on the Lake of the Woods into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers returning from Europe. They insisted that the staff be supplied from the Tuxedo Military Hospital, but that everything else was supplied by them. The 'Lady Nanton Convalescent Home' remained fully staffed for fifty soldiers until 1920, seeing 800 soldiers through its doors. Winnipeg General Strike A source of great personal sadness for Nanton was the Winnipeg General Strike that followed not even a year after peace in Europe was announced. Not only as the city's leading financier, but as President of Winnipeg Electric he was also the leading employer in Winnipeg. Despite all he had done to grow Winnipeg from its roots before the war and all his work to support Canadian soldiers ‚Äì particularly those from Manitoba ‚Äì during the war, he became a figure of contempt to many. Not only did the supporters of the Labour Party of Canada who had argued against Conscription turn against him, but also many of the soldiers who he had done so much to support rallied against him when they returned home to find their jobs had been taken by immigrants who had continued to come West during the war. Nanton joined with other business leaders to keep open the essential services to Winnipeg that the strikers had closed. At one mass meeting Nanton was physically attacked and a man cried out to the crowd to burn his house down. In consequence he sent his wife and daughters to sleep with friends while he and his staff took turns to patrol the grounds of Kilmorie during the night. No attack was made at Kilmorie, but the barn on his farm at Rosser was purposefully burned to the ground and twenty of his horses were killed. In 1923, Nanton was asked to Chair the non-profit Canada Colonization Association. Still exhausted from his exertions during the war, Nanton wanted to decrease his responsibilities but he accepted the position anyway, seen as the only man who could pull the committee together, a proof of his enduring reputation. Return to Toronto and Death Sir Edmund Osler, the man who had recognised Nanton's talents from the very start and nurtured him throughout his business career, died in August 1924. Though kept unknown to those around him, Nanton knew he was a sick man. Nanton was unanimously elected as Osler's successor, and never one to shirk duty, Nanton accepted. The Nantons were reluctant to leave Winnipeg, their home of over four decades. Lady Nanton was presented with a letter of appreciation signed by the 'Women of Winnipeg', forty one pages in all. The Nantons returned to his native Toronto later that year and took up office as President of the Dominion Bank and Senior partner of Osler, Hammond & Nanton. He struggled through the bank's annual meeting in January 1925, calling for greater communication and collaboration between eastern and western Canada, but it was the last duty he would perform. Nanton briefly returned to Winnipeg to attend the Board of Trade dinner in his honour. The final speaker, his friend George Allan, the first man he had met on arriving in Winnipeg in 1883, gave this outline of his contribution to the Canadian West: When Nanton's death was announced every flagpole visible in Winnipeg carried a flag at half mast and office buildings across Canada followed suit. The CPR supplied a special train to bring his remains, his family and business friends from Toronto to Winnipeg for the funeral service. A guard of honour of six hundred Winnipeg Electric employees lined the street leading from St. Luke's Church. His wife and children returned to their home at Kilmorie and continued to live there. Family In 1886, Nanton married his first wife, Georgina Hope Hespeler, daughter of The Hon. William Hespeler. She died the following year giving birth to their daughter, Mary Georgina, who went on to marry Douglas Lorn Cameron, son of Sir Douglas Cameron, 8th Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. He was married again in 1894, to Ethel Constance Clark of Winnipeg, and they had three sons, Edward, Augustus and Paul and two daughters, Constance and Marguerite Meredith Nanton, married Malcolm Trustram Eve, 1st Baron Silsoe. In 1900, Nanton built his home, 'Kilmorie', then outside Winnipeg, on the Assiniboine River. However, representing its rapid growth, by 1912 the house was enveloped by the city and has since been demolished. The house had a gatelodge (which still stands today) and large stables for Nanton's beloved horses. Between 1919 and 1924, the Nantons hosted dinner parties and balls on three separate occasions for the future King Edward VIII. ReferencesFurther reading * * A.M.

State of Iowa, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 660 (1849), is a 9-to-0 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the Sullivan Line of 1816 was the accepted boundary between the states of Iowa and Missouri. The ruling resolved a long-standing border dispute between the two states, which had nearly erupted in military clashes during the so-called \\"Honey War\\" of 1839. Background In 1808, the Osage Nation ceded all land east of Fort Clark (in what is now west-central Missouri) and north of the Arkansas River to the United States in what became known as the Treaty of Fort Clark.Monette, History of the Discovery and Settlement of the Valley of the Mississippi..., 1846, p. 547. In the wake of the War of 1812, the United States concluded the Treaties of Portage des Sioux, a series of treaties with Native American tribes which (among many other things) further defined the boundaries of the Osage Nation.Burns, A History of the Osage People, 1989, p. 295; Rodriguez, The Louisiana Purchase: A Historical and Geographical Encyclopedia, 2002, p. 285. Colonel John C. Sullivan was appointed to survey the territory and mark the northern boundary line, which became known as the Sullivan Line.Goodspeed, The Province and the States, 1904, p. 442-443. However, although the treaty specified a boundary which ran due east, the Sullivan Line tended north slightly and was irregular rather than straight.Conard, Encyclopedia of the History of Missouri: A Compendium of History and Biography for Ready Reference, 1901, p. 339. The admission of the Missouri Territory as a state to the United States was a highly contentious political issue in the United States, as it was caught up in the issue of slavery. Under the Missouri Compromise of 1820, the state was finally admitted into union. The United States Congress wrestled at length over what the new state's boundaries should be, and in the Act of March 6, 1820, Congress established the northern boundary of the state as follows:Shoemaker, Missouri's Struggle for Statehood, 1804-1821, 1916, p. 66-68. :Beginning in the middle of the Mississippi River, on the parallel of thirty-six degrees of north latitude; thence west along the said parallel of latitude to the St. Francois River; thence up and following the course of that river, in the middle of the main channel thereof, to the parallel of latitude of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes; thence west along the same to a point where the said parallel is intersected by a meridian line passing through the middle of the mouth of the Kansas River, where the same empties into the Missouri River; thence, from the point aforesaid, north along the said meridian line, to the intersection of the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the River Des Moines, making said line correspond with the Indian boundary- line; thence east from the point of intersection last aforesaid, along the said parallel of latitude, to the middle of the channel of the main fork of the said River Des Moines; thence down along the middle of the main channel of the said River Des Moines to the mouth of the same, where it empties into the Mississippi River; thence due east to the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi River; thence down and following the course of the Mississippi River, in the middle of the main channel thereof, to the place of beginning. The citizens of Missouri established the same boundaries in their state constitution of 1820. After another series of intense congressional debates and parliamentary maneuvers, Congress passed legislation approving Missouri's statehood on February 28, 1821, and the President of the United States signed the bill on March 2.Shoemaker, Missouri's Struggle for Statehood, 1804-1821, 1916, p. 300-301. With the state of Missouri carved out of the Missouri Territory, the Missouri Territory was left unorganized territory.\\"The Chain of Title to Iowa,\\" Annals of Iowa, July 1893, p. 137. In June 1834, the boundaries of the Michigan Territory were expanded to incorporate what remained of the old Missouri Territory.Santer, Michigan, Heart of the Great Lakes, 1977, p. 47. Just two years later, Congress split the current state of Michigan from the Michigan Territory in preparation for Michigan's entry into statehood, and renamed the territory the Wisconsin Territory. In June 1838, Congress split the Wisconsin Territory in two: What would become the modern state of Wisconsin remained the Wisconsin Territory, while the remainder of the territory was now called the Iowa Territory.Gue, History of Iowa From the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the Twentieth Century, 1903, p. 185-186. The modern state of Iowa was created on December 28, 1846 (with the remaining territory becoming unorganized again until the creation of the Minnesota Territory on March 3, 1849). Missouri surveyed its northern boundary in 1837. Joseph C. Brown surveyed the boundary according to the description found in the Missouri State Constitution of 1820, which said the northern border of the state began at rapids on the Des Moines River. Brown found a set of small rapids near present-day Keosauqua, Iowa, and ran the border due west from that point.Stock, Amazing Iowa, 2003, p. 24. In 1838, the Missouri Legislature passed a law declaring this line its northern boundary, essentially seizing nearly of land from the Iowa Territory. This territory was agriculturally valuable, and was especially well known for its honey production. In late 1839, the sheriff of Van Buren County, Iowa, arrested the sheriff of Clark County, Missouri, after the latter twice attempted to collect taxes on Iowans living north of the Sullivan Line.McCandless and Parrish, A History of Missouri: 1820 to 1860, 2000, p. 112.Erickson and Stuhr, Iowa, 2007, p. 92. Three honey trees were chopped down and taken into Missouri, and both states called out the state militia in what became known as the \\"Honey War\\" before cooler heads prevailed and both Iowa and Missouri agreed to submit the dispute to the U.S. Supreme Court (which, under the Constitution, had original jurisdiction over the issue).Stock, Amazing Iowa, 2003, p. 24-25; McCandless and Parrish, A History of Missouri: 1820 to 1860, 2000, p. 114. The two states petitioned the Supreme Court for redress in 1847.State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 666. Decision Map depicting the border claims made by Iowa and Missouri, and the Sullivan Line. Associate Justice John Catron delivered the unanimous opinion of the court. The state of Missouri alleged that the true border should begin at the \\"rapids of the Des Moines River,\\" rapids actually on the Des Moines River which were about north of the Sullivan Line.State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 662-663. The state of Iowa claimed that the rapids in question were the \\"rapids of the Des Moines River,\\" which in fact were actually rapids in the Mississippi River and the starting point of the Sullivan Line. Justice Catron reviewed at length the facts which created the boundary dispute.State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 667-670. Although he admitted that the Sullivan Line was \\"not a precisely true\\" line nor specific to the description contained in the Fort Clark and Portage des Sioux treaties, Justice Sullivan proposed investigating to what degree the federal government had respected the Sullivan Line.State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 670. He noted that the federal government had signed more than 15 treaties with various Indian tribes, all of which recognized the Sullivan Line as the northern border of Missouri.State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 670-672. Second, he proposed to discover how federal agencies had respected the Sullivan Line.State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 672. Catron noted that territorial governments and federal land agencies had all used the Sullivan Line as the Missouri boundary, and that land sales agents in Missouri and the various territories had been equally respectful of the line as the state's border.State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 672-673. Third, Catron noted that the United States had respected the Sullivan Line in establishing the borders of the various territories north of Missouri.State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 673. Justice Catron next attempted to construct the phrase \\"rapids of the Des Moines River\\" in an attempt to locate these rapids, as called for in federal legislation granting Missouri statehood and in the Missouri State Constitution of 1820. Iowa had claimed that the \\"Des Moines rapids\\" on the Mississippi River were the rapids referred to. But Justice Catron expressed deep scepticism of this claim:State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 674. :The name given in the act of Congress, taken in connection with its context, would assuredly apply to a rapid in the Des Moines River, if a notorious one existed, as the Mississippi River is not mentioned in the call, and the Des Moines is; nor was the Mississippi River to be reached by that line. Then, again, the rapid is fourteen miles long, and no part of it is called for as an opposite point to found the line upon. :It therefore follows that the claim of Iowa to come south to the middle of the rapid throws us on a doubtful and forced construction of the instrument under consideration; and such a construction we are not willing to adopt, even if Iowa could at this day set up a claim to its adoption, which, for the reasons above stated, we think she cannot be allowed to do. Catron next reviewed Missouri's attempt to locate a rapids on the Des Moines River. In reviewing Brown's attempts to locate such a rapids, Justice Catron noted that Brown encountered ripples, falls, and shoals, but no rapids.State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 674-676. None of these constituted a \\"notorious rapid...by public reputation\\", and thus Missouri's claim could not be supported either.State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 676. Catron then turned the Court's attention to the Missouri constitution, which also mentioned the Sullivan Line. The problem, as both Missouri and Iowa had pointed out, was that the Sullivan Line did not extend far enough west to meet with the western border of Missouri. Catron dismissed this issue. With almost no discussion, he concluded: \\"This Court is, then, driven to that call in the Constitution of Missouri which declares that her western boundary shall correspond with the Indian boundary line, and treating the western line of a hundred miles long as a unit and then running east from its northern terminus, it will supply the deficiency of a call for an object that never existed.\\"State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 677. Catron held that the proper border was the 1816 Sullivan Line. In an extensive decree, the Court described the Sullivan Line, ordered a commission (composed of a surveyor from Iowa and a surveyor from Missouri) to survey and mark the line, and empowered Chief Justice Taney to enforce the decree or appoint commissioners (in the event of death, disability, or refusal to act).State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660, 677-681. Outcomes The boundary commission surveyed and marked the border, and the Supreme Court issued orders and decrees in State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 51 U.S. 1 (1850), acknowledging their work and establishing the boundary thereby. However, by 1895, a portion of the boundary had been disturbed (by natural or man-made causes was unclear), and the boundary markers removed. To resolve the new dispute, Iowa and Missouri jointly filed suit and asked the Supreme Court to once more intervene. In State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 160 U.S. 688 (1896), the Court again established a commission (this time, adding a surveyor from the state of Illinois as well) to resurvey and remark the missing boundary line. The Court received the report of the second boundary commission, reviewed it at length, and accepted it as the true boundary in State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 165 U.S. 118 (1897).

The divestiture‚Äîthe first of its kind since 1990‚Äîwas ordered by the US Treasury Department, which chairs the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment.Banerjee, Neela, and Don Lee, \\"Obama blocks Chinese firm's Oregon wind farm projects\\", LA Times, September 29, 2012.

Tamra-Tacoma Capital Partners and Sany soon after announced plans to construct 1 gigawatt of wind infrastructure in the United States. The Huerafano acquisition marked Sany's first partnership with a U.S. mainland investment firm. Tamra-Tacoma Capital Partners initiated litigation against Sany America on August 31, 2016 alleging Sany fraudulently misrepresented the plant's production and had no maintenance program, leaving the asset \\"worthless\\" according to the complaint.

Its building, at the intersection of Bracka, Widok, Krucza, and Aleje Jerozolimskie, was built from 1948 to 1952, and was designed by Zbigniew Ihnatowicz and Jerzy Roma≈Ñski. The building was designed in the late Modernist style, while the majority of new projects being built in Warsaw at the time were constructed in the politically-favourable socialist realist style. The modernist design of Smyk made it a unique building at the time, yet also a very controversial one. Stalin believed that modernism was the architecture of capitalism and particularly disliked it as the favoured style in the decades just before the Second World War and thus its association with the Second Polish Republic. Unlike much of Warsaw's immediate pre-war architecture, the building is simple and functional, using no excess motifs or decorations to enhance its contemporary appearance. The current owner of the building is the \\"Centre for Development & Investments - Poland Sp. Zoo\\" Architecture The CDT 'Smyk' building on Aleje Jerozolimskie The building was designed in the popular pre-war 1920s style of modernism. Built as a detached structure formed from three separate blocks, the first, main, block forms the core of the store itself, with the main fa√ßade of the building fronting Aleje Jerozolimskie, the second construction operates as a food hall, whilst the third became a small office building attached to the rear of the main store via the restaurant section at ground floor. The main store was previously famous for its high-modernist windows, which were constructed using Polish oak frames and glass panes with an anti-reflective coating - a first for post-war era Polish architecture. The south elevation's main fa√ßade was specially designed to carry advertising and for most of its history was adorned with the store's trademark neon lights, arranged in the shape of spirals and supplemented with the vertically stacked letters \\"CDT\\", which stood for the store's original name 'Centralny Dom Towarowy' Central Department Store. Inside the building, communication between floors was ensured with the construction of 6 main escalators and 4 elevators within a central stairwell, these were further supplemented by a multitude of other minor escalators and stairways; this made CDT the second building in Warsaw to use moving-stairway technology. The building has two major emergency exits which lead directly down to Bracka and Krucza streets. The lobby of the store was originally decorated with terracotta wall tiling and oak flooring whilst the basement floor utilised reinforced concrete with glass and steel fittings; the use of these materials was then expanded to outfit the whole store. In addition to the standard fittings, a number of special pieces of art were commissioned for the interiors of the store, these included both sculpture and paintings, although they were usually of a distinctly modernist or post- modernist style. Major fire of 1975 On Sunday, 21 September 1975, starting at sometime between 7 and 8 pm the Central Department Store caught fire. The fire initially struck the 6th floor, feeding on rich wall coverings, carpets and fabrics there. During the fire, pieces of the ceiling began to fall, and largely as a result of this, as well as the large number of escalators, the fire spread to another three floors of the building. Around 8.30 pm there was a large explosion which left a large amount of glass and other debris strewn across Krucza street and the Aleje Jerozolimskie. Around 10 pm the entire building has been thoroughly burnt out and as the fire began reach plastic consumer goods, the flames provided a spectacular sight by turning light blue, purple and pink. The Warsaw fire service finally managed to bring the fire under control and subsequently extinguish it shortly after midnight; and whilst the majority of the store was completely destroyed, the main concrete construction of the CDT fortunately survived. The cause of the fire was later assumed to have been caused by a faulty escalator motor which had malfunctioned, and then burnt out. Afterwards, the state authorities decided to renovate the CDT. However, with the fire having completely destroyed the original interior and all its furnishings, the government believed that it would be too costly to replace everything in the hard economic times of the 1970s and so instead embarked upon a complete reconstruction of the building which changed much of its original appearance and never allowed it to regain its former glory. During the reconstruction most of the distinctive furniture as well as the whole of the glass fa√ßade were replaced with newer, less costly materials. Fate and future of the Central Department Store In the 80s the former \\"CDT\\", by now renamed \\"Smyk\\", became a member of the 'Central Department Stores' group. In 2000, the 'Smyk' chain was separated from the company's department stores line and re-established as 'Smyk Sp. Zoo', a branded chain of stores with products for children. This separate line of children's stores has outlived its parent company and survives to this day. The current owner, 'CDI Smykowi', however, wants to restore the flagship Warsaw store to its former glory and re-open it as a full service department store, as was originally intended. After the planned renovation, the building will look exactly as was imagined by its creators. The CDT will recover many of its original features, including its original rich facade with vertical and horizontal dividing lines and window frames of Polish oak. To the rear, it is proposed to build a new extension which will replace the original second and third blocks, which are of no real architectural merit and do not have listed building status. Perhaps most importantly, it is expected that the famous neon spirals and 'CDT' titles will again be affixed to the building's fa√ßade, and that the revitalised store will operate under its original three letter acronym. The redevelopment project was prepared by Andrzej Cho≈Çdzy≈Ñski and Wojciech Grabianowski.

The creature is described as a seven-foot tall, blue-eyed, or amber-eyed bipedal canine-like animal with the torso of a man and a fearsome howl that sounds like a human scream. According to legends, the Michigan Dogman appears in a ten-year cycle that falls on years ending in 7. Sightings have been reported in several locations throughout Michigan, primarily in the northwestern quadrant of the Lower Peninsula. In 1987, the legend of the Michigan Dogman gained popularity when disc jockey Steve Cook at WTCM-FM recorded a song about the creature and its reported sightings.  History  This creature was unknown to most of the modern world until very late in the twentieth century. It is said to have been stalking the area around the Manistee River since the days when the Odawa tribes lived there. Authentic sources for sightings made prior to 1987, however, have never been documented beyond Steve Cook's song, discussed below. The first alleged encounter of the Michigan Dogman occurred in 1887 in Wexford County, when two lumberjacks saw a creature which they described as having a man's body and a dog's head. In 1937 in Paris, Michigan, Robert Fortney was attacked by five wild dogs and said that one of the five walked on two legs.Godfrey, pp. 60-61 Reports of similar creatures also came from Allegan County in the 1950s, and in Manistee and Cross Village in 1967. Linda S. Godfrey, in her book The Beast of Bray Road, compares the Manistee sightings to a similar creature sighted in Wisconsin known as the Beast of Bray Road.Godfrey, pp. 62-63  The Cook song  In 1987 disc jockey Steve Cook at WTCM-FM in Traverse City, Michigan recorded a song titled \\"The Legend\\", which he initially played as an April Fool's Day joke. He based the songs on myths and legends from around North America, and had never heard of an actual Michigan \\"dogman\\" at the time of the recording: Cook maintains his skepticism about the possibility of a real dogman, he had this to say about the matter: Cook recorded the song with a keyboard backing and credited it to Bob Farley. After he played the song, Cook received calls from listeners who said that they had encountered a similar creature. In the next weeks after Cook first played the song, it was the most- requested song on the station. He also sold cassettes of the songs for four dollars, and donated proceeds from the single to an animal shelter.Godfrey, pp. 61-62 Over the years, Cook has received more than 100 reports of the creature's existence. In March 2010, the creature was featured in an episode of MonsterQuest. In January 2017, the creature was featured in the season 2 episode \\"Great Lakes: Wolfman, Dogman, Wendigo\\" of Monsters and Mysteries in America. Other references to Dogman include various Youtube channels including Dogman Encounters Radio and Dogman Narratives. Cook later added verses to the song in 1997 after hearing a report of an animal break-in by an unknown canine at a cabin in Luther, Michigan. He re-recorded it again in 2007, with a mandolin backing.  Feature film  In late 2011, filmmaker Rich Brauer released a film called Dogman, starring Larry Joe Campbell. The movie premiered at the State Theater in Traverse City. The film included a brief segment of \\"The Gable Film\\", used with permission from Mike Agrusa, who received acknowledgement in the film credits.

Life  He was born in Breslau, the son of a Breslau pharmacist with the same name. After a classical education at the Elisabeth school in Breslau, Scholz attended the University of Wittenberg from 1572 to 1576. There and in Padua and Bologna, cities with well-established botanical gardens, he studied medicine and other sciences. In 1579 he undertook an educational grand tour of Italy with his countrymen Niklas von Rhediger, Johann Matth√§us Wacker von Wackenfels und Martin Schilling. He and Schilling separated from the group in Milan and traveled to southern France, where he took his doctorate at the University of Valence. In 1580 he was back in Breslau where he remained permanently from 1585 until his death. He previously practised medicine in Schwiebus and Freystadt in Silesia. After returning to Silesia, Scholz married Sara Aurifaber, the daughter of a Breslau pastor. He worked intensively in research on the plague and wrote a Pestordnung, printed 1581 in Breslau. In 1585 Johannes Crato von Krafftheim bestowed a coat of arms on Scholz in Crato‚Äôs capacity as an imperial count palatine. In recognition of his successful efforts against the plague, he was elevated to the Bohemian peerage with the title \\"Scholz von Rosenau\\" in 1596. Scholz succumbed to tuberculosis 1599. He became famous through the translation and publication of writings of famous Greek and Arab medical writers, as well as contemporary physicians. To these contributions he added his own Aphorismorum medicinalium cum theoreticorum tum practicorum sectiones VIII of 1589, a reference work of the collected medical knowledge of his age. As a botanist, Scholz was particularly interested the newly introduced exotic plants from Asia and Americas, which he cultivated from 1587 in prodigious quantities in his garden in Breslau. He commissioned the Breslau painter Georg Freyberger to produce an illustrated catalog; he wrote two plant inventories, which were printed in 1587 and 1594 in Breslau. Scholz's garden covered an area of about three hectares and was divided into four quadrants by a central pathway. In the middle of the garden was a building that served as an art gallery and dining room. Here he organized cheerful flower festivals to which he invited selected individuals. He also cultivated potatoes in his garden. Works * Aphorismorum Medicinalium ... Breslau: Per Haeredes Iohannis Scharffenbergij, 1589 (VD 16 S 3823). * Catalogus arborum, fruticum et plantarum.

Browning in 1919, patented on 1 August 1922 and manufactured by Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal Belgium from 1922 to 1974. Models manufactured post 1969 had a product code W. The rifle has a .22 caliber chamber, a tubular 11-round magazine, 24-inch round barrel, wooden semi-pistol grip stock. Models made in the late 1960s featured a dovetail notch for mounting scopes. The stocks of early models were susceptible to cracking, sometimes attributed to the shape of the receiver; later models, such as the dovetail scope variant, appeared to solve this problem. The pump grip of all models is susceptible to cracking, the wood between the magazine and barrel being especially thin, this rarely detected unless the rifle is disassembled. Although the rifle was never commercially imported into the United States, many have made their way there by way of returning service members, small lots, and other various means.

These are used to fill either a bottle or a pouch, depending on the product. There are several types of fillers used by the packaging industry. The following are the most common: *Auger/agitator fillers: designed to fill dry mixes, such as flour and sugar. The fillers have a hopper shaped like a cone that holds the mix and puts it in a pouch using an auger conveyor that is controlled by the agitator. The mix is filled in a pouch that is made of paper or poly that is formed in a collar and the pouch gets sealed by a series of heaters and dies.

Every weighing-hopper is designed to handle the unique needs of precise weights. *Flow fillers: designed for liquids, oils, and thin food products. These fillers are designed when they fill a bottle or tub that enters the machine, the ejects the open bottle back onto another conveyor for sealing. *Tablet fillers: These are designed for products that are counted by pieces instead of weight. These are designed for small bottles (similar to some of the flow fillers), but the hopper of the filler is set up to permit scan counting of tablets or candy pieces. *Positive displacement pump fillers: positive displacement, pump filling machines easily handle a wide range of container sizes, fill volumes and product types. While originally designed for filling creams, gels and lotions these fillers also handle water thin and heavy paste products. Some of the products this machine easily fills are cosmetic creams, heavy sauces, thick shampoo and hair conditioners, honey, hair gels, paste cleaners, and car wax. *Tube filling machinery: Tubes usually have viscous products and require special filling equipment. *Vertical form fill sealing machine See also *Check weigher *Multihead weigher *Quality assurance *Validation and verification References * Soroka, W, \\"Fundamentals of Packaging Technology\\", IoPP, 2002, * Yam, K.

History and theoretical framework  The history of the concept of the learning society can be traced through the chronological development of its theoretical framework. As the framework has developed overtime, so has the sophistication of the idea of the learning society as it applies to an inter-connected 21st-century model, particularly in relation to the shift from state-based educational institutions to more decentralised organisations. In 1973, Donald Sch√∂nSch√∂n, D. A. (1973). ‚ÄúBeyond the Stable State. Public and private learning in a changing society.‚Äù Harmondsworth: Penguin. developed the idea that change is constant in a modern state (‚Äòloss of the stable state‚Äô) and thus to adapt to this change, there must be a constant state of learning within the society of that state. Further, Robert Maynard HutchinsHutchins, R. M. (1970). ‚ÄúThe Learning Society‚Äù. Harmondsworth: Penguin. also argued that given the ever-changing nature of states, particularly in business organisations, it wasn‚Äôt possible for educational institutions to keep up, or even be expected to. Later, Torsten Hus√©nHus√©n, T. (1986). ‚ÄúThe Learning Society Revisited.‚Äù Oxford: Pergamon. and Stewart RansonRanson, S. (1998). ‚ÄúInside the Learning Society.‚Äù London: Cassell. emphasise that learning has a certain ‚Äòfluidity‚Äô (with no start or end points) that exists outside of formal systems and this seems to reflect a liberalised market model of free movements of knowledge as required by organisations and systems. Developing this framework to a more contemporary basis, it is seen that the requirement for a ‚Äòlearning society‚Äô is a response to the broader issues of globalisation whereby richer countries have then become increasingly dependent on ‚Äúknowledge workers‚Äù rather than traditional manufacturing industries (now often outsourced to developing nations), and thus need their workforces to become adaptable, particularly in light of new technological developments which are seen as central to the knowledge economy.Jarvis, P. (2000). ‚ÄúGlobalisation, the learning society and comparative education.‚Äù Comparative Education , 36 (3), 343-355. With this model the concept of the learning society will be transplanted to other countries globally, much like any other product on a global market. This is in keeping with the philosophy of the World Bank that learning and education is central to improved development, justice, the environment and eradication of poverty (and thus global terror threats).  Relationship to lifelong learning  A learning society is generally considered to be the basis from which lifelong learning can take place. From a theoretical standpoint, not only does the learning society provide the framework in which lifelong learning is allowed to flourish, but that in fact both elements mutually support each other. That is, a learning society gives rise to the capacity for lifelong learning, but lifelong learning allows, through socialisation, for individuals to contribute back to the learning abilities of broader society in the form of wisdom (known as a ‚Äòkoinosophic‚Äô or ‚Äòwise‚Äô society).  Elements of learning societies  While the notion of the learning society can be sometimes difficult to grasp (relying as it does on concepts such as ‚Äòfluidity‚Äô and ‚Äòinformality‚Äô, and moving outside of traditional educative boundaries such as schools & universities), some scholars believe that a learning society can be identified as having 4 main attributes. These are:  Futuristic  This is described as the tendency of the learning society to have a dependency on technological advances. This can be regarded as the shifts towards knowledge economies in developed countries where the concept of the learning society is most prevalent, but also vitally as acknowledging the importance of the internet in allowing education to move beyond traditional boundaries and move across transnational borders instantly.  Societal  This attribute is part of the broader conscious acknowledgement that is made by states and institutions that lifelong learning (as part of the learning society) exists specifically to contribute to the economic growth of a country and increase the democratic engagement of its citizens. Rather than being a general global shift towards an educational trend, it is aims towards specific outcomes that societies consider to be for their betterment.  Reflexive  This attribute requires learning societies to recognise not just the role of lifelong learning within the broader community, but also to enable it to be adaptable to changes, and flexible to specific individual needs. These changes may come about as a result of technological advances, legislative amendments or personal preferences of the individual undertaking the education. According to Jarvis: (italics)(indent) ‚Äú...education will be but one more provider of information in the learning market and the educational qualification will become the public recognition of a private process.‚Äù (normal)(no indent) Thus, it will be the awareness of an individual‚Äôs ability to learn that will be of value, rather than what that individual has learned in the past.  Global market  The final attribute of a learning society requires that, like many products on a global market, education becomes a commodity and that students or participants in the learning process become consumers, able to pick and choose the types of education that they would like, to suit their own personal preferences. This would be facilitated through technological advances that allow students to access learning resources (and qualifications) globally. Under this attribute, education would then become tailored towards providing ‚Äúcustomer satisfaction‚Äù to become economically justifiable.  Current models of learning societies today = Australia and UK  One of the most prevalent examples is the model of the Open Universities, common in the UK and Australia. They allow students to work towards qualifications accredited by existing higher educational institutions but ‚Äòcherry-pick‚Äô the courses they have a preference for, while at the same time conducting their learning online. This is best typified by a testimonial found on the Open Universities Australia website: :‚ÄúStudying through OUA is very rewarding, particularly if you are a motivated and patient person. It also offers the flexibility that you simply can‚Äôt get with a brick-and-mortar university, which is definitely beneficial for some.\\" ‚Äì Open Universities Australia testimonialOpen Universities Australia.

Based very much in the ‚Äúworld education culture‚Äù model‚Äù, learning societies are seen as being central to competitive knowledge economy in a globalised world. Advocates of learning societies see traditional institutions as no longer being central to lifelong learning. For example, transnational corporations such as Cisco believe that it will not come about simply through building more schools and universities. These organisations also advocate for the role of lifelong learning within their own structures.  Debates regarding learning societies & higher education  Debates are argued addressing the role of how existing higher education institutions fit into the concept of the learning society. Despite the traditional argument that the learning society eschews traditional institutions, some advocates of the concept reaffirm the role of universities as being central to where the learning society begins and argue that ‚Äúthe university‚Äôs role in society is precisely to learn and understand itself and its environment...The more it addresses the concerns of society in its research, and the more it widens access to all members of society to benefit from the fruits of the research, the more it supports a genuine ‚Äòlearning society‚Äô‚Äù Laurillard, D.

In September 2010, newly elected Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard reflected the growing diversification of the education sector in her cabinet, by abandoning the role of a traditional ‚ÄòEducation Minister‚Äô and instead subsuming the role of higher education into a ministerial portfolio that also included jobs, skills and workplace relations ‚Äì this move was criticised by many high-profile universities in Australia who argued that it undermined the central role of higher education as a place for learning in society.Tomazin, F.

Further, advocates of the ‚ÄòLearning Society‚Äô also call upon partnerships between public and private enterprises to expand the scope of education to allow for more powerful educational learning experiences inside and outside of traditional institutions. These partnerships are seen to increase supplement funding levels (where inadequate public funds exists) as well as open traditional institutions and methods to technology and industry‚Äù. One criticism is that the learning society does not actually exist, but is simply a tool or theory invoked by powers (governments, IGO‚Äôs) to push certain agendas. This argument maintains that it is easy to see how the idea could be used to justify World Bank & OECD programs in developing countries Hughes, C., & Tight, M. (1995). ‚ÄúThe Myth of the Learning Society‚Äù. British Journal of Education Studies , 43 (3), 290-304. Or rather that it is nothing more than a vague term to describe an unfocused notion of 'learning on the internet' It is often difficult to find, despite the prevalence of the term ‚Äòlearning society‚Äô amongst policy makers and politicians, information of real strategic funding from governments or corporations that reflect the theories and approaches of the learning society.Prof. Sackett, P. D. (2010, March 18). Preparing A Learning Society For The Future. Retrieved October 2, 2010, from Chief Scientist for Australia: http://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/wp- content/uploads/100318-CSMR-PMSEIC-final-Media-Release.pdf With regard to questions being asked of the concept of the learning society, beyond ‚Äòon-the- job‚Äô training corporations may speak of the value of learning, but could it simply be another term for ‚Äòflexibility‚Äô on the part of employees? Is the term simply a term used to define current (yet inevitable) changes in education technology in an increasingly connected world? In the case of China's proposed improvements to their education system, it could be argued that much of the reforms are simply a timeline of general educational upgrades, rather than adhering to any particular philosophy unique to a 'learning society'. Further, a lack of specificity can exist in much of the literature surrounding the learning society. For example, the Cisco white paper speaks of: :\\"...21st Century skills like collaboration, problem-solving and creativity...\\" but how these particular skills are unique to the idea of a learning society (as opposed to learning generally) is not clear. Further, there is criticism that standardisation of assessment and credentialing ignores the cultural differences between global communities, and thus erodes important distinctions that may allow learning and education to be effectively embedded in those cultures‚Äù.

The college was formed in 1919 after first being a private high school and then a college under a different name. At the time, having a college for women was a new idea but one of the reasons the college closed in the 1920s was due to the old-fashioned rules and regulations that were enforced. Other names for the school included the Sherman Male and Female High School and the North Texas Female College. The Mary Nash College sold their campus to Kidd-Key College in 1901.  History  In the 1860s, the Sherman Male and Female High School was opened in rented space in the Odd Fellows Hall.Handbook of Texas Online (accessed September 24, 2010) The trustees bought some land and a two-story building was constructed to house the new school. In 1877, the State made a contract with the North Texas Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, which changed the high school into the North Texas Female College and the males who used to attend the high school attended other schools. The purpose of the school was for ‚Äúthe support of a female college, a school of fine arts, and a conservatory of music‚Äù.Kidd-Key College and Conservatory records, DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University. Series 1, Box 1, Folder 1. Lucy Ann Thornton Kidd, a widowed teacher from Mississippi, was selected to be the president of the College, becoming Lucy Ann Kidd-Key after marrying Bishop Joseph S. Key in 1892. During Kidd-Key's time as president of the college, the rules were very strict and emphasized the arts while Kidd-Key focused on maintaining the virtue of the women who attended her school.Kidd-Key College and Conservatory records, DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University. Series 1, Box 2, Folder 33. They were only allowed visitors on certain days and at certain times, chaperoned walks, and all students were required to attend church every Sunday. In 1912, the college gained membership into the Founders Club of Southern Methodist University.Kidd-Key College and Conservatory records, DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University. Series 1, Box 1, Folder 3. They had correspondence with SMU and had a genial relationship with them. The president of Kidd-Key College even offered SMU some advice and gave them some pointers on what to expect as a new school. However, the opening of Southern Methodist University in 1915 resulted in a decline of funding from the North Texas Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The enrollment rate began to decline with the loss of funding as well as fewer students being drawn in by the strict rules and regulations in place at the college. Kidd-Key died in 1916 and her son, Edwin Kidd, took her place as president of the college. In 1919, the name of the college was changed to Kidd-Key College and Conservatory. Due to the decline in enrollment, Edwin Kidd coordinated with the president of Austin College to share facilities and programs. The curriculum at Kidd-Key College was also reduced to a few choice classes to try to preserve the college as much as possible. These efforts worked temporarily, but the campus was eventually closed and liquidated. In 1933, the North Texas Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church gave full backing to Southern Methodist University and no longer wished to support Kidd-Key College.Domatti, Ruth O. \\"A History of Kidd-Key College.\\" The Southwestern Historical Quarterly 63.2 (1959): 263-78.

Each organisation is independent, but SEA provides a national voice to promote and support Steiner education in Australia.  Origins and History = Foundations  The growth of the Waldorf movement in the Australian context originated from the influence of key members involved with the Anthroposophical Society of Australia. In the 1920-40s, networking and contacting from members within the Anthroposophical Society brought about growth and interest in the implementation of Waldorf philosophy into the Australian context. Early members of the Society were involved in small grassroots movements that were passed onto other individuals through word of mouth, who shared their interests and enthusiasm of Rudolf Steiner values with each other. The first Steiner education school that was established in Australia was the Glenaeon Rudolf Steiner School in 1957 in the Sydney suburb of Castlecrag. Steiner Education Australia Steiner Schools have been operating in Australia for more than 60 years and are growing in popularity locally and globally. In Australia, 17 new schools opened in the last decade, and Steiner-based streams have been being introduced to several state schools in South Australia and Victoria. There are more Steiner schools scheduled to open in 2020 and beyond. The surge in interest is expected to increase further with Gonski 2.0 placing great emphasis on critical and creative thinking, social skills and problem solving ‚Äì capabilities which the Steiner philosophy has long since cultivated. To uphold the pedagogy of Steiner education, Steiner Education Australia has developed the Australian Steiner Curriculum Framework (ASCF). The ASCF is recognised by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) as meeting the requirements of ACARA‚Äôs Australian Curriculum. This includes providing for students to learn the curriculum content and achieve standards described in Australian Curriculum documents.

Carbohydrates are used by cells for a wide range of functions from structural purposes to extracellular communication. Carbohydrates are suitable for such a wide variety of functions due to the diversity in structure generated from monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkage positions, chain branching, and covalent modification. Possible covalent modifications include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation. Sulfation, performed by carbohydrate sulfotransferases, generates carbohydrate sulfate esters. These sulfate esters are only located extracellularly, whether through excretion into the extracellular matrix (ECM) or by presentation on the cell surface. As extracellular compounds, sulfated carbohydrates are mediators of intercellular communication, cellular adhesion, and ECM maintenance. Enzyme mechanism Sulfotransferases catalyze the transfer of a sulfonyl group from an activated sulfate donor onto a hydroxyl group (or an amino group, although this is less common) of an acceptor molecule. In eukaryotic cells the activated sulfate donor is 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) (Figure 1). Figure 1: A general carbohydrate sulfotransferase reaction. PAPS is shown as the activated sulfate donor; PAPS is the sulfate donor in eukaryotic cells. PAPS is synthesized in the cytosol from ATP and sulfate through the sequential action of ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase. ATP sulfurylase first generates adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (APS) and then APS kinase transfers a phosphate from ATP to APS to create PAPS. The importance of PAPS and sulfation has been discerned in previous studies by using chlorate, an analogue of sulfate, as a competitive inhibitor of ATP sulfurylase. PAPS is a cosubstrate and source of activated sulfate for both cytosolic sulfotransferases and carbohydrate sulfotransferases, which are located in the Golgi. PAPS moves between the cytosol and the Golgi lumen via PAPS/PAP (3‚Äô-phosphoadenosine-5‚Äô-phosphate) translocase, a transmembrane antiporter. The exact mechanism used by sulfotransferases is still being elucidated, but studies have indicated that sulfotransferases use an in-line sulfonyl-transfer mechanism that is analogous to the phosphoryl transfer mechanism used by many kinases, which is logical given the great level of structural and functional similarities between kinases and sulfotransferases (Figure 2). In carbohydrate sulfotransferases a conserved lysine has been identified in the active PAPS binding site, which is analogous to a conserved lysine in the active ATP binding site of kinases. Protein sequence alignment studies indicate that this lysine is conserved in cytosolic sulfotransferases as well. In addition to the conserved lysine, sulfotransferases have a highly conserved histidine in the active site. Based on the conservation of these residues, theoretical models, and experimental measurements a theoretical transition state for catalyzed sulfation has been proposed (Figure 3). {style=\\"margin: auto auto;\\" Figure 2: The mechanism by which carbohydrate sulfotransferase catalyzes the transfer of a sulfonyl group to a carbohydrate group in a glycoprotein or glycolipid is analogous to the mechanism by which a kinase catalyzes a phosphoryl group. Both enzymes use a lysine residue in their active sites to coordinate to their cosubstrates; the ATP cosubstrate in the kinase mechanism is analogous to the PAPS in the carbohydrate sulfotransferase mechanism (green). Red shows the group being transferred; note that the transfer is coordinated around the lysine. Black is the substrate. Sia stands for sialic acid. Figure 3: Transition state for catalyzed sulfation as proposed by Chapman et al. 2004. Note the use of the conserved lysine and histidine residues. } Biological function Carbohydrate sulfotransferases are transmembrane enzymes in the Golgi that modify carbohydrates on glycolipids or glyoproteins as they move along the secretory pathway. They have a short cytoplasmic N-terminal, one transmembrane domain, and a large C-terminal Golgi luminal domain. They are distinct from cytosolic sulfotransferases in both structure and function. While cytosolic sulfotransferases play a metabolic role by modifying small molecule substrates such as steroids, flavonoids, neurotransmitters, and phenols, carbohydrate sulfotransferases have a fundamental role in extracellular signalling and adhesion by generating unique ligands through the modification of carbohydrate scaffolds. Since the substrates of carbohydrate sulfotransferases are larger, they have larger active sites than cytosolic sulfotransferases. There are two major families of carbohydrate sulfotransferases: heparan sulfotransferases and galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine/N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferases (GSTs).  Heparan Sulfotransferases  Heparan sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that is linked by xylose to serine residues of proteins such as perlecan, syndecan, or glypican. Sulfation of heparan sulfate GAGs helps give diversity to cell surface proteins and provides them with a unique sulfation pattern that allows them to specifically interact with other proteins. For example, in mast cells the AT-III-binding pentasaccharaide is synthesized with essential heparan sulfate sulfation steps. The binding of the heparan sulfate in this pentasaccharide to AT-III inactivates the blood- coagulation factors thrombin and Factor Xa. Heparan sulfates are also known to interact with growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, lipid and membrane binding proteins, and adhesion molecules.  GSTs  GSTs catalyze sulfation at the 6-hydroxyl group of galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, or N-acetylglucosamine. Like heparan sulfotransferases, GSTs are responsible for post-translational protein sulfation that assists in cell-signaling. GSTs are also responsible for the sulfation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that assist with maintaining the structure between cells For example, GSTs catalyze the sulfation of glycoproteins displaying the L-selectin binding epitope 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x, which recruits leukocytes to areas of chronic inflammation. GSTs are also responsible for the proper function of the ECM in the cornea; improper sulfation by GSTs can lead to opaque corneas.  Disease Relevance  Carbohydrate sulfotransferases are of great interest as drug targets because of their essential roles in cell-cell signalling, adhesion, and ECM maintenance. Their roles in blood coagulation, chronic inflammation, and cornea maintenance mentioned in the Biological Function section above are all of interest for potential therapeutic purposes. In addition to these roles, carbohydrate sulfotransferases are of pharmacological interest because of their roles in viral infection, including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Heparan sulfate sites have been shown to be essential for HSV-1 binding that leads to the virus entering the cell. In contrast, heparan sulfate complexes have been shown to bind to HIV-1 and prevent it from entering the cell through its intended target, the CD4 receptor.

The river has two left Lev√ßay. () and Aƒüdaban√ßay (), and one right Turaƒüay√ßay () tributaries. Sarsang reservoir was built on Tartar river in 1976 for electricity and irrigation purposes. Statistical information The overall length of the river is , the basin area is . Tartarchay is considered one of the water-rich tributaries of Kura within Azerbaijani territory. The water volumes are sourced from rainfall (14%), snow (28%) and underground waters (58%). During spring and summer months, the snow melting in the mountains causes floods making up 65-70% of the annual water flow. In August and September, the water levels decrease. From October until November, the rainfall increases the water levels again. The average annual discharge of the river is . Average annual flow is 693.8 million m3.

Before finding fame as a bicyclist, he worked in the New York area as an actor and writer. In recent years, he has returned to the entertainment industry as an actor, writer, and producer. Early life Foster was born in Waterbury, Connecticut to Joseph Adrian, an accountant, and Stella Lucia (n√©e Vicedomini), a homemaker. His siblings included a younger brother and two younger sisters. His heritage is English, Irish, and Welsh from his father's side, and Spanish, Italian, and Jewish from his mother. Foster was raised in a predominantly Italian household in the North End section of Waterbury, later living in several nearby towns. Foster's mother gave her children a strong religious background that began as Catholic (he was an altar boy) and then moved on to Lutheran and Episcopalian (where he sang in the children's choir).Marquis Who's Who.

In 1968, Foster received an electric shock from a live wire and fell approximately 30 feet. His memory was erased, and doctors told Foster's parents that he would never walk again. Foster did eventually regain some of his memory, although his memory of his friends, families, and relatives up to that point was gone. After four years of therapy, Foster was completely freed from his wheelchair. Foster credits the experience with changing his outlook on life, and leading him to dedicate himself as a Christian. In 1972, as he was first learning to ride a bicycle, Foster saw a news broadcast of U.S. President Richard Nixon meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong atop the Great Wall of China. The sight inspired Foster to bicycle along the Wall from one end to the other, although his letters to both world leaders asking for permission received only a polite brush off from the White House. Acting career Foster had begun to act at the age of three, appearing in church and school plays and community theatre. At the age of 16, he began appearing at Connecticut's Southbury Playhouse and other summer stock and dinner theater venues around Connecticut. In fall 1980, Foster entered the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. He later trained with Lee Strasberg at Actors Studio; Uta Hagen and Herbert Berghof at HB Studio; and with Stella Adler. He continued stage work in and around New York, working his way up from regional theatre, to \\"Shakespeare in the Park\\" with Joseph Papp, to off-Broadway, and finally to Broadway, where he appeared in the Vietnam drama, Go Home, Spec 5. He made his film debut in 1980 as an extra in Friday the 13th Part 2.Regan, Michael (Friday, 11 July 1987) Waterbury Cyclist Aims to Conquer Great Wall. The Hartford (Connecticut) Courant. During this time, he supplemented his income by giving fencing lessons and writing for various newspapers, as well as writing two unpublished novels and several plays.Taylor, Robyn (Saturday, 28 July 1990) Cyclist Attains Dream at Great Wall.

China tour plans and delays In 1985, Foster returned to his dream of cycling the Great Wall of China. His hopes were bolstered by finding that skateboarding was now allowed on the Wall. With the backing of National Geographic and U.S. Senator Chris Dodd, in 1987 Foster received permission from the Chinese government to attempt to become the first person to travel the Wall's 2000 miles by bicycle. Shortly after receiving permission, Foster was hit by a truck while bicycling, and had to cancel the tour. He attempted to revive the plan the next year, but had difficulty raising the necessary funds. In 1989, a week before Foster was to leave for China, the Tiananmen Square protests broke out. The tour was postponed once again, and several corporations dropped their sponsorship fearing a negative association from the massacre. World record conquest With time on his hands from the tour's cancellation, Foster broke the world record for traveling the length of the New York City Subway in October 1989, finishing in a time of 26 hours, 21 minutes, and 8 seconds.Adams, Robyn (Monday, 23 October 1989) This Subway Ride is 1 for the Books. The American. Waterbury, Connecticut.Adams, Robyn (Tuesday, 21 November 1989) \\"Great Subway Rider\\" Makes Record Book. The American. Waterbury, Connecticut. Great Wall of China tour A month after his world record conquest, Foster flew to China to begin preparations for a Great Wall tour the following spring. The Chinese government would allow Foster to cover some 2000 miles of the Great Wall from the furthest point west at Jiayuguan to the \\"First Gate Under Heaven\\" at Shanhaiguan in the east. In exchange, he would promote unity between the U.S. and China. The Chinese government hoped that this would bolster tourism, which had dropped to all- time lows since the events of Tiananmen Square. Foster began his ride on May 9, 1990, wearing a red, white and blue helmet and uniform and riding a newly developed mountain bike in the same design. As he made his first tire tracks in the wall, Foster commented, \\"Now I know how Neil Armstrong felt when he walked on the moon.\\"Foster's Official Website. www.kevin-foster.com Foster's Great Wall of China bicycle expedition lasted 50 days, during which he traveled 1,174.8 miles. He encountered challenges including sandstorms that at one point buried him; a crash that launched him through the Wall onto an ancient skeleton and broke three ribs; rain and hail storms, monsoons, and temperatures up to 130 degrees Fahrenheit. He traveled for 15‚Äì18 hours per day, covering 25‚Äì30 miles, and lost approximately 30 pounds over his three months in China. He and his five-man crew (who carried food and water in their Jeeps) would occasionally stay in a nearby town to refresh themselves.Liu, Zhuoye (10‚Äì16 September 1990) Great Wall Dream Comes True. Beijing Review. Vol 33, No 37. Due to military restrictions, Foster was not allowed to cycle the 1500 miles that made up the Wall's middle section, the area that bordered China from Inner Mongolia. He and his team would have to divert north to Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, and then south toward Beijing. Since he was forced to comply, Foster decided to make another adventure of it, receiving permission to race a pair of Mongolian horsemen for several hundred yards. The race was a photo finish with Foster winning by the width of his bike tire.Smutko, Liz. Cyclist of the Year. Bicycling Magazine, February 1991. In the Badaling section of the Wall just north of Beijing, Foster was so mobbed by press and tourists he had to walk his bicycle until the crowds thinned. It was also in this section that he was able to fulfill another dream by sleeping in the towers where the Wall's guards and their families had slept centuries earlier.Associated Press (Monday, 18 June 1990) Bicyclist Travels the Wall. Telegram & Gazette. Worcester, Massachusetts. Other sections that stood out for Foster were Mutianyu because it was like riding a roller coaster; Pankou, which Chairman Mao had flooded and the only way across was by row boat; and Simatai, which was so steep and narrow that one could only pass through it by crawling on their hands and knees. On June 29, 1990, Foster finished his tour at Shanhaiguan, where he was met by a hoard of tourists, media, hosts, and sponsors. He was also met by guards, who detained Foster and his crew for an hour of interrogation.Associated Press (Sunday, 1 July 1990) Cyclist Makes Closing Dash Along Great Wall. South China Sunday Morning Post. He earned the 1990 Cyclist of the Year award over his friend, Greg LeMond, who had won the Tour de France; the cycling industry dubbed Foster's journey as, \\"the last, greatest, cycling adventure on the face of the earth.\\" While Foster had initially planned to return to his acting career, he was convinced by his manager, Charlie Litsky, that he could do much better as an adventure cyclist than a starving artist. American Summits tour Following the Great Wall tour, Foster moved from Ojai, California, to the community of Kaweah, at the base of Sequoia National Park. As he was cycling in the mountains one day, he found a \\"no biking\\" sign in an area where he was used to training, as part of a battle by the Sierra Club to keep bikes off the trails.Henson, Steve (Wednesday, 5 October 1994) Going for the Cycle. Los Angeles (California) Times. The encounter inspired Foster's next tour: a two-year tour called American Summits, which would place a full-scale mountain bike atop the highest natural point in each of the fifty states. Most of Foster's previous sponsors returned, although his bicycle changed from a Cannondale to a Klein, still in the red, white, and blue color scheme. The tour started in the summer of 1993 with multiple setbacks. Just before the tour began, Foster's manager died suddenly at the age of 33. In his first state, Arizona, Foster got lost on the way down from the summit. However, Foster was able to summit 48 state highpoints on his first try. California's Mount Whitney (the highest natural point in the continental United States) took him two attempts to succeed. He was placed under arrest at the base of Mount Rainier, Washington state's highpoint; after a court hearing held in a parking lot, Foster was allowed to take his bike to the summit as long as he left his wheels behind.Photo & Caption. Life Magazine. September 1990. The last stop on the tour was Alaska's Mount McKinley, the highest natural point on the North American continent. In the summer of 1995, Foster and his team of three others were dropped off by plane at the mountain's 7500-foot base during a blizzard. Immediately afterward, as the plane tried to depart, it was flipped upside-down and destroyed, although the pilot escaped with minor injuries. After they reached the 17,200-foot level and made camp with about 75 other climbers, a storm trapped the group for six days, leading to three deaths. As the storm rose above them briefly, Foster and his team reluctantly retreated, and his sponsors declined to fund a return trip.Henson, Steve (Thursday, 6 July 1995) Cyclist Finds McKinley isn't Your Average Mountain. Los Angeles (California) Times. The tour received significant press coverage. Following the tour, the Sierra Club and members of several cycling organizations sat down to negotiate sharing the country's trails.Strickland, Bill. American Summits Update. Bicycling Magazine, July 1994. Tour de Cuba Since childhood, Foster had desired to visit Cuba. Following the American Summits tour, Foster accepted an invitation to the country from Cuban president Fidel Castro and began planning a tour across the nation, in spite of the United States embargo against Cuba prohibiting Americans from visiting or doing business there.Webb, Tamara (Saturday, 24 January 1998) An American in Cuba. Visalia (California) Times- Delta. Several of Foster's sponsors declined to support the tour, and U.S. senator Jesse Helms called for Foster to be arrested upon his return.Warszawski, Marek (Wednesday, 18 May 2005) Cyclist's Life Plays Out on One Wild Ride After Another. The Fresno (California) Bee. Foster began the Tour de Cuba on November 21, 1997. The tour would be the longest bicycle tour in Cuba's history, covering 1,158 miles, from the easternmost point at Mais√≠ to Playa Larga on the Zapata Peninsula. Unlike his previous tours, Foster traveled this one with a co-rider representing Cuba, Alfredo Rodriguez Martinez. Like his previous tours, this one included an arrest, when Mais√≠'s captain of the guard could not initially verify that Foster was a guest of Castro. The matter was cleared up the next day, and Foster was able to begin his ride. Over the three-week tour, Foster visited many of Cuba's landmarks, such as the grave of national hero Jos√© Mart√≠ in Santiago de Cuba; Cuba's highest natural point in Pico Turquino; and the Bay of Pigs, which had become a luxury resort. The tour completed on December 11, 1997.Foster, Kevin. Cycling Castro's Country: The Tour de Cuba. Pisces Publications. California (2004) On his way home that December, Foster was met by government officials at the Toronto, Ontario, Canada, airport while trying to board a connecting flight. Foster's passport was scanned and sent to Washington, D.C., but no arrest or further confrontations ever materialized. In January 1998, Foster announced his retirement from being an adventure cyclist, having proved that a mountain bike could be taken anywhere with the right motivation. Post- retirement projects In the years following his retirement, Foster made many personal appearances at events for his sponsors and for charity, as well as private engagements. Since 2006, he has held an annual charity bike ride in Sequoia National Park to benefit Smile Train, an organization providing surgery to children with cleft lips and palates.Carroll, Gerald (Wednesday, 18 August 2010) 'Bicycle Adventurer' Foster Plans Movie.

In that same year, according to the Beer Institute, the brewing industry employed around 43,000 Americans in brewing and distribution and had a combined economic impact of more than $246 billion. Since the turn of the century, the number of craft breweries in Alaska has increased dramatically, reflecting a nationwide trend in the United States.Quinn, Steve (January 17, 2016). \\"Beer Boom: Breweries Pop Up Across Alaska\\", Alaska Dispatch News.

Ram√≥n de Bonifaz (1196-1252 or 1256) was a medieval Spanish naval leader best known for breaking a river barricade leading to the capture of Seville from the Moors.Ruiz, p. 177. Bonifaz made his fortune as a merchant in Burgos, a city on the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela, and may have descended from one of the many French or Italian families that settled along the sacred way. He had achieved clear financial success by 1227 when he purchased an extremely expensive house. Having made his fortune, Bonifaz served as alcalde or mayor of the city for much of the early thirteenth century. The Torre del Oro (at right) anchored one end of the barricade in the Guadalquivir. It marks where the Moorish defenses spanned the river. In 1247 King Ferdinand of Castile and Le√≥n ordered Bonifaz to organize a fleet to join in the reconquista of Seville. Bonifaz drew his motley navy mostly from ships in the Bay of Biscay and took them up the Guadalquivir River to attack the Almohad held city. Moorish ships from Seville, Ceuta, and Tangier met Bonifaz at the mouth of the Guadalquivir.Irving, p. 517.Callcott, p. 418. Bonifaz's force of thirteen large ships combined with smaller vessels sunk several ships and drove the others away. In 1248, Bonifaz famously broke the city's river defenses leading to the fall of Seville. The Moors barricaded the river with a pontoon bridge braced with a heavy, metal chain that stretched from the Torre del Oro (Tower of the Gold) to the opposite bank. The bridge connected Seville to the outlying neighborhood of Triana and became the only supply line for the besieged city. Bonifaz rammed the barrier with fortified boats and broke the barricade.Irving, p. 536. Without a source of provisions, Seville soon surrendered.Calcott, 420. Bonifaz received many honors for his role in the reconquest of Seville. He was made a royal official in 1252, and may have been the first Admiral of CastileGonz√°lez, p. 164. even though some scholars consider the evidence for Bonifaz having this title weak. Bonifaz's descendants played a major role in the political and social life of Burgos for more than a century after the admiral's death.Ruiz, p. 178. The coat of arms of Cantabria shows Bonifaz breaking the chains across the Guadalquivir.

After a modest playing career, Ujiri became a scout in 2002, first for the Orlando Magic and then the Denver Nuggets. In 2008, he joined the backroom staff of the Toronto Raptors. Ujiri returned to the Nuggets in 2010 as general manager and executive vice president of basketball operations, and helped turn the team's fortunes around, returning them to the playoffs. As a result, he was named the NBA Executive of the Year in 2013. The following season, Ujiri returned to the Raptors as general manager. In the summer of 2018, Masai Ujiri relinquished his title as general manager to Bobby Webster, and accepted the position of president of basketball operations. As president, Ujiri worked to usher in a period of sustained success, helping the team win its first NBA championship in 2019. Masai Ujiri was shoved by a law enforcement officer at a basketball game on June 14th, 2019. Masai claimed that this occurred because he is black..August 21, 2020. Early life Ujiri was born in Bournemouth, England, to a Nigerian family. His parents were foreign students in England. With the family moving back to Nigeria when he was two years old, he grew up in Zaria, Nigeria. Ujiri's father, a hospital administrator and nursing educator, is an Isoko from Aviara in Delta state, while his mother, a doctor, is a Kenyan from Machakos County. He originally played association football as a youth before stating his interest in basketball as a 13-year-old playing with friends on outdoor basketball courts in northern Nigeria. This interest was fed by American sports magazines and VHS tapes of NBA games or basketball movies. He admired Hakeem Olajuwon, an NBA star who was also Nigerian. Entering high school, his parents allowed him to pursue his dream of playing college basketball and join a team in one of Europe‚Äôs top leagues. He left Nigeria to play for Nathan Hale High School in Seattle, WA while staying with a Nigerian family. After a stint overseas, Ujiri enrolled and played two years of basketball at Bismarck State College, a junior college in North Dakota. After community college, he transferred to Montana State University Billings but left after one semester. He left Montana and returned to England to begin a pro career. Playing career Ujiri spent his entire professional playing career in Europe. Before attending college, Ujiri played one season with the Solent Stars in the National Basketball League Division 3, then the fourth tier of English basketball. Ujiri and his team won the title that season with a 20‚Äì2 record. Following his collegiate career, Ujiri played a season for the Derby Rams in England. He then returned to Solent Stars, playing two seasons either side of a short stint with Belgian side Tournai-Estaimpuis, followed by just one appearance with Hemel Royals. Ujiri later spent three months in Finland with BC Nokia, where he played two preseason games before being waived. He last played in Denmark. Executive career After ending a professional playing career in 2002, Ujiri worked as a youth coach in Nigeria. During an NBA summer league game in Boston, he met David Thorpe, who eventually introduced him to college coaches.Ian Harrison. \\"Masai Ujiri takes reins in Denver\\". Sports Magazine.

In 2002, Ujiri was accompanying a young Nigerian player to a draft tryout in Orlando when he impressed Magic scouting director Gary Brokaw, who then introduced Ujiri to coach Doc Rivers and GM John Gabriel. Ujiri then became an unpaid scout for the NBA's Orlando Magic, paying his own way when he had to and sharing rooms with scouts or players when he could. Jeff Weltman, then a young executive with the Denver Nuggets, introduced Ujiri to Nuggets general manager Kiki Vandeweghe, who then hired Ujiri on salary as an international scout. After four seasons there, he was hired away by Bryan Colangelo of the Toronto Raptors as their Director of Global Scouting. Ujiri became the Raptors' assistant general manager in 2008.

With this post, Ujiri became the first African-born general manager in major American sports.\\"Masai Ujiri to be named NBA executive of the year for Denver Nuggets\\", Denver Post, Benjamin Hochman, May 8, 2013. After putting together a Nuggets‚Äô roster that won 57 games, the most in Denver‚Äôs NBA history, Ujiri was named the 2013 NBA Executive of the Year. He is the only non-American ever to win the award. Toronto Raptors On May 31, 2013, Ujiri signed a 5-year, $15 million deal to become executive vice president and general manager of the Toronto Raptors, replacing Colangelo in that capacity. One of his first moves as Raptors GM was to trade away Andrea Bargnani to the New York Knicks. During Ujiri's tenure as general manager, the Raptors, led by the backcourt duo of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, returned to the playoffs in 2014. On April 19, 2014, at a fan rally prior to Game 1 of the first-round Eastern Conference playoff series against the Brooklyn Nets, Ujiri shouted, \\"F--- Brooklyn!\\" to the gathered crowd from the stage. Ujiri apologized during halftime of Game 1, stating: \\"wrong choice of words. I apologize to kids out there and to the Brooklyn guys.\\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver fined Ujiri $25,000. On April 18, 2015, at a fan rally before the playoff series between the Washington Wizards and the Raptors, in response to comments from Wizards guard Paul Pierce that the Raptors don't have the \\"it\\" factor, Ujiri shouted to the gathered crowd, \\"We don't give a s--t about 'it!'\\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver fined Ujiri $35,000 and the Raptors organization another $25,000. Ujiri apologized for his comments saying, \\"I will choose my words more carefully in the future.\\" Under Ujiri, the Raptors became a consistent playoff team every year, winning five Division titles and finishing the 2017-18 regular season with the best regular season record in the Eastern Conference. He also helped the team reach the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history in 2016, where his contract was extended to act as the team's president. His title as general manager was then transferred to Jeff Weltman. After Weltman left the organization to join the Orlando Magic in 2017, Bobby Webster was named as the team's new general manager, and began reshaping the Raptors roster after suffering consecutive second-round eliminations in 2017 and 2018 (both four-game sweeps), all three playoff defeats at the hands of the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by LeBron James. Ujiri fired head coach Dwane Casey shortly after their 2018 2nd round exit to Lebron James and the Cavs (despite Casey being named Coach of the Year), promoting assistant Nick Nurse to head coach, conducted the high-profile trade of DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green later that summer, and acquired Marc Gasol before the trade deadline. The DeRozan-for-Leonard trade was initially controversial since DeRozan was the longest-tenured Raptor and fan favourite while Leonard had spent most of the 2017-18 season injured, along with his demand to be traded to a Los Angeles-based team only. However, the move paid off as the Raptors went on to win the 2019 NBA championship, their first title in the history of their franchise, and Leonard was named NBA Finals MVP. = 2019 NBA Finals incident = On June 13, 2019, just after the Toronto Raptors had clinched a 4-2 series win over the Golden State Warriors in the 2019 NBA Finals, Ujiri was captured on video in an altercation with an Alameda County Sheriff deputy. Sgt. Ray Kelly, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, alleged that Ujiri failed to show proper credentials for access to the floor. Sgt. Kelly further alleged that when stopped, Ujiri had shoved a sheriff's deputy, that the deputy had made contact in response, and that Ujiri shoved the deputy back and made contact with his face. Several bystanders and Oracle Arena security personnel intervened to separate the two. After a tense staredown between the men, Ujiri was restrained from approaching the deputy. Raptors player Kyle Lowry then came over to Ujiri and escorted him onto the court to celebrate with the team. Alternate angles of the incident appear to show Ujiri shouting in the direction of the deputy with his arm around Lowry after making his way onto the court. The Sheriff's Department did not release body camera footage depicting the start of the incident and announced that their footage had happened to \\"switch off\\" when Ujiri allegedly struck the officer. Warriors season ticketholder Greg Wiener, who was seated near the altercation, alleged that the deputy used excessive force and initiated physical contact, while two other fans (Ben Baller and Lucas Abrenica) that were sitting within 10 feet of the incident also disputed the deputy's version of events. In the videos, Ujiri can be seen with game credentials in his hand. However, the NBA had released a media advisory prior to the conclusion of the game stating that only personnel with gold armbands would be allowed on the court due to a visiting team winning. Many of the gold armbands were visible on photographers and executives on the court (including members of the Raptors ownership), but are not visible in any angles of Ujiri during the incident. Following the altercation, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office stated that it would be recommending charges of battery against Ujiri. The deputy involved has claimed to have suffered a concussion from the incident. The investigation ended on September 21. Following a private meeting on October 21, 2019 with Ujiri, his attorneys and Assistant District Attorney Terry Wiley, which was held at the Sheriff's Department, Assistant District Attorney Teresa Drenick announced that the District Attorney's office would not take further action in connection with the incident. Deputy Alan Strickland's body camera footage was released in August 2020. The footage showed Ujiri reaching for his game credentials, but neither the purple trophy credential or the yellow armband credential needed to access the court postgame is seen before the deputy shoved Ujiri twice in the chest. The footage revealed that the deputy, not Ujiri, initiated the physical contact. On October 6, 2020, Strickland's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss a counterclaim to a lawsuit from Ujiri. A Zoom hearing was scheduled for November 17.https://globalnews.ca/news/7381439/masai-ujiri-alan-strickland-lawsuit/ Activism Ujiri, then a scout for the Nuggets, founded Giants of Africa in 2003 with the goal of discovering basketball talent.

Hollywood Husbands is an unrelated sequel to Hollywood Wives and features a new cast of characters. Although it continues the theme of power and celebrity in Hollywood, the novel also contains a mystery plot about a young girl from a small American town, who was sexually abused and later left for dead. Years later, the Hollywood husbands may be the ones to feel the heat of her burning revenge.Google Books - Hollywood Husbands - ¬©2010 Google. STORY - Oscar winning Hollywood actress Clarissa Browning had a traumatic past. Right from her childhood, she was repeatedly sexually abused by a series of men, including her own father. Her horrific experiences turned her into a psychotic serial killer and her oppressors became her victims. Anonymously she kept on running from one place to another after burning her tormentors to death, leaving no trails for the police to track her down. Fifteen years later she emerged as a most successful award winning Hollywood actress who used men as they had once used her. Her last plan was to explode the luxury yacht of a multi billionaire where all the Hollywood celebrities had gathered to attend the gala New Year's Eve party. These were the same people who did not bother to raise a finger when a superstar, in a drunken brawl, beat a lesser entity to death, to safeguard their own personal interests. Will Clarissa's plan for vengeance succeed? Collins went on to pen several more \\"Hollywood\\" titled books, including Hollywood Kids (1994), Hollywood Wives: The New Generation (2001), and Hollywood Divorces (2003). Although these further novels tend to be separate works rather than direct sequels, characters from the original Hollywood Wives have made brief appearances in the other novels. Main characters * Jack Python is the hottest Hollywood Husband of all. He rules nighttime T.V. and his controversial talk show burns up ratings, while the women he encounters melt. With one expensive divorce behind him, and involved in a highly erotic affair with Oscar-winning actress Clarissa Browning, Jack Python has power, charisma, success, and money. But sometimes everything is not enough. * Howard Soloman, head of Orpheus Studios is the man, the Hollywood King. Anything Howard wants, he gets. Including the women. The sweet smell of power and Howard's street- smart style reels them in. Working for billionaire studio owner Zachary Klinger, a man with a whim of iron, Howard has problems enough. And if Howard cannot deliver daytime soap megastar Silver Anderson at Klinger's command, he may lose his footing at the top of the heap. Though in Hollywood it is said that when you fall, you fall up‚Äîfrom the top Howard has nowhere to go but down. * Mannon Cable is a superstar. With great looks and a body to match, he is full of self-deprecating charm. Married briefly to gorgeous Whitney Valentine, who left him to become a television superstar; he was hit by the divorce where it really hurts‚Äîhis giant ego. * Jade Johnson - a top New York model. * Silver Anderson - a successful prime time television soap opera star. * Wesley Money - Wesley or Wes is the young, handsome husband of Silver Anderson. He is a street smart ex bar attender who loves Silver and takes care of all her needs. * Whitney Valentine - Mannon's ex-wife and a beautiful but talentless actress and pop star. * Clarissa Browning - a \\"serious\\", award- winning Hollywood actress who is also a psychotic serial killer. * Heaven Anderson Klinger - Silver Anderson's estranged teenage daughter and Jack Python's beloved niece. She is also the secret love child of multi billionaire Zacharey Klinger. She goes on to become a singing sensation, causing jealousy to her mother. SIMON & SCHUSTER - Books - Hollywood Husbands.

DsbA is a key component of the Dsb (disulfide bond) family of enzymes. DsbA catalyzes intrachain disulfide bond formation as peptides emerge into the cell's periplasm. Structurally, DsbA contains a thioredoxin domain with an inserted helical domain of unknown function. Like other thioredoxin-based enzymes, DsbA's catalytic site is a CXXC motif (CPHC in E. coli DsbA). The pair of cysteines may be oxidized (forming an internal disulfide) or reduced (as free thiols), and thus allows for oxidoreductase activity by serving as an electron pair donor or acceptor, depending on oxidation state. This reaction generally proceeds through a mixed-disulfide intermediate, in which a cysteine from the enzyme forms a bond to a cysteine on the substrate. DsbA is responsible for introducing disulfide bonds into nascent proteins. In equivalent terms, it catalyzes the oxidation of a pair of cysteine residues on the substrate protein. Most of the substrates for DsbA are eventually secreted, and include important toxins, virulence factors, adhesion machinery, and motility structures DsbA is localized in the periplasm, and is more common in Gram- negative bacteria than in Gram-positive bacteria. Within the thioredoxin family, DsbA is the most strongly oxidizing member. Using glutathione oxidation as a metric, DsbA is ten times more oxidizing than protein disulfide-isomerase (the eukaryotic equivalent of DsbA). The extremely oxidizing nature of DsbA is due to an increase in stability upon reduction of DsbA, thereby imparting a decrease in energy of the enzyme when it oxidizes substrate. This feature is incredibly rare among proteins, as nearly all proteins are stabilized by the formation of disulfide bonds. DsbA's highly oxidizing nature is a result of hydrogen bond, electrostatic and helix-dipole interactions that favour the thiolate over the disulfide at the active site. After donating its disulfide bond, DsbA is regenerated by the membrane-bound protein DsbB.

Brewing companies vary widely in the volume and variety of beer produced, from small nanobreweries and microbreweries to massive multinational conglomerate macrobreweries. In 2012 New Mexico's 35 brewing establishments (including breweries, brewpubs, importers, and company-owned packagers and wholesalers) employed 90 people directly, and more than 6,400 others in related jobs such as wholesaling and retailing. Altogether 34 people in New Mexico had active brewer permits in 2012. Including people directly employed in brewing, as well as those who supply New Mexico's breweries with everything from ingredients to machinery, the total business and personal tax revenue generated by New Mexico's breweries and related industries was more than $131 million. Consumer purchases of New Mexico's brewery products generated more than $69 million extra in tax revenue. In 2012, according to the Brewers Association, New Mexico ranked 12th in the number of craft breweries per capita with 27. For context, at the end of 2013 there were 2,822 breweries in the United States, including 2,768 craft breweries subdivided into 1,237 brewpubs, 1,412 microbreweries and 119 regional craft breweries. In that same year, according to the Beer Institute, the brewing industry employed around 43,000 Americans in brewing and distribution and had a combined economic impact of more than $246 billion. Historic breweries The Illinois Brewery in Socorro Southwestern Brewery in Albuquerque Breweries operated in various New Mexico towns during the late 1800s, though few survived until statewide Prohibition began in 1918. Some of the more notable breweries include: *Illinois Brewing Company (1882‚Äì1918) in Socorro. The company started as a liquor wholesaler before moving into brewing in the mid-1880s. After Prohibition, the company continued to produce ice and soft drinks until 1965. The former brewery is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and currently operates as a museum. *Southwestern Brewery and Ice Company (1888‚Äì1918) in Albuquerque. The brewery made various beers including the well-known Glorieta brand. The company did not return to brewing after Prohibition but continued to produce ice until 1997. The 1899 brewery building is still standing and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. *New Mexico Brewing Company (1936‚Äì37) in Albuquerque. This was the only brewery to open in the post- Prohibition era, though it failed after less than a year. The brewery was auctioned and reopened as Rio Grande Brewing Company (1937‚Äì39). Also a short- lived venture, its products included Rio Grande Lager. The brewery building at 2nd and Marquette was converted to residential units and is still standing.

When the police search her handbag to find out her identity, they are astonished to discover a series of top secret military blueprints. The secret service are alerted and arrive at the hospital to question her, but she laughs in their faces before quietly dying. The man for the job is top secret service agent Tommy Blythe (Walls), who happens to be on honeymoon with new wife Louise (Saint-Cyr). He is summoned back to London under conditions of absolute secrecy, not allowed to divulge any details even to Louise, who naturally does not believe his unconvincing cover story and jumps to the conclusion that he is having an affair. Enquiries lead to the Notting Hill boarding house where the dead woman lived and Tommy takes a room there incognito to try to infiltrate what is assumed to be a nest of spies. Louise follows him to London and confronts him, and he is forced against orders to take her into his confidence. She also takes a room and the couple pretend not to know each other, giving their names as a Mr. Bullock and a Miss Heffer. Together they set about the task of observing and investigating the sundry assortment of fellow lodgers, knowing that some are completely innocent while others harbour dark and treacherous secrets which threaten the very nation. From the grasping landlady Mrs. Dewar (Irene Handl) and the meek maid Elsie (Withers), through to fellow boarders including a blind man (Adam), a Boer War colonel and his wife apparently in retirement, a travelling salesman, a scatty old biddy and a merchant of Argentinian meat, all come under suspicion before the wily pair of sleuths manage to untangle the web of lies and false leads to reveal who in the household is or is not a traitor.

Its first editor was the Italian theatre critic and journalist, Silvio D'Amico. Considered to be the most comprehensive international performing arts encyclopedia, it is included in the reference section of many libraries. History The Encyclopedia of Performing Arts was created by two separate projects, one dating to 1945 and the other to 1954. Early version Starting in 1945 or 1946, D'Amico conceived of a project to develop an encyclopedia of the performing arts. Undertaken by an editorial team composed of a few people and led by D'Amico, it was produced in three or four years and contained four volumes. Considered superficial, it was not publishable. However, it developed a model for scientific study of the theater and other performing arts. Later version Conceived as a set of 12 volumes, the second project took on an ethnographic approach. It had the advantage of a stable editorial group and used foreign employees. D'Amico's editorial staff worked at the Palazzo Doria Pamphili, Via del Plebiscito 112. The attorney Carlo Min√π, D'Amico's brother-in-law, found funding for the second project and referred D'Amico to publishers. In drawing up lists of dramas, operas, ballets and films, the editorial team wondered if it their work was worthwhile or helpful. It was Francesco Savio who sometimes said, \\"Of course it is; if someone else wants one day to create an Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, they would find this materials to be useful.\\" When the news spread that the encyclopedia was about to be published, a delegation arrived wanting guidance in the organizational work to start up an encyclopedia of Prague theater. The structure of the work was better articulated. Responsibility for each section, such as film, music, or theater, was delegated to an initial small staff that rapidly grew to thirty editors that coordinated over five hundred employees. Large blocks of work were assigned to collaborators, many of them in foreign countries. D'Amico felt that the second project benefited from finding amateur collectors without whose assistance entire sectors of biographical entries would have been less detailed. Collected material came from abroad or was bought directly in the antique market. An example of a collector was Ulderico Rolandi, a gynecologist who lived in the Via Veneto, and who had made a hobby of collecting, filing and examining librettos. He had accumulated what was thought to be the largest collection of opera librettos after the Library of Congress. Another example was David Turcotte who had developed a catalog of American cinema. The project suffered a severe crisis in 1957, two years after the death of D'Amico, due to disagreements between the editorial office and the publisher. The publisher's expectation was to publish two volumes a year, but the editorial staff was only able to put out a single volume each year. Because of this crisis, there is an imbalance between the first volume and the last four whose detail is considered sometimes less accurate. Editions Published between 1954 and 1962, the original nine volume Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo covers ballet, films, opera, plays, theater, vaudeville, and other areas of entertainment. They include signed essays that discuss performers, directors, and writers. Other sections discuss genres and themes, as well as history, technical subjects, and bibliographies. The encyclopedia is over 18,000 pages in length and profusely illustrated with thousands of illustrations of which 700 are in the text, 1800 are out of the text, and there are 320 color plates. The first print run of 10,000 copies was followed by a reprint of 5,000 additional copies. Originally published in Rome by Casa Editrice Le Maschere, reprints were published by UNEDI. Published in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1966, the Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Aggiornamento 1955-1965 (\\"Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, Supplementary 1955-1965) is an update of the main set. The Aggiornamento addresses developments and biographies. Published in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1968, the Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Indice-repertorio (Encyclopedia of Performing Arts. Index- Directory) is a title index of the 145,000 entries cited in the main set and the supplements. It addresses author, genre and year of composition. Personnel and management D'Amico conceived of the project and brought it to fruition. The theater section was under the direction of Luigi Squarzina; he also did the film section. D'Amico's father worked on the drama theatre section, while his brother Mario worked on the music section. Gabriele Baldini and later Gian Luigi Rondi were responsible for the cinema section. Additional sections were led by others including: classical antiquity by Bruno Gentili, German theater by Paolo Chiarini, Slavic theater by Angelo Maria Ripellino, English theater by Brunacci, French theater by Gian Carlo Roscioni, Iberian theater by Luciana Stegagno Picchio, and Italian theater by Niccol√≤ Gallo, Giulio Cesare Castello, and Caesar Garboli. The Chamber music section was under the direction of D'Amico's son, Fedele D'Amico, a musicologist, with Nino Pirrotta, Franco Serpa and Emilia Zanetti as editors. Consultants included Sabatino Moscati for Hebrew and Yiddish theater; Dario Puccini for the Iberian language theater; Luigi Salvini for Slavic, Finno-Ugric and Romanian language theater; Giuliano Bertuccioli for Chinese language theater. Almost all of the drawings were made by young, recent graduates. Some of the illustrations were edited by Helen Poveledo. Texts and drafts were reviewed by professors. Critical and popular assessments Most libraries found it to be an essential component of their reference section. The proposed biographies of many lesser figures were not included as the editorial staff were unable to keep up with the publisher's deadline. Criticisms of the encyclopedia have included the fact that it was only available in the Italian language, that it was Eurocentric, and that non-European theater and 20th century theater were underrepresented. While the encyclopedia was first published in the 1950s, it was based on pre-World War II documentation. By the 1970s, the Encyclopedia of Performing Arts was considered out of date.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, a class of proteins that functions as molecular scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes at specialized regions of the plasma membrane. This protein is also a member of the CARD-CC protein family, which is defined by carrying a characteristic caspase-associated recruitment domain (CARD) and a coiled-coil (CC) domain. This protein thus shares a similar domain structure with the CARD10 and CARD11 proteins. The CARD domains of both proteins have been shown to specifically interact with BCL10, a protein known to function as a positive regulator of cell apoptosis and NF-Œ∫B activation. The homotypic interaction with BCL10 is believed to be prevented by the linker region of CARD14, when in an inactive state. CARD14 overexpression leads to an activation of the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B and phosphorylation of BCL10. CARD14 has been shown to form a CBM signalosome, similar to the signalling of CARD11, with BCL10 and MALT1.  Link to Psoriasis  The CARD14 gene was recently identified as the first gene directly linked to the most common form of Psoriasis. It has been suggested that a mutation in the gene plus an environmental trigger were enough to elicit plaque psoriasis. These rare, but highly penetrant, mutations were found to disrupt an auto-inhibited state of CARD14, which leads to the binding of BCL10 and the activation of NF-Œ∫B.

Later they released records under a second imprint called 'Sandy Hook Records' which was designated as a 'music only' label. They released music broadcasts, film soundtracks and reissued commercial recordings that had been out of print for many years. When LP's began to be phased out, Radiola and Sandy Hook became a 'cassette only' format. Shortly before the sale of the company they started experimenting with the CD format. They released 'custom tapes' of radio programs from their archive. At $12 per hour a customer could select shows to add to their own collections. They also began a catalogue of shows called GOLDIN RADIO LIBRARY which eventually contained hundreds of preselected shows on cassette. The 'Goldin' spelling is from the name of the company founder, J. David Goldin. They also started a cassette/CD reissue series called STACKS of 78s that contained recordings from their collection of 78's. Most of these had been out of print recordings that had been unavailable for many years. They made no effort at sound restoration so some of the releases had a lot of scratch and surface noise. As 'Video Yesteryear', they are best known for presenting silent films and slower speeds than a standard 16mm projector would normally show, bringing the early films closer to their silent film running time. This process was known as Video Accu-Speed and described as a \\"prism optical\\" process. It unfortunately had the effect of making the film darker the closer it got to the edges. Their silent film releases also included original organ scores composed and performed by Rosa Rio (1902‚Äì2010), who had been a theatre organist during the silent era. The company was purchased by Audio Book Club in 1998.

Therefore, most governments have seen graffiti as detrimental, and have outlawed the practice. However, due to most instances of graffiti occurring in public spaces, local governments are responsible for graffiti removal in order to maintain the beautification of their local shire, council or city. Graffiti as a negative externality Graffiti on a wall in London. Governments see graffiti as a negative externality because it largely inhibits or detracts from the beautification of a local community.Mushin. (2008). An Illustration of the Importance of Elasticities in Microeconomic Policy. Australasian Journal of Economics Education, 5, 1-5. This can often stigmatise a neighbourhood or community through being labelled as a low socio-economic area. Indeed, this converts to suppressed housing prices and has strong correlations with local crime and gang activities.Aneshernsel, C. S., & Sucoff, C. A. (1996). The neighbourhood context of adolescent mental health. Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 4 (37), 293-310. Considering the great cost graffiti incurs on local communities, governments take the burden of the negative externality, through removal. Due to the nature of graffiti, it is near impossible to eliminate, despite changes to legislation to increase the fine for committing such offences. Removal methods Governments take different approaches to graffiti removal, often depending on their resources. These approaches have been developed and shifted due to larger movements within the cleaning industry, costs of supplies and the end results of removals. Paint out A white block of paint covering graffiti, which has then been graffitied on top of This method involves painting over the graffiti so that it can no longer be seen. This is considered a low costs method and has historically been used widely by governments. However, over time the negative effects of this removal method begin to surface. Although effective for already painted walls, this removal option often leads to poor results on other surfaces, as it appears out of place and develops a \\"patchwork effect\\" on the surface. Furthermore, if this method is used regularly on the same wall or surface, the paint begins to peel, leading to the method being an ineffective long-term strategy for graffiti removal. Chemical removal Chemical removal of graffiti from a train in Germany This method actually removes the graffiti in earnest. These are cleaning products with active chemicals which remove the graffiti from the surface. These methods are largely effective. However, with poor application of the chemical, this approach has been found to damage the surface, especially painted surfaces. In these cases the paint along with the graffiti is stripped, leading to a poor result. In addition, the increasing prevalence of environmental sustainability makes this method an increasingly outdated method of removal. Mechanics of graffiti removal There are four controllable factors that should be understood when removing graffiti. *Time ‚Äì The longer the contact time the deeper the graffiti remover will penetrate. The more sensitive the surface the shorter the time the graffiti product is on the surface. *Temperature ‚Äì Warmer weather speeds up the rate in which the graffiti remover products operate. *Agitation ‚Äì When graffiti removal products are applied by means of hard bristled brushes or scourers, it assists in breaking the bond between the graffiti and the surface. NOTE: be careful on sensitive surfaces, otherwise the underlying surface may be damaged. *Chemical ‚Äì Use the right chemical for the task at hand. To compensate for any reduction in one of these for variables increase one of the other variables i.e. Should the temperature be cold, increase the contact time between the graffiti and the graffiti remover, alternatively you could increase the temperature, by using a hot water pressure washing system. Environmentally sustainable removal This method involves using organic products which remove the graffiti from the surface. This approach is comparable in cost to a chemical or paint out removal, and often have the benefit of lower or no safety and health risk. Baking Soda or Dry Ice Blasting is an environmentally sustainable method of removing graffiti. This process involves using abrasive particles to safely remove the paint without damaging surfaces. Surfaces that respond well to blasting are concrete, brick, stone, wood, and glass. Graffiti on historic surfaces Many graffiti removal methods involve abrasive processes (wire-brushing, grit blasting, etc.) or the use of powerful and potentially hazardous chemical solvents, which may damage historic fabric such as the stone facade of a historic building. Laser cleaning (using lasers of the Nd: YAG wavelength), although more expensive, is likely to be more appropriate for historic stonework. Some chemical cleaning agents can also be used with an inert poultice material, in which case the chemical is usually applied first to dissolve the pigment, followed by the poultice to draw the pigment in solution out of the substrate. Removal of graffiti from historic surfaces and objects should only be undertaken by appropriately trained and skilled personnel. Management Governments have found that the faster a piece of graffiti is removed, the less future graffiti occurs in that location. As a result, several different graffiti removal management methods have been developed to locate and remove graffiti efficiently. Reactive Governments cannot organize the removal of graffiti until they are aware of the graffiti that exists. The Reactive Removal Method relies on the government waiting for calls from concerned citizens. There are various community programs which assist in raising awareness of graffiti to prompt removal. This method is effective in non-regular cases, and in neighbourhoods with concerned and persistent citizens, however for locations with chronic levels of graffiti are rarely reported. This is due to the assumed futility of reporting the graffiti. Proactive Governments with more foresight and resources include an inspection regimen with their graffiti removal management. These inspections highlight graffiti offences faster than Reactive Removal Management. This method has been adopted in most major cities, where there are great enough economies of scale to make this kind of operation viable. In addition to inspections, Proactive Removal Management uses sealants to protect graffiti-prone locations. Sealants protect the surface and significantly reduce the cost of removing the graffiti from the surface. Initially, these were only available for painted surfaces, but products have been designed to protect a range of surfaces, such as brick and concrete. Predictive A new and emerging approach to graffiti removal management is Predictive Removal Management. This involves the use of a database of information regarding graffiti incidents within a city. This is often developed by the government or the graffiti removal service provider. This database is then data mined to determine patterns in graffiti offences. This can then be used to tailor more accurate inspections, as well as allow authorities to allocate resources more efficiently. This reduces the time taken to find and remove graffiti.

She is being held under Article 84 of Vietnam's penal code, which is often used to charge and convict pro-democracy activists.  Background  Vo came to Australia in 1982 and is currently a social worker for the City of Yarra. She is a single mother of two, and has been active in the Vietnamese community.  Arrest  Vo assisted in organising a peaceful demonstration on October 9, 2010 in Hanoi to affirm Vietnamese sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly Islands. During the rally which was attended by approximately 70 people, she passed out leaflets, T-shirts, and hats in relation to the Paracel and Spratly Islands dispute. She was then arrested in the evening of October 10, 2010. The arrest occurred at the airport in Ho Chi Minh City, as Mrs. Vo was boarding a plan to Bangkok. Her son was on a phone call with her, when the call ended abruptly. She was then put into detainment without access to a lawyer. While Vietnam has alerted the international community on her arrest already on October 11, 2010, authorities in Vietnam did not confirm the arrest until October 12, 2010. She was held under Article 84 of Vietnam's penal code, which is often used to charge and convict pro-democracy activists. During her arrest, her exact whereabouts are unknown, and other than a confirmation that she has been arrested, no further information has been provided by the government. In a later interview, Vo described that she shared a cell with another prisoner, and was completely isolated from the world. Vo received a visit from the Australian consulate on October 18, 2010  Release  After the Australian consulate in Vietnam intervened in the case, Hong Vo was released from prison on October 21, 2010 and immediately expelled from the country without the possibility for her to ever return. She returned to Australia after a total of ten days of detainment. From her experience, she comments that \\"she will struggle to return to the country of her birth after spending 10 terrifying days in a Vietnamese jail.\\"  International Response  State Labor MP Luke Donnellan, who personally knows Ms Vo well from her community work, promised to file a protest with the Vietnamese Embassy. He comments, \\"I will tell them how annoyed I am that they have arrested an Australian citizen and incarcerated her. It's totally inappropriate. Especially since we're talking about people handing out leaflets in relation to democracy, not actually any criminal acts\\". A Facebook fan page has been created, as well as an online petition to ask for Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard's assistance in releasing Ms Vo has been created.

It has velvety silver leaves, bears masses of bright-pink, sweetly scented flowers, and is indigenous to the Western Cape, South Africa. Description Podalyria calyptrata is a small, tough, fast-growing tree around 4 meters in height. The simple, oval leaves are silvery grey and velvety in texture. The bright-pink, strongly fragrant flowers are very striking and usually appear in spring (although flowering time varies). The flowers are very strongly fragrant, and their sweet scent can be smelled from afar. The seeds are contained in hard little pods that appear considerably later. Distribution and habitat This tree occurs from Cape Town northwards as far as Tulbagh and eastwards across the Cape Fold mountains. It grows amongst fynbos and on the verges of forests. Cultivation Once established, P. calyptrata tolerates wind, frost, and drought, but it is healthiest when it gets regular water and it does not grow well in highly salty or alkaline soils. Overall, it is very easy to grow. It makes a good informal hedge or screen along the edge of a property. It also makes a handsome specimen plant, with its bright flowers and attractive foliage. If planted in full sun and lightly pruned of young shoots, it becomes more bushy. If planted in the shade, it tends to become a taller tree, with less dense foliage. P. calyptrata can easily be propagated from seed. Allow the seeds to soak briefly in warm water before planting them.

Munira Bibi, the widow of the victim, eventually regretted her ill-fated visit to her parental home where she lost her husband.  Background  Shailendra Prasad, a native of Bihar, worked as a labourer in Mumbai, where Munira worked as a maid servant. They fell in love and married in 2001. Munira came from an orthodox village, where a ' court had fined her father Ansari Sheikh a sum of two hundred rupees for sending his daughter to work in Mumbai.  Trial and execution  The couple visited Lakshmanpur again in July 2006, this time with their ten-month-old son. As on the previous occasion, Shailendra had to assume the identity of Munna Sheikh to escape the wrath of the orthodox villagers. His father-in-law Ansari Sheikh, however, noticed that he did not offer his Friday prayers, nor responded spontaneously to greetings. On 14 July, Ansari Sheikh overheard a muttering from Shailendra during a religious ritual, that was a dead giveaway of his religion and informed the village elders his suspicion in the afternoon. A ' court was convened on the grounds of the village primary school that evening by the village elders. At the court, Shailendra was forcibly disrobed to check his religious identity and when he was found uncircumcised he was beaten up severely. Twenty-two political and religious leaders of the ' court, along with Ansari Sheikh, pronounced Shailendra guilty of marrying a Muslim girl and awarded him the death sentence. His hands and feet were tied up. He was gagged and taken to a nearby jute field, where his throat was slit by four executioners. As Shailendra Prasad went missing from the night of 14 July, his wife Munira Bibi believed that he had fled to Mumbai. Her father had kept everything from her mother and brother. On 27 July, when Munira learned of her husband's fate from other villagers she accompanied her mother and brother to the Berhampore police station to lodge a formal complaint. The police had already discovered the beheaded body of an unidentified man inside a gunny bag lying in the jute fields ten days before on 17 July. On 28 July, the police raided the village and arrested three persons who presided over the '. The rest of the villagers who took part in the ' and Ansari Sheikh fled the village. On 1 August, a large police force led by the additional Superintendent of Police Debashis Bej raided the village of Lakshmanpur and detained 26 villagers for interrogation.

Marsiyas are essentially religious.A History of Urdu literature by T. Grahame Bailey; Urdu Poetry in Lucknow in the 19th century Background The word Marsiya is derived from the Arabic word marthiyya (root R-TH-Y), meaning a great tragedy or lamentation for a departed soul. Marsiya is a poem written to commemorate the martyrdom of Ahl al-Bayt, Imam Hussain and Battle of Karbala. It is usually a poem of mourning. This form found a specially congenial soil in Lucknow, an important Shia Muslim community in the Indian subcontinent, where it was regarded as an act of piety and religious duty to eulogize and bemoan the martyrs of the battle of Karbala. The genre was championed by Mir Babar Ali Anis. Famous marsiya writers in Urdu include Mir Babar Ali Anis, Mirza Salamat Ali Dabeer, Ali Haider Tabatabai, Najm Afandi, Josh Malihabadi, and others. Well-known Persian poets of the genre include Muhtasham Kashani and Samet Borujerdi. In Turkish, B√¢k√Æ composed an important marsiya. Mir Babar Ali Anis, a renowned Urdu poet, composed salƒÅms, elegies, nohas and quatrains. While the length of elegy initially had no more than forty or fifty stanzas, he pushed it beyond one hundred fifty or even longer than two hundred stanzas or bands, as each unit of marsiya in the musaddas format is known. Mir Anis drew upon the vocabulary of Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hindi, and Awadhi to a great degree.Marsiya by Shiraz e Hind on May 15th, 2010 He has become an essential element of Muharram among the Urdu-speakers of the Indian subcontinent. The first major and still current critical articulation about Mir Anis was Muazna-e-Anis-o-Dabir (1907) written by Shibli Nomani in which he said \\"the poetic qualities and merits of Anis are not matched by any other poet\\". Chhannu Lal Dilgeer (c 1780 ‚Äì c 1848), another marsiya poet, was born during the reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah. He was initially a ghazal poet with the takhallus ‚ÄòTarab‚Äô, before focusing on marsiya at a later stage. He converted to Islam and changed his name to Ghulam Hussain.

It is usually about 5 m tall (but reaches a height of 20 m when growing in deep forest), and it is indigenous to Southern Africa. The taxonomical family placement for this and other Apodytes was uncertain; it is now placed in the Metteniusaceae. Its English common name is in reference to the timber which is similar in appearance to that of the European pear tree of the northern hemisphere. Description In the open, this evergreen species grows as a tall shrub or small tree of about 5 m in height. However, in a more shady environment, such as deep afro-montane forest, it can reach a height of over 20 m. Its dense, shiny foliage is bright-green and it has smooth, gray bark. It frequently produces masses of tiny, white, bisexual blossoms which have a sweet fragrance. These are followed by strangely curved, black and scarlet berries. In South Africa this is officially a protected tree. This is a very difficult tree to identify at first. In particular, it is often confused with Pterocelastrus rostratus, including at the First International Forestry Exhibition. The best identifying characteristics of Apodytes dimidiata are its petiole and young terminal branchlets which are a unique reddish colour. Distribution Apodytes dimidiata is a prominent and common tree in South African forests. It grows naturally from Cape Town in the south, all the way along the east coast of southern Africa as far north as Kenya and inland as far as Gauteng. It is usually found in coastal thicket, afro-montane forest and mountainous bushveld. The actual distribution has been difficult to determine due to large number of synonyms (about 30+) used for this particular species in various countries. According to the synonyms usage, it is thought that the species has much broader distribution than was thought earlier, and may spread towards the Indian subcontinent as well. Cultivation This tree's characteristics (evergreen attractive foliage; fruits that are not fleshy and therefore will not cause a mess; and a gentle non-invasive root system that will not damage paving) mean that Apodytes dimidiata is an ideal tree to plant around paved areas, near swimming pools, next to buildings, in small gardens and also anywhere that may need shade throughout the year. The white pear is best propagated by seed, though germination is extremely slow. The seed takes about half a year to germinate and the young plants are also relatively slow growing. However, these trees grow very much faster as they become larger and more established.

Initially involved in resistance to episcopal authority and in separatist activity in Shrewsbury and London, she emerged during the English Civil War as a powerful advocate of an Independent or Congregationalist polity. Under the Commonwealth of England and the Protectorate she was a leader of Leveller women, noted for her contribution to campaigns on behalf of John Lilburne. Shrewsbury Chidley's origins and background, even her own family name, are unknown. She first appears in Shrewsbury as the wife of Daniel Chidley. The Shrewsbury Burgess Roll lists him in 1621, under the name Chidloe, as a tailor and the son of William, a yeoman of Burlton, a village to the north of Shrewsbury.Shrewsbury Burgess Roll, p. 80. By this time he had two sons, Samuel and Daniel. Katherine may have been from Shrewsbury or the surrounding area, like Daniel, but it is impossible to be certain. The baptism of the first child, Samuel, described as the son of \\"Daniell Chedler\\" was recorded in the parish register of St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury on 13 April 1618:Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 7. the spelling of the surname is very varied. Between 1618 and 1629, the register records the baptisms of eight Chidley children and the burial of one, Daniel, who died in infancy.Coulton, p. 82-3. The couple were so intent on having a son with his father's name that they named a further son Daniel, which throws into question their naming of the first son. Katharine Gillespie has suggested that the naming of Samuel may have implied a likening of Katherine Chidley to the Biblical Hannah, who in dedicated her first child, Samuel, to God and refused the traditional purification ritual until the child was weaned.Gillespie, p. 80. Moreover, the dedication of the Biblical Samuel is followed by a prophetic utterance from Hannah, , the model for the Magnificat, that looks forward to an overturning of existing power relations.Gillespie, p. 81. Katherine Chidley herself was not mentioned in the parish register entries until the baptism on 12 February 1626 of the second Daniel, who was recorded as \\"s. of Daniell & Katharn Chedley\\" Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 46. Following the birth of the second Daniel, and possibly at earlier births, Katherine Chidley refused to undergo the Churching of women, a service prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer. She was not alone in this: the ceremony was suspect to Puritans, even of the fairly moderate kind. Particularly resented was the use of , with its striking spell-like verse 6, \\"The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.\\" Kathaerine, along with Judith Wright and five other women, was cited for refusing to be churched by the Peter Studley, the High Church incumbent of St Chad's, later in the year, during a canonical visitation under Thomas Morton, then Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Judith was the wife of George Wright, sometime bailiff of Shrewsbury, and the couple had son, Joshua, baptised on 25 April 1625:Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 47. George Wright was one of the relatively small number accorded the title of Mr. in the register, showing that he was regarded as socially superior to artisans like Daniel Chidley. However, he was cited for allowing meetings to hear sermons and sing hymns in his home on Sunday evenings, and it is known that these were centred on Julines Herring, the town's public preacher, of whom the Wrights were key supporters.Clarke. p. 464. Studley deferred to Morton's judgement: \\"whether Action of gathering together may be termed a conventicle we refer to your honorable court to judge and determine.\\"Coulton, p. 82. Katherine and her husband were also among twenty parishioners presented to the Consistory court for failure to attend church. This may suggest that they had already sought to form a conventicle or separatist group. However, William Rowley, another former bailiff, was cited with them, although he was certainly not a separatist but a leader of the Puritan faction on the corporation and a close supporter of the Presbyterian Herring. Although Studley chose for tactical reasons to conflate them, there seem to have been two distinct Puritan oppositional groups at St Chad's. Herring himself considered the Chidleys separatists and his biographer, Samuel Clarke reports that: \\"When some seeds of separation were scattered in Salop (by Daniel Childey and his wife,) their growth was checked by his appearing against them.\\"Clarke. p. 465. Herring's criticism of them is reported as: :It is a sin of an high nature to unchurch a Nation at once, and that this would become the spring of many other fearful errours, for separation will eat like a Gangrene into the heart of Godlinesse. And he did pray, that they who would un-church others, might not be un- christianed themselves. The Chidleys were distinct from the moderate Presbyterian Puritans in social class as well as theology. However, they continued to have their children christened at St Chad's, which was contrary to the beliefs and practice of convinced separatists. The last baptism of a Chidley child at St Chad's was of John on 26 October 1629,Coulton, p. 83. and the register has a gap where Katherine's name should be.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 68. In order to find like-minded people, and possibly for economic reasons also, the Chidleys were forced to move. It seems that their radicalism was deepened by the experience of living in London and it is possible that it was only in London that they moved decisively to a separatist position. London The Chidley's are shown to have been active in London by 1630 by a manuscript in the collection of Benjamin Stinton,Burrage, volume 2, p. 292. and used by the Baptist historian Thomas Crosby. This records Daniel Chidley helping John Dupper or Duppa and Thomas Dyer to form a separatist church in the capital.Burrage, volume 1, p. 321.Burrage, volume 2, p. 299. This group was a splinter from a church which was organised by Henry Jacob in Southwark before his departure for New England, and later pastored by John Lothropp. The new grouping distinguished itself by rejecting entirely communion or contact with Anglican churches ‚Äì an issue brought to the fore when one member had his child baptised in his local parish church,Burrage, volume 2, p. 301-2. exactly as the Chidleys had previously done. Katherine and Daniel Chidley seem to have been involved in this radical underground resistance to the established Church throughout the 1630s. David Brown, a founder member of the group, implies that they tore a surplice as a deliberate act of iconoclasm one St Luke's Day (18 October) at Greenwich. This was a particularly ungodly place in their eyes because a Catholic chapel had been installed there for Queen Henrietta Maria.Brown (1652), p. 14. Little is known of the group's activities and it is unclear whether such direct action was typical. However, the Chidleys made progress socially and financially after their move to London. Daniel became a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers in 1632,Haberdashers' register of Apprentices and Freemen 1526-1933. and their eldest son, Samuel, was admitted as an apprentice in 1634.Haberdashers' register of Apprentices and Freemen 1526-1933. Controversies with Presbyterians=The Justification of the Independant Churches Katherine's own views were made public for the first time in October 1641, just less than a year into the Long Parliament, which was Charles I was forced to call because of his disastrous handling of the Scottish Presbyterians, culminating in the Bishops' Wars. Chidley's target was Reasons Against the Independent Government of Particular Congregations, an attack on the Congregational polity by the English Presbyterian controversialist Thomas Edwards. The issue was one of great political importance and events were moving generally in the direction Edwards favoured. In negotiations between the Parliament and the Scottish Covenanters, the Scots had gradually but relentlessly pressed the case for a Presbyterian reformation of the Church of EnglandShaw, volume 1, p. 128-9. and had brought along four ministers specifically to combat the Independents: \\"to satisfy the minds of many in England who love the way of New England better than that of Presbyteries used in our Church.\\"Shaw, volume 1, p. 127. Parliament had temporised, committing only to a reformation of the Church \\"in due time as shall best conduce to the glory of God and the peace of the Church,\\" but it was clear that there would be a need for serious concessions to the Scots if hostilities broke out between king and Parliament.Shaw, volume 1, p. 130-1. Chidley's response to the situation was The Justification of the Independant Churches of Christ. Being an Answer to Mr. Edwards his Booke. Edwards had attacked the Independents both for separatism and for what he saw as their unstable and fissiparous structures. In particular, he had no confidence in the ability of ordinary people to judge the value of ministers: :Now how can the people three or foure visible Saints, or more, joyned into a Church, examine and try the learning, gifts, soundnesse of men for the Ministry, who are themselves ignorant in all kind of Learning, and may be weake and injudicious?Reasons against‚Ä¶, p. 6. David with the head of Goliath by Andrea Vaccaro, c.1635. Jael and Sisera by Artemisia Gentileschi, another contemporary of Katherine Chidley. Chidley asked for the reader's indulgence, as she knew she did not have the education and experience of the formidable Edwards: :But though these my Answers are not laid downe in a Schollerlik way, but by the plaine truth of holy Scripture; yet I beseech thee have the patience to take the paynes to reade them, and spare some time to consider them...The Justification of the Independant Churches, Preface, unnumbered page. However, the Biblical quotations she chose were for the title page were highly provocative. The first, , reports the challenge of David to Goliath. The other was , referring to the Jael, who smashed the skull of an enemy of the Israelites.The Justification of the Independant Churches, Title page. Both seem to suggest that the age of power and authority is to give way to one of rule by consent and the reversal of order may be suggesting specifically that monarchy is giving way to one of more diffuse localised, authority.Gillespie, p. 79. She began her response by roundly declaring the lawfulness of separation: :For my owne part, considering that the Church of England is governed by the Canon Lawes (the Discipline of Antichrist) and altogether wanteth the Discipline of Christ, and that the most of them are ignorant what it is, and also doe professe to worship God by a stinted Service-Booke. I hold it not onely lawfull, but also the duty of all those who are informed of such evills, to separate themselves from them, and such as doe adhere unto them; and also to joyne together in the outward profession and practise of Gods true worship, when God hath declared unto them what it is; and being thus informed in their minds of the knowledge of the will of God (by the teaching of his Sonne Jesus Christ) it is their duty to put it in practise, not onely in a Land where they have Toleration, but also where they are forbidden to preach, or teach in the name (or by the power) of the Lord Jesus.The Justification of the Independant Churches, Preface, unnumbered page. She gave vent to considerable bitterness against the clergy of the Church of England, whom she called \\"those Locusts, which ascended out of the bottomlesse pit, .\\" The Justification of the Independant Churches, p. 11. Later in the book she listed the ways in which the Episcopalian clergy exploited the poor, including one which refers to the fee extracted for the churching of women, which she had boycotted in Shrewsbury. :Further, they will yet have another patrimony for the birth of that childe, for before the mother dare goe abroade, shee must have their blessing; that the Sun shall not smite her by day, nor the Moone by night; for which blessing of theirs, they must have an offering, and the like they require for all the children that be borne into this world, though there live not one of sixe to be men or women.The Justification of the Independant Churches, p. 57. However, separation, in her view, was an ecclesiological imperative, rather than a political expedient: :I could not but declare by the testimony of the Scripture it selfe, that the way of Separation is the way of God, who is the author of it, which manifestly appeares by his separating of his Church from the world, and the world from his Church in all ages.The Justification of the Independant Churches, The Answer to Mr Edwards his Introduction, unnumbered page. Edwards had drawn attention to the lack of ministers in the Independent churches and challenged the authority of those they had. Chidley unpicked the ambiguities in his own claim to authority: :And though Mr. Edwards boast himselfe heare, to be a Minister of the Gospell, and a sufferer for it, yet I challenge him, to prove unto me, that he hath any Calling or, Ordination to the Ministry, but that which he hath successively from Rome; If he lay claime to that; he is one of the Popes household; But if he deny that calling, then is he as void of a calling to the worke of the Ministry, and as void of Ordination, as any of those Ministers, whom hee calleth Independant men, (which have cust off the Ordination of the Prelates) and consequently as void of Ordination as a macanicall trades man.The Justification of the Independant Churches, The Answer to Mr Edwards his Introduction, unnumbered page. Chidley was anti-clerical in tone. She renounced the whole idea of apostolic succession in favour of apostolic mission: :Further you alleadge, That if they be ordained, it is by persons who are not in office. Now if you meane, they have no office because they are not elected, ordained and set apart by the Clergie to some serviceable, administration; I pray you tell me who ordained the Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists to their worke or Ministry?The Justification of the Independant Churches, p. 4. Chidley challenged any notion of social superiority or clerical status as a qualification for establishing and governing churches: :Your Question is, Whether it be fitting, that well meaning Christians should be suffered to goe to make Churches? :To this I Answer, It is fitter for well meaning Christians than for ill-meaning Christians, for well-meaning Christians be the fittest on the earth to make Churches, and to choose their Officers; whether they be Taylors, Felt-makers, Button-makers, Tent-makers, Shepherds, or Ploughmen, or what honest Trade soever, if they are well-meaning Christians; but ill-meaning Priests are very unfit men to make Churches; because what they build up with one hand, they pull downe with the other.The Justification of the Independant Churches, p.22-3. Government by elders was common ground between Presbyterians and Independents: : Christ commanded the Apostles to ordaine Elders in every Church by election; therefore the Apostles taught the Churches to ordaine Elders by Election also. However, any superstructure beyond the immediate local level was another matter. Chidley expressed total distrust in any authority not specifically sanctioned by God: :IN your sixth Reason you affirme that the government of the Church by Synods, is no where forbidden by God in the new Testament, either directly, or by consequence. But I doe affirme the contrary, and prove it thus; That whatsoever Government is not commanded by God is accursed, and that is plainely manifested in the New Testament, .The Justification of the Independant Churches, p. 15. Edwards had rejected Toleration as likely to lead to the rising of subordinate groups in society and to social collapse. Chidley, however, championed the people, including the poor: :And that the Church of Christ consisteth of meane persons, is no wonder; for wee have learned, that the poore receive the Gospell, and you know you have granted, that it stands with the light and Law of Nature, That the liberty, power, and rule, should be in the whole, and not in one man or a few; so that the power must rest in the body; and not in the Officers, though the Church be never so poore.The Justification of the Independant Churches, p. 24-5. Where Edwards thought that male householders would lose their authority over wives, children and servants, she argued: :O! that you would consider the text in which plainly declares that the wife may be a beleever, & the husband an unbeleever, but if you have considered this Text. I pray you tell me, what authority this unbeleeving husband hath over the conscience of his beleeving wife; It is true he hath authority over her in bodily and civill respects, but not to be a Lord over her conscience.The Justification of the Independant Churches, p. 26. A New-Yeares-Gift 1646 broadside depicting the two Houses of Parliament and the Westminster Assembly as the Trinity of State. Thomas Goodwin, leader of the five dissident divines attacked by Edwards. Chidley's further contributions to controversy mirrored the developing political and military situation. The onset of the English Civil War forced the House of Commons of England on 6 September 1642 to pledge the abolition of episcopacy and unification with the Church of Scotland,Shaw, volume 1, p. 135-6. although the practical working out of such a scheme was remitted to the Westminster Assembly of Divines. However, series of disasters for the Parliamentarians during 1643 forced acceptance of the Solemn League and Covenant, sworn by both Houses of Parliament on 22 September,Shaw, volume 1, p. 142. committing England to a Presbyterian polity headed by the king. In the last months of 1644, with Parliament's situation increasingly secure, the Assembly of Divines brought forward proposals for the Presbyterian reorganisation, embodied in two reports or advices to Parliament: debate was scheduled for January 1645.Shaw, volume 1, p. 181-3. Chidley recommenced hostilities with Edwards at this point by publishing A New-Yeares-Gift, or a Brief Exhortation to Mr. Thomas Edwards; that he may breake off his old sins, in the old yeare, and begin the New yeare, with new fruits of Love, first to God, and then to his Brethren. This sought to combat damaging claims he had made about the conduct of Independents in Antapologia, an attack on five dissenting members of the Westminster Assembly who were sympathetic to the Independents. Edwards had used smear tactics, seeking to conflate numerous disparate strands of dissent, all of which he claimed were proliferating under the noses of Parliamentarians. :We have seene also by our own experience in this intermysticall season (though there hath been no formall Toleration) yet for want of Government setled, and people having been left to so great libertie, multitudes are fallen, and doe daily to Antinomianisme, Anabaptisme, Independencie, yea to denie the Immortalitie of the Soule, and then no expectation but many will fall more and more: Independents and all kinde of Sectaries (as long as they can have their libertie) snuffe up the wind, will not hearken to any way whereby they may receive satisfaction, but if once the Magistrate declares, and by laws concludes one way of Church-worship and Government, then it may be they will heare Reason...Edwards (1644), p. 291-2. Chidley observed that to answer Edwards was \\"a taske most befitting a woman.\\" Chidley (1645), unnumbered page. She sought to distinguish the Calvinist separatists from other, unrelated sects, including Anabaptists. Chidley (1645), p. 11-22. Against Antinomianism she argued: :But I would have you (& all men) know, that I doe not (neither doe any that are truly religious) plead for such a Toleration, as you would father upon us, even a Toleration to sinne; We plead not for a Toleration of all sorts of persons (who are members of the Church of England,) for that were to plead for a Toleration for Theeves and Murderers, and Adulterers, and Sabbath-breakers, and all sorts of wicked livers, that all men might doe as they list; But the thing wee plead for, is a peaceable enjoyment of our liberty to worship God, publikely, according to his revealed word‚Ä¶ Chidley (1645), p. 16-17. Against the Presbyterians, whom she saw as a new clerical √©lite, she affirmed the supremacy of the Church as a body over its ministry: :Now the Scripture is cleere, that Christ (who is ascended up on high) hath delivered the power to his Church, therefore it is also against the light and law of nature to, to conceive the Church to be thus subordinate to her servants...It is a dishonour unto Christ for them to usurp ecclesiastical authority over her. Chidley (1645), p. 13. At the end of the pamphlet Chidley lambasted Edwards himself: :I have shewed unto you the greatnesse of your sinne, and folly in particular, in making this Antipologia, as well as your former booke: They were both unseasonable, disordered, sinfull and ungrounded vapours; scandalizing the Churches of Christ: There are many untruths in them both, & that not onely where you make naked relations of Tales, but where you make profession before God, and the World, to bring sufficient reasons; when indeede you bring nothing but shadowes and fig-leaves. Chidley (1645), p. 23. Chidley's counterblast to Edwards was probably published on 2 January 1645 and delighted Thomas Goodwin, one of the dissenting divines, who noted that Edwards was \\"baffled by the pen of a woman.\\"Nevitt, p. 27. On the crucial question of setting up elected presbyteries in churches, the Commons voted in the affirmative on 6 January and resolved to inform the Scots of the decision. However, it decided only \\"that many and several congregations may be under one Presbyterial Government,\\" leaving the dispute between Independents and Presbyterians unresolved.Shaw, volume 1, p. 184-5. Chidley was clearly very active in this period, as Robert Baillie, one of the Scottish representatives to the Westminster Assembly, deploring the appearance of female preachers, noted her at work: :...none of the Independents, either in New England or Holland, neither the Brownists of Amsterdam, did ever give unto any women any publike Ecclesiastick power. In this, our London Independents exceed all their Brethren, who of late begin to give unto women power of debating in the face of the Congregation, and of determining Ecclesiastick causes by their suffrages, if Doctor Bastwick be rightly informed. Concerning the power of the Sacraments, Mistris Chidley is permitted to print in defence of the Independent cause, without the reproofe of any of that party, so farre as I have heard, that not only Pastors but private men out of all office, may lawfully celebrate both the Sacraments.Baillie, p. 111. Good Counsell, to the Petitioners for Presbyterian Government By the autumn 1645 the focus of debate was London, where the ministers and authorities were involved in numerous wrangles and difficulties in establishing a Presbyterian system.Shaw, volume 1, p. 200. During this period In November Chidley issued a single-sheet pamphlet under the title Good Counsell, to the Petitioners for Presbyterian Government, That they may declare their Faith before they build their Church.Chidley was particularly critical of the London ministers, whom she condemned for being interested only in :MAINTENANCE and POWER: The one they have as Saul had the fat cattell, contrary to Gods commandment: The other they shall never have: for God will fight against such as fight for them, as it appears at this day: for they by usurped power ever shed the blood of the Saints, and Martyrs of Jesus, and now God is making inquisition for the blood which hath been spilt, and the more fiercely they go on to build up a Babel with blood; the more speedily will God come down to see their wickednes and to confound them.Good Counsell to the Petitioners for Presbyterian Government in David M. Hart (ed). Tracts on Liberty by the Levellers and their Critics Vol. 8. Countering the charge that Independency led to heresy, she pointed to equal likelihood of abuses by a powerful clergy: :Presbyters practise is to preach what they list without controll, therefore errors may be broached by them privilegio. Against this she set the checks implied in democratic control: : And whereas these Presbyterians affirm in their Petition that the Separates set up illeterate men to be their Pastors, let that come to the triall, for we desire not to be led by blind guides. She ended by recommending the Presbyterians to return to apostolic ministry instead of tinkering with structures: : And therefore (in my judgement) it were better for them to make their confession of faith and catechise first, according to the rule of Gods Word, and then shape their Church according to that, rather then shape their Church according to the modell, and their faith according to their Church. Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thy self in the field: and afterwards build thine house. . Despite widespread discontent among Independents, particularly in the Parliamentarian army, Parliament decided in June 1646 to press ahead with a Presbyterian reorganisation of the Church of England.Shaw, volume 2, p. 1. This went ahead at varying rates in London,Shaw, volume 2, p. 2-6. with only eight of the twelve classes represented at the first synod in May 1647. Gangraena First edition of Gangr√¶na. Chidley was one of the separatists denounced by Edwards in his comprehensive denunciation Gangraena, published in three parts during 1646 and 1647, and addressed to Parliament as a \\"Catalogue, or Black Bill of the Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies and Practices of the Sectaries of this time, broached and acted within these four last years in England‚Ä¶\\" Chidley is featured only twice in a very long and rambling book but in one of these Edwards does refer pointedly to the title of his book: Julines Herring, who had died the previous year in Amsterdam, is credited with using the image of gangrene earlier in his references specifically to the Chidleys. Edwards portrays Chidley as bitterly sectarian, narrating an incident he claimed had taken place at Stepney Meeting House, where the moderate Independent William Greenhill was pastor. :Katherine Chidley about August last came to Stepney, (where shee hath drawn away some persons to Brownisme) and was with Mr. Greenhill, where shee with a great deal of violence and bitternesse spake against all Ministers and people that meet in our Churches, and in places where any idolatrous services have been performed: Mr. Greenhill answered her by Scripture, and laboured to reduce to a short head all she had spoke, asking her if this were not the sum, namely, that it was unlawfull to worship God in a place which had been used or set apart to Idolatry, under the Names of Saints and Angels; she would not hold to the stating of the question, but running out, Mr. Greenhill to convince her, told her that all England in this way and manner had been set apart to St. George, and Scotland to Saint Andrew, and so other Kingdomes to other Saints; so that by her grounds it was unlawfull to worship God in these, and so by consequence any where in the world; but instead of being satisfied or giving any answer, shee was so talkative and clamorous, wearying him with her words, that he was glad to goe away, and so left her.Edwards (1646), p. 79-80. Edwards went on to relate the activities of Chidley and her son Samuel in Bury St Edmunds: a passage in which he described her as \\"brasen-faced audacious old woman resembled unto Jael,\\"Edwards (1646), p. 171 apparently using a comparison she had herself put into circulation, although presumably with a different valuation. Missionary activity Katherine and Samuel Chidley were engaged in missionary work in Suffolk during 1647. Thomas Edwards testifies in the later part of Gangraena, compiled that year from readers' reports, that :There is one Katherine Chidly an old Brownist, and her sonne a young Brownist, a pragmaticall fellow, who not content with spreading their poyson in and about London goe down into the Country to gather people to them, and among other places have been this Summer at Bury in Suffolke to set up and gather a Church there... The mission is known also from the extant covenant made by the church they helped found in Bury St Edmunds. The covenant is radically separatist: :and [wee] being conuinced in conscience of the evill of ye Church of England, and of all other states wch are contrary to Christs institution. And being [(according to Christes institutions and comandements)] fully separated, not only from them, but also from those who comunicate with them either publickly or priuately, wee resolve by the grace of God, not to returne unto their vaine inuentions their human deuices, their abominable idolatries, or superstitious high places, which were built and dedicated to idolatry.Bury St Edmund's Church Covenants, p. 334. The community swore \\"to become a peculiar Temple for the Holy Ghoste to dwell in, an entier spouse of Jesus Christ our Lord of glory.\\"Bury St Edmund's Church Covenants, p. 333. Eight adults and six children subscribed, with Katherine and Samuel Chidley signing as witnesses, as compared with the seven converts estimated by Edwards. The key member of the Bury congregation was John Lanseter, who became its first pastor and served until 1654, when he was expelled by his congregation for drunkenness.Bury St Edmund's Church Covenants, p. 335. It seems that the Chidleys issued a pamphlet from Suffolk in response to the criticism of Katherine in the first part. Entitled Lanseter's Launce, Edwards mocked it: \\"as for Laseter's lance for my Gangraena, I shall shew it to be made not of iron or steele but a lance of brown painted paper, fit for children to play with.\\"Gangraena, p. 171-2. Edwards alleged that the Chidleys worked together \\"one inditing, the other writing.\\" Edwards had made clear that the Chidleys' expedition to Suffolk was not unique, and it seems likely that they continued agitating and planting new separatist churches throughout a period of uncertainty. Presbyterian reorganisation was even more patchy in the rest of the country than in London and another ordinance was passed in January 1648, with the aim of removing obstructions to the process.Shaw, volume 2, p. 16. It foundered mainly as a result of opposition from Independents in the increasingly powerful army.Shaw, volume 2, p. 34ff. The irascible Edwards had been forced to leave the country during late summer 1647 and surfaced in the Dutch Republic as a member of the English Reformed Church, Amsterdam: he died there on 7 February 1648. The Second English Civil War, with the abortive invasion of the country by a Scottish army in support of the king, resulted in the final collapse of the attempt to construct a Presbyterian system and the triumph of toleration for the Independents. The Presbytrian structures fell into neglect after 1648, although the remaining active classes continued ordaining ministers throughout the Commonwealth and Protectorate periods.Shaw, volume 2, p. 28. Businesswoman Daniel Chidley became a Master of the Haberdashers' Company in 1649Haberdashers' register of Apprentices and Freemen 1526-1933. but died shortly after. Samuel Chidley became a Freeman of the Company also in 1649.Haberdashers' register of Apprentices and Freemen 1526-1933. Katherine Chidley seems to have continued her husband's business, presumably with her son's help, and became a government contractor. This involved considerable sums. For supplying 4000 pairs of stockings to the army in Ireland she received ¬£250 on 7 November 1651.Calendar of State Papers Domestic Series 1651‚Äì1652, p. 578. On 7 January she was paid a further ¬£104 3s. 4d. for 1000 pairs.Calendar of State Papers Domestic Series 1651‚Äì1652, p. 586. Leveller John Lilburne The Levellers' Manifestation, a pamphlet issued by the four arrested leaders, arguing their case. Praise-God Barebone By this time she had emerged as a leader of Leveller women and seems to have been involved in their petitioning of Parliament. On 29 April 1649 the English Council of State committed to prison the Leveller leaders John Lilburne, Richard Overton, William Walwyn and Thomas Prince, who owned a book critical of the regime, England's New Chains.Whitelock, p. 4. The House of Commons agreed that they should be tried under Common Law on 11 April.Whitelock, p. 12. The House was under a constant bombardment of petitions on behalf of the arrested Levellers, and women mobilised in numbers. On 23 April Bulstrode Whitelocke observed: :Some hundreds of women attended the house with a petition on the behalf of Lilburn and the rest ; it was reproachful, and almost scolding, and much to the same effect with former petitions for them.Whitelock, p. 20. The women were driven off at pistol point,O'Faolain and Martines, p. 268. but returned the next day, although they \\"could not get it received.\\"Whitelock, p. 21. On 25 April they came to parliament for a third time, when: :The house sent them this answer by the sergeant: :That the matter they petitioned about was of an higher concernment than they understood; that the house gave an answer to their husbands, and therefore desired them to go home, and look after their own business, and meddle with their housewifery.Whitelock, p. 22. This patronising answer seems to have provoked their Humble Petitition of divers well-affected women of the Cities of London and Westminster, presented on 5 May 1649, which may have been written by Chidley.Brailsford, p. 317. The Leveller women justified their political activity on the basis of \\"our creation in the image of God, and of an interest in Christ equal unto men, as also of a proportional share in the freedoms of this Commonwealth.\\"The Women's Petition. They went on to ask: :Have we not an equal interest with the men of this Nation, in those liberties and securities contained in the Petition of Right, and the other good laws of the land? Are any of our lives, limbs, liberties or goods to be taken from us more than from men, but by due process of law and conviction of twelve sworn men of the neighborhood? They went on to point out that the arbitrary treatment of the four Levellers implied they too could be \\"liable to the same unjust cruelties as they.\\" Public pressure was probably secured the freedom of the four, as they were not released immediately after acquittal. When John Lilburne found himself on trial again in 1653, Chidley rallied to his defence, organizing a petition to Barebone's Parliament. Edward Hyde, the royalist, was told that it gathered over 6000 female signatures.Calendar of Clarendon State Papers, volume 2, p. 236-7 Hyde heard that \\"the ringleader was the wife of one Chidley, a prime Leveller.\\" She led a delegation of twelve women to present the petition. Praise-God Barebone himself was sent to meet and dissuade the women but his efforts were in vain. Another member was then sent out to tell them that Parliament could not notice the petition, \\"they being women and many of them wives, so that the Law tooke no notice of them.\\" Family Katherine and Daniel Chidley had the following eight children christened at St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury. :* Samuel, 13 April 1618. He was also a Leveller activist.Fraser, p. 247. :* Daniel, 20 August 1620.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 14. He was buried 13 June 1621.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 19. :* Priscilla (Prissella), 22 April 1622.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 23. :* Sarah (Sarra), 11 April 1624.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 34. :* Daniel, 12 February 1626. :* Mary, 25 February 1627.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 52. :* Joseph, 14 September 1628.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 62. :* John, 26 October 1629. Death Nothing further of Chidley is documented after 1653 and her date of death is not known. Reception and reputation Chidley was famous or notorious enough in her own day for important Puritan controversialists like Edwards and Goodwin to take note, although it is arguable that her full significance was overlooked.Nevitt, p. 26. Goodwin, for example, used Chidley's gender to belittle Edwards, but never quoted or referred to her work.Nevitt, p. 28. She remained, however, for more than a century, an author who was known by reputation if not studied. George Ballard, in his 1752 anthology Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain, admitted: :I can trace out but very little concerning this writer; who appears to have been a most violent independent; and to have fought as furiously for that cause, as ever did Penthesilea (the celebrated Amazonian Queen) in defence of the Trojans...Ballard, p. 281. However, he did know and had evidently examined, if not read, The Justification of the Independant Churches, as he describes the volume, although not its arguments. He also knew the report of the Stepney encounter with Greenhill, from the first part of Gangraena, but apparently not the narrative of the Suffolk mission, or anything of her Leveller connections, as he concludes: \\"Whether she wrote any thing more, or what became of her afterwards, I know not.\\"Ballard, p. 282. She apparently merited no entry in the Dictionary of National Biography and only one mention: in the article on her adversary Thomas Edwards. Socialist historians in the 20th century revived interest in the Levellers and the popular historian and journalist H. N. Brailsford mentioned both Katherine and Samuel Chidley several times in his book on the subject, written in the 1950s. Ian Gentles contributed an important article on the Chidleys to The Journal of Ecclesiastical History in 1978, going on the write the article on Katharine for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography in 2004. By this time, she was becoming an important subject for Feminist historians. Katharine Gillespie of Miami University, who has sought to give serious weight to Biblical and theological perspectives, edited a facsimile edition of her writings, published in 2009. Interest is not confined to the Left: Chidley's centrality in discussion of the separation of Church and State has brought her to the attention of the Online Library of Liberty, sponsored by the Right Libertarian Liberty Fund, which is in the process of publishing her main works online.

The tree's generic name means \\"Iron-wood\\" in Greek, referring to its very hard timber. It is one of South Africa's \\"Protected Trees\\" and several specimens are provincial heritage sites. Sideroxylon inerme in Freddie Bosman' site, from the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden. This is the only member of the genus Sideroxylon in southern Africa. Distribution Cape milkwood trees in typical coastal habitat The Sideroxylon inerme trees are scattered through the coastal woodlands and littoral forests of South Africa as far as Zimbabwe. Historically, dense forests of large milkwood trees used to exist along the coast and bays of Cape Town, especially at Noordhoek, Macassar and Gordons Bay. The milkwood is not endangered but it is one of South Africa's Protected Trees, which means that it is illegal to damage, move or destroy them. Description Sideroxylon inerme is a semi-coastal sturdy broadleaf evergreen tree with dense foliage, displays of white bisexual flowers and edible purplish-black berries. It boasts leathery, spiral leaves, which, like the berries, contain milky latex. Young branches and new leaves are always covered with fine hairs. The tree can reach 15 m. The milkwood has considerable value in traditional medicine and attracts birds, monkeys and other animals to its flowers and fruits : Speckled mousebirds eat the flowers ; birds, bats, monkeys and bush pigs eat the fruit. It is also an effective firebreak and is cultivated for that purpose. Subspecies Sideroxylon inerme carries three sub-species : * Sideroxylon inerme cryptophlebium (Baker) J.H.Hemsl., which grows on Aldabra island (Seychelles) ; * Sideroxylon inerme diospyroides (Baker) J.H.Hemsl., whose range extends to Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Mozambique ; * Sideroxylon inerme inerme, in Mozambique and South Africa.Sideroxylon inerme in PROTA4U site, a database and use guide for African plants. Historical aspects The \\"Treaty Tree\\" in Woodstock, Cape Town - in 1890. The white milkwood has great significance in South Africa's heritage, with three specimens proclaimed as provincial heritage sites: *The Post Office Tree in Mossel Bay is believed to be 600 years old. The Post Office tree, which still stands about 1000 feet from Santos Beach, is considered the first (unofficial) post office in South Africa. It was declared a provincial heritage site in 1938 and is marked with a plaque reading: ‚ÄúThis post office tree stands near the fountains where the Portuguese navigators regularly drew water at Aguada de S√£o Bras (now Mossel Bay) from 1488 onwards. In May 1500 P√™ro de Ata√≠de, captain of a homeward bound ship of Pedro Cabral‚Äôs fleet, left a message here which was found on 7 July 1507 by the outward bound ships of Jo√£o da Nova. According to tradition the message was placed in an old shoe and tied to a tree‚Äù. The seven-year-old letter described the loss at sea of four ships from the expedition of Bartolomeu Dias, and warned of hostilities encountered on the Indian coast. In 1962 SAPO, the South African postal service, erected a mail box at the tree in the shape of a shoe, and items posted from there are cancelled with a special stamp. *The Treaty Tree in Woodstock, Cape Town stood next to the house where in 1806 the Batavian Republic (the modern Netherlands) surrendered Cape Town to the British. *The Fingo Milkwood in the Eastern Cape was the location where in 1835 the Fengu people signed a treaty of alliance with the Cape Colony.

Tierra de Campos (\\"Land of Fields\\") is a large historical and natural region or greater comarca that straddles the provinces of Le√≥n, Zamora, Valladolid and Palencia, in Castile and Le√≥n, Spain. It is a vast, desolate plain with practically no relief, except for some wide undulations of the terrain. Originally it was known as \\"Gothic Plains\\" (Campi Gothici or Campi Gothorum), as the area had been settled by Visigoths who fled from Aquitaine Gaul after its conquest by the Franks. It was first mentioned under this name in Codex Vigilanus (Codex Albeldensis), and described as extending \\"from the river Douro, to the Christian Kingdom\\"., page 3, Campos quos dicunt Goticos usque adflumen Dorium eremauit, et xpistianorum regnum extendit Despite the strong identity of its inhabitants, this historical region has not been able to achieve the necessary legal recognition for its administrative development. Therefore, its municipalities have resorted to organizing themselves in a mancomunidad,Mancomunidad de Tierra de Campos the only legal formula that has allowed the region to manage its public municipal resources meaningfully. Palencia is widely considered to be the capital of the Tierra de Campos. Geography Traditional dovecote in Tierra de Campos \\"Tierra de Campos\\" is located on a fertile, elevated plateau with an average height of around , its geography is typical of the Meseta Central. The ground is mostly made up of quite compact clay. The climate is continental with long, cold winters and short, hot summers. Rivers naturally irrigating the area are sparse and traditionally the land in Tierra de Campos has been used for dryland farming. The Channel of Castile, which cuts across this comarca, was developed for transport purposes but developed into an irrigation system. Some of the wetlands in Tierra de Campos, like the Laguna de la Nava de Fuentes and the Lagunas de Villaf√°fila, are important for the ecology of the region.La Tierra de Campos, Patrimonio Natural There are few natural forested areas left. The Tierra de Campos is the place with the highest concentration of bustard in the Iberian Peninsula, and possibly in the world.Proyecto Avutarda - Bustard Project There is no unanimous agreement regarding the precise boundaries of the Tierra de Campos.

According to John Warrack and Ewan West, writing in The Oxford Dictionary of Opera: \\"His voice was clear and vibrant, but he lacked dramatic gifts.\\"Warrack, p. 299. He is now mainly remembered for having created the role of Alfredo Germont in the world premiere of Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata in 1853. Career Graziani was born in Fermo, Italy, into a musical family. Three of his brothers also became professional singers, in particular his younger brother Francesco Graziani, who became a well known baritone and spent much of his career singing for the Royal Italian Opera (Covent Garden) in London. Lodovico studied with Cellini and made his debut in 1845 in Bologna in Carlo Cambiaggio's Don Procopio.Kuhn, p. 285. In 1846 he was heard at the Regio Teatro degli Avvalorati in Livorno as Elvino in Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula. He made his debut at La Scala on 14 August 1847 in the title role of Gaetano Donizetti's Dom S√©bastien. In 1851, at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien's Salle Ventadour in Paris, Graziani sang Gennaro in Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia with Marianna Barbieri-Nini in the title role and Fortini as the Duke of Ferrara.Meyerbeer; Letellier, p. 116. The following season he went to La Fenice in Venice where he was heard as Idreno in Rossini's Semiramide, the Duke of Mantua in Rigoletto, the title role of Verdi's Stiffelio, and in the premieres of several operas by minor Italian composers. In his second season there, on 6 March 1853, he created the role of Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata. The production was poorly received, and Verdi, who was depressed and disappointed, described Graziani's singing as \\"marmoreal\\" and \\"monotonous\\",Warrack, p. 299.Walker, p. 212. although most of the blame for the opera's lack of success was reserved for the baritone Felice Varesi, who sang Giorgio Germont.Budden, pp. 114, 123. Graziani had not been well -- one performance was cancelled because of his indisposition.Budden, p. 124. Later in his career, in other Verdi roles, Graziani was more successful. Graziani returned to the Th√©√¢tre-Italien for the 1854-1855 season to sing Manrico in Verdi's Il trovatore, with the contralto Adelaide Borghi-Mamo as Azucena.Budden, p. 107. Verdi, who was in Paris at the time working on the Op√©ra's production of Les v√™pres siciliennes,Walker, pp. 217-218. was somehow persuaded by the Italien's director Calzado to not only sanction the production, but to help supervise, without a fee. The performances, which introduced the opera to Paris beginning on 23 December 1854,Simeone, p. 196. were successful. (The next year Verdi sued the company for mounting productions of La traviata and Rigoletto with unauthorized material, but lost the case.) Graziani returned to La Scala in 1855 in Giuseppe Apolloni's L'ebreo, and in 1862 performed there as Riccardo in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera. Other Verdi roles at La Scala included the Duke of Mantua in Rigoletto and Enrico (Henri) in Giovanna de Guzman (the name used for the first Italian version of Les v√™pres siciliennes).Forbes, Elizabeth. \\"Graziani, Lodovico\\" in Sadie (1992) 2: 523. He sang the title role in Donizetti's Dom S√©bastien at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples in 1856, and the role of Vasco da Gama in the first Italian performance of Meyerbeer's L'Africaine in Bologna in 1865. He also performed in Vienna (1860). Graziani had also been a keen amateur chess player. He studied the game with Jean-Louis Preti and once played Paul Morphy after which he reportedly said: \\"If anybody asks me if I understand chess, I shall say, 'Oh, yes; I play sometimes with Mr. Morphy.'\\"Edge, p. 174 Graziani died in Fermo. Brothers Lodovico Graziani's three brothers who became professional singers were: Giuseppe (1819-1905), a bass; Francesco (1828-1901), a baritone; and Vincenzo (1836-1906), also a baritone.

The creek forms the boundary between northwestern Santa Clara County and southeastern San Mateo County. History High winter flows in Los Trancos Creek are diverted by Stanford's Lagunitas Diversion Dam just downstream from Rossotti's to Felt Lake. The lake is actually a reservoir that lies west of Interstate 280 and bounded by Alpine Road and the Pearson Arastradero Preserve on Arastradero Road. Felt Lake was constructed in 1876 by gold miner and lumber dealer Job Johnston Felt, who bought 700 acres in northern Santa Clara County to farm. It was his dream to build two water companies, San Francisquito and Los Trancos. Felt built the original diversion from Los Trancos Creek to Felt Lake. By the mid-1880s, and facing opposition to his plans, the elderly Felt abandoned the water company idea and sold the farm to Timothy Paige, who quickly sold it to Leland Stanford Sr. in 1887. The university later added a larger dam to hold irrigation water for the growing campus.? Watershed Los Trancos Creek drains an area of about and consists of about of channel. Its headwaters are protected by the Los Trancos Open Space Preserve just northwest of Page Mill Road. Buckeye Creek is a small tributary that enters from the east with origins in Palo Alto Foohills Park, including Boronda Reservoir. Felt Creek is another small ephemeral tributary which begins in the Pearson-Arastradero Preserve, then passes north under Arastradero Road where it was dammed to create Felt Lake. The Felt Lake Diversion ditch begins at the intersection of Arastradero and Alpine Roads and diverts high winter Los Trancos Creek flows to join Felt Creek before the latter enters Felt Lake. Below the reservoir, Felt Creek rejoins Los Trancos Creek just north of Interstate 280. Of interest, Felt Creek may have historically joined Los Trancos Creek just north of Arastradero Road on the 1876 Thompson & West map of Santa Clara County. The next watershed to the west is Corte Madera Creek, another tributary of San Francisquito Creek. The confluence of Los Trancos Creek with San Francisquito Creek occurs just below Piers Lane Road (between Interstate 280 and the Stanford Golf Course) in a small residential island of land belonging to Menlo Park within Stanford's lands. Ecology A Fish ladder on Los Trancos Creek constructed by Stanford University in 2009 enables steelhead trout to pass the Felt Lake Diversion Dam. In 1929 Stanford installed a diversion dam on Los Trancos Creek to its Felt Lake water storage reservoir. The dam, located just below the intersection of Arastradero and Alpine Roads, blocked access of anadromous steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to over of pristine upstream spawning grounds. In 2009, Stanford University completed construction of a new fish screen and ladder as the previous fish ladder was an \\"Alaska Steep Pass\\" designed for much higher flows. The upper watershed is wholly protected within the Los Trancos Open Space Preserve just northwest of Page Mill Road and east of Skyline Boulevard. Spawning steelhead in Los Trancos Creek below the Felt Lake diversion dam vary from zero in drought years to several hundreds in wetter years and occurs from February to April. Steelhead spend two years in freshwater before heading to the Bay and field studies in the Stanford portion of Los Trancos Creek have found hundreds of young trout ranging from ~140 per mile to nearly 600 per mile. From 2016 through 2020, a pair of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) has nested in a large eucalyptus tree near Felt Lake and the Pearson-Arastradero Preserve. Hiking Excellent hiking from the Piers Lane parking area on Alpine Road crosses over San Franciscquito Creek and Los Trancos Creek just above their confluence and proceeds to the Stanford Dish.

It is closely related to African mancalas such as Bao (Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya), Njomba (Mozambique and Malawi), Lela (DR Congo), Mulabalaba (Zambia), Muvalavala (Angola) and Tschuba (South Africa, Mozambique). Rules (Oman) Hawalis boards in Oman are composed by 4 rows of 7 holes. At game setup, two seeds are placed in each hole. Each player owns half of the board (2 rows) of the board. At his or her turn, the player takes all seeds from a hole and relay-sows them counterclockwise. If there are holes with more than one seed, then the player must sow starting from one such hole. If the last seeds fall in a hole of the inner row and the opposite hole in the opponent's half board is not empty, its contents are captured and removed from the game. If both the opposite hole and that behind it in the opponent's half board are non empty, all seeds are captured from both of them. The game ends when one of the players is left without any seed in his rows. The winner of the game is the player who captures most seeds. Rules (Zanzibar) The rules of Bao la Kiarabu were originally transcribed by W. H. Ingrams, who described two variants of the game. One of them is exactly the same as Oman's Hawalis. The other one uses a different board, with 2 rows of 8 holes each (the same board used for Bao). This also differs from Hawalis in that sowing goes clockwise, and that seeds from a hole in the outer row are captured even if the corresponding hole in the inner row is empty.

Conceived in 2007 by Mei Tayengco, Pat Tirano and Pauline Diaz, the group was named TOI in acknowledgement of Tayengco‚Äôs vision of the group as ‚Äúa plaything created by three minds.‚Äù Tirano and Diaz form the musical core of the band, with numerous other musicians contributing to the band's sound over the years, while Tayengco serves as the band's artistic manager of sorts. History TOI was born in 2007 when interior designer and visual artist Mei Tayengco took up the idea of introducing singer Pauline Diaz to guitarist Patrick Tirano, to see if their musical approaches were compatible. At that point, Diaz was already a writer and television show host and Tirano was already a sound engineer and producer at Wombworks Recording Studio in Marikina, and was already doing gigs with other bands.http://toiband.multiply.com/ Diaz recounts: :‚ÄúWe did a test pair-up just to see how it fit, and what came out was a bunch of songs I had written with a whole new depth of sound coming from Pat. It was a pretty cool day.‚Äù The duo started performing their music in the Philippine independent music scene, playing stages like Route 196, Mag:Net Cafe, Saguijo, and 70‚Äôs Bistro, earning acclaim for music the Manila Times' Gabrielle De La Rama-Talan described in mid-2008 as \\"a compelling, strange and heady mix of blues and jazz.\\" Later that year, bassist Miks Bersales and drummer Archie Asistores of Salamin, another Filipino indie act,http://www.manilagenesis.com/comingsoon/news/30/salamin-launches-self- titled-debut-album were recruited to play regularly with TOI. The two came to be known as \\"The Goonies\\", differentiating them from TOI's core group of Tirano and Diaz. The foursome recorded a live album at Wombworks which they called \\"Toi and The Goonies Live @ The Womb\\". The band distributed the album through personal contacts, and then made it available for download, also putting up videos of the sessions up on YouTube.http://toikingdom.com 2009 and 2010 saw a period of renewed writing and recording for group, and with Asistores and Bersales moving on, new performers joined the TOI lineup. These included Rommel Sanchez backing Tirano up on Guitar, Razorback's Louie Talan on bass, and Pupil's Wendell Garcia on Drums, a supporting lineup that the band has referred to as \\"The Dream Team.\\" 2010 saw the release of an E.P., \\"Jack\\", featuring songs for which the band had become known, such as \\"Demon\\", \\"Armor\\", and the eponymous title track \\"Jack.\\" It also included a cover of Radiohead's \\"Creep.\\" By September of that year the band had released a full- album of sorts called \\"The Rehearsal,\\" compiling demo material from earlier recordings. \\"Demon\\" began getting heavy airplay on prominent Rock radio station NU107. On September 25, 2010, the band topbilled a show of their own, also called \\"The Rehearsal\\" at Route 196, which the band indicated was a harbinger of bigger things for the band. Playing with the name of the name of the show, Tirano noted that \\"this is just The Rehearsal...\\" TOI as an indie band While the group hasn't dismissed the idea of signing up with a label, the band has always embraced its indie status. With all the members - particularly Tirano who is deeply involved in numerous music projects - busy, the members see the band as a more laid-back musical experiment. ‚ÄúWe just like what we do,\\" Tirano said in an interview with Fully Booked Magazine, \\"keeping the music in our heads until it naturally spills out.‚Äù Diaz adds that \\"TOI and our collaboration with other artists was never perceived as work, we have our day jobs for that.\\" They also point out that it contributes to the quality of their music, and of their performances. Diaz says that it plays \\"a [big] part in helping us explore our sound,\\" and further says \\"‚ÄúYou have to mess around with your own stuff, including the band name, before you unleash anything on the world.‚Äù The band points out that even the origin of the band's name is a reminder that the point of putting up a musical group is to play - as Tirano puts it, \\"to toi around.\\" Members=Founding Members * Pat Tirano - Guitar * Pauline Diaz - Vocals * Mei Tayengco - Management Other Members Current * Romel \\"Sancho\\" Sanchez - Guitar * Louie Talan - Bass * Wendell Garcia - Drums * DJ Rodriguez - Percussion Former/Sessionists * Miks Bersales - Bass * Archie Asistores - Drums * Eo Marcos - Drums  External links  * Official website - http://toikingdom.com * Multiply site - http://toiband.multiply.com/ * Facebook page  References  Category:Filipino rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 2007 ","title":"Toi (band)"},{"id":"29201775","text":"The 1976 Japan Open Tennis Championships was a tennis tournament played on hard courts and part of the 1976 Commercial Union Assurance Grand Prix circuit.

Retrieved: 27 April 2012. Mr. Proudfoot Shows a Light was commissioned by the Ministry of Information and was designed to emphasise, in a humorous manner, the need for absolute adherence to wartime blackout regulations. A secondary consideration of the production was to present information in a way that would relieve the stress of civilians coping with nightly bombing raids in the Blitz. Plot Mr. Proudfoot (Sydney Howard ) is an attention-seeking bore who subjects his long- suffering wife (Muriel George) and exasperated acquaintances to endless tall tales about narrow escapes from bombs. He also teases the local blackout warden for his ridiculous pettiness when it comes to enforcing blackout restrictions. One night Mr. Proudfoot invites a friend (Wylie Watson) over for a late night game of billiards, but is careless about his blackout. After moving the blackout screen over to let in some air, the light showing from his home provides a target for a stray German bomber. The German crew had been struggling with inclement weather and were unable to get their bearings until they see the light below, which, after some calculations, indicates they are over London. Having unloaded a bomb over Mr. Proudfoot's district, and even hitting his house with calamitous results, the Luftwaffe bomber is shot down by RAF Hawker Hurricane fighters. Under interrogation, one of the German crew states that they were guided to their target by a light blazing from a property that allowed them to plot out an attack. Despite his injuries, Mr. Proudfoot appears at his local pub bandaged and bruised, but is still boasting to anyone who will listen about his latest brush with death.

The Bara are the largest of the island's zebu-herding peoples and have historically lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle, although an increasing proportion are practicing agriculture. Bara society is highly patriarchal and endogamy and polygamy are practiced among some Bara tribes. Young men practice cattle rustling to prove their manhood before marriage, and the kilalaky musical and dance tradition associated with cattle rustlers has gained popularity across the island. Historically the Bara were organized into numerous affiliated kingdoms ruled by nobles of the Zafimanely line. They were largely united under a single king in the late 18th century before again dissolving into competing kingdoms. Over the 19th century, Bara participation in slave and cattle trading and raids into neighboring territories saw their wealth and power increase despite the group's fragmented political organization. This economic power enabled the Bara to maintain independence from the expanding authority of the Kingdom of Imerina and resist French authority for nearly a decade following colonization in 1896. Andre Resampa, a powerful political leader in the transition to independence for Madagascar in 1960, hailed from the Bara ethnic group. There were an estimated 520,000 Bara in Madagascar in 2000 constituting roughly three percent of the population, and they remain the island's predominant zebu herders and traders. Ethnic identity Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups The name Bara is of Bantu origin and means \\"those of the interior\\". Along with Sakalava, Bara are one of the two Malagasy ethnic groups of clear Bantu descent. They live principally in the southern part of the central plateaus of Madagascar, in the Toliara Province, especially in the Ihosy-Betroka area. They numbered an estimated 520,000 in 2000. History The history of the Bara begins along the Ihosy River in the Arindrano region of southwest Madagascar, near Toliara. Little is known about the earliest period in Bara identity formation, beyond that it coincided with the formation of the Maroserana dynasty of the Sakalava people and that certain Bara nobles had Maroserana origins. This early kingship-based social structure is believed to have had weak or nonexistent rules of succession. Around 1640 a noble of the Mahafaly people invaded Bara territory and installed his family as rulers under the dynastic name Zafimanely. This was an imposition to which many Bara were unwilling to submit, leading them to simply migrate internally to new territory. Zafimanely power became more firmly established after the death of the Mahafaly nobleman in 1653, but competition and ambition led these newcomers to engage in an ongoing struggle for power until around 1680, greatly disrupting life in Bara territory (Ibara). A major driver of this instability was the absence of a tribute system, leading Zafimanely nobles to engage in cattle raiding and issuing costly fines to law breakers that sparked internal and external tensions alike. Around 1800 there emerged a Zafimanely king called Raikitroka who put in place new regulations that greatly eased these tensions and ushered in a reign of relative tranquility and harmony. After Raikitroka's death, the ruling line fractured into multiple kingdoms and principalities; by 1895 the Bara were organized into at least three major kingdoms, two mid-sized ones and more than 24 minor kingdoms. This shift was linked not to economic causes‚Äîthe Bara as a whole grew richer from international trade and the raiding of Imerina in the late 19th century‚Äîbut rather because of the gradual dispersal of the growing Bara population into the relatively underpopulated plains of the west and south and subsequently growing distance of the scattered population from the traditional center of Bara power. Although Queen Ranavalona I successfully established a Merina military installation at Ihosy, the 19th century military conquests of the Kingdom of Imerina never succeeded in entirely subjugating the Bara. Working from their base at Ihosy, the Merina garrison attempted to exert some degree of influence over the Bara by providing support to stronger Bara kings over their challengers in an effort to maintain friendly alliances with powerful leaders capable of exerting the control over the territory that the Merina could not. Despite the dispersed nature of Bara power, by the end of the 19th century the Zafimanely constellation of ruling nobles ranked alongside that of the Sakalava and Merina as the most powerful political forces on the island. The Zafimanely Kingdom was dissolved after the island was colonized by the French in 1896. The king of one of the most prominent Bara kingdoms, a leader named Ramieba, was arrested by the French for leading Bara participation in the Menalamba rebellion against French rule in 1897. This consequently soured Bara perception of the French, who otherwise might have been welcomed as conquerors of the widely resented Merina sovereigns. After the French conquered Madagascar they attempted with great difficulty to impose administrative authority in Bara territory, with frequent Bara insurrections between June 1897 and the general southern uprising of 1904‚Äì05. Bara politician Andre Resampa became a leading figure in the establishment of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) in the run-up to national independence in 1960. When PSD figurehead Philibert Tsiranana was elected Madagascar's first president on 1 May 1959, Resampa became the party's Secretary General; in this role, he spearheaded the revival of the traditional body of local government, the fokonolona, and led a successful effort to dramatically increase party membership. Society Bara society is structured into numerous loosely affiliated groups based on common ancestors. These were clustered into five main tribes. The three largest and most powerful were the Bara-Be, Bara- Imamono and Bara-Ianstsantsa, who lived alongside the smaller Vinda and Antivondro. They live a semi-nomadic lifestyle that revolves around herding zebu and are the largest and most important of the Malagasy pastoralist groups. The capital of the Bara was located in Ihosy. Community life was traditionally organized around a rigid set of rules and norms, but these have loosened since the early 20th century as growing population pressures have forced emigration and dispersal of the Bara away from their historic homeland. Like elsewhere in Madagascar, Bara society was historically stratified into three classes: nobles, commoners and slaves. Communities remain strongly patriarchal, and polygamy is commonly practiced. Endogamy is also practiced among some Bara tribes. The male head of the family often has a dual role as the spiritual leader of the household. Traditionally, inheritance rights strongly favored males; daughters were restricted from inheriting anything other than movable property. Gender roles were strictly defined. Men prepared the soil of the rice fields, purchased or hunted for food, gathered firewood, built the family home and furniture, and engaged in discussion and debate about public affairs. Women were responsible for growing crops for sale or family consumption, weeding the rice fields, harvesting and processing the rice, gathering water, lighting the hearth fire and preparing daily meals, and weaving. As recently as the late 19th century, women were forbidden from eating until after the men had finished, and could not look at them while they ate. At birth, a village ombiasy (seer) was typically consulted to determine whether the child was destined for a fortunate or unhappy fate. If the latter, an exorcism was practiced whereby the infant would be slid down a chute into a body of water where his mother would retrieve him, and if it was deemed that the evil destiny was too strong for the exorcism rite to overcome it, the Bara infant would be left on an anthill to die. Religious affiliation While some Baras are Christians, most retain their traditional religious beliefs. Tamarind trees were traditionally considered sacred and are found planted near many Bara villages, where residents will leave offerings like woven mats, locks of hair, shells and other items when offering prayers or after their requests are fulfilled. The indigenous bontona tree was also considered sacred and villagers would tie charms to the branches when offering prayers. Each village also had a hazomanga, a wooden pillar considered the most sacred site of worship, which served as the public altar for group prayer and offerings. This pillar was typically 20 to 30 feet high and a sachet containing sacred herbs, sand and wood chips was hung from the top. Bara men traditionally conduct the rites associated with honoring the ancestors, while women conduct rites associated with fertility and the forces of nature. An exception is childbirth, during which the mother is secluded for a period of four days; men watch over the birthing process and conduct associated rites. Culture Agreements were traditionally formalized through a blood pact (fatidra). The Bara live in rectangular earthen houses that are colored red by the high iron content of the soil. In the winter, space beneath the eaves is used for hanging and sun-drying maize to be stored, sold or planted the following year. Demonstrating courage is fundamental to masculinity in Bara culture. Historically, kings were required to lead the advance in combat, placing themselves in danger first; the others were not allowed to protect him or come to his aid unless he was injured or exhausted. Cattle raiding is a major feature of Bara culture. Traditionally a rite of passage for young men to prove their worth and courage to a prospective wife's family and the larger community, the practice is currently outlawed but remains widespread throughout the southwest and south-central Bara territories. Young men could not expect to marry respectably without first having successfully stolen at least one or two cattle in a raid. Today, cattle rustlers (dahalo) are increasingly armed bandits stealing cattle for wealth rather than social prestige. Zebu wrestling is a sport practiced by Bara communities and involves Zebu being penned into an arena and whipped into frustration. Once the zebu is angry, players sneak up behind the Zebu and jump onto its hump, attempting to 'ride' as long as possible without being injured by the beast. It is seen as a rite of passage for young boys. The Bara have a rich oral storytelling tradition. Their myths and stories are distinguished by an especially stark and terse use of language. The comparatively simple structure and symbolism that predominates in Bara storytelling is used by some linguists and anthropologists as a starting point for analyzing the evolution and variation of oral storytelling traditions on the island. The dance traditions and sculpted artwork of the Bara are well known across the island. Their wooden statues are unique in having long eyelashes made from real hair. Traditionally, Bara women would weave local cotton to make clothing for themselves and their family members. Cotton continues to be hand picked, ginned and woven using a high-whorl drop spindle. Raw cotton yarn is typically dipped in a softening solution before weaving; prior to softening, the yarn is called fole velo (\\"living yarn\\") and is believed to be imbued with magical powers; ombiasy (village wisemen) may tie this yarn around the wrist for protection or wrap it around the bodies of participants in circumcision ceremonies. Less commonly, clothing was made of silk (landy) produced by the local silkworm that fed off indigenous tapia trees growing in the Isalo area. Although this silk was more coarse and uneven than that produced by the Merina or Betsileo people, throughout the island it was the most prized type of silk because of its durability. In the far eastern part of Bara territory, clothing was most commonly made from beaten bark cloth or mats of harefo (Eleocharis plantagines). Women wore tube dresses made of two to three mats stitched together and tied at the shoulder or belted at the waist, often in combination with a bandeau style top of woven mahampy reeds. Men wore beaten bark cloth loincloths with jackets or tunics formed from stitched woven mats; older men's clothing included sleeves. The wearing of charms is common among the Bara, as elsewhere in Madagascar; charms called tsimokotra were historically crafted from the bones of lemurs' feet to relieve fatigue. Fady As elsewhere in Madagascar, social life among the Bara is strongly guided by fady, ancestral taboos that often vary by class, by village, or even by family. In some Bara villages, it is forbidden to carry a load alone; at least two people must carry it together. A common prohibition throughout Bara communities forbids serving food or drink to someone with the utensils, plates or cups that were used to serve another. It is also fady to step over someone seated or lying on the ground, lift or carry an item over another person's head or body, brush another person with one's lamba, or sit on or lean against another's bed. Numerous fady surround the Bara nobles. Among the Zafimanely royal clan, for example, it is forbidden to ever kill a relative, even as punishment for a serious crime. Historically it was taboo to speak to the wives of chiefs or enter their houses, and there were specific locations restricted to everyone but them for gathering firewood and collecting water. A particularly strong taboo forbade speaking the name of a chief after his death or any word that formed part of the name. The deceased leader was given a new name after death that all were required to use, and specific synonyms were selected to replace the words composing his name for use in regular conversation; anyone who spoke the forbidden words would harshly punished or in some instances executed. Funeral rites Bara burial site, Isalo national park The Bara entomb the dead in natural mountain caves, particularly in Isalo National Park, an area they consider sacred; they have buried their dead in the caves here for centuries. Where such natural formations are not available, the Bara build tombs covered in stones at a site away from the village. Mourners visit the bereaved in a special building called the \\"house of many tears\\" where the women engage in ritual wailing and expression of sorrow. The bereaved family members cut their hair to express mourning. Among many Bara, wives were not buried with their husband and his children, but were rather buried with their father or in a separate site. It is believed that the spirits of the dead linger as ghosts, which historically prompted villages to relocate after a death. Those associated with a recent death are seen as imbued with a kind of contagion for a short period of time. When bilo or salamanga healing rituals are being conducted, the ombiasy may erect a special barrier (kiady) in front of the entrance to the house where the ceremony is being held as an indicator that anyone whose family member has recently died (as well as any foreigner or stranger outside the community) is forbidden to enter for concern about breaking the power of the healing spell. Dance and music Dance among the Bara is influenced by the movement of the zebu they have traditionally herded for centuries. The karitaky dance in particular is a movement inspired by a zebu kicking. The most popular contemporary dance, called kilalaky, is performed in a line and originated among Bara cattle rustlers. The specific style of musical accompaniment, also known as kilalaky, is performed on djembe, kabosy, electric guitar, bass guitar, drum kit and keyboard. Bagzana and Tsiliva are considered among the most popular performers of kilalaky. The most typical musical instrument among the Bara is the lokanga, a fiddle with three strings made of goat gut or vegetable fiber. Language The Bara speak Bara Malagasy, a dialect of the Malagasy language, which is a branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages, spoken in southern Borneo. Economy Raising and selling herds of zebu is the principal economic activity of the Bara. In recent decades they have increasingly adopted agricultural practices, including the cultivation of rice, cassava, millet and maize. The rice planting season was traditionally timed around the arrival of a local migrating quail (coturnix communis), known locally as kibodolo. The Bara and Sakalava were Madagascar's principal international slave traders through the early part of the 19th century. Historically the majority of slave raids were conducted in the dry winter months. Beginning in the 1870s, in response to increased cattle demand in South Africa following a series of blights and disease that had decimated local herds, the Bara began exporting their cattle internationally through southern coastal ports including Toliara, Saint Augustin, Belo and Soalara. The development of economic activity independent of the regulation of the Kingdom of Imerina, as well as the arms they received in exchange for cattle, enabled the Bara to strengthen their autonomy and resist Merina authority in the later 19th century, even to the extent of launching cattle and slave raids into the heart of Imerina - an activity that increased particularly after 1882. The Ankandrarezina Bara also cultivated tapia, a mulberry upon which the indigenous silkworm fed; the silk they produced was both woven locally for cloth and exported in raw form to Imerina.

Biography According to Arnold Houbraken he was a light-hearted poet from Haarlem. Reinier Brakenburg in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He was the pupil of Hendrik Mommers who went on to paint clever genre scenes in the manner of Adriaen van Ostade. Though some said he was the pupil of Bernard Schendel, they were the same age and painted in similar styles. He was successful enough at his art that his Frisian widow was able to purchase an annuity after his death in Friesland. According to the RKD he is registered in Leeuwarden during the years 1670-1687.Richard Brakenburgh in the RKD He is known for both Italianate landscapes and portraits. He painted similar subjects to those of Schendel, representing merry-makings and drunken assemblies. His pictures are ingeniously composed, and well coloured, something in the manner of Adriaen van Ostade, though greatly inferior. They are painted with facility, although they have the appearance of being very highly finished; and he perfectly understood the management of chiaroscuro. His greatest defect is his incorrect drawing of the figure, which he appears not to have studied from nature. The Vienna Gallery has two 'Peasant Scenes' by him, said to have been painted in 1690; the Berlin Museum one, and the Amsterdam Gallery one. In the Brussels Gallery is a 'Children's Feast,' signed and dated 1698; and the Rotterdam Museum has a 'Doctor's Visit,' signed and dated 1696. In Windsor Castle are two good 'Artists' Studios ' by him. He also sometimes practised the art of engraving. He was the teacher of Wigerus Vitringa, Abraham Pardanus, and Gillis de Winter. He was a follower of Jan Steen. He died at Haarlem in December 1702 and was buried in January 1703. Gallery File:Boerenherberg. Rijksmuseum SK-A-55.jpegCounty Inn, Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.

Sayers published between November 1939 and January 1940 in The Spectator. They had the form of letters exchanged by members of the Wimsey family and other characters familiar to readers of the Lord Peter Wimsey detective novels; but the articles were intended to convey Sayers's opinions and commentaries on various aspects of public life in the early months of the Second World War. Content The topics covered include such matters as blackout, evacuation, rationing and the need for the public to take personal responsibility rather than wait for the government to guide them. The subjects range from very practical and detailed advice ranging from such issues as how pedestrians can avoid being hit by cars in the blackout to quite Utopian and far-reaching schemes for the post-war reconstruction of Britain. The letters also expressed Sayers's displeasure with the appeasement policies of Neville Chamberlain in the previous years, and her doubts about his fitness to lead Britain in war (at the time of writing, it was not yet known that Chamberlain would soon be replaced by Winston Churchill). The papers also attributed to Harriet Vane a reluctance to go on writing murder mysteries at the time when European dictators were committing mass murders openly and with impunity. This seems to have been Sayers's own feeling, as she in fact abandoned during World War II the writing of murder mysteries and never took it up again. There is a repeated unfavorable opinion of the Soviet Union, in the aftermath of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and the Soviet attack on Finland. The opinion that there was little to choose between communism and fascism, and that the two kinds of dictatorship are equally reprehensible, is given special prominence by being attributed to Lord Peter Wimsey himself. Other characters are shown as expressing the opinion that, even had Britain managed to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union in 1939, the Soviets would have proven an unreliable ally of little military worth, given their army's weak performance in Finland. On this point Sayers' opinion, like that of most other Britons, did not change in 1941. Getting the Soviets on Britain's side was highly welcome, but the lamentable performance and mass surrenders of the Red Army seemed to bear out the negative assessment. It was only in 1942, when the Germans lost an Army at Stalingrad and American supplies started flowing in, that the resiliency and true strength of Russia became apparent. The papers do provide some significant new details about Wimsey's character, in particular the ironic epitaph he writes for himself when setting out for a dangerous mission behind enemy lines: Here lies an anachronism in the vague expectation of eternity. They also show that in addition to his thorough knowledge of the classics of English literature, Wimsey is familiar ‚Äì though in fundamental disagreement ‚Äì with the works of Karl Marx, and well able to debate with Marxists on their home ground. Later reuse Some of the letters included in The Wimsey Papers were used by Jill Paton Walsh as the preface for her own novel \\"A Presumption of Death\\", an authorized sequel continuing the Wimsey series where Sayers left it off. The letters provided much information which Walsh used in the book: Peter Wimsey and his servant Bunter being on a secret mission abroad, Harriet Vane taking her own children and those of her sister- in-law Mary to the country house Talboys in Hertfordshire, Peter's nephew Jerry an RAF combat pilot, and the unsympathetic Duchess Helen working at the Ministry of Instruction and Morale (about whose work Sayers was rather disparaging). The village dance and air raid practice, which are the starting point for the plot of A Presumption of Death, are also derived from one of Sayers' fictional letters, though the idea of making this the scene of a murder to be investigated was Walsh's. Availability Other than the selection made by Walsh and incorporated in her book, The Wimsey Papers have never been republished. In the Author's Note appended to A Presumption of Death, Walsh cautioned the eager Wimsey fans that \\"The Wimsey Papers are not fiction, and were not intended to be read in a continuous chunk\\" and that \\"Some of them are about details of war-time history that would now require extensive footnotes in explication\\". Nevertheless, one such fan made the effort to retype them from archive copies of The Spectator and make them available online (see External Links). \\"The Wimsey Papers\\" are now available as a Kindle ebook from Amazon.

It was written by co-executive producer Matt Hubbard and directed by Todd Holland. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on October 21, 2010. Guest stars in this episode include Kelsey Grammer, Seth Kirschner, and Jen Ponton. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is succeeding at all of his tasks, and as a result of having a good day, as he is on a roll, he decides to help Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) figure out her relationship status with Carol (Matt Damon). Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) enlist the help of actor Kelsey Grammer to help them pull off a scam, and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tries to film a commercial for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. \\"Reaganing\\" was generally, though not universally, well received among television critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by 5.182 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.2 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. For his work in this episode, Matt Hubbard received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series. Plot Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) agrees to give sketch show TGS with Tracy Jordan head writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) a ride to Newark Liberty International Airport to meet her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). On the way, she tells him that she is having intimacy issues with Carol and wants to end the relationship. Jack, who is having a successful run of problem-solving, encourages Liz to confide in him so that he can help solve her problem. She tells him of a traumatic incident from her childhood when, preparing to use the bathroom whilst wearing roller skates, she pulled down her underpants and fell, pulling a Tom Jones poster on top of her. Her mother (Anita Gillette) discovered Liz under the poster and suspected her of masturbating, so she took all her posters away. With their limousine stuck in traffic, Jack exits the vehicle to try to digest Liz's story. At the same time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tries to film a commercial for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America but has a difficult time remembering his line resulting in production holding traffic up as the commercial shoot is blocking off a street. Jack comes upon the scene and realizes the problem. To speed things up, he gives Tracy jelly beans to eat and while he is chewing, Jack imitates Tracy's voice and says the line Tracy was scheduled to say. Back in the car, Jack begins to lose confidence in his problem-solving abilities because Liz still wants to break up with Carol. As they talk through Liz's past problems with sex, they realize that they are all connected to the incident with the Tom Jones poster and that each time she has had a problem, it is because she has been reminded of the singer. Liz is relieved that she has found the root of her problem and Jack convinces her to stay with Carol. When they finally reach Newark Airport, Liz realizes that she is supposed to meet him at John F. Kennedy International Airport instead. Meanwhile, TGS star Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) receives a card from Carvel that entitles her to free ice cream cakes for life. She gets a free cake with the card but it has a mistake in the decoration so NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) returns it to the restaurant. When he gets a refund for the free cake, Jenna decides to scam the restaurant. With Kenneth's help, she orders several more cakes and gets refunds for them. Eventually Jenna is banned from Carvel. The two then enlist actor Kelsey Grammer to assist them in a bigger scam. Jenna and Kenneth submit a sketch to TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) in Liz's name that requires dozens of cakes. Grammer orders the cakes and later gets refunds for all of them. The gang has now collected money from both TGS and Carvel for 21 free cakes, a windfall of nearly 800 dollars. Kenneth runs into one of the Carvel employees (Jen Ponton) and learns that she was fired because of the scam. Realizing the negative effect of their actions, Kenneth decides not to take part in the scams anymore. Production Kelsey Grammer guest starred as himself in this episode. \\"Reaganing\\" was written by co-executive producer Matt Hubbard, his first episode for the fifth season, and his eleventh writing credit after \\"The Rural Juror\\", \\"Hard Ball\\", \\"The Collection\\", \\"MILF Island\\", \\"Reunion\\", \\"Larry King\\", \\"Cutbacks\\", \\"Audition Day\\", \\"Anna Howard Shaw Day\\", and \\"Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land\\". The episode was directed by Todd Holland, making it his second for the series after directing the February 5, 2009, episode \\"Generalissimo\\" from the show's third season. This episode of 30 Rock originally aired in the United States on October 21, 2010, on NBC as the fifth episode of the show's fifth season and the 85th overall episode of the series. \\"Reaganing\\" was filmed on September 14, and September 20, 2010. Save Picture as ‚Üí Right click file ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Date Picture Taken Co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock said that the upcoming season would address Liz Lemon's sexual problems, explaining that \\"[we] finally get to the bottom of where [her] sextual dysfunction comes from.\\" In this episode, it is revealed that Liz's problem stems from an incident from her childhood involving a poster of singer Tom Jones. Actor Kelsey Grammer played himself in \\"Reaganing\\" in which he helps Jenna Maroney and Kenneth Parcell scam Carvel, an ice cream franchise. Following the broadcast, Carvel thanked the show for referencing them in the episode despite making them \\"the butt of the joke.\\" In addition, Carvel enjoyed the subplot scheme, noting it \\"was pretty funny stuff!\\" This was actor Seth Kirschner's third appearance as the character Shawn, a film and television director. In the episode, Shawn is the director of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America commercial and gets frustrated with Tracy Jordan when Tracy cannot remember his line during the shoot. Kirschner previously appeared in two season four episodes \\"Into the Crevasse\\" and \\"Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land\\". Jen Ponton, who plays a Carvel employee who gets fired, said that the cast and crew of 30 Rock were \\"wonderful to work with. Everyone was absolutely top-notch. The whole crew was very professional. They treated me very well\\". Ponton auditioned for her role in September and got the job within a few days. Cultural references Kenneth says that if Cookie Puss (pictured) were to learn of Jenna's plan to scheme Carvel the cake would \\"tear us apart with his fangs.\\" In the beginning of the episode, Jack tells Liz that he has entered \\"a magic zone of error-free living\\" which he calls \\"Reaganing\\"‚Äînamed after former United States President Ronald Reagan‚Äîand that the only people to accomplish this besides Reagan have been businessman Lee Iacocca, former General Electric Chairman and CEO Jack Welch, and former President of Iraq Saddam Hussein. Tracy tells Kenneth that he turned down the opportunity to host the MTV International Awards to film a commercial for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America instead. As a result of her participation in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Jenna is given a card from Carvel that entitles her to free ice cream cakes for life in which she and Kenneth decide to abuse the card which results in Jenna being banned from Carvel from life. This subplot was a reference to Dina Lohan, the mother of actress Lindsay Lohan, who abused her daughter's Carvel card and as a result she was banned from ever using the card. Liz says that after her mother found her under a Tom Jones poster with her underpants around her ankles her mother removed all her posters from her room which included Grizzly Adams, Larry Wilcox as his television character Officer Jon Baker from CHiPs, Harrison Ford as Han Solo from Star Wars, Philadelphia Phillies players Tug McGraw and Mike Schmidt, Kermit the Frog, and Gunther Gebel-Williams. After learning Jenna's scheme to con Carvel, Kenneth says that it is wrong and illegal, and says that if Cookie Puss knew about this \\"he'd tear us apart with his fangs.\\" This is a reference to Cookie Puss, an ice cream cake character created by Carvel in the 1970s. A television commentator opined that the Carvel storyline here referenced the 1973 caper film The Sting that starred Paul Newman and Robert Redford, as two professional grifters, who decide to con a mob boss, played by Robert Shaw. In addition, after ordering the cakes with mistakes on them at a Carvel location, Grammer touches his nose as a sign to Jenna and Kenneth, who are outside, that he has ordered them, a similar gesture that Newman did in the film. Reception According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Reaganing\\" was watched by 5.182 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 2.2 rating/7 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode constituted a 30 percent drop in viewership from the previous week's episode, \\"Live Show\\", which was watched by 6.701 million American viewers. Matt Hubbard received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for HitFix reported that despite \\"Reaganing\\" not being a perfect episode it was still \\"a very good one in what's so far ... been a very strong rebound season for 30 Rock.\\" Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote, \\"the episode was quick, sharp, and consistent\\". Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed Tracy's plot here, noting that his attempts to deliver a single line was highly entertaining. The Cornell Daily Suns Scott Eidler said that Jenna and Kenneth's subplot \\"wasn't laugh-out-loud funny\\", nonetheless \\"it was a nice realistic turn for characterization!\\" Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline deemed \\"Reaganing\\" an excellent episode from the series. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club was positive about Jenna and Kenneth's story, noting it went from amusing to hilarious. He was not \\"overly blown away\\" with Liz's plot, but said it redeemed itself at the end \\"by providing another nice moment of connection\\" between the Jack and Liz characters. Rabin gave \\"Reaganing\\" a B+ grade, praising the (non-existent) scene where Jack put pills into Tracy's jelly beans. Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News said that the best part of the episode was Jack McBrayer's Kenneth \\"actually [having] some funny lines for the first time .\\" The Fordham Rams Celeste Kmiotek said that the episode was \\"perhaps more awkward than normal ... but it was nonetheless hilarious, and was tempered by its ability to throw cultural references into everything until you almost forget what is actually being discussed.\\" Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett liked Kelsey Grammer's appearance, but mostly enjoyed the fact that 30 Rock devoted an episode to Tina Fey's character as \\"the sexual equivalent of a million Hindenburgs\\" and was pleased with the numerous Liz flashbacks from past episodes that were featured here. Not all reviews were positive. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad reported that this episode was an odd one produced by the show. \\"I don't know if it was the off- balance tone the episode had because two of the three plots took place outside, but it just wasn't as good as most episodes.\\" Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student called Jenna and Kenneth's plot a travesty, commenting that the two along with Grammer scamming Carvel was \\"diabolical, and definitely not funny enough to justify the horribleness\\". In regards to the episode, itself, Sanders wrote that it was \\"mostly awful\\".

He has been in several major soukous bands, including Bamboula de Papa Noel, Minzoto Sangela, Zaiko Langa Langa, Isifi Lokole, Yoka Lokole, Langa Langa Stars and Choc Stars, and founded his own band, Orchestre Anti-Choc, which is considered among the most influential of the genre.See Sinnock, Bozi Boziana Biography Bozi Boziana began his career in the afro-pop band Air Marine, but he reached success in 1974 when he joined Zaiko Langa Langa, one of the most influential Congolese bands ever. In Zaiko Boziana had the chance to play with soukous stars Papa Wemba and Evoloko Jocker. Less than one year later, Papa Wemba and Evoloko left Zaiko Langa Langa and Bozi Boziana followed them in a new band called Isifi Lokole. Internal disagreements then caused Papa Wemba, Boziana, Mavuela Somo and others to leave Isifi Lokole and found a new band that was called Yoka Lokole. This group was quite successful in 1976, but by the end of the year Papa Wemba left again to found Viva la Musica. Yoka Lokole lost popularity and Boziana left in 1977. For a few months Boziana was in a duo with Efonge Gina, another member of Zaiko Langa Langa, recording a few hits such as Selemani (credited to Boziana) and Libanko Ya Ngai (Gina). In June 1977, Gina left Zaiko Langa Langa for Tout-Grand Libanko and Boziana took his place in his former band. In 1981 producer Verckys Kiamuangana founded a soukous supergroup called Langa Langa Stars, with Evoloko Jocker, Dindo Yogo and others; Boziana was invited to join in and he did, leaving Zaiko Langa Langa for the secondo time. Langa Langa Stars lasted only a few years, and Boziana then moved to another major congolese band, Ben Nyamabo's Choc Stars, where he stayed until November 1985. With Choc Stars Boziana recorded some of his most famous songs ever, such as Sandu Kotti, Alena, Mbuta-Mutu, and Retrouvailles a Paris.See Sinnock, From Choc Stars to Big Stars With Choc Stars Boziana became a true celebrity, and so he founded his own band, called Orchestre Anti-Choc (or simply \\"Anti- Choc\\"). The name \\"Anti-Choc\\" was intended to emphasize the Boziana's heritage from Zaiko Langa Langa (as this band was also informally known as \\"Tout-Choc Anti-Choc Zaiko Langa Langa\\"). Boziana's Anti-Choc became one of the major soukous bands in Congo, and many talented musicians played in the band over time; examples are Fifi Mofude, Djo Nolo, Koffi Alibaba, Wally Ngonda, Rigo Star, Ngouma Lokito, Deesse Mukangi, Marthe Lamugenia, Ngimbi Yespe and Maoussi Solange. The first guitarist of the band was Matou Samuel, today a gospel singer; he was later replaced by Dodoly (previously in Lita Bembo's Orchestre Stukas), nicknamed \\"the sewing machine\\" because of the speed of his fingers moving on the guitar's fretboard. Dodoly's frenetic style became one of the trademarks of Anti-Choc, and was imitated by all the guitarists that replaced Dodoly in the following years. From the 1980s on Boziana has continued Anti-Choc as well as recorded some solo works and other collaborations. In 1998, his album Bana Saint-Gabriel (guesting other former Zaiko Langa Langa members, including Evoloko Jocker) has won the Kora All- African Award for the best album in Central Africa.

The beach is well known for surfing. The main wave at Nembrala has several sections, which can link up on bigger days. -The Point -Temples or Steeples. -Mountains -Lower Mountains/Beginners/Inner Tubes. *Type of wave: coral reef *Length: usually 200-300m, but can get over 500m on really big days. *Size: 2 to 15 feet+ (~4 to 30 feet+ faces). *Best tide: low. There is a very large tidal range of about 6m+. The wave breaks on all tides, but is generally better on lower tides. *Dangers: coral reef bottom, inexperienced surfers, hold-downs in big swells, and very remote location. Sunburn and long paddles. The wave is more than a kilometre offshore, which is a very long paddle at high tide without a boat. Sea urchins on the bottom. *Quality: it's not a true barreling, Indonesian-style wave, in comparison to other, more famous waves in Indonesia. Usually a long wall, but can barrel on rarer occasions, especially on lower tides. The wave tends to be bigger and better when the swell is more west, and suffers from lengthy flat spells. It can hold virtually any size swell, the main problem being the very strong winds in season, which make getting into bigger waves more difficult, (over 25 knots at times). The wave is unusual in that it often gets bigger further down the wave, due to focusing from refraction. There are numerous other waves in the area, of low to excellent quality, although access is sometimes only by boat, and some of these won't work at different times of the very large tidal range of more than 6m. These include Boa, Sucky Mamas, Dana, Do'a, the Bommie, and several other offshore island waves, as well as waves further around to the east of the island sometimes without a name, although these need very large swells.

The Azerbaijan Photographers Union was registered in the Ministry of Justice of the Azerbaijan Republic on the 20 November 1998 by certificate number 1073. At the beginning of 1990, with the collapse of the USSR, all working structures became worthless and it became apparent that there was need of an organization in which professional and amateur photographers ‚Äî all those who are devoted to photographic art ‚Äî would join together. At that time a serious, uniting moment in the organization's establishment became preparation and holding of the Photographers of Azerbaijan exhibition in Nantes, France in November 1995, where 105 works by 24 photographers were presented. After the exhibition in France, there were 3 years of debates, the charter's complying, overcoming obstacles, and the initiative group was formed to tackle this - registered the Union officially, although actually the Union already acted from 1994 on a voluntary basis, without legal status. The main purposes and tasks of the APU are promotion to the national development of photo art, popularization of its achievements in the country and abroad, preservation and creative use of photographic heritage. With the purpose of promotion and development of photo art the Union organizes exhibitions, competitions, festivals, master classes, conferences and symposiums with the participation of the Azerbaijani and foreign photographers, as well as promotes the amateur movement. 10 years passed from the APU's establishment. During this period the members of the creative union have organized and taken part in more than 100 exhibitions, including more than 30 in foreign countries (USA, UK, France, Turkey, Germany, Belgium, Ukraine, Greece, Russia, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia etc.).

He passed up substantial estates that subsequently became part of the fortune of the Walpole political family. Life He was son and heir of John Walpole of Houghton, Norfolk, by Catherine Calibut of Coxford in the same county, and was born on 28 January 1560. He matriculated as a fellow commoner at St Peter's College, Cambridge, in May 1576, the year after his cousin Henry Walpole had entered at the same college as a pensioner. He showed sympathy for Catholicism, and incurred the displeasure of his parents: in 1585 he was turned out of his home at Houghton, and adopted the name of Poor to indicate his want of means. Another cousin, William Walpole, offered him an asylum at North Tuddenham in Norfolk. He reconciled William to his wife, from whom he had been for estranged, and when in October 1587 William died, he left most of his large property to Edward, subject to the life interest of his widow. John Gerard was then active in Norfolk among the recusant gentry, and one of his first converts was Edward Walpole. At the same time Gerard induced him to sell the reversion of the manor of Tuddenham for a thousand marks. In April 1588 Walpole's father died, leaving as much as possible to his second son, Calibut, and not even naming his elder son Edward in his will. Five months later Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, died. The earl had a life interest in the estates of Amy Robsart, contiguous to those of the Walpoles, and these now descended to Edward Walpole as heir-at-law to Sir John Robsart, Amy's father. Edward Walpole, however, surrendered by deed all claim and title on the Robsart and the Houghton estates to his brother Calibut. He made his way to the continent, to become a Jesuit. He was in Flanders in 1590, and was admitted to the English College, Rome on 23 October 1590, where he remained two years studying theology. He was ordained priest on Ascension Day 1592, and shortly afterwards was admitted into the Society of Jesus. He was summoned to Tournai to go through his period of probation. The news of his receiving priest's orders at Rome reached England, and in 1597 he was outlawed ‚Äòfor a supposed treason done at Rome.‚Äô In 1598 Walpole returned to England, and began to exercise his functions as a Roman priest and Jesuit missioner, though hunted about from place to place. After his return to England he passed under the name of Rich as an alias. In 1605 he was granted a pardon, which would have put him in possession of the family estates on the death of his mother. She survived till 1612; but he renewed his deed of surrender to his brother, and the estates accordingly descended through him to Sir Robert Walpole and the Earls of Orford. He died in London on 3 November 1637, in his seventy-eighth year. Works He translated into English a work of the Christian humanist Louis Richeome as The Pilgrime of Loreto (1629).

Etymology  The protein ablomin is a component of the venom of the Japanese Mamushi snake, Gloydius blomhoffii. The term ‚Äòablomin‚Äô is an acronym derived from Agkistrodon blomhoffi, an old name for this snake.  Sources  The protein can be found in the venom of the Japanese Mamushi snake, a member of the Viperidae family.  Chemistry  Ablomin is part of the Cystein-Rich Secretory Protein (CRISP) family. CRISPs comprise a particular group of snake venom proteins distributed among the venom of several families of snakes, such as elapids, colubrids and vipers. The protein exists of 240 amino acids, coded by an mRNA of 1336 base pairs. Structurally, it is composed of three distinct regions: an N-terminal protein domain, a hinge region and a C-terminal cystein-rich domain. It has a molecular mass of 25 kDa. Ablomin shows great sequence homology with triflin (83.7%) and latisemin (61.5%), two other snake venom components of the CRISP family, which also target voltage-dependent calcium channels. In addition, it shows partial homology with helothermine (52.8%), a venom protein of the Mexican beaded lizard; this protein, however, targets other ion channels than ablomin.  Target  Ablomin reduces potassium-induced contraction of smooth muscles, suggesting that it blocks L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Moreover, ablomin may slightly inhibit rod-type cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGA1) channels.  Toxicity  Ablomin affects high potassium- induced contraction of arterial smooth muscle in rat-tails in a concentration- dependent matter. Reduction of arterial smooth muscle contraction in a rat- tail results in vasodilation of the rat-tails artery, which may lead to hypothermia. Blocking other L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels, for instance in the heart, may lead to arrhythmias and even cardiac arrest.

Biography He was born in Antwerp, but after the siege of Antwerp, his family moved to Delft in 1589, where he later joined the Guild of St. Luke there in 1613.Hans Jordaens I in the RKD According to Karel van Mander he had been a pupil of Martin Van Cleve who first became a member of the Antwerp guild in 1579. Hans Jordaens in Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck, 1604, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He was a good landscape and staffage painter currently (ca.1603-1604) living in Delft, who took as his wife, the second wife of Frans Pourbus the Elder after he died suddenly in 1580. His pupil was Anthonie Palamedes in Delft. The later art historian Arnold Houbraken, who mentioned his data was sketchy at best, confused this painter with his probable later descendants Hans III Jordaens (1590-1643) and the later Rome traveller Hans IV Jordaens (1616-1680). Hans Jordaans biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Houbraken mentions that he (Hans IV) was born in Delft, and travelled to Rome and received the nickname Pollepel (spoon) from the Bentvueghels, for his ability to spoon up figures on canvas. The widow of the lawyer Nicolaas Muys van Holy (1653/54-1717) owned a painting by him (Hans III) of the Pharaoh's army crossing the red sea and drowning with horses and wagons. Most such paintings are now attributed to Hans III Jordaens (d.1643), of Antwerp.Pharaoh's army perishes in the water (Red Sea) Painting attributed to Hans III Jordaens in the St. Jan Emanuel church (Zutphen) Son? Houbraken also mentioned that Luca Giordano was possibly his son from the period that he lived in Naples (his tone shows he felt this unlikely), whose works hung (ca. 1712-1718) in the gallery of Jan van Beuningen in Amsterdam. Though this has been dismissed by later historians, there is evidence of an engraver L. Jordaens who was active around 1660 and who could have been the son of Hans IV. He worked with the mapmaker Zacharias Roman on landscapes of Zeeland.L. Jordaens in the RKD He died in Delft, or Voorburg.

He was born in the Netherlands and became a British citizen. She, with her husband, ran galleries in London, Brighton and Derbyshire and was known for encouraging many young artists and sculptors. In the 1920s she bought many works by Henry Moore and encouraged Cedric Morris. In 1930 she opened her first gallery at 3-5 Burlington Gardens, Mayfair, London. It has been suggested that it was the artist Frances Hodgkins who finally persuaded or perhaps goaded Mrs Wertheim to move from enthusiastic supporter of 'modern art' to a fully fledged gallery owner. Wertheim recalls the incident in her 1947 book 'Adventure in Art' - \\"Frances exclaimed to my husband, 'Your wife should open a gallery for us poor artists: her enthusiasm would make it a success!'...Those words however spoken more than half in jest, sowed a seed in my mind that was to bear fruit later.\\"Wertheim, Lucy [1947].

The site was purchased from the Georgian Orthodox Church in 1560 with permission by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire, and the monastery was constructed in stages. The church building was erected in 1885, with renovation in 1985. The site includes a printing press, an organ workshop, a library and a Catholic school. History The monastery was built in several stages on a site transferred to the Franciscan Order from the Georgian Orthodox Church in 1558‚Äì59 by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Because the old church building was no longer considered sufficient for the needs of the parish, in 1850 Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I granted the order permission to demolish the old church and build a new one in its place, under the condition that the new church be no larger than the old one. Official support for the construction of the church was provided by Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph I during his visit to Jerusalem in 1869. Originally, Franz Joseph I made his contribution on the condition that the church would be built according to the plans of his own architect. Although the leaders of the Franciscan order rejected this condition, he agreed to contribute about 60,000 francs for the project. The construction took three years and was completed 29 November 1885. The church's architect, Father Raffaelle Cingolani from Montecassiano, was inspired by the work of Italian architect Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola. The church was built in the typical style of a basilica. Unlike most church buildings built on an east‚Äìwest axis with the apse and the altar in the east, Saint Saviour is built along a north‚Äìsouth axis. A clock tower is located on the side of the church. In 1932, two stories were added to the clock tower in honour of the 700th anniversary of the death of Saint Anthony of Padua. In 1985, the church and monastery were renovated in honour of the 100th anniversary of its construction. Over the years, a Catholic school for boys and girls, a printing press and an organ workshop were built on the monastery compound, and are still in operation today.

Collecting signatures online, and in public, ecumenical gatherings, over 160 Arizona clergy signed on in solidarity.

Unlike other Phyllonorycter species that feed on Alnus, the larvae are grey (instead of white). The pupa is made in a light brown cocoon that is fastened to the roof of the mine.

It was self-produced by Tyler, the Creator, and was first self-released on December 25, 2009. Due to its free online release and lack of retail availability, Bastard is commonly considered a mixtape, although Tyler himself refers to the project as his debut album.  Concept and content  The songs were written and recorded by Tyler from 2007 through 2009, and released on December 25th 2009. Tyler produced most of the mixtape using FL Studio.https://hypebeast.com/2011/7/respect-interview-with-tyler-the-creator Bastard features Tyler speaking to a character named Dr. TC, who acts as Tyler's therapist and guidance counselor. The title track contains Dr. TC hinting that Tyler's then-upcoming debut album, called Goblin (2011), will be an additional session with him, stating that there would be three sessions. Both songs \\"Odd Toddlers\\" and \\"Slow It Down\\" were previously released on The Odd Future Tape (2008). The chopped and screwed version (which was hosted by fellow rapper and label-mate Mike G) was released for free online. On December 25, 2010, one year after the album's initial release, Bastard was re-released with Brandun DeShay's verse on \\"Session\\" being replaced with a verse from Mike G, due to a dissension between Tyler and DeShay. The project is now made available on Odd Future's online music store, with DeShay's vocals returning to that same track. Tyler later announced intended plans on re-releasing Bastard in a remastered physical form through Odd Future Records. However, since this announcement, nothing has materialized.  Reception and controversy  Bastard received critical acclaim, and was ranked at number 32 on Pitchfork's list of the Top 50 Albums of 2010, while the single \\"French!\\" was ranked at number 61 on Pitchfork Media's list of the Top 100 Tracks of 2010. The mixtape, alongside Tyler's debut album Goblin, caused controversy among members of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, which led to Theresa May, who was Home Secretary at the time, imposing a ban on Tyler from entering the country for three to five years. The ban was met with uproar, which was revisited when May was elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Tyler and many of his fans believe the ban was racially motivated, with Tyler stating he felt he was being treated \\"like a terrorist\\", and that they did not like the fact that their children were idolizing a black man.

Biography  Lavery was born in Scotland and brought up in Dumbarton.Maritime Media Awards 2007 Upon graduating, Lavery worked first as a teacher, then in the printing industry, before gradually fulfilling his interest in maritime heritage as an author, consultant, and curator, building a solid reputation as a highly respected authority in the field. He worked at Chatham Historic Dockyard on the Wooden Walls exhibition. During 14 years in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich he developed the modern collecting policy and worked on numerous exhibitions such as Seapower, All Hands, and several of the galleries in the Neptune Court development. He has lectured regularly on cruise ships, including many trips on the square rigger Sea Cloud, and he undertakes maritime tours in the United Kingdom and Europe. Traditional Boats & Tall Ships refers to him as \\"one of the world's leading naval historians.\\"\\"Book Review: The Frigate Surprise\\", Traditional Boats & Tall Ships, p. 12 He has since published over 30 books, covering marine architecture, ship construction (including several in Conway's Anatomy of the Ship series), and naval warfare from its infancy to present day.

Together with those of Andreas Hallander, his classically styled buildings form part of the legacy of 19th-century Danish Golden Age architects who reconstructed areas of the old town which had been destroyed by fire.Sys Hartmann, \\"Johan Martin Quist\\", Kunstindeks Danmark Retrieved 15 October 2010. His most important work is Gustmeyer House (Gustmeyers Gaard), located opposite Christiansborg Palace on Ved Stranden. Completed in 1797 for the well-to-do merchant, Frederik Ludolf Gustmeyer (1752‚Äì1804), it is one of Copenhagen's first bourgeois residences with free- standing columns. All Quist's surviving works are now listed buildings. Early life and education Johan Martin Quist was born in Copenhagen, the son of Nicolaj Mathiessen Quist, a shoemaker, and Anna Marie Elisabeth Engelbrecht. After being trained as a mason, he studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under the influential Caspar Frederik Harsdorff, winning the large silver medal in 1775 and the small gold medal in 1781. Career Quist was one of the Copenhagen builders who so quickly and effectively helped to reconstruct the areas of the old town which had been destroyed by the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. His imposing apartment buildings are inspired by Harsdorff's neoclassical style. He and his fellow builders formed a close-knit group, reinforced by their membership of the civil guard and fire corps. They married each other's daughters and widows and acted as godfathers at christenings. Huge fortunes were made as they bought plots of land, built them up and sold them again. Quist's earliest recognised building is Lykkens Pr√∏ve in Vesterbro built 1790. The building later housed the Christiani Institut, a boys school operated by educator and priest Christoph Johann Rudolph Christiani (1761‚Äì1841). In line with Hardorff's own model on Kongens Nytorv, it was decorated with four fluted pilasters in the inset central section while the lateral sections were accentuated with sandstone balconies on the first floor. After the great fire, building regulations called for buildings on street corners to be set back to provide more room for fire engines. Quist took advantage of the new rules by designing bow-shaped corners, for example in the building on the corner of Knabrost√¶de and Kompagnistr√¶de in 1797. Two years later he built an even more effective corner house at 47 Vimmelskaftet where both facades boasted pilasters on three floors. Perspnal life Quist married Cathrine Margrethe Otte(n) on 18 January 1785 in Copenhagen. The marriage was later dissolved. Quist died in Copenhagen on 25 April 1818 and was buried in Assistens Cemetery.

It was designed by William Munro and possibly Hilly (attributed) and built from 1862 to 1864. It is also known as Glenyarrah; Seaford House. The property is owned by Strata Plan No. 58597 (Private). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The house was built between 1862 and 1864. The architect's identity is uncertain, but it was most likely either William Munro or Hilly. It was definitely Munro who built the gate pillars as there was an advertisement placed by Munro for stonemasons to build these at this house in 1864. Ownership and occupation, 1826 - 1862 The site of the building originally formed part of the \\"Point Piper Estate\\" being a portion of the granted to Captain John Piper by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1820. Following Piper's financial difficulties, the holding was purchased in 1826 by the merchant Daniel Cooper of Cooper & Levy. Cooper returned to England in 1831 and on his death the major part of his estate was left to his nephew also a Daniel Cooper of the successful mercantile house of D. Cooper & co. Although advertising for leasing of subdivision allotments of the \\"Point Piper Estate\\" can be found from May 1853, the property probably formed part of the group that was offered in The Sydney Morning Herald on 5 November 1856: By 20 May 1857 the property having a land holding of had been leased by Cooper to the merchant Edwin Thomas Beilby for a term of 99 years at A¬£65 per year. The lease commenced from 1 October 1856 with payment of this agreement was a building covenant that stipulated that the lessee would: \\"within eight years from the lease lay out and expand exclusive of internal paintings and decoration the sum of A¬£2,000 in erecting substantial stone or brick buildings\\" and that within six months on completion of works, verification would be provided to the lessor that such amounts had been expended. This would therefore suggest that as of May 1857 construction of dwellings on the property had not commenced. Although the Sands Directories records Beilby residing at New South Head Road up to 1861 it is unlikely that this refers to the \\"Gladswood\\" property; as on 8 January 1858 Beilby sold the leasehold to the prominent merchant, pastoralist and politician Samuel Deane Gordon MLC for A¬£800. The first suggestion of building works may be recorded by an invitation to tender in the Sydney Morning Herald \\"for building a house at Double Bay\\" dated 7/4/1860, with documents available at Gordon's Bridge Street office. Progress of construction may also be followed by tender notices in The Sydney Morning Herald. On 14 November 1860 tenders were called \\"for the joiners' work\\". Plans and specifications were available on site with further information from a Mr Munro, Glebe Road or at his Sydney office. By 25 April 1861 tenders were called for painting the \\"house in the course of erection at Double Bay\\", tenders referred again to Gordon's Bridge Street office with further information available from Mr Munro, Glebe Street. Carpenters and masons were required again by the 24/4/1862, now recorded for \\"Mr Gordon's residence, Double Bay\\". Plans available from Mr Munro, architect, Pitt St, North. By 8 August 1864 it would appear general construction of the residence and perhaps outbuildings were completed for tenders were called for \\"gate pillars at Glenyarrah, Double Bay\\", applications to Mr Munro 64 Pitt Street. It would appear, therefore, that the residence was constructed sometime between November 1860 and substantially completed by April 1862. The residential form of the property was more than likely completed in the final months of 1864, with the dwelling being identified now by name and having its entry identified by \\"gate pillars\\". There is also a suggestion in the tender notices that the building included the involvement of an architect by the name of Munro. We may suggest therefore that Gordon was primarily the driving force in commissioning a purpose designed and built dwelling for himself; financed in large part by the lessor, Sir Daniel Cooper. The architect referred to in the tender notices was in all probability the little known builder/architect William Munro (1812-1881). Munro is credited with three buildings listed on the Register of the National Estate. Although without formal architectural training it appears his competence was such that he was responsible for a considerable body of ecclesiastical architecture primarily for the Roman Catholic Church. Munro's speciality was the \\"Gothic style\\" and all three registered buildings are variations on the Gothic idiom. \\"Gladswood House\\" is representative being an interpretation of the \\"perpendicular or pointed Gothic\\" applied to a domestic situation. Munro may have sought his design inspiration from pattern books of the day for a close model for \\"Gladswood\\" may be found in JC Loudon's An Encyclopaedia of Cottage, Farm and Villa Architecture and Furniture, both in the 1833 and 1850 editions. Design XX and Design XXI of the 1833 edition are variations of Gothic villa architecture and features in both may be found simplified or interpreted in Munro's design. The plan of the \\"castellated style\\" Design XX appears to have been manipulated to suit its Sydney harbour side location. The central axial entry has been relocated to the side and the servant wing detached as in the following Design XXI, however, the plan arrangement of the rooms is a feature found at \\"Gladswood\\". Similarly a close comparison may be made with the Gothic verandah treatment located on the side. Design XXI \\"a villa in the style of pointed architecture\\" shares the asymmetrical facade treatment, the central emphasis of the entry, the side ornamental screen fence wall and the detached service wing. The picturesque roofscape of finials, turrets, attached Tudor chimneys and steep roof are also common features that continue in the window mouldings and castellated projecting bay windows. It is not inconceivable that \\"Gladswood\\" may have presented a similar simplified garden front with screen wall and attached service building as that indicated in this design. Although Munro designed prestige villas for some of the prominent citizens of the day it is not known what form or appearance these took. However, that Munro was consistent in his \\"Gothic\\" detailing is evidenced in his later design for St. Andrews College at Sydney University where similar elements found at \\"Gladswood\\" re-occur. Samuel Deane Gordon Samuel Deane Gordon Samuel Deane Gordon (1811-1882) built Gladswood House, then called Glenyarrah in about 1863. Samuel Deane Gordon was born in 1811 at Ballynahinch, County Down, Ireland. His father David Gordon was a farmer. His mother's name was Mary Deane.Australian Dictionary of Biography, ‚ÄúSamuel Deane Gordon‚Äù. Online reference He came to Sydney in 1830 at the age of 19 and worked in several mercantile houses before becoming a successful merchant. He then turned to pastoral pursuits and leased Banandra run of over 50,000 acres on the Murrumbidgee River. He moved to Sydney and established a wine and spirit business and became the Director of several important companies. Gladswood House, . In 1839 he married Eliza Dickson in East Maitland and the couple had several children. Unfortunately she died in 1856. He remarried in 1863 in Ireland. His new bride was Emily Fielding, daughter of Joshua Fielding esq. of Belfast. During the 1860s he acquired more pastoral properties and became very wealthy. He was a prominent Presbyterian became a founder of St Andrew's College, Sydney, and member of its council. He was also a vice-president of the Highland Society and a member of the Victoria Club and the Linnean Society of New South Wales. He joined the committee of the Chamber of Commerce in 1867 and in the 1870s served on the committees of the Benevolent Asylum, the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary and the Hospital for Sick Children, and was a vice- president of the Young Men's Christian Association and the Horticultural Society of New South Wales. It is to Gordon's occupation that the first naming of the building Glenyarrah may be attributed. The earliest identification by name being the tender notices of 18 August 1864. G. Nesta Griffiths in her book \\"Point Piper Past and Present\\" suggests the name may be a compilation of the Scottish \\"glen\\" for valley and the anglicised aboriginal word \\"yarrah\\" for bum tree, being \\"Valley of the Gums\\". The Woollahra History & Heritage Society date the house to 1856, noting that the design may possibly be attributed to architect J. F. Hilly and note that under Gordon's occupation it was called \\"Seaford House\\" and this was changed to \\"Glenyarrah\\" during the stay (1883-1913) of Mr T. H. Kelly Snr. and family and later under Mr Spencer Brunton to Gladswood. Gordon may not have been Gladswood's first resident, for an undated Council Rate Assessment entry, possibly no later than 1863, records Gordon as owner with a J. H. Atkinson as \\"person rated\\". The rate records of 1863-64 also show both S. D. Gordon and the merchant and member of parliament William Walker as being \\"rated persons\\" for Gladswood, with Walker also entered for the adjacent property. G. Nesta Griffiths suggests that Walker took occupation of Gladswood whilst his own house Redleaf\\" was being constructed on the neighbouring property. The earliest verifiable illustration of \\"Gladswood\\" forms part of the background to a general view of Double Bay in The Illustrated Sydney News of 23 December 1871. A glimpse of the property within its context of Double Bay may be obtained from some general views of the period. An early photograph thought to date from around the 1870s shows the building in what must have been its early appearance at the time of Gordon's occupation. This clearly shows that the present southern wing is a later extension, it also shows the crenulated service wing compound wall with verandah and servant block in the background. An Eric Bayliss photograph of indicates the building's former commanding position on the point between the two bays. Gordon's occupation continued until his death in 1882 and is recorded in his monogram incorporated in the strained glass window on either side of the entry vestibule and panels that light the main stair. On his death Gordon left Glenyarrah to his daughter Jessie Maria Gordon who in turn sub-let the property to a F. B. Lark from 1883-1885. Both Munro and Gordon were associated with the setting up of St. Andrew's College at the University of Sydney, while the latter is commemorated with a fine stained-glass window in St. Andrew's Scots Church in Rose Bay. He died in 1882 and having been predeceased by his second wife he left his fortune to his surviving three daughters. Jessie Maria Gordon inherited Gladswood House but as she had married and lived in England she leased the house to Francis Bothamley Lark for two years and then to Thomas Hussey Kelly who subsequently bought the house. The Kelly family Thomas Hussey Kelly In 1885 the property was sub-let to Thomas Hussey Kelly (1830-1901) a wool-broker and businessman. Kelly bought the leasehold of Gladswood House in 1887 for A¬£12,000 and went on to buy the freehold in May 1901, three months before he died. The extent and form of the property at the time of Kelly's occupation may be obtained from a Water Board Plan of 1895. Kelly was born in 1830 in Ireland. He came to Australia at the age of 30 and found employment as a clerk and later as a wool broker for Gilchrist, Watt & Co. He established his own wool broking firm in 1874 and became very wealthy. He was the Director of numerous companies and by 1901 he was a shareholder in no fewer than twenty gold and copper mining companies. For many years he was managing director of the Sydney Smelting Co. In 1864 he married Mary Ann Dick and the couple had four sons and two daughters. One of his sons was Frederick Septimus Kelly (1881-1916) who was a gifted musician and whose diary has recently been published. He lived mostly in England and in the diary he refers to his return visit to Gladswood House in 1911 to see his family. He describes his walking the beaches, body surfing at Bondi Beach, visiting on foot and by boat the haunts of his childhood, practicing the piano, playing for guests and making contact with Sydney society as he prepared for his musical debut. Several years later he joined the Royal Naval Division to fight in the War and became a personal friend of Rupert Brooke, the famous English poet. When Rupert died in 1915 he carried his coffin for burial on the Island of Skyros and later composed a musical elegy in Brook's honour. Frederick also was killed in the War a year later and was buried on the Somme. Ethel Knight Mollison, wife of Thomas Herbert Kelly (called Bertie) Thomas Hussey Kelly died in 1901 and his son Thomas Herbert Kelly (1875-1948) inherited Gladswood House. A view of the property taken around 1900 shows the boat house and pier with the grounds and house in the background. This section of the property was formally incorporated into the title holdings in 1909. Previously it had formed \\"part of the bed or shores of 'The Port\\" and was purchased by Kelly from the Government for the sum of A¬£33 15s. Auction notices by the agents Raine and Horne, dating 1904 and 1905, for the subdivision of an adjacent property shows \\"Glenyarrah\\" and is indicative of the property's identification as a local landmark. That this was clearly the case from the bay is shown in a photograph dating from the final years of Kelly's occupation. House Party at Gladswood House in 1911. Ethel is seated in the centre and Bertie is third from the left. Thomas (called Bertie) was born in 1875 in Sydney. He was educated at Eton in England and returned to Australia in 1898. When his father died he became director of the family firm the Sydney Smelting Company. In 1903 he married Ethel Knight Mollison (1875-1949). Ethel was a Canadian born actress who had been invited by the theatre company J. C. Williamson to perform on the stage. She met Bertie while she was here and married him in Melbourne. The couple lived at Gladswood House from 1903 until 1913 and during that time they had many house parties. A newspaper of 1908 carried the following description of their social activities. ‚ÄúAt her charming house at Double Bay, Mrs. Kelly's artistic taste is displayed in the arrangement of her home, and beautiful things abound everywhere. Both she and her husband are art lovers, being devoted to music and painting, Mr. Kelly being one of our best amateur violinists.‚Äù Being lovers of music they frequently invited opera singers to their home. In 1911 this house party was photographed by Arthur Wigram Allen, a notable amateur Sydney photographer and is shown on the left. The opera stars are Maria Ranzenberg (far left), Signor Zeni (fourth from right) Madame Wayda (third from right) and the most famous star Eleonora de Cisneros (far right). Ethel is seated in the centre and Bertie is third from the left. In 1913 the Kellys sold Gladswood House to John Spencer Brunton. John Spencer Brunton John Spencer Brunton Kelly sold the property in 1913 to John Spencer Brunton (1861-1937). Brunton (1861-1937) was born in 1861 in Melbourne. His father was Thomas Brunton who had foundered the prominent firm Australian Flour Mills. John was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne and then entered his father's business. In 1887 his father opened a branch of his company at Granville near Sydney and John eventually became a senior partner. He was a member of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce and in 1900 became the President. He was a racehorse owner, yachtsman and golfer. In 1886, he built Brunyarra at Strathfield which still exists today. John Brunton's first wife died in 1890 and he remarried in 1898 to Eleanor Thorne. She was known for her charitable works and was the first honorary treasurer of the New South Wales division of the Red Cross Society and a life-governor of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Camperdown. The transfer of ownership to Brunton is recorded on 29 December 1913 and it would appear that he lost no time altering the building to suit his needs. An article on the house on completion of renovations suggests that the dwelling was in some state of disrepair, and may have been the stimulus for Brunton's sweeping alterations. When Brunton bought Gladswood House in 1913 he commissioned the prominent architect Howard Joseland to make additions to the house. Joseland's commission dates from the time he was in partnership with Hugh Vernon in the practice of Joseland and Vernon. However, it appears the work was principally carried out by Joseland alone continuing into his period as a sole practitioner between 1914-1919. Joseland's daughter later married one of Brunton's sons and the reception was held at Gladswood House. This was widely reported in the newspapers of the time. Brunton died in 1937 and the property was sold to Rose Bay builder Frederick Louis Perini who modified the building to become a guest house. In the 1990s it was converted to luxury apartments. The extension and extensive refurbishment does not have much in common with Joseland's general design work, which favoured the \\"Queen Anne Style\\". He was an advocate for the development of an \\"Australian Style\\" and was critical of over ornamentation, his own house being testament to his pursuit of such interests. Typical of his work are such building as Sargood Hall in Ivanhoe, originally buildings for the Burnside Presbyterian Homes for Children at North Parramatta, or the Nicholson residence at Wahroonga of 1900. Joseland was not unfamiliar, however, with a brief that required the incorporation of design elements taken from an existing building into new works as is evidence in his extension for the retailer F Lassetter & Co. in 1899. Here an existing facade was extended and internal design elements from the original building repeated in new works. The atypical nature of the Gladswood refurbishment in Joseland oeuvre is perhaps a response to his client, Brunton's requirement for a building consistent with pretensions to the landed gentry of Brunton's ancestral Scotland. This, coupled with a personal interest in his client through his daughter's later marriage to Brunton's son, may have made him more amicable to compromising his own strongly held beliefs for architecture. Elements of Joseland's preference for simple and unadorned line may be found in the less public spaces where one finds the simpler fire surrounds in white painted timber a favoured motif as that found in Joseland's designs for the furniture manufacturer Norton and Reed. Similar consistent detailing to Joseland's general work is witnessed in the external treatment of the southern wing and extension of the stairwell which are clad in timber shingle. Such external treatment is consistent with his preference for Queen Anne and may be found in his work on the Berry Estate or the Neutral Bay Land Company estate. Council records indicate that a permit for the Gladswood building alterations were approved on 24 November 1913 being for works valuing A¬£3,800. The extension on the south of the front facade dates from this period and much of the internal refurbishment and joinery fittings within the original fabric may be attributed to Joseland. It is to Brunton that the change of the name of the property took place from Glenyarrah to Gladswood. The name refers to \\"Gladswood House\\", a small \\"seat\\" in Gladswood, Berwickshire County, Scotland; the area to which the Brunton family took their origins. The name Gladswood may still be seen below that of its former owner carved into the stone flaggings under the door mat of the front entry. The extent of Brunton's changes to the building were considerable these included the construction of a southern wing providing a formal dining room and ballroom as well as refurbishment of most of the ground and first floor areas. The works may also have included the construction of a garage but available information cannot establish its location. The building as it now stands is in effect a legacy of these alteration works undertaken by Brunton and architect Howard Joseland. The Woollahra History & Heritage Society attribute the extensions to architect G. Flen Gilling, noting they included a fireplace and oak panelling from 14th century England. Brunton continued to own the property until 1927 at which time he sold the entire holding to the estate agents, Edward Harold Maas and Henry Rickards Maas for the sum of A¬£45,000. It appears that Maas had some difficulty getting subdivision plans approved by Council, numerous disputes arising, primarily with regard to the extent and costs of road works. Brunton continued to occupy Gladswood whilst the property was subdivided into fourteen allotments with Gladswood being Lot 6. The subdivision auction notice of 24 September 1927 indicates that the land holding for Gladswood was limited more or less to its building line whilst retaining a portion of land that formed its northern aspect over Double Bay. At the end of the \\"hook like\\" street of Gladswood Gardens and at the rear of no. 21 can be seen, behind the multi-car garage, the stable and coach house for the original Seaford House (/Glenyarrah/Gladswood). Brunton purchased the dwelling back from Maas in 1928 and the rate records of this year indicate for the first time Gladswood Gardens as a locality with \\"Gladswood House\\" as being No. 11-13 Gladswood Gardens. In 1935 he also purchased back Lot 5 which has access to the pier. Brunton continued to occupy the house until his death in 1937. 1937 - 1988 Following Brunton's death the property was transferred to his sons John Moffitt Brunton and Thomas Gladswood Brunton who in turn sold it to the Rose Bay builder Frederick Louis Perini, the transfer recorded in February 1939. Photographs dating c.1939 indicate that the dwelling still retained its northerly aspect over the bay. Perini commissioned the architect JA Dobson to convert the residence and provide a substantial western addition for \\"multiple occupancy\\" use; Council approved plans for these works date from February 1938. The limited material available suggests that this may have been a major and sizeable contract for Dobson whose background was principally involved in civil engineering works. Following his commencement in practice in Australia in 1921, he appears to have been involved in domestic work of a modest nature. In 1939 Perini leased the building for a period of twelve years to Gwendoline Jean Von Tidermann, who operated the building as a \\"Guest House'. In 1951 the property was sold to a company trading as \\"Gladswood Freehold\\" who leased the building for a \\"Guest House\\" to Ray William Stafford and Hannah Maria Stafford. The building changed ownership a number of times but largely remained as a \\"Guest House/Private Hotel\\" until 1988. , Ian Joye's Coronet Investments develop a \\"European-inspired\\" block of three three bedroom, two-level apartments behind (west of) Gladswood House.The Sydney Morning Herald, Domain 11‚Äì12 December 2010. The building has been recently been tastefully restored.  Description  Constructed of sandstone, it features two wings, a verandah with three bays, a slate roof, Tudor chimneys and a fireplace that is thought to go back to 14th century England. Further extensions and alterations were carried out after 1901.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company (1981), p.2/133 \\"Gladswood House\\" represents one of the examples of picturesque Gothic that was a favoured style of \\"romantic embellishment\\" to the Sydney foreshore dating back to the earliest colonial period. Immediate examples within the area include Lindesay and Carthona at Darling Point. Both dwellings represent the colonial approach of simplified \\"Regency\\" and \\"Tudor\\" Gothic and are at variance with Gladswood with its more picturesque \\"perpendicular\\" effects. The simplified nature of the earlier Lindesay and Carthona are perhaps reflections on the economic situation of the earlier period that may have prevented the extent of detailing found in \\"Gladswood\\" or the later still \\"castellated Gothic\\" of Swifts also at Darling Point. Interestingly, both Lindesay and Carthona are cited as being derived from Loudon's pattern book. Where the reference to Loudon's model at Lindesay is somewhat less obvious, Carthona and Gladswood House are closer to the designs in the pattern book. Unlike Lindesay and Carthona, Gladswood has lost its close relationship of the original building to a harbour view, a fundamental feature in the prescriptive siting of Loudon. Grounds The original land holding was little over subdivided in 1927 into fourteen blocks and establishing its existing holding in 1938. The original entrance to the property was from New South Head Road through stone gate pillars possibly constructed late 1864. On entry to the property immediately to the north was stone Lodge with attached verandah, the date of its demolition is now known. The entrance to the grounds was directed on the west by a stone retaining wall, the drive followed the eastern boundary before being redirected by another wall to the house proper. Steps near the north-eastern boundary before being redirected by another wall to the house proper. Steps near the north- eastern corner of the building carried one down to the \\"Fernery\\" as well as the stone pier and timber boat house. These as well as the stone walls that fronted the bay may be seen in the Eric Bayliss photograph taken around 1875 (frontpiece) . Sections of the retaining walls and stone pier are still extant, primarily on the neighbouring northern property. It is believed that by the time of Brunton's occupation the Fernery was demolished and may have been replaced by a swimming pool and tennis court. The drive on reaching the house arced back as a return as well as continuing past the house that led to the stables and servant wing. The stables were located at the south-western corner of the site and consisted of a single storey stone building running east-west along the southern boundary. Immediately adjacent orientated north- south was a wooden structure possible the stables proper, this was framed by a retaining wall. The stone building still stands and serves as the residence for 21 Gladswood Gardens. Nothing remains of the original landscaped grounds of Gladswood. Servant and service wing To the south of the house was a collection of structures that probably formed the original servant and service quarters. Grouped around a well and enclosed within a compound by a crenellated stone wall, its entrance was from the south. The main building of this complex was a single storey stone structure. This probably conformed to the usual arrangement of Kitchen, Laundry and Pantry below with bedroom accommodation over. This building was connected to the residence by a covered verandah. Following the renovations of 1913 it is possible that the well may have been filled or covered as the construction of the Dining/Ballroom would have been in close proximity to its perimeter. These works would also have necessitated the demolition of part of the enclosing wall and an attached timber structure that may have housed the pantries of the main house and have been the point of entry to the basement. The connecting Verandah may have been demolished and replaced by a covered Courtyard which would have connected the servant wing to the main residence. Main residence The main building originally was a two-storey stone structure of two wings framing a three bayed verandah. Its original external appearance remains largely intact. The southern perimeter of the main building originally stopped along the line of the wall immediately adjacent to the southern window of the entrance hall. The toothing of the stonework for the dining Room/Ballroom extension is clearly visible on the front facade. Entry vestibule Within the entry vestibule under the door mat may be found evidence of J. S. Brunton's occupation; for the name Brunton with Gladswood under are carved into the sandstone flaggings of the floor. The entry vestibule also contains two stained glass windows the two top lights of which contain depictions of Flora and Pamona; the Roman gods of flowering or blossoming plants. These probably date from around 1875 and were made by the firm of Lyon, Cottier & Co of Sydney, the leading exponents of stained glass in Australia of their time. Lyon & Cottier commenced trading in 1873, hence the stained glass works are a later addition to the house possibly dating from the time of Gordon's involvement in construction of St. Andrew's College which contains much of their work. The panels show the influences of Pre-Raphaelitism and the design was also used in the depiction of the seasons, but here used in the common motif of wealth and abundance. Although appropriate symbols of the day for an entrance, they may also have had additional significance for Gordon in his involvement with the Horticultural and Agricultural Societies of NSW. The bottom sash of these windows also contain Gordon's monogram and motto \\"in deo fiducia est mia\\", (In God is my trust) surrounded my motifs depicting Australian flora and fauna. The panels are fine examples of Lyon & Cottier's works and should be preserved. The suspended lantern light fitting dates from the 1913 renovation works. Above the main entry door the stone lintel carries a date in Roman numerals of 1857. This has often been assumed to indicate the date of construction of the building, although this cannot be ruled out entirely it more likely refers back to the date of the original lease when terms for the construction of the dwelling were agreed. The front door although conforming in outline to the original is of recent construction. The original door appears to have been panelled. The area in front of the building was originally paved in a hexagonal paving block, with planter beds in front of the walls. The existing entrance hall has been extended in width as part of the renovations undertaken by Brunton. Formerly a passage with an adjoining room that may have served as pantry/storage space it also had access to the servant/service wing complex. It contains some of the principal features of the house, its plastered relief ceilings, oak dado wall panelling and large ornate carved timber fireplace, all date from the 1913 renovations. The plaster ornamental panels framed between solid timber beams are of excellent quality and are in good condition. The existing solid timber doors with their deeply moulded architraves also date from the Brunton renovations and are in contrast to the more simple Victorian trims on the First Floor some of which may be original. The fireplace has previously been believed to have been imported from England and amongst its ornamentation may be found a 1399 carved its apex has also been an item of speculative interest. The date of 1399 is believed to refer to the date to which the Brunton family traced their origins; (refer notes on Study) the armorial shield below is the heraldic device of the Scottish line of the Brunton family. The timber fire surround was designed by the architect Howard Joseland who was well known for his timber joinery detailing. The house is also reported to contain oak panelling from 14th century England. Although these features do not form part of the original 19th century fabric the quality of the joinery, timber and plaster work are excellent. The existing suspended lantern light fitting was also designed by Joseland and should if possible be incorporated or adapted into any proposed works. Joseland was also responsible for the design of most of the furniture that once decorated the principal rooms of the Ground Floor. Cellar The southern extension of the Entry Hall is evidenced in the cellar space below the entrance hall area. Its dimensions conform to the line of the original 19th century wall configuration and the base structure of the western return wall is still to be seen. The position of an access point to the cellar space immediately adjacent to the entrance door is unusual and may have been that this area was formerly a service room or pantry space. With the construction of the Dining/Ballroom the cellar was now deprived of its former external access and the retention of this opening may have proved convenient in providing a wood store for the hall fireplace. The position of the door and service opening which provided access from the servant/service wing may still be found within the southern wall of the cellar. The contention that the ornate fireplace found in the ground floor entrance hall was not part of the original fabric is verified by the reinforced concrete support base for the hearth. Dining room/ballroom The dining room/ballroom forms the Ground Floor area of a wing that was added at the time of Brunton's renovation and all the finishes including the fireplace were designed by Howard Joseland. The entire room is largely in its original state apart from the intrusion of a bathroom in the south-west corner, this dates from a later time than the 1938 conversion of the building into a Guest House and may have been during the upgrading of facilities for its use as a private hotel with self-contained facilities. Formerly this corner contained an access door in the southern wall which led to the service wing, perhaps following the demolition of the service complex this external door was relocated to the western wall which led out to a covered verandah area. The ornamental panel ceiling and timber beams are substantially in good condition apart from some damage particularly along the southern wall and water penetration damage near the eastern by window. The carved timber bosses formerly held frosted bulbs that provided the main lighting for the room. These fittings have been removed and fluorescent fittings fitted to the ceiling beams. The room contains a large ornamental carved timber fireplace of high craftsmanship. On the eastern wall a recess houses an oak sideboard with lead light windows over. Within the four window panels are stained glass emblems, two of which contain the arms of Victoria and NSW, no doubt indicative of the Brunton family business associations. The impact of these windows has been diminished by the addition of a geometric pattern in leadlight found in the eastern glazing as well as the bay window of the first floor room above. The timber floor is mitred at the corners indicating the rooms alternate use as a Ballroom space. As the room is substantially intact, the detailing should be retained. This may be facilitated by the removal of the bathroom addition and the reintroduction of access from the former door in the south west corner. Introduction of more natural light behind the sideboard alcove would greatly enhance the lighting of the space and appearance of the leadlighting details and should be encouraged. Main stair Although the main stair from Ground to First Floor may be original it may also have been a new stair installed as part of the 1913 renovatio,. The residence apparently was in some state of disrepair by the time of Brunton's purchase and the replacement of the stair may have been a requirement. Certainly the stair that continues from the First Floor to the attic and roof space was not part of the original fabric and probably was not included in the renovations. The continuation of the stair width to a secondary service space and the visual cutting of the stained glass window is uncharacteristic of the earlier period. However, the consistency of detailing between this and the lower stair does not preclude its inclusion in Brunton's renovations. It may have come about due to the requirement for accommodation of the servant facilities within the dwelling. The placement of an electrical bell board at the top of the stairs support such a contention, as does the dormer window on the northern section of the roof which does not appear on the photograph of the property dating . The original roofline over the stairwell has been raised as evidenced by the external timber shingle lining and confirms that the present stair configuration may not be original. The stained glass window of the stairwell again is by Lyon & Cottier and contains some fine figure and geometric detailing. Gordon's monogram and heraldic motif are also to be found within the glass detailing. Dating from they should retained. Cloak room This room and its corresponding room on the First Floor is an extension to the building dating from the 1913 renovations. Originally this may have been the location for the toilet and bathing facilities for the main household. The Water Board Plan indicates that there may have been a covered structure in this location but does not indicate material of construction. Certainly it was conveniently positioned for service access from the servant block courtyard. It appears to have been fitted out as a Cloak Room and toilet facility accessible from the main hallway as well as having connecting access to the Dining/Ballroom via a covered verandah. The floor and wall tiles with their ornamental wall and floor border treatment have a certain charm. However, the tiling is generally in a bad state of repair and is not of particular significance. The full length marble shelf, however, should be retained for adaptation in future works. Managers flat/verandah/access to dining room via western door Originally this was external to the building, following the 1913 dining room addition a covered verandah served as access from this room to the cloak room/bathroom. The imprint of the verandah is still apparent as the passage behind the main stair servicing the \\"Managers Flat\\". This brick and concrete roof extension dates from around 1939 and is deemed to be of no significance. Boudoir All the internal work within this room dates from the 1913 renovations. It would appear that the decoration of this room and the second drawing room were influenced by Brunton's wife Eleanor working in conjunction with Howard Joseland. This room as with G11 is at odds with the more public rooms of the dwelling and its joinery is more closely aligned to that of common features of the Federation period. The fittings within the room have been modified to some degree. The window seat on the east has been removed, as has a cupboard on the western side of the fireplace that followed the detailing of the window seat, now replaced with a cupboard of recent construction. The white painted Federation style timber work appears to have been part of the original scheme and the timber architraves are consistent with Federation detailing. It is unlikely that the general aspect of the room can be restored, considering the self-contained nature of the room with harbour views has been lost. It may be possible to retain portions of this work although this retention would only be of nostalgic value. With the construction of the eastern extension and replacement of the western window with a door opening, the function of the room has been substantially altered. Formerly a private room with an external view to the west; it has since 1939 served as a transit space being an extension of the main passage connecting the original residence to the western extension. Drawing room The internal appearance of the front drawing room is a product of the 1913 renovation, however, it has been subdivided into two spaces with the installation of a partition wall that stops short of the ceiling. A bathroom has been installed in the north-west corner. The partition has been installed post 1938 as the room is shown on the Perini drawings in its original plan form. The partitions and bathroom installations are considered to be intrusive elements. The ceiling contains a pattern carried out in timber that continues down the walls at the corners of the room. Although the timber work may have been by Joseland its variance in style with the other public rooms suggests that it may be a later renovation, perhaps at its conversion into a Billiard Room as indicated on the Dobson drawings of 1938. The timber picture rail frieze continues across the partition wall and suggests that the room has undergone numerous renovation over time. The fireplace with its framed mirror over is Victorian in character and differs from the others in the public rooms of the Ground Floor. The fireplace as those in G11, F4 and F11 may be original, further investigation would be required not as ornamented or worked as others within the house. The mirror over appears to have been a later addition, perhaps dating from the Brunton renovations. It is unlikely that his was the original location of the fireplace as there is no chimney or flue over the services this facility. It is likely that a fireplace was positioned on the western wall back-to-back with the study fireplace but this cannot be accurately ascertained from a visual inspection. The cornices are not consistent with the other Ground Floor rooms and may predate the Joseland renovations, however, given the extent of area (i.e. ceiling and walls) treated with the timber panelling the cornices may have been included when this work was done. A door connects this room to the Study, its architraves are deeply moulded and are fine examples of joiners works dating from the Joseland renovations. Study The fit-out of the study is also a product of the Brunton renovations. The timber dado wall panelling each contain a circular embossed copper detail. These are believed to be depictions of \\"the three link cable which was invented by an ancestor\\" of J. S. Brunton, a General Brunton in 1399. This date is repeated on the hall fireplace and reinforce Brunton's concern for a personal iconography that reinforced his family ancestry. The timber fireplace is another example of Joseland's hand. It contains a carved heraldic device with a Latin inscription below, that reads Pax Mentis Incendium Gloriae, this may have been transcribed in error for the motto of another arm of the Brunton family reads Fax Mentis Incendium Gloriae, meaning \\"the torch of glory inflames the mind\\". The ceiling repeats the exposed timber beam motif that characterises the other main rooms. Verandah vestibule The verandah vestibule/passage contains a pressed metal ceiling in good condition. This post-dates the original construction but together with the cornices and perhaps rose, may have formed part of the 1913 renovations. The suspended light fitting is from this period. The door openings that led to the study and drawing room have been filled as cupboard space. Both sets of doors that lead from the main hall and onto the verandah are fine examples of joiners work. The verandah doors are in all likelihood original in form, however the main passage sets of doors may have been a Joseland invention, as they are not consistent in their Gothic detailing. The walls have been papered to picture rail height, the awkward manner in which the picture rail meets the door architraves suggests that these date from a later refurbishment than the 1913 works. Drawing room (west) The drawing room like the boudoir has also been greatly affected by the western extension. Here again with the removal of the western window and replacement with a door opening providing access to the 1938 extension the self-contained nature of the room has been lost. This is further compromised by the loss of view to the north resulting from the subdivision and to the west by the construction of the 1938 extension. The fit-out of the room again by Joseland is in high contract to the other main rooms at the front of the building and continues the theme established in the boudoir. The room has been painted and wall papered in recent times. The appearance of the room following Joseland's renovations may be found in a photograph taken in the 1920s and indicates the importance of the western window to the room. On the eastern wall is an early Victorian white Carrara marble surround and cast iron fireplace with marble hearth which may date from the original building and are worthy of retention. Joseland's design for the room is in contrast to the other main rooms. Although the wall panelling and architraves are a common motif, the panelling and plaster ceiling details appear as a filigree beading and is not of significance other than as a part of the composite 1913 renovations. Recommendations for its on-going treatment are similar to those of the Boudoir. Northern verandah The northern verandah is substantially in its original 1862 form with its stone pillars and timber Gothic arches. The tessellated floor tiles are generally in good condition and were installed as part of the Joseland works. The end walls have been disfigured by the installation of the service pipes for the bathrooms installed on the first floor of the verandah. The lantern light fittings were designed by Joseland, and the marble steps probably dates from his renovation works. The aspect from the ground floor verandah has been irreparably affected by the subdivision of the property. The former orientation of the building to a northern view no longer has any relationship to the bay which was intrinsic to its planning. The placement of bathrooms on the first floor verandah are unsightly and intrusive additions to the external fabric. Considering this is now the only vantage point from which a view may be obtained and the only visible section from the bay these additions should be removed. The Gothic detailed balustrading is still intact to two bays with the end bay filled by unsympathetic timber lining boards and glazed partition. The missing balustrading should be reinstated and the verandah bathrooms removed. This would have a consequent result in the removal of the unsightly pipework that now covers the face of the end walls. Western extension The western extension dates from 1938 and was carried out by the builder/developer F. L. Perini following his purchase of the property. The architect responsible for the documentation was J. A. Dobson and Bondi Junction. The extension, is constructed on original stonework that may have been reused following the demolition of the service wing. In its design a simplistic attempt was made to be sympathetic to the original building. However, its \\"modern\\" interpretation of castellated Gothic is at odds with the picturesque perpendicular Gothic of the original building. This may be evidenced in the removal of the original western stone turret and replacement with one of varying style in brick and render. Although the lined ashlar treatment of the external concrete render and the window mouldings present on the northern facade are attempts to reflect the visual appearance of the original building the superficial nature of the copy is reflected in the flatness, lack of texture and obvious difference in material lacks the richness of the original. The western extension resulted also in the removal of windows to the original facade that provided a harbour view and altered the planning and circulation pattern of the original residence. The scale of the building relative to the original house, the changes it necessitated to the original 1860s north facade and the poor consideration of the connection between it and the original building all diminish its overall value. Its role as hotel accommodation led to the programmatic use of details throughout the wing that are not commensurate with the craftsmanship of the original building and some of the subsequent Brunton renovations. The provision of the metal framed verandah's in the 1980s assist to reduce the scale of the western facade, however, their detailing and construction are unsympathetic additions. Hence it is deemed that the western extension is of little significance and may be removed or provide the opportunity of adaption to retain the fabric of the original building. It should, however, be borne in mind that the construction of this extension has been the primary reason for the preservation of the original structure and intactness of the interior fittings. Although the demolition of this extension would greatly enhance the building and go towards returning the building to its \\"original\\" outline, the viability for the preservation of the original building may be greatly compromised in so doing. First floor The First Floor area has been greatly altered over time, such changes include: * 1913 additions in the construction of the bedroom and service wing on the south- east, and the construction of a bathroom west of the main stairwell. * 1913 refurbishment of internal finishes including plaster trims, joinery and fireplace surrounds. * post 1927(?) installation of attic stair and service block * 1938 subdivision of rooms for guest house accommodation and provision of bathrooms * 1938 construction of western wing, removal of original western windows and provision of openings to service new addition. * post 1938 subdivision of areas in provision of bathrooms during its time as a private hotel. As such little of the internal aspect of the First Floor can be attributed as being original. Rooms F6-F8 dating from 1913 may have been used as staff facilities as the 1938 Perini drawings indicate that there may have been an external door on the southern wall. This area has been further subdivided through partitions with the bathrooms showing subsequent refurbishment. The spatial arrangement of the First Floor has been substantially altered; the main stair originally stopped at this level and has been extended c.1927. The double doors that terminate the eastern axis of the Hall are late additions following the 1938 conversion for Hotel accommodation. It appears that most of the internal finishes are either a product of the 1913 or post 1938 renovation works. Cornicing in Rooms F3 and F16 with their deeply moulded and fluted surfaces are in contrast to the much simpler forms in the other rooms that match those in the Hall. This cornicing carries around the bathroom walls which were installed c. 1938, and may be copies. The fireplace surrounds in Rooms F6, F11 and F16 are Federation in details and appear to be 1913 replacement echoing Joseland's work in the Ground Floor Boudoir. Most of the fittings in the Bathroom (F14) have been removed and the installation of the now damaged \\"column enclosed\\" pan confirms that the internal fitout dates from around 1913. The room is in a bad state of repair, with significant water damage to ceilings and walls. The western extension has resulted in the removal of windows and replacement with openings or the bricking up of former windows. This is the case for the western wall of the Hall and that of Room F16 where the outline of the former window and window blocks are still visible. The outlook from the main bedrooms have been disfigured by the installation of a bathroom and enclosure of part of the verandah. These probably date from around the 1950s and their removal would facilitate the renewal of the buildings relationship with the Bay. All the rooms are in some state of disrepair with various degrees of water penetration and damage to the ceilings. Efforts should be made as a matter of priority to ensure the watertightness of the roof to avoid further deterioration of the building. Attic/roof space The roof space attic was probably converted into accommodation following the subdivision of the property in 1927 which may have resulted in the requirement for additional accommodation within the main building. The dormer window on the north does not appear on any of the early photographs, the latest around 1913. A measured drawing dated April 1980 indicate that there were supplementary divisions of the space into bedrooms. The walls and ceiling were formerly lined in lathe and plaster and the nails that remain are of recent 20th century origin. Some of the stone walls that divided the roof space have been demolished in recent times together with the continuation of chimneys from the Ground Floor. These should be rebuilt to enable lower level fireplaces to continue to operate.  Modifications and dates  See description for several modifications, including: *Original 19th century land holding was little over *1913+extensive alterations *1927property subdivided into 14 allotments with \\"Gladswood\\" being Lot 6. The holding for \\"Gladswood\\" was limited more or less to its building line whilst retaining a portion of land that formed its northern aspect over Double Bay. This may have been when the stable/ coach house was separated from Gladswood - today this building survives on no. 21 Gladswood Gardens, to the south of the main building. *1935buy back of Lot 5 to extend Gladswood's holding which has access to the pier. *1938established its existing holding. Perini converted the residence along with building a substantial western addition for \\"multiple occupancy\\"; *1939- 1950sleased and operated the building as a \\"Guest House'. *Ian Joye's Coronet Investments develop a \\"European-inspired\\" block of three three bedroom, two-level apartments behind (west of) Gladswood House.  Heritage listing  As at 24 January 2012, the fabric of the place is an element of the early subdivision of the \\"Point Piper Estate\\" and its development as a landmark harbour side estate. It was once a landmark on the point of Double Bay and still retains a relationship with the harbour. It represents an example of the popular picturesque harbour side \\"colonial Gothic taste\\" in building. It is one of the few surviving examples of the domestic work of the architect William Munro. It is associated with people of importance in cultural, political and commercial history of Australia and New South Wales including Sir Daniel Cooper, William Walker, Samuel Deane Gordon, Thomas Hussey Kelly, Thomas Herbert Kelly, John Spencer Brunton and R. G. Howard Joseland. Its asymmetrical planning and sitting is representative of a variance to the pointed \\"Gothic Plan type\\" in response to its harbour side location. The stained glass windows of the entry vestibule and stairwell date from around 1875 and are excellent examples of the work of the firm of Lyon and Cottier. Major alterations and additions dating from around 1913 in refurbishing the building have provided joinery and plaster work of excellent quality and craftsmanship. Of particular note are the fireplaces in the Entry Hall, and Dining Room/Ballroom and the feature plaster ceilings contained within these areas. The iconographical program undertaken in the 1913 interior refurbishment to Rooms G2, G3, G4, G9 and the stained glass and major joinery herein as described in the inventory of items provide a significant variant in their \\"Baronial program\\", to early twentieth century interior treatments. Gladswood House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Gladswood House is listed on the (now defunct) Australian Register of the National Estate. The Australian Heritage Commission's Statement of Significance cites it as a \\"Picturesque and historic home which has first class fittings and detail. Base of the original structure remains almost intact.\\" References= Bibliography   *  Attribution  Category:Houses in Sydney Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Sydney Category:Victorian architecture in Sydney Category:Residential buildings completed in 1864 Category:1864 establishments in Australia Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Double Bay, New South Wales Category:Apartment buildings in Australia Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register ","title":"Gladswood House"},{"id":"29202666","text":"The 40th Filmfare Awards were held in 1995 1942: A Love Story and Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!, considered one of the most successful films of Bollywood, led the ceremony with 13 nominations each, followed by Krantiveer with 7 nominations. 1942: A Love Story won 9 awards, thus becoming the most-awarded film at the ceremony.

The northwest-southeast trending anticline was caused by tectonic movements probably starting in the Upper Cretaceous.  Description of the structure  A cross-section through the Mareuil Anticline with vertical exaggeration The anticline was named after Mareuil, a small town in the northwestern Dordogne, France. The centre of the structure is near Sainte-Croix-de-Mareuil, somewhat farther to the northwest. In plan view the anticline has the shape of an elongated pear with its long axis aligned NW-SE and reaching about 5 km in length (the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary serving as a reference horizon). The short axis is only 2 km in length. The structure is doubly asymmetric, with steeper dipping northeastern and northwestern limbs. It is accompanied on its northeastern side by the Mareuil Fault, which starts at La Rochebeaucourt and continues to the north of Brant√¥me. Along this fault the northeastern side of the anticline was pushed up by about 30 m. On the southeastern side of the anticline, there are several smaller cross-cutting faults locally disturbing the angle of dip. These cross faults are all following Riedel directions, either the R- or the R'-position, hinting at an underlying shear zone.  Regional geology  Seen from the edge of the northeastern Aquitaine Basin, the Mareuil Anticline forms the first structural high within the sedimentary cover. It runs more or less parallel with the edge of the Massif Central, at a distance of about 15 km. The sedimentary cover reaches a thickness of altogether 400 m in the anticline. In the syncline on the northeast (the Combiers-Saint-Cr√©pin-de-Richemont Syncline), the sediments are 500 m thick. In the adjoining syncline on the southwestern side (the Gout-Rossignol- L√©guillac Syncline), the sediments reach 700 m in thickness. This is followed 8 km to the southwest by another anticlinal ridge, the La Tour-Blanche Anticline. In this second anticlinal ridge, the sediments already show a thickness of 1000 m. The Mareuil Anticline is a large-scale structure. To the northwest it changes into a fault zone that can be traced from Angoul√™me to Isle de Yeu. To the southeast it also changes into a fault zone running from Terrasson to Meyssac. It possibly continues into the Lacassagne Fault or even into the Souillac flexure.  Stratigraphy of the sedimentary sequence  In the core of the anticline the top 20 m of Upper Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) strata are exposed ‚Äî thinly bedded, cryptocrystalline, fossiliferous limestones (micrites). After a long hiatus follow 8‚Äì20 m of transgressive Cenomanian consisting of green, glauconitic marls rich in oysters and sandy, alveoline- bearing limestones. The Cenomanian is concordantly overlain by 55‚Äì65 m of Turonian strata divided into the nodular, chalky limestones of the Lig√©rian and the rudist-bearing limestones of the Angoumian. This is followed by 50‚Äì65 m of Coniacian ‚Äî mainly hard, fossiliferous limestones. The sequence finishes with 45‚Äì60 m of chalky, glauconitic Santonian, in places rich in oyster debris. The strata below the 120 m thick Kimmeridgian do not outcrop, but the presence of 210 m of underlying Oxfordian, Bajocian and Bathonian strata is known from drilling results in the vicinity. Whether thin Lias underlies the Dogger cannot be ascertained.  Age of movements  The northwestern edge of the Mareuil Anticline. The Turonian (Angoumian) cliff is dipping 35¬∞ to the NNE. The first movements in the region of the Mareuil Anticline must have occurred in the Lower Cretaceous because of the transgressive nature of the Cenomanian. But these movements were not specific to the anticline; they affected the entire northeastern Aquitaine Basin. Synsedimentary slumps in the Turonian strata near the anticline are a good indicator that the first tectonic stirrings had happened in the anticline. Yet the major event responsible for the creation of the structure clearly must have taken place after the Santonian, because the entire sedimentary sequence has been deformed by it. This major event is thought to have occurred at the end of the Campanian and during the Maastrichtian (end-Campanian-Maastrichtian event). But there is also a good possibility that the main orogenic event during the Eocene/Oligocene in the Pyrenees is somehow involved in the formation of the anticline. Like the Pyrenees, the Mareuil Anticline was created under compressive forces, maybe even under transpression. It is known that compressive forces responsible for the Pyrenean orogeny likewise affected the northeastern edge of the Massif Central (i.e. upthrusts within the Dogger can be seen in the quarry of Saint-Martial-de-Valette).  Structural observations  The Mareuil Anticline forms part of the anticlinal ridges within the northern Aquitaine Basin. These ridges follow a more or less northwesterly- southeasterly direction and run parallel to the South Armorican Shear Zone. Their age of formation is thought to be end-Campanian/Maastrichtian. Possibly they have a transpressive component and share with the South Armorican Shear Zone (SASZ) the same dextral sense of movement. Importantly they have a parallel alignment and a rather uniform spacing of 15‚Äì20 km. A local exception in this scheme is the La Tour-Blanche Anticline narrowing to a spacing of 8 km and following a WNW-ESE direction.  References  * Floc'h JP, et al.

Bronwyn Lea has written of Takolander's poetry: \\"Takolander‚Äôs poems are ruinous, diabolical, all the more so for their polish and precision. Here, as in Baudelaire, beauty is inextricably linked with evil: it‚Äôs 'the dark italics', as Wallace Stevens phrased it, that compels the poetic imagination in these poems ‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt be surprised if they take up residence in your body after reading them ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just that kind of book.\\" Geordie Williamson, the chief literary critic at The Australian, has written of The Double: \\"Takolander, though immured in the same darkling stuff as Plath, always remains in command. Hers are a series of thought experiments in which enduring Western narratives are recast according to the author's imaginative and philosophical inclinations. The results are fiercely intelligent and idiosyncratic, sometimes shot through with black humour, sometimes pressing down on the reader with the full weight of human horror...Individually, Takolander's stories can be bleak. But collectively they are thrilling. Slender as this collection may be, it announces the arrival of a considerable talent.\\".

He attended the boarding school in Gainford, Yorkshire and was then medically educated at University College, London and University College Hospital, where he qualified MB in 1865 and MD in 1873. He moved to Harrogate, Yorkshire and ran an extensive practice there from 1876 until his retirement in 1908. In 1887 he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and in 1896 delivered their Croonian Lecture on the subject of the circulation of the blood. In 1904 he founded the Oliver-Sharpey lectureship to promote physiological research by observation and experiment, and to encourage the application of physiological knowledge to the prevention and cure of disease and the prolongation of life (The lectureship was founded in honor of William Sharpey, who was Oliver's physiology professor at University College, London.) Oliver invented several instruments such as the haemoglobinometer, haemodynamometer and arteriometer. These instruments allowed him in 1893 to observe the effect an extract of sheep's adrenal gland had on human blood vessels. He continued the study of the glands of internal secretion, especially the suprarenals, in conjunction with Professor Edward Sch√§fer at University College. He died in retirement in Farnham, Surrey.

The village, which sits at the south-east edge of its civil parish, is approximately south-west from the small town of Great Dunmow, and north-west from High Roding. The civil parish contains the hamlets and small settlements of Hope End Green, Hellmans Cross, Bacon End, Baconend Green, and Puttocks End. The River Roding defines the parish border at the south-east, and for 1 mile cuts through the parish before providing part of the north-east border.  History  St Mary's Church Great Canfield civil parish contains Grade listed buildings and historic landscapes, and records dating to the Domesday Book. One entry found in the Domesday Book describes Great Canfield as having a \\"Value to the Lord in 1066 [of] ¬£6\\" and agricultural resources from years 1066 to 1086: \\"Meadow 51 acres. Woodland 160 pigs. 1 mill.\\" Great Canfield has historically a grounding in agricultural practices until recent years of industrialization and the re-distribution of work labour. Among other parishes found in England, Great Canfield is considered by many to be an important part of England's historic heritage. Great Canfield is one of 104 parishes within the scope of The Hundred Parishes Society, which covers \\"450 square miles of northwest Essex, northeast Hertfordshire and southern Cambridgeshire\\". The society aims to raise awareness of the area's character and history and conserve and protect its historic buildings, natural landscape and culture. St Mary's Church at Great Canfield is of particular interest. The church is typically Norman and thought to have been constructed between 1100-1150. It is described as being \\"in the shadow of an old Motte and Bailey and it was perhaps built on the site of an earlier church\\". The church contains a 13th-century painting of The Virgin Mary and baby Jesus, which is described as of \\"exceedingly good quality\\". St Mary's is part of a six-church Group ministry in west Essex--the other churches are St Mary the Virgin in Aythorpe Roding, St Andrews's in Halstead, St Mary the Virgin in High Easter, All Saints in High Roding, and The Church of St Margaret of St Antioch. The group shares a part-time priest who conducts services in each of the member churches. At the centre of Great Canfield village, south-east from the church, are the earthwork remains of Great Canfield Castle. The diameter and high remains are of a motte and bailey castle. The remains are set within a wooded area bounded south-east to north-east by a bend of the River Roding, a feed from which was used to supply water to the castle moat. Great Canfield Castle is documented from 1154 to 1216, and might be associated with the de Vere Earls of Oxford. Isaac Lodge, recipient of the Victoria Cross for action during the Second Boer War, was born in the village.  Population  Great Canfield population 1801-2011 Recorded from past census statistics; the population of Great Canfield has seen only one major decline in population, from its peak population of 511 in 1831, to 271 by 1901. Census data shows that a decline in population was consecutive with every recorded census between 1841 and 1901. An increase in population within Great Canfield after the census of 1841 was not recorded until 1911; the population rose from 271 recorded in 1901, to 305 by 1911- an increase of 34. Since the 1921 Census Great Canfield has seen regular increases in population, the greatest between the years 1921-1931 where there was an increase of 86, from 254 to 340. Since then the increases have been moderate. Housing Since 1801 housing levels have changed in line with changing population. During the 1800s, however, this was not the case. Between the years 1831-1881 Great Canfield recorded an increase in the total number of houses from 93 to 104; the population rate during this time decreased. In the 1900s the number of houses in Great Canfield increased: between 1921-1961 there was an increase in houses from 75 to 123 with consistent increases being reported at every census. The 2001 and 2011 censuses show an increase in the total number of houses within Great Canfield- the 2001 Census registered a total of 133 houses, and the 2011 Census, 156. This may be due to the pressure of increasing urban development within Great Canfield, however, such development remains widely rejected within the Great Canfield community. A scheme of 31 July 2014 proposed major residential development within Great Canfield with the building of a further 211 homes on the land west of Canfield Road. The proposal was refused on the 5 November 2014 by Uttlesford District Council.  Employment  Percentage of people working in different areas of industry within Great Canfield civil parish according to the 1881 Census Pie chart showing the distribution of occupational data for Great Canfield in 2011 Historically the measurement of employment within parishes such as Great Canfield has been varied in terms of categorizing workers within different industries. The 1801 Census primarily recorded levels of occupation by \\"those 'chiefly employed in agriculture', those 'chiefly employed in trade, manufacturers or handicraft', and others\\". By the census of 1841 the recording of occupational data had moved on from categorizing workers into 4 broad areas of industry 'and others'; the census now \\"listed over 3000 different occupational titles\\". This allowed for future census data to categorize these approximately 3000 job titles into more varied and accurate areas of industry. By the census of 1881 the occupational data for parishes such as Great Canfield was more organised then previous census data: By 1881 Great Canfield had a working population of around 167, the majority within agriculture, and employed by farmers and land owners as labourers and to tend crops; this accounted for 47% of the working population of Great Canfield. The fact the majority of workers were employed within the agricultural industry reflects the social demographics of the occupants living in Great Canfield during the 1800s, the majority of people would have fallen under the 'labourers & servants' social status with little education and no professional trade. The second majority which was 30% of Great Canfield's workforce in 1881, falls under the 'unknown'- this does not just suggest unemployment but reflects the inconsistency of the census data during this time period in terms of jobs that do not fall under any title, or occupants not accurately recording their job title. A percentage of those under the 'unknown' section would have fallen under the unemployed sector. Within the 1800s it is accurate to state that Great Canfield was mostly made up of people employed within the agricultural industry, most of whom would have been on a low income. Occupational distribution of Great Canfield based on the 2011 Census shows the majority percentage of employment is within the 'Managers, Directors and Senior Officials' sector with 21% of the working population within this sector. The second majority in distribution of employment as of the 2011 Census is within the 'skilled trades occupations' sector- making up 17% of the working population. A change from Great Canfield's distribution of employment in 1881 until 2011 is the percentage of employment within the 'professional occupations', the distribution within this sector in 1881 was 2% of Great Canfield's working population, the distribution in 'professional occupations' in 2011 was 15%- an increase of 13%. The type of sectors since 1881 has changed over 130 years, emergence of technology has allowed new job titles and industries to be created and other industries to decrease such as Great Canfield's agricultural industry.

It was designed by William Hardy Wilson and built from 1913 to 1936 by Rudolph G. Ochs. The property is owned by The Eryldene Trust. The house and its garden, which is noted for its camellias was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 and was listed on the (now defunct) Australian Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, p. 2/33  History  The real spirit of the 20th century came to Australian architecture with the domestic work of a quartet of practitioners after the World War I. Between them, they encompassed all the virtues and the vices, the strengths and the weaknesses which have marked the last 50 years. The only thing they had in common was a conviction that architectural thinking had to start at a more basic level than anything that had been known for a hundred years. The group of thinking-architects responsible for ushering in the 20th century were Hardy Wilson, Robin Dods, Harold Desbrowe-Annear and Walter Burley Griffin. They worked in different places and they worked individually. But between them, they covered most of the ideas and attitudes that followed. Because, with the exception of Griffin, they worked almost exclusively on houses, their effect was strongest on domestic work. The same depth of thought and changes which they brought to homes did not begin to percolate into other types of building, which merely acquired from them the vices of individualism to compound their blatant stylism, for another 40 years. William Hardy Wilson William (later Hardy) Wilson had been born in Sydney in 1881. His search for architectural truth, a deep love and appreciation of beauty, an interest in history and an abiding faith in the concept of the artist-architect led him to strive for the pre-Victorian virtues. But his was not mere copyism. Sensitive to the underlying qualities of colonial architecture, he sought to apply their timeless principles to his own work.Freeland, 1982, 236-8 In 1905 Wilson went to England and enrolled in the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London and also worked as a draftsman for William Flockhart in Bond Street. The chief draftsman in that office, Leonard Rothrie, introduced him to the Chelsea Art Club, where he met English sculptor Francis Derwent Ward and Scottish painter George Henry, as well as Australian artists including Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and George Lambert. In 1908 Wilson and Stacy Neave (another architect from Sydney) commenced their grand tour of Europe and North America, where they found the work of McKim, Mead & White and the American Colonial Revival style particularly impressive. It was during this tour that Wilson realised the influence of geography was crucial to the development of art and architecture. In 1911 Wilson changed his name legally to William Hardy Wilson and joined Neave to form Wilson & Neave. When Neave served in World War 1, Wilson closed the practice and concentrated on writing and completing his drawings of old colonial architecture in NSW and Tasmania and building his own house, Purulia (completed 1916).Edwards, 2013, 768 The positioning of the summer house at Purulia, on the cross-axis of the central path and diagonally to the right of the front door, is similar to the positioning of the more sophisticated one at Eryldene. The simple stone- flagged central path is common to all the gardens, yet it is a cottage detail, not found in the old colonial gardens of the County of Cumberland which Wilson knew.Broadbent, in National Trust of Australia (NSW), 1980, 65-70. Another notable Wilson designed house of this era was Macquarie Cottage, Pymble (1919) for H. Dunstan Vane.Edwards, 2013, 769 In 1920 Wilson & Neave took on John Berry as partner, becoming Wilson, Neave & Berry (1920‚Äì27), a firm noted for the Colonial Revival style of architecture for domestic design: fat, low- squatting Georgian boxes with colonnaded verandahs, spider-web fanlights on entrance doors and multi-paned windows with shutters. The firm's style followed the Colonial Revival based on the United States idiom, but also looked to Australian colonial architecture for inspiration. This style became very popular in the 1920s.Edwards, 2013, 770 In 1921 Wilson went to China and took lessons in Chinese painting under Kungpah King (Jin Chen); his travels to China's major cities, Peking (Beijing), Hangzhou, Shanghai, Canton (Guangshou) and Macao had a profound influence in his architectural philosophy and design. After Wilson's visit to China in 1921, the firm incorporated Oriental motifs and details, examples of which are found at Eryldene, Gordon (1914‚Äì36) and Peapes Department Store, Sydney (1923). In 1922 Wilson sold Purulia and travelled to England and Europe, where, in Vienna, he supervised the collotype reproductions for \\"Colonial architecture in NSW and Tasmania\\" (1924), his publication that would foster great interest in an Australian Colonial Revival. In 1925 Wilson returned to Sydney, where he became disillusioned with the state of Australian architecture and began writing his view sand ideas in a fictionalised biography \\"The dawn of a new civilisation\\" (1929) under a pseudonym of Richard Le Mesurer. In 1927 he completed his last design ‚Äì the tennis pavilion (later called the Tea House) at Eryldene in Gordon for Prof. E.G. and Janet Waterhouse ‚Äì the epitome of \\"a new style in architecture, the development in one style of Chinese and European classic\\", retired from practice and left for England.Edwards, 2013, 769, 770 Eben Gowrie Waterhouse and Janet Waterhouse Eryldene was built in 1913‚Äì1914 for Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse (1881‚Äì1977) (commonly known as E. G. Waterhouse) and Mrs Janet Waterhouse and named after the house in Kilmarnock, Scotland where they married. Designed by William Hardy Wilson, it reflects his interest in the Georgian Revival style of architecture, adapted for Australian conditions. Professor Waterhouse also had a distinct influence upon the design of the house and is responsible for the simple hipped roof now apparent, rather than the gables often favoured by Wilson. E. G. Waterhouse was a linguist and from 1924 Professor of German at Sydney University, as well as being an avid gardener at his home, Eryldene and (later) a leading world authority on camellias. Eryldene's garden was increasingly a collection of camellias, many that he'd collected in Japan and China and all individually labelled, bilingually. The garden was designed by both Wilson and Waterhouse. Conceived as an extension of the house with particular \\"rooms\\", it was to become an expression of Waterhouse's individual character. It is now well known for its introduction of camellias back into the twentieth-century garden. In seeking out and drawing the buildings for his \\"Old Colonial Architecture in New South Wales and Tasmania\\", Hardy Wilson became aware of the siting and gardens of early colonial houses. He was the first to recognise and appreciate a characteristic mid-19th-century style of gardening in New South Wales. For nearly 50 years his was the only voice stressing its importance and his descriptions - as vivid and full blown as the late summer gardens he visited - are still the most evocative. Wilson looked at these gardens with a painter's eye, not the analytical eye of a designer. He was neither botanist nor horticulturist. He appreciated their siting, colour and texture rather than their layout and details. Of large forest trees he admired only the picturesque angophora (A.floribunda or A.subvelutina), the \\"apple oak\\" of the colonists; and, presumably the turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera) which he planted along the rear boundaries of Purulia. He designed five gardens: Eryldene (Gordon), Purulia, Macquarie Cottage (Pymble), a garden for \\"An Ideal Australian Home\\" and for a \\"Standard Cottage\\" for the William Moore Trust at Gordon. The latter were not carried out. Purulia and Macquarie Cottage have been altered. Eryldene presents a problem as in its final form it displays so much the taste and horticultural expertise of its owner, Professor Waterhouse, that Wilson's contribution is difficult to assess, and since it predates the other gardens, the influence of \\"Professor Pymble\\" on these should be considered. The similarities between all Wilson's garden plans are marked. From his love and knowledge of colonial gardens came his choice of plants. The range is limited, but it contrasts with the ubiquitous palms, brush box and hybrid roses of contemporary gardens as stringkingly as his unbroken colour-washed walls contrasted with the redness of his neighbours' \\"multangular villas\\". Waterhouse managed to acquire twelve advanced Camellia japonica cultivar (cv.) plants high in 1914 and planted six in the garden at Eryldene: two at the front gate, two in front of the garden temple, and two in the courtyard; and gave six to Hardy Wilson. This is mentioned in the book \\"E G Waterhouse of Eryldene\\" by Mary ArmatiFine Arts Press 1977 reprinted by the Eryldene Trust 2004, p37 which says: This quote was read and approved by him before his death in 1977.Penny Holden, pers.comm., 3 August 2012 In the early 1920s he was asked by the vice chancellor of Sydney University, Professor McCallum, to lay out a garden in the Vice Chancellor's courtyard. Here he planted a number of twenty-year-old azaleas, some fuschias and some camellias. The camellia had been the subject of a \\"rage\\" in gardening and botanical circles between its first \\"discovery\\" and export to the west. By the 1870s Australia was at the cutting edge of Camellia hybridisation and cultivar naming, along with England, Antwerp/Belgian and Florence/Italian breeding. By the 1890s camellias were waning in popularity, starting a slide lasting till the 1930s. Waterhouse's interest from 1914 was well before 1937, when English writer Sacheverell Sitwell's book Old Fashioned Flowers included camellias, leading to a revival in growing them.Read, 2012 The genus \\"Camellia\\" was named (i.e., published) by the great Carl Linne (Linnaeus) in 1735, in his Systema Naturae, for a plant described in (surgeon to the Dutch East India Company, Engelbert) Kaempfer's Amoenitatum Exoticarum 1712. More species have been \\"discovered\\", exported and named since as investigation has continued in China, Japan, Burma and Indo-China. Vietnam is yielding more species, including purple-flowered, in recent years. The name was in honour of Jesuit apothecary and naturalist from Moravia (now Czech Republic) Georg Josef Kamel, who worked in the Philippines in the early 18th century. The most important species are C. japonica and C. sasanqua (first \\"discovered\\" in Japan but the former also native to Korea, and both long cultivated in China) and C. reticulata from China. Species used recently in inter-specific hybridising which have produced some excellent cultivars are C. saluenensis, C. pitardii var. yunnanica, C. granthamiana and C. fraterna. In 1921 a garden retreat was built for the Professor's use. The curved wall and fountain in sandstone outside (east of) the garden retreat/ study was designed by Hardy Wilson and built in 1921. The glass-fronted bookcases inside were designed by Wilson's partner, John L. Berry. In 1924, after a trip to China, the professor commissioned the design and construction of a tea house and \\"Moon Gate\\" as an adjunct to the tennis court. After the Second World War, Waterhouse retired as Professor of French and German at Sydney University, and began Camellia Grove Nursery at St. Ives.Davis, 1988, 248 This was Camellia Grove No.4 in Australian garden history. The first was begun by Robert Henderson who died in 1865 and was located in Newtown. The second was Alexander Hunter's Camellia Grove (1870) at LIverpool Road, Ashfield and the third was at Parramatta (in the suburb now called , established by Silas Sheather before 1877. Sheather had been employed by the Macarthurs and was influenced by his experience with the Camden Park seedlings. At his Parramatta nursery he grew and offered for sale in 1877 imported cultivars and some of his own seedlings which included \\"Harriet Beeecher Sheather\\", \\"Myrtifolia\\", \\"Prince Frederick William\\" and the informal \\"Countess of Orkney\\", all included in his catalogue and represented at Eryldene. Earlier in 1862 Shepherd and Co. listed C. j.'Azura' , \\"Leviathan\\" and C. speciosissima, all of which the Professor tracked down. Alexander Hunter had served an apprenticeship as a nurseryman with Shepherd and Co. at their Chatsworth nursery at Rooty Hill and his introductions include \\"Constance\\", \\"Jean Lynne\\", \\"Edith Linton\\", \\"Ruth Kemp\\", \\"Mrs Swan\\", 'Brodie's Pink' and \\"Alexander Hunter\\". \\"Mrs Swan\\" was lost from Eryldene after the Professor's death when a plumber cut through its root zone to install a stormwater drain. Hunter sold or left Mr. G.C. Linton a property called Kewita at Somersby. Waterhouse gave the camellia world his new hybrid seedlings known as the \\"Waterhouse williamsii\\" hybrids. \\"Margaret Waterhouse\\", named for his daughter in law, proved hardier than the lovely pink formal named \\"E.G.Waterhouse\\". Camellia Grove Nursery is now at 8 Cattai Ridge Road, Glenorie. Waterhouse's collection of camellias is a living history museum that represents the introduction and development of the camellia. In 1945 Waterhouse's first volume on camellias \\"Camellia Trail\\", later to be followed by a second, \\"Camellia Quest\\" was published in a strictly limited edition by Sydney Ure Smith. Each copy was signed by the Professor and participating artists Adrian Feint and Paul Jones. These books are now collector's items. His story of the camellia in Australia included Alexander Macleay of Elizabeth Bay House (from the 1830s) and the Macarthurs of Camden Park, particularly William (also from the 1830s), propagating by layering and distributing imported varieties to nurserymen and private growers in NSW, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia. William Macarthur raised and named 67 seedlings at Camden Park and a number of these were distributed. He notes the role of nurseryman Michael Guilfoyle of the \\"Exotic Nursery\\" in Double Bay, whose 1866 catalogue listed 95 varieties of camellia, all grafted. Macleay and Macarthur both encouraged Sydney's first nurseryman, Thomas Shepherd, whose Darling Nursery company's 1851 catalogue listed 33 camellias. All were C. japonica cv.s except for one C. sasanqua (autumn camellia). Because few nurseries bothered to grow camellias from 1900 onwards Waterhouse often resorted to rescuing them from demolition sites. The first six were brought to Eryldene by means of a dray. \\"Aspasia\\" (a Macarthur variety) and \\"Great Eastern\\", a seedling of unknown origin, but still popular today, were among the first he acquired.Davis, 1988, 246-7 In 1950 Waterhouse with Sydney nurseryman Walter Hazlewood, Alex Jessup (former Director, Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne) and Dr Merrilees, founded the Australian Camellia Research Society. This has a worldwide membership of 1500 and in partnership with Sutherland Shire Council and the Sutherland Orchid Society was responsible for establishment of the E. G. Waterhouse National Camellia Gardens as a Bicentennial project in 1970 with Sutherland Shire Council. Since the World War II the genus Camellia has enjoyed an unprecedented revival due in no small measure to the untiring efforts of the late Professor, both in Australia and in every country suited to its cultivation. Waterhouse died aged 96 on August 17, 1977, by which time over 700 camellia varieties had been accommodated in Eryldene's garden, which had completely changed in character from its original cottage garden semi- formal layout. After the Professor's death, ownership eventually reverted to the Eryldene Trust in 1979. Conservation work was undertaken between 1982 and 1983 and provisions were made to accommodate a resident custodian. The house is now open to the public (since 1991) as an exhibition space and open garden.Moore et.al., 1988, 3-5 In seeking out and drawing the buildings for his \\"Old Colonial Architecture in New South Wales and Tasmania\\", Hardy Wilson became aware of the siting and gardens of early colonial houses. He was the first to recognise and appreciate a characteristic mid-19th-century style of gardening in New South Wales.

He designed 5 gardens: Eryldene (Gordon), Purulia, Macquarie Cottage (Pymble), a garden for \\"An Ideal Australian Home\\" and for a \\"Standard Cottage\\" for the William Moore Trust at Gordon. The latter were not carried out. Purulia and Macquarie Cottage have been altered. Eryldene presents a problem as in its final form it displays so much the taste and horticultural expertise of its owner, Professor Waterhouse, that Wilson's contribution is difficult to assess, and since it predates the other gardens, the influence of \\"Professor Pymble\\" on these should be considered. The similarities between all Wilson's garden plans are marked. From his love and knowledge of colonial gardens came his choice of plants. The range is limited, but it contrasts with the ubiquitous palms, brush box and hybrid roses of contemporary gardens as strikingly as his unbroken colour-washed walls contrasted with the redness of his neighbours' \\"multangular villas\\". Wilson planned his gardens with layouts of an easy, but nevertheless rigorously applied formal geometry, which owes little to colonial or contemporary English garden design (to which Wilson makes no reference in any of his writings). They are unmistakably gardens designed by an architect who, though admiring the architectural work of Lutyens, probably knew little of current English gardens. The positioning of the summer house at Purulia, on the cross-axis of the central path and diagonally to the right of the front door, is similar to the positioning of the more sophisticated one at Eryldene. The simple stone-flagged central path is common to all the gardens, yet it is a cottage detail, not found in the old colonial gardens of the County of Cumberland which Wilson knew.  Description =Garden Garden study The house was designed to link with its formal garden setting, which was laid out by Wilson and Professor Waterhouse and is testimony to their shared interest in the Orient. There are garden structures designed by Wilson and others including a temple in the front garden (Wilson 1913); garden study, fountain and pigeon house (Wilson and his partner John L Berry 1921‚Äì22), garden shed (Berry 1924), tea house (Wilson 1927) and garage and moon gate (1936). The garden is geometrically, but not formally planned. A wooden picket fence and tightly clipped hedge, screen the garden from the street. An irregularly flagged path, edged by garden beds, leads to the stone front steps, flanked with iron railings. The entrance path separates the front garden into two lawned areas. On the left stands an open octagonal summerhouse of slim mid 19th century cast iron columns, supporting a pitched roof with terracotta shingles. In the same position at the rear of the house stands a pigeon house, a garden study and a fountain. To the right at the front is a lawn area, garden seat and whitewashed terracotta pots with large camellias and azaleas in it, the driveway at the western side to a single garage behind the house. To the right at the rear is an area of shrubbery, and a lawn tennis court entered through a moon gate set in the wire netting fence, and a Chinese tea house / Tennis Pavilion set between a pair of ornamental flag poles on the south-western boundary. Chinese ornaments and bowls are found throughout the garden.Moore et.al. 1988: 72, amended Read, S., Heritage Office, 2004 Large trees include a jacaranda at the front of the house on the left hand side, carefully pruned to accentuate the shadow effects of its branch tracery on the house's walls and large Sydney red gums (Angophora costata) at the rear. An original line of Lombardy poplars along the front fence has since been removed and replaced by African olive (Olea europaea var. Africana) hedging and native cypress pines (Callitris sp. - C. columellaris / C. rhomboidea) as vertical elements. The garden has an impressive collection of ornamental camellias (C. japonica and C. sasanqua cultivars), gathered by Professor Waterhouse over some years as a passion. Waterhouse bred hybrids, and was a renowned expert on camellia classification and naming. Many of the camellia shrubs in the garden have their original name labels on them, some in Japanese/Chinese characters as well as English. An example is the Camellia japonica \\"Altheiflora\\" a blood- red small semi-double flowered cultivar, with ruffled petals. Throughout the garden, careful use of axes, view manipulation, suggestion, surprise and architectural elements to \\"stop\\" views, or provide ornamental features along pathways have been carefully placed and maintained. House Early photograph of the entrance to Eryldene Interior Eryldene is a single storey brick house. Its design is an adaption of Georgian Architecture to Australian conditions. A central path, edged by garden beds, leads to the stone front steps, flanked with iron railings. The verandah with its six beechwood columns and white railings consists of three well-proportioned areas, terminated at each end by a weatherboard sleep-out bedroom. The roof is of shingle tiles with generous eaves. At the rear is a courtyard with a colonnade of Doric iron columns.Simpson 1976 Eryldene was built by Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse and his wife Janet. Professor Waterhouse was lecturer in modern languages and a renowned expert on camellias. It was the family home of entomologist Dr Doug Waterhouse (1916‚Äì2000). Eryldene was designed by William Hardy Wilson, Australia's leading advocate of the Old Colonial Georgian Revival movement, with major input from Prof. Waterhouse. It is a single storey cement rendered brick bungalow of conventional domestic construction with a hipped roof of terracotta roof shingle. Its symmetrical facade faces the formal garden frontage from which a central sandstone path and steps lead to an entrance verandah beneath the roof line. The verandah terminates at a loggia at each end and is broken up into five bays with wooden Doric columns placed at regular intervals, four of which are paired to mark the entrance at the centre. At the rear, the building wraps around a central courtyard framed by columns and open to the garden. Internally, a central hall separates two main rooms on either side. A hall at the rear echoes in plan the verandah and opens to the courtyard and the remaining rooms. The interior spaces are modest in scale and proportion. They are enriched by detailed elements inspired by colonial architecture researched by Wilson, including windows, doors and fanlights, architraves, skirtings, picture rails and mantelpieces.  Condition  Generally, the house and its contents are in good to excellent condition. The original furniture contents in the drawing room and dining room remain in situ. The original furniture and contents in the Garden Study remain in situ. The archaeological potential is negligible. The house, gardens and outbuildings are significantly intact, with some room settings retaining their original furnishings and detail.

In 1993, the house opened as a museum and operates under the administration of the Eryldene Trust. It is open to the public at set times from April to September.  Heritage listing  As at 12 June 2007, Eryldene is of outstanding cultural significance being the most intact surviving example of the work of William Hardy Wilson, the prominent early twentieth-century Australian architect, artist, writer and advocate of the Colonial Revival style. It comprises a residence, complementary outbuildings and garden setting, reflective of the close similarity of interests of both architect and client, Professor E. G. Waterhouse. The garden was developed by its owner to a remarkable individual character and was the setting for his world-renowned efforts in developing the nomenclature and hybridisation of camellias. It remains a resource for their study. The house, gardens and outbuildings are significantly intact, with some room settings retaining their original furnishings and detail.Moore et.al 1988:17 The place is also of considerable aesthetic significance for its demonstration of an exemplary example of a garden as an extension of a house, with a series of open air rooms carefully furnished with trees, shrubs and flowers, superbly proportioned garden structures (temple, garden study, teahouse/tennis pavilion, fountain, pigeon-house).Read, S., Heritage Office, 2004 Eryldene was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Eryldene has historical significance through its association with Professor E. G. Waterhouse who had a distinguished career in linguistics, arts and horticulture. It is also, arguably, the most significant surviving residence designed by William Hardy, celebrated for his influence on Australian architecture in the first half of the twentieth century.Moore et.al. 1988: 15 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. At all levels Eryldene is a sophisticated design entity, aimed at achieving a rare harmony of beauty and utility. It was created for the specific purpose of introducing aesthetic experience into the daily lives of its inhabitants and their visitors. It is one of the earliest, most complex and developed examples of the Colonial Revival style of architecture and the most complete example of its designers work remaining.Moore et.al. 1988: 16-17 The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Eryldene is not only a focus for admirers of Professor Waterhouse's life and works, it is also a remarkable evocation of a way of life and philosophy of living, increasingly remote from contemporary society. It also reflects cultured, intellectual life in Sydney from the First World War to the Modern period.Moore et.al. 1988: 16 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The camellia collection at Eryldene, remains living, evolving evidence of the Professor's contribution to the nomenclature and hybridisation of camellias and a resource for the future study of the genus.

It was built from 1824 to 1825 by Robert Cooper. The two-storey Old Colonial Georgian house was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 and is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate Juniper Hall was originally the home of Robert Cooper, a gin distiller. He reportedly designed the house himself and had it built circa 1825, including a cellar and attic in the structure. Unlike most Georgian homes, it features an upstairs balcony, which looks out onto Oxford Street. As time went by, Juniper Hall became hidden behind a row of commercial buildings on Oxford Street. A restoration project was undertaken by the National Trust of Australia in which the commercial buildings were demolished so Juniper Hall could be seen clearly, and it was fully restored by Clive Lucas Stapleton and Partners in 1988. The house is currently being used for the annual Doug Moran National Portrait Prize exhibition, a rotating calendar of exhibitions by portrait and photographic artists.  History =The suburb Paddington, which took its name from the London borough, lies in what were once paddocks adjacent to Victoria Barracks. It was the first of the early Sydney suburbs that was not self- sufficient - its inhabitants, unlike those of Balmain or Newtown, where work was available in local industries, had to go away each day to their places of employment. Development of the Eastern Suburbs (Edgecliff, Double Bay, Point Piper and Woollahra) surrounded this area with wealthy people's homes so this small hilly suburb lost all hope of harbour views. The area developed after a road was constructed to link up with a pilot station that was to be built at on South Head Road. John Palmer, the settlement's commissary, refused to allow people to cross his land grant at 'Woolloomooloo', so the road had to follow a roundabout way through Paddington to bypass his . Only a handful of workers lived in the area, and it was not until 1838, when it was decided to build a new military barracks in Paddington, that life came to the area. From 1848 when Victoria Barracks had been opened (designed by Lt.-Col.George Barney) and homes for the soldiers and their families had been erected, Paddington began to assume a real identity. The barracks site land was sandy - in fact a huge sandhill was located on the western side of the Greens Road area, and the foundation trenches had to be dug very deep, to locate firm stone for the foundations. Stone was mostly quarried in the area: the stonemasons were free settlers who had worked on erection of the Customs House at what was then Semi-Circular Quay. Once the soldieis and their families moved here, shopkeepers followed. Builders moved into the area and put up 3,800 houses between 1860 and 1890. These terraces give today's Paddington its air of individuality. The first school in the area was opened in the Presbyterian manse in Oxford Street, built in 1845. Today few of the area's original working class residents remain, as the suburb's proximity to the city has made it popular with business and professional people who prefer inner-city living in this historic area. The shopping centre, concentrated on the north side of Oxford Street, has also changed from one serving local needs to one of cafes, speciality shops and boutiques...Much of this is related to the changing population and the Village Bazaar, or Paddington Markets. The bazaar, which has operated since the mid 1970s, draws visitors from all over the city and has contributed to Paddington's development as one of Sydney's favourite tourist spots, along with Bondi Beach and The Rocks.Pollen, 1988, 195-7 Juniper HallRobert Cooper= It is hard to imagine that in 1822 the mansion Juniper Hall, on the eastern side of Oxford Street opposite the Paddington Reservoir and Paddington Town Hall and Paddington Post Office stood alone, without the many neighbours it has today. Set in a flagged garden, it had attic windows that gave panoramic views to Rushcutters Bay and Botany Bay. Juniper Hall was built for Robert Cooper, (distiller and emancipist merchant), who with partners James Underwood and Francis Ewen Forbes, received from Governor Brisbane in , covering the whole of north Paddington, and they agreed to erect three mansions and a distillery there. As part of their agreement, the three partners agreed to each take three acres for the erection of their own homes.Dunn, 2008 A distillery was built at the foot of Cascade Street near Taylor Square and Cooper bought out his partners, and only Juniper Hall was erected. The Coopers were part of the social scene of their day and entertained many notables of that time.Pollen, 1988, 195-197 Emancipist Robert Cooper (1776-1857) had lived a varied life as a gin-distiller, architect, builder, cedar cutter and wealthy London publican. He was transported in NSW in 1813 and granted a conditional pardon in 1818, by when he was eager to put down roots in the infant settlement, having joined in partnership with Underwood and Forbes, two fellow emancipists. Together with his third wife Sarah May, he built a house big enough to cope with 14 children (reputed to have increased to 20 by the time he died). He built the large two-storey house on a large block elevated above Sydney Harbour and Botany Bay.ACNT, 1988, 68 In June 1824 Cooper claimed that he was \\"at present building\\" Juniper Hall and there is evidence of his subsequent occupation of the place by April 1829. Cooper is said to have promised his third wife Sarah would have \\"the finest house in all the colony\\". No architect is known to be associated with the project but Cooper was himself a part-time builder and perfectly capable of producing the comparatively simple design and erecting it with the help of specialist tradesmen. He built a two-storey Victorian Georgian building with a basement. Four large rooms occupied each floor, while the basement contained the kitchen. To the rear were a coach house, stables and servants' quarters. The position on the top of the ridge line meant it had views across Sydney Harbour to the north and to Botany Bay to the south. He named his new home Juniper Hall, after the juniper berry used in gin's distillation, and recalling Juniper Street, the location of his former distillery in London. Cooper by this time needed a large dwelling, having 14 children from his first two marriages (both wives having died), with another 14 children to come from his union with Sarah. During the 1830s Cooper is likely to have made fashionable improvements to what had rapidly become an old-fashioned house. Cooper left Australia in 1831 with his wife and children for England and let the house to John Kinchela, an Irish lawyer who had arrived in June 1831 to take up the post of Attorney-General in the colony, recommended by his Irish patron, the Marquis of Ormonde. Kinchela renamed the house \\"Ormonde Hall\\" in honour of his patron. Kinchela himself stayed at Ormonde House only until 1838, when the returned Cooper family moved back in. The \\"e\\" was dropped shortly after and to this day the adjacent street is named Ormond Street. Cooper during the 1840s made an attempt to enter politics, standing for the first partially elected New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843. Despite building up to forty houses for his workers to make them eligible to vote, he failed disastrously, coming last on the ballot. Cooper blamed a sustained campaign against him in the conservative press, who had scrutinised his convict past and colourful career before the courts. In 1849, having over- speculated during that decade, he was declared bankrupt and forced to leave his house once more, mortgaging Ormond House in July 1848 for A¬£1,900. =Ormond House, private school for girls and other charitable uses= After the Coopers left the house was renamed \\"Ormond House\\" to dissociate itself from the gin image and passed through many hands. Its uses included a private school for girls.ACNT, 1988 In May 1852 Ormond House and land was leased to A. H. H. Stephen and James Comrie. Stephen was the Founding Secretary of the recently formed Society for the Relief of Destitute Children. Up to 130 children called Ormond House home during this time. In 1858 the Society removed the Asylum to the buildings designed for it by Edmund Blacket at Randwick. Ormond House was occupied from 1858 to 1884 by a number of lessees or tenants. Robert Cooper died in 1857 and in 1858 Sarah Cooper moved back into the house. Before she died in 1863, she refurbished the house, possibly with a view to selling it. On her death it passed to her trustees, who in turn leased it to a variety of charitable and educational organisations, including the NSW Institution for the Deaf and Dumb (1868‚Äì72), a ladies' college (1873-9) and the Children's Relief Board (1884-5). From available photographs it is evident that the layout of Juniper Hall's garden was altered in various minor ways between 1870 and 1920.Mayne-Wilson, 1992, 11 In the early 1880s the NSW Government adopted a new policy on poor and destitute children which favoured boarding those in Government care with selected foster parents. This meant that a central metropolitan \\"home\\" was needed where such children could be placed pending the selection of a foster home. To this end (a renamed) \\"Ormond House\\" was leased in the first half of 1884 as a \\"receiving house\\" and office for the State Children's Relief Board. The following year the government purchased the property for A¬£5,800 and it was to remain in Government ownership for forty years. During 1891 and 1892 substantial additions were carried out with a large addition to the eastern end. The extension was built in a similar style to the original, and used as the probation office for the Metropolitan Shelter for Children and the Children's Court, a role it maintained until 1921. This was NSW's first Children's Court. =Potential redevelopment and subsequent protection and conservation= In 1921 Joe Gardiner, the shoe manufacturer, purchased the property for demolition and redevelopment as flats and shops. There was such a public outcry that he changed his mind and turned the house into flats and built a row of six shops in (completely displacing) its front garden facing Oxford Street. Following Gardiner's bankruptcy the property was acquired by a Melbourne firm, Avrom Investments. At the end of World War II, an Avrom employee, Elizabeth Randall, was despatched to Sydney as a local manager. Two residents in the building interested her in its history and being a tough campaigner, she defended it successfully against the ravages of The Landlord and Tenant Act, termites, the elements, the Sydney City Council and Avrom. The defence against the last named threat was only achieved by a policy of improvement and rental increases which made Juniper Hall (as she renamed it) a paying proposition; a process which caused some distress to old established and theoretically protected tenants. Community groups such as the Paddington Society tirelessly campaigned for the conservation of Juniper Hall.Clement, 2014, 18 In 1981 an Interim Conservation Order was placed over the property. A detailed report on the history of the house and garden was prepared by James Kerr. A development proposal for the property prepared by Wills Denoon was considered by a new owner, Opera House Investments Pty Ltd but on 21 April 1982 ownership was transferred jointly to Manawar Pty Ltd and Golenat Pty Ltd. A development proposal on behalf of the new owners was proposed to convert the building to strata title.Kerr and Menzies, 1982 In 1983 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property. In 1984 the State Government gave $750,000 on a dollar for dollar basis to the National Trust towards the purchase and restoration of Juniper Hall. A Trust restoration project demolished the row of shops facing Oxford Street. Following Kerr's recommendations the property was conserved under the direction of Clive Lucas Stapleton & Partners architects. The works were completed in the Bicentennary Year 1988, incorporating reception rooms, offices, gallery space, major Australian Children's Museum, a National Trust (NSW) Gift Shop and public refreshment rooms. This was one of thirteen historic properties included in \\"A Gift to the Nation\\", sponsored solely by AMATIL Ltd. =Gardens= Juniper Hall's front garden was reinstated, aiming to present its approximate appearance . This work took place by National Trust of Australia (NSW) Garden Committee volunteers under the direction of Clive Lucas Stapleton & Partners, with research on the original layout and plant material and advice provided by James Broadbent and Michael Lehany, over the summer of 1987-8 in time for the January 1988 Australian Bicentenary celebrations. Photographs taken from the period of \\"Ormond House\\" gave the most reliable evidence of the form and extent of the garden, along with important clues remaining in the surviving frament of original ground along the front of the facade verandah (vestiges of old bitumen and brick-edged rails to the residence's front door). The photographs showed that the western section of the garden was relatively plain and functional, presumably as having been used as the children's and public entrance. The eastern section, used by the Superintendent, was maintained and planted to a higher standard. These differences in treatment have been followed in the layout and planting schemes recreated in 1987. Plants chosen were based on identification from photographs (where possible) and those known from plant nursery catalogues to have been sold by nurseries during that period, with a few substitutions: Moreton Bay fig in the original location in the front of the eastern garden was thought unwise in a smaller, more urban lot and setting, due to its huge scale. This was substituted with Magnolia grandiflora, which has a similar dark, large leaf and the advantage of large white scented flowers. Similarly yuccas (Spanish bayonets/Adam's needle) were thought unwise in grounds expected to be used and accessed by large numbers of people. These were substituted for Kaffir lilies (Clivia sp.). The front grounds were divided in two (in accordance with photographic evidence) by a painted picket fence, as they were when the property was a children's refuge. It was decided to recreate the western garden as a public garden planted to the Victorian taste. This has a path leading directly from one front gate to a front door, flanked by flower beds on either side. Popular plants of the period such as Agapanthus, foxgloves, chrysanthemums, shasta daisy, field poppies, Dianthus (pinks), Verbena, Kaffir lilies and sage (Salvia) were randomly planted here. Where evidence indicated, the original species was reinstated in the same place (e.g. a pair of Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla), Kaffir lilies and Agapanthus clumps either side of the central paths. A buffalo grass lawn was laid between central and perimeter garden beds. These latter were planted with flowering shrubs such as oleanders, Cape plumbago, sky flower (Duranta repens), Indian hawthorn (Raphiolepis), gardenias, jasmine, mock orange and Abelia, well as a flower border containing old-fashioned annuals of the period. The former superintendent's garden on the eastern side was recreated with the roundel reinstated in its centre. Paths led from the presumed front gate, around this circular bed, to end at the residence's front door. The rounded was edged with English box and filled with ubiquitous periwinkle (Vinca) as indicated in photographs. Within were planted several shrubs, typical of the era such as lavender, Camellia, Murraya, Michelia figo, Rothmannia amoena and yesterday-today and tomorrow (Brunfelsia). A large bank of Hydrangea macrophylla was planted along the front verandahs and a mixed shrubbery of Cape plumbago, jasmine and shell ginger plants were planted to screen the eastern boundary. =National Trust of Australia ownership= Juniper Hall from this time on was owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW), which determined that the Garden Committee under the leadership of Annie Ross, were ideally placed to reinstate the garden. Its members worked tirelessly to raise over $100,000 to finance the cost of this project. The perimeter fence was rebuilt, using iron pickets instead of the earlier corrugated iron capped fence - this was a political decision to enable greater views into the preorperty and encourage potential purchase of the front garden by Woollahra Municipal Council for use as public open space (this latter hope did not eventuate). A great quantity of old building rubble was dug out (dozens of cubic meters) and removed from the site. Dozens of cubic meters of non-saline soil were imported from Canberra (to avoid damage to the house's foundations). The Garden Committee completed the garden reinstatement work within a two-week period before 26/1/1988, working eight to ten members to a shift, in fierce January heat. Maintenance of the garden was taken over by the Juniper Hall Committee, formed in 1989. It too raised funds, some of which were used to maintain the garden. The greatest source of plants was from donations, helping the recreated garden regain its variety and richness, subject to species being suitable for the period chosen. The grounds at the rear were economically adapted by the Garden Committee from what remained of the old residential flat gardens to form good functional outdoor spaces. Parking demanded by Council was accommodated in the gravelled service area. Since the garden has been maintained by volunteers (all trained horticulturists) and a paid gardener. Some of the fencing shown in early photographs that kept the children out of both gardens has not yet been reinstated.Mayne-Wilson, 2012, 11-13 Juniper Hall was identified by the Properties Task Force as suitable for sale of a 99-year lease that would ensure that the property remains in Trust ownership. A conservation management plan to protect and enhance its heritage value was revised. =Moran family ownership= The property was put on the real estate market in 2012 and sold for $4.551m to the Moran family.Blok, in SMH, 2012 The family plan to restore it and propose it will be the home of the Moran prizes, sponsored and administered by the Moran Arts Foundation Ltd. Additionally the original four rooms on the ground floor will be used for portrait and photographic exhibitions, with access by the general public on most days of the year. The first floor and attics are proposed to be converted into a private residence for family members.NTA (NSW) website e-news, accessed 12 October 2012 The family have a long history of restoring historic properties, including Redleaf in Wahroonga, Blandford in Leura, Swifts in Darling Point, Studley Park in Camden and Moran House in Bridge Street, Sydney. The Morans are direct descendants of Robert and Sarah Cooper, through the matriarch Greta Moran, to the original builders and owners of Juniper Hall. Consequently, the Moran family has a genuine concern for the conservation of Juniper Hall to restore it to its former magnificence. 'The Moran family is delighted to be in a position to continue its involvement with the ongoing preservation and conversation of some of Australia's most iconic properties', said Peter Moran.NTA (NSW) website e-news, accessed 12 October 2012. The Moran family have restored the ground level as an exhibition space.Moran, Peter, Wentworth Courier, 18 December 2013.

Description =Siting The position of Juniper Hall on top of the Oxford Street ridge line means it has wide views across Sydney Harbour to the north and to Botany Bay to the south. Juniper Hall garden During the later 1980s the row of shops facing Oxford Street were demolished and Juniper Hall and its front garden were restored and reinstated (respectively). The National Trust of Australia (NSW) determined that its Garden Committee under the leadership of Annie Ross, were ideally placed to reinstate the garden. Its members worked tirelessly to raise over $100,000 to finance the cost of this project. The perimeter fence was rebuilt, using iron pickets instead of the earlier corrugated iron capped fence - this was a political decision to enable greater views into the preorperty and encourage potential purchase of the front garden by Woollahra Municipal Council for use as public open space (this latter hope did not eventuate).

This was substituted with a bull bay/southern/evergreen magnolia (M.grandiflora), which has a similar dark, large leaf and the advantange of large white scented flowers. Similarly yuccas (Spanish bayonets/Adam's needle) were thought unwise in grounds expected to be used and accessed by large numbers of people. These were substituted for Kaffir lilies (Clivia sp.). The front grounds were divided in two (in accordance with photographic evidence) by a painted picket fence, as they were when the prorperty was a children's refuge.

Where evidence indicated, the original species was reinstated in the same place (e.g. a pair of Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla) as feature trees beside the main path on the lawn, Kaffir lilies and agapanthus clumps either side of the central paths. A buffalo grass lawn was laid between central and perimeter garden beds. The perimeter garden beds were planted with flowering shrubs such as oleanders, Cape plumbago (P.capensis), sky flower (Duranta repens), Indian hawthorn (Raphiolepis sp.), gardenias, jasmine, mock orange (Choisya ternata) and Abelia, well as a flower border containing old-fashioned annuals of the period. A hedge of cypresses was later added along the Ormond Street fence to screen this side of the garden and enclose the space. The former superintendent's garden on the eastern side was recreated with the roundel reinstated in its centre. Paths led from the presumed front gate, around this circular bed, to end at the residence's front door. The rounded bed was edged with English box (Buxus sempervirens) and filled with ubiquitous periwinkle (Vinca major) as indicated in photographs. Within it were planted several shrubs, typical of the era such as lavender, Camellia japonica cv., sweet box (Murraya paniculata), Port wine magnolia (Michelia figo), oleander (Nerium oleander cv.), Cape plumbago, Rothmannia amoena and yesterday-today and tomorrow (Brunfelsia sp.). A large bank of Hydrangea macrophylla was planted along the front verandahs and a mixed shrubbery of Cape plumbago, jasmine and shell ginger plants were planted to screen the eastern boundary. A more recent perimeter plantings are an Illawarra plum / plum or brown pine (Podocarpus elatus) and a Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum). Also growing here are some roses, oleander, a Southern/evergreen magnolia/bull bay tree, sweet box and a Himalayan yellow jasmine (Jasminium mesnyi), the latter both on the eastern boundary and a bush along Oxford Street east of the main entry path.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 1/2014 Maintenance of the garden was taken over by the Juniper Hall Committee, formed in 1989.

Some of the fencing shown in early photographs that kept the children out of both gardens has not yet been reinstated. House A substantial two-storey Georgian house. It is typical of its period, lacking the elegance of John Verge's design, but following the fashion of its day, in that it has a double front door in the centre flanked by two large windows on each side. The front door and windows are unaltered and the window shutters are still in position. The front door has a fanlight in the simple Georgian position. Cedar bannisters are of simple, pleasing design, leading right up to the attic floor. Much of the original woodwork has been painted. The house is built on a sandstone ridge, and has an extensive cellar and kitchen below. The original house remains clear of later Victorian extensions sympathetic to the original design. (Heritage Office notes). Built to his design, it had 8 rooms, a water closet, large cellar, veranda and balcony in addition to stables, kitchen, laundry and servant's quarters. It features a double front door in the centre flanked by two large windows on each side. The fanlight above the door is of grand proportions and the fluted columns an elegant reminder of the Georgian style so favoured by early colonists. Walls are of simple stuccoed brick standing on a base of local sandstone. Small-paned windows are flanked by shtters and the simple but elegant portico remains.  Condition  As at 28 February 2000, the physical condition is good. The building is substantially intact.Clive Lucas & Partners 1985  Modifications and dates  The following modifications were made to Juniper Hall: * estate granted (in joint title) * house completed *1830s \\"fashionable improvements\\" to house *1852-8 Children's home and court established *1921 erection of a row of six shops along Oxford Street boundary, destroying front garden. Conversion into flats *1980s demolition of row of shops from 1920s *1987-8 garden and grounds reinstated using early photographs, records and research. Restoration of the house for diverse (since) uses: antique shop, offices, residence above.  Heritage listing  As at 14 October 2010, Juniper Hall is an early house (-5) on a substantial scale made rare among surviving residences for having been built by an emancipist (Robert Cooper). Most of the fabric including joinery has survived substantially intact from the first half of the century and demonstrates the impact the new fashions of the 1830s had on earlier houses as well as contemporary domestic economy. It has been an early focal point in Paddington and has considerable townscape significance. On several occasions since 1921 local esteem has been a factor in preventing its demolition and redevelopment. Juniper Hall, Paddington was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Juniper Hall is an early colonial house (-1826), on a substantial scale, and is the earliest extant domestic building east of the city. It is probably Australia's oldest surviving suburban villa (i.e. residence \\"in the round,\\" with at least two fronts and basement offices). It is a major physical manifestation of the life and aspirations of Robert Cooper. The building had an institutional role for a significant period, and has important associations with the history and development of child welfare facilities in Sydney. It has important associations with the Attorney general, John Kinchela. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. most of the fabric, including joinery has survived substantially intact from the first half of the nineteenth century, and demonstrates the impact the new fashions of the mid 1840s had on earlier houses. It retains its suburban site since the subdivision of 1877. It is a geographical landmark, and a focal point in the Paddington townscape, which predates the subdivision of the suburb for terrace houses. Together with the nearby Town Hall and Post office, Juniper Ha;; forms an important suburban civic precinct. Additions made to the building in the late nineteenth century respect the original house. These additions are substantial, sympathetic and intact. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has achieved social significance in the twentieth century, when local esteem has been an important factor in preventing its demolition and redevelopment. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It contains interiors with interpretation potential to display aspects of the history of the building and its occupants. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is rare among surviving residences of the period, having been built by an emancipist.

It lives in the Arctic and other cold, deep waters, swimming independently in mid-ocean.Siphonophores Retrieved 2011-10-01. It is a colonial creature that is born from a single egg which is fertilized. Later on, a protozoan form that eventually grows to form more duplicating members of the colony. Description Like other siphonophores, Marrus orthocanna is a colony composed of a number of specialised zooids linked together by a long stem. At the front is the pneumatophore, an orange-coloured, gas-filled float. Behind this is the nectosome, a region where there are a number of translucent nectophores with red, unlooped radial canals. These are bell-shaped medusae specialised for locomotion. When they contract, water is expelled which causes the colony to move. Their contractions are coordinated which enables the animal to swim forwards, sidewards or backwards. The remaining region is the siphosome. Most of the zooids here are polyps, specialised for collecting food. They do this for the whole colony, spreading their single long tentacles in the water to snare prey. Other zooids in this region undertake digestion and assimilation of food items. Reproductive medusae are found among the polyps in the siphosome and also various other specialised zooids. The various forms are all arranged in a repeating pattern.Marrus orthocanna - Kramp, 1942 Arctic Ocean Diversity. Retrieved 2011-10-01.The main foods of this organism are decapods, krill and other smaller crustaceans. Distribution and habitat Marrus orthocanna occurs pelagically in the mesopelagic zone of the Arctic Ocean, the north west Pacific Ocean, the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the north Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is found at depths ranging between . The greatest depth at which it has been observed is about . At these depths the temperature is about , hardly any light penetrates from the surface and human observation is limited to what can be seen from submersible craft.Bathyal zone Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 2011-10-02. Biology Marrus orthocanna can be several metres long and the tentacles can extend fifty centimetres on either side. It moves forward intermittently before pausing to put out its \\"fishing lines\\", ready to ensnare passing creatures. It is a carnivore whose diet is thought to consist mainly of small crustaceans such as decapods, krill, copepods and mysids. This colonial animal arises from a single fertilised egg. The protozooid that develops from this subsequently buds to form the other members of the colony which are thus genetically identical. The protozooid first thins and elongates, the middle section becoming the stem of the colony. The pneumatophore forms at the opposite end to the mouth. Next a growth zone on the thin stem forms and budding occurs with the formation of the nectophores. As the stem continues lengthening, further zooids develop above these. Another growth zone sees the development of the siphosome and the continuing elongation of the stem carries these zooids down with it. The division of labor among the zooids is an evolutionary advance in the constant struggle for existence in the deep sea. Such organisms as Marrus orthocanna blur the boundaries between the individual polyp and the whole colonial organism; each cannot exist without the other.

Completed in the Federation Queen Anne style, the house was listed on the Ku-ring-gai Council local government heritage register in 2015 and is in a heritage conservation area.  History  Berith Park was designed by Francis Ernest Stowe for Alfred Smith, who came from Queensland. Smith acquired the land in 1897 and the house was finished around 1909. By 1914 the house was in the hands of Sir Arthur Rickard, the founder of the Dr Barnardos charity for children. Rickard made substantial changes to the house, putting in tennis courts, a swimming pool, a ballroom, an ornamental lake, cricket oval and gardens. The house was later bought by Alderman Stanley Crick, the Lord Mayor of Sydney and a founder of Fox Studios. Berith Park was used extensively as a location in a number of films. Crick later started selling off parts of the property. The Catholic Church bought the house in 1955 for use as a home for the Dominican Fathers and then Dominican Sisters. It was sold again in 1979 and extensive changes were made. In 2004 more subdivisions were made and an acre of the land was sold off. Vivian and Wendy King purchased the house in 1990 for $5 million from retired bookmaker Bruce McHugh. The Kings sold the house in 2002 for $5.59 million. In December 2016 the house was sold by Warwick and Karen White to corporate lawyer Karthika Gunalingam for more than $11 million.

It was designed by John F. Hilly and built from 1830 to 1858 by William Wentworth. It is also known as Carrara; Strickland Convalescent Home for Women; Strickland House Hospital for the Aged. The property is owned by the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 and on 21 March 1978 was listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.  History  Strickland House's site has been identified as having twelve phases of historical development from the pre-European occupation of the site; to the first grants made to William Wentworth, who gifted this part of his estate to his daughter, Thomasina, and her husband, Thomas Fisher, in the 1830s-55 (they did not build on it, returning to England); to Charles Lowe, who may have started building the house, but then on-sold the site; to John Hosking, Sydney's second mayor (who owned it 1855-76) who built Carrara and lived here; to Henry Moore and his family (1876‚Äì88); to Arthur Wigram Allen, tenants and caretakers (1888-1899); Tudor House (1899-1902); to other members of the Allen family (1902‚Äì14); and then through a period of ownership and use by the NSW Government / Minister for Lands (1914‚Äì15) who bought the site with funds from the Foreshores Resumption Scheme for use as a 'public recreation ground'; for subsequent re-purpose as the Strickland Convalescent Home for Women (1915‚Äì33); and then as a Convalescent Hospital for Men and Women (1933‚Äì60); and as the Strickland House Hospital for the Aged (1960‚Äì90); and finally in its current phase of ownership and use since 1990. The site demonstrates an important component of the early settlement patterns in the district, being part of an early land grant (originally made to William Charles Wentworth) that has not been subdivided. The site has associations with the historical figures of William Charles Wentworth, the original owner of the (originally much larger) property; John Hosking, who built Carrara and substantially developed the grounds; and subsequent occupants including Henry Moore and members of the Allen family are of significance. The status of these people as leading political figures in the nineteenth century ensured that Carrara was well known within important social circles in Sydney at that time. John Hosking development and ownership John Hosking 1860 The original villa, Carrara was built in 1856 in a large landscaped setting, including a strong relationship between the house and the water. The two-storey segmental bay projection is striking and represents a relatively early use of such a feature. The remnants of the sandstone wharf adjacent to Milk Beach contributes to the strength of this association. John Hosking (1806-1882), the Mayor of Sydney, commissioned John Frederick Hilly in 1856 to build Strickland House (then called Carrara). An advertisement was placed in The Sydney Morning Herald on 15 April 1856 for contractors to erect the walls of the house. Hosking was born in 1806 in England. His father was the Principal of a day school and was invited in 1809 to come to Sydney to run the Female Orphan School in George Street. He returned to London ten years later when John was 13 years old. When John was 20 he decided to return to Australia with his brother and opened a store in Pitt Street. He went into business with John Terry Hughes who was the nephew of Samuel Terry, an extremely wealthy merchant and landowner. In 1829 he married Terry's daughter, Martha, and the couple had three daughters. The family lived at Strickland House until 1876 and then moved to Penrith to live with one of their daughters. An advertisement was placed in the newspapers in 1877 which described in detail the house and surrounding gardens of the property. Some of the description is as follows. Henry Moore ownership Elizabeth and Henry Moore, . Henry Moore (1815-1888) moved into Strickland House in 1879 with his wife, Elizabeth, and seven of his adult children. He was born in London in 1815 and came to Australia as a child with his father, Captain Joseph Moore, who became a merchant. After leaving school he entered his father's firm which was a large importing company. In 1839 he married Elizabeth Scholes Johnson and the couple had nine children ‚Äì three sons and six daughters. He bought a large wharf at Darling Harbour which was later called Moore's Wharf. He was also an agent for the P & O shipping line. In 1868 he became a Member of the NSW Parliament and retained this position for almost 20 years. An account of life at Strickland House and the Moore family in the 1880s was given by one of the housemaids when, in later years, she wrote of her life at the house: From July 1879 to June 1888 the Hon. Henry Moore MLC lived at Carrara. He had extensive business in loading and discharging of vessels. About 1840 he bought Moore's Wharf at Millers Point and from 1852-80 was the first P. & O. shipping agent in Sydney, becoming an MLA in 1868. He married Elizabeth Johnston in 1839 and over 20 years they had 12 children. They moved into Carrara in July 1869 from Barncleuth (later Kinnell), Darlinghurst as that suburb was getting too crowded. Some four years later Moore became owner of Carrara. Their youngest son, Verner, described the Carrara years as \\"halcyon\\". They would be invited on board ships anchored in the bay and would return the hospitality. He considered Carrara had a ghost in the giant bamboo, which would crash about in the wind. Mrs Moore died aged 66 in 1885 and in 1888 Henry died, aged 73. After 1888 the family split up, some going to England, some interstate. Ownership under Arthur Allen and Boyce Allen Arthur and Boyce Allen, 1900. When Henry Moore died, the property was purchased by Arthur Wigram Allen, in conjunction with his eldest brother, Boyce, on 11 December 1888. Arthur, well-known solicitor and Sydney identity, was married to Ethel, daughter of Watler Lamb who built the original Kambala on Bellevue Hill. Arthur was third of six sons of Sir George Wigram Allen, whose father George founded the well known epoymous legal firm, Allens, and built Toxteth Park estate at Glebe. Arthur's youngest brother Walter was father of Oswald, known in the cricketing world as \\"Gubby Allen\\". He may have used Carrara's grounds and hall as a cricket pitch. Gubby Allen was the English test bowler in the famous \\"bodyline\\" series, lived at Carrara as a boy. Boyce Allen lived in the house with his family for over ten years. Boyce Allen (1856-1945) was born in Glebe in 1856. His father was George Wigram Allen, a prominent solicitor and politician who owned Toxteth Park, Glebe, which is now St Scholastica's College. He was one of eleven children, six boys and five girls. His brother Arthur Wigram Allen was also a solicitor and they went into partnership in a legal firm. Arthur was a very enthusiastic photographer and many of his photos depicting scenes of Sydney are still used in exhibitions. Afternoon tea at Strickland House, 1898. In 1888 Boyce married Isabella Dundas who was the daughter of Joseph Dundas a Scottish landowner who lived in Carron Hall in Stirlingshire. She came to Sydney to visit her relative Admiral Henry Fairfax who at that time was living at Admiralty House. It was during this short visit that she met Boyce Allen and shortly after they married. The couple moved to Strickland House immediately after their wedding. They had six children three boys and three girls. A niece of Boyce Allen described the family and the house in her memoirs: During the Allen period of ownership, the Sands Directories for the following years list the occupants as:Poland, 1992 *1889 - Bennett, gardener; *1890-92 - Johanthon Seavers, CBP, MLA; *1893-96 - George Boyce Allen (Arthur's brother); *1897-98 - Dewley, gardener; *1899 - Mr Lyons; *1900-03 - Wilfred Inman, Boys Preparatory School (which moved to Moss Vale and became Tudor House); *1904 - George Boyce Allen; *1905-11 - Mrs J. P. Garvan. =Wilfred Inman, as a tenant= Wilfred and Mary Inman with student at Strickland House, 1899. Between 1899 and 1902 the house was let to Wilfred Alexander Inman who used the house as a school which later became Tudor House School, Moss Vale. Wilfred Alexander Inman (1862-1950) was born at Spital Old Hall in Bebington, Cheshire in 1862. His father was Charles Inman, a wealthy merchant and his mother was Decima Isabella Catherine Davies. In 1882 at the age of 19 he immigrated to Melbourne on the ship Sobraon.Inward Overseas Passenger Lists (British Ports) Some years later he found employment at Groongal Station on the Murrumbidgee River. In 1897 he married Mary Martin, the daughter of Sir James Martin, Chief Justice of NSW, and Lady Isabella Martin. During her childhood Mary had lived at nearby Greycliffe House and later at Woollahra House. In the same year as their marriage the Inmans started a school at Erewal in Bellevue Hill called the ‚ÄúPreparatory School for Boys‚Äù. This school was moved two years later to Strickland House. In later years Wilfred Inman wrote about his time at the house, commenting:Tudor House Preparatory School website. Online reference In 1915 the Allen family sold Strickland House to the Government to become a hospital. Use as a hospital The siting and general design of the Strickland House site represents the picturesque aspirations of wealthy mid nineteenth century society. The garden and grounds of Strickland house are significant for their siting and development, largely credited to the Hosking period of ownership, according to romantic picturesque principles. The landscape of the Strickland House site is significant as a scale of grounds associated with a former harbour side \\"marine\\" villa residence adapted to institutional use and now open space with integral physical and visual connections with Sydney Harbour and adjacent Sydney Harbour National Park lands. The development of Strickland House's garden can be divided into two historical phases:Tanner Architects, 2003. # as the garden setting for a grand private residence, a Victorian marine villa on the shores of Sydney Harbour; # as the grounds of a convalescent home (-1989). The Stables building is a substantial outbuilding representing an extension of the facilities required to support a substantial family residence and property during the mid nineteenth century. Architecturally it exhibits idiosyncratic detailing that has an unfinished quality and makes this building rare. The relationship of the Stables to Carrara combined with its unusual details contribute to the aesthetic quality of the site and setting as a whole. In 1911 the NSW government established the Foreshores Resumption Scheme. Purchases made by the NSW government in 1912 and 1914 were significant factors that contributed to the site's preservation. The property was purchased in June 1914 with funds from the Foreshore Resumption Scheme - the same scheme that paid for the adjacent Nielsen Park - \\"for a public recreation ground at Rose Bay\\" and \\"to be added to Nielsen Park\\".Woollahra Council; Woollahra History & Heritage Society, 2014. This was to satisfy public demand of the day for land on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour for public use in perpetuity. The site was subsequently adapted to provide a public health care facility - a significant phase in the development of the site representing changing government attitudes in health care ideology in NSW. It reopened in 1915 as the Strickland House Convalescent Hospital for Women. The additional buildings (two large dormitories for men and women) constructed during the 1933 demonstrate the importance of the health care facility to the community and are a physical representation of occupation by the Department of Health. When the Women's Convalescent facility was opened in 1915 it was named \\"The Strickland Convalescent Home for Women\\" after the then NSW Governor, Sir Gerald Strickland. Greycliffe House in Nielsen Park had been named after its acquisition \\"The Lady Edeline Hospital for Mothers and Babies\\" after this Governor's wife. Strickland House was still being used for respite care and long-term care after 1960, in addition to housing aged patients.Woollahra History & Heritage Society, 2012. The convalescence and subsequently aged care facility operated on the site for seventy five continuous years, exceeding the period of residential use for the site. In 1960 it was used for both respite and long-term care. The NSW Department of Health ran the facility as a nursing home from 1915 to 1989.ST, 19 September 2010. The hospital was closed in December 1989. A plan for 45 per cent of the land to be leased for 99 years and an additional 25 per cent to be leased separately was abandoned due to public backlash. Subsequent use Debate has continued over the best use of the grounds since the hospital closed in 1989. Woollahra History & Heritage Society (WHHS) president, Peter Poland, and his (late) wife, June, campaigned to preserve Strickland House and its grounds in community use for more than 22 years. The grounds constitute one of the finest public harbour side parks in Sydney, affording extensive and unparalleled views of Sydney Harbour. The landscape setting, and particularly the borrowed landscape of the Sydney Harbour National Park lands, including wharf remnants and the waters of Sydney Harbour, are integral to the property and its interpretation as a significant cultural landscape within the visual and spatial structure of Sydney Harbour. The setting that has been maintained is important as a historical scheme and to the contemporary community who widely appreciate it for its recreational value. In 1992 the National Trust (NSW) arranged two Open Days attracting over 1400 people. The WHHS held a stall at this and published a booklet by June Poland \\"Carrara/Strickland House, the Finest Site on the Foreshores of Sydney Harbour\\". 1153 copies of this booklet have been sold at various public open days held by this society since 1998 and many before that date. A supplementary section to this booklet listing events relating to the site from 1992 to 2011 was added in that year. There were vigorous community protests against the Greiner Government selling off or leasing of parts of the grounds. = Administration under the Greiner and Fahey governments = A Strickland House Advisory Committee was established by then Planning Minister, Robert Webster, in January 1993 to call for, examine and recommend proposals for the property's future. Peter Debnam MP, after election as the Member for Vaucluse, established a Strickland House Review Group which developed \\"guiding principles\\" for the property. These included preserving the site's cultural heritage values and open space, while providing a framework for consistent decision-making in short and long-terms. They also included retaining public ownership and appropriate general public use and enjoyment. The Strickland House Advisory Committee suggested the buildings be made into strata units and a boutique hotel in 1993. This was strongly opposed and never came to fruition. The current appreciation of the site is reflected in the site being declared an urban park (under the then Urban Parks Authority) by then Premier John Fahey in 1994. However, this was not gazetted. The public has had access to the grounds since 1994. A fence erected in the 1980s between the house grounds and Hermitage Foreshore Reserve (part of Sydney Harbour National Park) was removed in 1994. = Administration under the Carr, Iemma, Rees, and Keneally governments = After the 1995 election of the Carr government, the Urban Parks Authority was abolished and responsibility for Strickland House passed to the Minister for Public Works and Services.Poland, 2011. The Carr NSW government proposal in 1997 for a world-class boutique hotel met with strong community protests (1348 letters and 3474 petition signatures against it meant the plan was voted down) (as did Woollahra Municipal Council's draft LEP and DCP rezoning the site) and the proposal and rezoning were not adopted. Premier Carr in August 1997 launched the Government's \\"Vision for Sydney Harbour\\", which included maximum public access to and use of foreshore land, and protection of all items of heritage significance. It also included an intention to use State Planning powers to block development of Federal Defence harbourside land. In 1998 Woollahra Municipal Council held community workshops to develop draft land use, conservation and development principles for the property, endorsing these and referring them to the NSW Department of Public Works and Services for comment. In 1999 Strickland House (and then 55% of its estate) was entered on the NSW State Heritage Register. In 2000 the WHHS made a submission to the Heritage Council seeking extension of its SHR curtilage to include the whole estate. Woollahra Municipal Council adopted the land use, conservation and development principles for the property. At an annual open day in 2002 the WHHS noted a record attendance and people from over 150 Sydney suburbs and many places elsewhere, who signed a petition and letters to then Premier Carr. In 2003 a revised conservation management plan's preparation was announced by The Hon. John Della Bosca MLC, Minister for Commerce. At an annual open day in 2004 a new record of people from over 162 suburbs of Sydney and other places visited the site and signed petition and letters to Premier Carr seeking retention in public ownership, no sale or long-term lease and control on development, subdivision and refurbishment of the house. The Strickland House site was transferred from NSW Treasury ownership to the State Property Authority on 1 September 2006. Conservation works to the exterior of the house have since been undertaken, including removal of the fire escape stairs and glass verandah infill on the west and south facades. Deteriorated corrugated iron sheet roofing of service wings was replaced and the building repainted. Ground floor interiors of the house have been largely restored. In 2009 the State Property Authority was transferred into a new Super Ministry for Services and Administration under then Premier Rees. In 2010 the conservation management plan was being updated and a Concept Use Plan was in development to guide potential development on the property. The Occupational Therapy Block and covered way linking South Dormitory, Occupational Therapy Block and rear service wings were removed between 2009 and 2011. In 2011 the sandstone retaining wall along Vaucluse Road was repointed, a render capping applied and the boundary fence replaced. In 2011 the WHHS sought the support of an incoming O'Farrell government to rezone the property to fulfil the intention of the State Government's promise in 1914 - \\"for a public recreation ground at Rose Bay\\". = Administration under the O'Farrell, Baird, and Berejiklian governments = The State Planning Authority sought private sector interest in rezoning parts of the site for residential or commercial use, including options of low-density housing, small business spaces and a function centre. The draft conservation management plan for the site proposes changes to its zoning.Hagias, 2012. At an August 2012 Community Cabinet meeting, the Society requested Minister for Heritage, Robyn Parker consider gazetting the Strickland House land as a Public Park. The Society has been advised that the Office of Environment & Heritage does not have the authority to do this.Woollahra History & Heritage Society, 2013, 1-2. An on-site caretaker is employed to maintain the site and coordinate various fund-raising activities. In October 2012, Woollahra Council, following discussions with the State Property Authority, now called Government Property NSW (GPN) considered the appropriate zoning for the Strickland House site. GPN submitted consultant's advice that the appropriate zone was either R2 low density residential or SP2 infrastructure (the Society understands this to be commercial). Woollahra Council staff opposed this and recommended that RE1 Public Recreation was the appropriate zoning. The Society, National Trust (NSW), the Rose Bay Residents Association and others supported the staff recommendation which, in due course, was adopted by Woollahra Council. The GPN proposal led to some speculation that the Government was intending to sell off part of the estate. This was denied by Finance Minister Greg Pearce, and local MP, Gabrielle Upton. The remainder of the site was listed on the NSW State Heritage Register in 2012. The site has been open to the public annually on 4 May since 1996. This coincides with the National Trust of Australia (NSW) Heritage Festival. In April 2013 the Public Works Department, working for Government Property NSW, commenced work on both the Stables and former Gardener's Cottage near the main gateway. Extensive work was done to the Stables including a new tiled roof with skylights, extensive stonework restoration and all woodwork has been repaired and painted. Works to the Gardener's Cottage were also completed. Both buildings contained asbestos. The two dormitory blocks and former Nurses' Quarters were fenced off. Their external paint contained lead and was to be stripped off. Security for the property has been managed by a private contractor since September 2014. Government Property NSW approved a proposal to install a seat at the site in memory of June Poland, who played a key part in the campaign to save Strickland House over the years and wrote the booklet on the property's history.Woollahra History & Heritage Society news, October 2014. On an open day on 3 May 2015 Gabrielle Upton MP unveiled a special memorial seat honouring the life and contribution to heritage of June Poland (1935-2013).Woollahra History & Heritage Society, April 2015.  Use in popular culture  The house exteriors and surrounding garden and beach were used for the fictional Koolunga School which was the sister school of Eastland in The Facts of Life Down Under. In 2007 the grounds and house of Strickland House were used by Baz Luhrmann in filming parts of his movie \\"Australia\\", doubling as Government House, Darwin. It has also been used for film and TV shoots for Underbelly, The Apprentice and The Farmer Wants a WifeCrosson, 2013. as well as for The Krait. A TV series called Flat Chat made an episode of the UK series The Minder.Poland, Peter (2013). Personal correspondence.  Description =Estate and grounds The Strickland House site comprises harbourside land near Neilson Park in Vaucluse. The land parcel closely reflects the original subdivision from the land grant made to William Wentworth in the 1830s. It contains buildings landscaping and other structures relating to the history of the site from Aboriginal ownership through its colonial history as a grand maritime estate to its 20th century use as a convalescent home and later aged care facility. The landscape setting of Carrara and the later hospital buildings contain a number of elements including the looped carriage entrance, pathways, stone edged garden beds terraces lawns, a croquet court, a landscaped creek and pond and a sandstone quarry. There are mature plantings many of which date from the healthcare facility phase of the sites history and a number from earlier phases of its development. The forested backdrop of scattered native trees on the high land to the east of the site is thought to be an intended original \\"picturesque\\" feature of the landscaping and is still retained. A number of pedestrian paths lace the property, some following the slopes in gentle falls, some marked by steps to manage steeper sections. Most have been surfaced with concrete in the twentieth century and the main driveway has been paved with bitumen and patched at various intervals, although it retains its early configuration and form, approaching the mansion indirectly to give a series of views on approach, deliberately manipulating the visitor's view.Read, Stuart (October 2010). Personal communications. In 1994 Premier John Fahey declared all the grounds an Urban Park. In January 2012 the NSW Government gazetted that the NSW State Heritage Register listing for Strickland House had been extended to cover the entire property. Currently the grounds are open to the public during daylight hours seven days a week. The house is used for films, advertising etc., but is open to the public one day a year during the National Trust's Heritage Festival. It can be seen from the track along Hermitage Reserve, which is part of the Sydney Harbour National Park. Garden A number of mature trees and shrub plantings dominate and give character to densely planted boundaries, internal terraces, shrubberies and borders bounding the curving driveway to the mansion, its framed views west to the harbour, lower slopes around the croquet green, borders around the Service area, Stables, Dormitory buildings, etc. Some of these trees have significance in their own right, reflecting the tastes, contacts and reach of empire of the mid-late 19th century. These include Himalayan chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) - of which there are a few specimens, some 18 m tall (1989, more so now), stone pines from the Mediterranean (Pinus pinea) with characteristic flat crowns and pine nuts, New South Wales and Queensland rainforest species such as hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), a giant bamboo (Bambusa balcooa), various Chinese hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), a camphor laurel (Cinnamommum camphora), Port Jackson or rusty fig (Ficus rubiginosa), African olives (Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata) (probably former hedge species), a large mature bull bay or evergreen magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) from the Southern US (over 3 stories tall in 1989, more so now), a large mature tuckeroo (Cupaniopsis anacardioides) a locally native coastal species, Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis), Camellia japonica, and Indian hawthorn (Raphiolepis sp.). Also on site is a rather uncommon (in NSW) tipu tree from Bolivia, (Tipuana tipu), and an unusual locally native small tree, Monotoca elliptica, 2 m tall.WHHS, 1989; Stuart Read, notes from a visit, 10/2010 Mansion Strickland House is a Victorian Italianate mansion virtually intact and consists of three storeys of sandstone, which was unusually painted, and features verandahs with Doric columns. Set close to the harbour foreshore, it has extensive views across the water. The original mansion, Carrara, remains essentially intact and located to capture 180 degree views to the harbour. The two storey residence is constructed of dressed sandstone stone walls with painted finishes. There is an attic storey made of timber. While the building is planned on a rectangle the colonaded verandahs on two sides, including a two-storey semicircular projection on the west facade and the stone portico/iron balcony (first floor)on the north side are asymmetrically arranged. The verandahs on the west and south elevations feature a colonnade of doric columns. The downstairs rooms of the formal part of the house are arranged around a central hallway . To the west are the formal reception rooms which feature cedar framed french doors allowing views of the harbour from these rooms. Various rooms lie on the eastern side. All these rooms retain their cedar and plaster details with some modifications to the cedar skirtings. Beneath the dining room there is a large cellar. The first floor originally contains bedrooms and bathrooms and these were later converted to wards and offices. Service area The service area containing servants quarters, kitchen and laundry is located to the east on the east of the house and are arranged around a courtyard which has been infilled with partitions and ramps during the building's use as a health care facility. Coach house To the east of Carrara lies a stables and coach house dating from the original phase of construction in. The L shaped building is constructed of dressed sandstone with gabled rooves. Multi-paned timber windows are arranged across each elevation and retain sandstone sills except where there have been modifications. Internally the building retains its original layout and also it sandstone flag floors. Dormitory building To the north west of Carrara is a large masonry hospital dormitory building constructed in the 1930s in the Georgian Revival style. Another similarly styled dormitory building lies to the south of Carrara. On higher land to the north east of Carrara lies a third building constructed in the neo Georgian style in the 1930s. This was the nurses home for the convalescent hospital.  Condition  As at 23 December 2008, the site's intact nature makes it a valuable technical and research resource. The analysis and interpretation of archaeological remains form this site may provide evidence of the material culture of the various occupants of the site as well as contributing to the understanding of the design and development of gardens in mid-nineteenth century Sydney. Beyond the quarry and the site of the former Porter's Lodge, the archaeological potential of the site and its specific nature are unknown, however any evidence may contribute knowledge into substantive research questions.  Modifications and dates  2010: demolition of 1960s/70s buildings 3 and 4 (dining room), covered way and former occupational therapy block to the rear of the house.  Heritage listing  As at 16 February 2004, The Strickland House site on Sydney Harbour, Vaucluse, is of exceptional historical significance as a remarkably intact 1850s villa with a largely unaltered landscape setting. The site demonstrates an important component of the early settlement patterns in the district, being part of an early land grant (originally made to William Charles Wentworth) that has not been subdivided. The original building Carrara is an exceptional example of an early Victorian Italianate style marine mansion designed for a picturesque setting. This is one of the better known domestic works of the nineteenth century architectural firm of Hilly and Mansfield, the design largely attributed to John F. Hilly. \\"As part of a wider network of mansions including Vaucluse House and Greycliffe House it helps to demonstrate and explain the formative influences, social status and desirable qualities of this part of Sydney during the nineteenth century\\". The intact nature of the original residence and its landscape setting, including the strong relationship that remains between the house and the water, are rare in the context of metropolitan Sydney. The remnants of the sandstone wharf adjacent to Milk Beach contributes to the strength of this association. The siting and general design of the Strickland House site represents the picturesque aspirations of wealthy mid nineteenth century society. The house continues to display the landmark qualities that were important to the historical scheme, and the layout and relationship of various elements demonstrate class distinctions and hierarchical relationships that existed in the mid nineteenth century. Carrara is of exceptional aesthetic significance, being of high architectural merit and containing many original features. The intactness of both internal and external details dating back to the 1850s enhances the significance of the property as an example of early Victorian workmanship and taste. The two-storey segmental bay projection is striking and represents a relatively early use of such a feature. The Stables building is a noteworthy example of a substantial outbuilding, representing an extension of the facilities required to support a substantial family residence and property during the mid nineteenth century. Architecturally, the Stables exhibits idiosyncratic detailing that has an unfinished quality and makes this building a rare example of its kind. The relationship of the Stables to Carrara combined with its unusual details contribute to the aesthetic quality of the site and setting as a whole. The site's associations with the historical figures of William Charles Wentworth, the original owner of the property, John Hosking, who substantially developed the grounds of Carrara, and subsequent occupants including Henry Moore and members of the Allen family are also of significance. The status of these people as leading political figures in the nineteenth century ensured that Carrara was well known within important social circles in Sydney at that time. The Strickland House site maintains its exceptional social significance today, in particular within the local area, and displays landmark qualities that can be appreciated from a wide surrounding area. Purchases made by the NSW government in 1912 and 1914 were significant factors that have contributed to the preservation of the site. The subsequent adaptation of the site to provide a public health care facility marks a significant phase in the development of the Strickland House site and represents changing government attitudes in health care ideology in NSW. The additional buildings constructed during the 1930s demonstrate the importance of the health care facility to the community and are a physical representation of occupation by the Department of Health. The convalescence and subsequently aged care facility operated on the site for seventy five continuous years, exceeding the period of residential use for the site. The garden and grounds of Strickland house are of cultural significance on a state level for their siting and development, largely credited to the Hosking period of ownership, according to romantic picturesque principles. The landscape of the Strickland House site is of exceptional cultural significance as a scale of grounds associated with a former harbourside \\"marine\\" villa residence adapted to institutional use and now open space with integral physical and visual connections with Sydney Harbour and adjacent Sydney Harbour National Park lands. Despite adaptation, the original qualities of the landscape may still be appreciated. The grounds of the Strickland House site constitute one of the finest public harbourside parks in Sydney, affording extensive and unparalleled views of Sydney Harbour. The landscape setting, and particularly the borrowed landscape of the Sydney Harbour National Park lands, including wharf remnants and the waters of Sydney Harbour, are integral to the property and its interpretation as a significant cultural landscape within the visual and spatial structure of Sydney Harbour. The setting that has been maintained is important as a historical scheme and to the contemporary community who widely appreciate it for its recreational value. The current appreciation of the site is reflected in the site being declared an urban park in 1994. The site's intact nature makes it a valuable technical and research resource. The analysis and interpretation of archaeological remains form this site may provide evidence of the material culture of the various occupants of the site as well as contributing to the understanding of the design and development of gardens in mid-nineteenth century Sydney. Beyond the quarry and the site of the former Porter's Lodge, the archaeological potential of the site and its specific nature are unknown, however any evidence may contribute knowledge into substantive research questions. The extended curtilage of this item reflects more closely the original subdivision of the land and ensures inclusion of the original landscape setting for the house as well as fabric relating to the site's precontact use by Aboriginal people and its later significant use as a convalescent hospital and aged care facility. Strickland House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. \\"The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\\" Carrara is part of a select group of houses owned and built by influential members of society in the mid nineteenth century. The Strickland House site is of considerable historic significance as it represents the picturesque aspirations of wealthy members of society during the second half of the nineteenth century, and how those aspirations were implemented in the Australian context. The intactness of Carrara and the landscape setting of the Estate contributes to an understanding of the cultural history of NSW. \\"The site is an important and largely intact component of the earliest settlement pattern of the district. It preserves an important component of an early land grant with particular associations for the Wentworth family through its excision as a marriage portion for their daughter Thomasine. In this, also, it demonstrates customs or habits no longer current in our society\\".Dawson Brown Architecture, 1997. \\"The relationship of the various components is particularly clear in demonstrating the relationships of the family and staff and, as such, is an optimal example of a particular class of mansions and the social hierarchies which operated in them. As part of a wider network of mansions including Vaucluse House and Greycliffe House it helps to demonstrate and explain the formative influences in this part of Sydney\\". \\"Carrara also was important as the site for the early beginnings of Tudor house, a famous private school at Moss Vale [formerly] associated with the Kings School. Carrara was home to this institution during the years 1899 - 1902. The use of a private house and staff and the arrangement of the school in this environment is particularly illuminating with respect to practices and philosophies of education for the affluent at the turn of the century\\". The Strickland House site is significant for seventy-five continuous years of health care commencing in 1915. The establishment of the convalescent hospital was the realisation of a NSW Labour Government initiative to reduce the pressures on metropolitan hospitals by providing trained supervision in an environment of less intense medical, nursing and technical services. \\"In its earliest years Strickland House was a particularly important service for women and especially new mothers. The adaptation of Greycliffe House at approximately the same time for the purposes of child health care marks an important step in an area of women's health care\\". The amalgamation of the Strickland House site of the convalescent facility for women with the men's facility, formerly from Denistone Hose, Eastwood, in the 1930s reflects further the changing attitudes within the broader health care system. The significance of the gardens and grounds of the Strickland House site derives from the following: *Its siting and development according to picturesque principles. The gardens and grounds of the site were prominent in their own time and the survival of the largely intact harbourside park and its relationship to Sydney Harbour is rare. *Its association with John Hosking, who developed the gardens at Strickland House during his period of ownership *Its association for seventy-five years with the Department of Health. The purchase of the site in 1914 by the NSW Government for harbourside parkland is a significant factor that has contributed to the preservation of the extensive parkland setting to Carrara. \\"The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.\\" The property has a strong historical connection with William Charles Wentworth, and explorer and social figure in New South Wales. W.C. Wentworth, an important member of society during the 1830s, was also granted several additional parcels of land at Rose Bay which contributed to making him one of the largest land holders in the area. The site is associated with several people of renown, in particular leading social and political figures of the nineteenth century. As well as the original owner W.C. Wentworth, the Strickland House site is associated with the following people: *The architect, John F Hilly who designed the house in the early 1850s *John Hosking, the first Mayor of the Council of the City of Sydney in 1842, who owned and developed the property between 1855 and 1876. Hosking's wife was the daughter of Samuel Terry, known as the 'Botany Bay Rothschild' *The Honourable Henry Moore of Sydney, a member of the Legislative Council and respected member of society, who purchased the block on which Carrara is sited in 1883. Moore occupied the property until his death in 1888. *Arthur Wigram Allen, whose family made a significant contribution to the development of Sydney. Arthur Allen, along with his brothers, was to become part of the famous legal firm of Allen, Allen & Helmsley. The firm was established by the Honourable George Allen, Arthur's grandfather in 1822 and is the longest running law firm in Australia, which for over 150 years had at least one member of the family as a board member. Carrara House is significant as an intact work of John F Hilly an architect of some fashionable villas for the wealthy in addition to commercial and ecclesiastical designs during the 1840s and 1850s. \\"The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\\" The house and setting of the Strickland House site are particularly significant as a picturesque Italianate composition. The picturesque ideal involved contrasting tamed expanses of open landscape with clusters of rough or \\"wild\\" outcrops of rocks or stands of trees. Strickland House was placed to take advantage of the ideal romantic site on Sydney Harbour with the vegetated area between the carriage drive and Vaucluse Road functioning as a backdrop. Both the setting and the house designed for it remain an exceptionally intact example of picturesque landscaping and design from the 1850s. These same aspects can be appreciated today despite the constraints of its setting. \\"The land, gardens, buildings and other works contained within Carrara/Strickland House demonstrate an evolving landscape of over one hundred and forty years, reflecting popular and personal tastes and fashions as well as institutional philosophies of patient care and wellbeing. The property is a particularly good example of the marine style mansions popular in this district and others which were designed to take advantage of the spectacular water views. The mixed planting of evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs together with the topographic variety, the vistas and views, the features such as walls, terraces and paths have produced a landscape with a strong design quality and character which is in stark contrast [to] the subdivided areas surrounding it. The later additions to the buildings and gardens have not substantially compromised these aspects\\". The open space leading towards Rose Bay and Sydney Harbour provides views that extend from Point Piper to Mosman and the city of Sydney. These views are integral to the landscaped scheme and are of considerable aesthetic importance. The open space is of importance not only as a historical scheme, but also for the contemporary community as the Strickland House site can be appreciated from many surrounding vantage points. As such the setting, including the borrowed landscape of the Sydney Harbour National Park, of Strickland House must be regarded as highly significant. The Strickland House site has landmark qualities as an exceptional space within the local landscape. The siting of Strickland House, the open landscape above Sydney Harbour and the vegetated backdrop against which these elements were sited combine to give the site landmark qualities. The Strickland House site remains as one of the finest public harbourside parks in Sydney and is arguably the grandest intact Italianate mansion in its landscape setting still extant in metropolitan Sydney. Carrara is an exceptional example of the work of architect John F Hilly, being of imposing scale and with a semi-circular two storey segmental bay projection. It seems Hilly was adept in the use of both the picturesque Gothic and the Italianate, as there are examples of his work in both of these styles. Aesthetically, the design of the house reflects the fashion for classically derived landscape architecture. The front curved projecting bay with Doric columns and extensive verandas complement the picturesque setting of the house. As a remarkably intact John F Hilly designed residence, Carrara is of exceptional aesthetic significance. Carrara is of high architectural quality both in its conception and in its decorative details. It contains many original features including marble chimneypieces imported from Italy in the 1850s and generally high quality cedar doors and joinery. Though there have been several unsympathetic additions to the house and various alterations to the interior (mostly to ceilings and kitchen/bathroom fitouts), these have not significantly altered the basic plan and have left most original decorative detail intact. There is good potential to restore the house to the distinguished character that it had during the 1850s and beyond as a grand residence of Sydney. The intactness of the house in both exterior and interior details makes it of extremely high significance as an example of early Victorian workmanship and taste in the 1850s. The idiosyncratic features of the Stables building, including projecting sandstone blocks, quoins at one corner only and gable end finished in brick masonry, have an eccentric aesthetic appeal. The significance of the gardens and grounds of the Strickland House site derives partly from the relationship between the house and the garden. Overall, as the setting for an important 1850s villa, it is of exceptional importance for its ability to demonstrate close adherence to mid nineteenth century design principles, for its surviving early fabric and for its mature plantings. The entire area to the south west of the Northern Dormitory (Block A) has been modified to form a large open space affording panoramic views over Sydney Harbour. The qualities of this open landscape are rare within Sydney Harbour. \\"The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\\" The association of Carrara with some leading social and political figures of the nineteenth century, combined with the exceptional nature of the Estate, ensured that \\"Carrara was particularly well known in the social life of nineteenth century Sydney\\". Schools generally have a strong level of social significance as community facilities. The site has some social significance for its use between 1899 and 1902 as a boys school, the forerunner to Tudor House now located at Moss Vale. The resumption of the foreshore land of several properties, including Carrara, by the Minister for Lands in 1912 as part of the establishment of a public reserve is a significant factor in the history of the site. These private properties along the Rose Bay foreshore were identified early as having the potential to provide public recreational space. The subsequent purchase of Carrara and its grounds by the NSW Government in 1914 \\"for a Public Recreation Ground at Rose Bay\\" recognises the importance of establishing such a community facility and is of social significance. During occupation by the Department of Health, the site functioned as a convalescent hospital, which was used as a public facility for the people of New South Wales. The Strickland House site is one of only two sites developed as Department of Health Convalescent Homes. Since the closure of the convalescent facility in 1989, continued public demands for all of the grounds to be public parkland demonstrate contemporary social significance. The subsequent declaration of the site as an urban park in 1994 has reinforced the social significance of the property. Contemporary community esteem is further demonstrated by ht inclusion of the property on various heritage registers, being considered one of the finest houses in Sydney from its inception, has retained the landmark status that was recognised from its mid nineteenth century establishment. The house in particular is significant in its adaptation and operation as a public facility for convalescent purposes subsequent to purchase by the NSW Government. The Northern and Southern Dormitory Blocks (A & B respectively), Nurses' Home and Caretaker's Cottage, designed and built by the Department of Public Works during the 1930s, are significant as representations of the occupation of the site for a substantial period by the Department of Health. Construction of these additional buildings to support the ongoing function of the convalescent hospital established in 1915 demonstrated the ongoing social importance of this facility to the community. The occasional use of the Nurses Home as rooms for film sets by filmmaking students represents the utility and adaptability of this building and its ongoing usefulness as a community facility. Carrara/Strickland House and its surrounding landscape have considerable community esteem at both a local and a state level. Contemporary interest in the remnant Estate clearly demonstrates the value attached to the gardens and grounds as an integral component of Carrara and a public recreation facility. \\"The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\\" \\"The high degree of integrity of both the main house interior and exterior as well as that of the garden make Carrara a valuable research tool and example of taste and style particularly during the nineteenth century. The garden, in particular, contains a valuable resource of plants and stonework\\". The remaining features of the garden and grounds of Strickland House have the potential to reveal the early cultural and natural landscape of the place. The analysis and interpretation of the archaeological remains from this site may provide evidence of the material culture of the various occupants of the site as well as contributing to the understanding of the design and development of gardens in mid nineteenth century Sydney. Any evidence of remains on the site may be able to contribute knowledge into several research questions, however with few exceptions current information indicates that the potential archaeology of the site is non specific in its nature and location. Regardless, potential archaeology at the Strickland House site may be related to the following research areas: * The material culture of Carrara/Strickland House and grounds may contain artefacts and structures whose analysis can provide us with socio-economic information about elite living conditions, including patters of consumption, in addition to working, accommodation and living conditions for employees in Victorian properties. * The analysis of the underfloor deposits may be able to add to our knowledge about identification of socio-economic status, gender relations and other areas of substantive archaeological research pertinent to the various phases of occupation. * Location of structural remains of outbuildings associated with Carrara/Strickland House would add to and improve our understanding of the layout of early Victorian estates. \\"The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\\" The house combined with its setting is a rare example of a relatively intact picturesque landscape scheme form the 1850s. The high integrity of the land immediately surrounding the house offers a rare opportunity for the appreciation of a picturesque aesthetic as designed in the mid nineteenth century. Carrara is a rare surviving example of an early Victorian mansion of substantial scale retaining not only its spacious landscaped grounds, but also its near original relationship to the harbour. It is one of the few surviving properties of this period that retains both its substantial grounds and a relationship to the water. \\"The preservation of not only the house, but the main outbuildings, drive and garden make it a rare example to survive the subdivision process\\". Carrara is an exceptionally intact and excellent example of John F Hilly's work that contains a distinctive two storey bow front veranda not common to residences designed at that time. The original fabric is of the highest quality, in particular the joinery and the stonework. Carrara and also Greycliffe House in the adjacent Nielsen Park are rare surviving examples of the domestic work of John F Hilly. Although relatively plainly finished on the exterior, the Stables building contains some very unusual features, notably: # quoins included only at the Western corner # brick masonry gable end above stone walling # the unfinished quality of the projecting stone blocks at the southern corner # the irregular projecting dry stone wall constructed along the south west facade. The specimen of tuckeroo (Cupaniopsis anacardioides) located at the top of the slope in the vicinity of Strickland House has some scientific value as an indicator of the natural littoral rainforest vegetation of the site. \\"The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\\" Carrara is an example of a marine mansion, the likes of which were constructed in the local area to accommodate socially influential families. Architecturally, the institutional buildings are comparable with other institutional buildings designed in the 1930s by the Department of Public Works. As such the buildings are of representational significance as typical examples of their time designed by a Government department.

At an early age he became Lieutenant of the Auditor of the Apostolic Chamber during the pontificate of Pope Urban VIII and was then appointed Referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signatura of Justice and of Grace. Bichi was elected Bishop of Isola on 5 May 1628) and was immediately sent to Naples as papal nuncio. In 1630 he became nuncio to France and on 9 September 1630 he was appointed Bishop of Carpentras.

Completed in in the Federation Arts and Crafts style, Greycliffe is listed on the (now defunct) Australian Register of the National EstateThe Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company (1981) p.2/135 and on the Municipality of Woollahra local government heritage list. History Greycliffe was built out of sandstone, with cedar joinery and fine quality plasterwork, for one of the daughters of William Charles Wentworth. Fanny Wentworth married John Reeve, a wealthy migrant from England.Woollahra Council Site Reeve purchased land at Shark Beach from Wentworth and commissioned the architect John Hilly to build Greycliffe, which was completed circa 1852. A sealed entrance road, originally Greycliffe's carriage dive, leads to the house. One of the decorative gables Reeve never lived in Greycliffe, preferring to travel to England with his wife. Instead, the house was leased to a string of prominent Sydney citizens, including, initially, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787-1873), MLC, the then Collector of Customs for NSW. The house provided an ideal vantage point for Gibbes, as he could watch the movements of shipping on Sydney Harbour's main channel from its north-facing verandah. Gibbes and his wife, Elizabeth, dwelt at Greycliffe until 1859‚Äîwhen he retired from the Customs Service and they moved to their new home, Yarralumla homestead, in what is now the capital city of Canberra. Yarralumla is now the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia. A succession of private leaseholders lived at Greycliffe after the departure of Mrs and Mrs Gibbes. In 1911, the house was transferred to public ownership and given over by the New South Wales Government for use as a hospital for babies and then as a mothercraft centre. Then, in 1978, the house was added to the Sydney Harbour National Park along with the recreational area surrounding it known as Nielsen Park. As it stands today, Greycliffe is a large, elaborate and well-preserved neo-Gothic Victorian house which retains unobstructed water views across to the northern shore of Sydney Harbour. It boasts multiple gables, a long entrance hall, a stately staircase and carved barge boards. Stables adjoin at the rear and the residence's gardens tumble down to the beachfront, while natural bushland frames the house to the rear. The house's upstairs interior and roof were extensively damaged by fire in 1897 but the structure was restored soon after. Greycliffe has functioned as a visitors' centre and headquarters for the Sydney Harbour National Park. The house was the setting for the Bligh family saga in the 2013 Australian television series A Place To Call Home.

The book was released in Australia on 1 November 2010, in New Zealand on 5 November 2010, and in the United States on 16 April 2011. The name Nihon-Ja is based on the name of Japan, Nihon-Koku.  Plot  Horace (the knight) is missing. Months have passed since he was sent on a military mission to the court of the Emperor of Nihon-Ja with his friend, former wardmate, and Scribeschool apprentice George, but he has failed to return. Meanwhile, Halt (a legendary Ranger), Will (another legendary Ranger), Selethen (the leader of the Arridi, a nomadic desert tribe) and Alyss (a Diplomatic Service Courier) are in Toscana overseeing a demonstration using tight formations to overcome more skilled opponents. When Evanlyn (also known as the Crown Princess Cassandra) arrives telling of Horace's absence, The Araluens and Selethen embark on a Skandian duty ship to find Horace. They find that Horace has become embroiled in Nihon- Jan politics. The arrogant Senshi sect, the Nihon-Ja warrior class, has rebelled against the rightful Emperor Shigeru out of fear he will usurp their influence in the country. Shigeru, though a Senshi himself, is also a man of the people and has been trying to reform his nation's strict social system. Horace has chosen to stay and lend support to the deposed ruler. Pursued by the rebel leader and master swordsman Arisaka, Horace and Shigeru flee along with Shigeru's cousin and guard Shukin. Their only hope is to find the fabled fortress of Ran-Koshi, which is mentioned in a legend and said to have impossibly high walls. The three lead their small entourage of 50 Senshi around the native villages recruiting Kikori, lumberjacks native to the area. After recruiting, the men flee helplessly from Arisaka and his much larger army of Senshi. However, the Emperor's party is moving slowly because they are burdened down by their injured, and are easily caught up to. In an effort to buy them more time, Shukin and nine other Senshi volunteers to stay back at a river and duel the enemy until they are killed. From a cliff, Shigeru watches as Arisaka kills his cousin and continues the pursuit. Shortly after, they come to a precipice crossed only by a rickety footbridge and quickly cross. However, as the last men are crossing Arisaka's army arrives. Horace has a rope tied around his waist and goes back onto the bridge to defend it while the heavy ropes are being cut. When it falls, Horace is bashed against the cliff and drops his sword into the precipice. Shigeru later presents a gift to the knight, a perfect copy of his blade but forged with the strong Nihon-Jan steel. With the enemy army stuck on the other side of the precipice, the party is free to carry on to Ran-Koshi. When they arrive, they discover that the legendary fortress is a valley between high cliffs, defended by a palisade at its narrow opening. The men set up camp, and the Kikori begin refurbishing the fortress as more numbers join from the surrounding villages. After they arrive, the heavy snows of the Nihon-Jan winter come in, giving the men time to prepare while Arisaka is further hindered. Come Springtime, the Ran-Koshi has been transformed into a full military fortress, but all the Emperor has for an army are 50 Senshi and 200 untrained Kikori. Unbeknownst to them, Evanlyn's party has arrived and goes out in search of Horace. They are found by Kikori scouts and brought out to Ran-Koshi. Horace welcomes his old friends and tells them of his situation. The problem reminds Will of the Toscan military demonstration, and he and Selethen begin training men to use the tortoise formation. They form four units of 50 men, heavily trained formations of men armed with large wooden shields, short swords, and javelins. Meanwhile, Alyss and Evanlyn embark on a journey across a large mountain lake to find a mythical people called the Hanasu. When they arrive on the other side, they make contact and find that the Hasanu are large mountain people covered in thick, reddish fur and are intensely loyal to their lord. When hearing about Shigeru's plight, their lord says he would help, but their way is blocked by a forest haunted by a demon that has killed 17 Hasanu, and they will not enter it. Alyss and Evanlyn go out to kill it, and discover that it is a giant snow tiger. After killing it, they bring it back and their fears dispersed, the Hasanu march for Ran-Koshi. When spring comes, Arisaka's men come through the mountains and camp at the bottom of a nearby valley. However, they are now much larger due to reinforcements from the south. Shigeru, Horace, Halt, Will and Selethen know that they are heavily outnumbered, but they prepare for battle to confront Arisaka. They prepare their formations on the plain outside Ran-Koshi, and kill hundreds of Arisaka's infantry. But just as they are about to engage again, another army arrives, carrying hundreds more to Arisaka's aid under the Lord Yamada, who has been deceived into supporting the rebel lord. As the enemy arrives, the Hasanu arrive as well, with three thousand fierce warriors. Arisaka prepares to fight to the end, but Shigeru stops the battle, and says that he will give up his position as emperor if it will save hundreds of his people dying. Arisaka's army, awed by Shigeru's display, desert their lord and lay down their weapons. As Arisaka charges the Emperor, blinded with hate, Will hurls a saxe knife at his neck, killing him. With the battle won, Shigeru returns to his position as Emperor to restabilize Nihon-Ja. Shigeru gives Horace a painting with which to remember him by, and they head back to Araluen. In the end, Horace and Evanlyn become engaged, and Will mentions to Alyss that they should do the same.

It is best known for its publications dealing with nautical subjects. History Conway Maritime Press was founded in 1972 as an independent publisher. Its origins lay in catering for a specialised readership, publishing quarterly journals such as Model Shipwright and Warship, which would subsequently evolve into the popular annuals still existent today. These, along with the long-running Anatomy of the Ship series, published in conjunction with the Naval Institute Press in the United States, have become stalwarts of the Conway catalogue. Over its history, it has built an extensive catalogue of books specialising in maritime heritage, ship design and construction, and naval military history, from authoritative figures such as Brian Lavery, 'one of the best naval historians in Britain, if not the world,' according to BBC History Magazine.Duncan Redford, 'Review', BBC History Magazine (March 2010) Nautical Magazine wrote, of Richard Endsor's Restoration Warship, 'From the dust cover into the book and right the way through it, this is a magnificent publication with a tremendous amount of detail.''Review', Nautical Magazine (March 2010) Conway Publishing In 2005 Anova Books bought Conway Maritime Press. Around this time the publisher was renamed Conway Publishing. Whilst still committed to producing specialist maritime books, Conway broadened their catalogue to incorporate general, military and aviation history, exploration, as well as railway and scale modelling (with Hornby and Airfix), amongst other related topics.'Introductions', Writers' News (June 2010) In recent years, Conway has found success with several television series tie-ins. In line with the current heritage culture espoused by television shows such as BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? and coordinating with several recent international anniversaries, Conway released a series of popular nostalgic reproduction wartime pocket- books ranging from officers' manuals, the Spitfire, to the Home Guard. Conway has also produced the books to accompany James May's Toy Stories and the Dan Snow-presented Empire of the Seas, both aired on the BBC. The latter book, written by Brian Lavery, would become a No. 2 Sunday Times Bestseller. In April 2010, Conway attained the book rights to Bruce Parry's Arctic adventure, broadcast on BBC2 later in the year.Katie Allen, 'Parry explores Arctic for Anova', Bookseller (23 April 2010) In September 2014 Bloomsbury Publishing bought Conway from Anova to join its existing Adlard Coles Nautical imprint.

The club currently has 3 teams playing in the Leinster Senior League. This ever-growing south Dublin club is a very dedicated and proud football club with a long history within the local communities of Terenure, Templeogue, and Knocklyon, spanning almost 40 years. With its constantly expanding membership and infrastructure, this club will continue to make history, for years to come. History On 8 December 1966, almost 107 years after the birth of Terenure College on Dublin's southside, an organised group of pupils of the college, complete with manager, formed a football team, adopted the name Springfield F.C. and played an obscure football match against a team called Madonna Y.C. The prime movers of this inaugural fixture were college pupils Philip Jones, John Chadwick and Derek & Bobby Stewart. Other players also involved in this match were Noel Germaine, Ray McInerney and Paul Meade. The team continued to play only friendly matches as Springfield F.C., until they entered the Dublin Schoolboys Under 17 & 18 Divisions the following year. This group of Terenure College pupils are unofficially attributed to be the forefathers in forming the catalyst that produced the football club known today as Terenure College Association Football Club. However, the true origins of the club are traced back to the College School Football Team of 1969 who won the inaugural Leinster Schools Cup Championship, only 3 years following Springfield F.C.'s inception. Subsequent to their Leinster Schools Cup Glory, the School team of '69 were invited to participate in the European Schools Championships the following year, hosted in Kaiserslautern in (then) West Germany. Although this Under 18 team did not progress from the group stages of this Under 20 Tournament, they did outdo themselves, and proudly secured the overall Fair Play Award for the efforts in the tournament. Upon returning home and completion of the Leaving Certificate Examination, the team agreed to stay together after graduating from Terenure College. They assumed the name \\"Collegians\\", and entered the Universities & Colleges League, the forerunner of the current UCD Super League. At this stage, the season of 1970/71, the team was managed by John McClean captained by Ray McInerney and included Pat Diffney, Aiden Farrell, Alban Colwell, Tommy Foster, Paul McGee, Pat Jordan, Terry Jones, John Walsh and John O'Connor. The lads played on as \\"Collegians\\" until the end of the 1971/72 season, when the name was changed to Terenure College A.F.C. and they subsequently joined the Amateur League Division 2 Sunday. In their first season as Terenure College A.F.C., the pupils won the prestigious Leinster Junior Shield by beating Mellowes B.D.S. 5-2 in the final. It was a remarkable achievement to win this trophy in a competition, containing 164 teams, in only their first season at this level. Further success was achieved in the following season of 1973/74 by winning the Division 2 Sunday title. A feat that was repeated exactly 30 years later. Current Terenure College A.F.C most recently reached the final of Leinster Senior League - Vere Deane Cup, losing 2-1 in extra time to Lucan United. This was the club's first cup final in a number of years. Currently Terenure College A.F.C has two teams currently complete in Prem Saturday and Premier Sunday of the Leinster Senior League. Colours and crest Terenure College A.F.C. play in the traditional colours of the college, purple/white/black. Pitch Terenure College A.F.C. have had a long affiliation with Terenure College and have been playing their matches on the school grounds since their foundation in 1972.

Following the second world war, when primary and secondary raw materials were extremely scarce, a handful of leading private recycling companies from the Benelux countries called for the creation of an international organisation to overcome trade barriers and to facilitate cross-border business, principally to supply steel mills, foundries and paper mills. This initiative was therefore was started in Europe and was eventually expand its reach to the worldwide stage. The process started in March 1948 when leading recyclers met in Amsterdam. Following this first meeting, the presidents of the Belgian and Dutch scrap organisations invited Luxembourg, France and Great Britain to join BIR. Later, the same invitation would be extended to the Scandinavian countries. BIR soon became acknowledged by national and international bodies, as well as by governments. Other countries applied for membership including Switzerland, the United States and Sweden. In 1953, during the BIR Convention in Paris, the Federal Republic of Germany also joined. In 1971 BIR moved its headquarters from Paris to Brussels, the seat of the European Union (EU), and this move brought with it some changes to the organisation - in particular, the formation of three independent European scrap trade associations (called today EFR, EUROMETREC and ERPA) which were created to look after the interests of their specific recycling sectors within the EU and to represent the recycling industry at the EU Commission. On a world level, BIR continued to expand to other non-EU countries, and in particular into Eastern Europe, Russia and Asia, eventually changing name to become the Bureau of International Recycling. Subsequently, new communications programmes and tools were developed and direct membership from commercial enterprises was encouraged, particularly from countries where there were no national federations.

Biography He was born in Leeds in 1865,England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837-1915 the son of William and Hannah Crossland. He was baptised in a nonconformist church in Leeds on 3 September 1865.West Yorkshire, Non- Conformist Records, 1646-1985 He was an associate and friend of Lord Alfred Douglas, who was Oscar Wilde's lover. The bitter feud between Lord Alfred's father the Marquess of Queensberry and his son resulted in Wilde suing the Marquess for libel at Douglas's urging. Subsequently Wilde was charged with homosexuality after the Marquess produced evidence of Wilde's behaviour as justifying the libel. In 1895 Wilde was found guilty and imprisoned. After the trial Crosland united with Douglas, who had become a pious Catholic, and together they persecuted Robbie Ross in the civil courts in a variety of actions. They also repeatedly wrote and visited the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions, trying to ensure Ross's arrest for homosexual offences. Fryer, J \\"Robert Ross. Oscar Wilde's Devoted Friend\\", pp. 75‚Äì90 and passim In 1913 the author Arthur Ransome recalled \\"the rather endearing story of his (Crosland's) first arrival in London from Yorkshire, by road, pushing a perambulator that was shared by manuscripts and a baby\\". This was at the trial of Ransome and others for libelling Douglas in Ransome's 1912 book on Wilde; Crosland and the impecunious Douglas had hoped for substantial damages but lost. When Douglas was declared bankrupt in February 1913, his solicitor had informed the court that damages of ¬£2,500 \\"a fortune\\", were expected, which alarmed Ransome when he saw it in The Times. The judge was rather scathing about Douglas's behaviour in the box, and the jury found that the words complained of were a libel but were true. Ransome's biographer referred to Crosland as a \\"shady associate\\" of Douglas, and Ross's biographer calls him \\"a narrow-minded bigot\\" and a \\"right-wing Tory\\". Crosland wrote a condemnation of Wilde's De Profundis, in verse, titled The First Stone, in 1912, and ghost- wrote Douglas's memoir Oscar Wilde and Myself in 1914. In 1914, Robbie Ross, Oscar Wilde's literary executor and rival for Wilde's affection, charged Crosland with criminal libel, plus writs for criminal conspiracy and perjury against Douglas and Crosland jointly. Crosland was found not guilty, though the judge did say that acquittal would not imply that Ross was guilty of any offence. Crosland was a humanitarian who frequently wrote in his poems about the impoverished and sick and unemployed, especially caring about returned soldiers in the First World War. After many illnesses, he died in Surrey in 1924, leaving a wife and son. A biography, The life and genius of T.W.H. Crosland, by W. Sorley Brown was published in 1928.

Pachauri on the balcony of Grand Hotel, Oslo, Norway, on 10 December 2007. The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was shared, in two equal parts, between the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Al Gore \\"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change\\". Announcement The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on 12 October 2007. It stated that responses to indications of future climate changes must follow the precautionary principle, and that extensive changes would damage living standards, leading to likelihood of wars and violent conflicts. It paid tribute to the work of the IPCC: It said that \\"Al Gore has for a long time been one of the world's leading environmentalist politicians\\", and described him as \\"probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted.\\" In conclusion, it said the Nobel Committee was \\"seeking to contribute to a sharper focus on the processes and decisions that appear to be necessary to protect the world‚Äôs future climate, and thereby to reduce the threat to the security of mankind. Action is necessary now, before climate change moves beyond man‚Äôs control.\\" The award was given immediate publicity: an Associated Press article published by USA Today on 12 October 2007 and headlined \\"Gore, scientists share Nobel Peace Prize\\" quoted Pachauri as saying \\"All the scientists that have contributed to the work of the IPCC are the Nobel laureates who have been recognized and acknowledged by the Nobel Prize Committee\\". He added that \\"they should feel deeply encouraged and inspired. It is their contribution which has been recognized\\", and said \\"I only happen to be a functionary that essentially oversees the process.\\" On the same day, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory listed its scientists who had contributed to the IPCC's work, and said that Pachauri had sent a letter to lead authors of the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report saying that he had \\"been stunned in a pleasant way with the news of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for the IPCC. This makes each of you a Nobel Laureate and it is my privilege to acknowledge this honour on your behalf\\". The letter went on to say that \\"The fact that the IPCC has earned the recognition that this award embodies, is really a tribute to your knowledge, hard work and application.\\" Presentation In Oslo on 10 December 2007, the presentation was made with a speech by Ole Danbolt Mj√∏s as Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and followed by Nobel Lectures given by Rajendra K. Pachauri, representing the IPCC, and Al Gore. In his lecture, Pachauri thanked those contributing to the IPCC: IPCC certificates The IPCC presented scientists who had \\"contributed substantially to the preparation of IPCC reports\\" with personalized certificates for \\"contributing to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 to the IPCC\\".

It was produced by Revel Films and distributed by Warner Bros Pictures. Phas Gaye Re Obama is a comedy set against the backdrop of global recession/meltdown that originated in the US. It released to positive reviews and was well appreciated by critics. The film was remade in Telugu as Sankarabharanam.Sankarabharanam based on Hindi filmNow, Telugu remake of Phas Gaye Re Obama Plot The story begins with Anni (Manu Rishi) and his gangster colleagues who all work for Bhai Sahab (Sanjay Mishra), a gangster, watching U.S president Barack Obama's famous speech 'Yes We Can' on TV. Anni is shown as a big fan of Obama and wants to migrate to the US. In the US, Om Shastri (Rajat Kapoor), a businessman has faced huge losses due to recession and is all set to lose his house if he can't pay his $100,000 loan in the next thirty days. He comes to India to sell his ancestral property in Uttar Pradesh as his last hope. But the recession has also hit India and he struggles to find a buyer. Anni meets Om who promises him to take him to US, Anni in excitement tells Bhai Sahab who thinks Om is rich and orders his kidnapping. He hopes to get a good ransom so that his bad time (due to recession) ends. Om is kidnapped but later tells Bhai Sahab and his men that he is bankrupt. Thanks to the local police, one of the local gangsters Ali comes to know about Om and orders Bhai Sahab to hand over to him. Anni comes with the idea of selling Om to Ali. Anni, Bhai Sahab and his men chant 'Yes We Can' out of happiness. Om on hearing their conversation suggests Bhai Sahab and him share the money, in return he would not tell Ali about their cheating. The deal happens and Bhai Sahab gets 3 million. Bhai Sahab then transfers half the amount to Om's bank account in the US. The other gangster comes to know about Om's bankruptcy. But Om saves his and Anni's life by telling the same idea. The price now is Rs. 6 million and divided equally. Om is then sold for 6 million to Munni (Neha Dhupia), a dreaded female gangster who hates men. Om is happy because he receives 3 million and now there is a total of 4.5 million (US$100,000) in his bank account and tells his wife to pay off the loan. But soon Munni comes to know about Om's state and captures Bhai Sahab and his men. Om again saves his and others life from Munni asking her to play the same trick with local Minister and politician Dhanajay Singh (Amole Gupte). So Munni takes Om to Dhanajay Singh. The Minister runs a kidnapping Mafia and is the head of all kidnappings. Minister pays Munni 15 million and keeps Om and Anni at his guest house. Om and Anni come to know that they will be killed if Om's wife doesn't pay the ransom. At night, Om fakes a heart attack and escapes with Anni. The Minister orders the police for a manhunt. Realizing that he cannot escape to Delhi, he comes with a new plan. He goes to the local police station where the Minister is there and surrenders to him. The minister is about to take Om back to the guest house when Anni along with the Minister's supporters and local media arrive. The minister has no option but to release Om. Om, on the other hand, tells the media to project the Minister as the next Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh for saving his life. While on his way to Delhi to catch a flight back to the US, Om is stopped by Bhai Sahab and Munni. Munni gives Om his share but Om tells her to give it to his Indian relatives. Om leaves and Anni stays back in India. In the last scene, Munni asks Bhai Sahab if they can be partners and he replies, \\"Yes, we can\\".

He didn't get many opportunities thereafter, leaving him \\"frustrated\\". Stating the reason for choosing the recession as the theme, he said, > \\"The producers would say 'We are facing recession'. The frustration was more > from the fact that recession was something in which we had no role to play. > Like many of our problems, it was also a creation of the U.S. So, in a way, > to give vent to my anger I wrote a satire. I thought when the whole world > was affected by recession how could the underworld and politicians stay away > from it. So I created a set of gangsters who have no money in their pockets. > They pin their hopes on an NRI, who also turns out to be hit by recession.\\" Before turning director, Subhash Kapoor, as a journalist toured North India extensively, and it is reflected in the dialect that the characters speak. This was the reason he opted for kidnapping as the \\"industry\\" that got affected by recession. \\"Kidnapping has become an industry in the region and often the characters involved in action have a humorous take on life\\", noted Kapoor. He drew inspiration from real life politicians for the character portrayed by Amol Gupte. \\"The character of the politician played by Amol Gupte is drawn from D.P. Yadav and Shibu Soren and some of his actions remind one of Raja Bhaiyya\\", said Kapoor. He created a female don character in Phas Gaye Re Obama to show her as a \\"larger-than-life character\\" and to show her as competing with \\"her male counterparts in the kidnapping industry\\" and cast Neha Dhupia for the role. Dhupia had to learn the dialect after watching Mayawati speak. \\"As I play a gangster from UP in the film, I had to get that language right and so I observed Mayawati to learn how she speaks. She is the only woman whose dialect, whether she is serious or funny, is extremely monotonous. So I have tried to incorporate this in my character. However, my character is not inspired by her\\", she said. She made her singing debut, recording a song with Kailash Kher for the film. Reception Phas Gaye Re Obama mostly garnered positive reviews. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN praised the film as a \\"deliciously smart comedy\\" and gave it a rating of 3.5 out of a scale of 5. He appreciated Manu Rishi for bringing \\"perfect degree of na√Øvete to his role of a gangster‚Äôs moderately-educated sidekick yearning for a better life.\\" Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India praised the film for its \\"ticklish humor and trick-and-treat plot line\\". \\"Phas Gaye Re Obama is a delightful end-of- the-year surprise package\\", she said. Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times rated the it at 3 out of a scale of 5 and described the film as a \\"black comedy\\" and credited the director for his \\"superbly written\\" script. Sukanya Verma of Rediff too gave a positive review about the film and said that there is \\"absolutely no dearth of LOL inducing moments\\". She extolled Sanjay Mishra, saying that \\"though he doesn't have as many scenes as Rajat Kapoor or Manu Rishi, that doesn't keep him from owning the scenes he features in\\". She declared it as \\"insane and awesome\\". Anupama Chopra of NDTV appreciated the director but felt that he couldn't \\"sustain his energy in the second half. Despite the hiccups Phas Gaye Re Obama has genuine laughs and surprising insight\\". Anuj Kumar of The Hindu lauded the director Subhash Kapoor for coming up with a \\"well-textured satire on recession that almost turns out to be a winner\\". He also felt that \\"it would have been better if Kapoor had not cast Neha Dhupia as the male-hating ganglord as she looks the odd one out in the midst of a proficient set of actors like Sanjay Mishra, Manu Rishi and Amol Gupte, who have got the pulse of the screenplay\\". The film was well appreciated by the critics for its quirky interpretation of Barack Obama's Yes We Can slogan to suit the setting.

His older brother was Robert Brandard. John Brandard was baptized on 13 March 1812 at St Martin's church in Birmingham. He began his career as an engraver, mainly of commercial designs. On 17 January 1833 he married Maria Chater at Edgbaston in Birmingham. They had five children, one of whom, Walter Robert Brandard (1842‚Äì1869), was also briefly a designer of sheet music covers.Joanna Selborne, ‚ÄòBrandard family (per. c.1825‚Äì1898)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 29 March 2012 He worked in a lifelong partnership with the lithographic printers M. & N.

His portraits of dancers were admired by Degas. He usually charged 20 guineas for his original artwork and lived well from the proceeds of his art. Described as \\" an imposing, dandified figure\\", he would often arrive at theatres in Drury Lane or Covent Garden in his own coach and horses. He was succeeded by Alfred Concanen as master of the illustrated sheet music cover. John Brandard died at his home 8 Southampton Place in Chalk Farm, north London, on 15 December 1863. Collections of his work are held at Reading University, at the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Library at the Bodleian Library in Oxford and the largest collection in America is with Lynch Resources in Edmonds, Wa.

Taxonomy and etymology The Antipodes Island snipe was first collected by Fairchild in 1887, and by Andreas Reischek in 1888. It was first described by Walter Rothschild in 1893 as Gallinago tristrami in honour of Henry Baker Tristram. However, doubts were raised about the provenance of the type specimen, which appeared to be from the Auckland Islands, and Rothschild made a new description in 1927, recognising the Antipodes Island form as a subspecies of Coenocorypha aucklandica. The subspecific name honours British ornithologist Annie Meinertzhagen, the second wife of ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen.Hartert (1927). Description The Antipodes Island snipe is similar to the nominate subspecies ‚Äì the Auckland Island snipe ‚Äì but differs in being darker above and with yellower underparts.Oliver (1955). Distribution and habitat The snipe is endemic to the Antipodes group, which has a total surface area of 22 km2. It has been recorded not only from the main Antipodes Island, but also from the much smaller Bollons, Archway and Inner Windward Islands. It inhabits the islands‚Äô tussock grasslands and herbfields, nesting under tussocks and Polystichum vestitum shield ferns.Higgins & Davies (1996). Behaviour=Breeding Breeding is seasonal, with egg-laying beginning in mid to late August. The typical clutch size is two. ‚ÄúHakawai‚Äù aerial displays have been recorded.Miskelly et al. (2006). Feeding The snipe have been recorded as feeding on a variety of invertebrates, including annelids, amphipods, isopods, arachnids and insects. Status and conservation The population of the snipe is estimated at 8,000 birds.Melville & Battley (2006).

Biography Gerard Hoet trained with his father and brother who were glass painters, and Warnard van Rijsen, who lived in Zaltbommel, and who himself was a pupil of Cornelis van Poelenburgh in Utrecht. Gerard Hoet biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature In 1672 Hoet moved to The Hague, but when the Count of Salis bought paintings at his mother's house in Zaltbommel, Hoet returned to paint for him. Traveling in Europe Hoet accompanied the Count of Salis to Rees, Germany, where he met the Utrecht painters Jan van Bunnik, Justus Nieuwpoort and Andries de Wit. Hoet returned to Utrecht with De Wit, where he worked for Frederick Nassau de Zuylestein briefly before visiting the Hague and Amsterdam. He then traveled to France on the promise from a Marquis who wanted to give him a commission, but this promise falling through, he made some engravings of paintings by Francisque Millet. He then wanted to travel to England, but having written to his compatriot Lucas Vorsterman, he received word that there was more work to be had in Paris. Hoet traveled to Paris where he spent more than a year, before returning to the Netherlands via Brussels. In Brussels he met the painter Adriaen Frans Boudewyns, who convinced him to stay a while. After eight months, Hoet returned to Utrecht, where he worked for William Nassau de Zuylestein, 1st Earl of Rochford. He married and settled in Heemstede, where he found work for the lord of the castle there. Utrecht drawing academy Together with the painter Hendrik Schoock, in 1697 he asked the Utrecht city council for permission to found a drawing academy, which was granted. During this period he painted decorations in leading homes of gentlemen in the Utrecht area, most notably the castles of Slangenborg and Voorst near Zutphen, the latter of which he painted for Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle. Later years In 1715 he returned to The Hague, where he spent the rest of his life.Gerard Hoet in the RKD He had a business as an art dealer in collaboration with the Flemish painter Jacques Ignatius de Roore who resided in The Hague.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 1172-1179 He taught his sons Hendrik Jacob and Gerard, as well as Nicolaes van Ravesteyn (II). His son Gerard Hoet II was an amateur painter and art collector who lived on the Lange Voorhout 62.

His most important engravings on a large scale were Turner's \\"Crossing the Brook\\", \\"The Snow-storm\\", and \\"The Bay of Baiae\\". He also published two volumes of etchings, chiefly landscapes, after his own designs. He occasionally exhibited small oil pictures at the British Institution, which were distinguished by a good feeling for nature and a healthy tone of colour.

Biography Davis was born in Cardiff, Wales in 1910, the only child of a Swiss mother and English father. He was educated in Switzerland and England, and was fluent in German. After school he was sent to the Bournemouth School of Art where the pottery class was oversubscribed. Undaunted, he worked in the pottery room after hours, turning out large numbers of enormous pots which drew the attention of the headmaster. He was sent to Broadstone Potters, near Poole, which had been established in 1928 by Lancelot Cayley Shadwell and Mary Longbottom. Initially, he worked as a decorator, responsible for the \\"Joyous Pottery\\" range, but soon showed interest in all aspects of the craft. He came under the tutelage of a certain Mr. Bean who instructed him in the skills needed at a potter's wheel. Harry and May Davis after their arrival in New Zealand, August 1962 With the demise of Broadstone Potters in 1933, he applied for a job with the studio potter, Bernard Leach, and ended up working for him and David Leach at the Leach Pottery in St Ives, Cornwall. Davis acknowledged the invaluable experience he gained from Bernard Leach, especially for the honing of his aesthetic appreciation of ceramics. During this period he spent long hours in London museums, making copious notes and drawings of pots he found interesting. He left St Ives in 1937 to become Head of the Art School at Achimota College on the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana). Here he examined the feasibility of manufacturing tiles, bricks and pots. In London in 1938 he married May Davis, whom he had met at Leach Pottery, and she accompanied him on his return to Africa. The outbreak of World War II found May stuck in England and Harry in Africa. He remained until 1942, managing to find local sources of clay and glazes. Davis recommended that Michael Cardew succeed him. In the interim May had joined the \\"Hutterian Society of Brothers\\" aka the Bruderhof Communities and moved to Paraguay, the only country willing to harbour a pacifist community such as theirs. Harry eventually joined her there towards the end of the war, but had trouble in accepting the group's way of life. Harry and May found themselves in nearby Asuncion where Harry obtained work in a pipe and tile factory. Not long after they moved to Patagonia, and he found work with a china clay company. Harry Davis demonstrating in Sydney, 1972 Returning to England in 1946, they started up \\"Crowan Pottery\\", near Praze in Cornwall, producing domestic ware. The fine appearance and strength of Crowan pots became legendary. Despite having managed the flourishing pottery for 16 years, the couple became restless. With the Cold War becoming ever more threatening, they chose to emigrate to New Zealand in 1962, arriving with four children and their apprentice, Stephen Carter. They founded the \\"Crewenna Pottery\\" at Wakapuaka near Nelson. Wanderlust once more gripped them. Harry set off to Peru in 1972, with May following a year later. Here they spent eight years of their life building a pottery at Izcuchaca, 9,500 feet high in the Andes. In 1979 May returned to New Zealand and Harry, in poor health, shortly after. He died at \\"Crewenna\\" in 1986. Davis travelled widely, lecturing on pottery, and writing \\"The Potters Alternative\\" as well as an unpublished autobiography.

He currently works as an adjunct professor teaching philosophy courses in the classroom and online at numerous schools in the Kansas City, Missouri area and other areas of the United States. Education Arp completed his undergraduate degree in philosophy at The Catholic University of America (CUA) in 1992,https://www.robertarp.com/BA%20CUA%20Diploma.jpg his master's degree in philosophy at CUA in 1993,https://www.robertarp.com/MA%20CUA%20Diploma.jpg and PhD in philosophy at Saint Louis University (SLU) during the 2004‚Äì2005 school year.https://www.robertarp.com/SLU%20PhD%20Diploma.jpg He was awarded a prestigious Theodore B. Basselin Scholarship while at CUA, and was a teaching fellow, research fellow, and dissertation fellow during his time at SLU. Arp taught as an assistant professor of philosophy at Southwest Minnesota State University (2005‚Äì2006) and then as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Florida State University for a year with Michael Ruse (2006‚Äì2007), as well as at many schools in the St. Louis, Missouri area as an adjunct professor of philosophy (1996‚Äì2005), before doing postdoctoral research in ontology through the National Center for Biomedical Ontology with Mark Musen and Barry Smith at the University at Buffalo (2007‚Äì2009). Work in ethics Arp's paper in International Philosophical Quarterly titled \\"Vindicating Kant's Morality\\" offers a defense of Immanuel Kant's position against those who would claim that Kant's moral position lacks a motivational component, ignores the spiritual dimensions of morality espoused by a virtue- based ethics, overemphasizes the principle of autonomy in neglecting the communal context of morality, and lacks a theological foundation. In \\"The Double Life of Justice and Injustice in Thrasymachus' Account,\\" published in Polis: The Journal for Ancient Greek Political Thought (1999, 16:1-2, 17-29), Arp argues that Thrasymachus, the primary interlocutor of Socrates in Book I of Plato's Republic, actually defines three types of people in a society: the tyrant, the citizens of the society that the tyrant exploits, and the person who wants to be the tyrant and who's clever enough not to be exploited by the tyrant. His argument is unique in the 70-year history of scholarship in this area, since most commentators recognize merely the tyrant and the citizens exploited by the tyrant. By identifying this third type of person, Arp is able to show that Thrasymachus' three statements regarding justice in Republic I are consistent with one another, namely: justice is (1) \\"nothing other than the advantage of the stronger\\" (338c); justice is (2) obeying the laws of the ruler(s) (339b); justice is (3) \\"really someone else's good, the advantage of the man who is stronger and rules\\" (343c). With Arthur Caplan, Arp edited Contemporary Debates in Bioethics through John Wiley & Sons, containing new papers written by experts in bioethics and applied ethics such as Don Marquis, Tom Beauchamp, Mark Cherry, William J. Winslade, Jane Maienschein, Edwin Black, Richard Arneson, and others. Work in modern philosophy In his paper titled \\"The Quinque Viae of Thomas Hobbes\\" (1999, 16:4, 367-394), published in History of Philosophy Quarterly, Arp argues that Hobbes actually endorses proofs for the existence of God that are similar to Thomas Aquinas and found in the very tradition of Scholasticism that he would seem to reject so vehemently. This view has been applauded, as well as derided. In \\"Re-thinking Hobbes's Materialistic and Mechanistic Projects\\" (2002, 15:1, 3-31), published in Hobbes Studies, Arp maintained that he is in the camp of scholars who read the texts of the great philosophers, such as Hobbes, rather than interpret the texts of philosophers in ways that might lead to anachronism or other types of fallacy in scholarly method. More recently, in his chapter titled \\"If the Devil Did Not Exist, It May Be Necessary to Invent Him in Certain Contexts\\" published in a book titled, Philosophical Approaches to the Devil, through Routledge's Studies in the Philosophy of Religion series, Arp argues not only that Voltaire's claim, \\"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him\\" is probably false given the preponderance of non-theistic ethical systems, but also that the claim \\"If the Devil did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him\\" is false as well. However, he does argue that it is \\"not unreasonable to utilize God and the Devil as makeshifts for psychological comfort and social order, given a context in which we have people who are not able to self-soothe or act correctly without the fear of God's judgment and the Devil's pitchfork. So, the upshot is that if God and the Devil did not exist‚Äîor do not exist‚Äîit may be necessary to invent them in certain contexts.\\" Work in philosophy of biology Concerning biological function, Arp has put forward a middle position between the two viable accounts of function today‚Äînamely, the organizational account of function (usually attributed to Robert Cummins) and the modern history account of function (usually attributed to Paul Griffiths and Peter Godfrey-Smith)‚Äîand his position has been called \\"reconciliatory\\" and \\"pluralist.\\" His article with Barry Smith titled \\"Function, role and disposition in basic formal ontology\\" published in Nature Precedings has been cited more than 100 times, according to Google Scholar. Besides his work in functions and teleology, Arp has attempted a definition of life, arguing that the \\"components and attending processes of an organism must be considered as living, emergent phenomena because of the way in which the components are organized to maintain homeostasis of the organism at the various levels in the organismic hierarchy.\\" He calls this position the homeostatic organization view of biological phenomena. With Alexander Rosenberg, Arp has edited Philosophy of Biology: An Anthology (Wiley- Blackwell, 2009), with Francisco J. Ayala, he has edited Contemporary Debates in Philosophy of Biology (Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), and with George Terzis, he has edited Information and Living Systems: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives (MIT Press, 2011). Arp has also offered suggestions for the interactions of philosophers and scientists as they go about their work in philosophy of science.  Work in cognitive science and evolutionary psychology  In his first book published through MIT Press, Scenario Visualization: An Evolutionary Account of Creative Problem Solving, Arp adds to Steven Mithen's cognitive fluidity view by arguing that such fluidity would be random and chaotic without mechanisms of selection and integration. Thus, what he calls \\"scenario visualization\\" is a necessary ingredient in creative problem solving, and likely was one of the first things that emerged in human consciousness. Scenario visualization is defined by Arp as a \\"conscious ability to segregate and integrate visual images in future scenarios.\\" While this view has been applauded as \\"innovative and interesting,\\" a \\"valuable resource and a stimulating contribution,\\" and even \\"ambitious,\\" there are those who critique Arp's position as \\"saying nothing new\\" and suffering from \\"a form of selectivity deficit ‚Äì an inability to judge what is and isn't relevant to his claims.\\" Arp's view continues to be referred to as plausible by cognitive scientists and others doing work in artificial intelligence, philosophical psychology, and other areas of study.  Work in ontology  Arp has worked as an ontologist with the CGI Group and BAE Systems on projects for the United States Air Force, National Institutes of Health, and United States Army. He has published papers dealing with philosophy of science and conceptual models and produced numerous technical documents as a technical writer. Arp has also used RDF, RDFS, OWL, and SPARQL to assist in building ontologies for the Next Generation Air Transportation System, making use of ontology-building tools such as TopBraid and Prot√©g√©. He was part of the initial steps in developing the world's first weather ontology with other ontologists at Lincoln Laboratory. He was also part of the genesis of the Infectious Disease Ontology through meetings and discussions in 2007 and 2008. The Infectious Disease Ontology is one of the ontologies in the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry, also known as the OBO Foundry. As a theoretical ontologist, having worked closely with Barry Smith (also a philosopher/ontologist), Arp has contributed to Smith's Basic Formal Ontology in the areas of function, role, and disposition. Arp's book with Smith and Andrew Spear published in 2015 through MIT Press, Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology, has been cited more than 250 times on Google Scholar. Within the context of Basic Formal Ontology, biology, and bioinformatics, although Arp's definition of function has been criticized as inapplicable to \\"entities above or below a certain size,\\" the definition not only offers an attempt at a \\"coherence between the concepts of biological function and technical function,\\" but it also has been utilized by researchers doing work in biochemical processes, hypersensitivity conditions, service systems, and domain conceptual modeling in general. Like Barry Smith, Arp also has sought to defend a common sense realist position concerning the construction of domain ontologies (essentially, scientific realism) whereby a domain ontology should, if possible and appropriate, represent the actual entities out there in the world that fall under the purview of science. One argument Arp puts forward is a restatement of the \\"no-miracles argument\\" for scientific realism which states that it would be miraculous if scientific theories were not at least approximately true descriptions of the world, since they are so (seemingly) successful at prediction and control. He has argued for this position in the past. However, cognizant of the difficulties surrounding a realist position (especially for practical, working ontologists), Arp has argued for a form of as-if philosophical realism, along the lines of Immanuel Kant and Hans Vaihinger whereby the \\"commitment to the pursuit of abstract objects could become instrumental in guiding the life of philosophy and science in a limited as if manner.\\" Just as Kant spoke of the value of the regulative ideas as aiding in, not only the rounding off of our systematic picture of reality, but also prompting us to do further research and investigation, so too, according to Arp thinkers are to act as if there is a reality \\"out there\\" (the ding-an-sich or noumenon, as it were) when they construct domain ontologies or engage in any other kind of scientific endeavor. Given the as-if nature of this position, similar to that of Hans Vaihinger, there is always the possibility that there may be practical or pragmatic concerns in building domain ontologies which actually trump the realist pursuit, and Arp is mindful of this possibility. Also, following other ontologists he has drawn a distinction between philosophical ontology (physical ontology), domain ontology, and upper ontology (information science) (also known as top-level or formal) ontology, and has attempted to articulate principles for best practices in the building of domain ontologies in radiology, cell signaling, bioethics, and finance.  Work in religious studies  Arp has added to the discussion concerning the issue of classifying mystical union with the One in the Neoplatonism of Plotinus, a topic in mysticism with a crossover in religious experience and spirituality more generally. In contradistinction to the theistic union view (where the soul retains its identity in union with the One) on one hand, and the monistic identity view (where the soul loses its identity in union with the One) on the other, Arp has argued in a much-cited paper titled \\"Plotinus, Mysticism, and Mediation\\" in the prestigious journal Religious Studies for what he calls a \\"mediated union\\" position in the doctrines of Plotinus where the noetic part of the soul is not fully transcended in union with the One. Arp also has published on mystics such as Lydwina of Schiedam, Margaret of Castello, Saint Benedict Joseph Labre, Saint Rita of Cascia, and others who claim that God's goodness and love can be experienced through, or in the midst of, pain and suffering. Drawing on the work of Simone Weil and Diogenes Allen, he offers a unique theodicy as a response to the problem of evil in his paper titled \\"Suffering as Theodicy\\" from the journal Cahiers Simone Weil. Borrowing the concept of solidarity as utilized by the famous environmental ethicist Robin Attfield in his view known as biocentric consequentialism, Arp has sought to establish a Ubiquitous Ethical Principle of Solidarity. Deriving its modern usage from the French solidarit√© meaning ‚Äúcommunion of interests and responsibilities‚Äù or ‚Äúmutual responsibility,‚Äù the concept of solidarity was championed by √âmile Durkheim in his De la division du travail social: √©tude sur l'organisation des soci√©t√©s sup√©rieures (The Division of Labor in Society, 1893). There, Durkheim envisions solidarit√© as a kind of human fraternity dependent upon the existence of personal bonds, which are needed for the realization of common goals or ideals within groups. Unlike justice, which tends to focus on rules and principles without specific references to personal bonds, solidarity requires an acknowledgement of subjective ties; it involves a degree of sentiment de camaraderie, or fellow feeling, which is shared by subjects within or between groups. Durkheim was part of numerous Judeo- Christian ethical and political systems that responded to the Industrial Revolution at the close of the 19th Century. Arp tries to extend Attfield's notion of solidarity and show how, in addition to the Judeo-Christian tradition, solidarity as an ethical principle may be found in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Confucianism, Daoism, Islam, as well as in certain traditional African religions, and Native American religions and among the religions of Indigenous Australians. It is through the ubiquitousness of solidarity, then, that issues having to do with local, national, and global forms of environmental justice (for example, poverty, human rights deprivation, environmental racism) may be confronted. Religious beliefs are part of the very fabric of human existence, so if a religious-based ethical sentiment can be harnessed‚Äîas one finds in solidarity‚Äîand used as a motivator for confronting environmental injustice, then it is more likely to be enduring. So claims Arp.  Work in philosophy and popular culture  Arp has chapters in more than 40 books in the genre known colloquially as Philosophy and Popular Culture, including Metallica and Philosophy, Family Guy and Philosophy, Lost and Philosophy, 24 and Philosophy, The Office and Philosophy, Battlestar Galactica and Philosophy, Watchmen and Philosophy, Final Fantasy and Philosophy, Alice in Wonderland and Philosophy, True Blood and Philosophy, 30 Rock and Philosophy, and others. He has worked numerous times with William Irwin, General Editor of The Blackwell Philosophy and Pop Culture series through Wiley-Blackwell (publisher). In 2006 Arp edited the flagship book in that series, South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today, which has been translated into the Italian, the Turkish, and Portuguese. He also co-edited Batman and Philosophy: The Dark Knight of the Soul with Mark White, soon to be translated into the German language. Arp and White were interviewed in 2008 by The Boston Globe and, when asked by The Globe, \\"Do some scholars see this kind of thing (i.e., Philosophy and Popular Culture books) as silly?\\" part of Arp's response was: \\"At root we are trying to bring philosophy to people and bring people to philosophy.\\" Arp and White also contributed an article to The Globe called \\"Should Batman Kill the Joker?\\" in 2008. This article is reprinted in the eighth edition of The Norton Sampler: Short Essays for Composition (in Chapter 12: Argument), published by W. W. Norton & Company. Arp has also worked with Mark Conard and The Philosophy of Popular Culture series through The University Press of Kentucky, as well as with David Ramsay Steele and the Popular Culture and Philosophy series through Open Court Publishing Company, which has produced titles such as The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer, Star Wars and Philosophy, Star Trek and Philosophy, The Beatles and Philosophy, James Bond and Philosophy, and many others. One of Arp's latest projects is as editor of Tattoos ‚Äì Philosophy for Everyone: I Ink, Therefore I Am with Fritz Allhoff (General Editor of the Philosophy for Everyone series) and Wiley-Blackwell Publishers. Arp was Plenary Speaker for Pop Culture and Philosophy Conferences at Eastern Washington University (2010) and Georgia Southern University (2013). Arp's edited book, 1001 Ideas That Changed the Way We Think, was published through Simon & Schuster in 2013 and has sold thousands of copies worldwide in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Czechoslovakian. Concerning reviews of the book, The Boston Globe stated, \\"Editor Robert Arp has produced a reference guide that's fun to browse,\\" while Library Journal claims the book is \\"highly attractive... recommended\\" and Booklist notes that it is \\"entertaining and informative.\\" Of the nearly 50 ratings and 10 reviews of the book on Goodreads, 1001 Ideas has received a rating of 4.35 out of 5.0. In September 2015, Arp was interviewed by Ed Berliner on his show, The Hard Line with Ed Berliner, through Newsmax TV about South Park (season 19). On January 22, 2019, Arp appeared with other philosophers on the podcast devoted to philosophy and popular culture titled, I Think, Therefore I Fan.

They ride American made V-twin motorcycles such as Harley-Davidson's and wear a 3-piece back-patch similar to those worn by members of traditional outlaw motorcycle clubs. History The Tribe of Judah MM was founded in 1984 by Ben Priest. According to Priest's personal testimonyhttp://www.tribeofjudah.com/BenPriest.htm he was formerly addicted to illicit drugs and a member of an outlaw motorcycle club. In 1980 Priest underwent a conversion experience after attempting to commit suicide by drug overdose. Priest reports a personal encounter with Jesus Christ and details experiences which comply with what charismatic and pentecostal Christians would describe as Spirit baptism and the practice of speaking in tongues. Priest later formed the Tribe of Judah MM as a means to spread the Christian gospel amongst the biker community he had once been a part of. Membership There are currently 56 Tribe of Judah MM chapters in 19 US states and 9 further countries in Europe, Australia and North America.http://www.tribeofjudah.com/Chapters.htm Membership (full patch) of the Tribe of Judah MM is awarded following a hang around time, time of being a Millennium Messenger and a lengthy prospecting period, in some ways similar to that undergone by prospective members of an outlaw motorcycle club. In the Tribe of Judah full-patch members are considered to be ministers and the prospecting period is seen as a form of ministry training. Prior to becoming a prospect those wishing to join the Tribe of Judah MM are expected to spend some time as a Millennium Messenger, committing to support the ministry both in prayer and financially. Millennium Messengers & Harvest Partners Harvest Partners provide support for the Tribe of Judah in prayer and financially.http://www.tribeofjudah.com/Partnership.htm Millennium Messengers are also committed to provide support through prayer and finances to the Tribe of Judah MM. Additionally, Millennium Messengers may attend some outreaches and biker events, displaying a single-piece Millennium Messengers patch to show their support for the Tribe of Judah. Becoming a Millennium Messenger is also the first step involved in becoming a full member of the Tribe of Judah. Neither Harvest Partners or Millennium Messengers are required to own or ride a motorcycle. Patch Members of the Tribe of Judah wear a 3-piece patch, similar to those worn by members of traditional outlaw motorcycle clubs. The ToJMM patch differs from motorcycle club patches in a number of ways: #The Tribe of Judah wear an \\"MM\\" patch (which stands for Motorcycle Ministry) rather than the \\"MC\\" patch worn by members of an outlaw motorcycle club. #The Tribe of Judah are non-territorial and do not wear territory rockers or bars. The bottom rocker of the back-patch (where MC members traditionally wear a territory rocker) instead states \\"Jesus is Lord\\". The centre piece of the Tribe of Judah patch is the Christian cross. Tribe of Judah MM prospects wear only the bottom rocker of the back-patch Reception and Influence The Tribe of Judah MM have been a part of the international motorcycle community for over three decades and are considered by some to be an accepted and respected part of this society.http://www.rcvsmc.net/id19.html The freedom they have to wear their patches publicly at large motorcycle events and rallies, often socialising amongst members of established outlaw motorcycle clubs and one- percenter groups, could be argued to be highly indicative of this fact. Conversely, some members report to have received aggressive responses from others in the motorcycle community, perhaps indicating that this positive reception is not universal.

It was established in 2010 by Fred Malek and Norm Coleman as a 501(c)(4) organization. The American Action Network's sister organization, the American Action Forum, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization focusing on policy research. The American Action Forum is run by former Congressional Budget Office director Doug Holtz-Eakin. American Action Network officials also run the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC (independent expenditure PAC) focused on electing a House Republican majority. History and organization The American Action Network is an advocacy group, incorporated on July 23, 2009, and founded by Fred Malek, founder of Thayer Capital and former Republican National Committee deputy chairman. The organization says that it was founded to promote and support center right issues, conceived in part to counterbalance the liberal Center for American Progress. The organization calls itself an \\"action tank\\" or a \\"think-and-do- tank\\" and is classified as a 501(c)(4). Former Minnesota senator Norm Coleman was hired in 2010 as its chief executive officer. He now serves as chairman of the board of directors and also serves on the board of directors of the American Action Forum, a sister organization. In 2011, Brian Walsh, a former political director at the National Republican Congressional Committee, was hired as the group's president, replacing Rob Collins, the former chief of staff to Eric Cantor. Walsh would serve as President of American Action Network until January 2015. The organization's board members include Fred Malek, Vin Weber, Mel Martinez and Thomas M. Reynolds. In January 2015, then Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Mike Shields stepped down in his role with the Republican National Committee to become President of American Action Network. In December 2016, Corwin Albert \\"Corry\\" Bliss was announced as the new executive director of American Action Network. Funding and tax status Donations to the American Action Network are not tax-deductible as charitable contributions due to its 501(c)(4) status, and the organization is not required to disclose the source of donations. Tax records show the group raised nearly $27.5 million between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011, including one $7 million donation. Critics of the American Action Network have argued that the organization's advertisements contravene its requirements under its 501(c)(4) status. Malek has stated in response that such claims are \\"baseless\\". Related organizations The American Action Forum is a partner organization with the American Action Network, operating as a separate 501(c)(3) organization. The focus of the Action Forum is policy research. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, serves as its president. Members of the American Action Network also run the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC which was formed in October 2011 for the purpose of supporting Republican candidates in House races. The organization aims to maintain the Republican House majority. The group held an event in November 2011 that included appearances from Speaker of the House John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and representative Pete Sessions from Texas. Board members include Fred Malek, Norm Coleman, Brian Walsh and former representative Tom Reynolds In January 2011, the American Action Network created the Hispanic Leadership Network to bring more Hispanics to the Republican party. According to the organization's website, the Hispanic Leadership Network is a \\"sustained effort to engage the Hispanic Community on center right issues\\". Key members include executive director Jennifer Korn, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and former United States Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez. Activities According to the American Action Network website, the organization's purpose is to \\"create, encourage and promote center-right policies.\\" It aims to accomplish this through nationwide issue advocacy campaigns using print and television advertisements, direct mail, grassroots organizing, robocalls, online advertising and online videos. In May 2011 Campaigns and Elections reported that the American Action Network spent more than $25 million in the 2010 election cycle. According to USA Today the organization spent $17 million on issue advocacy and grassroots organizing and $5.5 million on candidates and political activities. In the 2010 elections the group funded political advertisements in 22 congressional districts nationwide including Colorado, Connecticut, South Dakota, Utah, Washington state and Wisconsin. In July 2012 Politico reported that the American Action Network planned to spend a minimum of $10 million to establish \\"a legislation-focused ground game in a number of states\\". The Politico article also called the American Action Network \\"one of the key outside forces on the right\\". In July 2013 Politico reported that the group has spent more than $750,000 in ad buys on promoting the Gang of Eight immigration bill S.744.http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/new-ad-for-immigration- reform-93802.html On November 10, 2015 the group ran an ad during a Republican debate, arguing that the newly established Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was \\"designed to interfere with your personal financial decisions\\", and called upon viewers to ask Congress to shut down the CFPB \\"before they deny you\\". The ad was criticized by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had advocated for the CFPB's creation and later served as its head before running for elected office. Senator Warren felt that it made her look like a \\"Commie dictator\\", and stated that \\"Thousands of dollars on a TV ad is nothing compared to the money the big banks save if their GOP buddies go after the CFPB.\\" On March 24, 2017 sports blog Deadspin reported that the group had been running local advertising in selected markets congratulating Republican members of Congress for helping pass a bill to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, despite the fact that the bill had been pulled earlier in the day by Speaker Paul Ryan due to dwindling support among Republicans. AAN stated to Deadspin that \\"Conservatives in and out of Congress continue to believe Obamacare has failed and will continue to fight for patient-centered reforms. Therefore, the claims in the ad remain true in spite of [these events].\\" On February 25, 2019 the group published the article The Green New Deal: Scope, Scale, and Implications,https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the- green-new-deal-scope-scale-and-implications/ showing detailed calculations estimating that the Green New Deal would cost at \\"least $50 trillion and possibly in excess of $90 trillion\\" by 2029. The article, however, did not consider any costs and damages resulting from inaction in tackling global warming and failed to discuss the proposal's crucial interconnections (e.g. those between guaranteed employment and housing or food security being guaranteed by said employment).

The researchers have also found evidence of a deep moat with the town wall. Remains of fire, the arrowheads and crossbow bolts tell of a violent struggle ca. 1270 and the many coins and other items suggest the residents left hurriedly. Stephan reported finding a broken roll of coins in the corner of one cellar and in other houses, sterling from Canterbury, pennies from Corvey and pfennige from Mecklenburg and Pomerania. Many of the houses had a furnace or foundry where the archaeologists found that large bronze bells, iron wheels, book clasps and jewelry had been cast, also metalsmiths where swords, lances, building hardware and nails were forged. The excavation also uncovered a brewery with a deep cellar and three wells. Initially, the archaeologists thought the residents abandoned the town because they had felled so many trees to fuel their forges and foundries and needed better access to more trees, but the researchers came to the conclusion that neither that nor the plague were the cause.

As the temperature there was at 21:00 local time on that day, it dropped to the next day, resulting in formation of surface crusts. During the daytime of January 17, the temperature rose up and the snow pack melted at the surface. In the late hours of that day, the snow pack's surface formed a melt-freeze crust by refreezing with the dropping temperature. Freshly precipitated snow in the night of January 17 and in the early hours of the next day covered the melt- crust surface.  Disaster  The avalanche flowed downwards at an average slope angle of 17 degrees, and struck the village at around 07:45 local time. The snow masses destroyed a total of 72 houses and buried more than 70 people and a great number of animals. The natural disaster caused the life losses of 59 people and 650 livestock. 21 people were injured at the incident.

The SEA was introduced in 2001, to replace the older Common Entrance exam. Subjects The SEA tests students on three areas, Language Arts, Mathematics and Creative Writing. Structure=Language Arts The Language Arts section of the exam is divided into three sections, testing respectively Grammar Skills, Vocabulary and Comprehension. Mathematics The Mathematics section of the exam is divided into three sections of general mathematics content, with the difficulty and value of the questions increasing with respect to section. For example section one is usually one(1) mark per question, section two(2) is two(2) or three(3) marks and section three(3) is four(4) marks Creative Writing In the Creative Writing section, students must choose to write either a story or a letter, from a small choice subject material. The themes chosen usually reflect some aspect of Caribbean life, such as picking fruit or apologizing to a neighbor for a broken window. Creative writing is assessed in grades four and five. In grade four students are to write factual passages and in grade five students are to write narrative descriptive passages  Preparation for the Exam Parents and Students both find preparing for this exam a difficult task, mainly due to the emphasis placed on passing for the First Choice school. Many students attend after-school Private Lessons. Leading towards the exam, most students will prepare via Practice Tests and Past Papers from previous years; these are usually sold by private organizations; Local newspapers also regularly offer free tests on set days. As of 2010, a free to use website has been available for all students within Trinidad and Tobago; pennacool.com offers exercises for 24 Topics in both Mathematics and Language Arts. Comparison to the Common Entrance Examinations The precursor to the SEA, the Common Entrance exam, was multiple choice and tested a wider range of subjects. English, Mathematics, Social Studies and Science were tested. Apart from a short Creative Writing Section at the end of the English section, the entire exam was multiple choice. Multiple choice was eliminated when the exams changed to the SEA, the idea being that a written exam would be more indicative of a child's education and competency.

Early life and career beginnings Ibrica Jusiƒá was born as Ibrahim Jusiƒá in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik into a family with seven children. His parents family originates from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina and he grew up listening to sevdalinka and Italian canzone music.. They were of Bosniak origin. Under the direction of his older brother ƒêelo Jusiƒá (born as ƒêevalhudin Jusiƒá), who was the leader of the group Dubrovaƒçki trubaduri (Dubrovnik Troubadours), Ibrica learned to play the guitar. He performed acoustical music and chansons all over Dubrovnik, before officially starting his professional career in 1965 in Zagreb, after being invited by composer Pero Gotovac. Career His song \\"Celuloidni pajac\\" (Celluloid Clown) was the winner of first place in the 1968 Zagreb Festival. He won the first prize at the same festival the following two years as well: in 1969 with the song \\"Osobenjak\\" (Eccentric) and in 1970 with the song \\"Maƒçka\\" (Cat.) Jusiƒá had a few more successful singles following the festival wins before moving to Paris, saying that he found Zagreb to be \\"too small.\\" He lived in Paris for three years and performed in cabarets, returning to Dubrovnik only during the summers, during which he held outdoors evening concerts on the steps of the Dominican Monastery. By using his summer travels to Dubrovnik he started to cooperate with Dubrovaƒçke ljetne igre (Dubrovnik Summer Festival) in 1971. With the songs of composer Pero Gotovac, he sang on several of the Festival shows, one of them being Miroslav Krle≈æa's Aretej. He composed music and sang in the show ≈Ωivotopis Miha Pracata (Biography of Miho Pracat) in 1977. In the same year he recited in the Kne≈æev dvor. In 1974, Jusiƒá became one of the first Yugoslav singers to record songs on an LP record on a record label Jugoton. He was one of the first persons who did solo- concert in Lisinski Theater in 1975. In next years he sang in almost all worldwide popular places, such as the Sydney Opera House, Carnegie Hall in New York City, the China Theatre in Stockholm. He composed music for works of writers and poets Luko Paljetak, Dobri≈°a Cesariƒá, Aleksa ≈†antiƒá, Mika Antiƒá, William Shakespeare, Bertolt Brecht and Drago Britviƒá, among others. Throughout the remaining years of the 1970s, he released several more singles, LP's and albums including Emina (1977), which featured his cover of the Bosnian sevdalinka Emina, written by poet Aleksa ≈†antiƒá in 1902. He released a self-titled symphony album, Ibrica, on 26 February 1981. Ibrica's older brother, maestro ƒêelo Jusiƒá, worked with him on the songs. The album was done in rich Mediterranean arrangements. It contained songs such as \\"≈†alom Sara\\" (Shalom Sara), \\"U svakom sluƒçaju te volim\\" (In Every Case, I Love You), \\"Na Stradunu\\" (On the Stradun) and others. Jusiƒá returned to France in 1980 upon receiving an invitation by the famous French show Le Grand √âchiquier. He got one more invitation from the same show on Christmas Eve, but this time, the guests also were stars like Charles Aznavour and the Gold Gate Quartet. Over the following two years, he was featured in the shows of the same producer. As a result of his experiences in Paris, he recorded a French-language album La vie (The Life) in 1985. He spent the second half of the 1980s living in Sweden, which inspired his 1988 album Hodaju ljudi (People Walk). He said it was a result of impact of his many years of residence in Sweden. Jusiƒá returned to Croatia in 1991, just as the Croatian War was beginning and Yugoslavia was breaking up. At the end of 1993, he wrote music for \\"Velika magija\\" (Great Magic) in the Gavella Drama Theatre, where he played and sang. His return to domestic waters resulted in retrospective compilation issued in Croatia Records in 1994. In 1997, he entered to the newly founded Dancing Bear record label and published a compact disc, Dan prije (The Day Before.) The material was recorded live at a concert held on 24 May 1997 in ZeKaeM. The CD's name comes from the fact that the day before his concert, in the same place, the ceiling collapsed. In 2001 he recorded Hazarder (A Tribute to Leonard Cohen) (Hustler), a tribute album, with twelve translations of poems of legendary Canadian chansonnier. Amanet (2003), contained all classic sevdalinka songs, which Ibrica Jusiƒá dedicated to the spiritual homeland and the country of his parents, Bosnia and Herzegovina, by recording the new, modern arrangements of a number of beautiful Bosnian sevdalinkas. In 2004, he became the first Croatian singer who was officially invited to Switzerland's Montreux Jazz Festival, one of the largest jazz festivals. That same year, he performed on Etno World Festival, Oslo. In 2008, he released Amanet 2, a follow-up to his 2003 sevdalinka album. It contained 13 original Bosnian sevdalinka songs recorded in the studio Liburnia Jazz Mozart, with the sounds of the accordion virtuoso Omar Pobrica and violin maestro Sasha Olenjuk. Jusiƒá marked his jubilee 45 years since the start of his career in 2009. Since his music has a mixture of Italian, French, Croatian and Bosnian influences, 2009 marked a number of concerts titled Od ≈†ekspira do sevdaha (From Shakespeare to Sevdah.)

History=1962-1973 The band was formed in ƒåaƒçak in the autumn of 1962 by Aleksandar Slavikoviƒá \\"Gu≈°ter\\" (guitar), Ljubodrag Jovanoviƒá (bass guitar), Zoran Sokiƒá (keyboards), Mi≈°o Iliƒá (rhythm guitar), Dragan Maksimoviƒá (drums), Slobodan Pajiƒá (vocals) and Muhamed Hukiƒá (vocals). During 1963, the band started to perform in their most successful lineup which featured Slavikoviƒá, Pajiƒá, Hukiƒá, Sokiƒá (who switched to bass guitar), Stevo Radoviƒá (rhythm guitar) and Predrag Radonjiƒá (drums). With the arrival of composer Radoviƒá, the band started working on their own songs. On the first Belgrade Gitarijada festival, held on 9 January 1966, the band performed first, starting their performance with a cover of the folk song \\"Crne oƒçi, curo, ima≈°\\". On Gitarijada the band won the seventh place, which made possible for them to perform at bigger concerts. In the autumn of 1966, due to their leaving to studies, Sokiƒá and Pajiƒá left the band. During 1966 the band performed the song \\"Plavokosa\\" which saw success with the audience. Several years later the song was, under the title \\"Plavu≈°a\\", recorded by Kiƒáo Slabinac (who served the army with Radoviƒá in Titograd), who achieved nationwide popularity with it. With the new bass guitarist, Miki Vukadinoviƒá, Bele Vi≈°nje performed on the second Belgrade Gitarijada festival, held on 23 January 1967. The band performed a cover of the Bosnian folk song \\"Moj dilbere\\" and the song \\"Tango\\" and won the third place.

Reunions The band reunited in 1990. The lineup featured Vladimir ≈†unjareviƒá, Stevo Radoviƒá, Predrag Radonjiƒá, Slobodan Pajiƒá and Jovan Matija≈°eviƒá. As there were no recordings of the band's songs from the 1960s, in 1994 the band, on the initiative of Radomir Mihajloviƒá Toƒçak, recorded their old songs, released on the audio cassette Pesme na≈°e mladosti (Songs of Our Youth) by Zvuci Galaksije.

She obtained her BA at the University of Cambridge in Akkadian, Hebrew and Persian. Her tutor was Joan Oates, a noted Mesopotamian archaeologist. After graduation, she returned to Baghdad, where she began working in the National Museum of Iraq. Along with her cousin Lamya Gailani, they were the first women in Iraq to go on archaeological excavations as representatives of the archaeological service. One of her first assignments was to accompany the team led by David Oates (the husband of her tutor), which discovered a large cache of the celebrated Nimrud Ivories, many of which were restored by Selma, giving her a first taste of restoration. She then obtained her master's degree in Art History and Archeology at Columbia University in New York in 1967 under the tutelage of Edith Porada. On her return, she continued to work in the Department of Antiquities and the Museum. The family left Iraq to settle in Beirut, where Selma began teaching at the American University of Beirut (1969‚Äì1974). She enrolled in the University of Amsterdam for her PhD degree. Her supervisors were Maurits van Loon from Amsterdam and Edith Porada from Columbia University. The University of Amsterdam did not require students to be resident for their graduate degrees after all their courses were completed. Her PhD research was performed on a Bronze Age site in Cyprus, Phlamoudhi Vounari, and her thesis was published in 1983.Al-Radi, Selma. \\"Phlamoudhi Vounari: A Sanctuary Site in Cyprus\\", Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology, vol. LXV, Goteborg. In 1977, she took on the position of an adviser to the National Museum of Yemen in Sana'a, and Yemen was to remain the focus of most of her work. There, she conducted many archaeological surveys, participated in digs, energized the field of restoration of buildings especially mud brick palaces in the Hadhramawt. But her chef d'oeuvre was to be the restoration of the Amiriya Madrasa, probably not a madrassa (school) but rather a large palace with a beautiful small mosque. In collaboration with the Antiquites Department led by Qadi Ismail Al-Aqwa', she began in 1983 to restore the structure of this massive building which was about to fall down. Using local craftsmen whose expertise was handed down in the same families for generations, she resuscitated the ancient medieval craft of building in Yemen. In particular, she re-invented the ancient plastering method of qudad, a waterproofing cement similar in many ways to ancient Roman pozzolana. After laborious experimentation, they discovered the correct mixtures of volcanic ash and slaked lime. The results were published in 1995.Selma Al-Radi, 1995 The Amiriya Madrasa in Rada', Yemen (Oxford University Press) The large cadre of masons and qudad workers became a school of restoration after the project gained international attention. Many of the workers were hired to restore old mansions in Yemen or to use the same methods to build new ones there. She was a tireless campaigner for raising funds for the building restoration from the Dutch and Yemeni governments. When the structure was stabilized, she turned her attention to the beautifully painted mosque. The sanctuary was painted with murals in colorful designs, part of a long tradition of painted wooden and plaster ceilings in Yemen from the early medieval period on. Selma had documented the existence of these painted mosques, a unique feature in Islamic architecture, and Yemen was particularly rich in these structures. Selma documented as many as 40 of these mosques. A five-year project began with the Centro di Conservazione Archaeologica in Rome led by Roberto Nardi to conserve and restore the paintings. Students were involved in the training. Selma herself cleaned the intricately carved stucco decoration which had been covered with decades of whitewash using fine dental tools. The result was magnificent. Another book followed with emphasis on restoration of the stucco and paintings.2005 AMIRIYA MADRASA: The Conservation of the Mural Paintings. Selma Al-Radi Roberto Nardi Chiara Zizola. Centro di Conservazione Archeologica, S.r.l. The New York Times described the project as \\"an immense undertaking\\" and the madrasa as \\"one of the great treasures of Islamic art and architecture.\\" Awards In 2005 Al-Radi received the Yemen Presidential Medal of Culture. In 2007. In 2007, Al-Radi and Yahya Al-Nasiri received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for their work in the restoration.\\"2007 Cycle Awards Recipients\\" \\"The Aga Khan Development Network\\" Family Al-Radi was the sister of Nuha al-Radi, the author of Baghdad Diaries.Nuha Al-Radi, Baghdad Diaries Vintage Books 1998\\" Al-Radi was married to Qais Al-Awqati, a Professor of Medicine and Physiology at Columbia University.

This makes him a perfect foil for Rong Qiqi, who rejects his personal responsibilities in favour of pursuing happiness. In the story, Confucius encounters Rong Qiqi, an elderly recluse who has chosen a life of asceticism. Rong is starkly in contrast to the Confucian ideal of a successful man; he is elderly, poorly dressed, with little material possessions or ambitions. And yet, despite his poverty, Rong appears happy to Confucius. He responds to Confucius' bewilderment with a cheerful song, happily accompanied by his playing of what may be translated as \\"lute\\" (but was actually the qin). The Han Dynasty classic Huainanzi reports that \\"when Rong Qiqi plucks one chord of his lute, Confucius, moved by its harmony, rejoiced for three days.\\"Spiro, Audrey.(1990), p. 62. Confucius requests Rong provide reasons for his happiness. Rong Qiqi, Confucius surmised, has nothing to be joyful of; he has no possessions, no hope, and no future. Rong replies that he is happy for three reasons, his \\"three joys\\" (): being born human, being born a man, and living to an old age. That, for him, is enough. After all, Rong surmises, most men are poor and all men will die, so why should he worry himself? This is consistent with all lives, so instead of waiting with everyone else for it to eventually end, why should he worry himself with anything? Why should he deny himself happiness? Instead of being miserable, waiting for his fate, he chooses to be happy.Robinet, Isabelle.(1979). Says Rong Qiqi: Appeal Rong Qiqi's appeal was his complete abstinence of material desires. He was similar to his Western counterpart, Diogenes the Cynic, in rejecting all societal norms and physical comforts for a life of ascetic virtue. He lived in poverty, not because he was forced to, but because he chose to. He chose to reject the material world. Being destitute was, by itself, not an appealing trait. In literature and art The philosophy of the possibly fictional Rong Qiqi was widely admired among writers, with artists viewing it at as a more natural, more fluid, more liberating way to live life. The poet Ruan Kan wrote approvingly of Rong, applauding Rong Qiqi's fatalistic view of life as a way to achieve the tranquility and harmony valued in Daoism as integral to the Dao.Yao & Gu (1982) Poets Gu Kaizhi and Tao Yuanming both mentioned Rong Qiqi in their poetry. Tao spoke of Rong with some skepticism, wondering if such emphasis on nature and abandonment of the worldly is actually worth it.Spiro, Audrey.(1990), p. 94. In fact, in the second of his \\"Drinking Wine\\" series of poems, Tao Yuanming questions what is the worth of living a virtuous life, if this means having to choose poverty, in order to do so? Tao uses the examples of Boyi and Shuqi (who starved to death for their ideals) and of Rong Qiqi; mentioning in this poem, that in his ninetieth decade of life, Rong was using a mere rope for a belt. Tao answers his own question: Were it not for those individuals who chose poverty so as to preserve their integrity, What in history would be worth passing down to future generations?Yeh Chia-ying, translation Josey Shun and Bhikshuni Heng Yin, \\"Lectures on Tao Yuanming's Poems\\", a series of lectures at Gold Buddha Monastery, Canada (lecture tapes were transcribed by Tu Xiaoli, An Yi, and Yang Aidi) <\\"Vajra Bhodi Sea\\" No.370, March 2001>, et sub Some poets rejected Rong, seeing seclusion as a cheap escape from recent misfortune and responsibility. The poet Sengdu, while praising the idea of seclusion as a means of spiritual enlightenment, rejected Rong's reaction to futility by indulging in simplistic joys and desire. As he describes in one of his poems, Sendu's response to Rong is \\"Though this age might be said to be joyous, what of later lives?\\"Bokenkamp, Stephen.(2009), p. 29-30. Rong Qiqi was also popularly associated with a group of Chinese Taoist Qingtan scholars, writers, and musicians called the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove who came together in the 3rd century CE. This is indicated in some apocryphal art from the 4th century CE, in a tomb near Nanjing, depicting Rong Qiqi with the Seven Sages.Spiro, Audrey.(1990) However, the Seven Sages lived in a time period long after Rong Qiqi's, so this association apocryphally assumes that Rong Qiqi as a real person.

The group earned four Top 20 hits in Belgium in 1984 and 1985, before disbanding in 1986 due to Nebel's death. Career Patrick Nebel was born Patrick Marina Schools on 23 November 1958 in Merksem and formed the band in the early 1980s. The name was a pun on Nacht und Nebel (German: \\"Night and Fog\\") ‚Äì the directive designed by Adolf Hitler which resulted in the kidnapping and forced disappearance of most enemies of the Third Reich. After releasing a 4-track EP Alcatraz in 1981, the band debuted with the album Casablanca in 1982, which met with good reviews but not a commercial success. The band's next album, Beats of Love, was released in 1983 to positive reviews and featured the eponymous track that was to become their biggest hit. The single \\"Beats of Love\\" reached the Top 3 in Belgium in 1984 and sold 150,000 copies in Belgium and France. Their next single, \\"√âtoile du Nord\\", was a Top 20 hit in Belgium. It was followed by \\"Table for Two\\", a single credited to Patrick Nebel solo, which was only a moderate success. Nacht und Nebel's third and final studio album, Victoria 2000, was released in 1985. It featured the singles \\"Ready to Dance\\" and \\"Victoria 2000\\" which peaked in the local chart at no. 14 and 12 respectively. Both songs did prove to be a larger success in the clubs. Nebel was greatly overweight and was treated in a Swiss sanatorium. He was also addicted to alcohol and prescription drugs, and suffered from heart disease. That combination proved fatal and on 15 March 1986 Patrick Nebel died in Ekeren. The band subsequently dissolved, but released a compilation in 1986, Songs for Ever.

Early life Kirkland C. Barker was born September 8, 1819 in Schuyler, New York, the son of builder and contractor Mason Barker and his wife Elizabeth Ingham Barker. Kirkland was educated in the local schools, at age 14 attended a manual labor school in Whitesboro, New York, where he traded his labor for an education. After leaving school, he worked as a store clerk in Frankfort, New York and Utica, New York. At age 18, he moved to Cleveland, Ohio and worked in a warehouse. There, his ability at business was recognized by his employers, and he was frequently put in charge of ships bringing goods from New York. Leaving the warehouse, Barker took a job as a travelling salesman for a tobacco company in Logansport, Indiana, but himself lived in Detroit. Barker was determined to go into business for himself, and so established a partnership with other people in Utica, and built stores in Detroit and New York, and a factory in Jersey City, New Jersey. This partnership was not successful, so Barker started anew by himself, opening KC Barker & Company (later the American Eagle Tobacco Company) in Detroit. This new firm prospered.

The library system was originally known as the Nelsonville Public Library. The original facility in Nelsonville was created in 1935 as an outgrowth of the Nelsonville school system. The library system has an inventory of about 300,000 items. In recent years, it has provided computers with Internet connections at its libraries, and this service has been shown to be very popular. Recently, the library system has begun a landscaping program at its libraries to introduce a wider variety of plantings, especially including native trees and shrubs. History Before the establishment of the county library the Works Progress Administration maintained twenty library stations throughout the county. These libraries usually consisted of small collections and untrained staff, but demonstrated a need in the county for a dedicated public library. On June 1, 1935 the idea for a public library was conceived under the name The Public Library for the City of Nelsonville and Athens County. Staff from the WPA were the first librarians and various organizations and townspeople donated books to first fill the shelves. In September 1935 around a thousand books were borrowed from the State Traveling library and in December $200 donated from the State Aid for Libraries fund. Still spread across multiple WPA libraries, the entire collection moved to Washington street in 1936 allowing the hiring of a trained librarian, and the cataloging of the books under one roof. By 1939 the library moved again and began converting the old library stations (now unused) into branch libraries. By the end of 1939 the system consisted of one library with two branches and five deposit stations. A bookmobile was also started with county budget funds which visited the county schools. In 1940 the Athens branch opened in a part of the city previously serviced by the University system. During the 1970s through 1990s an addition three library branches were opened throughout Athens. These were the Wells library, the Coolville library, and The Plains library. With their inclusion the size of the system grew to its current seven branches. Starting in 2013 the library system successfully received $17,400 in funding to begin offering bikes for student use. The program, \\"Book-a-Bike\\" allows students with a library card an alternative to taking the bus or walking to school.

Located in the center of the city, it was constructed long before Hilliard's rapid growth of the twentieth-century. It has been named a historic site. Hilliard's Odd Fellows built the present hall in 1883. At the time, Hilliard was just a small farming community, radically different from its present condition as a city within the Columbus metropolitan area. Typical of small commercial structures erected at the time, the hall is a simple Italianate building. It is one of just two nineteenth- century brick commercial buildings in the city that survive in anything close to their original condition.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 479. Built of brick on a foundation of limestone, the hall is covered with a metal roof, and it features exterior elements of brick and wood. Two stories tall, it features a cornice with paired brackets at the base of the roof. The design takes advantage of the building's location at a street corner: although the first- story windows and entrances are concentrated on one side, both street sides are divided into four bays with four tall arched windows on the second story., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-02-25. Inside, the first story is divided into a pair of shop spaces, while the Odd Fellows' second-story meeting room has experienced minimal modification. Still remaining are the original hoodmolds over the doors and windows, wainscoting, wooden floor, lights, and ornamental metalwork covering the ceiling. On May 6, 1988, the Odd Fellows Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. On the same day, the National Park Service gave the same designation to three other Hilliard buildings, the Hilliard United Methodist Church, the Dr. James Merryman House, and the Winterringer Building and House.

The organization was founded in 1977 by Jean-Jacques Gautier under the name Swiss Committee against Torture. APT believes that prevention of torture is best achieved through three integrated elements: effective monitoring; legal and policy frameworks; and ensuring determination and capability on the part of international and national actors.  Founder Biography  Jean Jacques Gautier was born in 1912 in Chene-Bourgeries, Geneva. He was raised by a family of influential bankers and he later became an associate of the Picet and Cie private bank. In 1973, Amnesty International started a campaign to abolish the practices of torture. This influenced Gautier because he believed that torture was, \\"the absolute weapon in the service of the powers of the evil, the shame of our century.\\" Being greatly influenced by his Christian beliefs and the anti torture movement, Gautier entered early retirement and dedicated the remainder of his life to stopping torture from endangering the lives of innocent people. Activities The APT pursues its goals through four broad categories of activities.  Develop legal instruments  APT offers legal advice and is involved in the drafting of legal instruments to prevent torture. APT has contributed to the UN Convention Against Torture and its Optional Protocol (OPCAT); the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and the Robben Island Guidelines for the Prohibition and Prevention of Torture in Africa.  Advocate for preventive mechanisms  APT engages in direct advocacy at several levels.  Strengthen capacities  APT works with national, regional, and international partners to strengthen their capacity to prevent torture. APT advises on specific techniques for implementing monitoring, training in legal issues, and legislative reform.  Produce practical tools  APT develops materials and publishes various resources.  Achievements  The Association for the Prevention of Torture has worked for over 40 years to prevent torture around the world. There are now regional, national and international committees that oversee places of detention in which people are being denied of their civil liberties. A common term for these detention centers are closed environments which are prisons or immigration centers that prevent people from expressing their inalienable rights. The APT has taken preventative measures to ensure that individuals who have been incarcerated or taken into custody unjustly are able to have access to a lawyer, a doctor and family members are also notified when their relatives are incarcerated to prevent and reduce the possibility of torture occurring. The APT has also been successful in setting up regular visits to detention camps and ensuring that no malpractices are occurring among people who are being detained. Additionally, the APT has also composed a guide about anti torture legislation that details the national laws that must be followed to take action against torturous acts. Since the APT partnered with the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture (OPCAT) many places of detention have been shut down. Also, in other instances the living conditions of some detention camps have improved in terms of food and housing arrangements. These improvements are due to the communicative efforts between national organizations and the APT.  Regional Expansion  The APT works with countries in Africa, the Americas, Pacific Asia, Europe and Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa and other countries to carry out plans for preventing acts of torture. Indonesia organized a trip for students to visit Geneva with the help of the APT and they spent the day at a workshop to develop strategies to create a system that monitors the conditions of a detention camp. The APT hopes that its support for Indonesian national institutions will form the National Preventive Mechanism in Indonesia which is the process of ratifying OPCAT to act as a supporting system in efforts to rid any areas of Indonesia that are engaging in cruel acts of torture.  Structure and Partnerships  The APT Board is elected annually by the APT General Assembly and is composed of 16 experts from 10 countries. The full Board meets twice a year to approve the strategic plan and budget for the coming year and to review activities from the previous period. Some members of the board are involved more frequently in supervising, advising, or participating in APT activities. The APT has consultative status the following organizations: * United Nations Economic and Social Council * Organisation of American States * Council of Europe * African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights * Organisation internationale de la Francophonie The APT is a member of: * Swiss Coalition for the International Criminal Court * The Coalition of International NGOs Against Torture (CINAT) * The International Detention Coalition APT has been recognized with the following awards: * Human Rights Prize of the French Republic, 2004 * Prize of the Foundation for Geneva, 2004 * Chico Mendes Resistance Prize, 2007  Purpose  The APT is a non governmental association that is focused on ensuring that no human being is ever subjected to the cruel or inhumane practices of torture. The vision of the APT is to protect the liberties of people who have been denied or cheated out of their basic human rights. Every person is entitled to being treated with respect and given opportunities to better themselves and their economic status. The APT is also very objective in its pursuits which are to have an open mind and non discriminatory ideal towards helping any one who is being treated unjustly. Overall, the APT has set an international standard by which over 80 countries are in agreement to recognize that torture is an inhumane act that affects people in developing countries. The APT has ongoing projects in place to ensure that acts of torture are not legitimized in any form.

The wide-ranging public presentations seen at the building included boxing matches, musical concerts, political lectures, farm shows, and high school dances. The building was used for storage from 1939 until 2000. The building was purchased in 2000 by the Stanwood Area Historical Society when it was found to be in a heavily deteriorated state.

His work is highly influenced by Pop art and exhales the artist‚Äôs sense of humour, constituting a playful corpus of life-size wooden figures, colourful paintings with inserted strings, and evocative collages of photographs and drawings. He founded the artistic group Unknown Genius (Miskende geni√´n)in his youth. His persona is polemical since already in 1969 he went on a trial for the scandal that his piece \\"Twenty penis\\" created; in 1976 the artist remained by mistake 22 days in jail and the sequel appeared in 1999 when he executed the piece \\"Groeten uit Sint- Gillis\\" (1999) evocating his stay in jail.

On the death of his father he was taken under the protection of the Count of Ferrara, who took him to Mantua, where he was so struck with the works of Giulio Romano that he applied himself with great diligence to studying and copying them. On his return to his native country he gave convincing proof of the advantage his travels and study had been to him in several pictures he painted for the churches and convents of the different towns in Switzerland. He painted some pastoral subjects in fresco on the ceiling of the concert-room at Zurich. His historical pictures are well composed, correctly drawn, and vigorously coloured. He also painted some battle-pieces, which were much admired. He died in 1729.

It is the only species in the genus Circellium. The loss of flight allows the beetle to use the empty space below the elytra as a carbon dioxide storage tank, creating a unique breathing mechanism which conserves water, a valuable survival trait in the arid regions it lives in. Flightless Dung Beetle rolling a ball of dung The species was originally widespread in Southern Africa, but it only survives in the few areas mentioned above; as such, it qualifies as an IUCN vulnerable species. Its vulnerability is exacerbated by a number of other factors, including the fact that its habitat is under threat by agriculture and human activity, that it has low breeding capacity as well as low dispersability (as a consequence of being flightless), and that its survival is strictly dependent on a number of vertebrates (particularly elephant and buffalo) that are also experiencing a decrease in population. The flightless dung beetles mostly feed on elephant or buffalo faeces, but they have been recorded to also feed on dung from other species such as rabbits, baboons, antelopes, and ostriches.

The fort was built as part of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system of fortifications, which were conceived in response to the increasing power and range of artillery. The Fort de Bourl√©mont was part of the defenses of the Charmes Gap (Trou√©e de Charmes), in the town of Mont-l√®s-Neufch√¢teau, west of Neufch√¢teau. Description The diamond-shaped fort was entered over a drawbridge through an off-center gate complex, directly adjacent to one of the caponiers that defend the fort's ditch. The for has a double caponier at the diamond's apex, with single caponiers, including the entrance caponier, and opposite corners. The artillery batteries are disposed in a rough circle surrounding the central barracks. The firing positions are shielded by earth mounds, while the entire surface of the fort incorporates earth protection against shellfire. The fort is unique in possessing, from its construction, a dedicated infirmary. Built of earth-shielded masonry, the fort could resist attacks by black powder- filled artillery shells. With the development of high explosive-filled shells, the so-called crise des obus torpilles (\\"crisis of the torpedo [explosive] shells\\"), the fort was obsolete without further reinforcement with concrete. The Fort de Bourl√©mont never received such an upgrade. The fort, planned to play a major role in the defense of the area is a fort d'arr√™t (\\"stop point\\" or \\"stopping fort\\") designed to close the Charmes Gap between the defensive curtains of Epinal-Belfort and Toul-Verdun. Its artillery fire was planned to cover: * The retreat of French field formations in case they were compelled to evacuate the wooded hills of Mirecourt * The transportation hub of Neufch√¢teau, a location of exceptional importance with four train lines and five main roads * The valley of the Sa√¥nelle * The Midrevaux valley The fort was also planned to interdict enemy troops seeking to gain access to the Paris basin. The fort was designed to operate for three months with complete autonomy. Artillery faces in all directions. There is no lightly defended \\"rear\\" to the fort. The barracks are placed in sunken \\"streets\\" in the center, which, while effective against the artillery of the time, was insufficient for protection against high-explosive shells. As a fort d'arr√™t, the fort's role was to provide a strategic rallying point where an invading enemy, funneled by the Epinal-Belfort and Toul-Verdun defensive curtains, could be decisively engaged and defeated by a field army on prepared terrain of France's choosing. The fort covers , including the ditches. The fort includes 84 rooms and shelters in 91 locations. The fort was planned for: * 732 men, with 690 enlisted men, 33 non-commissioned officers and 9 officers * Five horses * A nominal armament upon completion of 18 artillery pieces on the rampart of 120mm and 155mm caliber * 8 defensive artillery pieces * 11 mortars * 150000 kg of black powder in cartridges and 985,000 balls or shells  History  The preferred site was chosen in 1877 by a committee that included General Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, and was expropriated from landowners that included the Prince H√©nin. Construction began in 1878, with an approximate budget of 2 million francs-d'or. Construction was by Petit et Marey of Neufch√¢teau. Stone was quarried locally at Fr√©ville and Rapailles, conveyed to the construction site by a railway line whose vestiges remain visible. An 1880 project to install a Mougin casemate never came to fruition. The fort was away from the fighting during the First World War. During the Second World War the Germans used the fort as a depot. An explosion caused numerous German casualties. The Germans stripped the fort of armament and metals between 1941 and 1944. * From 1881 to 1914 : Installation of a reduced garrison at the fort as a detachment of the 79th Artillery Regiment, armament of the fort. * From 1914 to 1918 : Re-armament of the fort as a result of World War I. * From 1918 : Occupied by American troops, the fort became a detention site for German and Alsatian prisoners of war. * From 1918 to 1939 : The fort became a munitions depot with a small garrison. * From 1940 : The fort is occupied by German troops who use it as a munitions and materi√®l depot. * From 1945 to 1950 : A small guard post is set up in the former officer's quarters outside the fort. * From 1950 to 1996 : The fort is abandoned, but the surrounding lands remain military territory. Troops use the fort several times a year for exercises. In 1996 Mont-l√®s-Neufch√¢teau bought the fort. The fort has been managed by the Association des Amis du Fort de Bourl√©mont (AAFB) since 1997, which provides tours of the site. The site has been cleared, with the fort largely intact, although missing a portion of a wall and a caponier.

The pieces were created in 1970, and have formed part of several exhibitions of contemporary art in museums around the world, most recently in the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego, United States. On each occasion, the pair have been displayed together as a combined installation. Description The pieces are displayed in a specially constructed octagonal chamber. The floor, ceiling and every wall are painted in a deep burgundy and are carefully and evenly lit. Stuck Red and Stuck Blue are placed on two of the longer walls, which are separated by a shorter \\"corner\\" wall. The pieces each consist of a recess cut into one of the walls, each equidistant from the adjoining corner. Inside of each recess is a coloured fluorescent light (red in Stuck Red, blue in Stuck Blue). The lights are not visible directly, but they illuminate exactly the space cut from the wall, with no spillage. The walls of the recesses are painted white, but by reflecting the light from the fluorescent lamps appear to be different colours. The overall effect of the two pieces is to engender an optical illusion in which the three-dimensional space of the installation appears to collapse into two dimensions - the apertures seem to alternate between their actual \\"void\\" form and being on a single plane with the surrounding walls, ceiling and floor.Davies, Hugh M; Onorato, Ronald J; Blurring the Boundaries: Installation Art 1969-1996, Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego (1997). . p. 14.Davies, pp. 74-75. Background Much of Turrell's work is dedicated to the exploration of the aesthetic properties and \\"thingness\\" of light, drawing inspiration from sources as wide-ranging as the works of the perceptual phenomenologist Merleau Ponty (with whom Turrell became familiar through his background in psychology) to those of artists such as Claude Monet and Mark Rothko.Benjamin, Andrew; Installation Art, John Wiley & Sons (1995). . p. 47. Stuck Red and Stuck Blue were assembled as early as 1970, while Turrell was working in a studio in Mendota, California, but he did not publicly exhibit the work until 1989.Adcock, Craig; James Turrell: The Art of Light, University of California Press (December 20, 1990). . p. 147 The debut of the two pieces took place at the Ace Gallery in Los Angeles, California.Adcock, p. 148. In 1990, the works were reinstalled at the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego, purchased with funds from the Elizabeth W. Russell Foundation.

Retrieved 15 October 2010. Each installation of the pieces required significant preparatory work by Turrell, who used a combination of diagrams and scale models, as well as extensive on-site experimentation, to determine the correct proportions and layout for the chambers.

History The name Hardley means \\"hard clearing\\", presumably in relation to the soft marshlands which surround the area.Hardley, Old Hampshire Gazetteer Hardley is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, when it was considered part of the New Forest. It is mentioned again in the 14th century, when William Chippe held lands there.Victoria County History, (1912), A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5, Fawley In the 16th century the estate assumed the title of a manor in the hands of William Buckett, who held it from at least 1531 to 1579. After this it changed hands rapidly until finally conveyed to Richard Pittis, attorney of the King's Bench in 1628. There is no further trace of Hardley as a separate manor, but lands there were among the possessions of the Stanleys of the Paultons estate in 1693, 1745, and 1781. A curious incident occurred in the 16th century when Thomas Tracie held the lease of Hardley Farm from William Buckett. Peter Kembridge and a man named Oglander wishing to rob Tracie of some of his possessions, arrested him, Oglander impersonating the sheriff's bailiff. Carried by force to an alehouse at Dibden, Tracie, who describes himself as \\"a poor plain simple creature,\\" was compelled \\"to seal and deliver certain writings, but to what effect he himself knoweth not.\\" Tracie's wife meanwhile followed her husband, and \\"made moan\\" for him outside the chamber.

She sailed in the San Francisco trade, in the Far East, and transported whaling products from Hawaii and the Arctic to New Bedford. San Francisco trade and transport of whaling products Sailing card Syren sailed in the San Francisco trade from Boston and New York City from 1851 to 1856, making five passages. She then made a voyage from Boston and Calcutta, and served in the Boston - Honolulu - New Bedford trade until 1861. She then made four more passages in the San Francisco trade. In 1866, Syren returned to the Boston - Honolulu - New Bedford run, a route she sailed for ten more years. In 1877, Syren began to voyage to Alaska and the Arctic to transport whale oil and the catch of whalers; she also transported coal to the north, and a load of spars from Seattle to Bath, ME. In All About Hawaii, written in 1920, there appears the following note about Syren: > Dec. 23, 1858, ship Syren, 1064 tons, Green master, 96 days from Boston via > Rio Janeiro, with cargo for this market. Feb. 23, 1860, she is back with > another eastern cargo, reporting a trip of 114 days. Was the crack ship of > the Brewer line of Boston packets several years. In 1868 she made the run in > 105 days, and in 1872 it was 109. She also figured in the San Francisco- > China trade later, and was finally condemned at Rio, July, 1888. Fast voyage from San Francisco to Boston, 1861 In 1861, Syren made a fast voyage from San Francisco to Boston of 103 days, besting the Kingfisher by 17 days. On this voyage, Syren also bested four other clippers bound for New York: Northern Light and Belle of the Seas, both by three days, and Sierra Nevada and Mary Robinson, both by 4 days. Far East voyages and guano trade Other ports of call during Syren's long career included: in the Far East, Manila, Whampoa and Batavia; Baker Island, Liverpool, and London. The stop at Baker Island suggests that she was engaged in the guano trade. Another fast voyage was an 1857 round trip between Boston and Calcutta, of 99 days to Calcutta and 97 days returning. However, Syren was not known as a particularly fast ship on the East Coast to San Francisco run, as she seemed to run into more than her share of calms, light winds, and bad weather off Cape Horn. Her times typically ranged from 120 to 152 days. Mishaps Syren suffered various mishaps during her long career, but remained in service nonetheless. On April 25, 1861, Syren was beating out of San Francisco, near the entrance to the Golden Gate, when she struck Mile Rock two times. Syren made it back into the harbor with four feet of water in her hold. She was nearly sinking by the time she was beached on the mud flats. Repairs at Mare Island Navy Yard cost $15,000. Like many clippers, Syren lost rigging and topgallant masts off Cape Horn and in the South Atlantic, in 1853, 1856, 1858 and 1864. An unknown vessel collided with Syren on a voyage from Boston to Honolulu on December 18, 1870, near the equator in the Atlantic Ocean, but Syren did not sustain serious damage.

It was a clandestine organisation except during the Progressive Biennium (1854‚Äì1856). In the 1840s, the parliamentary conservatives of the Moderate Party were in power, to the exclusion of the liberals of the centre- left Progressive Party. The Progressive Party's left-wing grew increasingly critical of the Isabelline Monarchy's political regime, feeling the parliamentary system to be stacked against them. They began to demand a root- and-branch institutional reform, particularly the replacement of electoral property requirements with universal manhood suffrage, and the replacement of the sovereignty of the monarch with the principle of popular national sovereignty. In this climate the Revolutions of 1848 broke out across Europe, and the Radical wing of the Progressive Party was particularly impressed by the revolution in France that brought about the Second Republic. These examples pushed the Progressives' left-wing to adopt more hardline political demands incompatible with the existing constitutional monarchy, such as republicanism. In 1849, the left-wing of the progressives broke off to form the Democratic Progressive Party, which they considered to be the true heir to Spain's radical and Jacobin liberal tradition. The new party represented an alliance of radical liberals (see Radicalism) and moderate socialists (see utopian socialism). Led by Francisco Pi y Margall and Cristino Martos, the Democrats called for an end to the conservative parliamentary monarchy of Queen Isabella, and the full application of the Constitution of 1812. Following the Glorious Revolution of 1868, which deposed Queen Isabella, the party disintegrated due to conflicts between its different factions. * The cimbrios faction accepted the replacement of the conservative parliamentary monarchy of Isabel II with a more ceremonial monarchy under Amadeo I; known as the cimbrios, they merged with the Radical Democratic Party of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla. * The federalist faction, led by party leader Pi i Margall, rejected the monarchy entirely, calling for a democratic republic. They sought cooperation with incipient Spanish labour movement and the Catalan independentists, and went on to form the Federal Republican Party.

Rear view Detail of pin-head The Hunterston Brooch is a highly important Celtic brooch of \\"pseudo-penannular\\" type found near Hunterston, North Ayrshire, Scotland, in either, according to one account, 1826 by two men from West Kilbride, who were digging drains at the foot of Goldenberry Hill,Lamb, page 92 or in 1830.Youngs, 92 It is now in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh. Made within a few decades of 700 AD,NMS the Hunterston Brooch is cast in silver, gilt, and set with pieces of amber (most now missing), and decorated with interlaced animal bodies in gold filigree. The diameter of the ring is 12.2 cm, and in its centre there is a cross and a golden Glory representing the Risen Christ, surrounded by tiny bird heads. The pin, which is broken, can travel freely around the ring as far as the terminals, which was necessary for fastening; it is now 13.1 cm long, but was probably originally 15 cm or more.Youngs, 91 The brooch may have been made at a royal site, such as Dunadd in Argyll, though is more likely to have been made in Ireland, especially as its pseudo-penannular form is typical of Irish brooches, whereas the truly penannular form remained usual in Pictish brooches. On the other hand, its style is closely comparable to a terminal fragment of a penannular brooch found in Dunbeath in 1860 which probably was made in Scotland; craftsmen may have travelled across the area using the locally popular forms.Youngs, 57 Lloyd and Jennifer Laing feel it was probably made in Dalriada, and the Museum of Scotland say \\"The style of the brooch has Irish parallels, while the filigree resembles metalwork from England. The brooch was probably made in western Scotland where the two traditions were joined, or perhaps in Ireland by a craftsman trained in foreign techniques.\\"Laings, 148; NMS database The brooch has a complex construction typical of the most elaborate Irish brooches. Panels of filigree work were created separately on gold trays, which were then fitted into the main silver- gilt body. On the reverse four panels of silver-gilt were also inserted; as in other examples like the Tara Brooch the decoration on the reverse uses older curvilinear \\"Celtic\\" motifs looking back to La T√®ne style Insular Celtic decoration, though on the Hunterston Brooch such motifs also appear on the front. The brooch was worn by rulers or gifted from the ruler to people of importance. The Hunterston brooch showed power and wealth in the viking civilisation age. The back of the brooch has a scratched inscription in runes in the Old Norse language, probably 10th century, \\"Melbrigda owns this brooch\\"; Ma√©l Brigda, \\"devotee of Bridgit\\" is a common Gaelic female name, though seen as male by other sources.Whitfield, Tara Brooch, 215; Youngs, 91-92, \\"an Irishman Melbrigda\\". Much later ownership inscriptions are not uncommon on elaborate Celtic brooches, often from Norse-Gael contexts. The Hunterston Brooch is clearly an object of very high status, indicating the power and great prestige of its owner. With the Tara Brooch in Dublin, and the Londesborough Brooch in the British Museum, it is considered one of the finest of over 50 highly elaborate Irish Celtic brooches to survive,Youngs, 90 and is \\"arguably the earliest of the ornate penannular brooches from Britain and Ireland\\".Laings, 148 NotesReferences * Lamb, Rev.
