The song is notable for its serene yet pointed melody and its unique lyrics, which compare Queen Guinevere to the object of the singer's affection, referred to as \\"m'lady\\". Composition In a Rolling Stone interview, Crosby remarked: \\"That is a very unusual song, it's in a very strange tuning (EBDGAD) with strange time signatures. It's about three women that I loved. One of whom was Christine Hinton - the girl who got killed who was my girlfriend - and one of whom was Joni Mitchell, and the other one is somebody that I can't tell. It might be my best song.\\" According to Robert Christgau, the song was based on a three-note motif from the 1960 Miles Davis album Sketches of Spain. Lyrical themes The song also deals with the importance of freedom. It may have been written about Queen Guinevere from the perspective of a man addressing a woman; it has been speculated that Crosby wrote about her from the perspective of Sir Lancelot of ancient Welsh lore. \\"Guinnevere\\" could also be referring to Nancy Ross, who lived with David Crosby and (according to author David McGowan) drew pentagrams on the wall. She would leave Crosby in 1966 for Gram Parsons, who came from big money in Florida, in the orange/citrus business. These facts make the \\"Nancy Ross\\" theory more believable: in the song, Crosby sings that Guinnevere \\"drew pentagrams,\\" and that \\"peacocks wandered aimlessly underneath an orange tree.\\" Personnel *David Crosby: lead vocals, guitars *Graham Nash: lead vocals Cover versions Miles Davis recorded a version of the song during a January 27, 1970 session. It was first released, in edited form, on the 1979 compilation Circle in the Round, with a longer version appearing on the 1998 release of The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions. According to David Crosby's 2016 podcast interview with Marc Maron, Davis played it for Crosby at the former's home before releasing it. Crosby did not recognize any resemblance between Davis' version and his composition and Davis kicked him out of his house.http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-751-david-crosby Later in 1970 Herbie Mann recorded a cover version, appearing the next year on his album Memphis Two-Step. In late 2017 Crosby tweeted that he changed his mind about Miles' recording: \\"Finally ....after so many years of not getting it ....I listened to Miles and his band doing Guinnevere....and got it...\\" References External links * https://archive.is/20150411003043/http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/nwsltr105.html Category:Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young songs Category:1969 songs Category:Songs written by David Crosby ","title":"Guinnevere"},{"id":"19999664","text":"Sir Charles Kemeys, 3rd Baronet (died December 1702) was a Welsh landowner in the late 17th century and early 18th century in south Wales and MP for both Monmouthshire and Monmouth Boroughs.

From further west it can be accessed from the Burke Developmental Road at Petford. History Irvinebank with Wades Royal Hotel, National Bank, School of Arts and other buildings, circa 1906 First known as Gibbs Camp, the town was founded in 1884 by John Moffat, who had purchased the mining leases from the original prospectors. He built a dam, a mill, smelters and other infrastructure that attracted settlers and miners to the area. It became a thriving town with an economy based on mining, milling and smelting. Montalbion State School opened circa 1888 and closed in 1906. Irvinebank Post Office opened on 1 June 1885 (a receiving office had been open from 1884). Stannary Hills Provisional School opened on 18 January 1904. In 1907 it became Stannary Hills State School. It closed circa 1931. Rocky Bluffs Provisional School opened on 1904 and closed on 1910. Gurrumba Provisional School opened in 1907. On 1 January 1909 it became Gurrumba Provisional School. It closed circa 1916. In the ten years up to the 1911 census the population had swelled from 619 to 1264, but another 10 years saw it reduced back to only 607 and continued to fall. At the 2006 census, Irvinebank had a population of 311.

However, most of the Chinese in the country trace their roots to three distinct waves of migration: 1930s settlement on Zanzibar, workers sent by the Chinese government in the 1960s and 1970s as part of development assistance to Tanzania, and private entrepreneurs and traders who began doing business there during the 1990s. History The Chinese built TAZARA Railway linking Zambia with Tanzania. Most foreign labour in Tanganyika's history as a German colony came from other parts of Africa; however, there were a few Chinese as well. In 1891, the German East Africa Company hired 491 Chinese and Javanese labourers from Singapore to work on plantations in Usambara. Separately, a community of overseas Chinese began to form on the island of Zanzibar, by then a British possession, in the 1930s. The Chinese noodles they produced there became a popular staple food for the local population, especially for the evening iftar meal which marks the end of the day's fasting during Ramadan. In 1969, a few years after Tanganyika and Zanzibar achieved independence from the British Empire and merged to become Tanzania, the People's Republic of China agreed to provide financing and technical assistance for the construction of the TAZARA Railway, intended to give Zambia an alternative to an existing railway route passing through Rhodesia, and allow them to export copper through ports in Tanzania instead. The first thousand Chinese railway workers came to Dar Es Salaam on board the ocean liner Yao Hao in August 1969.; they would be followed by twenty to thirty thousand more in the next five years. At any given time, Chinese composed between twenty-five and thirty percent, or 13,000, of the thirty to forty thousand workers on the railway. Most of them returned home after their stint in the country, but due to the emphasis placed on speedy construction, they had little time to train their Tanzanian counterparts to replace them; as a result, teams of Chinese experts continued to work for the railway authority as late as 2004. During these years, China also sent some advisors to Zanzibar for work on other development projects. Finally, roughly 200 doctors from Jiangsu were dispatched all over Tanzania on two-year stints; people's positive experience with these doctors laid the foundations for the later popularity of traditional Chinese medicine, though they themselves were not TCM practitioners. The population of old overseas Chinese continued to decrease; by 2008, just twenty remained in Dar es Salaam, including a Meixian Hakka couple from South Africa who ran a Chinese restaurant, and a number of Burmese Chinese who traced their roots to the Taishan and Kaiping counties of Guangdong. However, their numbers were bolstered by the arrival of new expatriate businessmen and entrepreneurs beginning in the 1990s. Numbers In 2000, statistics of Tanzania's Immigration Department showed that they had issued work or residence permits to just 239 Chinese nationals, making them one of the smaller groups of foreigners in the country. However, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported in 2008 that 10,000 Chinese people live in the country. In January 2013, the Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania was quoted saying that there were more than 30,000 Chinese people living in Tanzania. Business and employment The new wave of Chinese expatriates in the 1990s initially came to Tanzania with the intention of working in more typical industries, such as construction, textiles, or food products. However, the World Health Organization's push for privatisation of health care in Tanzania provided unexpected business opportunities to them; despite the fact that most lacked any medical training, they began setting up traditional Chinese medicine clinics, the first of which was established in 1996. Qualified practitioners came later, but in the early 2000s, the majority were still learning on the job.

It has been making wine for over 800 years.  History  After the donation of Verona in 983 the archbishopric of Mainz, the new owner, invested in vine growing. However, vines had been cultivated there since Roman times. The manor house was named after the Lords of Winkel; Vollradus is a given name. In 1218 a \\"Vollradus in Winkela\\" (so-called knight Vollradus), in 1268 a \\"Conradus dictus Vollradus armiger\\" is documented. No building originating from this time is traceable. Today the core building of the estate is a substantial tower house, as a water castle surrounded by a square pond. Therefore, the house is only reachable by bridge. This keep can be traced to the first third of the 14th century and the family of Greiffenclau, the heirs of the Lords of Winkel. The octagon stage tower, flanking the donjon, was erected in 1471; the bay window was added in 1620. Above the doorway the coat of arms of the Greiffenclau family is to be seen. In 1684 the present two-winged manor house was built by Georg Phillip Greiffenclau von Vollrads near the tower. His son Johann Erwein erected the estate buildings around 1700, as well as boundary walls around the manor garden, and finally equipped the tower with a typical baroque roof. In 1907/1908 Countess Clara Matuschka-Greiffenclau had the buildings remodelled. She increased the height of the southern wing of the mansion by a third floor, added two towers with an onion dome, and enlarged the terraces and the bay windows at the Donjon. In 1975 Erwein Matuschka Greiffenclau took charge of the property, which was heavily in debt. Although an important figure in the emergence of a new or rediscovered style of high quality dry Rheingau wine in the 1980s and 1990s, he was not successful in reorganising his estate. When in 1997 the principal bank decided on the declaration of bankruptcy, Erwein, who was then also the chairman of the VDP-Rheingau, took his gun, went to his beloved vineyards, and committed suicide.Andr√© Domin√©: Wine, Publisher: K√∂nemann, 2001, p. 489, Hugh Johnson: Schlo√ü Vollrads in: Pocket Wine Book 2000 Since then, the estate has belonged to the Nassauische Sparkasse bank, which runs the manor house as well as the vineyards and a restaurant.Weingut Schlo√ü Vollrads in Wein-Plus The winery is a member of the Verband Deutscher Pr√§dikats- und Qualit√§tsweing√ºter. Most of the time the manor house is not open to the public. Access is only allowed for special events. In the summer live music acts take place, especially of the Rheingau Musik Festival, and in the harvest season a public bar is opened in the center court.  Geography  Schloss Vollrads is a vineyard site documented since the Middle Ages in the Rheingau within the boundaries of the collective site (Gro√ülage) of Honigberg between Johannisberg, Winkel, Mittelheim and Erbach. The estate claims to be the oldest winery of Germany, which is not verifiable for the distinct single vineyard site (Einzellage) of 58 ha size. Schloss Vollrads is in fact a vineyard designation (Einzellage) in its own right (as is Schloss Johannisberg), and one of a handful historic German vineyards which according to the wine law do not have to display a village name, which otherwise would be Winkel, on the label. Thus, the wines are simply labelled as \\"Schloss Vollrads Riesling\\", which signifies both the vineyard site, the producer and the grape variety. The Riesling grape is the only grape variety used in the winery. Nevertheless, the whole range of Pr√§dikat designations such as Kabinett, Sp√§tlese, Auslese, Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese up to the Eiswein is vinified. Schloss Vollrads also produces dry wines under the Erstes Gew√§chs designation.Rheingau Top Growers The Vollrads Lage is highly \\"terroir-expressive\\", meaning that the character of Riesling wines is clearly influenced by the wine's place of origin.THE FINE WINE REVIEW Number Nr. 116 2005 IN GERMANY, p.4 In order to avoid cork taint, the wine is sealed with Vino-Lok glass stoppers.VINO-LOK ‚Äì the new generation of wine closures are coming!

Born in Salford, Birch joined Manchester United as a 14-year-old in May 1946, before turning professional two years later. He was 17 when he made his debut on 27 August 1949, playing at inside left in a 1‚Äì1 home draw with West Bromwich Albion. Birch was always on the fringes of the United first team, but apart from a spell midway through the 1950‚Äì51 season in which he scored four goals in nine appearances, he never lived up to his potential and was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers for ¬£10,000 towards the end of the 1951‚Äì52 season. His tenure at Wolves was short, however, and he was transferred to Lincoln City after just nine months in the West Midlands. In three years with Lincoln, Birch played in more than fifty matches, scoring 15 goals. He then dropped out of league football for a season in 1955, joining Boston United, before moving to Barrow in 1956. He became a first team regular at Barrow, making 60 appearances and scoring 27 goals in just over two seasons there. Exeter City signed him in September 1958, but he was on the move again in January 1960, this time to Oldham Athletic. He moved to Rochdale in March 1961, before going into coaching at the end of the 1961‚Äì62 season. He dipped in and out of playing for the next few years, picking up appearances for Boston United, Mossley and Ellesmere Port, but his coaching experience eventually led him to Blackburn Rovers in 1967, where he became the coach to one of the club's junior teams. Birch was trainer of Galatasaray from 1971 until 1973. He won two consecutive championships with Galatasaray in the Turkish First Leaguehttp://www.galatasaray.org/tarih/tarihte_bugun.php?frm_date=11-18 and Helsingborgs IF. In the summer of 1980 he returned to Galatasaray, but was not able to be successful like he was in the 1970s with the club and his contract was terminated after one-and-a-half years.

E. 1970, Astrophysical Journal, 160, 485 The isotopic ratio of [12C]/[13C] was determined to be about or less than 50% in the galactic disk.Henkel, C.; Guesten, R.; Gardner, F. F. 1985, Astronomy and Astrophysics, 143, 148 Formaldehyde has been used to map out kinematic features of dark clouds located near Gould's Belt of local bright stars.Sandqvist, A.; Tomboulides, H.; Lindblad, P. O. 1988, Astronomy and Astrophysics, 205, 225 In 2007, the first H2CO 6 cm maser flare was detected.Araya, E. _et al_. 2007, Astrophysical Journal, 654, L95 It was a short duration outburst in IRAS 18566 + 0408 that produced a line profile consistent with the superposition of two Gaussian components, which leads to the belief that an event outside the maser gas triggered simultaneous flares at two different locations. Although this was the first maser flare detected, H2 masers have been observed since 1974 by Downes and Wilson in NGC 7538.Hoffman, I. M.; Goss, W. M.; Palmer, P. 2007, Astrophysical Journal, 654, 971 Unlike OH, H2O, and CH3OH, only five galactic star forming regions have associated formaldehyde maser emission, which has only been observed through the 110 ‚Üí 111 transition. According to Araya et al., H2CO are different from other masers in that they are weaker than most other masers (such as OH, CH3OH, and H2O) and have only been detected near very young massive stellar objects.Araya et al. 2007, Astrophysical Journal, 669, 1050 Unlike OH, H2O, and CH3OH, only five galactic star forming regions have associated formaldehyde maser emission, which has only been observed through the 110 ‚Üí 111 transition.Hoffman, I.

G. Mangum et al. 2008, Astrophysical Journal, 673, 832. Interstellar reactions The gas- phase reaction that produces formaldehyde possesses modest barriers and is too inefficient to produce the abundance of formaldehyde that has been observed.Woon, D.E. 2002, Astrophysical Journal, 569, 541. One proposed mechanism for the formation is the hydrogenation of CO ice, shown below. :H + CO ‚Üí HCO + H ‚Üí H2CO (rate constant=9.2*10‚àí3 s‚àí1) This is the basic production mechanism leading to H2CO; there are several side reactions that take place with each step of the reaction that are based on the nature of the ice on the grain according to David Woon. The rate constant presented is for the hydrogenation of CO. The rate constant for the hydrogenation of HCO was not provided as it was much larger than that of the hydrogenation of CO, likely because HCO is a radical.Awad et al. 2005, Astrophysical Journal, 626, 262. Awad et al. mention that this is a surface level reaction only and only the monolayer is considered in calculations; this includes the surface within cracks in the ice. Formaldehyde is relatively inactive in gas phase chemistry in the interstellar medium. Its action is predominantly focused in grain- surface chemistry on dust grains in interstellar cloudsW. A. Schutte et al. 1993, Science, 259, 1143.,.W. A. Schutte et al. 1993, Icarus, 104, 118. Reactions involving formaldehyde have been observed to produce molecules containing C-H, C-O, O-H, and C-N bonds. While these products are not necessarily well known, Schutte et al. believe these to be typical products of formaldehyde reactions at higher temperatures, polyoxymethylene, methanolamine, methanediol, and methoxyethanol for example (see Table 2). Formaldehyde is believed to be the primary precursor for most of the complex organic material in the interstellar medium, including amino acids. Formaldehyde most often reacts with NH3, H2O, CH3OH, CO, and itself, H2CO,. The three dominating reactions are shown below. :H2CO + NH3 ‚Üí amine (when [NH3]:[H2CO] > .2) :H2CO + H2O ‚Üí diols (always dominate as [H2O] > [H2CO]) :H2CO + H2CO ‚Üí [-CH2-O-]n (catalyzed by NH3 when [NH3]:[H2CO] > .005) There is no kinetic data available for these reactions as the entire reaction is not verified nor well understood. These reactions are believed to take place during warm-up of the ice on grains which releases the molecules to react. These reactions begin at temperatures as low as 40K - 80K but may take place at even lower temperatures. Note that many other reactions are listed on the UMIST RATE06 database. Importance of observation Formaldehyde appears to be a useful probe for astrochemists due to its low reactivity in the gas phase and to the fact that the 110 \\\\- 111 and 211 \\\\- 212 K-doublet transitions are rather clear. Formaldehyde has been used in many capacities and to investigate many systems including, * Determination of the [12C]/[13C] ratio to be less than 50 in the galactic disc. * Mapping of the kinematic features of dark clouds located near Gould's Belt of local bright stars. The radial velocities determined for these clouds lead Sandqvist et al. to believe that the clouds participate in the expansion of the local system of H gas and bright stars. * Determination of the temperature of molecular formation from the ratio of ortho-/para- H2CO. H2CO is a good candidate for this process because of the near zero probability of nuclear spin conversion in gas phase protostar environments.M. Tudorie et al. 2006, Astronomy and Astrophysics, 453, 755. * Determination of the spatial density of H2 and dense gas mass in several galaxies with varying luminosity (see Subsequent Discoveries for list of galaxies). The spatial densities calculated fell in the range of 104.7 to 105.7 cm‚àí3 and dense gas masses calculated fell in the range of 0.6x108 to 0.77x109 solar masses. Mangum et al. noticed that the galaxies with lower infrared luminosity had lower dense gas masses and that this seemed to be a real trend despite the small data set.

Early life He was born in Hothorpe, Northamptonshire in 1620 and educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry. He graduated with a B.A. degree from Trinity College, Oxford in 1638, where he had a family connection with the President, Ralph Kettell (1563‚Äì1643).Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), pp. 74‚Äì75. Oxford science and medicine He originally intended a career in the Church of England, and was ordained in 1644, but his prospects were disrupted by the English Civil War, and he turned to medicine. He collaborated with Thomas Willis, and it was to Bathurst that Willis dedicated his first medical publication, the Diatribae Duae of 1659. Bathurst was active in the intellectual ferment of the time, and very well connected. In the account given by John Wallis of the precursor groups to the Royal Society of London, Bathurst is mentioned as one of the Oxford experimentalists who gathered from 1648‚Äì9. Also in that group were Willis, William Petty and Seth Ward.. fordham.edu The group expanded in the 1650s when it gathered around John Wilkins of Wadham College, close however to Oliver Cromwell, and then included also Jonathan Goddard, Thomas Millington, Laurence Rooke, and Christopher Wren. Later Robert Boyle joined. Bathurst belonged also to the overlapping circle of physicians following the tradition of William Harvey, and which included again Willis, George Ent, Walter Charleton, Nathaniel Highmore, and Charles Scarburgh; these were royalists who had attended Charles I of England. In the celebrated case of Anne Greene, who survived a hanging, the physicians intending to dissect the cadaver were Bathurst, Petty, Willis, and Henry Clerke. He worked in practical medicine under the physician Daniel Whistler (1619‚Äì1684). This was during the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1652 to 1654, when Whistler was in charge of wounded naval personnel. He theorised fruitfully in 1654 on respiration, in a dissertation for his higher medical degree, and his ideas were later taken up, by Boyle and John Mayow. Later life On the English Restoration in 1660 he reverted to a career in the church. There is a story that he had acted as archdeacon and deputy to Robert Skinner, Bishop of Oxford, who was imprisoned by the Parliamentarians.. family.ray-jones.org.uk He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1663, and was made President of Trinity College in 1664, where he initiated building work to designs by Christopher Wren, a personal friend.. Trinity College Oxford He also swayed Samuel Parker from Presbyterian views to an Anglican outlook. In 1670, he was Dean of Wells Cathedral. For three years from 1673, he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, earning a complimentary reference in a John Dryden poem. John Harris, a Trinity College student in the 1680s, wrote about the intellectual and scientific atmosphere of the college under Bathurst.Dictionary of Scientific Biography. Chlt.org (1946-01-06).

Card, a means of cutting and glue are all that is needed. Some models are 100% card, while others use items of other materials to reinforce the model.

Models to cut out were also a feature of paperboard folding cartons. For many years breakfast cereal makers had models to cut out on their packets.

He served as a staff officer and as colonel of the 79th Indiana Infantry Regiment and an acting brigade commander. In 1866, he was nominated and confirmed for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865. Early life Frederick Knefler (Knoepfler Frigyes) was born in Arad, Hungary, son of Nathan Knoepfler, a Hungarian Jew and a physician. He enlisted with his father in the revolutionary forces during the 1848-49 Hungarian War of Liberation. After the revolutionary forces were defeated, the entire Knoepfler family fled to the United States, first to New York, then to Indianapolis, Indiana. As one of the earliest Jewish families settling in Indianapolis, Dr. Knoepfler was one of the original founders of the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation.http://www.jewish- history.com/civilwar/knefler.html Knefler trained as a carpenter in New York, a trade he continued in Indianapolis as he studied law. He became assistant to the clerk of Marion County, Indiana, in which position he became acquainted with Lew Wallace. Civil War service =11th Indiana Infantry= Upon President Lincoln's proclamation calling for the raising of 75,000 troops after the firing on Fort Sumter, Governor Oliver Morton appointed Lew Wallace Adjutant-General with the task of raising Indiana's quota. Wallace, in turn, appointed Knefler as his principal assistant. After raising five regiments, Wallace requested and received command of the 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment, commissioning Knefler as a first lieutenant in it; he was promoted to captain on June 5, 1861. The 11th Indiana Infantry was sent to the Washington, D.C. area, participated in several skirmishes, but missed the first battle of Bull Run. Their 3-month term of enlistment expired, the regiment was shipped back to Indianapolis and mustered out. When Wallace then formed a new 11th Indiana Infantry in August 1861, Knefler was commissioned a captain in it. Soon after, however, Wallace became a brigadier general and Knefler went with him as his assistant adjutant general. =Aide to General Lew Wallace= Wallace's brigade was part of Grant's force in the capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, playing a key part in preventing the Confederate forces from forcing an escape from Fort Donelson through the Union lines. Wallace's report of the battle stated that Knefler's ‚Äúprompt and efficient service in the field‚Äù and his ‚Äúcourage and fidelity have earned my lasting gratitude.‚Äù Knefler was also with Wallace in the Battle of Shiloh, and his loss of the messenger's written transcription of Grant's oral order during the battle probably prevented resolution of the dispute between the two generals over whether the ambiguity of the order or Wallace's actions caused his failure to reach the battle on the first day. =Colonel of 79th Indiana Infantry= After Wallace's removal from active service, Indiana governor Oliver Morton appointed Knefler the commanding colonel of the newly formed 79th Indiana Infantry Regiment in August 1862. Sent to join Buell's Army of the Ohio, his regiment, as part of the brigade led by Brigadier General Samuel Beatty, became involved in the battles of Stones River, Chickamauga, and Missionary Ridge. At Stones River, Knefler reported his regiment lost one-third of its 341 men, including one- half of its commissioned officers. The 79th Indiana captured a key battery during the first day of Chickamauga, but was cut in half in the Confederate breakthrough on the second day, Knefler's half attempting to regroup Beatty's brigade until withdrawn, the other half helping hold Snodgrass Hill until the Confederate charge was finally repulsed. In the battle of Missionary Ridge, Knefler was in command of the combined 79th Indiana and 86th Indiana infantry regiments that led the unexpected charge up the center of the ridge. General Beatty's report after the battle complimented Knefler for the charging of Missionary Ridge, and fellow colonel George Dick wrote that he ‚Äúrichly merits a commission as brigadier-general for his gallantry displayed in the charging and taking of Missionary Ridge.‚Äù According to the Jewish-American History Foundation in recognition of the services rendered by the regiment at Chickamauga, the state of Indiana erected a monument on the battlefield after the war. The tablet of the monument reads: INDIANA'S TRIBUTE TO HER SEVENTY- NINTH REGIMENT INFANTRY Col. Frederick Knefler, Commanding First Brigade (Samuel Beatty) Third Division (Van Cleve) Twenty-first Corps (Crittenden) =Atlanta Campaign= Following Missionary Ridge, the 79th Indiana moved toward Knoxville and participated in the east Tennessee winter campaign until transferred to join General Sherman's Atlanta Campaign. During this campaign, because of General Beatty's illness, Knefler was given command of the entire brigade, although remaining a colonel. Knefler's brigade participated in the entire campaign, playing a major role in the battles of Pickett‚Äôs Mill, Peach Tree Creek, Jonesboro, and Lovejoy‚Äôs Station, and marching into Atlanta. =Franklin-Nashville Campaign= When Confederate general Hood decided to cut Sherman's supply line by invading Tennessee, Knefler's brigade was one of those sent to join General Thomas to counter Hood. In the battle of Franklin, Knefler's brigade guarded one flank as Hood put all his effort into a massive charge on the Union center, and thus suffered few casualties. In the battle of Nashville, Knefler's brigade on December 16, 1864 formed the reserve behind which the two charging brigades reformed after being repulsed. He then ordered his brigade to charge the confused enemy, forcing them into retreat and capturing much of their arms. Knefler's brigade was part of the army preparing to move from east Tennessee into Virginia when the war ended. Following the final review of Thomas's army in Nashville on May 9, 1865, he returned with the 79th Indiana Infantry to Indianapolis where he was mustered out on June 7, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 336. =Brevet brigadier general appointment= On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Knefler for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 750. Post-war activities Following the war, Knefler became a lawyer in Indianapolis, joining in partnership with former U. S. Attorney John Hanna. After his partner was elected in Congress in 1876, Knefler was appointed head of the pension office in Indianapolis by President Rutherford B. Hayes, where he served eight years. As president of the board of regents of Indiana's Soldiers and Sailors Monument, he oversaw the laying of the cornerstone in the center of Indianapolis on August 22, 1889, but died before its completion in 1902. Frederick Knefler died on June 14, 1901 in Indianapolis, Indiana and is buried Crown Hill Cemetery. His grave can be found in Section 8, Lot 22.

Listed at 6' 1\\", 180 lb., Stevens was a switch-hitter and threw left-handed. He was born in Van Houten, New Mexico. Career Stevens spent 20 years playing, coaching, and managing professional baseball, much of it in the Pacific Coast League, but is best remembered as the player who delivered the first major league hit off pitching legend Satchel Paige. At an early age Stevens played baseball and basketball, but he also was always interested in music, playing guitar, fiddle and percussion, and became an accomplished tap dancer in his youth. Following his graduation from Long Beach Polytechnic High School in early 1937, he enrolled at the Cal Berkeley, but turned his attention to baseball and signed a contract with the St. Louis Browns of the American League before the 1938 season. He went to spring training in San Antonio, Texas before reporting to the Williamston Class-D team of the Coastal Plain League, where he hit .288 with 10 home runs in 97 games. In 1939, Stevens was promoted to Class-C Johnstown of the Middle Atlantic League, where he hit .290 in 128 games. His most productive season came in 1940 with Class-B Springfield of the Three-I League, when he hit .316 with 74 RBI for a team that won the league championship. Stevens' rapid advancement through the Browns' system indicated that he could be considered a major league prospect. He moved up again in 1940, this time to Class-A San Antonio of the Texas League. He did not hit quite as well (.264 in 158 games), but gained attention for his flashy defense at first base and his aggressive base running. Then he was added to the Browns' roster in late September, but did not appear in any games. In 1941 Stevens joined the Double-A Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association, one step below the major leagues. He had a fine season for the Mud Hens, hitting .290 in 145 games, earning a promotion to the Browns in September. He appeared in four games and went 2-for-13 (.154) with two runs and two RBI. He returned to Toledo in 1942 but slumped to .250 and did not get recalled in September. After the season, he entered the US Army Air Force and spent the next three years in the Pacific Theatre, first in California and later in Tinian, Guam and Okinawa. Stevens rejoined the Browns after being discharged before the 1946 season, appearing in 122 games while hitting .248 with three home runs. As always, his defense and base-running were generally first rate, but his lack of power kept him from a full-fledged career in the majors. In 1947 he was outrighted back to Toledo, where he batted .279 in 141 games. He returned to the Browns in 1948, just in time to take part in a bit of baseball history on July 9 at Cleveland Stadium. With the Browns leading the Cleveland Indians 4‚Äì1 in the bottom of the fourth inning, Cleveland manager Lou Boudreau pulled his starting pitcher, Bob Lemon, replacing him with the 42-year-old rookie Satchel Paige to start the fifth inning. It was Paige's first game in the major leagues, and the first batter he faced was Stevens, who had faced Paige many times in exhibition matches in California, and remembered hitting him well. In this instance, he spoiled the story by lining a single to left field on the second pitch he saw. Nevertheless, Paige retired the next three hitters to get out of the inning unscathed. During his third stint with the Browns, Stevens hit a .260 average in 85 games, and was sold to the Hollywood Stars (PCL), hitting .321 for them over 38 games at the tail end of the 1948 season. Stevens played for Hollywood until 1954, and was part of three PCL championships with the Stars in 1949, 1952 and 1953. He was remarkably consistent during this period, hitting .297, .288, .292 and .278 from 1949 through 1952, as well as playing solid defense at first base. The Stars sold Stevens' contract to the San Francisco Seals (PCL). He played for his new team for the next year and a half as a reserve player and pinch hitter, also serving as a player-coach for the 1955 season. When the Boston Red Sox purchased the Seals at the end of the season, Stevens was sent, along with some of their other surplus players, to the Louisville Colonels (American Association). Stevens, however, had no interest in going to the new team, instead buying out his own contract so that he could take an opportunity to manage the Amarillo Gold Sox in the Western League. He hit .335 for Amarillo in 1956, also managing his team to the league's title series, earning the circuit's manager of the year award. He later played and coached for the Sacramento Solons (PCL) in 1957, his last professional baseball season. In a three-season major league career, Stevens was a .251 hitter (184-for-732) with four home runs and 55 RBI in 211 games, including 89 runs, 29 doubles, eight triples, six stolen bases, and a .333 on-base percentage. Post-baseball career Following his playing retirement, Stevens worked for a company that acidized oil wells. In early 1960 he served as secretary- treasurer of the Association of Professional Ball Players of America and kept the job for 38 years, until reaching the age of eighty in 1998. He was instrumental in modernizing the structure of organization, setting up a constitution and bylaws to conform to new tax laws, as his job kept him in permanent contact with the baseball community. The Chuck Stevens Award, created by the APBPA, is presented in his honor. The award is presented to the Southern California resident who had the most outstanding season in the minor leagues. Previous winners of this award, Sean Burroughs, Keith Ginter, Jason Hirsh, Evan Longoria, Ryan Madson, Jerry Owens and Jeremy Reed have all played in the major leagues. The Pacific Coast League: A Statistical Record, 1903‚Äì1957 is a complete PCL encyclopedia, introduced by Stevens in collaboration with Roger Osenbaugh, which shows complete statistics for every player in the league, presented in year-by-year, team-by-team format, with batting and pitching categories. The book also included leader boards, season and lifetime record holders, league officials, playoff records and attendance.The Pacific Coast League: A Statistical Record, 1903‚Äì1957, by Dennis Snelling. McFarland & Company (January 1995), Stevens also parlayed his Hollywood prestige into roles in two baseball-related films, appearing in The Stratton Story (Sam Wood, 1949), starred by James Stewart and June Allyson, and The Winning Team (Lewis Seiler, 1952), featuring Doris Day and Ronald Reagan. Stevens was recognized as the oldest living major league ballplayer, as well as the oldest living former member of the Baltimore Orioles organization, until his death on May 28, 2018.Baseball notes: Stevens, MLB‚Äôs oldest living player and a former St. Louis Brown, dies at 99 See also *1948 Cleveland Indians season References External links *Retrosheet *SABR project * Category:1918 births Category:2018 deaths Category:St. Louis Browns players Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:United States Army Air Forces personnel of World War II Category:Baseball players from New Mexico Category:United States Army Air Forces soldiers Category:Military personnel from New Mexico ","title":"Chuck Stevens"},{"id":"20000400","text":"Job performance assesses whether a person performs a job well. Job performance, studied academically as part of industrial and organizational psychology, also forms a part of human resources management. Performance is an important criterion for organizational outcomes and success. John P. Campbell describes job performance as an individual-level variable, or something a single person does. This differentiates it from more encompassing constructs such as organizational performance or national performance, which are higher- level variables. Campbell, J. P. (1990). Modeling the performance prediction problem in industrial and organizational psychology. In M. D. Dunnette & L. M. Hough (Eds.), Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology (pp. 687-732). Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press, Inc. Campbell, J. P., McCloy, R. A., Oppler, S. H., & Sager, C. E. (1993). A theory of performance: In N. Schmitt & W. C. Borman (Eds.), Personnel Selection in Organizations (pp. 35-70). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.  Features  There are several key features to Campbell's conceptualization of job performance which help clarify what job performance means. = Outcomes = First, Campbell defines performance as behavior, which is something done by an employee. This concept differentiates performance from outcomes. Outcomes result partially from an individual's performance, but they are also the result of other influences. In other words, there are more factors determine outcomes than just an employee's behaviors and actions. Campbell allows for exceptions when defining performance as behavior. For instance, he clarifies that performance does not have to be directly observable actions of an individual. It can consist of mental productions such as answers or decisions. However, performance needs to be under the individual's control, regardless of whether the performance of interest is mental or behavioral. The difference between individual controlled action and outcomes is best conveyed through an example. In a sales job, a favorable outcome is a certain level of revenue generated through the sale of something (merchandise, or some service such as insurance). Revenue can be generated or not, depending on the behavior of employees. When the employee performs this sales job well, he is able to move more merchandise. However, certain factors other than employees' behavior influence revenue generated. For example, sales might slump due to economic conditions, changes in customer preferences, production bottlenecks, etc. In these conditions, employee performance can be adequate, yet sales can remain low. The first is performance and the second is the effectiveness of that performance. One can de-couple these two because performance is not the same as effectiveness.Campbell, J.P., Dunnette, M.D., Lawler, E.E., & Weick, K.E. (1970). Managerial behavior, performance, and effectiveness. New York: McGraw- Hill. Another closely related construct is productivity. Campbell, J.P., & Campbell, R.J. (1988). Productivity in Organizations: New perspectives from industrial and organizational psychology. San Francisco: Jossy-Bass. One can think of productivity as a comparison of the amount of effectiveness that results from a certain level of cost associated with that effectiveness. In other words, effectiveness is the ratio of outputs to inputs‚Äîthose inputs being effort, monetary costs, resources, etc. Utility, another related construct, is defined as the value of a particular level of performance, effectiveness, or productivity. Utilities of performance, effectiveness, and productivity are value judgments. = Organizational goal relevance = Another key feature of job performance is that it has to be goal relevant. Performance must be directed toward organizational goals that are relevant to the job or role. Therefore, performance does not include activities where effort is expended toward achieving peripheral goals. For example, the effort put toward the goal of getting to work in the shortest amount of time is not performance (except where it is concerned with avoiding lateness). = Factors = Despite the emphasis on defining and predicting job performance, it is not a single unified construct. There are vastly many jobs each with different performance standards. Job performance consists of more than one kind of behavior. Campbell (1990) proposed an eight factor model of performance based on factor analytic research that attempts to capture factors of job performance existent across all jobs. # The first factor is task specific behaviors which include those behaviors that an individual undertakes as part of a job. They are the core substantive tasks that delineate one job from another. # On the other hand, non-task specific behaviors, the second factor, are those behaviors which an individual is required to undertake which do not pertain only to a particular job. Returning to the sales person, an example of a task specific behavior would be showing a product to a potential customer. A non-task specific behavior of a sales person might be training new staff members. # Written and oral communication tasks refer to activities where the incumbent is evaluated, not on the content of a message necessarily, but on the adeptness with which they deliver the communication. Employees need to make formal and informal oral and written presentations to various audiences in many different jobs in the work force. # An individual's performance can also be assessed in terms of effort, either day to day, or when there are extraordinary circumstances. This factor reflects the degree to which people commit themselves to job tasks. # The performance domain might also include an aspect of personal discipline. Individuals would be expected to be in good standing with the law, not abuse alcohol, etc. # In jobs where people work closely or are highly interdependent, performance may include the degree to which a person helps out the groups and his or her colleagues. This might include acting as a good role model, coaching, giving advice or helping maintain group goals. # Many jobs also have a supervisory or leadership component. The individual will be relied upon to undertake many of the things delineated under the previous factor and in addition will be responsible for meting out rewards and punishments. These aspects of performance happen in a face to face manner. # Managerial and administrative performance entails those aspects of a job which serve the group or organization but do not involve direct supervision. A managerial task would be setting an organizational goal or responding to external stimuli to assist a group in achieving its goals. In addition a manager might be responsible for monitoring group and individual progress towards goals and monitoring organizational resources. Another taxonomy of job performance was proposed and developed for the US Navy by Murphy (1994). This model is significantly broader and breaks performance into only four dimensions. # Task-oriented behaviors are similar to task-specific behaviors in Campbell's model. This dimension includes any major tasks relevant to someone's job. # Interpersonally oriented behaviors are represented by any interaction the focal employee has with other employees. These can be task related or non-task related. This dimension diverges from Campbell's taxonomy because it included behaviors (small talk, socializing, etc.) that are not targeting an organization's goal. # Down-time behaviors are behaviors that employees engage in during their free time either at work or off-site. Down-time behaviors that occur off-site are only considered job performance when they subsequently affect job performance (for example, outside behaviors that cause absenteeism). # Destructive/hazardous behaviors. In addition to these models dividing performance into dimensions, others have identified different types of behaviors making up performance.  Types  Another way to divide up performance is in terms of task and contextual (citizenship and counterproductive) behaviors.Borman, W. C., & Motowidlo, S. J. (1993). Expanding the criterion domain to include elements of contextual performance. In N. Schmitt & W. C. Borman (Eds.), Personnel Selection in Organizations (pp. 71-98). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. Whereas task performance describes obligatory behaviors, contextual behaviors are behaviors that do not fulfill specific aspects of the job's required role. Citizenship behaviors are defined as behaviors which contribute to the goals of the organization through their effect on the social and psychological conditions. Counterproductive behaviors, on the other hand, are intentional actions by employees which circumvent the aims of the organization.Sackett, P. R., & DeVore, C. J. (2001). Counterproductive behaviors at work. In N. Anderson, D. Ones, H. Sinangil, & C. Viswesvaran (Eds.), Handbook of industrial, work, and organizational psychology (Vol. 1, pp. 145‚Äì164). London, UK: Sage.  Determinants  Campbell (1990) also suggested determinants of performance components. Individual differences on performance are a function of three main determinants: declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and skill, and motivation. Declarative knowledge represents the knowledge of a given task's requirements. For instance, declarative knowledge includes knowledge of principles, facts, ideas, etc. If declarative knowledge is knowing what to do, procedural knowledge and skill is knowing how to do it. For example, procedural knowledge and skill includes cognitive skill, perceptual skill, interpersonal skill, etc. The third predictor of performance is motivation, which refers to \\"a combined effect from three choice behaviors‚Äîchoice to expend effort, choice of level of effort to expend, and choice to persist in the expenditure of that level of effort\\" (Campbell, 1990). It reflects the direction, intensity, and persistence of volitional behaviors.Dalal, R. S. & Hulin, C. L. (2008). Motivation for what? A multivariate dynamic perspective of the criterion. In R. Kanfer, G. Chen, & R. D. Pritchard (Eds.), Work motivation: Past, present, and future (pp. 63-100). New York: Routledge. Campbell (1990) emphasized that the only way to discuss motivation as a direct determinant of behavior is as one or more of these choices. (See also Work motivation.) Campbell (1990) also mentioned several performance parameters that may have important implications for the job performance setting and should be investigated by industrial and organizational psychologists. The first one is the distinction between speed and accuracy. This distinction is similar to the one between quantity and quality.Lawler, E.E. (1973). Motivation in work organizations. Monterey, C.A: Brooks/Cole. Important questions that should be considered include: which is most valued by the organization, maximized speed, maximized accuracy, or some balance between the two? What kind of trade offs should an employee makes? The latter question is important because speed and accuracy for the same task may be independent of one another. The second distinction is between typical and maximum performance. Sackett, Zedeck, and Fogli did a study on supermarket cashiers and found that there was a substantial difference between scores reflecting their typical performance and scores reflecting their maximum performance. This study suggested the distinction between typical and maximum performance. Regular work situations reflect varying levels of motivation which result in typical performance. Special circumstances generate maximum employee motivation which results in maximum performance. Additionally, the impact of organizational justice perceptions on performance is believed to stem from Equity Theory. This would suggest that when people perceive injustice they seek to restore justice. One way that employees restore justice is by altering their level of performance. Procedural justice affects performance as a result of its impact on employee attitudes. Distributive justice affects performance when efficiency and productivity are involved. Improving justice perceptions improves productivity and performance. = Results of Personnel psychology = A meta-analysis of selection methods in personnel psychology found that general mental ability was the best overall predictor of job performance and training performance. While intelligence (general mental ability) is the strongest known predictor of job performance, that is less true for fields that are information-rich and require much instructional learning. Conscientiousness is another good predictor, but correlates with intelligence and is sometimes excluded from meta-analyses. The American Psychological Association's Research in Action article on personnel selection recounts evidence indicating that general cognitive ability and conscientiousness account for 20-30% of the variance in job performance, with more complex jobs falling into the upper portion of that range. However, an American Psychological Association article states that conscientiousness actually impedes success in creative, innovative or spontaneous jobs such as artistic, social and investigative jobs. That article states that other psychological factors are also related to job performance, namely: creativity, leadership, integrity, attendance and cooperation. There are differences in the extent to which job performance is predicted by intelligence depending on the occupation. A 1998 meta-analysis of the predictors of job performance for salesperson found that extraversion and conscientiousness predicted both ratings and sales, but general cognitive ability and age correlated with ratings but not sales. Social skills, a good mentor and interpersonal virtues predict career success, a concept related to job performance, and happiness, better than high education, IQ or cerebral virtues, except for certain occupations like theoretical physics. = Impact of work experience = The significance of work experience as a predictor of job performance is debatable as experience correlates with performance for people with 0-3 years‚Äô experience, but the correlation is attenuating to just 0.15 at 12+ years of experience. This suggests that experience doesn't increase performance after any more than a few years‚Äô experience. = Detrimental impact of bullying = Bullying results in a loss of productivity. In one study a moderate negative correlation was found between self-rated performance and bullying, with the ‚Äúcurrently bullied‚Äù on average reporting a decrease of productivity of approximately 7% compared with those who were neither bullied nor had witnessed bullying taking place.Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S \\"Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying\\" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)  Core self-evaluations  Job performance is a consistent and important outcome of core self-evaluations (CSE). The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997) as a dispositional predictor of job satisfaction, and involves four personality dimensions; locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. The way in which people appraise themselves using core self-evaluations has the ability to predict positive work outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance. The most popular theory relating the CSE trait to job performance argues that people with high CSE will be more motivated to perform well because they are confident they have the ability to do so. Motivation is generally the most accepted mediator of the core self-evaluations and job performance relationship. These relationships have inspired increasing amounts of research on core self-evaluations and suggest valuable implications about the importance this trait may have for organizations.  Role conflict  Role conflict can have many different effects on the work-life of an individual as well as their family-life. In a study in Taiwan, it was found that those suffering from role conflict also suffered greatly in their work performance, mainly in the form of lack of motivation. Those with role conflict did not do more than the bare minimum requirements at work. There was also a decline in the ability to assign tasks. Having multiple roles will often lead to job dissatisfaction. Experiencing role conflict within the work place may also lead to workplace bullying. When companies undergo organizational change workers often experience either a loss or a gain in areas of a workers job, thus changing the expectations of the worker. Change is often very stressful for workers. Workers who might have lost a degree of power may feel like they lost their authority and begin to lash out at other employees by being verbally abusive, purposefully withholding work related items, or sometimes even physically to withhold their status.Mark Dombeck, Ph.D. (July 24, 2007) The Long Term Effects Of Bullying Retrieved 6 June 2016. While there are many de-motivational effects of role conflict on work, there is also a positive. Those undergoing role conflict often had an increase in work creativity. Due to multiple roles, there is an increase in flexibility, different sources of information, and these people have many different perspectives to bring to the table.  Emotional intelligence  Research of emotional intelligence (EI) and job performance shows mixed results: a positive relation has been found in some of the studies, in others there was no relation or an inconsistent one. This led researchers Cote and Miners (2006)Cote, S. and Miners, C.T.H. (2006). \\"Emotional intelligence, cognitive intelligence and job performance\\", Administrative Science Quarterly, 51(1), pp1-28. to offer a compensatory model between EI and IQ, that posits that the association between EI and job performance becomes more positive as cognitive intelligence decreases, an idea first proposed in the context of academic performance (Petrides, Frederickson, & Furnham, 2004). The results of the former study supported the compensatory model: employees with low IQ get higher task performance and organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, the higher their EI. A meta-analytic review by Joseph and Newman also revealed that both Ability EI and Trait EI tend to predict job performance much better in jobs that require a high degree of emotional labor (where 'emotional labor' was defined as jobs that require the effective display of positive emotion). In contrast, EI shows little relationship to job performance in jobs that do not require emotional labor. In other words, emotional intelligence tends to predict job performance for emotional jobs only. A more recent study suggests that EI is not necessarily a universally positive trait. They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a negative relationship between EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men. This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another study assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success. In accordance with much of the other findings regarding EI and job performance, they found that levels of EI only predicted a small amount of entrepreneurial behavior.

It is the final major work by Marcuse, a founding member of the Frankfurt School. Summary The book is a response to previous writings within critical theory on the subject of art, notably those of Walter Benjamin and Theodor Adorno. Marcuse rejected Benjamin's call in \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\" for the politicization (i.e., a literal reflection of perceived political realities) of modern, reproducible art both to reflect the state of a society and to incite change. Like both Benjamin and Adorno, Marcuse believed that art promises resistance to societal repression, and that a cultural revolution is necessarily connected to a political or social revolution. Adorno (as represented mainly by his posthumous Aesthetic Theory) and Marcuse agreed that this possibility must be realized through artistic detachment and symbolism. Marcuse however offered a more inclusive and less radical suggestion for modern art's source of power than did Adorno, who believed that the works of high culture were the sole artistic source of potential emancipation. Marcuse instead pointed to what he perceived to be the successes of high culture and translated these to all areas of art. For Marcuse, art's promise of transcendence could only be fulfilled via a conceptual independence from society, but this independence is accessible through a host of media. The successful artist will attain truth in his work through detachment that results in symbolic representation. This successful art must necessarily invoke a longing for something utopian and the promise of ultimate happiness represented by beauty. This symbolic longing for fulfillment will awaken us from complacency.http://www.questiaschool.com/read/82289404 Marcuse stated in the book's introduction that he considered literature the primary source of his influence for this system, but feels that the ideas would apply to music and visual arts as well.http://www.marginalutility.org/wp- content/uploads/2011/10/aesthetic-dimension-_-marcuse.pdf He further stated that \\"This standard not only allows us to distinguish between \\"high\\" and \\"trivial\\" literature, opera and operetta, comedy and slapstick, but also between good and bad art within these genres.\\" References External links * Aesthetic Dimension at Questia School * Herbert Marcuse at Marxists.org Category:1977 non-fiction books Category:Aesthetics literature Category:Carl Hanser Verlag books Category:German non-fiction books Category:Works by Herbert Marcuse ","title":"The Aesthetic Dimension"},{"id":"20000450","title":"≈åmura Domain"},{"id":"20000461","text":"F.

Early life He was the son of Dutch political adventurer John William, Baron Ripperda and do√±a Francisca de Xarava del Castillo. His father was a scion of the ancient Dutch noble house of Ripperda, who became Duke of Ripperda and Prime Minister of Spain but was forced to flee the country following a scandal. Don Juan Mar√≠a Vicencio was subsequently raised in Madrid by his mother and her relatives, a devoutly Catholic, aristocratic Spanish family. Coat of Arms of Juan Mar√≠a Vicencio de Ripperd√°  Career  Baron de Ripperd√° started his military career in 1743 and rose to become a colonel in 1761. In 1769, he was appointed governor of Texas by the King of Spain and set sail for Mexico. During his stay in Mexico City he met and married (22 October) do√±a Mariana G√≥mez de Parada Gallo y Villavicencio. From February 1770, he lived in San Antonio with his wife and six children. Anticipating the impending reforms, he had made his headquarters in San Antonio rather than Los Adaes (now San Augustine). De Ripperd√°'s chief concern was the Apaches. He had to use threats to keep citizens from abandoning San Antonio from fear of marauders. He called for reinforcements from other presidios, which incurred the wrath of the missionaries saying he was risking ruin to the mission system. Then, fears of an imminent English attack swept over the province. His tenure as Governor was beset by political in-fighting and constant attempts to undermine his position. As such, he found himself besieged from two directions: Viceroy Antonio Mar√≠a de Bucareli y Urs√∫a in Mexico City, and his predecessor and now commandant-inspector Hugo Ocon√≥r. In 1772, the capital of Spanish Texas was officially moved to San Antonio. The next year, orders came to De Ripperd√° to remove the East Texan establishments back into the interior, now that there was no frontier to guard following the cession of Louisiana to Spain. However, to many of the Spanish of East Texas, Los Adaes was the only home most of them know, and many had married into French families. De Ripperd√° travelled to Los Adaes hoping he could prevent the abandonment but Ocon√≥r opposed him and he went away in deep disappointment. Over the next days, the planned expulsion of the Adaesians was put into practice, and many consequently died from hardship. Their leader, Antonio Gil Ybarbo, went to Mexico City in order to petition the Viceroy to allow them to return to their homes. Only after six years of wandering were they allowed to return as close as Nacogdoches, where they made a permanent settlement, thus ending one of Texas' most tragic dramas. One encouraging event in De Ripperd√°'s administration was the aid of Athanase de Mezieres in bringing the northern tribes under control. However, Ocon√≥r beclouded even this by casting suspicion on the work and belittling it, wrongly saying Ripperda favoured Frenchmen and engaged in illicit trade. As a result, the Viceroy ultimately forbade De Ripperd√° all communication with Louisiana and removed him from office for non- compliance in 1778. Although he had already appointed Governor of Honduras in 1776, De Ripperd√° and his family remained in Texas until 1778. Known as a true aristocrat and inveterate snob, he was nevertheless much respected and became known as one of the most popular Spanish Governors. On 28 June 1779, the King promoted him to the rank of brigadier-general. Baron de Ripperd√° died a disillusioned man.

White has to decide whether to force a draw by playing 20.Nxc5 Ra8 21.Qb7 Rb8 or to try to demonstrate the potential of the passed a-pawn, supported by two bishops, after 20.Nxc3 dxc3 which led to a position with mutual chances. 18...Rb5 19.Ne4 Ne5?

The island is located south of the island of Litlesotra, west of the Bergen Peninsula, north of the island of Tyss√∏yna, and east of the island of Sotra. Bjor√∏y is connected to the mainland city of Bergen by a subsea road tunnel called the Bjor√∏y Tunnel. It is also connected to the small island of Tyss√∏y in neighboring Sund municipality by a bridge. Bjor√∏y has 878 inhabitants (September 2012), and several hundred vacation cabins. History Due to its favourable location, proximity to Bergen, and the construction of the tunnel, the island has in recent years been seeing strong population growth. To prevent uncontrolled development, a building ban was instituted in 2007 but was later removed. The ban was instituted after a non-legally binding cap that only allowed ten new houses to be built on the island per year. The purpose was to ensure that the population growth did not surpass the growth of drinking water availability and kindergarten capacity (among other things), but the cap proved to be ineffective. Geography Map of Bjor√∏yna and its surroundings. Bjor√∏y is located in the Raunefjorden between the island of Store Sotra and Bergen. Although Bjor√∏y is connected only to Bergen by road, the island is part of √òygarden municipality. To get to the rest of the municipality, Bjor√∏y's residents must drive north into Bergen, then west over a bridge to get back to √òygarden. To the south of Bjor√∏y is the smaller island of Tyss√∏y. Tyss√∏y is connected to Bjor√∏y by a bridge which is in turn connected to Bergen by a tunnel. Transport The subsea tunnel Bjor√∏ytunnelen was opened in 1996, replacing the ferry between the island and Alv√∏en in Bergen. Plans for a tunnel connecting Bjor√∏y with Bergen were presented in the late 1980s. By the early 1990s, the island's population had been decreasing for several years, and the sole grocery store on the island closed in 1991. In 1993, the Norwegian government approved the plans for the tunnel, and construction began the same year. The construction of the tunnel proved challenging: the bedrock quality was worse than anticipated. Delayed by almost a year, the tunnel finally opened on 7 May 1996.

It is common for celebrities to help charitable causes by auctioning off a paid date with themselves to a loyal audience, which sees a great value in such a date.  History  With the rise of celebrity culture many people are willing to pay large sums to meet their favorite celebrity. For example, Scarlett Johansson auctioned a pair of tickets to attend her premiere, raising $40,100 for Oxfam.  Formats  The most common form of celebrity date auctions is through a charity fundraising event. These events are organized by charities or other parties and usually include dinner, speakers and other entertainment.

The various ministries therefore proposed that they themselves managed and issued orders to: *National Order of Agricultural Merit (French: \\"l'Ordre du M√©rite Agricole\\") 1883 *Order of Maritime Merit (French:\\"Ordre du M√©rite Maritime\\") 1930 *Order of the Social Merit (French:\\"Ordre du M√©rite social\\") 1936 *Order of Public Health (French:\\"Ordre de la Sant√© publique\\") 1938 *Orde of the Commercial Merit (French:\\"Ordre du M√©rite commercial\\") (1939) which was renamed in 1961 \\"Order of the Commercial and Industrial Merit\\". In 1940, a French government was formed in exile . They suggested a knighthood order as: *Order of Liberation established in 1940 by Charles de Gaulle in London. The France-remaining government of Marshal Philippe P√©tain, the so- called \\"Vichy government\\", proposed 2 knighthood orders: * National Order of Labour (French: \\"Ordre National Du Travail\\" 1942 * Order of the Francisque (French: \\"Ordre de la francisque\\") 1941  French Fourth Republic (1945‚Äì1958)  The Fourth Republic knew a very large quantity of knighthood orders and decorations. There were in 1945 16 knighthood orders. The traditional position of the Legion of Honour as highest and most prominent award remained formally intact but the French ministers founded for use in homeland and overseas no less than 11 new orders. *Legion of Honour 1802 *Order of Liberation 1940 The French ministries kept on establishing Ministerial Orders so there were finally 19 : *Order of the Public Instruction (Ordre de l‚ÄôInstruction Publique), 1866; renamed in 1955 to Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques (Order of the Academic Palms) *Order of Agricultural Merit (l'Ordre du M√©rite Agricole) 1883 *Order of Maritime Merit (Ordre du M√©rite Maritime) 1930 *Order of the Social Merit (Ordre du M√©rite social) 1936 *Order of Public Health (Ordre de la Sant√© publique) 1938 *Order of the Commercial Merit (Ordre du M√©rite commercial) 1939 *Order of the Artisanal Merit (Ordre du M√©rite artisanal) 1948 *Order of the Touristic Merit (Ordre du M√©rite touristique) 1949 *Order of the Postal Merit (France) (Ordre du M√©rite postal) 1953 *Order of the Warrior Merit (Ordre du M√©rite combattant) 1953 *Order of National Economy (Ordre de l'Economie nationale) 1954 *Order of the Sportive Merit (Ordre du M√©rite sportif) 1956 *Order of the Labour Merit (Ordre du M√©rite du Travail) 1957 *Order of the Military Merit (Ordre du M√©rite militaire) 1957 *Order of the Civil Merit (Ordre du M√©rite civil) 1957 *Order of Arts and Letters) (Ordre des Arts et des Lettres) 1957 *Order of the Saharian Merit (Ordre du M√©rite saharien) 1958 The French Republic knew following a decree of 1 September 1950 two \\"Orders of Overseas France\\" (Ordres de la France d'Outre-mer) : *Order of the Black Star 1889 *Order of the Star of Anjouan 1874 The two Orders were a heritage of the colonial time during which the decorations of the colonized states such as Dahomey and the Comores were included in the French orders system. The French government awarded the Order of the Black Star in Europe until 1 January 1964. The decolonisation and restructuring of the French colonial empire, one speaks now of the \\"French Union\\", made necessary other adaptations in the French knighthood orders. Three other colonial Orders incorporated in it since 1896, namely the Royal Order of Cambodia (Cambodja), the Order of the Dragon of Annam (Vietnam) and the Order of Nichan El-Anouar (Somaliland) became therefore on 1 September 1950 \\"Orders of Associated States of the French Union\\" (Ordres des √âtats Associ√©s de l'Union Fran√ßaise). The French government didn't award these honors themselves anymore. In 1963 the granting of the two French Overseas Orders were also discontinued. In their place, the new \\"National Order of Merit\\" was awarded. This Order replaced fifteen of the ministerial orders so that a much clearer decoration policy became possible.  French Fifth Republic (1958‚Äìpresent)  * Legion of Honour 1802 * Order of Liberation 1940 The 19 Ministerial Orders - which all knew three grades Commander, Officer and Knight - were each administered by a Board which was chaired by the relevant Minister. The fragmentation of the honors system was perceived as malpractice because a clear policy was not possible. Fifteen of these orders were abolished by the first president of the Fifth Republic, Charles de Gaulle on 1 January 1964 and were replaced by the National Order of Merit but the three following were kept: * Order of the Academic Palms (1808 or 1955) * National Order of Agricultural Merit (French: \\"l'Ordre National du M√©rite Agricole\\") * Order of Maritime Merit (French: \\"l'Ordre du M√©rite Maritime\\") The Order of Arts and Letters (French: \\"Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\\"), established in 1956, was also maintained. A new development is that on 5 June 1996, the Order of Tahiti Nui (French: \\"l'Ordre de Tahiti Nui\\") was established by the Assembly of French Polynesia (French: \\"Assembl√©e de Polyn√©sie fran√ßaise\\"), the local French Polynesian parliamentary assembly.

Finch is most notable as the player who scored an excellent solo try against the 1924 touring New Zealand 'Invincibles' in their match against Llanelli. Born Ernest Finch in Pembroke Dock to Abram and Emily Finch. His father was a retired police officer who upon moving to Wales and marrying Emily, his second wife, became a school board attendance monitor. Rugby career Finch first played senior rugby for local team Pembroke Dock Harlequins before moving to first class team Llanelli in 1922. Finch was first selected for Wales in the late game of the 1924 Five Nations Championship in an away game to France. Although Wales won, it was a messy Welsh performance caused by the decision of the Welsh Rugby Union officials to suspend Welsh player Ossie Male on the trip to Paris. The squad was thrown into turmoil, with several players being forced into unfamiliar positions. Finch managed to get his name on the scoreboard during the game when he scored one of two Welsh tries. Finch was re-selected for the next Welsh international, this time against the touring New Zealand team. Wales were completely outclassed and lost the game 19-0, and Finch would face the All Blacks just four days later as his Llanelli team played host to the tourists. The New Zealanders faced far stiffer opposition as Llanelli went on the offensive. The forwards tackled with ferocity and Llanelli may have won with better kicking accuracy. In the match, Finch scored Llanelli's only points with a memorable solo try. Finch took a quick line-out, took the returning ball and left Hart flat-footed as he sped past him. With the try line in sight the only All Black defender was George Nepia. As Nepia closed in, Finch stopped dead, Nepia paused and then threw a tackle which Finch dodged, leaving him a clear try line to score over.Billot (1972), pg 69-90. Finch was back in the Welsh squad in 1925 when he again faced France in the Five Nations Championship, this time in Wales at the Cardiff Arms Park. It was a more convincing Welsh performance and Finch scored two tries in an 11-5 victory. Finch held onto his place for the season's final Welsh international against Ireland, but found himself on the losing side against an impressive Irish team. In 1926 he played just one match, as part of Bobby Delahay's Welsh team to France, which Wales were narrow victors. Finch missed all off the 1927 Championship for Wales, but was selected to face the touring Waratahs towards the end of the season; and although Wales lost, Finch managed his fourth and final international try for his country. Finch's final game for his country was in 1928 in Paris and it saw the first Welsh defeat by the French team. Five players from the game never represented their country again, and Finch was one of them. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 466. * 1924, 1925, 1926 * 1925, 1928 * New South Wales Waratahs 1927 * 1924 Bibliography * * References Category:1899 births Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Rugby union wings Category:1983 deaths Category:Llanelli RFC players ","title":"Ernie Finch"},{"id":"20000861","text":" ","title":"Trisexuality"},{"id":"20000863","text":"Epp is a surname.

Temples are considered by church members to be the most sacred structures on earth. Upon completion, temples are usually open to the public for a short period of time (an \\"open house\\"). During the open house, the church conducts tours of the temple with missionaries and members from the local area serving as tour guides, and all rooms of the temple are open to the public. The temple is then dedicated as a \\"House of the Lord\\", after which only members who are deemed worthy are permitted entrance. Temples are not churches or meetinghouses designated for public weekly worship services, but rather are places of worship open only to the faithful where certain rites of the church must be performed. At present, there are temples in many U.S. states, as well as in many countries across the world. Several temples are at historical sites of the LDS Church, such as Nauvoo, Illinois, Palmyra, New York, and Salt Lake City, Utah. The importance of temples is often emphasized in weekly meetings, and regular participation in \\"temple work\\" is strongly encouraged for all Latter-day Saints (LDS). Within temples, members of the church make covenants, receive instructions, and perform sacred ceremonies and ordinances, such as baptism for the dead, washing and anointing (or \\"initiatory\\" ordinances), the endowment, and eternal marriage sealings. Ordinances are a vital part of the theology of the church, which teaches that they were practiced by the Lord's covenant people in all dispensations. Additionally, members consider the temple a place to commune with God, seek God's aid, understand the will of God, and receive personal revelation. LDS temple construction reached an all-time high in 2000. As of March 2016, there are 150 operating temples. Chart of temple construction as of April 2020 History =Biblical references= Latter Day Saints cite various Old Testament references to temple ordinances such as those found in , and . The words \\"HOLINESS TO THE LORD\\" can be found on LDS temples as referenced in . Likewise the Tabernacle was considered a \\"portable temple\\" by the children of Israel in the Old Testament. =Latter-day temples= The first Latter-day Saint temple ceremonies were performed in Kirtland, Ohio, but differed significantly from the endowment performed on the second floor of Joseph Smith's Red Brick Store in Nauvoo, Illinois, and the Nauvoo Temple. Kirtland ordinances included washings and anointings (differing in many ways from the modern portion) and the washing of the feet ordinance. For nearly four years, beginning in 1842, Smith's Red Brick Store functioned as a de facto temple‚Äîthe site of the first washings, anointings, endowments, and sealings. In contrast, the grand edifice known as the Nauvoo Temple was in operation for only two months before the Latter Day Saints left Illinois for the West. Preparations to initiate the first members of Smith's Quorum of the Anointed, or Holy Order, as it was also known, were made on May 3, 1842. The walls of the second level of the Red Brick Store were painted with garden- themed murals, the rooms fitted with carpets, potted plants, and a veil hung from the ceiling. All the while, the ground level continued to operate as Smith‚Äôs general mercantile. After the early events of the succession crisis, Brigham Young assumed control of the church's headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois. While he and the rest of the Quorum of the Twelve made contingency plans for abandoning the city, he may have hoped that it would not prove necessary. For example, in early 1845, Young convened a conference at the Norwegian colony at Norway, Illinois, and announced a plan to build a Latter- day Saint town there with a temple for the use of the Norwegian Latter Day Saints. Meanwhile, Young urged the Latter-day Saints in Nauvoo to redouble their efforts to finish the temple. By the end of 1845, the building was sufficiently finished to allow temple ordinances to be performed. Ordinances continued to be performed in early 1846 as the Mormons were forced to abandon the city. A small crew remained in the city and continued to work on the temple until April 30, 1846, when it was formally dedicated in a private ceremony by Joseph Young, the senior of the Seven Presidents of the Seventy. It was used for three months, then abandoned in late summer 1846. The completed temple was eventually destroyed by fire, and the remaining structure was later demolished by a whirlwind. The Frankfurt Germany Temple Upon reaching the Great Basin, Brigham Young began to build settlements based on the City of Zion plan and designated four of these to contain temples: Salt Lake City (1847), St. George (1871), Manti (1875), and Logan (1877). The St. George Temple was the first to be completed in 1877, followed by Logan (1884) and Manti (1888). The Salt Lake Temple took 40 years to complete because of various setbacks and delays. It was dedicated in 1893. Latter-day Saint temple building halted until the presidency of Joseph F. Smith, who announced two additional temples: Cardston, Alberta (1913), and LƒÅ, Hawaii (1915). Cardston became the first Latter-day Saint temple dedicated outside of the United States. Smith broke with the previous tradition (established since Kirtland) of building temples with upper and lower courts. Temples previously had been ever larger, but the Laie Hawaii Temple was smaller than the Nauvoo Temple had been. Both Cardston and Laie were dedicated under church president Heber J. Grant, as was a temple in Mesa, Arizona. George Albert Smith dedicated the next temple in Idaho Falls, Idaho. David O. McKay dedicated five additional temples including one in Bern, Switzerland‚Äîwhich was the first temple dedicated in Europe and the first temple to use film recording of the endowment rather than live actors. Joseph Fielding Smith dedicated a temple in Ogden, Utah and Harold B. Lee dedicated its twin in Provo, Utah. The Logan Utah Temple Spencer W. Kimball began a plan to build many more smaller temples according to standardized plans. Twenty-one temples were dedicated during his presidency, including the tiny Papeete Tahiti Temple‚Äîwhich has a floorspace of less than 10,000 square feet (900 m¬≤). This trend has continued. Nine additional temples were dedicated in the presidency of Ezra Taft Benson and two in the brief presidency of Howard W. Hunter. Under church president Gordon B. Hinckley, the church dedicated 77 temples. In 1997, Hinckley introduced a standardized, smaller temple plan designed to bring temple services to smaller or remote congregations at a reduced cost. The first of this new generation of temples was completed in 1998 with the Monticello Utah Temple. The original plan called for , later increased to . Subsequent revisions to the standard design further increased the size and complexity of the temples. The majority of the temples dedicated under Hinckley's tenure were of the smaller design, but one particularly noteworthy achievement was the rebuilding of the temple in Nauvoo, Illinois, known as the Nauvoo Illinois Temple. Hinckely's successor, Thomas S. Monson, dedicated 26 temples during his time as church president. His counselors in the First Presidency also dedicated a number of temples during Monson's administration. As of October 2018, Monson's successor and current church president, Russell M. Nelson, has dedicated the Concepci√≥n Chile Temple. The spires of the Salt Lake Temple at night Purposes Temples have a different purpose from LDS meetinghouses. Today, temples serve two main purposes: (1) Temples are locations in which worthy Latter-day Saints can perform sacred ordinances on behalf of themselves, their deceased ancestors, or unrelated deceased persons whose names are compiled from historical records through the church's Family Record Extraction Program. (2) Temples are considered to be houses of holiness where members can go to commune with God. Ezra Taft Benson, a former church president, taught: Such personal revelation can be received as needed, but many feel that it is easier to receive such revelation in a temple. Symbolism in the temple A doorknob of the Salt Lake Temple bearing an image of a beehive and carrying the inscription, \\"Holiness to the Lord\\" Many things in the temple are considered to be symbolic, from the clothing worn (those who attend the temple dress in white, a symbol of purity), to the architecture of the building and rooms, to the ceremonies themselves. Latter-day Saint temples are constructed with several symbolic elements meant to represent their religious theology. Each temple has the words \\"Holiness to the Lord\\" inscribed on it, the same inscription on the Old Testament Temple of Solomon. Most temples are built facing east, the direction from which Jesus Christ is prophesied to return. The spires and towers on the east end of multi-spired temples are elevated higher than spires and towers on the west side for this same reason, and to represent the Melchizedek, or higher, priesthood. Some temples, such as Salt Lake, Chicago, and Washington D.C., have triple spires on each side of the temple representing three different offices in both the Melchizedek and Aaronic priesthood. Stones carved with sun, moon, and earth or star designs are placed in ascending order around the Salt Lake Temple fa√ßade to represent the Latter- day Saint belief in a celestial, terrestrial, and telestial kingdom, or three degrees of glory, in the afterlife. However, they are arranged using the description of the woman found in Revelation 12:1 which says \\"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\\" A statue of the Angel Moroni, stands atop many temples built after the Salt Lake Temple. The statue design represents the Latter-day Saint belief that Moroni was the angel spoken of in Revelation 14. Temple ordinances The Laie Hawaii Temple is the fifth oldest Latter-day Saint temple and the first built outside the North American continent. It is also one of three temples designed to look like Solomon's Temple in scripture and one of the few temples without spires. LDS Church members perform rituals (termed ordinances) within temples. They are taught that temple ordinances are essential to achieving the condition of exaltation after the final judgment. They are also taught that a vast number of dead souls exist in a condition termed as spirit prison, and that a dead individual upon whom the temple ordinances are completed will have a chance to be freed of this imprisoning condition. In this framework ordinances are said to be completed on behalf of either the participant, or a dead individual the same sex as the participant (\\"on behalf of the dead\\" or \\"by proxy\\"). Ordinances performed in the temple include: * Baptism and confirmation on behalf of the dead * Melchizedek priesthood ordination on behalf of the dead * Washing and anointing (also known as the \\"Initiatory\\" ordinances) * The endowment * sealing ordinances (for opposite-sex couples and for parents and their children) Most ordinances are performed by proxy only on participants who have already completed the ordinance. Similarly, most ordinances are completed only one time for a participant in a lifetime and all subsequent temple ordinance participation is seen as acting for a dead individual. Baptism, confirmation, and priesthood ordination are usually performed in temples only when on behalf of the dead. The initiatory, endowment, and sealing ceremonies are today performed only within a temple. The sealing ordinance can be performed on behalf of dead couples; so long as the two living participants are of opposite sex they need not be married. It is also performed on behalf of living couples who wish to be legally married. In this manner, the ordinance is typically performed as a celestial marriage, with the idea the marriage bond lasts after their death, or for \\"time and all eternity\\". A \\"time only\\" modification can be made to the ordinance, such as when the surviving widow of a celestial marriage wishes to legally remarry. If children were born to the couple prior to the couple's sealing ceremony, the parents and the children may also be sealed together to form an eternal family unit. Children born to a couple after the sealing ceremony are considered to be automatically sealed to the parents, or \\"born in the covenant\\". In addition to the ordinances listed above, 19th century temples were host to other ordinances that are no longer practiced such as the baptism for health and baptism for renewal of covenants. In 1922, Heber J. Grant discontinued the practice of baptisms for health in the church. The Second anointing is a rare, but currently practiced ordinance for live participants, and (less commonly) vicariously for deceased individuals, though, it is usually only given in absolute secrecy to a small number of members after a lifetime of service. Entrance requirements The Washington D.C. Temple is the 16th Latter-day Saint temple. The Preston England Temple, located outside Chorley, Lancashire, England. The LDS Church booklet \\"Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple\\" explains that Latter-day Saints \\"do not discuss the temple ordinances outside the temples.\\" Further, the booklet states: To enter the temple, an individual must be baptized, and after one year, may seek a temple recommend. The individual is interviewed by his/her bishop, during which the candidate is asked a series of questions to determine worthiness to enter the temple. The individual is also interviewed by his or her stake president. The bishop and stake president sign the recommend, indicating their approval of that member's worthiness. The individual also signs the recommend, acknowledging the responsibility to remain worthy to hold the recommend. Most recommends are valid for two years. =Worthiness interview= To qualify for a temple recommend, an LDS Church member must faithfully answer a series of questions which affirm the individual's adherence to essential church doctrine. The questions address the following:\\"Church Updates Temple Recommend Interview Questions\\", churchofjesuschrist.org, 6 October 2019. * Faith in and testimony of God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. * Testimony of the atonement of Jesus Christ and his role as Savior and Redeemer. * Testimony of the restoration of the gospel. * Support of the President of the Church and his authority, and other general authorities and local church leaders. * Moral cleanliness in thoughts and actions. * Obeying the law of chastity. * Following teachings of the church in public and private behavior with family members and others. * Refraining from supporting or promoting any teaching, practice, or doctrine that conflicts with church doctrine. * Making a good faith effort to keep the Sabbath Day holy; attend meetings; prepare for and worthily partake of the sacrament; live life in accordance with the laws and commandments of the gospel. * Honesty in everything. * Paying a full tithe. * Understanding and obeying the Word of Wisdom. * Payment of and keeping current on child support or alimony, if applicable. * If already received the endowment, keeping the covenants made in the temple and wearing the temple garment as instructed in the temple. * Making a full confession of any serious sins to church leaders. * Regarding oneself worthy to enter the temple and participate in ordinances therein. ;Further reading Edward L. Kimball (1998). \\"The History of LDS Temple Admission Standards\\". Journal of Mormon History 24 (1): 135-176\\\\. * =History of interview questions= A list of questions were first introduced in 1857 and used to qualify whether an individual could enter the Endowment House, before the first temple in Utah was built. They reflected the context of the times, including questions about branding an animal that you did not own and using another person's irrigation water. Since then, the temple recommend questions have changed significantly, though less so in recent years. * In 1996, the first question about a belief in God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost was split into three questions. A second question was modified to ask if the member sustained the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve as prophets, seers, and revelators. The question about wearing the garments was qualified, added a clause about wearing them as instructed in the temple. * In 1999, a simplified question about financial obligations was asked of all members, not just divorced members. * In 2012, the question about wearing the garments was slightly modified to clarify that the garments should not be worn separately. * In October 2019's general conference, church president Russell M. Nelson announced revisions to the temple recommend questions. In addition to some clarifications and streamlining, the question about the law of chastity now includes \\"striving for moral cleanliness\\" in thoughts and behavior. The question about attending church meetings was expanded to include a more general question about Sabbath observance. =Types of recommends= The standard Temple Recommend authorizes a member who has been baptized at least one year prior to take part in all temple ordinances and is valid for two years. A Recommend for Living Ordinances is given to individuals who are participating in the endowment for the first time, being sealed to a spouse, or anyone being married in the temple for time only. It may only be used in conjunction with a standard Temple Recommend.. A Limited-use Recommend is available to members who have not yet received their endowment or who have not been a member for one year. These may also be issued to a group for a single visit to the temple. These can be issued to youth 11 and older who will take part in baptism and confirmations for the dead, to single members age 8‚Äì20 who are preparing to be sealed to their parents, or for individuals, not endowed, who wish to observe specific ordinances. The church member must meet the same worthiness standards as a standard temple recommend in an interview with the member's bishop. Unlike the standard temple recommend, a limited-use recommend does not require a year's membership nor an interview with a stake president. A limited-use recommend is only valid for proxy baptisms and confirmation ordinances. =Emergency access= Those without recommends occasionally need to enter temples after dedication during fires, medical emergencies, or building inspections. They are escorted by temple personnel during such visits. Temples may offer introductory tours to new local firefighters and emergency medical technicians during regularly scheduled maintenance periods. Omaha, Nebraska Temple weddings The LDS temple wedding is a process which culminates in the participation by the couple in a ritual called the sealing ordinance; which involves pronouncing the couple as having a permanent marriage bond which persists even beyond death. This ceremony, among others, is taught as being vital to an individual's and family's exaltation status, following the final judgment. With the sealing ordinance being held inside a temple, only church members in good standing who have a valid temple recommend are permitted to attend the ceremony. In many nations outside the United States, a civil ceremony, where required by the law of the land, has been immediately followed by a temple sealing. In the United States, a one-year waiting period between the civil ceremony and a temple sealing was required until 2019. In May 2019, to standardize sealing policies on a global scale, church leaders announced an end to the one-year waiting period in most cases, except in relation to converts to the church, who are still required to wait a year after their own confirmation before entering the temple. Receptions after the temple ceremony, or engagement parties before the temple marriage, can be attended by anyone, since they are typically held at locations such as local LDS meetinghouses, homes, other churches, or other public venues.

Distribution The historical range of Juglans hindsii is from the San Joaquin Valley and Sacramento Valley to the Inner Northern California Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area, in Northern California. The tree grows in riparian woodlands, either in mono-species stands, or mixed with California oak species (Quercus spp.) and Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) trees. ;Conservation Juglans hindsii has only one confirmed native stand remaining. It is listed as Seriously Endangered on the California Native Plant Society Rare Plant Inventory.California Native Plant Society Rare Plant Inventory: Juglans californica . accessed 10.1.2013 The IUCN classification is a Vulnerable species. It is threatened by hybridization with orchard trees, urbanization, and habitat conversion to agriculture. Description Juglans hindsii is a medium-sized tree of short bulky proportions. It grows up to tall, has a single erect trunk, commonly without branches for , and a crown that can be wider than the tree is tall. Trunks commonly reach in diameter near the base of the tree. The leaf is approximately long, with 13-21 leaflets per leaf, each 2-5\\" long, with dentate margins. Unlike the Southern California walnut, the vein angles bear tufts of hair. The nut has a smooth, brown, thick shell, that contains a small edible nutmeat.Kershner, Mathews, Nelson, and Spellenberg, National Wildlife Federation field Guide to Trees of North America, 2008, Chanticleer Press, Inc. p. 229 Allergenicity Hind's Walnut (Juglans hindsii) is a severe allergen. Pollination: Occurs in following seasons depending on latitude and elevation: Spring. Uses =Cultivation= Juglans hindsii has been commercially important as a rootstock for orchard stock of Juglans regia (English walnut) trees all over the world. It is also used as a parent to the fast-growing Luther Burbank hybrid rootstock, commonly called \\"Paradox\\" (Juglans hindsii x Juglans regia).UC Davis Nut Production: Walnut Rootstock & Scion Selection . Biology and Technology of Fruit & Nut Production . accessed 10.1.2013 ;Ornamental tree The Northern California walnut is cultivated by specialty California native plant nurseries. It is used as an ornamental tree in traditional and wildlife gardens, and for habitat gardens, natural landscaping projects, and climate compatible drought tolerant gardens. The tree is also planted in habitat restoration projects.  Pests  Juglans hindsii is infested by Rhagoletis juglandis, commonly known as the walnut husk fly, which lays its eggs in the husks of walnut fruit. R. juglandis infests other varieties of walnut trees as well, such as Juglans regia (the English or Persian walnut), Juglans rupestris (a species of walnut indigenous to Arizona and Texas), and Juglans hindsii (the California black walnut).Boyce, A.M.

Some confusion exists about the nature of claro walnut because Juglans hindsii is commonly used as the rootstock of orchard trees. The section below the original graft is claro walnut wood, while the section above is the lighter-colored English walnut. Some woodworkers take advantage of this by making the color change a feature of their work.Mcfaddenfurniture.com: 'armoire' Taxonomy The current classification of the plant is as a distinct species.

The protocol takes advantages of the multichannel scheme defined in WAVE and uses the Control Channel (CCH) for signalling, and relies on one of the multiple Service Channels (SCHs) for payload data dissemination. Protocol design Stack of WAVE with VRR The Vehicular Reactive Routing (VRR) protocol is integrated with the WAVE stack and is embedded at the Logic Link Control layer. VRR is a multi-channel protocol which exercises efficient route discovery, route maintenance and data deliver processes with the use of the Control Channel (CCH) and a Service Channel (SCH). Standard WSA messages are transmitted over CCH and IPv6 packets are transmitted over SCH. To obtain a current neighbour location the WSA frame is modified to carry position information (incurs an additional 4 Bytes). Route request and route reply demands are transmitted inside WSA frames (additional 40 Bytes) over the Control Channel and data acknowledgment and all application data (IPv6 packets) are sent over the Service Channel. Due to these modifications, a route is firstly established over the CCH and afterwards data are transmitted over the SCH. VRR Protocol Messages The VRR protocol uses 3 signalling message types. Messages, route request (RREQ) and route reply (RREP) are broadcast on the CCH and acknowledgment (ACK) packets are transmitted on the SCH. Data packets are IPv6 packets and are transmitted after route discovery or route maintenance on one of SCHs. RREQ and RREP are situated inside the WRA field of WSA frame and on each hop the WSA frame is discarded and a new WSA frame created. Both messages are transmitted in the lowest Traffic Class (background). VRR Broadcasting This algorithm is based on combination of three approaches * Neighbour elimination family: receiving nodes themselves decide to rebroadcast data or not on base of network coverage. If all nodes in transmit range of receiver node are covered by the information, then the receiver node does not rebroadcast. If some node is not covered by the information in transmit range of the node then the node prepares data to rebroadcast. * Source-dependent dominating sets: The principle is that a sender determines for a small subset of neighbours which is called multipoint relay (MPR). Only nodes inside the subset can rebroadcast information from the source. * Probability: where probability depending on the distance between a transmitter and a receiver. A Higher probability is chosen for node further from a source and vice versa with a lower probability for closer nodes. Principle of VRR Broadcasting simply like that: A transmitter sends a broadcast data. * If receiving node is chosen as MPR node by transmitter, it sets up shortest backoff time (waiting time before rebroadcasting). * If receiving node is not chosen as MPR node by transmitter, it sets up backoff time depend on its mobility behaviour (distance from a transmitter, speed and vector of motion). * If receiving node calculates that its neighbour's nodes are already covered by broadcast information, then the node doesn't rebroadcast. An advantage of VRR Broadcasting approach is that all receiving nodes have some opportunity to rebroadcast information (not only MPR nodes), but only a few nodes have the best opportunity (i.e. the shortest backoff time) for rebroadcasting. Another advantage is that in the case of the multipoint relay node not always receiving the broadcast due to collisions (in a dense busy network) then other nodes who overhear can transmit the information instead. Route discovery technique The RREQ frames are broadcast by the VRR Broadcasting algorithm. If a node doesn't have a route to destination then the node rebroadcasts depend on the algorithm. If a node has a route to destination, it creates broadcast frame RREP and set up backoff time depend on mobility behaviour (distance from a transmitter, speed and vector of motion). If a RREP is transmitted by a transmitter, all neighbour's nodes received also the RREP and they discards own RREQ or RREP effort except node which is on a way to a source node.

For his service to the poor, he was awarded the Legion of Honor. Early life Opeka was born in Argentina, in San Mart√≠n, a suburb of Buenos Aires, to Argentine Slovene parents.http://famvin.org/wiki/Pedro_Opeka Vincentian Encyclopedia: Pedro Opeka, CM His father was from Begunje pri Cerknici, his mother from Velike La≈°ƒçe in Lower Carniola;.http://www.slovenskenovice.si/novice/slovenija/oce- pedro-je-oce-dobrih-prijateljev His father was a former member of the Home Guard, a Slovenian anti-communist German-led auxiliary police force, and avoided post-war summary executions by fleeing to Italy. He met his future wife in a refugee camp in Italy, where they married. They emigrated together to Argentina to avoid the Yugoslav communist regime. Pedro grew up in the streets of Buenos Aires. Very early as a child, from the age of 9, he worked with his father as a bricklayer. At 15, he hesitated between becoming a football professional and a priest. He eventually decided to become a priest and enter the seminary of the Lazarists in Buenos Aires. At 20, he went to Ljubljana in Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia), to further his training. Two years later, In 1970, he went to Madagascar where he worked as a bricklayer in the parishes of the Lazarists. He finished his studies at the Catholic Institute of Paris (1972-1975), where he learnt French. He met the Taiz√© Community near Cluny in France, who have their members supporting communities in 24 major cities around the globe, and travelled all over Europe. Pedro Opeka speaks 7 languages: Spanish, Slovenian, English, French, Italian, Latin and Malagasy. Mission in Madagascar On 28 September 1975, Pedro Opeka was ordained priest in Buenos Aires and was nominated to head a rural parish in southeast Madagascar, Vangaindrano. In 1989, his Lazarist superiors nominated him director of a seminary in Antananarivo, the capital. When he saw a dump from the hills of the city, he discovered people rummaging among garbage to find something to eat, and sleeping in huts made of hemp propped between mountains of waste. Pedro Opeka began talking to them, to convince them that they could leave that misery and abuse, for their children. With the team of young people from Vangaindrano he had trained, and after long discussions, he wrote the articles and statutes of Akamasoa ('good friends' in the local language) in December 1989. Father Pedro simply had no money and started it all with 900‚Ç¨ he borrowed from various Christian missions. Father Pedro in the rubbish dump. =Creation of Akamasoa= Father Pedro Opeka created a local non-governmental organization called Akamasoa (the good and faithful friends) in December 1989 to continue his work with the Malagasy people. He appointed a team of staff to help him to manage the daily activities and to provide continuous support to poor people. Today Akamasoa sustains about thirty thousand people in 18 villages, among them ten thousand children, who all go to school, following the building of 37 new schools in the years since Akamasoa's founding. About four thousand families live in the 18 villages, but another 900,000 Malagasy people have been supported from one day to three weeks in the 'welcome centers', being offered rice, a roof, some clothing and a small package, in order to be 'born again' to life. Son of a courageous father who taught him building arts, Father Pedro Opeka taught the Akamasoa youth how to build houses, first out of wood, and then, bricks and mortar. Over 3,000 solid houses have been built by Akamasoa to date for people who used to live in card-board boxes on the ground...Every year, Akamasoa builds new schools, clinics, and training and production centres. Over 3,600 jobs have been created for the villagers, who are paid by Akamasoa every month. A comprehensive economic structure, Akamasoa has grown to being 75% self- sufficient in revenue, thanks to the creation of stone and gravel quarries, to the craft and embroidery workshops, and to a compost centre next to the 'Tana' public rubbish. Father Pedro Opeka taught the Akamasoa people tips on how to divide and sort the rubbish, to transport the compost created from rubbish, and to create small agricultural farms. Akamasoa also trains construction artisans (bricklayers, carpenters, cabinet makers, operators and street pavers) who have built or rebuilt roads and bridges to help communities in the villages and all over the country... Akamasoa lies about 12 km from the center of Antananarivo, on the road to Tamatave. Awards In 2007, Opeka was named a knight of the Legion of Honor.http://famvin.org/en/archive/pedro-opeka-cm- named-member-of-the-french-legion-of-honor Pedro Opeka, CM named member of the French Legion of Honor The award, decreed on 12 October by the President of France, recognizes his 20 years of public service to the poor in Antananarivo.

Founded in 1998, the company was run by Geoff Beckett Jr., Lance Buttiglieri, and Bill Roshia and was based in Ridgewood, New Jersey. In 2012 Beckett rebranded the company as GBJR Toys and began raising money for the company through fundraising sites. It has since come under fire for allegedly using licenses without permission and failing to deliver product as promised. Beckett, however, has claimed that GBJR toys is in no way associated with Shocker Toys. History Shocker Toys was founded in 1998 in Buffalo, New York by Geoff Beckett Jr. Beckett had previously worked in construction and claims he was inspired to venture into the toy industry while \\"playing games with his brother\\". The company operated primarily on the Internet, and by 2002 the company had two full-time employees: CEO Beckett and Marketing Director Dana Newsom. Shocker Toys relocated twice prior to 2002, moving to Glen Rock, New Jersey in 2000 before relocating to Ridgewood, New Jersey. During this early period, the company's primary focus was on card games featuring characters developed by Beckett. However, these card games were never brought to market. Instead, the company began to focus on developing action figures, and in 2004 they released their first product: the Shockini block figure. According to Shocker Toys, this was a significant year for the company, as it was also the year in which Shocker Toys was incorporated and Beckett was joined by Lance Buttiglieri as a new partner. Subsequent to Buttiglieri joining the company, Shocker Toys continued to develop the Shockinis line, and in 2006 displayed the figures at the American International Toy Fair. While Shocker Toys became \\"best known for being plagued by delays and other problems\\", the company released the first series of Indie Spotlight figures and the \\"Mallow\\" line of marshmallow-themed figures in 2009. In January 2010, Dave Ryan was named Shocker Toys' first sales agent.Comic Related - Dave Ryan@Shocker Toys In May 2011, Shocker Toys was accused of nonpayment for work done for them by artist Tony Robles and then attempted to have the artist's website shut down by Robles' domain host using legal threats. During the Shocker Toys panel at the 2011 Comic-Con International: San Diego, court papers were served to Geoff Beckett by Jim MacQuarrie on behalf of Robles. In late 2011, Shocker Toys announced that the company had new partners and that they had undergone a change in ownership. One of the new owners of Shocker Toys is Eric Nyenhuis, the current owner of GLOW (Gorgeous Ladies Of Wrestling).http://www.infinitehollywood.com/2012/03/glow-wrestling-and- shocker-toys.html Packaging mock-ups of GLOW action figures bearing the Shocker Toys logo have been shown online.http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.304657926260006.70772.273227522736380&type;=1 During the first half of 2012, Geoff Beckett rebranded the company as GBJRToys, through which he now holds the licenses to make Indie Spotlight and Mallow figures.http://www.linkedin.com/in/shockertoys According to Geoff Beckett, he quit GBJR Toys in December 2015 and sold it to new owners. https://www.facebook.com/gbjrtoyshttps://twitter.com/GBJRTOYS The Shocker Toys/GBJR Toys website remains registered in his name. http://web.horde.ws/shockertoys.com Products =Shockinis= Debuting in 2004, Shockinis were the company's first product to be released. Shockinis were 3 inch action figures intended for customization, with multiple points of articulation. Geoff Beckett has stated that while there are many similar toy lines ‚Äì including Kubricks, Pocket Heroes, and Minimates ‚Äì Shockinis, and their predecessor, Stikfas, are the only two designed specifically for customization. Beckett has differentiated Shockinis from Stikfas on the basis that Shockinis were \\"conceived in the USA\\" and were available as preassembled figures rather than as model kits. Different versions of Shockinis, including a Toxic Avenger Shockini, Kade from Arcana comics and other comic book convention exclusives were sold online, at conventions, and through a few comic book shops in limited runs of 50 to 1000 pieces. No new Shockinis have been produced since 2006. =Indie Spotlight= In 2006, Shocker Toys started work on Indie Spotlight, a line of six-inch action figures based on characters from various independent comic book series. The first series consisted of Katchoo from Terry Moore's Strangers in Paradise, Scud and Sol from Rob Schrab's Scud: The Disposable Assassin, the Maxx from Sam Kieth's series of the same name, David Mack's Kabuki and two different versions of Jim Valentino's Shadowhawk. A small figurine of an Isz was included with each figure, as well as other, character specific accessories. Plans to include a comic book or poster packed in with each figure, similar to the packaging of Toybiz's Marvel Legends figures, were announced but later abandoned. Shocker Toys also announced a \\"mail away\\" figure of Mr. Gone from The Maxx, available to customers who purchase all seven figures in the first series. This figure has yet to be made available, however a sculpt did appear at the 2010 Toy Fair. Development of the Indie Spotlight series encountered several problems, among them Marvel Toys' 2007 release of their own line of action figures including independent comic book characters announced for the Shocker Toys line. Prototypes of Indie Spotlight Series 1 were displayed at the 2007 American International Toy Fair, and new versions of that series were shown at the following year's show and at the San Diego Comic-Con ‚Äì the latter also including Series 2 prototypes. Following numerous announced (and subsequently missed) release dates, the first series of Indie Spotlight action figures was available for purchase online as of April 2009. In February, 2011, a limited run, preview edition of The Tick from the planned second series of Indie Spotlight figures was released, along with a \\"Mucus Tick\\" variant produced as an exclusive for the Idle Hands website. As of 2014, GBJR Toys no longer has the right to produce any further Tick related figures. =Limited convention exclusives= Shocker Toys has produced a number of convention exclusives over the years. These include a Gwar \\"Beefcake\\" statue, a 3\\" Maxx vinyl figurine for the San Diego Comic-Con, and a Scud statue for the New York Comic Con. Shocker Toys also released a pair of statues and a box set of five vinyl figures based on the fictional band Dethklok from the Adult Swim series Metalocalypse as San Diego Comic-Con exclusives. The box sets of vinyl figures were limited to 500 pieces and sold at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, the subsequent 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, and the 2009 Wizard World Chicago Comic Con. At the 2009 New York Comic Con, Shocker Toys had planned to sell two translucent versions of their then-forthcoming Scud and Maxx figures from the Indie Spotlight line. The figures were unavailable for the event, but were shipped out to customers roughly a month later, starting on March 3, 2009. A similar variant was offered at the Wizard World convention in Philadelphia that year, with a transparent Maxx incorporating painted highlights. At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, Shocker Toys offered figures based on their forthcoming Indie Spotlight Series 2 ‚Äì a \\"black and white\\" Dick Tracy figure and a trench-coated variant. At the same event, convention exclusive Mallows also debuted, including Dr. Rockso, the Phantom, and an SDCC Guy. Convention exclusives have also been sold through their website, and unsold figures have subsequently been made available at later conventions. =Mallows= In 2009, Shocker Toys started a new line of marshmallow themed figures called \\"Mallows.\\" Similar to Hasbro's Mighty Muggs and Kidrobot's Munny and Dunny figures, Mallows feature multiple points of articulation, interchangeable parts, and are available in blank, black or white, do-it-yourself versions. Cancelled or unreleased items =Card games= Shocker Toys first planned products were card games featuring characters developed by Beckett. Despite promoting them online, none of the card games were brought to market. Beckett cited cost fixing by competitors as the cause. =Manga= Using characters from the unreleased card games, the company turned its attention to developing an \\"American Manga magazine\\". The magazine was never published, but the characters developed for the stories lead to the company's next effort. =Shoulder Action Figures= After its attempts at manga creation and publication, the company changed direction to focus on the production of action figures. In 2002 Shocker Toys displayed prototypes of their Shoulder Action Figures, or SAFs, at the \\"Christmas in July\\" event in New York run by public relations firm Steven Style Group. In spite of early publicity for the concept, the product was never released, with Beckett citing problems arising from outsourcing as the cause. The company's attention then shifted to developing the Shockini line of action figures. =Mutant Mania Shockinis= Shocker Toys announced a line of \\"mutant and monster\\" Shockinis in October 2004, for release the following February. Aside from a Toxic Avenger Shockini which was released as a convention exclusive, no other figure from the line was released.http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/2662/got-some-toy-news-for-all- you-collectors/ =Other Licensed Shockinis= Shockinis based on characters from Bucky O'Hare, Gwar, 2000AD (including Judge Dredd), Metalocalypse, the Indie Spotlight line, and Who Wants to be a Superhero? were announced as early as 2005. Other than the Toxic Avenger and Kade from Arcana comics, no other licensed properties were produced as Shockinis. =Gwar= Shocker Toys acquired the license to produce toys based on the band Gwar, releasing a 500 piece run, resin statue of the band member Beefcake as a San Diego Comic-Con exclusive in 2006. However, the announced line of articulated PVC Gwar action figures was canceled before reaching the market. The proposed replacement line of vinyl Gwar figures was never released. =Metalocalypse= In 2007, Shocker Toys acquired a license to the characters in the fictional band Dethklok from the Adult Swim series Metalocalypse. The announced regular retail line of Metalocalypse figures was never released, although San Diego Comic-Con exclusives were sold in 2008 and again in 2009, including Dr. Rockzo as a Mallow designer figure in a limited run of 500 pieces.

The centre was operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and formally closed in November 2015. Dover has been designated as an historic site by English Heritage.  History  The Western Heights of Dover are one of the most impressive fortifications in Britain. They comprise a series of forts, strong points and ditches, designed to protect the country from invasion. They were created to augment the existing defences and protect the key port of Dover from both seaward and landward attack. There have been fortifications here since Roman times, but fortifications built for defense from the French in the days of Napoleon house the buildings there today. The Prison Service took over the site from the British Army in 1952 when work began on converting the fortress into a prison. In 1957, the prison was converted into a Borstal, also operating as a Young Offenders Institution until April 2002, when Detention Centre Rules 2001 converted it into an Immigration Removal Centre. The site then held male adult detainees aged 18 and over who were appealing for asylum or had failed in seeking it. The centre offered residential space with integral sanitation as well as resources such as televisions and telephones. It provided shared resources including gym, a library, church, mosques, multi-faith rooms, shops, laundry facilities, and a healthcare unit. In October 2015 the Home Office announced that the centre would close by the end of the month, with all remaining detainees being transferred to other removal centres. The site was then passed over to the Ministry of Justice.

Ralph Clanton (September 11, 1914 - December 29, 2002) was an American character actor. His most seen performance was Comte De Guiche in the 1950 film Cyrano de Bergerac, the first sound version in English of Edmond Rostand's play, and the film for which Jos√© Ferrer won his only Academy Award for Best Actor. Besides Ferrer as Cyrano, Clanton was the only holdover from the cast of the 1946 Broadway revival of the play, and would play the role of De Guiche opposite him once more, in a New York City Center production in 1953. He also appeared in the British war film They Were Not Divided.(1950). Clanton was featured in seven episodes of Alfred Hitchcock's television show, as well as making several appearances on the Hallmark Hall of Fame. In 1976, he played the role of George Washington in a PBS television production of Sidney Kingsley's drama The Patriots. He also played Jasper Delaney on the TV soap operas, Another World and its spinoff Somerset. He played Mr. Ingram in the sci-fi thriller The 27th Day. He played guest star roles on numerous television series, such as four episodes of Perry Mason, including the role of Mervyn Aldritch in the premiere episode, \\"The Case of the Restless Redhead\\" in 1957, murder victim Charles Brewster in \\"The Case of the Fancy Figures\\" in 1958 and Karl Colby in \\"The Case of the Stand-in Sister\\" in 1962. In addition, he appeared on Broadway in the role of Claude Nau in Robert Bolt's Vivat! Vivat Regina!, as well as in several Shakespeare productions. One of his last roles was a bit part in the film Trading Places (1983). In a playbill for the 1946 revival of Cyrano de Bergerac he is listed as a direct descendant of members of the infamous Clanton gang, which took part in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

He hides his identity from her and grew up with the influence of a police officer until he is ready to find her in the present day to meet her. But when gangsters chase Swetha and Vijay at the hospital, Vijay was forced to fight and kill some of Ajay's goons in front of Swetha which made her scared of him on the way he fights ruthlessly and grimly.

Due to these appeals, ‚ÄúAmerican presidents have been able to impart a positive value to [the nation‚Äôs wars] as well as justify the nation‚Äôs involvement.\\"Bass, Jeff D. ‚ÄúBass, Jeff D. ‚ÄúThe Rhetorical Opposition to Controversial Wars: Rhetorical Timing as a Generic Consideration.‚Äù The Western Journal of Speech Communication 43‚Äù (Summer 1979): 180-191. By understanding the persuasiveness of these appeals, Reid believes one can better understand wartime behavior. Biography Ronald F. Reid, a Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst at Amherst, retired in 1991 after 32 years of teaching.University of Massachusetts Amherst Obituaries, ‚ÄúUMASS Chronicles‚Äù.

Territorial appeals Territorial appeals ‚Äútaps into the ‚Äòlower‚Äô instincts we share with the animal kingdom.\\"Donald, Ralph. ‚ÄúAn Appeal to Fear Ain‚Äôt Nothin‚Äô New: George W. Bush‚Äôs Middle East War Rhetoric and Territoriality in American Propaganda Films of World War II.‚Äù American Studies Today 16 (2007): 18-27. As most animal species ‚Äúmark off units of physical space‚Äù as ‚Äútheirs‚Äù and will fight to retain that space, ‚Äúmany countries, led by the U.S., have developed a global sense of territoriality.‚Äù As a result, nations ‚Äúregard physical space as property‚Äù and are prepared to defend that property. The object of the territorial appeal is gain support for war by convincing the audience that the country is in danger. Countries are more willing to support war when they feel their land is threatened. Just as ‚Äúa defending animal‚Äôs willingness to fight correlates with the extent to which its territory is invaded,‚Äù a human's willingness to fight correlates with the extent to which his country is threatened. =Expansionism= Territorial appeals are often used to portray ‚Äúexpansionism as defensive by depicting it as a response to an existing outside threat or honorable effort to recover territory‚Äù that was unfairly taken. Thus, through territorial appeal, ‚Äúeven unjustified American imperialism‚Ä¶can be characterized as defensive.‚Äù =Encroachment appeals= Encroachment appeals are reminiscent of the domino theory. By ‚Äúnarrating recent ‚Äòencroachments‚Äô along the frontier,‚Äù the orator proposes these seemingly isolated attacks are part of a bigger takeover conspiracy. =Metaphysical appeals= There are some ideas/virtues countries assume as property. ‚ÄúA populace may be motivated to embark upon a course of war because of the threat posed to its national ideals by a competing ideology.\\" Therefore, an orator can demonstrate a metaphysical territorial appeal by showing a threat to these ideals. Ethnocentric appeals The Ethnocentric Appeal states that if the individuals in a culture belong and identify to it, they are likely to think their culture is superior to other cultures. Ordinary ethnocentricity tends to lead those of a culture to ignore \\"outsiders.\\" The Ethnocentric Appeal concentrates on creating an ‚ÄòUs vs. Them‚Äô mentality. According to ethnocentricity, individuals often see their culture as superior to others. Therefore, when an orator is able to ‚Äúestablish a ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô image of the enemy's savagery,‚Äù he ‚Äúeliminate[s] peace as a viable alternative to war.\\"Ivie, Robert L. ‚ÄúThe Metaphor of Force in Prowar Discourse: The Case of 1812.‚Äù Quarterly Journal of Speech 68 (1982): 240-253. For example, during the American Revolution, the government told the people \\"God's plan of history called for progress, and the Revolution was an integral part of that plan.\\"Reid, Ronald F. \\"Varying Historical Interpretations of the American Revolution:Some Rhetorical Perspectives.\\" Communication Quarterly 23(2) (Spring 1975): 5-15. This sets up the notion that \\"they\\" were \\"evil\\" and we are \\"good\\" because God is on our side. =Emotional intensity= Pro-war rhetoric must \\"arouse ethnocentrism to a high level of emotional intensity.\\" To achieve this: # The outsider must be hated. To create hatred, orators use ‚Äúdecivilizing vehicles ‚Äì including references to acts of nature, mechanized processes, predaceous animals, barbarous actions, and violent crimes.\\" # The opposing culture must be shown as a possible threat, using \\"intense language which exploits the most basic and strongly held cultural values.\\" By making the opposing culture appear threatening, people of the \\"superior culture\\" will have more reason to be defensive. Appeals to optimism An Appeal to Optimism creates the illusion war is not bad and that it has its positives. This can be achieved in four ways: # By controlling the news, don't tell the public what is going poorly.Procter, David E. ‚ÄúThe Rescue Mission: Assigning Guilt to a Chaotic Scene.‚Äù The Western Journal of Speech Communications 51 (1987): 245-255. # Don't give the impression of being unprepared. # Show we‚Äôre stronger than our ‚Äúenemy‚Äù through our ‚Äúnation‚Äôs material strengths.\\" # Use scapegoats to blame for wartime losses; ‚Äúwhen the scapegoats are removed, victory will follow.\\" Reagan's war on drugs ‚Äúabsolve[d] individuals of direct blame for their addictions and instead concentrate[d] on substances and nebulous ‚Äòdrug criminals‚Äô as the enemies.\\"Elwood, William N. ‚ÄúDeclaring War on the Home Front: Metaphor, Presidents, and the War on Drugs.‚Äù Metaphor and Symbolic Activity 10(2) (1995): 93-114. Also, this is trying to show the audience that we are winning the war in different ways. This appeal uses spiritual phrases and phrases that show the strength of the military. ‚ÄúThe necessity of protecting [a country's] ideals ‚Äòtranscends limited human powers'.\\" This appeal is intended to instill hope and confidence for a victory in the audience's mind. Appeals to war aims War Aims support former appeals and provide an ending goal for the war. Missions ‚Äúrhetorically create the sense of an objective response.\\" Nations want to bring about more peace and security. For example, the war aims for security protect from future territorial threats of enemies. Permanent peace will ensure security. If ‚Äúthe aim is total overthrow of the enemy,‚Äù the language is ambiguous, unclear, and utopian. For example, ‚ÄúWe seek to create a massive change.\\" If the ‚Äúaims reflects a desire for security,‚Äù the language expresses clear anticipated results. Presidents will ‚Äúdefine an issue [and] the possible resolutions to that issue.\\" References Category:Rhetoric Category:Rhetoric theorists Category:University of Massachusetts Amherst faculty ","title":"Ronald Reid's Three Topoi"},{"id":"20001331","text":"Deurali, Ramechhap is a village development committee in Ramechhap District in the Janakpur Zone of north-eastern Nepal.

Life  Pietro Zeno was the son of the Venetian bailo at Negroponte, also named Pietro Zeno. In early 1384 he married Petronilla Crispo, daughter of Francesco I Crispo, tenth Duke of the Archipelago, as part of the latter's attempt to secure Venetian recognition of his usurpation of the ducal throne after murdering his predecessor, Nicholas III dalle Carceri. As his wife's dowry, Pietro received the islands of Andros and Syros. Zeno was a very able diplomat; the historian of Frankish Greece William Miller calls him \\"a diplomatist of unrivalled experience in the tortuous politics of the Levant\\" and \\"the most useful diplomatist of the age\\". As a result, the Venetians employed him in several difficult and delicate negotiations. He played a role in the negotiations that saw the return of Argos to the Republic of Venice after its occupation by the Byzantine Despot of the Morea, Theodore I Palaiologos. In the aftermath of the Battle of Ankara in 1402 he was sent to the Ottoman court to seek Ottoman support against the Florentine adventurer Antonio I Acciaioli, who had recently captured Athens from Venice. Playing on Ottoman fears of a concerted Christian campaign against them in the aftermath of their disastrous defeat at Ankara, he managed to extract a number of concessions from S√ºleyman √áelebi in the Treaty of Gallipoli, concluded in January or early February 1403: Venice was granted a strip of territory on the Greek mainland opposite the whole length of the island of Euboea, which was a Venetian possession; the Northern Sporades were ceded to the Byzantines; the transfer of the County of Salona to the Knights Hospitaller was ratified; the tribute levied on the Marquisate of Bodonitsa was not raised; and finally the Sultan promised to restore Athens to Venice. In the event, the latter promise remained a dead letter, and Venice was forced to recognize Acciaioli rule over Athens a few years later. In 1404, Zeno visited England to seek the aid of Henry IV of England, but without any tangible success. Despite his great diplomatic ability and prestige, which led to him being attributed the title of \\"Duke of Andros\\", even Zeno found it difficult to manoeuvre among the various competing powers of the era. Syros, Paros and other islands were left destitute and almost depopulated by the repeated Ottoman raids. Andros managed to escape relatively unscathed, but in return Zeno was forced to pay tribute and provide harbour and shelter for the Turkish ships there. Nevertheless, in 1416, the island was raided and almost the entire population carried off by the Ottomans. At about the same time Albanians crossed from Euboea over into the island, settling in its northern part. In 1427, Pietro Zeno died, and was succeeded by his son Andrea, who was of poor health and only had a daughter. In 1437, Andrea too died, and the island was taken over by Venice, which installed a governor there until 1440, when its ownership was given to Crusino I Sommaripa.

It is a Grade II* Listed building. English Heritage: Images of England, photograph and architectural description The Eden family who held the manor of Windlestone in the 17th century were Royalists during the English Civil War, and Colonel Robert Eden who had served in the King's army, was obliged to campaign for the return of his confiscated estate. Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, his grandson, also Robert Eden, was created a baronet in 1672, (see Eden baronets).The Baronetage of England Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of all the Baronets now existing, Edward Kimber and Richard Johnson, Vol 2 (1771) pp. 368-70 In 1821, the fifth Baronet, Robert Johnson Eden, replaced the 16th-century manor house with a new mansion designed by architect Ignatius Bonomi. The two-storey house presents a twelve-bay balustraded frontage to the east. A balustraded Doric order colonnade extends across nine bays of the ground floor. The north ends in a large apse. A billiard room was attached to the north east in the late-19th century. On the death of the fifth Baronet in 1844, the estate and Baronetcy passed to his first cousin once removed, Sir William Eden, who was already the fourth Eden of Maryland Baronet. He was High Sheriff of Durham in 1848. The house was the birthplace in 1897 of Anthony Eden, the younger son of the sixth baronet; Eden entered parliament as a Conservative Party Member of Parliament in 1923, later serving as a cabinet minister before serving as Prime Minister from 1955 to 1957. Eden's brother Timothy inherited the baronetcy and the estate on the death of their father in 1915, and sold the Hall (along with 4,500 acres, a London property at Hyde Park Gardens and the village of Rushyford) in 1936 to John Todd of Northallerton.\\"Windlestone Hall sold\\", Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette, 15 July 1936, p. 2. By that time, the Hall had been leased for three years to the Wayfarers' Benevolent Fund, a charity helping to train young homeless people. The lease still had seven years remaining at the time of the sale. The house and estate were used as a prisoner of war camp during World War II, a satellite camp of Harperley POW Camp 93. Durham County Council acquired the Hall around 1954\\"Damage to Eden family mausoleum\\", Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer, 15 November 1954, p. 3. and, between 1957 and 2006, it was occupied by Windlestone Hall School, a local authority residential special school. The school closed in 2006, and was sold for ¬£240,000 by Durham County Council to William Davenport, a private investor, in 2011.\\"Windlestone Hall still derelict despite millions invested\\", BBC News, 14 October 2019. Retrieved 14 October 2019. Durham County Council was criticised for the sale, especially when Windlestone Hall was put back on the market three years later for ¬£2,500,000 ‚Äì over ten times the previous sale price. Davenport, the investor, was jailed for 6 years in 2016 for using forged documents to acquire a mortgage when purchasing the house and estate, and the property was repossessed by the bank. Windlestone Hall was listed for auction with an entry guide price of ¬£400,000 in July 2017. On 17 July 2017 it was removed from the auction and marked as \\"sold prior to auction\\" to an, as yet, unknown buyer.Stuart Arnold, \\"Windlestone Hall, near Rushyford, County Durham, is withdrawn from auction after being sold to mystery buyer\\", The Northern Echo, 19 July 2017. Retrieved 14 October 2019. The BBC later reported that the Hall had been purchased Carlauren, a property developer, for ¬£850,000; it intended to turn the Hall into a high-end care home and attracted ¬£8.5m in investment through the sale of 53 residential units which investors would lease to care-home residents. The BBC reported in October 2019, however, that the property was \\"still derelict\\" and not operating as a care home. Having been exposed to the elements since the major roof metal (lead) theft of 2017, the building is now considered to be beyond economical repair - costing more to repair than its completed value. In November 2019 Durham County Council secured the property and gave notice for no access due to safety. The interior is deteriorating rapidly although it seems work has started by someone, as yet unknown, to secure the exterior from further damage and deterioration. In July 2020 the Hall and Estate were purchased by a dedicated preservation trust, a registered UK charity, with the sole aim of protecting, restoring and preserving the heritage assets. The Trust have ambitious plans for complete restoration of Windlestone Hall to its former glory as a significant private residence, reinstatement of the walled gardens and grounds, returning the designed landscape and reinstating a working and viable country estate with significant access for the public.

The 1951s were actually called \\"Hudson Super Custom Six\\". First generation (1916) The first Hudson Super Six was introduced on 16 January, 1916. Also known as the Series H, the Super Six was an early performance car. Its inline-six developed , compared to the of the equally dimensioned engine fitted to the contemporary Hudson Model Six-40. Before its introduction, Super Sixes made a series of speed runs on a track in Long Island, NY, followed by a new record transcontinental run (San Francisco to New York in 5 days, 3 hours, and 31 minutes - returning after an 8-hour break), a stock chassis speed record at Daytona Beach, a record at Pikes Peak, and the stock chassis 24-hour record at an average speed of . The last record stood until 1931, when a Marmon took it. In John Steinbecks novel The Grapes of Wrath, the Joad family depends on a Hudson Super Six sedan converted into a truck.

The lower-cost Model R sat on a wheelbase, while that of the Model S is . Two standard bodies were available, a two-door Coach and a four-door Sedan. The Model O was also available with five different Custom bodystyles, made by Biddle and Smart of Massachusetts. The engine was updated in July 1927, with a new manifold and a different head design, including the relocation of the spark plugs and intake valves. Hudson chose not to increase the claimed power, but many consider the stated output to be very conservative. In 1927, Essex also chose the Super Six label for their cars, while aligning their design with that of the larger Hudsons.Standard Catalog of Independents, p. 84 Essex kept calling their cars Super Sixes in 1928 and off and on until 1932.Standard Catalog of Independents, p. 86 For 1928, the Model O and Model S continued with some styling changes, including a taller and slimmer radiator, larger, more oval headlights, and vertical louvers on the hood. Also new was a standard-bodied Coupe on the Model S chassis, as well as a Biddle and Smart- bodied roadster on the same short wheelbase. Murphy Body of Pasadena designed the custom bodies used on the Model O, although Hudson chose Biddle and Smart to build these designs. For 1929 the Super Six badge was dropped in favor of the \\"Greater Hudson\\" label, and for 1930 all Hudsons had eight-cylinder engines. The 1929 R and L models' wheelbases were stretched by about four inches, the wheels were changed to 19-inch wire wheels, but they carried over the Super Six engine as well as the Murphy-designed/Biddle and Smart-made bodies.

While the low cost Essex- Terraplane sat on a wheelbase, the Series E Hudson Super-Six has . The engine displaced and produced depending on the compression ratio.Standard Catalog of Independents, p. 56 Fourth generation (1940) For the 1940 model year, Hudson reintroduced the \\"Super Six\\" nameplate again. This time it sat on a six-cylinder version of the new Hudson Eight, sharing that car's wheelbase. This was five inches longer than that of the regular Hudson Six, which was available as either the Traveler or DeLuxe. The regular Six was called Series 40T and 40P respectively, whereas the Super Six was Series 41. The Super Six also received a larger, engine with , ten more than the Hudson Six. This engine was also shared with the large Hudson Country Club Six, with its wheelbase, as well as the Hudson Big Boy series of commercial vehicles. Body styles started with a 3-passenger Coupe or a 5-passenger Victoria Coupe (sharing the same sheetmetal), continuing with a two- or four-door Touring Sedan, and culminating with a two-door Convertible Coupe as well as the two- door Convertible Sedan (seating five people).

Richelieu pearls were popular as an affordable alternative for consumers who were looking for inexpensive yet attractive faux pearls. Manufacturing process Cultured pearls are made by placing round beads made from the shells of American mussels into salt water mollusks along with some mantle tissue from another salt water mollusk. The mollusks cover the bead nucleus with layers of nacre. In contrast, Richelieu fake pearls were made by painting a glass or plastic bead with an iridescent substance (ground fish scales) obtained from a fish which lived in European rivers. Many coatings were necessary before the fake pearl was completed.

Plot Jefferson Scott, Jr. and Robert Gordon, hunters in the Belgian Congo, are thrown together with missionaries Sangamon and Mary Morton and their daughter Ruth. Scott marries Ruth, and Gordon is entrusted with stock certificates to be taken back to Scott's father in America. Later Scott and the elder Mortons are killed by the native Wakandas; Ruth and her daughter Virginia are saved by Belgian forces and afterwards return to America to live with Scott's father. The stock certificates, meanwhile, have gone astray, with only a single sheet of paper having been delivered to the elder Scott. 19 years pass. On the death of Jefferson Scott, Sr., Virginia Scott is to inherit the estate, but the will cannot be located, and Scott Taylor, her grandfather‚Äôs disinherited nephew, appears to claim a half-share. Proposing to Virginia in an effort to obtain it all, he is rebuffed, whereupon he disputes her right to any of the estate, pretending she is illegitimate. Ruth attempts to prove her marriage to Virginia's father by writing to Robert Gordon, who witnessed the ceremony, but he is now deceased. Her appeal reaches his son Dick Gordon instead. Moved but unable to provide the desired proof, Gordon writes back of his intention to sail to Africa to seek documentation of the marriage there. Taylor intercepts the letter and follows him with the intention of murder. Discovering this, Virginia also sets out for Africa. Gordon reaches the ruins of the old mission and finds there a sealed envelope, with which he begins his trek back to the coast. Taylor and his confederates Kelley and Gootch await him in ambush in a native village. They kill a lioness, whose mate the natives take captive in a pit trap. Virginia arrives at the village and is imprisoned by the villains. Meanwhile, Gordon discovers and frees the captured lion, which then returns to the village seeking the killers of its mate. The lion arrives just as the villains are about to rape and kill Virginia, and kills Gootch while others flee. Virginia escapes but is stalked by a hyena. Gordon, who happens to be nearby, hears her scream and shoots the beast. She warns him against Taylor, who then appears with Kelley, seeking her. Seizing Gordon‚Äôs gun, she wounds Taylor and drives the villains off. They return to America and separate, Gordon somehow neglecting to give her the envelope. Meanwhile, the lion has been captured by hunters and sold to an itinerant American circus, in which he is billed as \\"Ben, King of Beasts, the Man-Eating Lion\\". Realizing his omission, Gordon visits the Scott home to deliver the envelope to Virginia and Ruth, unaware that Taylor and Kelley have returned from Africa and still plan to kill him. He finds the Scotts absent from home, their return delayed by a train wreck. Ben, who was also on the train, is freed by the wreck and turns up at the house, where he detects the scents of both his rescuer Gordon and the two villains. Encountering the latter, he kills Kelley and pursues Taylor to Gordon's room. There Taylor struggles with Gordon and overcomes him, taking the envelope before fleeing from Ben. The lion follows, overtaking and killing Taylor within sight of the returning Scotts. Gordon, pursuing Taylor, recognizes Ben and protects him from the armed party that arrives to kill the escaped lion. He buys Ben from the circus, intending to give him a new home in a zoo. The mysterious envelope, finally opened, proves to contain the long- lost stocks, not the hoped-for marriage certificate. The latter turns up, together with the missing will, in a cupboard in the Scott house, having been secreted there by Jefferson Scott, Sr. The certificate was evidently the paper Gordon's father had delivered to the elder Scott instead of the stocks. Dick Gordon and Virginia Scott declare their love for each other and decide to marry.

This problem has been solved as Ramechhap was declared a separate municipality and Manthali a separate one..  Etymology  The name of the place comes from two words of the people of the Majhi (a fisher tribe of Nepal). It is a combination of two words \\"Mun\\" and \\"Thali\\". The former means a local alcoholic dish of Majhi people who are the locals of this place and the later means a place. The word Munthali means a place for eating Mun. It was later named Manthali.

The castle is 20 km southeast of Ljubljana and is considered among the most impressive in the area. Etymology The origin of the castle's name is uncertain: local tradition has held that it derives from the extinct wild cattle aurochs (in Slovene, tur). It is more likely a corruption of the name of its founders, the knights Ursberg, later Auersperg. The similarity to Turriaco in Italy, also known as Turjak in Slovene, is widely considered coincidental. History Turjak Castle, panorama The first Turjak castle was built on the site as early as the late 11th century by the knights (later counts) von Auersperg. It may have been extant by 1062, the date the family (specifically Konrad von Auersperg) is first mentioned. In 1140, it was destroyed and burned during a succession struggle between the two heirs of Pilgram II von Auersperg, his son Pilgram IV and his son-in-law Otto von Ortenburg. The castle was held by Pilgram IV, who was defeated. In 1190 it was rebuilt by count Adolf II von Auersperg, whose son Otto became entangled in a complicated war with the noble houses of von Gortz, Ortenburg, and the Patriarchate of Aquileia, during which the castle was again flattened. Afterward, the site of the first two castles was abandoned in favor of the current one further upslope. Turjak Castle, 1689 engraving in The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola The current castle is first mentioned in 1220. In 1270, Peter and Wolfgang von Auersperg sold it to another branch of the family, only to have it bought back by Balthazar von Auersperg, chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 14th century, Auersperg owners included Gerhard (1317), and the brothers Friederich, Volkard and Herward. The castle was completely destroyed by the great earthquake of 1511, but was rebuilt in time to successfully resist a furious peasants' revolt in 1515 that laid waste to several other castles in the region. It faced a more serious challenge from Turkish raiders, who undertook major assaults against it in 1491 and 1528, but were repelled both times. The Auerspergs had a reputation as capable military leaders; Ivan of Turjak fell in the battle of Vienna in 1529, Herbard of Turjak (Herbard VIII von Auersperg) died at Budaƒçko in 1575, while Andreas von Auersperg, the \\"Carniolan Achilles,\\" commanded Carinthian and Carniolan forces at the battle of Sisak and contributed to a decisive victory against the Ottomans on 22 June 1593. Turjak Castle, 1689 engraving in The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola During the 16th century, the Auerspergs were strong supporters of the Protestant Reformation in Slovenia. The major Slovene Protestant leaders Primo≈æ Trubar and Jurij Dalmatin were offered sanctuary at the castle, and worked on the first translation of the Bible into Slovene during their stay. The Counts also offered financial support to the project of printing some of the first Slovene books. 17th century Turjak lords included Johan Andreas von Auersperg and Wolf Engelbert von Auersperg, the last noted by the historian Valvasor, who attested to the castle's importance by including two etchings of it in his \\"Glory of the Duchy of Carniola\\" of 1689, including a two-page spread. His son and successor Adam Anton Siegfried established a fideicommiss or entailment in 1739 (the year of his death), including the Turjak lordship, the holding of Nadlischegg in Mokronog and the Turjak (or Auersperg) PalaceLjubljana City Museum in Ljubljana. He was succeeded by eldest son Adolf Engelbert Ignaz, who died in 1768. On 20 May 1769, the allodial land ownership passed to his widow Elisabeth (nee Lichtenberg), while the fideicommiss went to his brother-in-law Josef Maria. After his death on 24 December 1805, the fideicommiss properties went to Johann Paul Alois, and then to the count Josef von Auersperg, who held it until his death on 12 October 1883, followed by his son count Leo von Auersperg. Between 1916 and 1931, the owner of the fideicommiss was Leo's son Herward, followed by his son, also named Herward. On 19 September 1943, the castle was taken by Partisans (ironically of the Pre≈°eren brigade) after a lengthy battle with its garrison of Slovene Blue Guard detachments of Yugoslav Army in the Homeland. About five hundred of them were taken prisoner and became the target of retribution, in the form of notable war crimes. The castle was severely damaged in the battle, and lay in ruins for several years. Following WWII, the castle was nationalized, and restoration work slowly undertaken. In 2006, the president of Slovenia, Janez Drnov≈°ek, founded the Movement for Justice and Development, a civil-society group, at a large rally at the castle. Architecture The castle is of triangular layout and stands on a terraced hill. Large Renaissance defensive towers (bastilles) at the points of the triangle are connected by residential wings. The western tower contains a suite of dungeons of varying degrees of unpleasantness. The tall central palacium dates from the Romantic period. The castle has been significantly altered several times throughout its history. As recently as the 1680s, the Valvasor engravings show a rectangular structure with small towers at only two corners and a large bastille at the eastern end. This layout dates to the major rebuilding after the devastating 1512 earthquake, though some pre-16th century elements survive, notably the north wing and portions of the defensive walls. The original 10th- or 11th-century castle stood lower on the slope; some minor ruins are still visible. The castle is unusual in having two chapels. A Catholic one on the west side has served as a church since 1789; after a 1990 renovation, mass has been held there every Sunday. A second Romanesque Protestant chapel is named after Dalmatin, and contains the tombs of the Protestant counts, as well as gothic frescoes. The slab built in the tower, 16th century On the east side of the castle, a stone slab adorns the \\"ox tower.\\" The inscription grasped early days of the castle. The coat-of-arms and the bison are engraved next to the text, that was gilded once upon a time. The inscription announced: > ANNO DOMINI 1067 IAR IST AVRSPERG DVRCH HERN CONRAT VON AVRSPERG ANGEFANGEN > PAVN NACHMALS DVRCH DEN ERT PVDEM IM 1511 IAR ZERSCHVT ABER DVRCH MICH > TROIAN VON AVRSPERG OBRISTN ERB CAMRER IN CRAIN VNMD DER WIDISCHEN MARK IN > GRVND ABGESPROCEHN VND VON NEVEN ANGEFANGEN ZV PAVEN IM 1520 IAR Cultural significance Linden tree at the castle gates, an example of poetic licence Turjak Castle is fairly well known in Slovenia, in part for its colorful and turbulent history, which includes several grotesque vignettes: *Once displayed in the castle armory were the heads of Herbard von Auersperg and Friedrich von Weichselburg (Slovene: Herbard Turja≈°ki and Friderik of Vi≈°nja Gora), both killed in battle with Ottoman forces in 1575. Their heads were skinned and tanned, then sent as mementos to the Sultan in Constantinople, from where relatives later ransomed them at considerable cost. *The chapel of the Turjak graveyard houses a glass jar containing the preserved heart of the young count Hanno von Auersperg (1838-1861), who supposedly committed suicide after being exiled to Naples by his family for refusing to give up a girl who was beneath him socially. The castle is also known for its importance to the history of the Reformation in Slovene lands; its greatest claim to fame, however, is as the setting of one of Slovene national poet France Pre≈°eren's most popular ballads, \\"Rosamund of Turjak\\" (Turja≈°ka Rozamunda). It concerns the wooing of the bratty heiress of Turjak in the late Middle Ages.

It was built in 1879 by Vaithi Padayatchi, a Tamil Hindu immigrant. Location Mariamman Temple is the main Tamil Hindu temple in Thailand and is located in the Bangrak district of Bangkok at the corner of Silom Road (‡∏ñ‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏•‡∏°) and Pan Road, a narrower road where a number of kiosks sell saffron- coloured marigold flower garlands for worshippers. History Following India becoming a colony of the British Empire in 1858 many from the southern state of Tamil Nadu preferred to leave their country than live under colonial rule. One such group of Indians came to Bangkok, many as traders of gemstones or cattle ranchers. A leader of this group of Indians was Vaithi Padayatchi who built this temple about a decade after they arrived; and a street in Silom is named after him - Soi Vaiti - known, in English, as Vithy Lane. Sri Maha Mariamman is the oldest and most important such temple in Thailand. Features The temple's facade is in strikingly florid style of a riot of different colours with carved images of various gods and goddesses in different shapes and sizes. At the entrance to the temple there is a gopura or tower 6 metres in height and covered with many carved images of deities.

It is said that 85% of the Thais visit the temple, many believing that Hinduism is not a separate religion but a branch of Buddhism. Religious festivals, such as Navratri, take place here following the traditional Tamil calendar in September/October. This festival, which is believed to give redress from bad luck, is held for ten days and on the final day the street in front of the temple is colourfully decorated with yellow flower garlands and candles, and the image of Sri Maha Mariamman is taken through the streets in a procession; during this time a portion of the Silom is blocked to traffic. Deepavali is also a special festival in the temple when it is brightly lit up. An oil lamp ritual is held on most middays' and on Fridays, and prasad, food blessed by god, is distributed to devotees. Apart from these two major festivals, daily worships are attended by a large number of Thai Buddhists and Chinese who believe that Hindu gods help them in business and bless their women to conceive.

The film was notable for integrating a number of technical innovations into its narrative of a \\"cinematic melodrama\\". It achieved considerable success on its release, as a ground-breaking film that was distinctively French at a time when the cinema was felt to be dominated by American productions. Background In his previous five films Marcel L'Herbier had explored a variety of photographic and narrative techniques in the fast-developing medium of film, and in 1921 he wanted to draw them together in the context of a story which would have a broad appeal for the public.Richard Abel, French cinema: the first wave 1915-1929. (Princeton U.P, 1984) p.306 He was also eager to film in the landscapes of Spain which had long been an inspiration for him, especially as filtered through the writings of Maurice Barr√®s. He submitted an original scenario for a melodrama called El Dorado, set in Andalusia, to his producer L√©on Gaumont, and rather to his surprise it was immediately accepted. L'Herbier was adamant that the film should carry the subtitle \\"m√©lodrame\\", both to indicate the popular origins of its story, but also to point to its more traditional sense of the combination of drama and music. He was less candid about his intentions for incorporating imaginative and unconventional visual effects into his familiar subject-matter.Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. (Paris: Belfond, 1979). p.56. An initial budget of 92,000 francs was allocated, but in the end the film cost nearly 400,000 francs.Dimitri Vezyroglou, \\"De Gaumont √† Cin√©graphic (1919-1929): le trajectoire asymptotique de Marcel L'Herbier, auteur-producteur\\", in: Marcel L'Herbier: l'art du cin√©ma; ed. Laurent V√©ray. (Paris: Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma, 2007). p.68. Synopsis In Granada in Spain, Sibilla works as a dancer in a squalid cabaret called El Dorado, struggling to earn enough to care for her sick child. The boy's father Estiria, a prominent citizen, refuses them both help and recognition, fearful of jeopardising the engagement of his adult daughter Iliana to a wealthy nobleman. Iliana however slips away from her engagement party to meet her real lover Hedwick, a Swedish painter. Sibilla, in desperation after a further rejection by Estiria, sees an opportunity to blackmail him by locking the lovers overnight in their meeting- place in the Alhambra. Sibilla confesses her action to Hedwick, who hides Iliana in El Dorado while he appeals to her father. Faced with Estiria's unremitting rage, Hedwick and Iliana decide to take refuge at his mother's remote house on the Sierra Nevada, and they propose to Sibilla that they take her son (revealed to Iliana as her half-brother) with them so that he can be properly cared for in a healthy climate. Sibilla reluctantly agrees, but she is distraught as she returns to her empty room at El Dorado where she even has to fight off Joao, the cabaret's clown, as he tries to rape her. Knowing that she will not see her son again, she performs a last dance on stage to rapturous applause before going backstage to stab herself. Cast √àve Francis as Sibilla Jaque Catelain as the young painter Hedwick Marcelle Pradot as Hedwick's lover Iliana Philippe H√©riat as the lecherous clown Joao Georges Paulais as Estiria, the father of Sibilla's son Claire Pr√©lia as the Swedish mother of Hedwick Production A substantial part of the film was to be shot on location in Granada, Seville and the Sierra Nevada, and filming began in March 1921. For the first time ever, permission had been granted for a film company to shoot inside the Alhambra palace and L'Herbier gave prominent place to its gardens, fountains and geometric architectural patterns. These became some of the film's most memorable images. During the approach to Easter, he also seized the chance to film the spectacular Holy Week processions which took place in Seville and to incorporate this documentary footage within the fiction of his story.Jaque Catelain, Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950). p.51. The interiors were subsequently filmed at the Gaumont studios in Paris at Buttes-Chaumont. With his principal cameraman Georges Lucas, L'Herbier created a number of optical effects during filming. When Sibilla is first introduced among the other dancers on stage, a partial blurring of the image places her out-of-focus while those around her are sharply defined, an effect repeated in her subsequent dance to suggest that she herself is not fully focussed on her surroundings because her mind is preoccupied with the plight of her son. Distortion of close-up images of customers in the cabaret reflect their intoxication and lust. A similar technique is used later to introduce a note of visual horror into the scene when Joao tries to rape Sibilla. A different use of optical distortion in the scenes of Hedwick at work in the Alhambra shows how the actual settings of his paintings are transformed in the painter's imagination.Richard Abel, French cinema: the first wave 1915-1929. (Princeton U.P, 1984) p.308-312. L'Herbier was at pains to draw a distinction between his approach and that used in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919) in which visual distortions are incorporated into the design of the sets - which were then photographed normally. In El Dorado it is the camera itself which is used to shape the images seen by the viewer.Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. (Paris: Belfond, 1979). p.65. These uses of semi-subjective camerawork have been one of the most discussed aspects of the film in subsequent criticism. L'Herbier was an ardent advocate of colour tinting of the finished photographic image, and he devised an elaborate scheme of colouring to enhance the effect of different scenes and shots, and sometimes to clarify the shift between the present and a past flashback. (A surviving print held by the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise preserves these tinted effects.)Richard Abel, French cinema: the first wave 1915-1929. (Princeton U.P, 1984) p.579 note 11. L'Herbier regarded the musical accompaniment of a film as being supremely important, and in El Dorado he sought to produce a closer integration between image and music than had been achieved before. He commissioned the young composer Marius-Fran√ßois Gaillard (who was only 21) to compose an orchestral score which was based upon the final cut of the film. This allowed the music to be precisely synchronised with the action of the film instead of the rather approximate playing of 'mood music' which was then common practice. L'Herbier claimed that this was the first time that an exactly synchronised orchestral score had been written for a film, and although full scores for films had been previously produced in Europe and USA, this was at least a pioneering example of music written as an exact counterpoint to the image.Theodore van Houten. \\"Gaillard, Marius-Fran√ßois\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians; 2nd ed. (London: Macmillan, 2001) vol.9, p.424. L'Herbier enjoyed complete artistic freedom during filming but his relations with his producer L√©on Gaumont deteriorated as the schedule and the budget both exceeded expectations. Gaumont was not impressed by the 'artistic' visual devices of blurred and distorted images. When the film was first shown to him, he angrily interrupted the screening to demand that the projectionist should correct his equipment, and he was scarcely mollified when it was explained that these were a deliberate part of the director's vision.Jaque Catelain, Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950). p.52-53. Reception When the film was first shown to the press in July 1921, it met with widespread critical acclaim. The newspaper Bonsoir unprecedentedly devoted a whole page to its review in which three different critics were unanimous in their recognition of the film's historic importance.Jaque Catelain, Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950). p.54-56. Another critic appreciated that the use of a melodramatic subject did not prevent the film from achieving \\"a magnificent poetry\\".Jean-Louis Croze, [review] in Comoedia, 1 November 1921, quoted in the booklet accompanying the Gaumont DVD of El Dorado (2002). There was particular praise for the performance of √âve Francis who achieves an intense tragic grandeur in the final scenes.E.g. Marcel Achard and L√©on Moussinac, quoted in Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. (Paris: Belfond, 1979). p.64. The critic and film-maker Louis Delluc gave the film perhaps its most succinct judgment: \\"√áa, c'est du cin√©ma!\\" (\\"That's cinema!\\")Louis Delluc, in Paris-Midi, 9 juillet 1921, quoted in the booklet accompanying the Gaumont DVD of El Dorado (2002). There were a few dissenting voices including the poet and critic Ricciotto Canudo, who felt that the film's pictorial effects were insufficiently grounded in the subject.Ricciotto Canudo, in Aux √âcoutes, 7 ao√ªt 1921, quoted in Marcel L'Herbier, La T√™te qui tourne. (Paris: Belfond, 1979). p.65. When the film was released to the public in October 1921 it enjoyed a broad success, even though some spectators were sufficiently impatient with the visual effects to make occasionally vocal protests.Jaque Catelain, Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. (Paris: Vautrain, 1950). p.56. The considerable reputation which the film won in the 1920s was largely confined to France at that time since it does not appear to have been distributed abroad.Richard Abel, French cinema: the first wave 1915-1929. (Princeton U.P, 1984) p.579 note 9. Among those who subsequently felt the influence of El Dorado was Alain Resnais who \\"sought to renew a certain style of silent cinema\\" when he was making L'Ann√©e derni√®re √† Marienbad.Roy Armes, The Cinema of Alain Resnais. (London: Zwemmer; New York: A.S Barnes, 1968) p.55. Restoration A restoration of El Dorado was carried out for Gaumont in 1995 by the Service des Archives du Film du CNC, in collaboration with the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise, and the Swiss Film Archive. A DVD based on this restoration, accompanied by archival material, was released by Gaumont in 2002. Further reading *Abel, Richard. French cinema: the first wave 1915-1929.

Example  A feeling of nuclear optimism emerged in the 1950s in which it was believed that all power generators in the future would be atomic in nature. The atomic bomb would render all conventional explosives obsolete and nuclear power plants would do the same for power sources such as coal and oil. There was a general feeling that everything would use a nuclear power source of some sort, in a positive and productive way, from irradiating food to preserve it, to the development of nuclear medicine. There would be an age of peace and plenty in which atomic energy would \\"provide the power needed to desalinate water for the thirsty, irrigate the deserts for the hungry, and fuel interstellar travel deep into outer space\\".Benjamin K.

It is still in its infancy, being admitted into the Asian Rugby Football Union in 2004, and more recently, into the International Rugby Board in 2005. It was set up in 1977, and registered officially as a society in November 2004, and has been formally admitted as an associate member of the Asian Rugby Football Union. It was granted full membership in the game's controlling body, the International Rugby Board in late 2005.

According to the archives of the Royal Brunei Yacht Club, a \\"Town Rugby Football Team\\" played a team from the Seria district in 1957. In the mid 1970s, rugby in Brunei grew in popularity with the influx of expatriates from Britain and active participation from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces (RBAF), Brunei Shell Recreation Club, Royal Brunei Yacht Club, the Panaga Club and the British Garrison in Seria. A domestic competition took place from 1978 to 1993, involving regular teams from the Panaga Club, the Royal Brunei Yacht Club, the British Garrison, the Royal Brunei Armed Forces, the Royal Brunei Police, the Brunei Shell recreation Club, Pirates RFC and the Miri RFC from Malaysia. Numerous clubs also organised Rugby sevens and tens competitions from time to time, but the large number of British and Commonwealth expatriates leaving the sultanate in the late 1990s led to a decline in the number of such tournaments.

A narrow gauge railroad connecting the mine to the nearby town of Delta, California operated for several decades. History of the mine The company owned and operated the Delta gold mine, in the Dog Creek mining district, about seven miles west of Delta, on Upper Dog Creek. A stamp mill was erected on Dog Creek, near the mine. The orebodies were narrow quartz veins in greenstone, containing free gold and sulfide minerals.William B. Clark, 1963, Gold Districts of California, California Division of Mines and geology, Bulletin 193, p.136 History of the narrow gauge railroad In 1902 a gauge railroad was constructed from the Southern Pacific transfer at Delta Station to the stamp mill some 6.5 miles away. In the middle 1880s, Delta had been the terminus of the California and Oregon Railroad, later absorbed by the Central Pacific. A switchback was used to ascend to the flat table land above Delta, and from there the line pursued a gradual grade west on the north side of Dog Creek, maintaining elevation until the creek rose to meet it about 2 miles from the mill site. From here on, the grade was right at creekside. For many years a Climax, called \\"The Doctor\\", was used for power and the only other equipment seems to have been a single flatcar upon which sacked ore was shipped to Delta for transfer to Southern Pacific. They were then taken to the smelters at Kennet and Coram for further processing. Today both of these towns are under Shasta Lake. Operations on the line were infrequent, and ceased altogether in the early 1920s. The property fell into the hands of Cash Elder, who had been a mining engineer, and arrangements were made to dispose of the railroad. The locomotive apparently went to South America along with some rail in about 1928. The rest of the railroad remained largely intact until 1941 when it was pulled up for scrap. Today nearly the entire right of way can be traced winding alongside and just below the present Dog Creek Road.

The 322d Wing used rotational Lockheed C-130 Hercules squadrons for tactical airlift in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. In addition, the wing used C-118s and C-131s for aeromedical airlift until late 1972, then shifted to C-9As for this work, continuing aeromedical airlift operations through March 1975. The wing utilized KC-135 (VIP equipped) to provide transportation for CINCUSAFE until early 1973, followed by KC-135B until early 1974 and by C-135C thereafter. Used VT-29 aircraft to support Air Force North, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization component. In March 1973, the wing gained the 7th Special Operations Squadron, equipped with C-47, UH-1H, and C-130E aircraft, which was reassigned from the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Ramstein Air Base when the 26th moved to Zweibr√ºcken AB. All but the C-130s were transferred a few months later, to conduct unconventional warfare operations in Europe. The wing was inactivated in June 1975 when it was replaced by the 435th Tactical Airlift Wing.

Its range extends in the United States from Maine to North Carolina, with reports of a few populations north of the international frontier in Ontario. The name ilicifolia means \\"holly-leaved.\\" Quercus ilicifolia is a deciduous tree or shrub growing occasionally reaching a height of 6 meters (20 feet) but usually much smaller. It is \\"gangly\\" and can form a dense thicket. The plant grows from a large taproot which can be up to 20 centimeters (8 inches) thick. The taproot lives a long time, producing several generations of above-ground parts. The alternately arranged leaves are each up to 15 centimeters (6 inches) long by 10 cm (4 inches) wide. The species is monoecious, with plants bearing both male catkins and solitary or clustered female flowers. The egg- shaped acorn is 1 to 2 centimeters (0.4-0.8 inch) long with a saucer-shaped cap. The plant reproduces sexually by seed and also vegetatively by sprouting new stems. Quercus ilicifolia is a dominant plant species in a number of regions and habitat types. In Maine it can be found in deciduous forests alongside red maple (Acer rubrum), gray birch (Betula populifolia), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). In Massachusetts it codominates with black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata) on the shrublands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. On Cape Cod it occurs with pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and broom crowberry (Corema conradii). It can be found on the Pine Barrens of New Jersey and pine barrens habitat on Long Island. It also occurs in fire barrens on granite and gneiss further north in Canada.Catling, Paul M and Vivian R. Brownell. 1999. The flora and ecology of southern Ontario granite barrens. Pages 392-405 in Anderson, R.C., J.S. Fralish, and J.M. Baskin (eds). Savannas, Barrens, and Rock Outcrop Plant Communities of North America. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. This oak is adapted to disturbance in the habitat, such as wildfire. Hence, it does not tolerate shade and it requires disturbance to clear remove other plant species so it can receive sunlight. It sprouts prolifically after fire burns away its above-ground parts. Quercus ilicifolia provides food and shelter for many animal species. Bears consume the bitter acorns, especially when preparing for hibernation. White-tailed deer eat the acorns and the stems and foliage. Many types of squirrels cache the acorns. Many birds depend on them; wild turkeys prefer them over other types of food. A large number of insect species live on the oak. This oak species is the main food plant for 29% of the rare or endangered Lepidopterans in southern New England and southeastern New York. Quercus ilicifolia has been used in revegetation projects on the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island. Quercus ilicifolia is also known to rocky summits in the Piedmont of North Carolina where it is listed as a State Endangered Plant.

The plant is operated by Energoatom. Two VVER-1000 reactors are operational, each generating 1000 MW (net) of electricity. Construction of the first reactor started in 1981 and the first unit was put in operation in late 1987. Construction of the second reactor started in 1983 with plans to finish it in 1991. In 1990, however, construction was stopped as part of a moratorium on new plant construction. Construction was completed only in August 2004 after the moratorium was lifted. Two more VVER-1000 reactors are currently under construction. Construction of the third reactor started in September 1985 and the fourth reactor in June 1986. Construction was stopped in 1990 when they were 75% and 28% complete, respectively. An intergovernmental agreement on the resumption of construction was signed between Ukraine and Russia in June 2010. On 10 February 2011, Energoatom and Atomstroyexport signed a contract agreement for the completion of reactors 3 and 4. They should be commissioned in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Feasibility study of reactors 3 and 4 was conducted by Kiev Institute Energoproekt. In September 2015 Ukrainian government decided to terminate the agreement with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnitsky NPP power units. This was confirmed on 12 May 2016. In August 2016 an agreement with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power was made to assist with the completion of reactors 3 and 4, but little progress was made. As of 2020 a Ukrainian working group was assessing the safety of the old cranes on the site needed to progress construction work. Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant is the start of the deactivated Rzesz√≥w‚ÄìKhmelnytskyi powerline, one of three 750 kV lines running from Ukraine to the European Union.

History  It was opened on 6 January 2003 following the merger of Springfield Comprehensive and Hedworthfield Comprehensive, and is based at the old Springfield site. Its full title is Jarrow School, Engineering Excellence In Education, the result of a competition to choose an inspirational name for the new school. In 2007 the school became a specialist Engineering College. http://www.jarrowschool.com/ The former Jarrow Grammar School opened in 1911. In June 2010, this building was demolished.Jarrow School In October 2013 the school's headteacher Sir Kenneth Gibson became the first person to be knighted by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.https://www.theguardian.com/uk- news/2013/oct/17/prince-william-debut-queen-knighthoods = Springfield = Springfield was Jarrow's grammar school and was formerly known as Jarrow Grammar School.It became a comprehensive school in 1975 to cater for all prospective pupils' academic abilities, in common with the other schools in the area including Hedworthfield. = Hedworthfield = Hedworthfield Comprehensive School circa 2002. Hedworthfield was designated as a complementary secondary modern school to Springfield's provision as the local grammar school. It was a newer development built in the 1960s at Fellgate on the outskirts of Jarrow. Extensive building work was completed in the late 1970s providing the school with better facilities for arts and crafts, a music and drama studio, a community centre and a sports complex containing badminton and squash courts, a gym and other facilities. Alongside Springfield, it was converted to a comprehensive school in 1978. However, following its redesignation, some parents still insisted on sending their children to Springfield, even though they were no longer in its catchment area; they cited concerns that an ex-secondary modern school might not measure up to the same academic standards as the former grammar school. Additionally, Hedworthfield had no provision for teaching 6th form pupils, meaning that those choosing to study subjects at A-level had to relocate once they had completed their O-levels or GCSEs. Generally, 6th form students opted to transfer to Springfield to continue their education. = Merger = Following the dwindling number of pupils for the new intake year-on-year, it became apparent that continuing to fund the running of both schools in parallel was no longer viable, so a merger into a single school was proposed. After some debate as to whether it should be on one of the existing sites, or an entirely new site funded by a Private Finance Initiative, the decision was taken to locate the merged school at the Springfield campus. Hedworthfield's OFSTED results were surpassing those of the historically more academic Springfield for some time prior to the merger. Students at both schools protested, and more than 100 pupils at Jarrow School were involved in a \\"near riot\\" during the summer of 2003, during which police made three arrests. =New building= The old Jarrow School building has been replaced by a new school on the same site, funded by Building Schools for the Future. The old school was a built during the reign of Queen Victoria (Victorian Era) and by the millennium was in serious need of either refurbishment or a re-build. It was then decided that the old school was to be demolished and replaced with a modern new school which was funded by Building Schools for the Future scheme and designed by Inspired Spaces. The new building has an outstanding learning environment with light, airy rooms and thriving with high class facilities. Academic performance GCSE results were below the national average. The school was not known to concentrate on the more crucial subjects like Maths and English. Results for these subjects were poor, around 40%. However, this year's (2012) results show a significant increase in achievement with 97% of mainstream students gained 5A*-Cs and 57% of students who accessed the mainstream curriculum gained 5A*-Cs including English and maths, a significant increase of over 7% on last year‚Äôs figure.

This year is characterized by the nation's disgruntled attitude towards the president and his political party. During this time, there is a midterm election and the party in power usually loses a significant number of seats in Congress. Thomas Jefferson is the only two-term President in American history whose party gained seats in both houses in the sixth year of his presidency. Prior to Reconstruction, the six-year itch saw the President's party gain seats in one house, while losing seats in the other house. Presidents before Reconstruction whose party had this occur: * 1814 ‚Äì Democratic-Republican James Madison: Gained 5 seats in the House, but lost 2 seats in the Senate. * 1822 ‚Äì Democratic-Republican James Monroe: Gained 34 seats in the House, while the Senate was unchanged. * 1834 ‚Äì Democrat Andrew Jackson: Lost 0 seats in the House (the smallest swing in the House's history), but gained 1 seat in the Senate and gained control of the chamber. Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson was the only two-term President before Reconstruction not to have this occur. In 1806, his party gained 2 seats in the House and gained 1 seat in the Senate. Also, the Republican Party saw strong gains in the midterms of 1866, although Andrew Johnson, a former Democrat who had been elected as Abraham Lincoln's vice president on the National Union ticket, was president at the time. The Republicans gained 40 seats in the House and 18 seats in the Senate (the largest swing in the history of the Senate). After Reconstruction, the six-year itch saw the President's party consistently lose seats in both houses. Presidents since Reconstruction whose party had this occur: * 1874 ‚Äì Republican Ulysses S. Grant: Lost 93 seats in the House*, lost 10 seats in the Senate. * 1894 ‚Äì Democrat Grover Cleveland (although this was his second term, it was not consecutive with his first): Lost 127 seats in the House* (the largest swing in the House's history), lost 4 seats in the Senate*. * 1918 ‚Äì Democrat Woodrow Wilson: Lost 22 seats in the House*, lost 5 seats in the Senate*. * 1938 ‚Äì Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt: Lost 72 seats in the House, lost 7 seats in the Senate. * 1950 ‚Äì Democrat Harry S. Truman: Lost 28 seats in the House, lost 5 seats in the Senate. * 1958 ‚Äì Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower: Lost 48 seats in the House^, lost 13 seats in the Senate^. * 1974 ‚Äì Republican Richard Nixon (although Gerald Ford was president when the elections took place that year): Lost 48 seats in the House^, lost 4 seats in the Senate^. * 1986 ‚Äì Republican Ronald Reagan: Lost 5 seats in the House^, lost 8 seats in the Senate*. * 2006 ‚Äì Republican George W. Bush: Lost 30 seats in the House*, lost 6 seats in the Senate*. * 2014 ‚Äì Democrat Barack Obama: Lost 13 seats in the House^, lost 9 seats in the Senate*. *: The losses by the President's party resulted in the other party gaining control of this chamber. ^: Although the President's party lost seats, this chamber was already under the control of the opposition party. Bill Clinton is the only two-term President since Reconstruction whose party did not lose seats due to the six- year itch. Democrat Bill Clinton is the only two-term President since Reconstruction not to have this occur. In 1998, his party gained 5 seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate was unchanged (the smallest swing in the Senate's history). His party was uniquely in the minority in both houses of Congress and remained so after the elections. On only three occasions has the six-year itch caused the President's party to lose control of Congress completely: Grover Cleveland in 1894, Woodrow Wilson in 1918, and George W. Bush in 2006. Conversely, only two presidents saw their parties maintain control of Congress even after the six-year itch: Democrats Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938 and Harry S. Truman in 1950. Only two presidents already had a Congress that was completely dominated by the opposition party by the time of the six-year itch: Republicans Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1958 and Richard Nixon (Gerald Ford at the time of the elections) in 1974. In addition, only one president has ever lost control of one house while keeping the other: Republican Ulysses S. Grant in 1874, who lost the House but kept the Senate. Lastly, only two presidents have lost one house of Congress due to the six- year itch after already losing the other one: Republican Ronald Reagan in 1986 and Democrat Barack Obama in 2014 (in both cases, their respective parties lost the Senate while the House was already under the control of the opposition party). Overall, the six-year itch phenomena may be viewed as an extension of the effect where a president's party always loses seats in midterm elections, only to a greater extent than in first-term midterms or single-term midterms. Since Reconstruction, only three presidents have ever seen their party gain seats in a midterm election: Democrats Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934 and Bill Clinton in 1998, and Republican George W. Bush in 2002. See also *Wave election References *\\" The Curse of the Six-Year Itch\\"; The Atlantic Monthly, March, 1986, issue. Volume 257, Number 3 (pages 22‚Äì28).

Produced by Chuck Jones Enterprises, the special was first broadcast November 30, 1978 on CBS. The special was followed in 1979 by Raggedy Ann and Andy in The Pumpkin Who Couldn't Smile. Synopsis Inventor and \\"in\\"-efficiency expert Alexander Graham Wolf, who looks and sounds like Wile E. Coyote, is planning to take over Santa's workshop. Overhearing this, Comet, one of Santa's reindeer, asks Raggedy Ann, Raggedy Andy, and their dog Raggedy Arthur to help her because they're easy to carry and aren't bothered by cold weather. At the factory, Alexander is using a machine to encase all the toys in blocks of a transparent and unbreakable substance called gloopstik (made by the Gloopstik Corporation), to ensure that they'll last forever, even though the children won't be able to play with them. He then intends to charge the children for the gloopstik-encased toys and become rich. After arriving the Raggedies soon meet Alexander and he tries to interest them with his machine. At first Andy is intrigued by the idea, but Ann thinks that it's awful. However, when Alexander uses his machine to encase Arthur both Raggedies become angry. Andy demands that Alexander change their dog right back. Within minutes Alexander tries to do so to Andy and has the claw grab him and toss him in the machine while Ann furiously protests and orders Alexander to put Andy down. However, when he tries to do so to Ann, Andy (who is unharmed) climbs out of the top of the machine and when he sees Alexander chasing Ann, he gets really angry and takes control of the machine. He then encases Alexander in a Christmas tree-shaped block. Ann and Andy laugh until Alexander tells them that gloopstik is unbreakable. At which point they become really worried, and run, hug and tell Arthur that they still love him even though he's stuck. Then the block disintegrates and the Raggedys realize that love is the one thing that can destroy the gloopstik. Breaking the fourth wall, they ask all the children at home to shout \\"LOVE,\\" which causes all the gloopstik blocks to fall apart, including the one in which Alexander's trapped. Having learned his lesson, Alexander destroys his machine (by pushing a button that causes it to consume itself) and leaves the workshop, just before Santa wakes up.

Munroe's roommate Biff Roberts (Jerry Van Dyke) and plain-jane Amanda North (Zeme North) try to seduce each other, while hampered by having to babysit an inquisitive young boy (the son of hotelier Naomi Yates, who has just met and is romancing the group's chaperone, coach Fred Campbell).

Production notes =Development= Jack Warner was impressed by the success of Where the Boys Are (1960). He wanted to make a similar film about the influx of teenagers into Palm Springs during the Easter vacation break, using the large number of young actors they had under contract. The studio had the title, Palm Springs Weekend even before they had a script. In June 1962, Warner gave the job of producing to Michael A. Hoey, who had never produced before, but had impressed Warner through his work as an editor at the studio over four years, most recently The Chapman Report. The studio signed Hoey to a contract as producer and Palm Springs Weekend was going to be his first movie. Earl Hamner Jnr, whose novel Spencer's Mountain had just been bought by Warners, was hired to write the screenplay. Hamner: > They gave the screenplay duties [on Spencer's Mountain] to someone else, and > I think Mr. Warner thought that he owed me one. He called me one day and > asked me what I thought of Palm Springs. I was just newly arrived from New > York, and I told him that I'd never been there. He said, 'I want you to go > there over Easter Weekend and poke around and see if you come back with a > movie.' ... I suppose since he'd just done Spencer's Mountain, he trusted > that I could write about young people. When Norman Taurog signed to direct, he felt the script needed some work, so the studio hired David Schwartz, who had just adapted Sex and the Single Girl. They did not like his work so another writer was hired, Danny Arnold, to do a weekly polish. There was some criticism of the script from Palm Springs councillors. =Casting= The lead actors were all under contract to Warner Bros, apart from Stefanie Powers and Jerry Van Dyke. Tuesday Weld was originally considered for the role of Gail, before Connie Stevens was cast. Troy Donahue was always considered for the part of Jim Munroe. Donahue says he refused to play the role ‚Äì \\"nobody thought this was the kind of movie that would be particularly advantageous to our careers\\" ‚Äì but the studio put him on suspension. He ran out of money and agreed to make the film. Ty Hardin's character was written especially for him as Hoey was impressed by his work in The Chapman Report. Steve Trilling of Warners wanted the part of Eric to be played by Edd Byrnes but Hoey went with Robert Conrad instead. \\"Palm Springs Weekend was an incredible break for me\\", said Conrad later. \\"I saw an opportunity to do some real acting.\\" Some reports say that Donahue's wife Suzanne Pleshette was considered to play Bunny, but Hoey says this was never the case as she was too mature; Stefanie Powers was borrowed from Columbia for the part. =Shooting= Filming went from 10 February to 16 May 1963. It was filmed on location in Palm Springs, as well as in the studio at Warners.The New York Times reviewGianoulis, Tina (2000). \\"Spring Break.\\" St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture. Gale. Retrieved January 7, 2013 from HighBeam Research Troy Donahue later recalled: > The best thing about the film was that it was being made in Palm Springs. > And I was there to drink and get laid. I remember that a friend of mine and > I started at opposite ends of town. Halfway through the movie, we crossed > paths. I got everything he got going in his direction, and he got everything > I got coming in mine. I mean, the picture was tame compared to the reality. Connie Stevens later said \\"By far, that film was one of the most fun times of my life.\\" The two resorts seen in the film are the Irwin Schuman-designed Riviera Hotel (now the Riviera Palm Springs) on North Indian Canyon Drive; and the Desert Palms Inn ‚Äì seen onscreen as \\"Las Casa Yates\\" ‚Äì on Jones Road in Cathedral City. The two hotels served as location for much of the film, both the actual locations and their soundstage replicas.Whispering Palms ‚Äì Palm Springs Weekend: Palm Springs wanted nothing to do with \\"letting loose\\", thank you.

When Fortune's car is wrecked, however, he is pulled from a red 1954 Mercury Monterey.The Internet Movie Car Database Entry for Palm Springs Weekend Cora Dixon's dialogue regarding Easter vacation (\\"I don't know how your father is going to stand all those teenagers ‚Äì and the income tax deadline ‚Äì all in the same week\\") appears to indicate that the film's setting is specifically April 1963, when Easter Sunday fell on April 14, the day before Tax Day. =Music= Frank Perkins composed the score for the film. Larry Kusik and Paul Evans wrote one song that appears in the finished film, \\"Live Young.\\" It is sung over the opening credits by Troy Donahue, an instrumental version is heard during the party scene at Ruth Stewart's house. The Modern Folk Quartet appear as themselves in the sequence at Jack's Casino and are shown singing two songs, \\"The Ox Driver's Song\\" and one unidentified song. Ty Hardin sings an a cappella version of the traditional \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\", and sings with Jerry Van Dyke on Ray Henderson and Mort Dixon's standard, \\"Bye Bye Blackbird.\\" Musical excerpts from the film soundtrack were released as a long-playing vinyl recording in 1964.Palm Springs Weekend: Music from the soundtrack.

It was not a major success at the box office but made a profit for the studio. The movie had a long life on television and video. Earl Hamner later recalled, \\"When the phone rings around midnight, I know it's someone calling to tell me, 'Earl, Palm Springs Weekend is on'.\\" Robert Conrad says his performance impressed Warners enough for them to keep him under contract for a number of years. Troy Donahue later complained that the film was \\"really bad ... a beach movie set in the desert\\". A book of the same title by Marvin H.

The author was renowned crime and western novelist Marvin H. Albert, who also made something of a cottage industry out of movie tie-ins. He seems to have been the most prolific screenplay novelizer of the late '50s through mid '60s, and, during that time, the preeminent specialist at light comedy.

Horseshoe arches can take rounded, pointed or lobed form. They are known from pre-Islamic Syria, where the form was used in the fourth century CE in the Baptistery of Mar Ya'qub (St. Jacob) at NisibinAndrew Petersen: \\"Dictionary of Islamic Architecture\\", Routledge, 1999, , p. 24 and Qasr Ibn Wardan (564 CE). Some argue that it was used earlier in the Sassanian Taq-Kasra in Iraq. It was adopted immediately by the Islamic caliphates, with a form of it appearing in the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in Cairo, the Great Mosque of Damascus (706-715 CE), Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi (727 CE), it appears in friezes in the ruins of Qasr al-Qastal and it is extremely prominent throughout the Umayyad palace at Amman Citadel in Jordan. Horseshoe and semicircular arches are the predominant type of arch used in the Umayyad desert castles in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. However, it was in Spain and North Africa that horseshoe arches developed their characteristic form. Prior to the Muslim invasion of Spain, the Visigoths used them sporadically, although it is a matter of debate whether the arches in the extant churches are pre-Moorish or rebuilt after the Islamic conquest of Iberia. Some tombstones from that period have been found in the north of Spain with horseshoe arches in them, with speculation about a pre-Roman local Celtic tradition. Also, the arch of the Church of Santa Eulalia de Boveda ‚Äì part of a previous Roman temple‚Äîin Lugo, points in that direction. The Umayyads used it prominently and used to enclose it in an alfiz to accentuate the effect of its shape. This can be seen at a large scale in their major work, the Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba. This style of horseshoe arch then spread all over the Caliphate and adjacent areas, and was adopted by the successor Muslim emirates of the peninsula, the taifas, as well as by the Almoravid dynasty, Almohad Caliphate, and the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, although also lobed, round, pointed and multifoil arches were also used at that time. The Mozarabs also adopted this style of arch into their architecture and illuminated manuscripts. Horseshoe arches were also used in the Great Mosque of Kairouan (the earliest surviving part being the mihrab of 862‚Äì863), the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo (completed 879), and in a slightly pointed form, in the Mosque of Muhammad ibn Khairun, Tunisia. Mud√©jar style, developed from the 12th to the 17th centuries, continued the tradition of horseshoe arches in the Iberian Peninsula, which had been started in the 7th century by the Visigoths. In addition to their use across the Islamic world, horseshoe arches became popular in Western countries at the time of the Moorish Revival. They were widely used in Moorish Revival synagogues. Horseshoe arches first appeared in Indo-Islamic architecture in 1311 in the Alai Darwaza gatehouse at the Qutb Complex in Delhi, though they were not a consistent feature in India. They are used in some forms of Indo- Saracenic Revival architecture, a 19th-century style associated with the British Raj.

She acquired her full name after marrying Harvey Fuqua and kept the name after their divorce. Biography =Early life and career= Gwen Gordy was born to Berry Gordy Sr. and Bertha Ida (n√©e Fuller) Gordy in Detroit. She was the youngest of the four Gordy sisters (Esther, Anna and Loucye) and the third youngest of the entire family (brothers Berry and Robert were born after her). Following graduation from high school, Gwen owned the photo concession at Detroit's popular Flame Show Bar, which helped to make her a celebrity in Detroit's nightlife. By the late 1950s, Gordy had also become a cheerleader for brother Berry's musical efforts. She provided Berry with his first important music business contact when she introduced him to the manager of the club, a white man named Al Green. Green managed music stars like Johnnie Ray and LaVern Baker and he had just signed a new singer from Detroit named Jackie Wilson. Green also owned a music publishing company and was looking for new material. She had a songwriting partnership with her brother Berry Gordy and Roquel \\"Billy\\" Davis, a childhood friend who had connections with Chess Records in Chicago. The partners started out with a bang by writing \\"Jim Dandy Got Married\\" for LaVern Baker on the Atlantic label and \\"All I Could Do Was Cry\\" for Etta James on Argo, a Chess subsidiary label. By far, however, their greatest early success was writing the first big hits for Jackie Wilson. Starting with \\"Reet Petite\\", Gwen, Berry and Davis penned five consecutive Jackie Wilson hits. \\"Lonely Teardrops\\", \\"That's Why (I Love You So)\\", \\"To Be Loved\\", and \\"I'll Be Satisfied\\" all established Wilson as one of Rock and Roll's hottest new stars. Gordy earned small pay during this period of her work with Wilson's label Brunswick. Although Berry, Gwen, and Roquel had provided five consecutive hits for Jackie Wilson, they had to split the songwriting royalties three ways. To bring in more income, Berry demanded that some of their songs be used for the B sides on Wilson's recordings. After he was turned down by manager Nat Tarnopol, the trio decided to end their association with Jackie. Gwen Gordy was the first to put the idea of starting a record company into action. She formed a label with Roquel Davis and named the company 'Anna', after her sister. Davis then used his contacts to make a deal with Chess Records to distribute their new Anna label nationally. Gwen and Roquel both wanted Berry to become a partner with them. However, Berry decided to go out on his own. The label helped to distribute the local Tamla Records single, Barrett Strong's \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\", which became a top 40 hit in 1960. That year, Gordy co-wrote the ballad \\"All I Could Do Was Cry\\", which was originally offered to Erma Franklin (Aretha's sister), who almost signed with Anna Records but was rebuffed by her father, C. L. Franklin. The song eventually was sold by Chess Records who recorded the song with Etta James. Shortly after meeting Harvey Fuqua, they founded the labels Harvey Records and Tri-Phi Records, the latter label including The Spinners, who recorded their first hit with the Gordy/Fuqua composition, \\"That's What Girls Are Made For\\". In 1961, Motown absorbed Anna Records, signing Marvin Gaye in the process. The Harvey and Tri-Phi labels were absorbed by Motown two years later after that and Gordy and Fuqua accepted staff jobs with Motown, with Gordy handling business affairs, while Fuqua became a staff writer and producer. Alongside sister Anna, she co-headed Motown's Artist Development course and by the mid-1960s was managing acts such as the Spinners, Shorty Long, Junior Walker & the All Stars and Tammi Terrell, who signed to Motown in 1965. Gordy convinced Motown to allow Terrell to perform duets with Gaye. In 1973, Gordy had hand in adding lyrics to Marvin Gaye's composition, \\"Distant Lover\\", which became a hit single a year later after Motown released a live recording of the song. In 1977, Gordy founded Gwen Glenn Productions and produced for Motown acts such as High Inergy before retiring from the music business in the early 1980s. Personal life Gordy dated fellow composer Billy Davis for a number of years. However, the relationship imploded after Gordy got involved with Harvey Fuqua. Gordy and Fuqua married in 1961 and Gordy was known afterwards as Gwen Gordy Fuqua for the duration of her life, though in 1968, Gordy and Fuqua divorced. After most of the Spinners left Motown for Atlantic Records in 1972, she struck up a romance with ex-Spinners bandmate G.C. Cameron, managed his career and later marrying him. The couple broke up in the late 1970s after Cameron left Motown. Gordy's production company \\"Gwen Glenn\\" was named after Gwen's son Glenn Gordy. Gordy moved to California in the early 1970s, where she'd remained until her death and lived comfortably off royalties after her career ended in the early 1980s. =Death= Gwen succumbed to cancer at her home in San Diego, California on November 8, 1999 at the age of 71. She was buried in Detroit, Michigan.

X-parameters are a generalization of S-parameters and are used for characterizing the amplitudes and relative phase of harmonics generated by nonlinear components under large input power levels. X-parameters are also referred to as the parameters of the Poly-Harmonic Distortion (PHD) nonlinear behavioral model. Description X-parameters represent a new category of nonlinear network parameters for high-frequency design (Nonlinear vector network analyzers are sometimes called large signal network analyzers. ) X-parameters are applicable to both large-signal and small-signal conditions, for linear and nonlinear components. They are an extension of S-parameters meaning that, in the limit of a small signal, X-parameters reduce to S-parameters. They help overcome a key challenge in RF engineering, namely that nonlinear impedance differences, harmonic mixing, and nonlinear reflection effects occur when components are cascaded under large signal operating conditions. This means that there is a nonlinear and as such non-trivial relationship between the properties of the individual cascaded components and the composite properties of the resulting cascade. This situation is unlike that at DC, where one can simply add the values of resistors connected in series. X-parameters help solve this cascading problem: if the X-parameters of a set of components are measured individually, the X-parameters (and hence the non-linear transfer function) can be calculated of any cascade made from them. Calculations based on X-parameters are usually performed within a harmonic balance simulator environment. Development  X-parameters were developed and introduced by Agilent Technologies as functionality included in N5242A Nonlinear Vector Network Analyzer, and the W2200 Advanced Design System in 2008. X-parameters are the parameters of the polyharmonic distortion modeling work of Dr. Jan Verspecht (PDF, 85 KB) (PDF, 2.4MB) and Dr. David E. Root.

The oldest of the Coimbra Polytechnical Institute's (IPC) autonomous institutions, it has also IPC's largest campus. History The ESAC has a long history in vocational education and provision of services to the community started in the nineteenth century as the National School of Agriculture (1899), renamed the Regents School of Agriculture (1950), and finally in the 1970s, the Higher Agrarian School of Coimbra (Escola Superior Agr√°ria de Coimbra), a state-run higher education school of agriculture. It was incorporated into the Polytechnical Institute of Coimbra in the 1980s but preserved wide technical, pedagogical and financial autonomy. It conferred the bacharelato degree and the Diploma de Estudos Especializados (DESE) diploma. In the late 1990s, after the upgrading of the Portuguese polytechnical institutions to bachelor's degree-conferring institutions (the Portuguese licenciatura), the differences between this polytechnical school and the university institutions were drastically reduced, an achievement that would fully materialize after the Bologna Process in 2006/2007. Currently, the ESAC awards a 3-year 1st cycle bachelor's degree (licenciatura); and a 2-year 2nd cycle masters' degree in several fields including biotechnology, food engineering, organic farming, and forest engineering. In addition, ESAC has developed and expanded its own research units and programs. The campus The ESAC is located in the urban area of the city of Coimbra, on a campus with strong rural characteristics, with a significant area of farmland, pasture, forest and infrastructure support for a total of 140 ha. It has a vast architectural heritage, architecture typical of the traditional rural location, including a listed building. The natural heritage of ESAC is also known for its quality and diversity: the region's largest camphor tree, a forest of oaks, and woody teixos, a tash, a Sequoia and species protected by the Habitats Directive. There is also a great faunal diversity including amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, which have been identified as species of community interest. This set of semi-natural areas, infrastructure and equipment can be used in training activities, environmental education and recreation service to the community as the main activities of ESAC focus in teaching, research and services in the areas of agriculture, biotechnology, forestry, environment, agro-industries and eco-agritourism. Research and services to the community The Centro de Estudos de Recursos Naturais, Ambiente e Sociedade (CERNAS) is ESAC's research and development centre. CERNAS develops scientific and technological knowledge in the areas of natural resources, food science, environment and sustainable development, based on multidisciplinary, cross sectoral and horizontal development, promoting research, dissemination of knowledge, training, scientific qualification and technology.CERNAS Sports and student life The Escola Superior Agr√°ria de Coimbra has a notable rugby union department, usually known as Agr√°ria. The rugby team has played in the main Portuguese leagues. The students' union is the Associa√ß√£o de Estudantes da Escola Superior Agr√°ria de Coimbra (AE ESAC) which was founded in 1982 by students.Associa√ß√£o de Estudantes da Escola Superior Agraria de Coimbra Students' Association The Student Association at ESAC was created in 1982 when a group of students of the school decided to form the Association of Students of the Higher School of Agrarian of Coimbra (AE ESAC). Since then, AE ESAC has never stopped. There have been a number of conferences, conferences, meetings, fairs and exhibitions that have taken place, in addition to the nuclei that he has formed, and which demonstrate the openness that the Association has always had in welcoming new ideas and new projects. The Association of Students is elected annually among one or more candidate lists, which must obey two rules: to be students of this school and to be members of AE ESAC. At present, the ESAC Student Association is made up of 25 students from all courses. Throughout the year it is the duty of AE ESAC to receive all students and, above all, to defend their rights, both at the level of the Board of Directors, the Pedagogical Council and the Assembly of Representatives, and the teachers, without, however, making them forget their duties.

He should not be confounded with Sebastian Francisco de Medrano who was also a poet and lived at about the same time. Life Medrano was born in Seville 1570. He entered the Society of Jesus and was ordained a priest in 1594. He abandoned the order in 1602 and died in his hometown 1607.Francisco de Medrano. Works His poetry was influenced by works of Horace and Torquato Tasso. He wrote chiefly sonnets.Francisco de Medrano. Medrano's works were published at Palermo (1617) as an appendix to the imitation of Ovid's \\"Remedia Amoris\\" by Pedro Venegas de Saavedra, a poet of Seville. According to the Spanish critic Adolfo de Castro, Medrano is the best of the Spanish imitators of Horace, comparing favorably in that respect with Luis de Le√≥n. Endowed with literary taste, he writes in good Spanish, and his style is free from the gongorism of his time. Among the odes of Medrano, his \\"La profecia del Tajo\\" is very similar to one of Luis de Le√≥n of the same title. Although both are based upon Horace's ode to Mark Antony in which he would separate him and Cleopatra, there is a great difference between them. L√©on's ode departs from the original of Horace, while Medrano's is an imitation of the latter so close as to amount almost to a translation. The poems of Medrano are reprinted in La biblioteca de autores espa√±oles. Translations Two sonnets by Francisco de Medrano were translated into English by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

Tormented by visions of death and suffering and deciding that murder is the way of things, the young man kills his uncle and builds a wall to hide the body. The young man's torment continues, this time caused by guilt over murdering his uncle, and he becomes sensitive to slight noises, like the tapping of a shoe or the crying of a bird. The ghost of his uncle begins appearing to him and, as he gradually loses his grip on reality, the police figure out what he has done and chase him down. In the ending sequence, we learn that the experience was all a dream and that his uncle is really alive. Cast Scene from The Avenging Conscience * Henry B.

Family  Franz was the only child of the morganatic marriage between Archduke Johann of Austria-Tuscany and Anna Plochl, and a grandson of the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II. On 8 July 1862 at Ottenstein, Germany, he married Countess Theresia von Lamberg, the second child and only daughter of Franz Philipp, Count von Lamberg and his wife, Countess Caroline Hoyos.  Life and career  His father having eloped with his mother (the daughter of a postmaster at Bad Aussee) in defiance of Archduke Johann's brother, Emperor Francis, Franz was entitled to inherit none of his father's positions or entailed possessions. However, the esteem in which his father was held by both emperor and nation as a general and patron of the arts shielded Franz from some of the scandal and consequences of the circumstances of his birth. He was born legitimate but a commoner, and thus he was not permitted to bear the Habsburg-Lorraine surname of his father's dynasty. His mother had been ennobled by the emperor five years after her marriage to the archduke, becoming Baroness (Freifrau) von Brandhofen on 4 July 1834, and Franz shared in her title after his birth. He was raised to comital rank as Count (Graf) von Meran on 29 April 1844 (letters patent issuing 30 December 1845, Vienna). While still a child, he had been designated a Landmann in Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Tyrol and Austria, and was accorded a seat in the Austrian House of Lords on 24 November 1842. After his father's death in 1859 at Palais Meran in Graz, the manors of Schenna, Stainz and Gut Brandhof (near Mariazell) were combined into a fideicommis for him and his future descendants. He served the Habsburg emperors as Imperial and Royal Chamberlain, member of the Aulic Council and as a general in the Imperial army, becoming in 1868 a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. He died at Opatija, Croatia on 27 March 1891, aged 52.  Descendants  Seven children were born from his marriage to Countess Theresia von Lamberg (1836‚Äì1913), and they bore the titles Count/Countess von Meran, Baron/Baroness von Brandhofen and inter-married with prominent families of the Austro- Hungarian nobility: * Countess Anna Maria (1864‚àí1935) * Countess Maria Johanna (1865‚àí1935) * Johann Stephan, Count von Meran (1867‚àí1947), who wed in 1891 his cousin, Countess Ladislaja von Lamberg with whom he had nine children; their grandchildren include conductor Count Nikolaus de la Fontaine und d'Harnoncourt-Unverzagt and politician Karl-Theodor, Baron von und zu Guttenberg * Franz Peter (1868‚àí1949), who in 1902 wed Princess Marie Johanna Franziska, daughter of Prince Louis and Princess Mary of Liechtenstein * Countess Karoline Johanna (1870‚àí1944) * Count Rudolf Johann (1872‚àí1959), who in 1917 wed Princess Johanna von Auersperg, granddaughter of Prince Adolf of Auersperg * Count Albrecht Johann (1874‚àí1928)  References  Further reading * Renate Basch-Ritter, Anna Plochl - Die Frau an der Seite Erzherzog Johanns, Advea Verlag 2005 Category:Barons of Austria Category:Counts of Austria Franz Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria Category:1839 births Category:1891 deaths ","title":"Franz, Count of Meran"},{"id":"20003303","text":"Rainer Brandt (born 19 January 1936) is a German film actor.

The Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull in 1898, directed by Konstantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, was a crucial milestone for the fledgling theatre company that has been described as \\"one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest new developments in the history of world drama.\\"Rudnitsky (1981, 8) and Benedetti (1999, 85). It was the first production in Moscow of Anton Chekhov's 1896 play The Seagull, though it had been performed with only moderate success in St. Petersburg two years earlier. Nemirovich, who was a friend of Chekhov's, overcame the writer's refusal to allow the play to appear in Moscow after its earlier lacklustre reception and convinced Stanislavski to direct the play for their innovative and newly founded Moscow Art Theatre (MAT).Benedetti (1999, 73) and (1989, 25). The production opened on . The MAT's success was due to the fidelity of its delicate representation of everyday life, its intimate, ensemble playing, and the resonance of its mood of despondent uncertainty with the psychological disposition of the Russian intelligentsia of the time.Braun (1981, 64). To commemorate this historic production, which gave the MAT its sense of identity, the company to this day bears the seagull as its emblem.Braun (1981, 62, 64). Cast * Irina Nikolayevna Arkadina: Olga Knipper * Konstantin Gavrilovich Treplyov: Vsevolod Meyerhold * Masha: Maria Lilina * Boris Alexeyevich Trigorin: Konstantin Stanislavski Stanislavski's directorial conception While visiting his brother's estate near Kharkiv in August 1898, Stanislavski began work on his production plan (or his directorial \\"score\\" as he came to call it) for the play, into which he incorporated his sensory experiences of the Russian countryside there.Benedetti (1999, 76). He storyboarded key moments of the play with small drawings that gave the actor's spatial and proxemic relationships. He also detailed individual rhythms, physical lives and mannerisms for each character: The score indicates when the actors will \\"wipe away dribble, blow their noses, smack their lips, wipe away sweat, or clean their teeth and nails with matchsticks.\\"Worrall (1996, 109). This tight control of the mise en sc√®ne was intended to facilitate the unified expression of the inner action that Stanislavski perceived to be hidden beneath the surface of the play in its subtext.Braun (1981, 62-63). Vsevolod Meyerhold, the director and practitioner whom Stanislavski on his death-bed declared to be \\"my sole heir in the theatre‚Äîhere or anywhere else\\", and the actor who played Konstantin in this production, described years later the poetic effect of Stanislavski's treatment of the play:Rudnitsky (1981, xv) and Braun (1982, 62). Stanislavski's directorial score was published in 1938.Benedetti (1999, 79). For an English translation of Stanislavki's score, see Balukhaty (1952). Production process Stanislavski (right) as Trigorin‚Äî\\"elegantly coiffured, clad in evening dress, mournfully contemplating the middle distance with pencil and notepad, suggests someone licked his chin on resurrecting the dead seagull in deathless prose than plotting the casual seduction of the ardent female by his side.\\"Worrall (1996, 107). As an actor, despite wishing to play Trigorin, Stanislavski initially prepared the role of the doctor Dorn, at Nemirovich's insistence.Benedetti (1999, 80). When Chekhov attended rehearsals for the production in September 1898, however, he felt that the performance of Trigorin was weak, which resulted in a re-casting; Stanislavski took over Trigorin and Nemirovich apologised for having kept the role from him.Benedetti (1999, 79-81). Olga Knipper (Chekhov's future wife) played Arkadina.Braun (1982, 62). The production had 80 hours of rehearsal in total, spread over 24 sessions: 9 with Stanislavski and 15 with Nemirovich.Benedetti (1999, 85). Despite this, a considerable length by the standards of the conventional practice of the day, Stanislavski felt it was under-rehearsed and threatened to have his name removed from the posters when Nemirovich refused his demand to postpone its opening by a week. Performance and reception The production opened on with a sense of crisis in the air in the theatre; most of the actors were mildly self-tranquilised with Valerian drops.Benedetti (1999, 85, 386). In a letter to Chekhov, one audience member described how: Nemirovich described the applause, which came after a prolonged silence, as bursting from the audience like a dam breaking.Benedetti (1999, 86). The production received unanimous praise from the press. It was not until that Chekhov saw the production, in a performance without sets but in make-up and costumes at the Paradiz Theatre.Benedetti (1999, 89). He praised the production but was less keen on Stanislavski's own performance; he objected to the \\"soft, weak-willed tone\\" in his interpretation (shared by Nemirovich) of Trigorin and entreated Nemirovich to \\"put some spunk into him or something\\".Benedetti (1999, 89-90) and Worrall (1996, 108). He proposed that the play be published with Stanislavski's score of the production's mise en sc√®ne.Benedetti (1999, 90). Chekhov's collaboration with Stanislavski proved crucial to the creative development of both men. Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the play and revived Chekhov's interest in writing for the stage. Chekhov's unwillingness to explain or expand on the script forced Stanislavski to dig beneath the surface of the text in ways that were new in theatre.Chekhov and the Art Theatre, in Stanislavski's words, were united in a common desire \\"to achieve artistic simplicity and truth on the stage\\"; Allen (2001, 11).

The house was built by Charles Samuel Richter, the president of the Montello Granite Company. It is sited on a hill overlooking both Montello Lake and Buffalo Lake. The plans were drawn in 1908, and construction lasted three years until it was completed in 1912. The house has thick walls with granite on the exterior and cinderblock in the middle. The two round pillars around the front entrance are solid granite, and required six months of mechanical polishing to make them perfect. The interior has hardwood floors, 54 leaded glass windows, stained glass above the bookcases on either side of the fireplace, and a curved open stairway in the foyer. At the time it was built, it was billed as the only granite house in the world. It was designed by architects Parkinson & Dockendorff.

It seems however, that he was born in Graz, Styria.Seckauer Kirchenschmuck, 1880, p. 56 He worked on the choir of the Freiburg Minster from 1471 to 1480; in the latter year he was compelled to leave the task of building and to swear that he would not try to revenge himself for this. In 1480 he worked on St. Leonhard's Church in Basle; in 1482, on the Strasbourg Cathedral; and in the following year he probably was engaged on the Milan Cathedral with a yearly salary of 180 guilders.There is a \\"Johannes of Graz\\" mentioned as architect in Ricci, Storia dell' archit. italiana, II, 388 The choir at Freiburg was turned over to him in 1471; the contract is interesting and instructive showing as it does the manner in which buildings of this kind were erected during the latter part of the Middle Ages, and how the working hours, wages, etc. were determined upon.Schreiber, M√ºnster zu Freiburg, Appendix, 15 sq. The choir possesses great beauty, but it also manifests the peculiarities of Late Gothic architecture. It is long, like the main church, with the nave higher, the side aisles lower and somewhat narrower than in the front, and surrounded by twelve chapels, enclosed on two sides by fluted columns. The arched roof, supported by beautifully carved columns, forms a network. The windows are characteristically Late Gothic, and the arches are wonderfully delicate.

Dead Oceans is a label included in Secretly Group, which also includes Secretly Canadian and Jagjaguwar. Secretly Group includes the three record labels as well as a music publisher known as Secretly Publishing, representing artists, writers, filmmakers, producers, and comedians. History In 2007, Phil Waldorf left Misra Records after nearly a decade of managing the label to form Dead Oceans with Chris Swanson, Ben Swanson, Darius Van Arman, and Jonathan Cargill of Secretly Canadian and Jagjaguwar.Austin Powell, \\"Dead Oceans Making Waves\\" Austin Chronicle, October 19, 2007.Dave Maher, \\"Secretly Canadian/Jagjaguwar Birth Dead Oceans\\" Pitchfork Media, February 19, 2007. Before becoming the head of Dead Oceans, Waldorf was a Virginia native with a teenage love of skateboarding and punk rock seven-inches. He left home to go to college in Athens, Georgia, where he worked at the college radio station, WUOG, as their music director, and in the city's underground music scene. While there, Waldorf came to know future indie bands Neutral Milk Hotel and Olivia Tremor Control in their formative years, going to early house shows before both bands rose to underground fame. In 1998, Waldorf moved to New York City when he was hired by the iconic record store, Other Music. While working at Other Music, Waldorf also managed an indie label, Misra Records. After some time, Chris Swanson and Waldorf became friends and began talking about the possibility of working together. After deciding to partner on a new label, Chris Swanson suggested the name Dead Oceans. The name is lifted from the lyrics of Bob Dylan's ‚ÄúA Hard Rain‚Äôs a-Gonna Fall‚Äù (1962): ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans I‚Äôve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard And it‚Äôs a hard, and it‚Äôs a hard, it‚Äôs a hard, and it‚Äôs a hard And it‚Äôs a hard rain‚Äôs a-gonna fall.‚Äù In 2007, Waldorf officially started Dead Oceans with the Swanson brothers, Van Arman, and Cargill. The addition of Dead Oceans to Secretly Canadian and Jagjaguwar's partnership led to the formation of Secretly Group. As the label began, some of their earliest releases include titles such as Phosphorescent's Pride, Dirty Projectors‚Äô Rise Above, and Akron/Family's Set ‚ÄòEm Wild, Set ‚ÄòEm Free ‚Äì ranging from folk to art punk to groove-y rock. Since then, Dead Oceans has grown to include Julianna Barwick, Mitski, Phoebe Bridgers, Japanese Breakfast, Ryley Walker, The Tallest Man on Earth, Kevin Morby, Marlon Williams, and many others. In 2015, Secretly Group began a partnership with The Numero Group as well. In 2017, the label released Nineties shoegaze band Slowdive‚Äôs return to the industry with their first album after a 22 year hiatus. In 2018, Dead Oceans was listed as #7 on Paste Magazine's top 10 record labels of 2018. Jagjaguwar was listed as #4 and Secretly Canadian was listed as #8.

Many of the city's historic markets date to the mid-to-late 19th century, as the city was experiencing rapid growth due to the creation of the Eixample. Each neighborhood has at least one market and many have up to 4. Markets in the city are typically large enclosed spaces located centrally in the neighborhoods they serve. The larger markets are arranged into departments depending on the product. In addition, there exist many non- food based markets around the city, such as those that offer art or secondhand goods. The city's oldest markets are located in the Ciutat Vella and Eixample, with newer markets along the fringes of the city. Many of the older markets, such as La Boqueria, not only provide food and goods for their surrounding neighborhoods, but are tourist attractions in their own right, as they provide an essential glimpse into everyday life in the city. The markets are administered under the Mercats Municipals de Barcelona wing of the city's government. La Boqueria Fruit at La Boqueria The Boqueria is the most well known market in the city of Barcelona. It houses the best and most well known producers and specializes in the sale of fresh produce, seafood, meats (specifically Jam√≥n Iberico) and tapas. Also well known are the candies and fresh juices found on the Rambla side of the market. The first known mention of the Boqueria came in 1217, when meat sales began to take place near the old door to the city. In December 1470, the marketplace began to specialize in the sale of pigs. These transitions came and passed as the marketplace functioned under the names El Mercat Bornet and El Mercat de la Palla (Straw Market) until 1794 when it began to be referred to as the Boqueria. The market was still unenclosed and functioning as an extension of the Mercat de Placa Nova until the government decided to make it an independent market off the Rambla for the sale of meats and fish. In 1826, it was legally recognized. On March 19, 1840, construction began under the direction of architect Mas Vil√†. The market opened in the same year but was not officially inaugurated until 1854. In 1911, the new fish market opened and in 1914, the metal roof, which still covers the market, was built. Mercat de Sant Antoni The front of the Mercat Sant Antoni The Mercat de Sant Antoni is one of the largest markets in the city of Barcelona. It was built according to Ildefonso Cerd√†‚Äôs original, nature-based city plan (Greek-cross style plan inset in a larger square) by Antoni Rovira i Tras in 1882 in a triangle of Eixample blocks in between El Raval and Poble Sec. The metal structure covers an entire block of the Raval. Items sold include fresh produce, meats and fish. It is known for its book and coin market that is held outside on Sundays. In 2015, the market building closed for renovations, and the market itself is housed in a temporary building next door until 2017. Mercat de Santa Caterina The newly renovated Mercat de Santa Caterina Located in La Ribera just off the Via Laietana, the Mercat de Santa Caterina has been in operation since 1848. It was recently remodeled in 2005 by Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue. The remodel included a roof in the form of a multicolored ceramic wave, which sits atop the wooden walls that enclose the market. During the remodeling, the market was relocated to the stretch of the Passeig de Sant Joan in between the Arc de Triomf and the city's Parc de la Ciutadella.http://www.mercatsbcn.com/mercats/index.php?fuseaction=historia&id;_mercat=29 The market now serves an area also previously served by the Mercat del Born, which has been converted into an archaeological site preserving the foundations of the older neighborhood underneath its roof. Inside are numerous food stalls as well as restaurants. Mercat de la Barceloneta The Mercat de la Barceloneta, like the Mercat de Santa Caterina dates from 1848. While originally an open-air market, it has since been enclosed. Mercat de la Concepci√≥ Mercat de la Concepci√≥ The Mercat de la Concepci√≥ is well known for its flowers. Built in 1888 by Antoni Rovira i Trias, this Eixample market, which spans an entire block, was constructed using iron, a revolutionary new architectural form that gained prominence around this time. It was completely remodeled in 1998 due to its outdated nature and lack of necessary amenities. Some of the improvements included reorganizing the market, evolving its offerings, adding new technology, and improving basic elements of the market such as parking availability.http://www.mercatsbcn.com/mercats/index.php?fuseaction=historia&id;_mercat=10 Mercat del Ninot The Mercat del Ninot is located in the western portion of the Eixample. Its current building dates from 1933.http://www.mercatsbcn.com/mercats/index.php?fuseaction=historia&id;_mercat=24 Mercat d'Hostafrancs Mercat d'Hostafrancs The Mercat d'Hostafrancs is one of the larger markets in the western part of the city. It is located near Montjuic. Mercat de Sants Located in the Sants district, this market dates from 1913http://www.mercatsbcn.com/mercats/index.php?fuseaction=historia&id;_mercat=34 Mercat del Fort Pienc The Mercat del Fort Pienc is one of the city's newest markets, dating from 2003 Mercat de Poblenou One of the few markets serving the Poblenou area, the Mercat de Poblenou has served its neighborhood since 1913.http://www.mercatsbcn.com/mercats/index.php?fuseaction=historia&id;_mercat=38 Pintors del Pi Market Pintors Pi Market One of the most famous art markets in the city of Barcelona is the Mercadillo de la Placa de Sant Josep, also known as the Pintors del Pi market. Situated in the Placa de Sant Josep Oriol i Pi just under the church of Santa Maria del Pi, the market began in the 1970s when a group of Catalan artists decided to meet up to bring art to the streets of the city. Many different types of art are represented, including watercolors and oils, and representations vary from cityscapes to portraits. The market opens every weekend and usually showcases around 15 artists. El Mercat dels Encants El Mercat dels Encants is Barcelona‚Äôs biggest and most recognized secondhand market. This newly renovated market next to Las Glorias Square is well known for its aggressive architectural style. Ferm√≠n V√°squez Arquitectos, the group that designed the building, did not want the building to appear as a shopping center. This led to the design of a wall-less, continuous space, with ramps and elevated ‚Äúfloors‚Äù that loop around the entire structure. Notable items include furniture, clothing and books on the upper floors, and the second-hand items are primarily on the ground floor level. The market is open on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. El Mercat Gotic El Mercat Gotic is an antique market located in the gothic quarter of Barcelona, next to the Catedral de Santa Eul√†lia. The market showcases secondhand items, mostly art pieces. Some notable items include ceramics, candles, dolls and other rare objects. The market opens every Thursday except in August. Fira de Nadal de la Sagrada Familia The Fira de Nadal de la Sagrada Familia is an annual open-air Christmas market that has been held at the Sagrada Familia since 1960, normally from November 29 to December 23. Items sold include Christmas trees, figurines, toys, gifts, food, and art. The market is popular among families with children due to the appearance of Santa Claus.

Early life and military service Yu was born in Ji'an, Jiangxi, in 1914, three years after the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty, into a poor peasant family. By the age of 14 he had taken part in a peasant uprising. At 16 he joined the Chinese Communist Party. Yu was among the tens of thousands of guerrillas and their supporters who from 1934 joined the Long March in an effort to break through the Kuomintang blockades around the Communist base in the south. In 1936, he was injured in the arm during a skirmish with pursuing nationalist forces. He continued on the journey north over treacherous terrain. Nine months later, after he had completed a journey of thousands of miles in terrible pain, his arm was amputated. \\"I am a man who has gone through nine deaths,\\" Yu told the American journalist Harrison Salisbury in 1984. From November 1936 to August 1937, he received advanced military and political training at the Counter- Japanese Military and Political University.‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëËß£ÊîæÂÜõ„Ää‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëËß£ÊîæÂÜõÈ´òÁ∫ßÂ∞ÜÈ¢Ü‰º†„ÄãÁºñÂÆ°ÂßîÂëò‰ºöÔºå‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∏≠ÂÖ±ÂÖöÂè≤‰∫∫Áâ©Á†îÁ©∂‰ºö„Ää‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëËß£ÊîæÂÜõÈ´òÁ∫ßÂ∞ÜÈ¢Ü‰º†„ÄãÁºñÊí∞ÂßîÂëò‰ºöÁºñ. ‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëËß£ÊîæÂÜõÈ´òÁ∫ßÂ∞ÜÈ¢Ü‰º† Á¨¨24Âç∑.

Early People's Republic After the Communist victory in 1949, Yu Qiuli was transferred to the Southwest, serving as a member of the Standing Committee of the Party Committee of the Western Sichuan District of the Communist Party of China and as the Principal and Political Commissar of the Senior Infantry School. In December 1954, he was called to Beijing and was named Director of the General Finance Department of the PLA, holding that position until early 1957, when he became Director of the PLA General Logistics Department. In September 1955, he was awarded the rank of lieutenant general. Petroleum Industry In February 1958, he became Minister for the Petroleum Industry, and decided to focus on oilfield exploration. This move thrust him into a far more prominent role in the Communist government. In the following year, the discovery of huge oil reserves in Daqing in the desolate wastes of north-eastern China gave him a mission that on its own would ensure his place in Communist China's history books. Yu's task was to turn Daqing into a model of Chinese industry. Under Yu's direction, the mosquito-infested marshland - in winter an expanse of ice - was transformed into China's biggest oil production centre. Daqing was written into the Communist lexicon as a name synonymous with proletarian heroism. It produced the famous Maoist icon Iron Man Wang, who, in order to stop a blow-out, leapt into a pool of liquid concrete to mix it using his own body. After his success in Daqing, Yu went on to establish several more major production centres. In 1964, China declared itself self-sufficient in oil. That year, Yu was moved into the most important government ministry related to the economy, the State Planning Commission, as deputy chief. In 1965, Mao made him the top drafter of the third Five Year Plan and put him in charge of relocating major industries to the remote hinterland of south-western China. Despite the claim of his official biographer that Yu suffered severe persecution during the tumultuous Cultural Revolution that began in 1966, he appears to have suffered less harm than many of his colleagues. In 1975, he was appointed Vice Premier, as was Deng Xiaoping. After the death of Mao in 1976, Yu was promoted to the ruling Politburo. He was a member of what is commonly referred to as the \\"petroleum faction\\", a group of senior officials who advocated using the profits from petroleum exports to finance high technology imports from the West and Japan. These officials were essentially Stalinists in their economic thinking, favoring central planning and heavy industry - a strategy that clashed with that of the ascendant Deng. As Deng's political fortunes rose in the late 1970s, those of the petroleum faction waned. Yu was forced to make a self-criticism after the collapse of a Japanese-made oil rig in the Bohai Gulf in 1979, and in 1980 he was transferred from the chairmanship of the State Planning Commission to the less high-profile post of head of the State Energy Commission. Political overseer of the PLA In 1982, however, Yu was back in uniform, as Deng named him Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission and Director of the PLA General Political Department, a position of massive influence in the PLA, being responsible for checking and ensuring the political reliability and loyalty of all military personnel, and often described as \\"Military Grand Inquisitor\\".Whitson, William and Huang Chen-hsia, The Chinese High Command: A History of Military Politics, 1927-71 (Praeger, New York: 1973) p. 255, 550. Yu held these posts until 1987, when he retired.‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëËß£ÊîæÂÜõ„Ää‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëËß£ÊîæÂÜõÈ´òÁ∫ßÂ∞ÜÈ¢Ü‰º†„ÄãÁºñÂÆ°ÂßîÂëò‰ºöÔºå‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∏≠ÂÖ±ÂÖöÂè≤‰∫∫Áâ©Á†îÁ©∂‰ºö„Ää‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëËß£ÊîæÂÜõÈ´òÁ∫ßÂ∞ÜÈ¢Ü‰º†„ÄãÁºñÊí∞ÂßîÂëò‰ºöÁºñ. ‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëËß£ÊîæÂÜõÈ´òÁ∫ßÂ∞ÜÈ¢Ü‰º† Á¨¨24Âç∑.

The story deals with a plant monster that is ultimately revealed to have formed around a human skeleton, specifically that of Roger Kirk, in a swamp. P. Schuyler Miller described \\"It\\" as \\"probably the most unforgettable story ever published in Unknown. \\"\\"Book Reviews\\", Astounding Science Fiction, September 1949, p.151  Similar characters  The Heap battles \\"The Man of the Moonlight\\" on the cover of Airboy Comics, volume 9, number 5 (March, 1952). Artwork by Ernest Schroeder. Plant-based swamp monsters similar to that in the story appear in various comic books. Among these characters are Hillman Comics' the Heap in Airboy Comics, who debuted in what was intended as a one-time appearance in the feature \\"Skywolf\\" in Air Fighters #3 (December 1942). Early depictions of the Heap look highly similar to the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies character Gossamer, an orange-furred, practically featureless monster in sneakers who menaced Bugs Bunny in the 1946 animated short \\"Hair-Raising Hare\\" before going on to other appearances (and named \\"Rudolph\\" in one). Solomon Grundy in All-American Comics is the result of a criminal having fallen in a swamp, though he did not have a plant-like appearance. Sturgeon's story continued to show influence after the relaxation of the Comics Code Authority's restrictions on horror late in 1971. The Man- Thing first appeared (in an unrestricted black and white magazine-size comic) from Marvel Comics in May 1971, and DC Comics introduced the Swamp Thing in the anthology comic House of Secrets #92 in June 1971. A different character, based upon the House of Secrets story and also called the Swamp Thing, debuted in issue #1 of its own title (November 1971). Marvel also published an adaptation of the original story in Supernatural Thrillers #1.http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/ittheodoresturgeon.htm Tony Isabella and Roy Thomas were asked by Marvel's editors to consider an ongoing series with Sturgeon's swamp creature, but they felt the similarity to Marvel's own title, The Man-Thing, would create conflicts. The 1980s saw the introduction of Bog Swamp Demon and two Swamp Thing movies, as well as Dave Sim's Man-Thing and Swamp Thing parodies, Woman-Thing and Sump-Thing, in the pages of Cerebus. The 1990s introduced more parodies, including Swamp Beast in Harvey Comics' Monster in My Pocket and Man-Thang and Swamp-Thang in Marvel's What The--?!.

First published in 80CE, it contains critical essays on natural science and Chinese mythology, philosophy, and literature. Name The title Lunheng combines lun Ë´ñ or ËÆ∫ \\"discuss; talk about; discourse; decide on; determine; mention; regard; consider\\" and heng Ë°° \\"crosswise; balance beam; weigh; measure; judge; appreciate\\". English translations of the title include \\"Disquisitions\\" (Alfred Forke), \\"Critical Essays\\" (Fung Yu-lan), \\"The Balanced Inquiries\\" (Wing-tsit Chan), or \\"Discourses Weighed in the Balance\\" (Joseph Needham). Text The received Lunheng comprises 85 pian ÁØá \\"articles; sections; chapters\\" in 30 juan Â∑ª \\"scrolls; volumes; books\\", with more than 200,000 characters. Actually, 84 pian is more accurate because the text only contains the title of Chapter 44 Zhaozhi ÊãõËá¥. Yang Wenchang (Ê•äÊñáÊòå) edited the first printed Lunheng edition, which was the basis for subsequent editions. Its 1045 CE preface notes that Yang compared 2 complete and 7 partial textual copies and corrected 11,259 characters. \\"No commentaries to the Lun heng appear to have been written before the nineteenth century,\\" write Pokora and Loewe (1993:311), which is unusual among Chinese classics. The first Lunheng commentators were Yu Yue (1821‚Äì1907), Sun Yirang (1848‚Äì1908), and Yang Shoujing (1839‚Äì1915). History Based on internal evidence, Forke (1907:9) concludes the Later Han Dynasty Lunheng text \\"must date\\" from the years 76-84 CE. Chapter 38 (ÈΩä‰∏ñ \\"The Equality of the Ages\\", tr. Forke 1907:480) says, \\"Our present sage and enlightened sovereign is continuing the blessings and the prosperity of the reigns of\\" Emperor Guangwu (r. 25-57 CE) and Emperor Ming (r. 58-75 CE), which implies the period of Emperor Zhang (r. 75-88 CE). Chapter 30 (Ë¨õÁëû \\"Arguments on Ominous Creatures\\", tr. Forke 1907:372) notes it was completed during the Jianchu Âª∫Âàù era (76-84 CE). Fung (1953:151) notes the Lunheng \\"was probably completed\\" during the years 82 and 83 CE. \\"The authenticity of the work has not been brought into question\\", write Pokora and Loewe (1993:309), and the text \\"may possibly have been completed between 70 and 80\\", based upon collections of Wang's earlier writings or essays. Content The contents of the Lunheng are summarized by Pokora and Loewe. > In discussing natural phenomena and their implications or causes, matters of > popular belief and misconception and political issues, the book is often > written in polemical form. A controversial statement is made, to be followed > by the author's critical rebuttal, which is often supported by quotations > from earlier writings. In many ways the Lun heng may be regarded as an > encyclopaedic collection of the claims and beliefs of Chinese religion, > thought and folklore. (1993:313) Wang's Lunheng frequently espouses Daoist notions of naturalism. For example, Chapter 54 Ziran Ëá™ÁÑ∂ \\"Spontaneity\\" says. > By the fusion of the fluids [qi] of Heaven and Earth all things of the world > are produced spontaneously, just as by the mixture of the fluids of husband > and wife children are born spontaneously. Among the things thus produced, > creatures with blood in their veins are sensitive of hunger and cold. Seeing > that grain can be eaten, they use it as food, and discovering that silk and > hemp can be worn, they take it as raiment. Some people are of opinion that > Heaven produces grain for the purpose of feeding mankind, and silk and hemp > to cloth them. That would be tantamount to making Heaven the farmer of man > or his mulberry girl [who feeds the silkworms], it would not be in > accordance with spontaneity, therefore this opinion is very questionable and > unacceptable. > Reasoning on Taoist principles we find that Heaven [tian] emits its fluid > everywhere. Among the many things of this world grain dispels hunger, and > silk and hemp protect from cold. For that reason man eats grain, and wears > silk and hemp. That Heaven does not produce grain, silk, and hemp purposely, > in order to feed and cloth[e] mankind, follows from the fact that by > calamitous changes it does not intend to reprove man. Things are produced > spontaneously, and man wears and eats them; the fluid changes spontaneously, > and man is frightened by it, for the usual theory is disheartening. Where > would be spontaneity, if the heavenly signs were intentional, and where > inaction [wu wei]? (tr. Forke 1907:92, cf. Fung 1953:152 and Chan 1963:296) References *Chan, Wing-Tsit. 1963.

Federalism in Nigeria can be traced to Sir Frederick Lord Lugard , when the Northern and Southern protectorates were amalgamated in 1914.  Before and right after independence  Federalism is a system of government in which governmental powers that exists in a country are shared between central government and component region. It is also defined as the system of government in which governmental powers are shared between the component units and the central government, i.e. the federal government and its components (state and local government). Bernard Bourdillon the Governor- general at that time initiated and laid the foundation of federalism in Nigeria in 1939 by creating three provinces. He later handed over the constitution to his successor Arthur Richards and it became the Richards Constitution of 1946. At the beginning of formal British indirect rule in 1901, Nigeria was divided into two regions: Northern and Southern, both of which were divided into provinces. From 1901 to 1958, the number of regions was increased to three through both acquisition of territories and partition from existing provinces. However, while native-born chiefs and clerks were appointed to govern the provinces, the regions were governed by the British- appointed colonial authorities, and such regions were made dependent upon the colonial authorities for martial law, manpower and management of resources. With the approach of independence, power over the regions was given to Nigerian-born citizens, and regional legislatures were established. By the time that Nigeria had declared itself a republic and replaced the post of Governor-General with the post of President, a national bicameral parliament was established and the country was considered a federation of the three regions. The Mid-Western Region was formed from the Western Region in 1966, and Lagos, the capital, was effectively governed as an unofficial fourth region outside the bounds of the Western Region.  First coup, counter-coup and the new states  After the first coup and under the short-lived military government of Aguiyi-Ironsi, Nigeria was reorganized under a central government. Following the counter-coup which resulted in Aguiyi-Ironsi's deposition and assassination, Nigeria was reorganized as a federal country, with three of the regions being divided into newer entities and all first- level subdivisions being renamed as states: * Eastern Region was divided into East-Central (Enugu), Rivers (Port Harcourt), and South-Eastern (Calabar) states; * Northern Region was divided into Benue-Plateau (Jos), Kano (Kano), Kwara (Ilorin), North-Central (Kaduna), North-Eastern (Maiduguri), and North- Western (Sokoto) states * Western Region was divided into Lagos (Lagos) and Western (Ibadan) states. Mid-Western and the states of former Eastern Region made a bid to secede from Nigeria as the states of Biafra and Republic of Benin, resulting in the Nigerian Civil War.  1976  In 1976, six years after the end of the civil war, the states were further reorganized: * Benue- Plateau state divided into Benue (Makurdi) and Plateau states; * East-Central state divided into Anambra and Imo (Owerri) states; * Federal Capital Territory (Abuja) formed from parts of Niger and Plateau states; * North- Eastern state divided into Bauchi (Bauchi), Borno, and Gongola (Yola) states; * Niger (Minna) state split from Sokoto; * Western state divided into Ogun (Abeokuta), Ondo (Akure), and Oyo states State boundaries and names were also reorganized.  1987/1989  States of Nigeria from 1987-1991 * Akwa Ibom state split from Cross River; * Katsina state split from Kaduna  1991-1996  States of Nigeria from 1991-1996 * Abia State split from Imo; * Bendel State divided into Delta and Edo; * Enugu State split from Anambra; * Gongola State divided into Adamawa and Taraba; * Jigawa State split from Kano; * Kebbi State split from Sokoto; * Kogi State formed from parts of Benue and Kwara; * Osun State split from Oyo; * Yobe State split from Borno.  1996-Till date  * Bayelsa State was split from Rivers; * Ebonyi State was formed from parts of Abia and Enugu; * Ekiti State was split from Ondo; * Gombe State was split from Bauchi; * Nasarawa State was split from Plateau; * Zamfara State was split from Sokoto. Causes for, and effects of federalism =Causes for federalism= The demand for the creation of newer states in Nigeria tends to emanate from sub-state groups, often ethnic- or tribal-interest groups, which accuse the current larger state governments of subverting or ignoring the interests and necessities of the more local regions. =Effects of Federalism, Nigerian styled.= A much-criticized effect of the current type of federalism, of 36 states from previous pre civil war 3 regions is the creation of a political subclass of state bureaucracies, often headed by governors who are accused of and sometimes successfully prosecuted for, monetary corruption. Furthermore, one of the outstanding peculiarities of Nigerian politics emanates from the promulgation of sharia law in the northern states, which is only applicable to Muslim residents, while Nigerian states outside the \\"sharia zone\\" operate their legal systems by common and customary law.

Central banks are often blamed for causing malinvestments, such as the dot-com bubble and the United States housing bubble. Austrian economists such as the Swedish central bank's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureate F. A. Hayek advocate the idea that malinvestment occurs due to the combination of fractional reserve banking and artificially low interest rates misleading relative price signals which eventually necessitate a corrective contraction‚Äîa boom followed by a bust.Larry J.

The team ran into serious financial problems after the 2009‚Äì10 season and was stopped. They previously played in the Portuguese Second Division Serie A and finished in 3rd place during the 2007/08 season. They will continue to play their home games in 2012‚Äì13 in Est√°dio Municipal da Coutada with a capacity of 4,000. The local town government, according to an article in an August weekly edition of the \\"Noticias dos Arcos\\", had donated 20,000 euros to help start the team's return to the districts league of Viana do Castelo. According to the website zerozero.pt, the 2012‚Äì13 roster features a number of players from local clubs such as Ponte De Barca and Proselense. The schedule for 2012‚Äì13 has not yet been announced by the regional federation. Prior to the club stopping, they successfully competed and during the 2008‚Äì09 Portuguese Cup they reached as far as the quarterfinals before losing in penalty kicks to First Division Club Nacional da Madeira. This match, which was moved from the Coutada Stadium to the new regional stadium in Melgaco, disappointed many followers who did not want to travel during a weekday to a remote location, which became necessary in order for it to be televised. Outside of hosting First Division Club Sport Lisboa e Benfica in a Portuguese Cup match in the early 1980s, the match against Nacional was the most important of the current generation.

The hall was the centre of a sizeable estate but subsequently fell into disrepair. The ruins are now listed, and form part of Wycoller Country Park. History The dining hall in 1650. In the engraving the arrangements of the room have been reversed. The dining hall today. Above the arch the shields can still be seen as they were in the above engraving. Wycoller Hall dates back to the end of the 16th century, and was built upon the site of a house occupied in 1507 by Piers Hartley. By the 1590s a substantial house had been built, probably sometime in the mid 16th century, replacing Piers' original dwelling. The estate then came into the possession of the Cunliffe family, after the marriage of Pier's daughter Elizabeth to Nicholas Cunliffe in 1611. They had a number of children, one of whom, John, married Grace Hartley in 1628. The Cunliffes settled at Wycoller in the 1720s, after losing their ancestral home to debts. The estate then passed through several brothers, all of whom died without issue, before passing to the grandson of one of the sisters, Henry Owen, on the condition that Owen took the name Cunliffe. He took the name Henry Owen Cunliffe, and became the new squire. He embarked on a large building project for the hall, to create a home that he felt would be worthy of his position, and that would attract a new wife. The building project took over a year to complete, during which time Henry moved out and lodged at the nearby public house. The work included the fitting of a new porch, a large range of mullioned windows, and the modernisation of the interiors. By the time it was complete Henry had married and the couple moved into the hall to enjoy their new lifestyle. Henry was however a keen sportsman and gambler, and ran up heavy debts. On his death in 1818 the property passed to his nephew, Charles Cunliffe Owen, but Charles could not afford to pay off the debts, and the estate was parcelled off to the creditors. The hall passed to a distant relative, John Oldham, and then to the Rev. John Roberts Oldham. The latter arranged for large parts of the stonework to be sold off to build a cotton mill at Trawden. Despite this, much of the hall survived into the late 19th century, though it was unoccupied and steadily crumbling, with considerable amounts of the stonework being removed for local buildings. The entire village subsequently passed into the ownership of the local Water Board, but continued to decline. A local conservation group, 'The Friends of Wycoller' was founded in 1948, and began a campaign to conserve the historic village. Their work on the hall included the restoration of the fireplace in the 1950s. The entire area was sold in 1973 to Lancashire County Council, which declared the entire village a conservation area, and designated the surrounding as a Country Park. The ruins of the hall were designated as a scheduled monument and are Grade II* listed. An exhibition about the history of the hall, the village, and the surrounding area was established in the aisled barn close to the ruins. Design The house had a grand two storey porch, which had been removed in the 1870s and re-erected in Trawden. The porch led into the great hall, dominated by a large stone fireplace. On the right is a key hole shaped opening, the function of which is still unknown. The part of the house rebuilt in the time of Henry Owen Cunliffe was three storeys high, and contained the drawing and sitting rooms, and the bedrooms. Behind the main hall were the kitchens. Beyond the main building of Wycoller Hall was a courtyard with coach-house and stables. Gardens were laid out in Henry Owen Cunliffe's period of occupancy, as was a cock pit. During the last years of occupancy the house was divided in two and lived in by two different families. Wycoller in Literature The seasonal celebrations shown in the above engraving are the subject of Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem Christmas in the Olden Time, 1650 (Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836). Wycoller and the Bront√´s Wycoller Hall is thought to be the inspiration for Ferndean Manor in Charlotte Bront√´'s Jane Eyre. The Bront√´s lived in the nearby village of Haworth, and the family probably visited Wycoller on their walks. Parallels have also been drawn with the owner of Ferndean, Mr Rochester's father, and Henry Owen Cunliffe. One of the occupants of the hall, Elizabeth Cunliffe, also became Elizabeth Eyre through marriage. Wycoller Hall was even used to illustrate the cover of the 1898 edition of Jane Eyre. Ghosts at Wycoller Ruins of the Hall =The phantom horseman= Wycoller and Wycoller Hall also became the site of several ghost stories. One such concerns the murder of the wife of one of the squires of the hall, one Simon Cunliffe. During the reign of King Charles II the squire and his hunt were pursuing a fox. The fox ran into the hall and up into the woman's chamber. The hounds pursued it and attacked it, with Simon Cunliffe riding his horse into the hall and up the stairs. Finding his wife terrified at the scene, he cursed her cowardice and raised his hunting crop as if to strike her. She then died of fright. The squire is supposedly still seen at night returning to the hall, dressed in the costume of the early Stuart era. The noise of his horse clattering across the bridge and up to the hall door, and then up the stairs can be heard, followed by a woman's screams. The ghost then returns the way he came. He supposedly is seen once a year, during stormy weather when darkness has fallen. Paranormal Investigators Colin Veacock and Peter Crawley recorded a sound similar to a riding crop on 26 July 1996. The murdered woman herself is recorded to have appeared once to two lovers at the hall. The ghost wore a black silk dress and foretold the downfall of the Cunliffes and the ruin of the hall. She was later seen by two workmen, but has not been seen since the death of the last Cunliffe of Wycoller. Despite the compelling nature of the stories, there never was a Simon Cunliffe as squire of Wycoller. =Black Bess= Another of the Cunliffes was said to have travelled to the West Indies, where he married a West Indian woman. On the return voyage he began to have second thoughts of the suitability of his marriage, so he threw his wife overboard, where she drowned. The ghost of the woman followed him back to Wycoller, in search of her murderer.

The park sits at the northwest corner of East 9th Street and Lakeside Avenue, adjacent to Cleveland City Hall, and is within the boundaries of the Cleveland Mall historic district. It is the location of the public sculpture Free Stamp, and is the home of the original Cleveland Fire Fighters Memorial. Free Stamp The Free Stamp is an outdoor sculpture located in Willard Park. Created by Claes Oldenburg and his wife Coosje van Bruggen, it has been called the \\"world's largest rubber stamp\\". The dimensions of the sculpture are by by . The sculpture depicts a rubber stamp with the word \\"FREE\\" in its stamping area. The Free Stamp by Claes Oldenburg and his wife Coosje van Bruggen. The work was commissioned by Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio) in 1982 for display at its soon-to-be-constructed headquarters building on Public Square, which became the BP Tower. The piece was originally designed to stand upright, with the lettering of the stamp hidden from view on its \\"stamp pad\\". According to one of the executives working with Oldenburg, the message on the stamp was intended as a reference to the Civil War-era Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, located across the street.Quote from Nicholas Giorganni, project director for Sohio Building, at World's Largest Rubber Stamp, RoadsideAmerica.com. Retrieved Dec. 5, 2009. In an interview with WKYC-TV at the sculpture's 1991 dedication, Oldenburg said the stamp's message, \\"Free,\\" referred to the emancipation of American slaves during and after the Civil War. Sohio had previously been acquired by BP, and BP executive Robert Horton took over the management of Sohio before the sculpture was installed. He believed that the stamp was \\"inappropriate\\" for the location, and that Oldenburg actually intended to mock BP about Sohio's loss of corporate freedom and the lack of freedom in office work. The company gave the artists permission to move the sculpture to another part of the city, but they refused. As a result, the stamp was placed in storage in a facility in Whiting, Indiana. Over the next several years, BP, the artists, and the city consulted to find a new site for the sculpture. Several sites were proposed, including the Cleveland Museum of Art. The artists, who wanted the sculpture to remain near Public Square, finally chose Willard Park. In 1991, BP donated the sculpture to the city of Cleveland. The stamp was modified to sit on its side, and it was dedicated in its new location on November 15, 1991. At the dedication, Oldenburg told a WKYC-TV producer that it looked as if a giant hand had picked up the sculpture from its intended location at the BP Tower and angrily hurled it several blocks, where it ended up on its side.

His son, Billy Gore, played international rugby for Wales national rugby union team the same as his father. Rugby career Gore played all his rugby union for the unfashionable lower level club Blaina, though during this period the Welsh selectors would often choose tough manual workers to represent the forward positions. Gore first represented Wales in the 1924 Five Nations Championship in a match at the Cardiff Arms Park against Ireland. Under the captaincy of Jack Wetter, Gore found himself on the losing team which stopped a run of 9 successive home wins for Wales. His second game was against France and although a win for Wales, it was a poor Welsh performance caused by players being thrown out of position by the selectors decision to suspend Ossie Male on the trip to Paris. Gore was selected later in the year to face the touring New Zealand team. Wales were totally outclassed by the All Blacks, though the forwards put on a spirited display.Billot (1972), pg 68.

Geography Libouchec is situated in the valley of J√≠lovsk√Ω brook, which separates ƒåesk√© St≈ôedoho≈ô√≠ and the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. History Already in the 10th and 11th century were established two fortresses (in today's J√≠lov√© and in Libouchec). Later, in the 13th century, was established around this royal stronghold new village Libouchec. Its original name was Regis Silva (K√∂nigswald). But the first official mention was in a chronicle in 1169. The first settlers were Celts and Germanics, from the 5th century initially mainly Slavic peoples and from the late Middle Ages onwards mainly Germans. After World War II almost the entire population of the town was expropriated without compensation and expelled due to their German ethnicity. Libouchec was mainly resettled with Czechs, Slovaks and Roma. There was a important Salt trail through Libouchec. Salt was carrying from here to Dƒõƒç√≠n where it was embarked and sent to inland. There started an important production in manufacture in the end of feudalism (buttons, textile, primitive machines). The nobility from Bynov began in the 16th century with logging, mining of ore and silver. In the 19th century was its surroundings industrial region. There began the production of velvet, liqueurs, mustard and agricultural machines. Important was also the railway which has led from Duchcov to Dƒõƒç√≠n. It was built in 1869 by Mr. Zacharias and was the most expensive railway being built at that time. Unfortunately the running of it was canceled in 2008. Sights The most significant buildings in Libouchec are The Church of the Three St. Kings and the castle. The church was built in 1357, but after burning out it was repaired in the 16th century and from that time has been rebuilt many times. The castle (its original name was Sch√∂nstein) was established by G√ºnter from B√ºnau in the 16th century. From that time the castle has weathered much (the Thirty Years' War, fires...) and it has been in the emergency conditions. In 2003 the castle was sold and has since been repaired.

Glauber set a solid foundation for the quantum electronics/quantum optics enterprise. The experimental development of the optical maser and later laser at that time had made the classical concept of optical coherence inadequate. Glauber started from the quantum theory of light detection by considering the process of photoionization in which a photodetector is triggered by an ionizing absorption of a photon. In the quantum theory of radiation, the electric field operator in the Coulomb gauge may be written as the sum of positive and negative frequency parts : E (\\\\mathbf{r}, t) = E^{(+)}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) + E^{(-)}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) where : E^{(-)}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) = E^{(+)}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t)^\\\\dagger One may expand E^{(+)}(\\\\mathbf{r}, t) in terms of the normal modes as follows: : E^{(+)}(\\\\mathbf {r}, t) = i\\\\sum_{j}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega_{j}}{2}\\\\right)^{1/2}\\\\hat{a}_{j}\\\\mathbf{\\\\varepsilon}_{j}e^{i(\\\\mathbf {k}_{j}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf {r} - \\\\omega_{j}t)} where \\\\mathbf {\\\\varepsilon}_{j} are the unit vectors of polarization; this expansion has the same form as the classical expansion except that now the field amplitudes \\\\hat{a}_{j} are operators. Glauber showed that, for an ideal photodetector situated at a point \\\\mathbf {r} in a radiation field, the probability of observing a photoionization event in this detector between time {t} and {\\\\it t} + d{\\\\it t} is proportional to W_{I}(\\\\mathbf {r}, t)d{\\\\it t}, where : {W_{I}(\\\\mathbf {r}, t)} =\\\\langle \\\\psi \\\\mid {E^{(-)}(\\\\mathbf {r}, t)} \\\\cdot {E^{(+)}(\\\\mathbf {r}, t)}\\\\mid \\\\psi \\\\rangle and \\\\psi\\\\rangle specifies the state of the field. Since the radiation field is a quantum-mechanical one, we do not know the exact properties of the incident light, and the probability should be averaged, as in the classical theory, to be proportional to : \\\\langle \\\\hat{a}_{j}^\\\\dagger\\\\hat{a}_{j} \\\\rangle where the angular brackets mean an average over the light field. The significance of the quantum theory of coherence is in the ordering of the creation and destruction operators \\\\hat{a}_{j}^\\\\dagger and \\\\hat{a}_{j}: : [\\\\hat{a}_{j}, \\\\hat{a}_{j}^\\\\dagger] = 1 Since \\\\hat{a}_{j}^\\\\dagger\\\\hat{a}_{j} is not equal to \\\\hat{a}_{j}\\\\hat{a}_{j}^\\\\dagger for a light field, the order makes the quantum statistical measurements (such as photon counting) quite different from the classical ones, i.e., the nonclassical properties of light, such as photon antibunching. Moreover, Glauber's theory of photodetection is of far-reaching fundamental significance to interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Glauber detection theory differs from the Born probabilistic interpretation,M. Born, Z. Phys. 37, 863 (1926). For an English translation, see Quantum Theory and Measurement ed. J. A. Wheeler and W. H. Zurek, Princeton Univ. Press, New Jersey, 1983, pp. 52-55. in that it expresses the meaning of physical law in terms of measured facts (relationships), counting events in the detection processes, without assuming the particle model of matter. These concepts quite naturally lead to a relational approach to quantum physics.

Big wall routes require the climbing team to live on the route often using portaledges and hauling equipment. It is practiced on tall or more vertical faces with few ledges and small cracks. Big wall climbing in Yosemite  History  In the early 20th century, climbers were scaling big rock faces in the Dolomites and the European Alps employing free- and aid- climbing tactics to create bold ascents. Yet, the sheer walls were waiting to be climbed by future generation with better tools and methods. In addition many nations in the early 1900s had specialized army units that had developed wall climbing skills for gaining surprise entry into enemy fortifications by wall climbing. In the early 1900s the 'Filipino Scouts', a US Army unit composed of Filipino enlisted and American officers, demonstrated their specialized skills by climbing the steep walls of a Spanish era fortification in Manila, then bested that demonstration by climbing the same wall again only bringing a battery of mountain howitzers this time to the top of the wall.\\"Soldiers of the Orient Experts in Climbing\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1911, p. 838. Emilio Comici, who was the inventor and proponent of using multi-step aid ladders, solid belays, the use of a trail/tag line, and hanging bivouacs, contributed greatly to the techniques of big wall climbing. Thanks to his innovations, in the late 1950s big wall climbing finally started. In Yosemite, the northwest face of Half Dome was climbed in 1957 and the southeast buttress of El Capitan in 1958. With the invention of hard iron pitons, jumars and hammocks, wall climbing exploded in the 1960s and 1970s. Following those pioneering achievements, parties began routinely setting off prepared for days and days of uninterrupted climbing on very long, hard, steep routes. The food, water, hardware and shelter necessary for such a climb could easily weigh well into the hundreds of pounds. Hauling systems were developed for managing these large loads. In the last few decades, techniques for big wall climbing have evolved, due to greater employment of free-climbing and advances in speed climbing. The routes that used to routinely take days can be climbed in under 24 hours. Nevertheless, many parties still do make multi-day ascents of classic \\"trad routes\\" which have recently gone mostly free and very fast. Only a small handful of elite and exceptionally well-prepared climbers are capable of feats such as free-climbing the entirety of most classic Grade VI routes, or of speed-climbing such routes in a matter of hours.  Hauling  In order to haul portaledges and other gear such as ropes, food, and water up a rock face, the gear is put in a bag (\\"haul bag\\" or \\"pig\\") and pulled up to the next belay station. There are many different mechanically advantageous systems, such as counterweighting, that are utilized to make pulling up the \\"haul bag\\" easier than simply dragging it up the face. Gear is usually spread over many haul bags (usually packed so that they weigh between 30 and 40 kilograms) in order to maximize efficiency and limit loss of equipment if a bag is lost. The hauling system usually consists of a self-locking pulley in order to capture the motion and prevent the bag from descending once hauling stops. Next, an ascender clamped to the haul rope is used to pull the haul line through the pulley.  See also  *El Capitan (film) *Meru (film)  References  External links *5.

He was appointed to the office of constable by the elderly Mayor Josiah Quincy in 1828, and was reappointed every succeeding year to 1874. In 1848, he was promoted to be one of the first detectives in the city.Lane 61 Clapp is most noted for his role in the arrest and prosecution of John White Webster for the murder of George Parkman. Biography Clapp was born in Claremont, New Hampshire, but soon moved to Boston, after his marriage to Susannah Bowditch of Braintree, Massachusetts on February 15, 1818.Vinton 191 He established an auction house, over which he presided for several years before he was appointed to the office of constable for the City of Boston in 1828.Roberts 39; Boston Daily Advertiser, 28:58, 3 In 1832 and 1836, he was also captain of a ward militia company.Roberts 39 According to an interview in the Boston Traveller on October 26, 1874, Clapp stated that \\"136 prisoners arrested by him were sent to the State Prison, and several hundred to the House of Correction, and that many thousand dollars worth of stolen property have been recovered by him and restored to its owners.\\"Clapp 81 He gained renown during his tenure as constable as \\"a successful detecter [sic] of crime\\"Clapp, 82 whose name would conjure \\"dread...among those who had reason to fear an arrest.\\" There were reports that he would instill fear in the guilty without even approaching them.Athens 18 November 1880, page 2 In 1850, most of the dread was harbored by school-aged children, as he was also an appointed truant officer.Lane 62 He and his assistant literally carried hundreds of children from all parts of the city back to the public school system.Clapp 82 In 1849, Clapp caught his \\"big break\\". A prestigious member of the Boston BrahminsStory, 94-121 was reported missing. Clapp's role in the investigation of the disappearance of Dr. George Parkman propelled him into international fame.News reports of the case that appeared in the United Kingdom papers were usually constructed from articles published in the American papers. See The Morning Chronicle (London, England), Wednesday, December 19, 1849; Issue 25012.; The Bristol Mercury (Bristol, England), Saturday, December 22, 1849; Issue 3118; The Ipswich Journal (Ipswich, England), Saturday, December 22, 1849; Issue 5772; Manchester Times (Manchester, England), Saturday, December 22, 1849; Issue 119; The Northern Star and National Trades' Journal (Leeds, England), Saturday, December 22, 1849; Issue 635; Daily News (London, England), Wednesday, April 3, 1850; Issue 1203; Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser (Dublin, Ireland), Thursday, April 4, 1850 His fame was short-lived, however, and in 1854, Boston established its first uniformed police force, with Constable Clapp as its less prominent member.Lane 61; Davis 447 His sole concern was ticketing illegally parked traffic on State Street and serving orders of notice issued by the City Clerk. In January 1874, a muscle tear in his right leg disabled him, but he continued his duties until October of that year. He retired on October 1, 1874 after 46 years of service. Derastus Clapp and the disappearance of Dr. Parkman During 1849-50, Derastus Clapp participated in the investigation of the disappearance of Dr. George Parkman and the subsequent arrest and trial of Professor John White Webster for the murder of Parkman.Clapp, in his brief biography in The Clapp Memorial papers, omitted this particular piece of his history. Clapp's experience before this event was centered on less heinous crimes, such as burglary and counterfeiting,Clapp, 82; Acts & Resolves, 66-7, 308-9 and he was initially unprepared for the demands required when dealing with homicide among the Boston elite.Ferdinand, 84-99. November 23, 1849, was the last day Dr. Parkman was seen.Bemis, 33, 53-4, 262, 269; Stone, 27; Journal, 7; Globe 6; Parkman's family notified Charles M. Kingsley, Parkman's business manager, that the doctor never returned home for lunch. The next day, November 24, he began a search of the city along with a half dozen police officers and a group of concerned citizens. The search continued as the family posted notices offering a reward of $3,000 for information related to Parkman's disappearance. Based on information acquired during the search, on November 26, 1849, Clapp, in addition to Kingsley and other officers, began focusing on the Harvard Medical College and surrounding areas.Bemis 153; Stone 88; Journal 26; Globe 37 During the search of the college, Clapp made his deference to the upper class apparent.Steubenville Herald 1896 According to trial testimony by Mr. Kinsley, Clapp stated to Professor Webster that he was just following orders and no one in the college was a suspect.Bemis 36, 153; Stone 88; Journal 6, 26; Globe 7, 37, Clapp's hesitancy during the search is also on record. While searching Webster's laboratory, he started opening a door to a small room. When Webster told him that he kept his valuable and dangerous articles there, Mr. Clapp put his head as far as the door and turned back again, saying, \\"I will not go in to be blowed up.\\"Bemis 36; Stone 27; Journal 6 As the investigation continued, and suspicion fell on the college as the scene of the crime, Clapp became more aggressive. The college's janitor, Ephraim Littlefield, had been conducting his own investigation, and found what were later to be identified as Dr. Parkman's remains under Webster's private privy. On November 30, a week after Parkman's disappearance, Clapp was again called to the college, where he was the first to view Littlefield's gruesome discovery. He was dispatched to Webster's house to make the arrest.Bemis 155, Stone 88, Journal 26, Globe 37 Clapp was not going to be made the fool twice.Amory 219 Having experience with the \\"rogues\\" of Boston,Lane 57, 65 Clapp called upon his \\"devious Yankee\\"Shimer 430 skills to lure the professor out of his house and into jail. He took a coach and two other officers for back-up and rode to Cambridge to the Webster residence.Bemis 155; Stone 89; Journal 26; Globe 37 Leaving the coach and the other officers parked away from the house, Clapp approached Webster on his porch as he was escorting out a visitor. He requested Webster accompany him to the college to perform another search. Webster went back inside to get his hat and coat, but when he saw the coach and other officers, he suddenly remembered his keys.Amory 219; Dempewolff 252; Clapp deterred his efforts to return to the house and told him they had keys enough to get in, \\"it was of no consequence.\\" Webster boarded silently as Clapp instructed the driver to go over Craigie's Bridge, where the police had been searching the waters earlier. After a few minutes of desultory conversation, Clapp broached the subject of the search efforts for the doctor and the progress the police had made. Webster confessed he had seen Dr. Parkman the week prior at the college, but the doctor had left the campus, still alive. During their conversation, the coach turned on to Brighton Street, and Webster became very agitated. \\"The driver is going the wrong way.\\"Bemis 156; Stone 89; Journal 26; Globe 37 Clapp tried to calm him by telling him the driver was \\"probably green\\" and would get it straightened out. When they stopped in front of the jail, Webster knew something was wrong. \\"What does this all mean?\\"Bemis 155; Stone 89; Journal 26; Globe 38 Clapp escorted him into the jail and charged him with the murder of Dr. George Parkman. Detective Clapp and the other officers continued their efforts while Webster was incarcerated.Bemis 148; Stone 86; Journal 25; Globe 36 On December 5, 1849, Clapp executed a warrant to search the Webster house, meticulously and overtly following proper procedures during the course of the search.Bemis 148; Stone 86; Journal 26; Globe 36 Evidence acquired during the search provided motive for the court to proceed in the prosecution of Professor John White Webster.Bemis 497; Stone 302; Journal 554; Globe 73 Although Derastus Clapp retired from the police force in 1874, he continued to serve in public office and retained his notoriety.Lane 48 In 1896, fifteen years after his death, a small paragraph in an Ohio paper noted: > They have extremely venerable policeman in Boston, Mr. Derastus Clapp. Who > is ninety years old, has been in the department about forty-four years, and > is at present in the special service of the board of street > commissioners.Steubenville Daily Herald 7 Notes References *Acts and Resolves Passed by the General Court *Amory, Cleveland.

The power station, if built, would be located on a 48 ha site midway between Helensville and Kaukapakapa on State Highway 16, near the Kaipara Harbour, north west of Auckland. The proposed development includes substantial upgrade or replacement of the Helensville waste water treatment plant, which the local council would otherwise have to fund. The plant is designed to use high efficiency combined cycle gas turbine technology to meet the increasing demand for electricity in the north Auckland region. The location will also assist to ease constraints on HV electricity transmission. In its assessment of Transpower's proposal to upgrade HV transmission to north of Auckland, the Electricity Commission considered that the Rodney power station project provided a generation alternative to transmission.  Consenting  Genesis Energy's applications for resource consents including air discharges were notified for public submissions in April 2008, a public hearing was held in September and the resource consents were granted by Auckland Regional Council in December 2008. The project was opposed by some local residents, Greenpeace and the Green Party. Land use resource consents for the power station were granted by Rodney District Council in March 2009. A variation to the District Plan created a thermal energy generation rural zone between Helensville and Kaukapakapa. Although resource consents and the District Plan provisions are in place, Genesis does not intend to proceed with construction in the near future. The resource consents allow Genesis a period of 15 years in which to build the plant. The site for the power station is currently for sale, placing the future of this project in doubt.

Life Chad Taylor is a New Zealand author of novels, short stories and screenplays. He was born in Auckland. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Elam. He was the recipient of the Buddle Findlay Sargeson Fellowship for literature in 2001 and the University of Auckland Literary Fellow in 2003. His work has been translated in Germany, Italy and France. In 2006 he was one of 12 New Zealand authors invited to tour France for Les Belles Etrangeres.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid;=10417170 He appeared at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2012. He currently resides in New Zealand. Work Taylor's style can be described as neo-noir. His themes include murder and love, sex, reality, identity and life in an intense, urban environment. The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature (1998) described him as: > A writer of uncompromisingly contemporary fictions of transience and > shifting realities in the modern city. Born and educated in Auckland, where > his work is largely set, he graduated BFA at Elam and has carried that > interest into the strong visual quality of his writing... The fictions often > work on the edge of such conventions as the murder story ('No Sun, No > Rain'), futuristic fantasy ('Somewhere in the 21st Century') or romance > triangle (Pack of Lies, 'Calling Doctor Dollywell'), often through > unreliable or unattractive narrators... As these literary norms are > subverted, perceptions of reality and identity are challenged. Strong visual > representations, especially of sex and clothing, and filmic treatment with > fragmentary and mobile scenes and chronology, provide metaphorical access to > these internal concerns. Guardian Critic Maxim Jakubowski described Taylor's novel Electric (2003) as \\"entropy noir\\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/25/featuresreviews.guardianreview19 and praised Shirker (2000) for its \\"existential anomie.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/25/crimebooks > Much more ambitious, and weaving a seductive web of existential anomie, is > Chad Taylor's Shirker, a fascinating and obsessive novel from New Zealand > with shades of Paul Auster's New York Trilogy. Ellerslie Penrose, a part- > time futures broker, finds a junkie's body in an Auckland dumpster, steals > his wallet and embarks on a hallucinatory journey into the shadow life of > the dead man. This brings him into contact with fantasy bordellos, > mysterious manuscripts, bizarre antiques dealers, and a sleazy nest of > quirky happenstance. Oddly detached from its subject matter, this is as > hypnotic as they come; it's also miles away from the conventions of your > average country-cottage crime or pig-headed cop yarn. One for the > connoisseurs. Taylor acknowledged the \\"noir\\" label in a 2009 interview:http://primastoria.com/feature/conversation-with-chad-taylor > I‚Äôve basically deconstructed crime novels: I‚Äôve taken aspects of crime > novels, rewritten them, taken them apart.

Time Out London selected the novel as Book of the Week on 22 January 2003. Time Out critic Roger Howard described Electric as a story of chaos and urban malaise: > His setting is a New Zealand you won't see in Lord of the Rings: a city > suffering from the same urban malaise as glitzier metropolises on other > continents. Our protagonist, Samuel Usher, is a drug addict who supports > himself by recovering data from damaged computers. He falls in with a couple > of drifters who occupy themselves with recondite mathematics. But the > favoured activity for all three involves powders on polished surfaces. When > Jules dies in mysterious circumstances, Usher sets off to find out why. > Thematically, Taylor's concerns are twofold: the infinite extent of > digitised culture; and the limitless flood of narcotics (not to mention the > global industry behind it). Electric looks at what happens when chaos rises > up to warp these apparently unassailable > worlds.http://chadtaylor.mobi/electric.html The novel Departure Lounge (2006) is based on the 1979 Erebus crash. Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley compared the novel's style to Raymond Chandler: > His style owes a lot to Raymond Chandler and lesser apostles of noir, but at > the same time it's very much his own.

Todd against a Spanish fleet led by Joaqu√≠n G√≥mez de Barreda, which occurred during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The significantly more powerful United States Navy squadron, consisting of four gunboats, two armed tugs and a patrol yacht, overpowered a Royal Spanish Navy squadron which consisted of four gunboats, three pontoon used as floating batteries and three transports, sinking or destroying all the Spanish ships present without losing a single ship of their own. The victory came on the heels of a more significant American success at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, and was the third largest naval engagement of the war after Santiago de Cuba and the Battle of Manila Bay. Tensions between Spain and the United States worsened over Spanish behavior during their efforts to quell a revolution in their colony of Cuba, with the American public being agitated by largely falsified reports of Spanish atrocities against the Cuban population. In January 1898, in the interest of safeguarding American interests in Cuba, the cruiser USS Maine was dispatched to the island. In February 1898, the Maine exploded while lying at anchor in Havana harbor, killing more than half her crew and inflaming American opinion against Spain, with the Spanish being portrayed as the culprit in the American media regardless of the actual source of the explosion. Two months later, war was declared.Knight, pg. 709 After defeating the largest Spanish squadron stationed in Cuba, the United States Navy continued dispatching warships to defeat the remaining Spanish naval presence on the island, as they had done upon the outbreak of war. The port of Manzanillo contained a significant Spanish naval presence in addition to being a haven for Spanish blockade runners, and the Americans had attempted twice before to destroy the squadron lying at anchor, with both the first and second attempts having being repulsed. On the third attempt, all U.S. naval elements in the area, reinforced by two Wilmington-class gunboats combined forces under the command of Chapman C. Todd to destroy the Spanish vessels once and for all. The seven- ship force split into three different groups and entered the harbor at the same time to ensure the Spanish vessels had no path of escape. They first targeted the three transports and destroyed them while they were lying at anchor, alongside repulsing several gunboats who moved to repulse the Americans. The seven ships then moved further in the harbor to engage the gunboats and the immobile pontoon. All gunboats and transports were quickly destroyed or sunk, with minimal casualties for the Americans, with the only casualty being damage incurred to the lone armed tug.Keenan, pg. 238Everett, pg. 143 Although the battle destroyed the small Spanish squadron in the harbor, the Spanish defenders inside the town refused to relinquish control of the city to the Americans, leading to the Fourth Battle of Manzanillo, resulting in the town falling into American hands.  Background  A Spanish gunboat during the Spanish-American War, similar to the kind utilised at Manzanillo. Upon the outbreak of war, the United States Navy had placed a blockade around the island of Cuba, both to assist the local revolutionaries fighting against Spanish rule, and to hamper Spanish efforts to resist the American expeditionary forces by ensuring they could not move around men and supplies to areas which required them. Several ports in Cuba, such as C√°rdenas and Cienfuegos had already seen several unsuccessful attempts by the Americans to attack the ports, with the Battle of C√°rdenas proving to be the most costly American failure. Spanish blockade runners would move from port to port to skirt the American blockade, bringing vital men and material to Spanish soldiers engaged in combat with the Cubans. The port of Manzanillo had been a refuge for Spanish troop transports and blockade runners (many of which were requisitioned merchant steamships) since the outbreak of war, and the United States Navy had already dispatched two reconnaissance expeditions to the harbor to determine its defenses.Naval Operations Manzanillo, Naval History and Heritage CommandTucker, pg. 377 The first expedition, consisting of the gunboats and , alongside the armed tug under the command of Lucien Young, attempted to clear the harbor of the Spanish vessels. Accurate fire from the four Spanish gunboats in the harbor, Estrella, Guant√°namo, Centinela and the Delgado Parejo forced an American withdrawal, with only three casualties and damaged vessels to show for their efforts.Tucker, pg. 377Villafa√±a, 2012 The second expedition, led by Adolph Marix and consisting of the and , launched their attack unaware of the fate of the first expedition, and were similarly repulsed by the Parrott guns of the Spanish gunboats.Naval Operations Manzanillo, Naval History and Heritage CommandVillafa√±a, 2012\\"Marix at Manzanillo\\", New York Times Wrote one American sailor:\\"Marix at Manzanillo\\", New York Times Although a number of awards were given for these actions, they proved that the presence of the Spanish vessels and shore batteries were not going to be easy to overcome, and two gunboats were accordingly dispatched to aid the American vessels, the two being the and . The commanding officer of the Wilmington, Chapman C. Todd, became commander of the now seven-vessel strong American force, and moved to clear the harbor of Spanish vessels.McKinley, pg. 261 Todd ordered his vessels to be split up into three groups, with the two gunboats Wilmington and Helena being ordered to enter the harbor via a channel on the northern side of the bay and attacking from the left, Osceola and Scorpion being ordered to attack from a channel directly opposite the city, and the Wompatuck, Hist and Hornet being ordered to move in from the right through one of the bays southern channels. All three of the American squadrons were instructed to time their passages through the channels to enter the bay concurrently. The reason behind the division of the squadron was to prevent any Spanish vessels from escaping by blocking their escape routes.\\"How Todd Sunk Seven Ships\\", New York TimesNaval Operations Manzanillo, Naval History and Heritage Command  Battle  USS Wilmington on the Orinoco River in Venezuela. At 07:00am, the seven American warships began to approach the harbor of Manzanillo, having rendezvoused at Guayabal the night before.McKinley, pg. 261\\"How Todd Sunk Seven Ships\\", New York Times Just four minutes later the battle began when Spanish shore batteries noticed the approaching Americans and began firing at them, although they scored no hits. Some fifteen minutes later, the Scorpion and Osceola replied by opening fire on the shore batteries, although they likewise were unable to score any hits. At 07:50am, the Americans sighted the three Spanish transports lying at anchor, these being the El Gloria, Jose Garcia and El Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n.McKinley, pg. 262\\"How Todd Sunk Seven Ships\\", New York Times El Gloria and Jose Garcia were merchant steamers used for transporting troops while the El Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n was a blockade runner. All three vessels were destroyed over a two and a half hour period by the Americans, who were careful to remain out of the range of the Spanish batteries.Tucker, pg. 377Villafa√±a, 2012\\"How Todd Sunk Seven Ships\\", New York TimesNaval Operations Manzanillo, Naval History and Heritage CommandMcKinley, pg. 262 Upon seeing the plight of their fellow vessels, several Spanish gunboats set sail and moved to repulse the American warships, however they found themselves being repulsed and forced to retreat further inside the harbor due to being outgunned. Hist, Hornet, and Wompatuck pursued the gunboats to their moorings and engaged them. The American vessels continued their advance into the harbor, but they soon ran into issues with the shallow depth of Manzanillo's bay, forcing them to reconnoiter passages so that the deeper-drafted gunboats, the Wilmington and the Helena, would not beach themselves accidentally.Dyal, pg. 206 Advancing upon the Spanish positions, Todd realised that his forces were focusing too much of their fire upon transports taking refuge in the harbor alongside the immobile pontoon present, the hulk and storeship Maria, and ordered the Helena to switch to targeting the cornered gunboats instead of assisting the Willmington with finishing the transports and pontoon off.Naval Operations Manzanillo, Naval History and Heritage Command With the transports and pontoons destroyed, all the American efforts were switched to finishing off the badly damaged gunboats. One by one, the four gunboats were finished off, with three being destroyed, one being sunk and another beaching itself before sinking later.Dyal, pg. 206 At 10:22am, just three hours after initiating the engagement, Todd gave the order to withdraw from the harbor. On their way out, much as they had done on their way in, they made sure to keep out of the range of the Spanish batteries, who had helplessly watched the battle unfold.Tucker, pg. 377Naval Operations Manzanillo, Naval History and Heritage Command\\"How Todd Sunk Seven Ships\\", New York Times During the battle, Todd had noted the good performance of the officers serving under him, and stated as such in his battle report to Sampson:\\"How Todd Sunk Seven Ships\\", New York Times  Aftermath  The USS Wompatuck underway, 20 April 1899. By 10:35am, the battle had been concluded. The Spanish squadron had been entirely destroyed, suffering casualties of three men killed, fourteen men wounded, four gunboats sunk or destroyed and three transports and pontoons burned to the waterline, while the Americans, on the other hand, had suffered no casualties. The only significant damage incurred by the American force was a three-pounder gun that broke loose from its rivets on the Wompatuck, though one of USS Wilmingtons guns was disabled due to Spanish gunfire for a few minutes.McKinley, pg. 262 The threat posed by the Spanish flotilla was eliminated, and the American squadron returned victorious to the main fleet. The Wompatuck, however, left the rest of the warships and instead sailed towards at Guant√°namo Bay where the Americans had established a base after their victory at the Battle of Guant√°namo Bay to bring Admiral William T. Sampson news of the latest American victory.Naval Operations Manzanillo, Naval History and Heritage Command During the battle, the Americans took great care to ensure that their gunfire did not target the city, and in the words of Todd, \\"so far as could be observed, little, if any, was done.\\"\\"How Todd Sunk Seven Ships\\", New York Times Although the Spanish naval presence in Manzanillo was eliminated, the Spanish defenders in the town stubbornly refused to relinquish control to either the Americans or the Cubans, and even without a naval presence, it took a U.S. Navy bombardment of the town combined with Cuban rebels storming the town for the Spanish to finally surrender the town, when they learnt of the ceasefire that resulted in the end of the war.Tucker, pg. 377 Manzanillo would be the last town to surrender in Cuba during the war and the last engagement which took place on the island.Villafa√±a, 2012Naval Operations Manzanillo, Naval History and Heritage Command Four days after the battle, on the 22nd of July, the New York Times published news of the victory to the American public.\\"How Todd Sunk Seven Ships\\", New York Times  References   Bibliography     * Category:Naval battles of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Category:Battles involving Cuba Battle of Manzanillo 03 Battle of Manzanillo 03 Category:Conflicts in 1898 Battle of Manzanillo 03 ","title":"Third Battle of Manzanillo"},{"id":"20004303","text":"The Teche Greyhound Lines (called also Teche or TGL), a highway-coach carrier, was a Greyhound regional operating company, based in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, from 1934 until 1954, when it (along with the Dixie Greyhound Lines) was merged into the Southeastern Greyhound Lines, a neighboring operating company. [Teche, pronounced as \\"tesh\\", is a word of French origin, a word (t√©che) for \\"snake\\" - due to a legend (about a large snake in the region) which the natives had told to the early French traders and explorers - from the name of the Bayou Teche in the swamp country in coastal Louisiana.] Correction note: Not named Teche because of a big snake in the region; but, because the Bayou Teche has a snakelike appearance as it meanders through the land curving this way and then that way, similar to snakelike movements.  Origin  The Teche Greyhound Lines (GL) began as the Teche Transfer Company, which became incorporated in Louisiana in April 1920 to operate buses between Jeanerette and New Iberia (a distance of about 10 miles in the region west of New Orleans and Baton Rouge and southeast of Lafayette). The firm then began to grow in steps. In 1929 the Teche Transfer Company became renamed as the Teche Lines, then in 1932 it began to use the hyphenated brand name, trade name, or service name of the Teche-Greyhound Lines (with the consent of The Greyhound Corporation, the parent Greyhound firm), while at first retaining its own corporate name (until 1934) - after it entered into a through-traffic agreement with Greyhound, and after Greyhound began to buy a minority interest in Teche (which interest continued to grow).  Wheeling and dealing  In 1929 the Old South Coach Lines came into existence - to buy (from the Alabama Bus Company) a short branch line (with a length of about 59 miles), between Birmingham and Tuscaloosa (both in Alabama), then promptly extended about 93 more miles (by application rather than purchase) from Tuscaloosa to Meridian (in Mississippi). The next year, 1930, the Teche Lines bought the Old South Coach Lines, thereby completing its route between New Orleans and Birmingham. [That same year, 1930, the Alabama Bus Company - which in 1929 had sold its branch line from Birmingham to Tuscaloosa (to the Old South Coach Lines) - became bought by and merged into the Consolidated Coach Corporation (which in 1936 became renamed as the Southeastern Greyhound Lines) - thereby extending Consolidated from Chattanooga (in Tennessee) through Birmingham and Montgomery to Mobile (all three in Alabama) - the entire length of the \\"Heart of Dixie\\".] The Old South Lines (entirely different from the Old South Coach Lines) was a property of John Gilmer, who previously (in 1925) had founded the Camel City Coach Company, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which (in 1929) became the southern half of the National Highway Transport (NHT) Company, based in Charleston, West Virginia, which (in 1931) became renamed as the Atlantic Greyhound Lines. In 1933 the Old South Lines started running between Charlotte (in North Carolina) and Atlanta (in Georgia) and between Columbia (in South Carolina) and Atlanta. Gilmer‚Äôs Old South Lines in 1934 bought the route between Montgomery and Atlanta (including an alternate loop through Columbus in Georgia) ‚Äì from the Hood Coach Lines, which on that route had begun its first service (in 1930 between Atlanta and Columbus, then in 1933 onward to Montgomery), and which had soon tried (unsuccessfully) to run additional routes between Atlanta and Macon (in Georgia), between Macon and Savannah (in Georgia), and between Macon and Jacksonville (in Florida) via Waycross (in Georgia). [Hood in November 1934 sold also the latter routes - to the Consolidated Coach Corporation and the Union Bus Company (acting jointly), with the Atlanta-Macon and Macon-Waycross-Jacksonville routes going to Consolidated (which in 1936 became renamed as the Southeastern Greyhound Lines) and with the Macon-Savannah route going to Union (which in 1941 was bought by and merged into the Southeastern GL) - thereby gaining for Consolidated and Union (and therefore later for Greyhound) not only a new route between Macon and Savannah and a parallel alternate route between Atlanta and Macon but also a quicker alternate route between Macon and Jacksonville (about 50 miles shorter than its older route via Valdosta in Georgia and Lake City in Florida). After that last sale the Hood firm, no longer holding any other route, went out of business. In 1935 the Atlantic GL bought the Old South routes to Atlanta from Charlotte and from Columbia, thereby preparing to establish connections in Atlanta with the Teche GL and the Southeastern GL. In February 1936 Teche bought the Old South route between Montgomery and Atlanta (with the loop through Columbus), thereby completing its route between New Orleans and Atlanta.  Background and participation of O.W. Townsend  O.W. Townsend, who in 1932 obtained control of the Teche Lines, had begun in the highway-coach industry in 1924 when he founded the Cornhusker Stage Lines (based in Hastings, Nebraska, running between Hastings and Lincoln, the capital of the Cornhusker State), which in 1927 became a link in the chain of independently owned carriers which (acting separately but cooperatively) operated under the collective name of the YellowaY Lines (in an attempt to reach from coast to coast). Soon under the YellowaY name Townsend ran his coaches across Nebraska between Chicago (in Illinois) and Denver (in Colorado) - and maybe onward to Salt Lake City (in Utah). In 1928 Townsend sold some (but not all) of his rights (in the routes of the Cornhusker Stage Lines) to the newly formed American Motor Transportation Company, which bought also most of the other independent YellowaY member firms, and which then operated them as the YellowaY-Pioneer System. [On 11 September 1928 a YellowaY-Pioneer coach completed the first regularly scheduled coast-to-coast bus trip in the US (from Los Angeles to New York City) by a single operating company.] In 1929 the Motor Transit Corporation (called also MTC) bought the Yelloway-Pioneer System, and later in 1929 the MTC became renamed as The Greyhound Corporation. Townsend in 1929 sold his remaining property (including the remaining routes) in the Cornhusker Stage Lines to the Union Pacific (UP) Railroad, which merged it into its new Interstate Transit Lines, which in 1943 (along with the Union Pacific, UP, Stages, another bus subsidiary of the UP Railroad) began operating under the brand name, trade name, or service name of the Overland Greyhound Lines (after The Greyhound Corporation began to buy a minority interest in each of those two bus companies of the railroad), and both of which in 1952 became wholly owned subsidiaries of the parent Greyhound firm, then became merged, under the name of the Overland Greyhound Lines, as a division of The Greyhound Corporation. Meanwhile, even before Townsend sold the remainder of Cornhusker to Interstate (that is, not later than 1929), he began another carrier ‚Äì the Atlantic-Pacific Stages, running between Saint Louis (in Missouri) and Los Angeles (in California) via Kansas City (on the state line between Kansas and Missouri), Denver (in Colorado), and Albuquerque (in New Mexico) - which in 1930 he sold to the Interstate Transit, Inc., a completely different firm (different from the Interstate Transit Lines) with a confusingly similar name, operating as the Colonial Stages, which afterward became renamed as the Colonial Atlantic-Pacific Stages (called also CAPS), and which succumbed in 1932 during (and as a casualty of) the Great Depression. In 1931 and 1932 Townsend lived and worked in Philadelphia (in Pennsylvania) as the regional manager of the eastern end of the CAPS. After the second (and final) failure of the CAPS, Townsend moved to New Orleans (lawfully taking with him about 20 of the newer coaches, Macks of the model BK), bought a controlling interest in the Teche Lines, and began making deals with The Greyhound Corporation.  Further developments  About 1934 Greyhound increased its partial ownership of the Teche Lines to a controlling (majority) interest, and Greyhound renamed Teche as the unhyphenated Teche Greyhound Lines; then in 1939 Greyhound bought also the last remaining minority interest of Townsend (first leaving the new Teche GL as a wholly owned subsidiary); and in 1941 Greyhound merged the TGL into itself as a division of the parent Greyhound firm. By 1954 the TGL ran from New Orleans to Baton Rouge (in Louisiana), Natchez (in Mississippi), through Hammond (in Louisiana) to Jackson (in Mississippi and on the way to Memphis, Saint Louis, and Chicago), through Hattiesburg and Meridian (both in Mississippi) to Birmingham (in Alabama), through Mobile and Montgomery (both in Alabama) and Columbus (in Georgia) to Atlanta (in Georgia), through Mobile to Marianna (in Florida and on the way to Tallahassee and the rest of the Sunshine State), and westward through Lafayette to Lake Charles (both in Louisiana and on the way to Houston, the rest of Texas, and the rest of the West), plus along several regional and feeder routes in the southern part of the Pelican State. The Teche GL met the Dixie GL to the north, the Southwestern GL to the west, and the Atlantic GL and the Southeastern GL to the east. The TGL took part in major interlined through-routes (using pooled equipment in cooperation with other Greyhound companies) - that is, the use of through-coaches on through- routes running through the territories of two or more Greyhound regional operating companies - connecting New Orleans with Los Angeles, Houston, Memphis, Saint Louis, Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Washington, Jacksonville, Miami, and Saint Petersburg.  Merger into Southeastern GL  In October 1954 The Greyhound Corporation merged Teche and a neighboring operating company, the Dixie GL (called also Dixie or DGL), based in Memphis, Tennessee, into the Southeastern GL (called also Southeastern, SEG, SEGL, or the SEG Lines), another neighboring regional company, based in Lexington, Kentucky. The three fleets of the three divisions became combined into a single fleet. Thus ended the Teche GL.  Beyond Teche GL  After that merger the newly expanded Southeastern GL served 12 states along 13,227 route-miles of highways - from Cincinnati (in Ohio), Saint Louis, Memphis, Natchez, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and Lake Charles - to Savannah and Jacksonville - from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Ohio River to the Gulf of Mexico. In October 1957 The Greyhound Corporation merged also the Florida GL (called also FGL), one more neighboring operating company, based in Jacksonville, Florida, into the SEGL. In November 1960 The Greyhound Corporation further merged the Atlantic GL (called also Atlantic or AGL), yet another neighboring regional company, based in Charleston, West Virginia, with - not into but rather with - the Southeastern GL, thereby creating the Southern Division of The Greyhound Corporation (called also the Southern GL), the third of four huge new divisions (along with Central, Eastern, and Western). Thus ended the Southeastern GL, and thus began the Southern GL. Later (about 1966) The Greyhound Corporation reorganized again, into just two humongous divisions, named as the Greyhound Lines East (GLE) and the Greyhound Lines West (GLW); even later (about 1970) it eliminated those two divisions, thus leaving a single gargantuan undivided nationwide fleet. When the Southern GL came into existence, the headquarters functions became gradually transferred from Lexington, Kentucky, and Charleston, West Virginia, to Atlanta, Georgia; when GLE arose, many of those administrative functions became shifted from Atlanta to Cleveland, Ohio; eventually those functions migrated to Chicago, Illinois, then to Phoenix, Arizona, when (in 1971) The Greyhound Corporation moved its corporate headquarters from Chicago to a new building in Phoenix. In 1987 The Greyhound Corporation (the original umbrella Greyhound firm), which had become widely diversified far beyond passenger transportation, sold its entire highway-coach operating business (its core bus business) to a new company, named as the Greyhound Lines, Inc., called also GLI, based in Dallas, Texas - a separate, independent, unrelated firm, which was the property of a group of private investors under the promotion of Fred Currey, a former executive of the Continental Trailways (later renamed as the Trailways, Inc., called also TWI, also based in Dallas), which was the largest member company in the Trailways trade association (then named as the National Trailways Bus System, now as the Trailways Transportation System). Later in 1987 the Greyhound Lines, Inc., the GLI, the new firm based in Dallas, further bought also the Trailways, Inc., the TWI, its largest competitor, and merged it into the GLI. The lenders and the other investors of the GLI ousted Fred Currey (as the chief executive officer) after the firm went into bankruptcy in 1990. The GLI has continued to experience difficulties and lackluster performance under a succession of new owners and new executives - while continuing to reduce its level of service - by hauling fewer passengers aboard fewer coaches on fewer trips along fewer routes with fewer stops in fewer communities in fewer states - and by doing so on fewer days - that is, increasingly operating some trips less often than every day (fewer than seven days per week) - and by using fewer through-coaches, thus requiring passengers to make more transfers (from one coach to another). After the sale to the GLI, The Greyhound Corporation changed its name to the Greyhound-Dial Corporation, then the Dial Corporation, then the Viad Corporation. [The contrived name Viad appears to be a curious respelling of the former name Dial - if one scrambles the letters D, I, and A, then turns the V upside down and regards it as the Greek letter lambda - Œõ - that is, the Greek equivalent of the Roman or Latin letter L.] The website of the Viad Corporation (http://www.viad.com) in September 2008 makes no mention of its corporate history or its past relationship to Greyhound - that is, its origin as The Greyhound Corporation.

Traditionally colored with an orange base and topped with a green stem to make candy pumpkins largely identifiable with Halloween, a candy pumpkin is considered a mellow creme by confectioners since the candy has a marshmallow flavor. Sometimes called candy corn's first cousin, candy pumpkins are made through a starch casting process similar to that for candy corn. Brach's candy pumpkin, known by the trademarked name \\",\\" is the most popular candy pumpkin. Brach's Confections is now owned by Farley's & Sathers Candy Company. History Candy pumpkins are made using a similar process to make candy corn. The candy corn process and product were created by George Renninger of the Wunderlee Candy Co. in the 1880s and became popular as a treat in the 1920s. Candy pumpkins first were produced in mid 20th century using a process similar to that of candy corn. Corn syrup, food coloring, honey, and sugar are beaten and heated in large kettles to produce an ultra-sweet syrup. This syrupy mix generically is called \\"mellowcreme\\" by confectioners, since the resulting candy has a mellow, creamy texture. The mellowcreme slurry then was divided into two uneven amounts, with the large amount receiving orange food coloring and the smaller receiving green food coloring. A mogul machine brings the two colored mixtures together into a mold made of cornstarch, and the assembly is sent to a separate drying room to dry for 24 to 36 hours. Once dry, the candy is shaken violently to remove excess cornstarch and a final glaze is added to give the candy pumpkin a sheen. Candy pumpkins, acorns and other shapes that are derived from the mellowcreme mixture are often sold with candy corn under the name \\"harvest mix.\\" Impact Candy pumpkins are popular in part because the mellowcreme gives them \\"an interesting texture.\\" As of 1988, most big confectionery companies, including Mars Inc., did not market special Halloween candies. The one exception was Brach's Confections, which made candy pumpkins among other seasonal products. Their \\"Mellowcreme Pumpkin\\" was made to look like an autumnal fruit; each pumpkin contained 25 calories and 5 grams sugar. In 1992, Brach's Confections expected to sell more than 30 million pounds of mellowcreme candy during the fall season, which included its seasonal mellowcreme pumpkins. You can also find the candy pumpkin in Brach's Autumn Mix. By the late 1990s, competitors of Brach's realized that the market for the special Halloween candy pumpkin was expanding. For example, in 1997, candy pumpkins and other mellowcreme candies helped push annual spending on Halloween candy in the United States to an estimated $950 million a year. In response, Mars, Inc. came out with Snickers Creme Pumpkin in 1998. The milk chocolate-covered peanut and caramel candy was packaged in a 1.20 oz. size with a plastic wrapper featuring a jack-o-lantern on the package. At the time, the Snickers Creme Pumpkin retailed for 50 U.S. cents. Two years later, in 2000, Frankford Candy & Chocolate Company cross-licensed with ConAgra Foods to produce Peter Pan Peanut Butter Pumpkins. Peter Pan Peanut Butter Pumpkins included a \\"rich and creamy\\" Peter Pan peanut butter center pressed into a detailed pumpkin mold. At that time, the Peter Pan pumpkin candy was sold in 14 oz. bags. Also in 2000, Zachary Confections expanded its product line to include candy pumpkins. In addition to helping characterize Halloween, candy pumpkins played a role in the current U.S. implementation of daylight saving time. Since the 1960s, candy makers had wanted to get the trick-or-treat period covered by Daylight Saving, reasoning that if children have an extra hour of daylight, they would collect more candy. During the 1985 U.S Congressional hearings on Daylight Saving, the industry went so far as to put candy pumpkins on the seat of every senator, hoping to win a little favor. On July 8, 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1986 into law; it contained a daylight saving rider which continued daylight saving time until the early morning of last Sunday in October; this did not include Halloween night. In 2005, daylight saving time was extended to the first Sunday in November‚Äîjust long enough to include Halloween.
