Dunn (November 27, 1840 – November 27, 1914) was an American politician from New York.  Life  Dunn was born in Chenango, New York on November 27, 1840. He was the son of John Dunn and Isabella Black. He attended Susquehanna Seminary and a business college, and was about to begin business life when the American Civil War broke out. In May 1861, Dunn enlisted in the 27th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment and was mustered in as sergeant of Company C. He was captured by the Confederacy in the First Battle of Bull Run. He was paroled in May 1862. In August, he reenlisted in the 109th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment and was mustered in as captain of Company D. He was wounded in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House in May 1864. After the battle, he was promoted to major.

Qasr Al-Qatraneh (alternatively: \\"Qatraneh\\" or \\"Qatrana Castle,\\" \\"Fortress Qatrana,\\" or \\"Khan Qatraneh\\") is an Ottoman structure which largely served to provide water and protection on the Syrian pilgrimage route between the Levant and the Gulf. It is located in modern-day Jordan, just off of the country's Desert Highway, approximately 90 kilometers south of Amman and northwest of the town of Qatraneh. It is one of at least ten khans that have been identified and documented along the Syrian pilgrimage route in Jordan.  History  The fort/castle is a three-story structure of basalt and limestone, notably with a large water reservoir (70m by 70m) that collects water thanks to proximity to nearby wadi (valleys). There are three phases at the site, including restoration work done by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities in the 1970s, the addition of machicolations boxes (projecting windows) in the 18th century, and the original building, including the first row of the arrow slits and crenellations. A photograph from the 19th century indicates that at least one of the second-story roofs may have been a hemispherical dome, suggesting possible use of the structure as a mosque. The building is typically credited to the reign of Sultan Sulayman I in the year 1560. The Sultan provided funds to clean the pool. However, the testimony of medieval historical sources indicates previous existence, followed by re-building under the Ottomans; the earliest reference is from Ibn Habib Al-Halabi in the 14th century. As noted by archaeologist Reem Samed Al Shqour, ancient khans and their courtyard fortifications were obvious models upon which later peoples could build (literally and metaphorically). Shqour writes: \\"The basic layout known as the courtyard fortification pattern can be traced back as early as the Late Bronze and Iron Age structures in Jordan...Undoubtedly, the durability and survivability of these structures meant that succeeding polities were well aware of the existence and advantages...if not in possessing, rebuilding, and utilizing the older, original structures, then in using them as models for new building designed along the same of similar plan.\\" One of the primary functions of the fort would have been as defense, and this would have been the function of similar, more ancient structures. However, Shqour notes that Islamic presence in the region left a \\"unique Islamic stamp on the form of the qusur [castles]\\" and there are records of multiple functions for Castle Qatrana and its like—they served as dwelling places, trade centers, storehouses for pilgrims, and, perhaps uniquely in the case of Qatrana, as a rudimentary postal office in the 19th century.  Differing Dates of Construction  The largest group of historians believe that the castle dates back to the Ottoman Era. The Jordanian Department of Antiquities followed suit, cooperating with the Turkish government to do the necessary restoration. The former maintains that the building is from the Mamluk era, and referred to as Khan Qatraneh. Historical texts confirm that it was a hostel in 926 AH / 1520 BCE, when a Shami caravan returned from the Hajj, and pilgrims stayed in the al-Hasa region.  Water System in the Castle  The residents that lived in the region during the Byzantine and Roman periods developed a system to bring water from vast, extensive terrain to the cities, towns, and villages and their buildings. The system is what we would now call a watershed. And the studies performed by the Department of Antiquities in the al-Qatraneh region reveal that they made channels to make water flow from the region of Wadi al- Hasa to the other nearby wadis and the nearby lake. The urgent need for the daily use of water and other uses has been the driver of the creation and design of these prominent water systems. So the water system in Qasr al- Qatraneh consists of two channels, a sediment basin, and a large pool to gather and harvest water, and a well located inside the castle. A rock channel was discovered, which was used to transfer water to the pond. What remains of these foundational stones that were discovered on the site near the valley accurately and precisely demonstrates the significant degree of mastery in construction and design in the system. In addition to the castle, there is a water facility that provided the residents with clean water for drinking, irrigation, and livestock. The main pond is at a distance of 26 meters from the castle, with dimensions of 70 X 70 meters, and a depth of 5.2 meters. The dam is 75 meters from the castle, and is 38 meters high and 6.6 meters wide and 2.4 meters deep. The two connecting channels are each 105cm in diameter, and 90cm from each other. South of the castle is Wadi Hanifa, which stretches from the southeast to the west, and Wadi Hafira, which converges with Wadi Hanifa. Both were the reason for the water harvesting system.  Design of the Castle  The castle is a rectangular building whose area is approximately 17 × 22 square meters. Its dimensions are 22.2 meters long, and 17.35 wide. Its height is approximately 10 to 10.5 meters. The walls of the castle were built of polished stones, and the palace from clay and limestone tiles, as was the custom in Jordan during the Mamluk period. The castle door was on the eastern facing facade, whose gate was about 3 meters tall, and has dimensions of 185 cm × 140 cm and a thickness of 35 cm. The door opens in a semi-circle, and is decorated. There is a prominent balcony atop the gate, overlooking the road from the castle. This mashrabiya is used to surveil prisoners and to fortify the entrance, which leads to a small lobby, and opposing vaults that lead to a courtyard. On both floors are corridors with semi-cylindrical and opposing vaults, and a stairway to the upper floor. The prisoners draw water from the well in the center of the castle, and to the east of the castle, two adjacent ponds collect rainwater, for travelers and pilgrims to drink.  Massacre  Sources show that the castle was attacked and everybody in it was killed, in the Hajj season, 1139 AH / 1726 BCE. The castle's fame explains that it was vulnerable to raids, looting, and pillaging, especially in the hajj season of 1699.

The story revolves around the eponymous scholar who, despite being intellectually gifted, struggles to pass the provincial examination until assisted by an immortal who befriends Jia while disguised as a fellow scholar. He unsuccessfully pursues an ascetic lifestyle, and returns to civilisation to discover that a century has elapsed, before becoming a bureaucrat. The story was first partly translated into English by British sinologist Herbert Giles, who described Jia as a \\"Chinese Rip Van Winkle\\". Plot Jia Fengzhi () is a brilliant scholar who constantly fails the provincial examination only because his essays are too profound for the examiners. One day, he encounters a xiucai named Lang (), whose erudite manner impresses Jia. The two men strike up a friendship, and Lang advises Jia to lower his literary standards in order to pass the examination; Jia refuses to do so and continues to languish. Three years later, Lang returns and poses to Jia a few topics to write essays on. However, he roundly criticises all of Jia's essays, prompting Jia to compose new ones using clichés and awkward phrases from his old writings. To his surprise, Lang tells him to memorise them and inscribes a fu on his back. During the actual examination, Jia regurgitates the substandard writing and becomes the top scorer. Disillusioned by the experience, Jia professes to become an ascetic, whereupon Lang takes him to his shifu, an elderly cave dwelling sage. Jia entreaties the master to accept him as his disciple, and is instructed to cultivate himself in the cave. Following a brief encounter with a wild tiger, Jia is visited by an apparition of his wife, with whom he proceeds to make love. She disappears once the master returns; already aware of what has transpired, the master forces Lang to escort Jia out of the cave. Jia returns home but finds his neighbourhood virtually unrecognisable—reminiscent of the legend of Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao. Unaware of his identity, a village elder informs Jia that Jia Fengzhi had disappeared after becoming a juren, leaving behind his wife and their adolescent son; about a hundred years ago, when their son became a teenager, Jia's wife fell into a deep sleep and—following the death of their son—had been taken care of by her two impoverished grandchildren. A month ago, however, she had suddenly awoken from her century-long slumber. Upon hearing this, Jia reveals his identity. While his quinquagenarian grandchild, Jia Xiang () is initially sceptical of the claim, his grandmother herself positively identifies her husband. Jia's eldest granddaughter-in-law, Wu (), whose husband died a while ago, is filial to both Jia and his wife; in contrast, Jia Xiang and his family regard them with contempt. Angered by their offhandedness, Jia relocates to the countryside with his wife and settles down as a teacher. Some time later, Jia earns his jinshi degree, a few years after which he becomes appointed as a bureaucrat in Zhejiang. However, because he is impervious to bribery, many of his fellow court officials wish to sabotage him, and the Emperor repeatedly denies Jia's requests to return home. Meanwhile, Jia Xiang and his six sons misuse Jia Fengzhi's name to extort villagers of their land and money. One of Jia Xiang's sons kidnaps the bride of a Mou Yi () and Jia Fengzhi is implicated. Jia Fengzhi and Jia Xiang and his sons are captured and incarcerated; after a year, while still imprisoned, they all die of illness save Jia Fengzhi. Jia is released and sent to Luoyang; Jia's wife reunites with him after entrusting her xiucai great-grandson Jia Gao ()—one of her granddaughter-in-law Wu's two children—with the care of her seventeen-year-old son (i.e. Jia Gao's granduncle) whom she had conceived after relocating to the countryside with Jia Fengzhi. Now with his wife in Luoyang, Jia laments the misfortune in his life. One day, while Jia is walking by the beach with his wife and their servants, a boatman beckons him to board his boat. Jia complies and the boat takes off, separating husband and wife. In exasperation, Jia's wife jumps into the ocean but is pulled up to the boat by the boatman using a thread of white satin. Jia recognises the boatman as Lang, and they disappear into the horizon. In his postscript, Pu remarks: \\"The fact that Jia felt ashamed and left the world suggests that that he had in him the making of an immortal. Yet he returned to the human world and degraded himself for the need of sustenance. To what extent indeed could poverty reduce a person!\\" Publication history Originally titled \\"Jia Fengzhi\\" (), the story was first published in Pu Songling's anthology of close to five hundred short stories, Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio or Liaozhai Zhiyi. It was translated into English, albeit only partially, by British sinologist Herbert Giles and included in Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio (1880), which is widely regarded as the first substantial translation of Liaozhai. Describing Jia Fengzhi as a \\"Chinese Rip Van Winkle\\", Giles chose to only translate \\"such part of it (the story) as is remarkable for its similarity to Washington Irving's famous narrative\\" and criticised the rest of the story for being \\"long and tedious\\" and \\"devoid of interest\\". Giles makes a similar comment in A History of Chinese Literature (1927), alluding to \\"Jia Fengzhi\\" as a \\"Rip van Winkle story\\". A complete English translation was included in the fifth volume of Strange Tales from Liaozhai by Sidney Sondergard published in 2008. Themes and analysis Several commentators have suggested that \\"Jia Fengzhi\\" is social commentary on the imperial examination system in China during Pu Songling's time. The pursuit of asceticism as an alternative to \\"examination hell\\" is a recurrent theme in Strange Tales, as seen in entries like \\"Jia Fengzhi\\", \\"A Sequel to the Yellow Millet Dream\\", and \\"The Island of Immortals\\"; Karl Kao writes that in contrasting the examinations with Taoism, Pu intended to satirise \\"examiners and impudent candidates\\" and that his postscript in \\"Jia Fengzhi\\" \\"betrays part of the reason of Pu's own continuous attempts to take the examination until an advanced age\\". Li Yu makes a similar argument, comparing \\"Jia Fengzhi\\" with another Strange Tales entry, \\"Student Ye\\", whose title character also has a brilliant mind but constantly fails his examinations. From 1660 to 1702, Pu failed the provincial examination ten times but pinned all the blame on \\"ignorant, incompetent, unfair and greedy examiners\\".

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 2006. Background In the Nara period, after the creation of a centralized government under the Ritsuryō system following the Taika Reform of 645 AD, the provincial capital with associated provincial temple was established for Mutsu Province. These structures only lasted for a short period, as Mutsu Province was only tenuously under the control of the central government, and was subject to frequent uprisings by the native Emishi tribes. This site is believed to have been abandoned in 724 AD when it was relocated to Taga Castle. The Kōriyama ruins are believed to be the ruins of this first attempt at establishing a provincial capital in Mutsu. Description The ruins are located to the south of central Sendai, in between JR Nagamachi Station and the Japan National Route 4 Bypass. It is located on natural embankments with an altitude of about 8-12 meters, and covers an area of approximately 627,900 square meters. Excavations have been conducted since 1979, revealing a residential area from the end of the 6th century, and from the middle of the 7th century to the beginning of the 8th century, two periods of government offices. The earlier (Phase I) government complex is approximately 300 meters east-west by 600 meters north-south, surrounded by a wooden palisade and a double set of moats. The complex is orientated 30 to 40 degrees east of true north. In the centre were granaries and miscellaneous houses, including numerous pit dwellings, which were divided from the administrative complex by an inner palisade measuring 90 meters by 120 meters. The later (Phase II) government complex was a town of four sections (428 square meters), oriented to the north and divided by timber rows and large moats. A large building located in the middle, slightly south of center, is presumed to be the government office, and was found also to contain the remnants of a garden with a pond. Excavated artifacts include numerous examples of Haji ware pottery, some of which was inscribed with the word \\"Natori\\" and roof tiles.  Kōriyama temple ruins The ruined temple complex is to the south, and has the standard temple layout for a provincial temple, as established in each of the provinces of Japan by Emperor Shōmu during the Nara period (710 - 794). In the very lower layers of the site, relics from the late Jōmon period, traces of rice fields from the Yayoi period and traces of residences from the Kofun period were found, indicating that the site was in the center of a major ancient settlement. Currently, most of the site is fallow fields or vacant lots, but the city plans to purchase the area to create a historical park. The site is about a 20-minute walk from Nagamachi Station on the JR East Tohoku Main Line.

The magazine was edited by Sophie Moorcock and Lulu Belliveau, who had previously worked as a photo editor at “On Our Backs“, the first US magazine of women's erotica. Influences included Shocking Pink a young women's zine produced in London between 1979–1992, Chain Reaction a lesbian S/M club that opened in Vauxhall in 1987, and Sheila McLaughlin's 1987 film She Must Be Seeing Things. The magazine had an irregular publication cycle that depended on when funding and content were available. Content and contributors The editorial stance of Quim was anti-censorship and pro-sex, and there was little censorship of content, most of which was submitted by volunteer contributors. Quim featured articles, creative writing, art and photography covering topics including fantasies, orgasm, masturbation, safe sex, sex toys and sadomasochism. In 1991, \\"Quim Notebooks\\" were circulated in gay and lesbian bars and bookshops to encourage contributors to submit stories and ideas to the magazine. The first edition included an interview with Susie Bright, editor of On Our Backs. Issue five centred on the experiences of black lesbians. The sixth and final edition focused on the eviction of a lesbian house and hub for direct action at Bird in Bush Road. The magazine published fiction by authors including Pat Califia, Jane Solanas, Jo Fisk and Leonora Rogers Wright, and photography by Della Grace and Lola Flash.  Reception and legacy  The first issue of the magazine receive a hostile response and it was two years before the second issue was published. Owing to the explicit and sadomasochistic nature of the content, a number of lesbian and gay bookshops, including Sisterwise and Gay's the Word, refused to carry the magazine. The magazine remained controversial and continued to receive unfavourable reviews in the gay press. Quim was later credited, along with On Our Backs, with laying the foundations for later women's erotica including the Australian magazine Slit and Madonna's Sex book.

Pekelharing was born in Zaandam, the sixth child of physician Cornelis and his wife Johanna van Ree. His early studies were in schools at Zaandam. Following the family tradition, he was admitted to study medicine at the University of Leiden in 1865 but his father thought he was too young and let him join after a year spent at home on private studies. During his studies at the University of Leiden, his research interests were sparked by Adriaan Heynsius who in turn had trained under Gerrit Jan Mulder. He also took an interest in histology under F.C. Donders, he joined the University of Utrecht. He received his license to practice medicine in 1872 and managed his father's practice while his parents vacationed abroad. His father died in 1873 and in the same year he married Willemine Geertruida Campert (d. 1897), a sister of a friend. Apart from medical practice he worked in Heynsius' laboratory and wrote a dissertation on the determination of urea in blood and tissues in 1874. Preferring research, he joined a teaching position in the veterinary school in Utrecht, a position suggested by Donders. He spent some in Leipzig under J. Cohnheim learning new laboratory techniques. In 1884 Pekelharing hired Cornelis Winkler with whom he conducted studies on nervous disorders. He collaborated with Professor Sape Talma on leucocytes and inflammation. A bout of sickness led to a period of rest and he was asked to visit Dutch Java in 1886 to examine beriberi. Along with Winkler the two noted that it involved polyneuritis and suggested a bacterial cause. Before leaving Java, Pekelharing suggested a more permanent research facility in Java, and this was taken up by the Dutch government and it was there that Christiaan Eijkman identified a dietary deficiency as the basis of beriberi. Pekelharing too conducted studies on diet with mice and noted the importance of various proteins. He helped establish the field of nutrition research in the Netherlands. He retired in 1918 and died in 1922 at his home in Utrecht.

Biography Razoux Schultz-Metzer was born Cornelia Hendrika Metzer in Doesburg in October 1898, the daughter of Cornelia Jansen and Jacobus Metzer, an army officer and swimming pool manager. After earning a diploma at Arnhem teacher training college in 1919, she taught in Arnhem and the Hague. She married François Marie Razoux Schultz in 1922 and the couple moved to Batavia later the same year when François started an engineering job in the city. The couple had four children between 1923 and 1930.Cor Razoux Schultz-Metzer Atria In 1931 Razoux Schultz-Metzer helped establish the Batavian Association of Housewives and the Indo-European Alliance–Women's Organisation (IEV-VO). Like its partner organisation, the Indo Europeesch Verbond, the IEV-VO advocated for European women and children in the territory. She was also a member of the Dutch East Indies branch of the Dutch Association for Women's Interests and Equal Citizenship. Although women's suffrage had been introduced in the Netherlands in 1919, it had not been extended to its colonies and it remained a central agenda item for members of the Association.

The following year, Governor Bonifacius Cornelis de Jonge appointed her as the first female member of the Volksraad. In 1937 she introduced a motion that called for women's suffrage for all population groups in the territory. Although passive suffrage was introduced, allowing women to stand for election, active suffrage was not. She was reappointed to the Volksraad in 1939, but was on holiday in the Netherlands when the country was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, preventing her from returning for the duration of the war.

History Sacred Heart/Saint Dominic Parish Built between 18961915, it was designed in the Renaissance Revival style by architects Francis H. Fassett and Edward F. Fassett. It is modeled after the Marseille's Notre-Dame de la Garde basilica. It was Francis Fassett's final commission before his 1906 death. It was the city's third Catholic parish. Bishop James Augustine Healy appointed Irish-born Father John O'Dowd as its first pastor. The building's first mass was held on April 4, 1897. In 1997, the Diocese closed nearby St. Dominic's Church and merged the parish into Sacred Heart to form the Sacred Heart/St. Dominic Parish. Located in Portland's densely-built and primarily residential Parkside neighborhood, the Church was founded to serve the city's large Irish-American population. However, by the 2000s, the parish has grown to include a significant population of immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers from Sub-Saharan Africa and Central America. Renovations In 1999, $793,000 was raised to repair the roof and stone exterior; this work was completed in 2001. Further renovations were completed in early 2005. In 2013, a $200,000 capital campaign began to raise funds to restore the church’s bell tower, repair its bell, and repaint the window sashes. However, when renovations began, engineers discovered that more money was needed to repair the roof over the altar. In 2015, local historic preservation organization Greater Portland Landmarks placed Sacred Heart on its \\"Places in Peril\\" due to years of deferred maintenance and repairs and urged its supporters to help fund renovations.

So great were Nathaniel Hawthorne's feelings of guilt, he re- spelled his last name Hathorne to Hawthorne. Family curses in fiction As he lies dying, in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet Mercutio says, \\"A plague o' both your houses,\\" blaming both the Capulets and Montagues. As the play progresses, his words prove prophetic. There is a family curse in The House of the Seven Gables. In Arthur Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles, there was a feeling the Baskerville's family had legendary family curse, of a giant black hound, \\"... a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.\\" In the 2007 South Korean psychological-supernatural suspense horror film Someone Behind You a young woman named Ga-In (Yoon-Jin-seo) sees families and friends slaughtering and attacking one another and realizes that she is followed by an unexplainable curse causing those around her to get rid of her. Despite all of this she is constantly reminded by an eerie student to never trust her family, friends, and not even herself. Ga-In has hallucinations of those who would attempt to attack her, then sees a disturbing vision of a monstrous being warning her that the bloodshed will intensify. The film was also released in America retitled as Voices. Skeptical views Modern skeptics deny that curses of any nature, including family curses, even exist, even if some fervently believe.

A French army under Édouard Mortier invaded Swedish Pomerania in early 1807 and initiated a blockade of the Swedish town of Stralsund, to secure the French rear from enemy attacks. After several smaller sorties and skirmishes around Stralsund, Mortier marched part of his army to support the ongoing Siege of Kolberg, leaving only a smaller force under Charles Louis Dieudonné Grandjean to keep the Swedes at check. The Swedish commander Hans Henric von Essen then commenced a great sortie to push the remaining French forces out of Swedish Pomerania. The French fought bravely on 1 April at Lüssow, Lüdershagen and Voigdehagen, but were eventually forced to withdraw; the Swedes captured Greifswald the next day, after a brief confrontation. The last day of fighting occurred at Demmin and Anklam, where the Swedes took many French prisoners of war, resulting in the complete French withdrawal out of Swedish Pomerania—while the Swedes continued their offensive into Prussia. After two weeks Mortier returned and pushed the Swedish forces back into Swedish Pomerania. After an armistice the French forces once again invaded, on 13 July, and laid siege to Stralsund, which they captured on 20 August; all of Swedish Pomerania was captured by 7 September, but the war between Sweden and France continued until January 6, 1810, when the Swedes were finally forced to sign the Treaty of Paris. Background Because of his hate towards Napoleon, the Swedish king Gustav IV Adolf declared war on France—against the advice of his counsellors—and entered the War of the Third Coalition, on 31 October 1805; after having remained neutral for several years since the events of the French Revolution. The first year of war turned out to be a major disappointment for the Swedes, as only half-hearted attempts were made by the Swedish king to advance his positions, combined with several decisive defeats for his allies. Further setbacks occurred in late 1806, during the War of the Fourth Coalition, as 1,000 unarmed Swedish soldiers were forced into captivity in the Battle of Lübeck, as they were caught in the process of shipping away towards Stralsund. In the beginning of 1807, as the Swedes under Hans Henric von Essen remained passive within Swedish Pomerania, a French army under Édouard Mortier crossed the Swedish border with 12,000 men, and subsequently initiated a blockade of Stralsund on January 30, after some Swedish resistance. The Swedes had about 13,000 men in Stralsund and on the vital island of Rügen, including 3,000 landwehr. After several skirmishes with shifting luck, and as the French numbers quickly dwindled down as they were needed at the Siege of Kolberg—while the Swedish force progressively received reinforcements—the Swedes started planning for a break out by the way of a great sortie. As Mortier quit Stralsund with the bulk of the French army he left a 5,000–6,000 strong division, under Charles Louis Dieudonné Grandjean, to oppose the Swedes. Grandjean, however, soon also sought to leave with the rest of his troops. For this reason he requested a cease-fire, informing Essen of his intention to leave Swedish Pomerania on the condition that the withdrawal would proceed unhindered; it would not be regarded, he noted, as if he had been forced to leave, as a rumoured military defeat could weaken the diplomatic state of France. Battles Swedish Pomerania (centre-right) Essen disregarded the request and instead, on 31 March, prepared his army for a great sortie by splitting it into two columns; the right column, led by Tawast with Essen himself in command, would encircle the left flank of the French forces—it consisted of one battalion each from the Uppland, Jönköping, Dalarna and the Queen's regiments, with six squadrons from the Mörnerian Hussars and four guns, in all 2,500 men; the left column, led by Eberhard von Vegesack with Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt in command, would attack the French center—it consisted of one battalion each from the Skaraborg, Södermanland, Västgöta- Dals, Närke-Värmland and Engelbrecht regiments with one squadron hussars and nine guns, in all 2,300 men. Two battalions of the Bohuslän and Västmanland regiments, in all 900 men with two guns under Cardell, were also left inside Stralsund as reserve. Lüdershagen–Voigdehagen (April 1) The two Swedish columns moved out on 1 April, with Jäger-chains covering their advance; the right column under Essen broke out at 7:00 towards the French redoubt at Kettenhagen, which had been abandoned, while the French forces opposite the Swedish column quickly withdrew. Next Groß Kordshagen was captured, followed by Born and Pütte, where the Swedes took a French magazine, before reaching Langendorf. Meanwhile, the left Swedish column under Armfelt marched out at 8:00 and beat the French from Garpenhagen, Grünhof as well as the battery in front of Langendorf, where the two columns then regrouped. Södermanland infantry Next Lüssow was attacked, which was defended by a couple of hundred French soldiers; only after combined Swedish assaults from both front and flanks, with the support of artillery, could they be beaten back towards Lüdershagen. Here—because of strong fortifications and French reinforcements—an even stronger resistance was offered resulting in several attacks, by Armfelt, being repelled. The French were soon, however, forced to retire as further Swedish reinforcements arrived from Essen's column and jointly stormed the village. The French once again took a stand, this time at the heights of Voigdehagen, where an equally fierce battle ensued which would last for an hour. Meanwhile, a small Swedish detachment under Tawast had been sent out from Essen's column to march southwards, towards Wendorf, to cut-off the French retreat. They got intercepted by strong French forces which came through the forest, between Wendorf and Voigdehagen, with the support of four cannons and two howitzers behind the latter. The French fire got so intense that the Swedish infantry was ordered to go prone in the field while two of their own guns cleared the forest with canister shot. Tawast then attacked the French battery which, combined with the assaults made by Armfelt further to the north, forced the French to retreat from Voigdehagen. The Swedish reserve force, under Cardell, had simultaneously operated in the French right flank; he had repelled a French cavalry attack near Stralsund, after which he successfully assaulted the fortified Hohengraben, followed by Andershof, where the French suffered considerable losses to a Swedish gunboat division. After continuous fighting for several hours the exhausted Swedish left and right columns spent the night at Arendsee and Elmenhorst, respectively. The main French army had retreated to Greifswald during the day, while the baggage train went through Grimmen, all the way to Demmin. French grenadier (left) and voltigeur (right) Greifswald (April 2) Early the next day the Swedish columns continued their march in persecution of the French army; Tawast, with the right column, marched through Glimmen towards Loitz, where he arrived at 18:00 and struck camp for the night. As Armfelt broke camp he separated his force into two individual columns; a left one was led by Cardell and marched on the main road towards Greifswald, while the right column, under Vegesack, marched through Petershagen—Levenhagen—Ungnade, to fall into the rear of the retreating French forces. As a Swedish negotiator with escort approached Greifswald, to ask for their surrender, the French forces panicked and ran; the few hussars in the escort then chased after, into the town, where they made several prisoners. The French forces soon rallied behind the town and counterattacked; the Swedish commander Armfelt got close to being captured in the ensuing struggle. However, as more Swedish troops arrived, the French positions got overwhelmed and they were in-turn thrown back towards Koitenhagen. Three divisions of Swedish gunboats also attacked the village of Wiek, just outside Greifswald, and completely destroyed the sconce there. Cardell and his column, who gained a notable war trophy in Greifswald, spent the night in the town, along with Armfelt; Vegesack's column stayed at Dersekow. Mörner hussar Demmin–Anklam (April 3) The right column, led by Tawast with Essen in command, continued their march from Loitz 8:00 in the morning to intercept the French baggage train, protected by 800 men, at Demmin. As the hussars of the advance guard arrived they immediately charged through the gates—which had been left open—and into the town, where 129 French soldiers were made prisoners. The French forces retreated towards Mecklenburg, with the enemy hot on their heels; four Swedish hussars captured 104 French soldiers on the road leading to Neukalen; 168 men were captured at Dargun by a Swedish squadron, along with rich spoils of war; a French baggage train along with 209 men from the 72nd Infantry Regiment was captured at Krukow, by a mere 42 hussars under Bror Cederström (famous from the Battle of Bornhöved) and Krassow. In the morning Armfelt also broke camp with his two left-columns; Vegsack marched towards Lüssow (Gützkow) and Cardell towards Ziethen and Anklam, where he arrived on the evening, after having crossed the border to Prussia. Armfelt commenced an attack on the suburb with his jägers—without the planned support of the Swedish gunboats—with success; the Swedish jägers traversed the marsh on the sides and, after an hour of musket exchange, forced the defenders to retreat across the Peene and into the town of Anklam itself. The Swedes were unable to repair the bridge, which had been ruined by the retreating French, due to the accurate fire they received from across the river. After a few hours of insignificant firefight, Cardell, with 50 men from the Västmanland Regiment, crossed the river in a pram and launched a surprising bayonet charge which forced the French away from the bridge. While Cardell pursued the baggage train of the fleeing enemy just outside the town, more Swedes made it over and joined the fight; the French force soon routed without offering much of a resistance, leaving the train along with 167 men in the hands of the Swedes. Armfelt's other column, under Vegesack, had reached Jarmen by this time; Swedish Pomerania, as well as the Prussian islands of Usedom and Wolin, had thus been cleared from French troops as the Swedish columns now stood on Prussian soil. Grandjean and the remaining French forces retreated to Stettin. Aftermath The Swedish casualties during the three days of fighting had been low; the left column under Armfelt had lost only 15 men killed and 33 wounded, while the casualties for the right column under Essen are unknown, but few. The losses for the French forces are uncertain; the Swedes had captured at least 1,000 men, or, according to other sources, 1,800 men; with 564 men captured by Essen and 1,245 by Armfelt (including the reserve column). The Swedish king created a Régiment du Roi from captured French soldiers. The war trophy captured by the Swedes had been worth more than 300,000 riksdaler banco, excluding the material captured on Usedom and Wolin, which the French had abandoned during their hasty retreat. News of the Swedish victory in Pomerania arrived on the night between 5–6 April to Malmö and were received with big celebrations in Sweden. As predicted by Grandjean, the news of their defeat produced a certain alarm in the rear of the French army; especially in Berlin, where an humbled enemy \\"sought food for its hopes\\". Siege of Stralsund by Hippolyte Lecomte The Swedish offensive continued for some days as a small commando sneaked into Rostock, on 6 April, and opened the gates for the remaining Swedish force which stood outside ready to storm; the town was captured, along two guns and 148 men of its garrison. Ueckermünde was captured on the same day by a combined Swedish naval and land offensive. The town of Schwerin was likewise captured the next day, as 100 Swedes attacked the garrison of 200 men and, after intense fighting, made 47 of them prisoners—with only one killed and two wounded themselves. This was followed up by the capture of Wolin on the 10th, while an additional 65 French soldiers were captured two days later at Jasenitz, against two killed and three wounded Swedes. The Swedish right flank under Tawast remained in a defensive stance at Demmin while the left, under Armfelt, advanced as far as to the Uecker—instead of withdrawing to a more advantageous position behind the Peene; this resulted in an overextended Swedish defense line with inadequate communication. In his after action report Armfelt explicated the “tenacity and courage of the Swedish soldier” as a reason for his advanced position. French retaliation did not wait as 13,000 men under Mortier arrived from Kolberg and defeated the Swedish left flank on 16 April, at the Battle of Belling; the 2,000 Swedes under Vegesack commenced a fighting retreat, to Anklam and across the Peene. The Swedish retreat left a thousand men under Cardell cut-off at Ueckermünde, where 694 of them were made prisoners. An armistice was signed at Schmatzin on 18 April, initiated by Essen, resulting in the withdrawal of all remaining Swedish troops into Swedish Pomerania. The Swedish king denounced the armistice on 3 July, with a 10-day notice; by this time, however, the Treaties of Tilsit had just deprived Sweden of all her allies but the United Kingdom. A French army under Guillaume Brune crossed the Swedish border on 13 July with 40,000–50,000 men and, after two days of hopeless Swedish resistance, initiated a Siege of Stralsund. Stralsund was captured on 20 August, as the Swedes transferred their forces to the island of Rügen. On 25 August the Swedish island of Dänholm was captured, after which the Swedish troops were allowed free departure to Sweden proper—thus having left all of Swedish Pomerania in French hands by 7 September. Sweden was ultimately forced to surrender on 6 January 1810 and enter the Continental System, after having suffered a Russian invasion from the east, as well as a Danish attack from the west.

Away from Amman about 350 km and from the Jordanian-Saudi border about 15 km. It was used in the Mamluk and Ottoman eras as a stop for caravans of Hajj, and the last pilgrim stations to Al-Shami before the start of the sandy plain in northern Hijaz. History The first construction of this castle was during the period of the Arab prince Salama bin Fawaz bin Rashid Al-Mufarrajah Lami al-Ta’i, the leader of the Arab tribes in the region that is now Jordan, in the year 1495, i.e. the late Mamluk rule of southern Bilad al-Sham. Salama bin Fawaz was the leader of the Lam and Bani Uqba tribes and others that inhabited the Badia at that time.ʻUmar, Samīrah Fahmī ʻAlī (2001) And Arab tribes, and since previous ages, have been concerned with protecting the convoys of the Levant and the Egyptian pilgrims that cross their regions. There was no mention of the citadel in the sources until the Ottomans rebuilt it during the period of rule, and Abdullah Pasha guided me to the governor of Damascus (1142-1145 AH / 1730-1733AD). It is mentioned in the name of the fortress of Jogivan, which is the name known to the Bedouins to date, and the castle: Castle of Mudevira. Building The castle is square shaped with ribs length of 19 m, and the maximum height of the walls is 9 m. At the four corners of the fortress, pillars were constructed one meter above the floor, on which small towers were built. In its walls there are small open holes in two rows, and its northern and western walls have terraces. The walls are built of two types of stones, in which the upper parts differ from the lower parts, which reflects at least two periods in which the reconstruction was made, perhaps they are the difference between the first construction of the era of the Gezivan leader and the second by the Ottomans. Entry to the castle is through a rectangular gate leading to a covered corridor with a barrel vault overlooking a central square measuring 8 x 8 m. The gate is surmounted by a large latch that stands out from the azimuth of the eastern wall, and measures 5.50 x 2.50 m. The ratchet has a front window and a narrow opening on each side. The central square is surrounded by two floors, each consisting of nine rooms, covered with barrel vaults. Ascending to the upper floor was carried out by two stone stairways erected on both sides of the corridor. And its accessories include a pond and a paved road.

Career  Born in Pforzheim, Förtig received his first piano lessons at the age of eight with Hedwig Fuchs and from the age of 11 onwards he received lessons in piano and music theory from Georg Mantel and Heinrich Casimir in Karlsruhe. He made his first public appearances at the age of ten, during which time he wrote his first compositions. 1951 saw the premiere of a composition for the Southwest German Chamber Orchestra Pforzheim; in the same concert he appeared as soloist in Beethoven's first piano concerto in C major. After graduating from the Reuchlin Gymnasium in Pforzheim, he studied from 1953 to 1955 at the Musikhochschule Karlsruhe, where Josef Schelb was his piano and composition teacher. Afterwards he worked as a freelance pianist for two years. In 1957 he continued his studies at the Freiburg Music Academy, where Carl Seemann (piano) and Wolfgang Fortner (composition) were his teachers. In 1961 he became a lecturer, later a decent and from 1969 until his retirement professor for music theory at the University of Music in Freiburg. There he largely restructured the teaching of theory. From 1965 to 1967 he completed supplementary composition studies with Klaus Huber at the Basel Academy of Music. In 1966 Förtig received the Reinhold-Schneider-Preis (Promotion Prize), Culture Prize of the City of Freiburg, in Breisgau. Förtig also received the composition prize for an organ work in Nuremberg. His oeuvre, which now comprises 105 works, includes song cycles with piano or ensemble, choral music with and without instrumental accompaniment, as well as large-scale works for orchestra, choir and soloists, including concertos, and organ music.

Andreas was likely named after his uncle, Manuel's brother, Andreas Palaiologos. Andreas's father had returned from exile under the protection of the Papacy to Constantinople in 1476 and had been generously provided for by Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire, who had conquered the city from Manuel's relatives in 1453. Although Manuel remained a Christian until his death at some point before 1512, Andreas converted to Islam and served as an Ottoman court official. He was the last certain member of the imperial branch of the Palaiologos family.  Biography  Andreas Palaiologos was the oldest son of Manuel Palaiologos and grandson of Thomas Palaiologos, a brother of Constantine XI Palaiologos, the final Byzantine emperor. Although Constantine XI had died defending Constantinople from the Ottomans and Sultan Mehmed II in 1453, and Thomas had fled into exile in 1460, Manuel had travelled to Constantinople in 1476 to throw himself on the mercy of Mehmed II. Previously, Manuel had lived with his brother Andreas under the protection of the papacy in Rome, but a constant cutting of their provided pension had led to a poor financial situation. After having received several disatisfactory offers from various Western European dukes, Manuel was pleased with the generous payment he received from Mehmed II in Constantinople and stayed in the city for the rest of his life. In addition to income, Manuel was also provided with housing and two concubines by the sultan. With these two concubines, or possibly a wife, Manuel fathered two sons; Andreas and John, who died young. Andreas was probably named after Manuel's brother. Manuel died a Christian at some point during the reign of Mehmed II's son and successor, Bayezid II (1481–1512), but Andreas converted to Islam. In 1932, Andreas was identified by Greek Byzantinist Dionysios Zakythinos as the same individual as Mesih Pasha, an Ottoman soldier who partook in a failed attack on Rhodes in 1480. Since Andreas would have been at most four years old at the time, the identification is erroneous. The real Mesih Pasha appears to have had certain Palaiologos descent, however, being the son of a Thomas Palaiologos Gidos. The English historian Steven Runciman writes that the Muslim name of Andreas was Mehmet Pasha and that he served as a court official in Constantinople. Andreas is last attested in 1519Theodore Spandounes, De la origine deli Imperatori Ottomani, Sathas (1890) Tome IX (Paris), p. 175. and is not believed to have had children of his own. With Andreas's death, the descendants of the immediate relatives of the last few Byzantine emperors were rendered extinct.''''''

He was released from prison, possibly due to an administrative error, in 1936 and fled the country. He spent much of his time during the war in the so- called \\"free zone\\" of occupied France. He returned to occupied Germany in November 1945 and took over as editor-in-chief at the Berliner Rundfunk (radio station). A succession of senior political appointments followed till 1950 when, like many senior party officials at around the same time, he abruptly fell from favour. He was grudgingly more or less rehabilitated in 1956, and at one point transferred to the Foreign Ministry: he undertook a diplomatic posting in Geneva between 1959 and 1965 as East Germany's permanent representative to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.  Life = Provenance and early years  Walter Beling was born in Berlin, the son of a tailor. His mother is described simply as a \\"home worker\\". He attended school locally between 1906 and 1913, also finding time to work as a messenger-boy. Between 1913 and 1917 he served an apprenticeship in metal work and engineering, which he combined with six terms as a student at Berlin's Machine Construction Academy (\\"Berliner Maschinenbauschule\\"). After concluding the course at the academy he briefly took office job with a succession of trading businesses. However, notwithstanding his participation in peace demonstrations on the streets of Berlin during 1915 and 1916, by the end of 1916 he had been conscripted for military service. After briefly serving \\"alongside machine gunners\\" he was transferred to the \\"war navy\\" (\\"\\"Kriegsmarine) with four others who, like him, had worked as machinists. According to his own later explanation, this was in order that the five of them might be used as \\"consultants\\" in connection with the ever more \\"feverish\\" programme of submarine construction that was an important feature of the First World War (1914-1918). Thew Kiel mutiny which broke out at the start of November 1918 in response to what was seen as a desperate and suicidal set of orders from the German admirals is widely viewed as a final trigger point which unleased twelve months of riots and insurrections across Germany - especially in the naval ports and industrial heartlands - which came to be known as Germany's November revolution. Beling was stationed in Kiel at the time, and took part in the insurrection, although surviving details of his personal involvement are vague. As the revolt spread across Germany he moved across to Berlin where he took part in the Spartacist uprising at the start of 1919.  Politics  In 1919 Beling became a trades unionist, employed in the manufacturing sector and serving as a shop steward (\\"Betriebsvertrauensmann\\") between 1919 and 1926, a role which several times led to his being picked out for disciplinary measures. In 1924 he became a member of the Communist Party which had been established five years earlier. During 1924/25 he became a leader of a party cell at the business in which he worked, and soon progressed to the role of a party group leader. Between 1926 and 1929 he worked for a time in the commercial sector, while also serving, between 1926 and 1930, as deputy chairman, and then chairman and head of policy (\\"Polleiter\\"), of the party leadership team for the Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg sub-region.  Party official  During 1928 he started working for the party central committee, employed in the treasury department under the leadership of comrade Artur Golke the party treasurer. In 1930 Walter Beling took over as head of the finance department, a position he held under Golke's direction until April 1933. Between 1929 and 1931 he also served as a member of the party leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for Berlin. During 1932 he spent some time in Amsterdam on party business. Later that year he spent six months attending a \\"teacher training\\" course at the party academy just outside Berlin. After that he himself became involved in party education at various locations round the country during 1932/33.  Régime change  In January 1933 Adolf Hitler took advantage of several years of intensifying political polarisation and parliamentary deadlock to take power. The new government lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire which broke out overnight on 27/28 February 1933 was instantly blamed on \\"communists\\". A decree signed off on 28 February opened the way for a rapid assault on civil liberties, and within 24 hours large numbers of known Communist Party leaders and officials had been rounded up by the security services. Beling avoided capture and continued with his party work. Artur Golke fled abroad and Beling took over as national treasurer of the now \\"underground\\" communist party, identified by comrades with the party pseudonym of \\"Wallbaum\\".  Arrest and conviction  It is reported and repeated that Beling's whereabouts was betrayed to the security services by Werner Kraus and Paul Grobis. It is certainly widely attested that the long-standing communist official and politician Werner Kraus was arrested early in July 1933, and almost immediately (possibly under torture) \\"changed sides\\", quickly betraying a number of former comrades. Walter Beling was arrested in Berlin on 20 July 1933 and badly tortured. In order to avoid problems arising from \\"wrong\\" decisions emerging from the established German justice system, the government had, in 1933, revived the old tradition of using \\"special courts\\" for political trials. The trial of Walter Beling, whose political activity self- evidently amounted to anti-government resistance, was clearly political, and on 21 March 1935 the special \\"Peoples' Court\\" sentenced him to a thirty month prison term for undertaking activities on behalf of the (since 1933 illegal) Communist Party.  Exile  Beling spent the first part of his sentence in Berlin's Plötzensee Prison. Later he was moved to the prison at nearby Luckau. In January 1936 he was unconditionally released. The reason for his early release is unclear. According to one source his release was not notified to the security services, due to a \\"technical oversight\\". Although he was presumably kept under close surveillance, in February 1936 he managed to escape to Prague which, along with Moscow and Paris, had by this time become a principal centre for hundreds of German political refugees. In Prague he resumed his employment with the party central committee. His duties included the editorship of the party's German-language newspaper, \\"Deutschland- Informationen\\". In November 1936 Beling moved on again, this time to Paris. Here he was a member of the party's western leadership team (\\"KPD- Abschnittsleitung West\\"), again working in the party's treasury department. Between 1936 and 1939 he was, in addition, a contributing editor to the party newspapers and journals, \\"Rote Fahne\\", \\"Internationale\\" and \\"Rundschau\\". During 1937/38 he supported the \\"freedom struggle of the Spanish people\\" through his work for the Madrid-based German-language radio station \\"Deutscher Freiheitssender 29,8\\".  War  The British and French governments both reacted to the outbreak of war in September 1939 by promptly rounding up and interning several thousand German political refugees from Nazism who, after 1933, had hitherto found a relatively safe refuge in their countries. German communists based in Paris such as Walter Beling were arrested at the start of this process, in September 1939: Beling was then interned in a succession of camps. The camps used were in the south-west of France, having been set up in 1938/39 to accommodate returning fighters following the Nationalists' victory in the Spanish Civil War. Tight security had not been a priority when they were constructed: in June 1940 Walter Beling escaped. In the immediate aftermath of the German invasion he was now in the so-called \\"free zone\\" of France, administered by a puppet government under the leadership of the wartime hero, Philippe Pétain. Following his escape, Walter Beling made his way to Toulouse, where he lived and worked unregistered (meaning \\"illegally\\"). Toulouse was already becoming a focus for German communist exiles who had escaped from camps in southern France, or simply made their way south when the German army invaded France from the north in May 1940. Links were established to French communists who were becoming a leading element in the Résistance movement against the German military occupation in the north and the Pétain puppet government in the south. From the time of his escape Beling was therefore part of a well supported underground activist network. His party role at this time is variously described: according to at least one source he was the German party leader for the Toulouse region, identified by comrades under the party pseudonyms of \\"Claude\\" or \\"Clément\\". In September 1940 Beling came to an agreement with Maurice Tréand (who was representing the Central Committee of the French Communist Party in their discussions together) which led to the establishment of the so-called Travail allemand (literally, \\"German work\\") sub-section inside the French Résistance organisation. This provided important underpinning for closer collaboration between German communists operating \\"underground\\" in occupied France and Résistance comrades, reducing the mutual suspicion which was inherent in the situation. The Résistance was able to provide extensive \\"infrastructure support\\", including provision of counterfeit identity documents whereby German communists having acquired the necessary language skills could blend into the surrounding francophone population. Résistance comrades were also often able to arrange hiding places as the German occupation became more oppressive and, especially after 1942, German security service personnel were frequently to be encountered on French streets, even in the so-called \\"free zone\\". Although sources are largely silent about Beling's resistance activity in France, reports survive of his involvement in attempts to free Franz Dahlem, a senior German Communist politician both before and after the twelve Hitler years. During the first part of 1941 the Résistance organised a mass break-out from the camp at Le Vernet, when Dahlem was being held, but for some reason Dahlem was not among those who managed to escape, and the German officials, evidently fully aware of Dahlem's political importance ordered the French puppet government to hand him over immediately. In the event, apparently very much against the odds, Dahlem survived a succession of Gestapo interrogations and subsequent internment in camps in Germany, but the attempts to secure his freedom in which Beling was involved must nevertheless be counted a failure, and on 12 December 1941 it was Walter Beling who was spotted in Marseilles and (again) arrested: he was sentenced to a six month prison term. He was interned in the nearby Camp des Milles. He was not released at the end of his six month sentence. Faced with the accelerating threat that he might be sent back to Germany, where the interrogation would probably be more intense and conditions of detention worse, at the start of September 1942 Beling again managed to escape from the camp in which he was being held and re-engaged in the Résistance. During his time in France, Beling also came into contact with Noel Field. Noel Field was an Anglo-American spy: through several intervening generations sources have differed strikingly over whether his ultimate loyalty, in matters of espionage, was to the Soviet Union or to the United States of America and their respective proxies. In 1941 Field became head of the Marseilles-based US Unitarian Universalist Service Committee which won plaudits from many sides, providing relief for escaping Jewish refugees, antifascists and leftists, and helping many to flee to Switzerland or North America. It is hard to determine the extent to which Beling and Field ever worked together. What is clear, however, is that in the spirit of cold war mistrust that came about after 1945, and which could border on paranoia, Walter Beling's involvement wth Noel Field would cost him very dearly. As the was entered its final phase, during 1943/44 Beling was a member of the \\"Comité Allemagne libre pour l’Ouest\\", a western version of the National Committee for a Free Germany that had grown up among German prisoners of war with the backing of the Soviet authorities in the (very much larger) prison camps of the Soviet Union.  Soviet occupation zone  War ended in May 1945, leaving the western two thirds of Germany divided into four military occupation zones. Walter Beling returned to Berlin in November 1945, making his home in the part of the city that had become part of the Soviet occupation zone (to be relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic / East Germany). Almost immediately he accepted an appointment as editor in chief of Berliner Rundfunk, a radio station which despite initially having its studios physically located in a district of Berlin administered by the British Military, had been established by the Soviet Military Administration and operated under the direction of the Soviet military authorities. He held his post in charge of the radio station through much of 1946. April 1946 saw the launch of the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), formed through a contentious merger of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. In the Soviet zone hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members and a large number of SPD members lost no time in signing their party memberships over to the new party, determined that divisions on the political left should never again leave the way open to a successful populist power grab on behalf of the political right. The organisational structure of the SED was, initially, relatively fluid. In 1947 Walter Beling became a member of the \\"Parteivorstand (PV)\\", the executive body that managed what became, between 1946 and 1949, the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. He was also elected, at the party congress of September 1947 to membership of the Central Secretariat of the \\"Parteivorstand\\". As the SED evolved between 1946 and 1949, its organisational structure aligned ever more closely with that devised by Lenin for the Soviet Communist Party. At some point the \\"Parteivorstand\\" mutated into a Soviet-style Party Central Committee. Sources avoid spelling out whether Beling's \\"Parteivorstand\\" membership was ever formally translated into membership of the Central Committee: within then party management structure over which the Central Committee presided, he did become head of the Finance Department and of the Party Administration (\\"Geschäftsangelegen\\") Department. Along with his party functions, in 1948 Beling found himself installed as \\"sole shareholder\\" (\\"Alleingesellschafter\\") of \\"Konzentration GmbH\\", a politically oriented printing and publishing operation, recently taken under government control. Sources differ over whether it was in 1948 or 1950 that Walter Beling married Theodora (Thea) Saefkow (born Brey: 1909 - 1990), a miner's daughter and another energetic political activist who, like him, had spent the war years operating \\"underground\\" as a Résistance activist in occupied France.  Fall from favour in the German Democratic Republic  The arrest on 30 May 1949 of László Rajk in Budapest and the confssions extracted from Rajk under torture became the starting point for a succession of show trials. It came a couple of weeks after the arrest in Prague of Noel Field, who was handed over to the Hungarian authorities following his arrest. The premise of Field's trial, which opened in September 1949, was that during the war he had, with his agents, worked to undermine the development of indigenous resistance, in order to strengthen Western influence and create a divided postwar Germany. Noel Field was \\"one of the leaders of American espionage,\\" who \\"specialized in recruiting spies from among left-wing elements.\\" Field was badly and repeatedly tortured and held in solitary confinement for the next five years. For the party leadership in East Germany, under intensifying pressure from popular discontent and a faltering economy, the Field affair provided an opportunity to remove from positions of influence a large number of party officials who were suspected of quietly harbouring their own ideas about the future of socialism. The party leadership in East Berlin consisted largely of men who had spent the war years in Moscow, planning in considerable detail a Soviet-style \\"socialist\\" future for Germany. At the end of April 1945 a tight-knit group of 30 men had arrived from Moscow and intensively set about their nation building project. After the events of 1948 it became apparent that they would need to abandon dreams of imposing their blue print across all four occupation zones, but the implementation of their plan continued to unfold, fully backed by military administration, in the Soviet zone. Leadership paranoia extended to an intensifying fear that comrades who had spent the war years not in Moscow but in \\"the west\\" might not be true believers in \\"the plan\\". A wave of arrests began in 1950. The most high profile victim among the senior party officials caught up in the political purge was Paul Merker. An intriguingly high proportion of the purge victims were men who had spent the war years in France. Walter Beling was an energetic senior party official who had spent the war years in France. During that period he had been in contact with Noel Field. In August 1950 he was stripped of his entire portfolio of party functions \\"on account of his links in exile with Noel H. Field\\". The shock of the experience was so great that Beling was judged medically unfit for work till November 1951. Beyond politics Between 1951 and 1955 Beling worked at \\"VEB Kranbau Eberswalde\\", a crane manufacturing enterprise where he worked initially as a \\"Normensachbearbeiter\\", concerned with conformity and quality of production. He subsequently becamedeputy head and then head of the business organisation department and later \\"kommissarischer Arbeitsdirektor\\", concerned with labour issues at the facility.  Partial return to respectability  The death of Stalin in 1953 and the growing awareness of Nikita Khrushchev's \\"secret\\" speech, delivered early in 1956, marked a slow easing of the political paranoia at the heart of the East German political establishment. The party exhonerated Beling in July 1956 which involved setting aside the party punishments imposed in August 1950. This fell some way short of a full formal rehablitation, but subsequent developments in his career followed by the awarding of certain state honours confirmed at least that Walter Beling was no longer regarded, within the party, as beyond the political pale. It was still July 1956 when he accepted a posting to the Foreign Ministry as head of the main \\"Europe\\" department. He then served, bnetween 1959 and 1965, as East Germany's permanent representative to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The job was based in Geneva: in a country where foreign travel was a rare privilege rather than a right, the posting to Switzerland indicates that any involvement with Noel Field was long forgiven or forgotten by the East German party leadership. Death Walter Beling died in Berlin on 31 May 1988, so did not live to experience all the changes that led to reunification. He predeceased his wife by less than two years. Their physical remains have been placed together in the special Memorial to the socialists section at the Friedrichsfelde main cemetery.

Winpenny's research is within the fields of inorganic chemistry and magnetochemistry, specifically the areas of single-molecule magnetism, inorganic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry and polymetallic caged complexes.  Education  Winpenny was educated at Sandfields Comprehensive School, Port Talbot, where he was influenced by his excellent chemistry teachers, John Hardie and Vivien Davies, to study chemistry at university. He thus completed both his Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degree at Imperial College London in 1985 and 1988 respectively. His PhD on New heterometallic polynuclear complexes was supervised by David Goodgame.  Research and career  Upon completing his PhD, Winpenny completed his postdoctoral research with John Fackler, Jr at Texas A&M; University from 1988 to 1989 where he researched on mass spectrometry of gold clusters. In 1990, he joined the University of Edinburgh as an academic, and in 2000, moved to The University of Manchester as the chair of inorganic chemistry. Winpenny was the Associate Dean for Research in the University of Manchester Faculty of Science and Engineering from September 2008 to April 2010. He was also the director of the Photon Science Institute from October 2009 to April 2014. Winpenny was also the head of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Manchester from August 2014 to April 2018, and is the director and chief scientific officer at Sci-Tron(Ltd.). He was also awarded Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Established Career Fellowship (January 2018 to December 2022) and also holds a European Research Council Advanced Fellowship from September 2018 to August 2022.  Notable work  Winpenny is classed as one of the leading synthetic chemists of polymetallic cage complexes. He has developed a wide range of heterometallic rings as a new class of molecular magnets, which have been exploited to develop new physics and techniques with proposals to use them in quantum information processing. These rings also show unique capabilities to act as resist materials for electron beam lithography (EBL). A wide range of literature has been published by Winpenny on the synthesis, structural and property analysis of heterometallic rings, polymetallic cages, single molecule magnets, and f-block and d-block metal complexes. The published work by Winpenny has gained more than 24,000 citations as of 2020. In 2007, Winpenny also reported the first intrinsic spin-lattice (T1) and phasecoherence (T2) relaxation times in molecular nanomagnets. The results showed that the value of T2 in deuterated samples were of several orders of magnitude longer than the duration of spin manipulations which satisfies the prerequisite for the deployment of molecular nanomagnets in quantum information applications. In 2016, a research led by Winpenny, Nicholas F. Chilton and Yan‐Zhen Zheng was able to report a monometallic dysprosium complex which showed the largest effective energy barrier to magnetic relaxation of Ueff = 1815 K. The research also showed the largest blocking temperature (TB) for a monometallic complex.

Together with War Resisters' International, which is also one of its members, it is considered one of the leading international NGOs working on conscientious objection.  Objectives  ECBO stands up for the right to conscientious objection to abstain from warfare or any other military activity as well as from preparations to them. They claim this right as a human right. They lobby for the right to asylum for conscientious objectors, if their home countries don't recognise their rights accordingly. They also promote the abolition of conscription as well as cuts in military budgets.  Activities  The organisation creates a network between national organisations from Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Russia., Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and United Kingdom. Since 2017, Friedhelm Schneider from Germany acts as the organisation's president. The organisation lobbied for European countries to sign and ratify the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. ECBO writes reports and conducts research on conscientious objection around Europe. Since at least 2008, ECBO writes an annual repport on conscientious objection and civilian service for the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. ECBO has participatory status with the Council of Europe since 1998. Since 2005, it is also a member of the INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe. Since 1995, it is a full member of the European Youth Forum.

The goal of the conference was to acknowledge the wide-spread use of traditional medicine, review the role of traditional healers in HIV prevention and care, and support collaboration between traditional medicine and biomedicine. This conference also led to the formation of an East and Southern African Regional Task Force on Traditional Medicine and HIV/AIDS in 2001Homsy, Jaco, et al.

Traditional medicine in Uganda  Before the Colonial Era, traditional medicine was the only health system in Uganda. During the Colonial Era from 1894 to 1962, traditional medicine was suppressed as it was negatively seen as \\"backwards\\" and \\"witchcraft\\", and the legitimacy of healthcare practice was placed on biomedicine. Gradually, there have been several attempts to provide support to traditional healers, legally recognize traditional medicine practice in Uganda, and move towards collaboration between the two practices.Yahaya, Sekaya, et al. “Traditional Medicine in Uganda: Historical Perspectives, Challenges, and Advances.” World Bank, 2004, documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/208041468121755812/pdf/312570iknt67.pdf. For example, since the early 1990s, the WHO has pushed for the inclusion of traditional medicine in national programs.Kayombo, Edmund J., Febronia C. Uiso, Zakaria H. Mbwambo, Rogasian L. Mahunnah, Mainen J. Moshi, and Yasin H.

HIV/AIDS  The Ugandan AIDS Control Programme of 1989 by the Ministry of Health promoted decentralization of AIDS prevention and control from the national level to the district level in order to increase coverage and effectiveness. This highlighted community-based approaches involving biomedical health staff, NGOs, religious groups, local village leaders, local AIDS committees, and traditional healers.Ankrah, E. Maxine. “AIDS and the Social Side of Health.” Social Science & Medicine, vol. 32, no. 9, Jan. 1991, pp. 967–80. ScienceDirect, . For HIV/AIDS victims, traditional healers provided a local, familiar, and accessible option compared to biomedical personnel who were usually overbooked and located farther away.Liddell, Christine; Barrett, Louise; Bydawell, Moya (2005). \\"Indigenous representations of illness and AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa\\". Social Science & Medicine. Elsevier BV. 60 (4): 691–700. In the early 1980s in southwestern Uganda, it was reported that many locals infected with the disease (\\"Slim\\") after showing symptoms of diarrhea and weight-loss would initially consult traditional healers due to their belief in the connection between the disease and witchcraft.Iliffe, J.; Anderson, D.; Brown, C.; Clapham, C.; Gomez, M.; Manning, P.; Robinson, D. (1998). \\"10. AIDS\\". East African Doctors: A History of the Modern Profession. African Studies. Cambridge University Press. . Retrieved 8 June 2020. In local communities, traditional healers were seen as having a respected and credible role in treating physical, psychological, and spiritual aspects of health, serving approximately 80% of people.Green, Edward C. “Can Collaborative Programs between Biomedical and African Indigenous Health Practitioners Succeed?” Social Science & Medicine, vol. 27, no. 11, Jan. 1988, pp. 1125–30.

The tender and evaluation was monitored by the UK electrical engineering firm Merz & McLellan in London. GIPR ordered the following test locomotives in 1923. The first WCP-1 was quite successful so in 1938, a single replica locomotive with the number 4025 was ordered, which had the same construction as the other locomotives, but was nevertheless classified in a new series. The electrical equipment from Metrovick was installed in the halls of the SLM in Winterthur. After the voltage test, the locomotive body was lifted off the driving wheels and the bogies and the engines removed. For transport, it was placed on two special bogies of a SBB flat bed wagon and shipped on the rails to Antwerp, where it was loaded onto the cargo ship to India. In Bombay, the locomotive box was put back on the undercarriage and brought on its own wheels to the main workshop in GIPR, where the locomotive was fully assembled and then went into operation. The locomotive remained in use until the 1980s and was given after being condemned at the Nehru Science Center in Bombay. Specification Loading of the locomotive body onto the cargo ship to India. The locomotive has three individually driven axles, a two-axle bogie at one end and a single axle at the other end of the locomotive. The Winterthur bogie had a pivoting pivot that was centered with springs. The individual running axle was combined with the neighboring driving axle to form a Java bogie, which is why the locomotive had the axle sequence 2’Bo (A1) and not, as often written, 2’Co1. Two drive motors each drive a drive axle via an SLM universal drive. The engines were arranged high in the engine room, which on the one hand gave the locomotive a favorable center of gravity, and on the other hand it protected it from damage during the frequent floods in Bombay when traveling through water. The engines could be removed laterally through maintenance openings in the lower area of the machine room side wall. The locomotive's box extended the entire length of the frame. The engine room between the two cabs was divided into three rooms. The brake equipment with vacuum pump and the compressor with air reservoir were in the first room, the switchgear for the electro-pneumatic control was in the second room and the starting resistors were in the third room. The approach took place with all six traction motors connected in series, then two groups of three motors in series and finally three groups with two motors in series were formed. Two field weakening levels were available in each group, so that the locomotive had a total of nine continuous driving stages.

Facts  The case arose from a challenge by 'Ms B', who had become paralysed from the neck down after a spinal haemorrhage, to the hospital caring for her after doctors refused her requests to be taken off the ventilator that was keeping her alive. Ms B had previously suffered a haemorrhage on her spine, for which she was successfully rehabilitated, and was advised that any future haemorrhaging would likely cause severe disability. Because of that advice, Ms B took out a living will stating that if she were to ever be unable to give instructions, she would want any medical treatment withdrawn in the case of a life-threatening illness, permanent mental impairment or permanent unconsciousness. Despite the existence of the living will, Ms B's doctors denied her request to be removed from ventilation claiming the living will was too vague, after which she made a formal request through her solicitor. Before acting on the formal request, the hospital organised two independent psychiatric assessments of Ms B. She eventually underwent mulitple assessments over five months due to the conflicting opinions of psychiatrists. After finally being declared mentally competent, Ms B was not granted her wish to be removed from ventilation but was instead given two alternative options: slow weaning from the ventilator without pain relief or being sent to a hospice, both of which she refused. Ms B's request was then taken to the High Court of Justice's Family Division for a decision. Following the court's decision in her favour, Ms B was moved to a hospital that removed her from ventilation, where she died on April 29, 2002.  Judgement  In her judgement, Elizabeth Butler-Sloss ruled that she was 'entirely satisfied that Ms B is competent to make all relevant decisions about her medical treatment including the decision whether to seek to withdraw from artificial ventilation. Her mental competence is commensurate with the gravity of the decision she may wish to make.' She also ruled that Ms B had been treated unlawfully by the hospital since the time she had been assessed as mentally competent. The judgement cited contributing factors to unlawful treatment were the inability of hospital staff to consider Ms B's request objectively; offering her treatments that prioritised doctors and clinicians over Ms B; the Hospital Trust not providing guidance for staff for deciding ethical issues.  Other cases  The announcement of Ms B's death came on the same day a woman paralysed from the neck down from advanced motor neuron disease, Diane Pretty, lost a legal battle in the European Court of Human Rights for the right to die with the help of her husband. Despite the difference between Ms B seeking removal of treatment and Diane Pretty seeking assisted suicide, the similarities between the cases sparked public debate about inconsistencies in the law regarding the right to die.

Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they race to stop the Chronicoms from unraveling history in the 1970s. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by DJ Doyle and directed by Aprill Winney. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward. The episode remains in 1976 after the characters traveled to that year in the previous episode. Guest stars Enver Gjokaj, reprising his role of Daniel Sousa from the MCU series Agent Carter, and Patrick Warburton, reprising his role as Rick Stoner from season five, return from previous episodes in the season. \\"Adapt or Die\\" originally aired on ABC on July 1, 2020, and was watched by 1.32 million viewers. Plot Following the events of \\"A Trout in the Milk\\", against General Rick Stoner's orders, the Lighthouse automatically fires missiles at Zephyr One, damaging the time drive. While Deke Shaw, Jemma Simmons, and Enoch attempt to repair it, Deke discovers that Simmons has a memory implant that blocks her knowledge of Leo Fitz's location while retaining information on time travel. Simmons urges Deke not to reveal this to the others. While in Stoner's custody, Melinda May identifies a Chronicom infiltrator with her empathetic abilities and its lack of emotions. Deducing the Chronicoms are replacing S.H.I.E.L.D.'s agents with their Hunters, she and the Phil Coulson LMD escape from their detainment and save Stoner before the Chronicoms can steal his face and memories. Along the way, Coulson discovers the Chronicoms' ship and encounters their predictor Sibyl. After speaking with her about the Chronicoms' plans, he sacrifices himself to destroy their ship and Hunters while May and Stoner escape. Meanwhile, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez and Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie rescue the latter's parents from the Lighthouse and meet up with May. While escaping in their quinjet however, May realizes that Mack's parents are actually Chronicoms who killed and replaced the real ones, forcing Mack to throw them from the quinjet. Concurrently, Nathaniel Malick experiments on Daisy Johnson and transplants her Inhuman powers to himself. However, he is unable to control them as they break his bones and demolish the building around him, allowing Daisy and Daniel Sousa to escape and return to Zephyr One. After it jumps to 1982, Daisy is placed in a healing pod while Mack steps out to mourn. Deke leaves to check on him, but they are stranded when Zephyr One unexpectedly jumps through time again. Production=Development After the sixth season finale of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. aired in August 2019, showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell revealed that the seventh season would feature the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later that month, one of the season's episodes was revealed to be titled \\"Adapt or Die\\" and written by DJ Doyle. It was confirmed to be the sixth episode of the season in June 2020, when Aprill Winney was revealed to have directed it. Winney had shadowed Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. director Garry A. Brown in season six, as \\"Adapt or Die\\" was her first time directing a television episode with stunts and visual effects; Winney previously worked more on kids and family television. Writing This episode introduces Jemma Simmons' biological implant, which she has named D.I.A.N.A. (Digital Implanted Axon Neurotransmission Attenuator). Simmons actress Elizabeth Henstridge had gotten engaged during the previous episode and named her engagement ring Diana, speaking openly about the ring by that name when Henstridge returned to filming. As such, Tancharoen reached out to Henstridge letting her know the writers and producers decided to call the implant D.I.A.N.A. as well. Casting With the season renewal, main cast members Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, Daisy Johnson / Quake, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, and Deke Shaw, respectively. Series star Clark Gregg also returns as Phil Coulson, portraying a Life Model Decoy version of the character in the seventh season. Guest starring in the episode are Joel Stoffer as Enoch, Tamara Taylor as Sibyl, Tobias Jelinek as Luke, Thomas E. Sullivan as Nathaniel Malick, Paulina Bugembe as Lilla MacKenzie, Dawan Owens as Agent Ford, Sedale Threatt Jr. as John MacKenzie, Patrick Warburton as General Rick Stoner, and Enver Gjokaj reprising his Agent Carter role of agent Daniel Sousa; all returning from earlier episodes of the season. They are joined by Shakira Barrera as Agent King. Filming Director of photography Kyle Jewell suggested a crane be used when filming in Sibyl's void, which director Aprill Winney felt helped \\"bring the dynamism\\" to an empty room with two people. Release \\"Adapt or Die\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on July 1, 2020. Reception=Ratings In the United States the episode received a 0.3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.3 percent of all households in that demographic. It was watched by 1.32 million viewers. Within a week of release, \\"Adapt or Die\\" was watched by 2.38 million viewers. Critical response The A.V. Clubs Alex McLevy gave the episode a \\"B\\", saying the episode \\"successfully integrates its various subplots with optimal pacing\\" thanks to \\"strong direction and a solid script\\". Coulson's conversation with Sibyl \\"was elegantly crafted, giving him a chance to deliver a stirring speech about humanity without it feeling trite or hokey\\". He called the Simmons subplot explaining about her memory chip the episode's only weak spot. McLevy concluded, \\"It wasn't always fun to watch, but for being one of the show's periodic downer installments, it remained lively and compelling throughout, balancing the adventure and pathos more successfully than in\\" the last episode. Michael Ahr of Den of Geek felt the failures endured in the episode made \\"for the perfect season midpoints as the characters face the most overwhelming odds yet, framing what will presumably be their seemingly impossible comeback in the back half\\", giving the episode 4.5 stars out of 5. Trent Moore at Syfy Wire felt Coulson's line \\"Dying? It’s kind of my superpower.\\" was \\"one of the show’s greatest\\" and that Sousa and Daisy had \\"a great bit of chemistry\\" in their scenes, noting \\"Sousa really gets a chance to shine\\". Matt Webb Mitovich from TVLine said that after the first five episodes had \\"light-hearted time-travel hijinks\\", \\"Adapt or Die\\" had \\"harder-hitting drama\\" which resulted in an \\"incredibly eventful episode\\". Giving the episode a \\"B-\\", Christian Houlb at Entertainment Weekly said the episode \\"reach[s] new depths for the season\\" and called Mack learning his parents were Chronicoms \\"the most brutal stuff in [the] episode\\". Wesley Coburn from Bam! Smack! Pow! was more critical of the episode, giving it a \\"C\\", and saying it \\"answers a lot of questions, but at the expense of character development and excessive action.\\".

She has served as Chair of the British HIV Association, which championed the Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U) campaign in the United Kingdom.  Early life and education  Orkin was born in Johannesburg. She joined the University of the Witwatersrand as a medical student. She trained as a physician in the largest hospital in Soweto in the 1990s. At the time, between 30 and 40% of hospital inpatients were infected with HIV, and Orkin herself lost 10 colleagues to AIDS. She became increasingly interested in virology and immunology. She graduated from medical school in 1995 before moving to the United Kingdom. She completed her specialist training in HIV/AIDS and Genitourinary Medicine at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. She was ten years younger than the other specialist registrars. Towards the end of her specialist training, Orkin moved to Botswana to establish an HIV/AIDS treatment programme.  Research and career  In the mid 2000s Orkin joined Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry as a consultant physician. Her work considers the development of antiretroviral therapies and blood-bourne virus testing. Orkin has been involved with several initiatives to increase testing rates of HIV/AIDS, and in 2015 she launched Going Viral, a week to raise awareness of blood-borne viruses. The week-long campaign offered HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C testing in emergency departments around the United Kingdom. It proposed an opt-out blood-borne disease testing strategy. Over 3% of the cohort, who were tested as part of their routine blood tests, were infected with blood-borne diseases, and the prevalence was strongest in men aged between 35 and 55. The campaign was supported by several high profile celebrities, including Tim Westwood, Elton John amd Sadie Frost. She was the first to lead a phase III clinical trial into the use of injectable anti-retrovirals. After appearing on ITV News to discuss the treatment, she was attacked on social media by misogynistic and homophobic slurs. This experience led her to become more aware of the gender and sexuality-based discrimination. Shortly after she was elected President of the Medical Women's Federation. Orkin has served as Chair of the British HIV Association. In 2018 Orkin and the British HIV Association announced their commitment to the Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U) campaign.

He only finished and published the book on de Croÿ's ancient coin collection in 1615 in Antwerp under the title Imperatorum Romanorum numismata aurea a Julio Cæsare ad Heraclium continua serie collecta Et Ex Archetypis Expressa (A continual series of gold coins of the Roman Emperors from Julius Cesar to Heraclius collected and expressed through the originals). The publication contains 64 plates reproducing the Roman coin collection of Charles. The frontispiece was engraved by de Bie after a design by Peter Paul Rubens.Jacob de Bie, Imperatorum Romanorum Numismata Aurea a Julio Cæsare Ad Heraclium Continua Serie Collecta, Et Ex Archetypis Expressa.

Not long after losing his employment the Archdukes Albert and his consort Isabella, who were the then joint governors of the Southern Netherlands, appointed the painter Otto van Veen as the waerdeyn ('warden') of the revived Brussels Mint. With this nomination, the Archduke Albert and his consort Isabella fulfilled two very different goals. Firstly, they wanted to find a decent position for their beloved but ageing painter, and merely followed what had previously been done in 1572 when the great sculptor and medalist Jacques Jonghelinck had been made waerdeyn of the Antwerp Mint. Secondly, they needed to put at the head of the Brussels Mint a competent person, since they were then involved in launching a new series of coins as part of a general monetary reform.Olga Vassilieva- Codognet, Coining Neo-Stoic Hieroglyphs: from the Brussels Mint to Emblemata sive symbola, in: Otto Vaenius and his Emblem Books, ed. Simon McKeown (Glasgow Emblem Studies, 15), Glasgow 2012, pp. 211–248 Otto van Veen appears not to have been very enthusiastic about his new appointment as he tried to resign not long after taking up his office. This may have been linked to the difficult relaunch of the Brussels Mint. Otto van Veen who knew of Jacob de Bie's interest in ancient coins offered him the position of maître particulier at the Brussels Mint. The maître particulier was in charge of buying the required quantity of precious metals and organizing the coin production. Jacob de Bie accepted the position, but he soon found himself in trouble because he was blamed for the low quality of the coins produced. The blame rested in fact with the essayeur, the person responsible for the quality of the coins struck at the Mint. This essayeur was a certain Frans van den Driessche who was, however, not personally responsible for the quality problem. It was his two sons who, when they replaced their father during his absences, only produced low-quality coins. When this was discovered, Jacob de Bie was held responsible and he went on the run. Although his name was subsequently cleared, he had again lost his position. Conversation with Nicodemus from Passio et Resvrrectio Iesv Christi After his failure at the Brussels Mint, Jacob de Bie finally published his book on Charles de Croÿ's ancient coin collection in 1615-1616. Due to his passion for coins, he had bought old stocks of numismatic books written by Hubert Goltzius together with an original and unpublished manuscript by the same author. Goltzius was famous in his time for the important books on ancient numismatics that he had published in the 1560-70s. Jacob de Bie managed to publish the unpublished manuscripts of Goltzius, but he was bankrupted by the small print run and its poor quality. In a letter of 1623 the French antiquarian Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc wrote to his close friend Rubens about la mala sorte del Signor de Bie (the bad luck of mister de Bie). De Peiresc offered his help. Peiresc wanted to buy Goltzius' manuscripts from Jacob de Bie. Nothing came of all this and it was left to the Plantin Press in Antwerp to eventually publish Goltzius' books twenty years later. Again out of work and without money, Jacob de Bie left for Paris. Here he published several well-printed and successful books on numismatics. In Paris he also published in 1634 the work, which would ensure his fame, entitled Les vrais portraits des rois de France tirez de ce qui nous reste de leurs monumens, sceaux, medailles, ou autres effigies, conseruées dans les plus rares & plus curieux cabinets du royaume : au tres-chrestien roy de France et de Nauarre, Louis XIII ('The real portraits of the kings of France as taken from what remains of their monuments, seals, medals, or other effigies, preserved in the rarest & most curious cabinets of the kingdom: to the very Christian king of France and Navarre, Louis XIII'). Dedicated to the French king Louis XIII, this was the first well-researched and complete series of portraits of the Kings of France. In the preface de Bie explained his source material for creating the images: he used tombs for the 'première race' (i.e. the Merovingian kings), seals for the 'seconde race' (i.e. the Carolingian kings), and paintings and medals for the 'troisième race (i.e. the Capetian kings). For instance, for the portrait of Louis XI de Bie relied on a painting he saw in Fontainebleau. In the rare cases where he was unable to find a portrait, either because there was no true likeness or because there was not reliable likeness, he left the portrait blank, as Hubert Goltzius had previously done. De Bie's collection of portraits was copied frequently over the next two centuries.Canova-Green, Marie-Claude, Du cabinet au livre d'histoire': les deux éditions de L'Histoire métallique de Jacques de Bie, in: Dix-septième siècle, 1/2011 (n° 250), p. 157-170 As late as the nineteenth century, de Bie's vrais portraits des rois de France were regarded as reliable sources of iconography. His portraits en medals served as models for real medals.Jacquiot, Josèphe, L'Académie royale des Inscriptions et Médailles et la suite des portraits des rois de France (1713), in: Comptes rendus des séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, Année 1972, Volume 116, Numéro 1, pp. 55-86 Curiosite d'amour from the Iconologie In 1636 de Bie published another book called La France métallique, contenant les actions célèbres tant publiques que privées des rois et des reines remarquées en leurs médailles d'or, d'argent & de bronze. Tirées des plus curieux cabinets. Au tres-chrestien roy de France et de Navarre Louis XIII ('Metallic France, containing the famous public and private actions of kings and queens noticed in their gold, silver & bronze medals. Taken from the most curious cabinets. To the very Christian king of France and Navarre Louis XIII'). He was either the writer or designer of the book. It consists mainly of imaginary coins depicting key events during the reigns of the Kings of France. While de Bie designed the medals, the idea for it clearly went back to the custom in various countries, including the Southern Netherlands and the Dutch Republic, of striking medals (jetons) to commemorate important events. One side of the jeton would bear the arms of the country or the portrait of its ruler, while its reverse would show an allegorical representation of the event. In the France métallique, de Bie did not copy real jetons but rather invented imaginary jetons representing the noble deeds of the French monarchs. De Bie's book proved to be very influential, opening the way for the Médailles sur les principaux événements du règne entier de Louis le Grand (Paris: Imprimerie Royale, 1723), a major achievement in its field. Jean Baudoin translated Cesare Ripa's Iconologia of 1593 into French and published it in Paris in 1636 under the title Iconologie. The Iconologia of Ripa was a highly influential emblem book based on Egyptian, Greek and Roman emblematical representations, many of them personifications.Maser, E.A. (1971) Cesare Ripa. Baroque and Rococo. Pictural Imagery. The 1758–1760 Hertel edition of Ripa's Iconologia with 200 engraved illustrations, p. viii–ix. The Hertel Edition For the French translation, de Bie translated the woodcuts from Ripa's original book into linear figures inside circular frames, thus turning Ripa's allegories into the reverse side of Roman coins. The preface to the second edition of 1644 of the Iconologie states that de Bie had died and that his plates had been retrieved from the pawnshop. This suggests that de Bie had again fallen on hard times and had to pawn the plates and had then died. There exists some doubt as to whether de Bie had actually died. A few books (including an illustrated one) published in Arnhem a few years later refer to a Jacob de Bie paying the expenses for printing it or designing it. It is therefore possible that de Bie left Paris for Arnhem where he continued his publishing activities. Work The principal achievements of de Bie are his ability to create systematic and clear publications on numismatics and his creativity in devising new ways to combine numismatics and history. His earliest known works are the prints he contributed to the Vita, passio et Resvrrectio Iesv Christi published by de Bie's master Adriaen Collaert in 1598. This was a series of prints depicting the life of Christ, based on illustrations by the Flemish painter and draughtsman Marten de Vos. Four other engravers produced engravings for this publication. Still, the 50 prints show a strong stylistic unity..Illustrated by Vos at the Southern Methodist University NotesExternal links * Category:Flemish engravers Category:Flemish printmakers Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:Flemish numismatists Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:16th-century engravers Category:17th-century engravers Category:Flemish publishers Category:1581 births Category:1640 deaths ","title":"Jacob de Bie"},{"id":"64265149","text":"Lyssach railway station () is a railway station in the municipality of Lyssach, in the Swiss canton of Bern.

Education and career Balogh grew up in Mórahalom and attended secondary school in Szeged at Ságvári Endre Gyakorló Gimnázium (a special school for mathematics). As a student, he won two silver medals (in 1989 and 1990) at the International Mathematical Olympiad. He studied at the University of Ghent and the University of Szeged, where he received his M.S, in mathematics in 1995 with advisor Péter Hajnal and thesis On the existence of MDS-cyclic codes. In 2001 Balogh received his doctorate from the University of Memphis with advisor Béla Bollobás and thesis Graph properties and Bootstrap percolation. As a postdoc Balogh was at AT&T; Shannon Laboratories in Florham Park, New Jersey and for several months in 2002 at the Institute for Advanced Study. From 2002 to 2005 he was Zassenhaus Assistant Professor at Ohio State University. At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign he was an assistant professor from 2005 to 2010 and an associate professor from 2010 to 2013 and is since 2013 a full professor. From 2009 to 2011 he was also an associate professor at University of California, San Diego. Balogh's research deals with extremal and probabilistic combinatorics (especially graph theory) and bootstrap percolation. The latter models the spread of an infection on a d-dimensional grid, whereby nodes are infected in each time step in which at least r neighbors have already been infected. It is based on a randomly chosen starting structure and Bollobás, Balogh, Hugo Duminil-Copin and Robert Morris proved an asymptotic (for large grids) formula for the threshold probability that the whole grid is infected, depending on d and r. He had previously treated the three-dimensional case with r = 3 with Bollobás and Morris. In 2018 Balogh was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro. In 2013/14 he was a Simons Fellow and Marie Curie Fellow and he received an NSF Career Grant. In 2016 he received the George Pólya Prize in combinatorics with Robert Morris and Wojciech Samotij.

On July 20, 2020, after being temporarily placed on administrative leave while the network conducted an investigation, ABC fired Fedida for racist and unprofessional conduct. Early life Fedida was born in Queens, New York and studied Journalism and Politics at New York University, graduating in 1988. She began her career at CBS as a broadcast assistant, first working on West 57th between 1988 and 1989. She then left the network to join ABC News where she continued (with spells elsewhere) through July of 2020. ABC News Fedida initially worked as a journalist at ABC reporting on the Gulf Wars, the September 11 attacks, and drug wars in South America. She became Vice President of Talent and Development in 2011, returning from time spent at CBS News.  Suspension  Tensions at ABC reportedly rose in 2016, after a letter was written to ABC News President James Goldston by journalists requesting reforms to improve the treatment of black candidates in hiring decisions. Fedida became aware of the letter and HuffPost sources described the subsequent meeting she attended with Goldston and the group as \\"tense\\". The company in February 2017 decided not to renew the contract of Mara Schiavocampo, one of the employees who had raised the issue with management. She was reportedly not informed of the decision at the time, and was only notified in July 2017 at which point she was also taken off the air for the remainder of her contract through to 2018. She reportedly accused Fedida of \\"racial discrimination\\", but later agreed to a financial settlement including \\"a nondisclosure and non disparagement agreement.\\" In 2018, when Robin Roberts of Good Morning America sought out a pay increase for her work on the show. A source states that \\"Fedida then asked what more Roberts could want and said it wasn't as if the network was asking Roberts to 'pick cotton.'\\" On June 11, 2020, Black journalists again expressed frustration with Goldston and Fedida about the network's coverage of the death of George Floyd, as well as the treatment of black candidates in hiring decisions. In 2020 Goldston placed Fedida on \\"administrative leave\\" after a HuffPost report which alleged an \\"extensive history\\" of \\"insensitive and racist remarks.\\" She was reportedly serving as \\"a deputy\\" to Goldston in her role which was continued from the previous leadership of Ben Sherwood. She was reportedly \\"tasked with being an enforcer\\" to take on \\"all of the difficult issues he doesn’t want to handle.\\" She had reportedly had a \\"long pattern of insensitive statements, including racist comments\\" and was subject to many HR complaints including an investigation in 2016; staffers reportedly were \\"stunned\\" when that did not lead to Fedida's dismissal. In response to her June 2020 suspension Fedida released a statement through her attorney describing the accusations as \\"heartbreaking and incredibly misleading\\" On July 20, 2020, Walt Disney Co.announced that due to Fedida's numerous racially insensitive remarks, her employment at ABC News had ended.

As of 2020, the market provides more than 90% of Beijing's fruits and vegetables according to state media. Seafood and meat are also sold at the market. Vendors distribute produce from Xinfadi to many smaller markets in Beijing. It is nicknamed the \\"vegetable basket\\" and \\"fruit bowl\\" of the city. Xinfadi Market opened on May 16, 1988. It has been renovated at least once in its lifetime. In 2017, it covered an area of 112 hectares. It is the largest wholesale food market in Beijing, with three floors above ground and two underground in 2018. Representatives claim it to be the largest wholesale food market in Asia, with as of 2020 more than 10,000 workers including 1,500 managers and over 4,000 tenants. According to the official site in 2020, more than 20,000 tons of fruit, 18,000 tons of vegetables, and 1,500 tons of seafood are sold at the market each day. There is a \\"beef and lamb trading hall\\", and poultry meat is also sold on the premises. \\"The Xinfadi Market is more of a one-stop-shop where wholesalers in the city would purchase vegetables, meat and seafood hall after hall.” The market was responsible in 2016 for 70% of Beijing's fresh vegetables, more than 80% of Beijing's fresh food and drinks, and all of the city's imported fruit. Every year, 14 million tons of products are sold at the market for an estimated 50 billion RMB. History In the last years of the 20th century, Beijing was home to four major food markets: Xinfadi, Yuegezhuang Market (1986), Dazhongsi Market (1986) and Sidaokou Market. Tongxian County latterly set up a market as part of a \\"new national network of Central wholesale markets\\", after the 1985 liberalization of trade. Background and establishment Xinfadi Village, where the market is located, was originally named \\"Xinfendi\\" (, literally \\"new grave land\\"), because in 1958 a graveyard located there was leveled to create farmland. The area gradually turned into a settlement, and the name was changed to \\"Xinfadi\\" (roughly \\"newly developed land\\"). The village mainly contains sandy, loamy, brown soil, suitable for planting vegetables. On May 10, 1985, the Beijing Bureau of Commodity Prices decided to relax control of the prices of seven key agricultural products: pork, beef, mutton, eggs, poultry, marine fish, and vegetables. On May 30, the municipal Party committee and city government convened a vegetable work conference and decided to \\"revitalize buying and selling\\" and \\"allow food from other parts of the country to come into Beijing\\". As a result, after farmers from near Xinfadi Village handed over the required quantity of vegetables to the government, they began to set up roadside stands to sell the remainder. These stands gradually turned into a street market. Over time, many farmers from outside Beijing joined the street market, resulting in disorganized commerce and traffic jams. Local officials repeatedly tried to drive them out, without success, so a member of the Fengtai District Bureau of Industry and Commerce recommended that a wholesale market be established in the village, welcoming the farmers instead of trying to remove them. Xinfadi Village Vegetable Company manager Zhang Yuxi () decided to build a market. lang=zh On May 16, 1988, 15 villagers, led by Zhang, used wire netting to enclose one hectare in Xinfadi Village. They used 150,000 yuan of funding (50,000 each from the district, township, and village) to establish a farmers' market. In the early days of the market, Zhang, who lacked experience setting up a marketplace, personally sold vegetables in Jining, Zhangjiakou, Luohe, and other places. Growth By 1989, the area used by Xinfadi Market grew to 1.7 hectares; in 1992, it grew to nearly 7 ha; and in 1999, it grew to close to 70 ha. During this continual growth, Xinfadi Market used low fees and simple procedures to attract customers, and on holidays they did not charge administrative fees. The number of transactions gradually grew, and in 1996 the market's vegetable sales exceeded 1.1 billion kilograms, representing 40% of vegetable sales in Beijing. The market's scope also expanded to include eight categories: vegetables, fruits, grains, oil, meat, seafood, eggs, and condiments. In 2003 the market accounted for 60% of Beijing's vegetable trade. In 2003, Xinfadi Village established 19 residential buildings, dubbed \\"Xinfadi Executive Paradise\\" (), to provide housing for managers at Xinfadi Market who were from other places. In 2004, non-market businesses started to move in. In 2006, 50 individual butcher stallholders sold roughly 200 kilograms of meat each per day. An independent observer said that he saw health inspection certifications on both the stalls and the displayed carcasses. In 2010, Xinfadi Market occupied 100 hectares, with transactions worth 36 billion RMB. As of 2016, the market covered 121 hectares (230 hectares including the \\"service area\\" with hotels, restaurants, and other establishments that serve the market). The 2017 renovation plan, which was budgeted for $220 million, planned for the market's area to be reduced to 68 hectares. COVID-19 outbreak Lockdown near Xinfadi market, 13 June 2020 On June 13, 2020 at 03:00, the public health authority temporarily closed the Xinfadi market due to a COVID-19 outbreak. A \\"wartime mechanism\\" was put in place. Beijing CCP Party Secretary Cai Qi, city leaders Zhang Yankun, Du Feijin, Chen Yong, Wei Xiaodong, Cui Shuqiang, Wang Ning, Lu Yan, Yang Jinbai, Qi Yanjun, and secretary general of the municipal government Jin Wei participated in this decision. Mass popular testing at the market in week 20 \\"detected more than 50 new infections\\". Tourism to the capital has been curtailed as a result, as well as sporting events. Cai said on 13 June that \\"We must ponder our pains, draw lessons from it, and always tighten the string of epidemic prevention and control.\\" The authorities, who had been urged by the CCP \\"to act decisively\\", had found over the previous two days \\"confirmed cases and positive infections via nucleic acid testing for two consecutive days\\" as of the morning of 13 June. Analysis from 40 environmental samples also tested positive for COVID-19. It was reported that workers in the market and local residents were required to undergo PCR testing. People who had been to the market since 30 May must receive COVID-19 tests. During the weekend of 13 June, soldiers were seen in full uniform trooping in lock step to control the marketplace. Eleven neighbourhoods near the market were put under lockdown to control the outbreak. Officials announced that they would arrange temporary stands to sell fruits and vegetables, so that produce would still be available in Beijing while the market was closed. On 15 June, 27 new cases were reported in Beijing, bringing the city's total to 106 since the previous Friday. Lockdowns were declared in residential communities surrounding the market. Authorities barred residents of high-risk areas from leaving Beijing. Taxi services were barred from bringing Beijing residents out of the city. On 16 June, the government closed all schools in Beijing, as Cai described as \\"extremely grave\\". On 17 June, government cancelled 1,000 airplane flights, although the Civil Aviation Administration of China had yet to declare public notice. On 19 June an official said that \\"the majority of samples collected from the aquatic and soybean product areas at the market have tested positive for COVID19\\". As of 20 June, the authorities had sealed off 40 communities in Beijing, and told residents \\"not to leave their homes to avoid cross infection\\". Dayanglu Market halted its retail business on 21 June. There are 3,061 vendors in Dayanglu, \\"whose meat, poultry and egg transactions account 50% of the city's total.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Bazaars Category:Wholesale markets in China Category:Food markets in China Category:Buildings and structures in Fengtai District Category:COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China Category:Retail markets in China ","title":"Xinfadi Market"},{"id":"64265341","text":"BreakTudo is a Brazilian music, television and internet news portal.

Biography  Robert earned her undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Sherbrooke (1984), and her masters and doctorate in astrophysics, University of Montreal (1987, 1992 respectively). She also completed postdoctoral fellowships including one with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland (1991-1994). Canada-France-Hawaii Astronomical Observatory, located at the top of Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii. (Credit NASA) As a graduate student, Robert investigated the wind clumps observed in the spectrum of the Cygnus Wolf-Rayet stars, using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. As a postdoc at the Space Telescope Science Institute, she applied this expertise on massive stars to study starburst regions in distant galaxies in the ultraviolet light. In 1995 she received a Women Faculty Award from the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada enabling her to return to Université Laval in Quebec. One of her grad students there was Laurie Rousseau-Nepton, the first indigenous woman in Quebec to obtain a Ph.D. in astrophysics. For the academic year ending April 2018, she took a leave of absence to conduct research at the University of Hawaii, Hilo from September 2017 to April 2018.  Research  Robert's research includes the characterization of the different generations of stars in galaxies and uses that information to understand the mechanisms that drive the evolution of galaxies. One of her key focus areas is known as a starburst region. According to one report, > \\"The peculiarity of the spectral signatures collected by Anne Pellerin and > Carmelle Robert is due to the fact that they cover a light not visible to > the naked eye, the distant ultraviolet, \\"a light associated with events of > very high energy,\\" specifies the student-researcher.

Working with colleagues Laurent Drissen, Yvan Dutil and Jean-René Roy, the discovery was made at the Canada- France-Hawaii Astronomical Observatory, located at the top of Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii. A paper about the event said, \\"SN1996D appeared suddenly following the explosion of a star whose mass would be about ten times that of the Sun.\\" The supernova is not readily visible to the naked eye but using a quality telescope, amateur observers could expect to see it in dark skies.

It was formally established in 1928 by Krishna Menon and was the most influential and successful organisation in Britain during the 1930s and 1940s to fight against British imperialism. In the early years, the India League was supported by stalwarts such as Bertrand Russell, Michael Foot, and Jawaharlal Nehru; Russell and Foot both went on the chair the League. Nehru, being very close friends with Menon, supported the League throughout. The League was revived in 2020 and its new objectives include being a think-tank which examines the views/needs of Indians in the UK.  Related foundations  In the 1910s, the \\"Home Rule Movement\\" was started in India by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Its objective was to push for the self-governance for India. In 1916, Annie Besant started a separate yet similar organisation and modelled it on the Irish freedom movement—\\"Home Rule for India League\\". This in 1922 morphed into the \\"Commonwealth of India League\\" and had the objective of lobbying British MPs for self governance whilst remaining within the Empire.  Freedom struggle  In 1928, Krishna Menon took control of the organisation and formalised it into the famous \\"India League\\". Menon was a charismatic, well-connected, and eloquent. This allowed him to flourish in elite British left-wing circles where he influenced several top intellectuals, subsequently, involving them with the league. Additionally, breaking with past conventions, the League now demanded full independence for India. As the 1930s progressed, a few other UK based groups had this objective. As the League was the most powerful and influential, it often acted as the co-coordinating force. The League was effective at educating the British public about the atrocities of colonial rule and the hypocrisies of the Empire. It did this by organising public meetings, distributing pamphlets, and engaging with media/policy-makers. They formed alliances with organisations such as women's groups, workers organisations, anti-imperialists, and anti-capitalists. The League documented and then provided robust information to ‘influencers’ and often won the moral case for independence. The League would regularly host events where the intellectual heavy-weights of British society would be present and engaged. Those involved with the League include: Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Michael Foot, Bertrand Russell, Stafford Cripps, Aneurin Bevan, Ellen Wilkinson, Harold Laski, and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.  Affiliations with other Indian groups  The League's members were mostly British elites and wealthy Indian students and apprentices. However, as more working-class Indians came to Britain in the 1930s, a new organisation was formalised. In Coventry 1939, the Indian Workers Association (IWA) was born and became affiliated with the League. Many members of such groups were watched by Scotland Yard as their revolutionary activities ran contrary to the interests of imperial Britain. The original IWA partook in street marches and highlighted India's plight to the sympathetic British working-class. In the UK, the League was affiliated to the Labour Party and the Communist Party. In India, the League worked very close to the Indian National Congress due to the friendship of Krishna Menon and soon-to-be prime minister, Nehru. In 1951, the League created the India Club as an official meeting venue, the club is now independent of the League and based in the Strand, London.  Post India's independence  Post India's independence and partition, the League stayed affiliated to the aforementioned groups, but its role changed. The League became an organisation to promote a cross-cultural understanding of India and the UK, in addition to, helping new Indian migrants settle into British life. The League had chapters across the UK who would put on cultural events and engaged with local politics. During the 1960s/1970s, the League would partake in anti-racism activism and fought to ensure social cohesion between native and migrant populations. A former League President, Ujagar Singh Rurka (the grandfather of Baroness Verma), was even invited to a Royal Garden Party. Other notable members of the League include Lord Desai and its former Chair, V P Hansrani.  Decline and renewal  As many new organisations came about in the 1980s onward, the League's unique place in society was no longer apparent. As many of its founding members had died and with no one to carry the baton, the League slowly began to lose relevance as its various leaders struggled to adapt it to a changing world. However, the League has continued on with minor activities. Such activities included tending the Gandhi statue in Tavistock Square, London. In 2020, the League was repurposed as a progressive platform for contextualising Indian ideas in the modern era, in addition to, a body which represents the views of British Indians. The League's first project is in conjunction with the University of Oxford and they are writing a seminal report on Indians in the UK. This report will be launched in Parliament and will touch on issues ranging from, Health to Representation to Political Priorities.

It is currently located at 30 Murray Street in Ottawa's central ByWard Market neighborhood, roughly between the U.S. and Danish embassies. History The Philippine Embassy in Ottawa was opened on March 1, 1971, with Privado G. Jimenez becoming the first resident Philippine ambassador to Canada. Notably, the Embassy is not the first Philippine diplomatic mission in Canada; the Philippine Consulate General in Vancouver is older, dating back to 1956. Several diplomats posted to the Embassy were recalled in May 2019 by Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., ostensibly to pressure the Canadian government to take action in resolving the Canada–Philippines waste dispute, where several garbage-laden shipping containers were shipped to the Philippines from Canada and had been a sticking point in relations between the two countries for a number of years. The dispute was finally resolved around two weeks later with Canada taking back the containers, and the diplomats were promptly dispatched back to Ottawa by the DFA to resume their posts. Chancery Since July 1, 2016, the Philippine Embassy in Ottawa has been based out of a standalone building at 30 Murray Street, relocating from its previous chancery in the Varette Building at 130 Albert Street in downtown Ottawa, which it had moved into in 2011. The property, previously called the Collectiv Building, was acquired by the Philippine government for this purpose on January 15, 2016. The current chancery, a three-story structure, previously housed the studios and offices for radio station CJLL-FM, with the Embassy relocating to the building out of the need for more space to conduct its future activities. Consular offices are located on the first floor, while the chancery proper is located on the second floor. The third floor houses event space for the Embassy, as well as the Ottawa center of the Sentro Rizal — the first in Canada — which opened on May 10, 2018. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Ottawa is currently headed by Ambassador Petronila P. Garcia, who was appointed to the position by President Benigno Aquino III on January 24, 2014. Prior to becoming Ambassador, Garcia, a career diplomat, served as Assistant Secretary at the Department of Foreign Affairs Office of Middle East and African Affairs, and prior to that was deployed to the Philippine Embassy in Tel Aviv as the ambassador to Israel. Her appointment was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on March 12, 2014. Notable diplomats deployed to the Embassy include Francisco Noel Fernandez, who topped the 1994 Philippine Bar Examination and was appointed as its Deputy Chief of Mission in September 2016, and Buenaflor Cruz, who while serving at the Embassy was charged in 2014 with human trafficking involving the exploitation of a 26-year-old Filipino woman who was hired as a nanny. Serving over 800,000 Filipino Canadians, many of the Embassy's activities center around fostering continuing relations between Filipinos in Canada and their home country. In 2014, it organized the first annual Winter Escapade, where Filipino Canadians are brought to the Philippines for a week-long tour of the country during the winter months. Organized in cooperation with the other Philippine diplomatic missions in Canada, as well as other government agencies, the first tour generated over C$1 million in economic output, with 60-65 percent of participants taking the trip more than once. It also organizes events in cooperation with the local Filipino community, such as an annual series of Christmas events and contests, and cultural exhibits at the Sentro Rizal. The Embassy exercises consular jurisdiction over eastern Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, where it services nearly 53,000 Filipinos, more than half of whom are in Quebec.

They lived between the Eocene lower/middle and the Oligocene lower (about 48 - 30 million years ago) and their remains were found in Europe and Africa. Description These animals had the classic archaic appearance of primitive artiodactyls, with an unspecialized body and relatively small size. However, since the middle Eocene, cheropotamides began to develop some characteristics that will be found, more accentuated, in the suiforms: bunodonti molars (low and wide crown) and short legs. Fossils rather complete with shapes such as Amphirhagatherium indicate that these animals still had a relatively elongated tail, slender but shorter legs than those of other archaic artiodactyls, an elongated and flexible body, and a long snout. The length of these animals should not exceed the meter, and the weight was around 5 - 10 kilograms. Classification Cheropotamides are mainly known in numerous European Eocene deposits, and only a few fossils of dubious identity have been found in Egypt and Turkey. Cheropotamides are clearly derived from primitive forms of artiodactyls such as Diacodexis, and yet they already show some specializations that recall the suiforms, although they are not their direct ancestors. Among the various genres belonging to this family are Haplobunodon, Masillabune, Choeropotamus, Tapirulus, Amphirhagatherium and Rhagatherium.

History Chaolin Temple traces its history to the 1850s, when a farmer surnamed Chen sought to donate his land and construct a temple to Nezha. A feng shui practitioner advised against the temple's construction, and it was not built in Chen's lifetime. After the feng shui practitioner had also died, Nezha began appearing to Chen's descendants, warning of heavy rains if the temple was not constructed soon. The rains that came caused flooding, and the floods washed the coffin of the feng shui practitioner into a pond. The coffin circled the pond three times, then sank and vanished. A second origin story also involves floodwaters, in this case diverted by an apparition of a child, which saved the village. Afterwards, local leaders collected funds to construct a temple, and the Chen family donated land for its construction. Following the flood, Chaolin Temple was completed in 1909. However, during Japanese rule, Chinese folk religion was repressed. When the Kuomintang-led government required temples to be placed on a registry in 1973, township leader Chen Jung-chieh submitted Chaolin Temple under a neighboring address. A community and elder care program that had launched in 2006 is hosted at Chaolin Temple. Chaolin Temple was designated a historical site by the Pingtung County Government in 2006.

It is one of England's oldest choral foundations and is the oldest of its kind in Oxford and Cambridge, predating its sister college in Cambridge by more than sixty years. Consisting of approximately 16 boys and 14 men, it is one of the main choral foundations of the University of Oxford and is regarded as one of the leading choirs of the world. Under Edward Higginbottom, the choir was characterised by a robust sound that allowed individual voices to be heard, and has two Gramophone Awards to its name. Membership The choir is made up of choristers aged eight to thirteen who attend New College School, undergraduates (known as academical clerks) from the age of 18 who study at the college, and lay clerks - older, professional singers. The choir sings in the usual collegiate format of Decani and Cantoris, with seven men on either side. Historically, the gentlemen of the choir were solely lay clerks. It was only in the 1960s that the choir admitted its first undergraduate member - the young countertenor, James Bowman. Recordings Under the directorship of Edward Higginbottom, the choir rose to particular prominence in the 1990s with their platinum best-selling and award-winning Agnus Dei disc which includes Allegri's famous Miserere mei. The choir's discography rapidly grew under Higginbottom and now totals over 110 discs. A new chapter in the choir's recording life began in 2010 with the launch of its own label, Novum. Recordings represent a of music from the core of the English choral tradition (Howells, Stanford, Wesley, Blow, Britten, Ludford, Tomkins, Boyce, Croft, Taverner, Tye, Locke, Handel, Gibbons, Tallis and Byrd). Further projects include Bach's St John Passion and Motets, Monteverdi's Vespers, Haydn's Creation, as well as recordings of the music of Poulenc, MacMillan, Copland and the music of their contemporaries. Reflecting the interests of Edward Higginbottom, the choir has made important contributions to the performance and recording of French baroque music - in particular the music of Du Caurroy, Charpentier, Delalande, and Couperin. New College Choir have also made numerous recordings of continental polyphony including Lassus, Palestrina, and de Monte. In 2008, the choir won its second Gramophone Award in the early music category for their recording of Nicholas Ludford's Missa Benedicta. Tours The choir began touring overseas in the 1960s under David Lumsden, who recognised the benefits it would bring to the choir as well as the reputation of the college. To compliment their considerable recording activity, New College Choir established a busy schedule of concerts and international touring taking the choir to countries as far afield as America, Australia, Japan, and Brazil. European tours have been a mainstay of the choir's international activity, with particular emphasis on France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. On 29 June 2015 and 2016, at the invitation of the Holy See and the Cappella Musicale Pontificia Sistina, the choir sang at the Papal Pallium mass for the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul in St. Peter's Basilica. Recent sabbaticals have allowed the choir to benefit from the musical direction of Paul Brough and Dr James Lancelot.

Early life and education  Cecilia Afran Gaisie was born in Assin Nsuta, Gold Coast (now Ghana) in 1936 to Philip Afran Gaisie, a businessman, and Mary Adwoa Kwansaa Boafo, a housewife and one of Cecilia's father's six wives. She belonged to the Royal Asenie family of Adansi Medoma. Cecilia attended primary school at the Roman Catholic School at Assin Anyinabrim, and at the Assin Edubiase Methodist School, near Assin Nsuta. She then went to secondary school in nearby Cape Coast, first attending middle school at Our Lady of Apostles (OLA) College of Education and then completing her secondary education at Holy Child High School. In 1959, Cecilia moved to the United Kingdom where she studied LLB law at the University of Hull. She was called to the bar at Lincoln’s Inn in London in 1963.  Career  After completing her tertiary education in the UK, Cecilia returned to Ghana in 1964 and began working as a lawyer in the private legal practice of Opoku Acheampong and Company. She was eventually recruited as a magistrate by the Ghanaian Judicial Service. After working for several years as a judge in Ghana’s district court and circuit court, Cecilia was appointed as a High Court judge in 1975, a position which she held until her death in 1982. In 1980, Cecilia ruled in favour of a businessman named Mr Shackleford, who had been detained during the 1979 revolution led by Jerry Rawlings. Cecilia held that there was no justification for the detention and directed his release. Cecilia was the first judge to have questioned the transitional provisions of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) inserted in the 1979 constitution and she set free an AFRC convict. She also decided a case involving the rioting workers of Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation (GIHOC) who attacked parliament in Ghana's Third Republic. Joachim Amartey Quaye, one of the leaders of the rioting workers, subsequently became a member of Rawlings’ Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC), which was the ruling party at the time of Cecilia's murder in 1982. Amartey Quaye was later tried and convicted of his role in Cecilia's murder.  Personal life  Cecilia's first husband was Nicholas Liverpool, who went on to serve as the sixth president of Dominica from 2003 to 2012. Cecilia and Nicholas met during their studies at the University of Hull and married in 1963. They had four children together. In 1969, they divorced, and in 1974, Cecilia married Gustav Koranteng-Addow, a judge who served as Attorney General of Ghana from 1975 to 1979. Cecilia and Gustav met through work and remained married until Cecilia’s death in 1982. They had no children together.  Death and legacy  Cecilia was abducted and murdered in secret on 30 June 1982, along with two other Supreme Court justices, Frederick Poku Sarkodie and Kwadjo Adgyei Agyepong, and a retired army officer, Sam Acquah, during the second military rule of Rawlings. Rawlings had ousted President Hilla Limann in a coup d’etat on 31 December 1981. The murders took place at the Bundase military shooting range in the Accra Plains during the hours of a night time curfew. Their charred bodies were discovered in the same location the following day. Following intense pressure on Rawlings and the PNDC, a Special Investigation Board was formed by the government to investigate the murders. In 1992, The Independent reported findings of the Special Investigation Board's inquiry in Ghana, which it said had recommended the prosecution of 10 people for the murders, including Ghana's head of national security at the time Kojo Tsikata. Tsikata, who was Rawlings’ right hand man, filed a defamation lawsuit against The Independent on 26 March 1993, which he agreed to drop after The Independent published a correction statement in September 1998, in which they clarified that they had not intended to suggest that Tsikata was guilty of the crimes. Lance Corporal Amedeka, Michael Senyah, Tekpor Hekli, Johnny Dzandu and Joachim Amartey Quaye were indicted for the murders in 1993. In June 1993, before the trial could be completed, Amedeka escaped from the Nsawam and Ussher Fort prisons where they were being held and left Ghana. Senya, Hekli, Dzandu and Amartey Quaye were found guilty of murder, sentenced to death and executed by firing squad. Cecilia and the other two murdered justices are remembered in an annual judicial service on the anniversary of their deaths, called Martyrs Day, in Ghana. The Memorial to the Martyrs of the Rule of Law, which includes statues of all three murdered justices, stands in front of the Supreme Court of Ghana buildings today. The Esi Afran Foundation was founded in Cecilia’s memory in 2011, by her childhood friend Josephine van Lare and two of her children, Philip Liverpool and Nana Ama Brantuo (née Liverpool), with the goal of improving the lives of young women through education and training. The foundation currently works to improve the standard of education in Ghana by providing financial support and advice to other organisations that focus on education.

The seminary is subject to the authority of the Lombard Episcopal Conference and as a Roman ecclesiastical institute it also has a particular dependence on the Holy See. While many of the students originate in the dioceses of Lombardy, the seminary accepts priests from other dioceses, both Italian and not. History The seminary was founded by the bishops of Lombardy in 1854. It was initially funded by Cardinal Edoardo Borromeo and Duke Tommaso Gallarati Scotti (1819–1905), though insufficient resources forced it to close from 1869 to 1878. It first shared quarters with the Confraternity of San Carlo al Corso and in 1888 opened its own residence on in Via Giuseppe Gioachino Belli in the Prati del Castello district. Pope Leo XIII gave the Seminary its legal character on 15 December 1890, recognizing it in the same terms as the other Roman seminaries and granting it the use of the title \\"Pontifical\\". Its current building overlooks the square in front of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in the Esquilino district of Rome. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini laid its cornerstone on 10 February 1963 and returned to inaugurate the building as Pope Paul VI on 11 November 1965. The building is considered one of the most significant modern buildings in the historic center of Rome. It was designed by the architects Attilio Spaccarelli and Fabrizio Bruno, \\"characterized by great attention to the urban context\\".

Quasibarrelled spaces are studied because they are a weakening of the defining condition of barrelled spaces, for which a form of the Banach–Steinhaus theorem holds.  Definition  A subset B of a TVS X is called bornivorous if it absorbs all bounded subsets of X; that is, if for each bounded subset S of X, there exists some scalar r such that S ⊆ rB. A barrelled set or a barrel in a TVS is a set which is convex, balanced, absorbing and closed. A quasibarrelled space is a TVS for which every bornivorous barrelled set in the space is a neighbourhood of the origin.  Properties  A locally convex Hausdorff quasibarrelled space that is sequentially complete is barrelled. A locally convex Hausdorff quasibarrelled space is a Mackey space, quasi-M-barrelled, and countably quasibarrelled. A locally convex space is reflexive if and only if it is semireflexive and quasibarrelled. A locally convex quasi-barreled space that is also a 𝜎-barrelled space is a barrelled space.  Characterizations  A Hausdorff TVS is quasibarrelled if and only if every bounded closed linear operator from into a complete metrizable TVS is continuous. * Recall that a linear operator is called closed if its graph is a closed subset of . For a locally convex space X with continuous dual X^{\\\\prime} the following are equivalent: * X is quasi-barrelled, * every bounded lower semi-continuous semi-norm on X is continuous, * every \\\\beta(X', X)-bounded subset of the continuous dual space X' is equicontinuous. If X is a metrizable locally convex TVS then the following are equivalent: 1. The strong dual of X is quasibarrelled. 2. The strong dual of X is barrelled. 3. The strong dual of X is bornological.  Examples and sufficient conditions  Every Hausdorff barrelled space and every Hausdorff bornological space is quasibarrelled. Thus, every metrizable TVS is quasibarrelled. Note that there exist quasibarrelled spaces that are neither barrelled nor bornological. There exist Mackey spaces that are not quasibarrelled.

Early life and education Lott was born in Simmesport, Louisiana in 1943. He is African American. During the 1950s, his family relocated to Texas, eventually settling in Houston's Fifth Ward. He attended E.O. Smith Elementary School and Kashmere Gardens High School. In 1957, at the age of 14, he sold his first artwork, a painting. Lott has said this event marked the beginning of his professional art career. At the time, people of color were only allowed to visit Houston's Fine Arts Museum on one specified day each week. Galleries, too, generally prohibited viewings. The exhibition of black artists' work was virtually unheard of. Muralist John Biggers was an early mentor. Biggers was founding chairman of the art department at Texas Southern University (formerly Texas State University for Negroes). Following a trip to Africa, he visited area high schools, including Lott's, and expounded on art, specifically the role of the black artist. Biggers taught that African American artists should turn to the mother country rather than Europe for inspirational models. On Biggers recommendation, Lott enrolled in the historically black college Hampton Institute. He studied there during 1963 and 1964. From Virginia, he moved across the country to California State University (1965) and then Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. During his time at Otis, 1967 to 1969, social realist Charles White was his drawing teacher and personal advisor. Lott fell in with the Black Arts Movement, a group of conceptual artists and collagists that included White, David Hammons and Joe Overstreet. While Lott was skilled at painting and drawing, he soon discovered his true gift, turning trash to treasure and combining it with the spirit of activism. In Collision: The Contemporary Art Scene in Houston, 1972–1985, author Pete Gershon writes, \\"Very much in line with the Black Arts Movement, Lott's work involved a kind of community-building social practice. It was common for him to hire a pack of loitering kids to dismantle a castoff bedspring and sort out its components. As Lott says, 'There's one kid that didn't become a juvenile delinquent that day...'\\" Career In 1974, Lott returned to the Fifth Ward. In the summer of 1977, Robinson Galleries held a major exhibition of his work, Relics of the Future, the first large solo show for Lott. It included 40 works, including 14 sculptures, 5 paintings and a 30-minute video tape by Andy Mann that documented the original installation and opening. The gallery also produced a 19-page catalog that accompanied the exhibit. Robinson Galleries presented Relics of the Future, Part Two the following year. In 1979, Lott's 9-foot, 200-pound figurative wire and rebar sculpture Zoroastera: Fire Spitter was included in Fire, a show of 100 Texas artists curated by James Surls for the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston. At Surls' invitation Art in America editor Lucy Lippard covered the exhibit for the international magazine. Her review was measured, but would be instrumental in bringing nationwide attention to Texas artists. Dozens of solo exhibits and group shows, often surveys of African American artists, would follow. While some black artists bristle at being labeled, Lott sees it as an opportunity to recognize a racially divided country. Large touring exhibits that focused on black artists and featured Lott include Next Generation: Southern Black Aesthetics (1990-1992) and Stop Asking, We Exist: 25 African American Crafts Artists (1998-2000). A solo exhibit Jesse Lott: Urban Frontier Artist visited the Museum of Contemporary Art in Washington D.C. and the Art Car Museum in Houston. His work has also been shown at The Studio Museum in Harlem and The Alternative Museum (now closed) in Lower Manhattan. On the role of the artist, Lott states, \\"Artists are entrusted with a metaphysical vision. It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. That means that many words have been entrusted to those to whom God has given the ability to create. When a pebble hits a pool, it starts a wave that covers the whole pool. The pebble is the concept. An artist puts out a concept and the concept changes the consciousness of the viewer, leading to a positive change in the pattern of his activity.\\" In addition to his visionary artwork, Lott's shaman-like presence in Houston's art community has had widespread impact. Many Texas artists including Rick Lowe, James Surls, Bert Long, Jr., Robert Pruitt, Angelbert Metoyer and Robert Hodge name Lott as an important influence. In the catalog for Jesse Lott: Urban Frontier Artist (1999), longtime friend and supporter Jim Harithas wrote, \\"He is respected for the integrity and mojo power of his art and greatly admired for his many private acts of compassion to the homeless, to poverty-stricken seniors, to the young and to artists throughout the community. His all-ages workshops that he has held over the years in his studio as a community service have inspired many students who would otherwise have no exposure to art.\\" Lott has also been involved in other \\"significant community activities including Adept, the first museum devoted to African American culture in Houston [now closed], The Midtown Art Center, the Ann Robinson Gallery and the Art Car Museum. Lott's community oriented philosophy and his Artists in Action program helped spark the creation of the now famous Project Row Houses.\\" Urban Frontier Art In the catalog for his first exhibit at Robinson Galleries, Lott outlined the tenets of his art making process, which he referred to at the time as \\"urban folk art\\". \\"The concept of urban folk art is based on four universal principles which are to me: *1. the law of existence: all things that exist are the best possible evidence of themselves *2. the law of opposition: all things that exist, exist in terms of their opposite *3. the principle of activity: the end result of all processes is simply activity and the awareness of that activity *4. the principle of order: the basic order existing in the universe (biological, geometric, cosmic, etc. When these principles are added to the urban artist's approach, the result is a sculptural technique which is directly related to their environment. The sculptural technique, represented here, is a combination of the natural resources of the urban community along with the skill of a trained artist and the attitude of the primitive.\\" Found Materials A distinctive feature of the Lott's work is the use of found materials. He realized early on that the cost of art materials was prohibitive, not only for him, but also for all artists of limited means. At the same time, he saw that in a commodity-driven culture, a wealth of materials, in the form of discards, is available to any artist for the taking. Lott employs these urban castoffs: wire, broken glass, tree roots and branches, scraps of costume jewelry, furniture legs, metal bed frames and springs, and discarded paper in his sculptural work. \\"It's political,\\" Lott has said about this artmaking process, \\"Transforming trash into a classical figure is a political action. Rich people don't have time to go through the garbage - their job is to make the garbage. But when a mother of two has to buy cereal boxes for her kids, and she transforms those cereal boxes into paper dolls and sells them, she is entering a different economic system. Art is political when you use it to solve economic problems.\\" El Piñatero Method Another low cost technique Lott uses for sculpting is known as El Piñatero Method because of its similarity to piñata making as layers of papier mâché are applied over frameworks (sometimes combined with discarded, reclaimed objects) to create human, animal and other forms. Instead of wire armatures, he begins with a paper or cardboard cone for the primary structure. Additional cones are used to form the limbs, then more paper of all types and colors are layered on top to build the figures, which range from 3 inches to 10 feet tall. Project Row Houses Project Row Houses studios Lott was pivotal in the founding of Project Row Houses (PRH), a landmark urban reclamation project located in Houston's Third Ward. In 1993, a coalition of black artists led by Rick Lowe and including James Bettison, Bert Long, Floyd Newsum, Bert Samples and George Smith raised the funds to purchase 22 derelict shotgun houses built in the 1930s. Seven of the buildings were transformed into a center for contemporary African American art that hosts changing exhibitions and performances. Five of the houses are used as residences for single mothers and their children. One serves as PRH's office and as a community gathering place. The project's five pillars of social art practice are: art and creativity, education, social safety net, good and relevant architecture, and economic sustainability. An exhibit on Project Row Houses is on permanent display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. Art League Houston Lifetime Achievement Award In 2016, Art League Houston named Lott the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award in Visual Arts. The accompanying exhibition featured a detailed survey of more than 30 pieces: sculpture, drawing and collage, highlighting the three key materials in Lott's work: paper, wire and wood. The work was drawn from art historical, political and personal perspectives, and evidenced Lott's profound engagement with the creative process and his commitment to the value of lifelong learning and community building. The show also referenced Lott's significant influence as both teacher and mentor by including work by longtime students and co-collaborators. While the Art League show ran, Lott also had work up at three other venues: Friendly Fire at the Station Museum of Contemporary Art, From Space To Field at the SITE Gallery, and at another location as part of Houston Sculpture Month. Jesse Lott: Art and Activism Lott is the subject of a 28-minute documentary Jesse Lott: Art & Activism released in 2017. The short was shot by students from the 14 Pews Film Academy and directed and edited by 14 Pews founder Cressandra Thibodeaux. The video has won numerous national awards, including Best Short Documentary in both the International Black Film Festival and the Tulsa American Film Festival. The piece follows Lott from an unexpected hospital stay, through his preparation for the 2016 Art League exhibit to the show's opening at which he received the lifetime achievement award from longtime friend, artist Mel Chin. Houston art community notables that sat for interviews include Rick Lowe, Jim and Ann Harithas, Allison Greene, Dan Allison and Pete Gershon. The documentary also contains previously unseen archival footage shot by the late video artist Andy Mann.

In 2013, he was one of twenty-two artists commissioned to create sculpture for METRORail's Arts in Transit program. Constructed from stainless steel and mixed metals, Lott's piece depicts a figure with its arms in the air. It was originally titled The Spirit of Transport, but was renamed Hands Up, Don't Shoot! by the community. It is installed on METRORail's Purple Line at Scott St. and Elgin St. in the Third Ward. The same year, he was invited to participate in the Texan-French Alliance for the Arts citywide \\"Open-The-Door\\" public art project, for which he created a tribute painting to Houston artist Bert Long. In 2010, he was commissioned by Hermann Park to make a public art piece for Lake Plaza where he integrated art objects and materials found around the city into the plaza's walkways. Personal life Lott is famously private about his personal life. He is known to have at least two children. Son Vida assists the artist in his Fifth Ward studio/home.

The novel was first published in 1997 by Harper, San Francisco.  Plot summary  Privy to the lives of all humans, whose prayers he carries from their mouths into the presence of God, the Archangel Raphael enters into the worlds of two insignificant households: the family of Tobit, and the family of Raguel. The ageing Tobit and his wife Anna, who have been exiled in Nineveh, are almost overwhelmed by the turns that their life together has taken. Tasked with oversight of a commercial enterprise owned by the King of Assyria, Sargon II, Tobit is able to provide a comfortable life for his family. Not content to lie low in this foreign and dangerous land, however, the merchant makes the life of his family precarious by his nightly activities. When the King and his murderous son, Sennacherib, leave the corpses of Jews out in the streets or on refuse tips, Tobit rescues the bodies and facilitates a proper burial. Returning from one such nocturnal mission, Tobit falls asleep in his own courtyard. While he is sleeping a sparrow defecates on his face, and when he wakes it is to find that he is blind. Where he once saved the bodies of his fellow Jews and gave the poor among them money, now Tobit is reduced to a life of angry passivity, while his exasperated wife is forced to take up sewing for prosperous families of the neighbourhood. The lives of Raguel, his wife, Edna, and his daughter, Sarah, are no less unfortunate. Afraid of arranged marriage and the ‘embrace of a virtual stranger’, the beautiful young Sarah has made a Faust-like pact with a demon named Asmodeus. Edna’s zeal to have her daughter married ensures that she is approached by many men, all of whom desire her hand. Each new husband is found dead in the morning, and, by the time the number has risen to seven, she is suicidal with regret. Ecbatana, their hometown, is filled with suspicious chatter, and Sarah’s reputation, and with it the reputation of her family, has been shattered. Her prayer to the Almighty that he might end her life coincides with Tobit’s prayer that God might do the same, and it is Raphael who carries their morbid requests into the presence of God. Convinced that God will answer his macabre prayer, Tobit begins preparations for an imminent death. Chief among those he must make ready for this eventuality is his son, Tobias, who has ‘always been somewhat slower to understand things than most people’.Buechner, Frederick (1997). On the Road with the Archangel. New York: HarperSanFrancisco. p. 30. For the preservation of the household, Tobit insists that his son must set out on a journey to the home of an old friend, Gabael, in far-off Media, with whom the crafty old merchant has hidden two sacks of silver. As Tobias sets out on the road he is met by a stranger, Azarias, who is mysteriously well acquainted with both with Media and Gabael. Unbeknown to Tobias, his new companion is the Archangel Raphael, who has taken it upon himself to step down into the material world in order to bring about a reversal in fortune for this beleaguered family. Before long, the disguised archangel realises the wisdom of his decision to join Tobias. While Azarias fishes in the Tigris for their supper one evening, his naïve companion, who has taken to swimming in the deep water, becomes embroiled in a life and death struggle with a large fish. Following the fight, in which Tobias himself is nearly killed, Azarias directs him to remove the innards from the great fish, and stow them away in a bag, claiming that they might have some future use. As the two travellers enter Ecbatana, Azarias informs Tobias of his plan to see the young man married to Sarah, the beautiful daughter of a friend of his named Raguel. Despite his initial fear of the proposition, having heard tale of Sarah and her husbands, Tobias agrees to enter into the marriage contract. Azarias’s suggestion that the bridegroom burn some of the fish entrails before heading into the bridal chamber results in the final defeat of Asmodeus, who is overpowered by the smoke and sent fleeing from the scene. The family rejoice in the morning when they find the newlyweds alive and happy. When Azarias, who has been despatched to Media by Tobias, returns with Tobit’s silver in hand, the new couple begin their journey back to Nineveh. Tobit and Anna, who have begun to fear that their son has met his death, are transported by joy at his return with his new wife. Once more at the direction of Azarias, Tobias makes use of his fermented fish entrails, rubbing them on the eyes of his blind father. The miraculous return of Tobit’s sight is cause for further joy, and the novel closes as Raphael privately reveals his true identity to Tobias, encouraging him as he departs to continue in his father’s charitable ways.  Characters  * Raphael/Azarias: A kindly, wise, and powerful angelic figure, whose foremost responsibility is to see that the prayers of humans reach the presence of God. Leaving the six other archangels to carry out this task, Raphael, who narrates the novel, enters into the lives of the other characters as the mysterious traveller, Azarias. He watches over and advises the young Tobias in his journey, and by his gentle direction brings about an end to the curse of Sarah, the marriage of Sarah and Tobias, the retrieval of Tobit’s family silver, and finally an end to Tobit’s blindness. * Tobit: a gruff and melancholy individual, who blames God for the exile of his family, his own blindness, and the resulting misfortune that descends upon his household. Convinced that God is merely a “score keeper”, Tobit engages himself daily in the practice of working up good deeds in order to keep the Almighty’s punishing hand at bay. Despite his pessimistic outlook, the old man is unwaveringly charitable, interning the bodies of Jews that have been brutalised by the Assyrian king, and quietly offering financial assistance to families that are in need. * Anna: the wife of Tobit, Anna is resourceful and shrewd. When he is struck blind she takes upon herself the burden of providing for the household, utilising her skills with a thread and needle begin an embroidering business, catering for wealthy families in the neighbourhood. * Raguel: convinced that God does not exist, Raguel’s outlook is one of pessimistic scepticism. He suffers greatly while watching his daughter’s suffering as, one by one, her husbands die, and her reputation is destroyed within their hometown. His youth, and even his faith, are revived, however, by the coming of Tobias and Azarias, who between them end the curse that lies upon his family, and bring happiness to his daughter. * Edna: though she appears cold, calculated, and unfeeling, Edna is in actuality deeply concerned with the future of her daughter. Her concern, however, leads her into attempts to control Sarah’s life, arranging unsuitable marriages for her, which are continuously frustrated. * Tobias: young and impressionable, Tobias is prone to daydreaming and flights of fancy. This earns him a reputation for being simple minded and naïve – a reputation that he will eventually dislodge as, with the help of his travelling companion and mentor, Azarias, he wins a beautiful wife, brings an end to her curse, retrieves his family’s silver, and cures his father’s blindness. * Sarah: renowned for her beauty, Sarah is terrified at the prospect of marriage. Her mother’s constant attempts to see her paired with the men of Ecbatana prompts her to make a Faust-like pact with a demon, Asmodeus. As Asmodeus proceeds to murder her first husband, and her six subsequent husbands, she is so weighted down by the situation that she becomes suicidal. When Tobias arrives in Ecbatana with his mysterious friend, Azarias, he brings with him a new life, and an end to her oppression at the hands of Asmodeus.  Themes  Buechner scholar Dale Brown describes On the Road with the Archangel as ‘a kind of valedictory piece’,Brown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. London: Westminster John Knox Press. p. 339. an ‘encore visit to several of Buechner’s concerns – theories of God, notions of grace and forgiveness, the weightiness of guilt, and the need for acceptance’.Brown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. London: Westminster John Knox Press. p. 320. Buechner’s return to a first-person narrator, in the form of the Archangel Raphael, is marked by a difference in tone and perspective. Whereas doubt-filled prior narrators, in describing the lives and actions of their God-struck fellow-travellers, have given expression to the scepticism of the reader, the Archangel who ‘pass[es] in and out of the presence of the Holy One’Buechner, Frederick (1997). On the Road with the Archangel. New York: HarperSanFrancisco. p. 1. cannot be a repository for doubt. Rather than using his narrator as a means of voicing scepticism, Buechner’s archangel comments on, and relays, the doubts of the other characters, offering statements about the nature of God with a gentle, authoritative confidence. With this new narrative voice the author is able to present a perspective on theological questions concerning suffering, and God’s goodness and sovereignty that is unique to his previous novels.  Composition  On the Road with the Archangel was published four years after the release of Buechner’s twelfth novel, The Son of Laughter (1993). In the intervening years the author published a single collection of essays, reflections, and poetry, titled The Longing for Home: recollections and reflections (1996). Buechner’s dedication of the anthology to his five grandsons reveals the author’s transition into a new phase of life, as does the dedication at the opening of On the Road with the Archangel, which reads: ‘To the memory of James Merrill, who spoke with archangels, and a friendship of fifty-five years’.Buechner, Frederick (1997). On the Road with the Archangel. New York: HarperSanFrancisco. p. 5. Merrill, a Pulitzer Prize winning poet, had died in 1995. A childhood friend of Buechner’s, as young men the two writers had spent the summer of 1948 writing together. Merrill even contributing a line to Buechner's first novel, A Long Day’s Dying (1950). Concerning the inspiration for the novel, in an interview given to the San Diego Weekly Reader the author said: > I had my seventieth birthday two summers ago, and I began thinking about > things people write when they get to be old codgers. I thought about > Shakespeare. I thought about how at the end of his life he wrote these > wonderful sort of fairy tale plays like The Tempest and The Winter’s Tale, > and everything ends up wonderfully, and it’s sort of too good not to be > true. I cast about for something like that kind of fairy tale, and something > drew me to the Book of Tobit, which I’d read before, and I’d decided it was > not my thing. But all of a sudden it was. It would be my sort of Tempest or > Winter’s Tale.Judith Moore, ‘Reading’, San Diego Weekly Reader, December 4 > (1997), p.65. Buechner’s novelisation of the Book of Tobit is anticipated in his meditations on the figure of Tobias in earlier works. Originally published in Peculiar Treasures: a Biblical who’s who (1979), and subsequently republished in Listening to Your Life: daily meditations with Frederick Buechner (1992), and Beyond Words: daily readings in the ABC’s of faith (2004), the author’s reflections reveal a sustained fascination with the story of Tobias: '[T]he best part of the story is the short, no-nonsense prayer with which he married her. \\"And now I take not this my sister for lust, but in truth,\\" he said. \\"Command that I and she may find mercy and grow old together. Amen\\" (Tobit 8:8- 9). Never has the knot been more securely or simply or eloquently tied.'  Critical reception  On the Road with the Archangel was well received by reviewers in both the Washington Post and New York Times. Writing for the former, George Garrett concluded that the novel ‘sings and dances’, and that the author is ‘as good as we have’.George Garrett, ‘Informed Opinions’, Washington Post, December 7, 1997, p.10. In his New York Times review of the novel, Alfred Corn found that Buechner’s latest work ‘works to justify the ways of God to man by implying that adversities are sometimes remedied, and that curses can never rival the steadying power given us when we praise being’. He continues: > This clergyman can tell a story that has a theological dimension without > sounding sanctimonious or trite, partly because his writing style is based > on contemporary speech and partly because his turn of mind is ironic, > unsentimental. He's been able to update Mark Twain's sense of comedy, so > that his books, no matter how exotic the setting or characters, always sound > idiomatically American.Alfred Corn, ‘God’s Mailman’, New York Times, October > 26, 1997, p.23. Buechner scholar Dale Brown judged the style of the novel to be innovative, writing that it has ‘a fairy-tale quality that is new in Buechner, a lightness that seems a break from the three preceding novels’.Brown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. London: Westminster John Knox Press. p. 320. Despite this apparent break in style from his previous works, Brown was also careful to note the thematic continuity within Buechner’s novels of the decade: 'Buechner’s work of the mid-1990s continues his preoccupation with infusing the old stories with new vitality, wondering about the lives of near-saints, studying ambiguity, admitting mixed feelings, and exploring still the flow between memoir and fiction.'Brown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. London: Westminster John Knox Press. p. 318. In her review published in America, Patricia DeLeeuw pointed out that, again, here Buechner had found ‘his favourite theme in an ancient source’,Patricia DeLeeuw, ‘On the Road with the Archangel’, America, March 28, 1998, p.26. while David Stewart, writing for Christianity Today, suggested that Buechner’s ‘distinctive gift lies in giving voice to the streak of ambiguity that runs through human existence’. Stewart concludes that: ‘amid the ambiguity that is our lot, the Almighty is at work, quietly and profoundly’.David Stewart, ‘Touched by an Angel’, Christianity Today, February 9, 1998. In a review written for the San Diego Weekly Reader Judith Moore concurs with this sentiment, writing that On the Road with the Archangel makes the reader ‘want to fall on your knees and kiss the damp earth, you’re just so glad to be alive’.Judith Moore, ‘Reading’, San Diego Weekly Reader, December 4, 1997, p.65.

Michel was the first woman commercial traveler (traveling salesperson) in the United States and early in life traveled through Michigan for the N. K. Fairbank Company, of Chicago. She later gave up traveling and became the first editor of a strictly literary magazine, being associated with Charles Wells Moulton in Buffalo, New York on The Magazine of Poetry, and with Mary Livermore in literary work. Biography Jeannette (nickname, \\"Nettie\\") Leila Champion was born in Oswego, New York, September 26, 1863. She was descended from several of the most prominent early Colonial families, and was a lineal descendant of Joseph Jenckes Jr., who cut the dies for the pine tree shilling's used in Massachusetts, and from Joseph Jenckes, his son, who for twenty years, was governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Her great- grandfather, Samuel Tefft, was a member of the Rhode Island General Assembly that on May 4, 1776, two months before the Declaration of Independence, voted to sever all political relationships with the home country of Great Britain. Her father was Mortimer A. Champion, who was a lineal descendant of Henry Champion, one of the early settlers of the Connecticut Valley and whose son, Mehitable, carried despatches for George Washington's army. Michel's mother was Cecelia Penny Champion, a descendant of the Clark family, of central New York. Michel received her early education in the public schools of Syracuse, New York, and later in the public schools of Oswego. Career She married Mr. Michel, March 29, 1882, but the marriage lasted for less than one year. Being obliged to support herself, she went out as an advertising agent for a large wholesale house of Chicago, Illinois, and was the first woman in the U.S. to fill such a position. She then became a \\"drummer\\" (traveling commercial salesman), visiting the drug trade in the interests of an Eastern supply house. She was one of the first, if not the first, women sent out as an agent for staple articles, traveling from place to place with her trunk of samples. Her territory includes the States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. As a drummer, she was very successful, but left the road at the end of two years. She then took a course in stenography in Prof. Augustus J. Warner's Elmira Business and Shorthand College in Elmira, New York, in 1888, and was graduated in three months, one of the best qualified students sent out by that school during a term of 25 years. In the fall of 1888, she entered the office of The Magazine of Poetry in Buffalo, New York, and took charge of the correspondence as an expert stenographer. The following year, she became the business manager of the magazine, a position she resigned in 1891 to become its editor (through 1896). She also wrote prose articles and biographies for it. She was intimately acquainted with the prominent poets and writers of her day. St. John's-Grace Episcopal church Michel was interested in all movements for the advancement of women, and she represented business interests in various conventions throughout the country. Later life and death Michel was a member of the National Woman's Press Association of Washington, D.C., and the King's Daughters. She was a communicant of St. John's Episcopal Church, Buffalo, as well as an Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Michel owned the homestead on Tug Hill, west of Peekskill, New York, the house on which was built from logs cut on the farm in the early 1850s. She had been ill for several years in later life. She died at the Seney Hospital in Brooklyn following an operation for appendicitis on June 29, 1912. Her husband, Elijah L. Roake, accompanied Michel's body to Oswego, New York for the funeral, with interment at that city's Rural Cemetery. Michel was also survived by a half-brother, Adelbert Foster, and a half-sister, Ella Skineer; George Wilson and his mother, Emmery, who live on the old homestead on Tug Hill; Mrs. Lena Helig; and Mrs. Thomas B.

USC PhD student Pedro Loureiro wrote that Tachibana's arrest by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \\"became the most publicized and sensational Japanese espionage case in the United States during 1941.\\"Loureiro, p. 117. Education and training He attended the Japanese Naval Academy and the Japanese Naval War College, and was a graduate from both. He held the position of commander in the Navy of Japan, and he also served as a language officer. In 1933 he boarded a training ship and visited the United States for the first time. He completed his academic studies in February 1940 after examining the foreign policy and history of the United States.Loureiro, p. 107. He entered the United States that month,Loureiro, p. 107-108. and enrolled in the University of Southern California (USC). He went to Los Angeles in late April of that year.Loureiro, p. 108. Loureiro wrote that \\"Tachibana had little training or experience in intelligence\\". Espionage Tachibana began attending the university in September 1940. He received the rank of commander from the Japanese authorities in December of that year. His studies at USC ended in February 1941. Tachibana collected information about U.S. military installations on the West Coast;Loureiro, p. 112. the ONI later determined 70% of the information collected was already publicly available.Loureiro, p. 115. Tachibana himself stated that he did not experience difficulty collecting information since \\"the United States up to the very last operated on a peacetime basis with practically no restrictions on communications and the like.\\" He asked nisei (second-generation Japanese American) women to be with him on trips to lower suspicions from outside parties; he never informed them of the true reasons he took the trips. The Eleventh Naval District (11ND) was based in San Diego, California.Loureiro, p. 105. Counterintelligence, prosecution, and departure Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) employee Henry Claiborne, a lieutenant in the Navy, in early June of that year, gave notice to the Los Angeles office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that the ONI had begun monitoring Tachibana as the agency believed that he was acting as a foreign agent for Japan; the FBI chose not to open its own investigation while the ONI investigated. 11ND's district intelligence office also opened an investigation on Tachibana as it was suspecting he was trying to damage U.S. naval operations. Loureiro wrote that this office \\"directed and carried out most of the counterintelligence operations.\\"Loureiro, p. 118. Initially the FBI was hesitant to pursue prosecution due to diplomatic issues as Tachibana was a known affiliate of the Japanese government; it initially had chosen not to pursue prosecution.Loureiro, p. 109. The ONI asked the FBI to reconsider when the ONI believed that Tachibana may leave the United States. Ultimately the FBI agreed to pursue prosecution, and the Department of State authorized Tachibana's prosecution.Loureiro, p. 110. The FBI arrested Tachibana at the Olympic Hotel, where he stayed. The Japanese Navy paid Tachibana's bail money. The FBI counted 107 pages of evidence that it had collected from the hotel room.Loureiro, p. 111. The Embassy of Japan in Washington, DC, on June 9, 1941, received a complaint from the government of Japan about the arrest.Loureiro, p. 116. The State Department, wishin to preserve Japan-United States relations, ultimately asked the United States attorney to no longer pursue prosecution so long as Tachibana leaves the country.Loureiro, p. 116-117. He boarded the Nitta Maru on June 21 in San Francisco, which U.S. government officials forced him to do, and set sail for Japan. Aftermath In September 1941 he entered the Third Bureau of the Japanese Navy, which handled intelligence matters. The High Command of the Navy assigned Tachibana to the group that managed the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941; according to Loureiro, what he learned about the U.S. Navy \\"was an important factor\\" in his placement. Loureiro wrote that the Tachibana arrest caused 11ND to \\"effectively\\" end the Southern California Japanese naval spying ring and taught U.S. authorities the Japanese Navy's contacts and what data the Japanese Navy desired.

A female artist of Muslim faith and of Chinese-Malay descent, her works examined notions of identity, subjectivity, and community practices. Pedagogy and research further complemented her artistic practice, with Juliana having taught fine art at Kolej Bandar Utama in Kuala Lumpur and worked as a Singapore-based researcher for the Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong. Juliana is notable as \\"one of the early voices of Malay women contemporary artists\\", exploring the position of Muslim women in Singaporean society through her practice since the 1990s. She was an active member of significant contemporary art groups in Singapore such as The Artists Village (TAV) and Plastique Kinetic Worms (PKW). Juliana also co-curated the first iteration of the community-based Jatiwangi Art Festival in 2006, later taking Jatiwangi in West Java, Indonesia as her \\"second home\\". On 27 August 2014, following a long battle with cervical cancer, Juliana passed away at the age of 44.  Education and personal life  Juliana was born in 1970 to a Chinese mother and a Malay father, both of Muslim faith. From 1989 to 1990, Juliana was a student at the LASALLE College of the Arts, leaving the college without completing her studies there. In 1993, she left Singapore to pursue her art education in Western Australia, graduating in 1994 with a Diploma in Fine Art from the TAFE Claremont Art School, Perth (now known as Central Institute of Technology). In 1996, she proceeded to obtain a Bachelor of Visual Arts from the Curtin University of Technology, Perth (now known as Curtin University). Juliana's relationship with religion developed over the years. Her parents have been suggested to be conservative, with Juliana mentioning in a 1992 article in The Straits Times that she would \\"have to lock [her]self in [her] bedroom to paint [her] nude self-portraits.\\" She wore headscarves as a teenager, only to stop during her university years in Australia; she also embarked on pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina. Following her co-curation of the first Jatiwangi Art Festival in 2006, Juliana would find a \\"second home\\" in Jatiwangi, West Java, Indonesia, returning to the semi-industrialised village several times over the years and continuing to organise some of her projects there. In October 2007, Juliana was diagnosed with stage three cervical cancer, which went into remission following treatment. Juliana continued to practice art while receiving treatment, checking herself into hospital every day for chemotherapy while preparing for her solo show held at Plastique Kinetic Worms just two months later in December 2007. In February 2014, she would have to undergo intensive surgery following a relapse of the disease, which had spread to other organs. By March 2014, the local art community had rallied together for Artists for Artist, a fundraising exhibition to fund Juliana's medical treatment. Organised by Yvonne Lee, former director of the now-defunct Plastique Kinetic Worms, the exhibition included works from more than 40 artists, featuring prominent Singaporean artists such as Amanda Heng, Vincent Leow, and Tang Da Wu. Juliana would succumb to cancer on 27 August 2014, passing away at the age of 44.  Career = Early career and collaborations  Throughout her artistic career, Juliana participated in over 60 exhibitions locally and internationally, in countries such as Australia, Germany, Ireland and Poland. From the 1990s onwards, she was an active member of significant contemporary art groups in Singapore such as The Artists Village (TAV) and Plastique Kinetic Worms (PKW). In 1991, for the National Sculpture Exhibition at the then-National Museum Art Gallery, Juliana would perform alongside Amanda Heng and Ho Soon Yeen for Heng's performance work, Woman, Space and Objects, which explored the interconnections between exhibition site, objects, and the bodies of women. In their attempt to break from stereotypes, their performance envisioned an ironic outcome, with Heng parodying the stance of the Statue of Liberty. In 1992, Juliana would once again work with Heng to perform Her Identity alongside Ho and Chen Kun Yi for The Space, a significant exhibition organised by The Artists Village at the now-demolished Hong Bee Warehouse. Later in September 1992, Juliana would exhibit work alongside Chen for A Frame Of Mind, a two-artist exhibition exploring issues of women and the body as part of The Substation's New Criteria exhibition series. After graduating from Curtin University of Technology, Perth in 1996, Juliana would work as a fine arts lecturer at Kolej Bandar Utama in Kuala Lumpur, only returning to Singapore in November 1998. Back in Singapore, she would make a living through commissioned work and by teaching art to children.  Continued collaborations  In 1999, Juliana would hold her first solo exhibition at Plastique Kinetic Worms, entitled Collaborations. For the show, Juliana faxed copies of a photograph of herself to 16 artists based both locally and overseas, with instructions for them to alter her portrait. The original photograph featured Juliana wearing a traditional Sumatran Minangkabau headgear, shaped like a pair of water buffalo horns. The over 35 images of her face would feature in the exhibition, some covered in graffiti or pink lace, and some hung like a toilet roll on the wall. PKW would continue to serve as a significant platform in Juliana's artistic career, with her being involved in festivals and exhibitions such as The Worms Festival I and II, Singapore in 1999 and 2000 respectively, and the Flag Project; PKW's 4th Annual Show in Singapore and South Korea in conjunction with the 2002 Gwangju Biennale. At PKW, Juliana would also curate and participate in the performance and installation exhibition Fusion Strength in 2001, with it travelling to Indonesia and Australia in 2003 and 2005, respectively. In 2001, for Kampung 2000, a four-day Malay theatre and arts festival at The Substation organised by Teater Ekamatra, Juliana would stage The Veil, a performance artwork that examined Muslim female identity by taking the hijab and tudong as its starting point. For the performance, she cloaked herself in black and hid her face behind masks traditionally worn in areas of Saudi Arabia to indicate a woman’s chastity and status as her husband’s property. She held a placard in her hands that read: “The Subjugation of Women is a Worn-Out Habit in Saudi Arabia”. While The Veil was shown in Singapore, Thailand and Germany, it was seen as controversial predominantly within Singapore, where Malay-language newspaper Berita Harian criticised the work’s stance on Islam, with the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) further lodging a complaint against the event organisers. Juliana responded to media attention by explaining her desire to question narrow definitions of Muslim female identity. In an interview with Time Magazine, she would state: \\"I’m a Muslim, but the Koran doesn’t say you have to veil. That’s a man-made law.\\" In 2003, Juliana was the only female artist to show work for Berita Harian at The Substation, a group exhibition curated by Khairuddin Hori that sought to question the identity of Malay artists in Singapore. From 2004 to 2006, Juliana would also work as the Singapore-based researcher for Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong. Juliana participated in the 2005 group exhibition Situation: Collaborations, Collectives & Artist Networks from Sydney, Singapore & Berlin at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia, curated by Russell Storer. Also featured were other Singaporean artists from The Artists Village, including Tang Da Wu, Lee Wen, and Agnes Yit. Australian artist Colin G Reaney would perform alongside Juliana for the exhibition.  Jatiwangi and after  In 2006, Juliana co-curated the first iteration of the Jatiwangi Art Festival in West Java alongside Bandung-based curator Heru Hikayat, in collaboration with Jatiwangi art Factory director Arief Yudi. The success of the first iteration in 2006 led the organisers to organise the second iteration of the Jatiwangi Art Festival in 2008. A community arts festival involving residencies for local and foreign artists to organise events with villagers in Jatisutera, West Java, Indonesia, it continued as a bi-annual art festival that sought to address social issues faced by the community. Jatiwangi would play an important role in Juliana's personal life and artistic practice; in 2009 she would hold a solo show, Tali Timba, at Jatiwangi art Factory, and in 2010 would perform with her collaborators from Jatiwangi at the 6th Future of Imagination festival. In December 2007, Kites, Veils and Boarding Passes would be held at Plastique Kinetic Worms, a solo exhibition that marked the developments in Juliana's artistic practice since 1991. Receiving her cervical cancer diagnosis just two months prior, Juliana staged the exhibition while undergoing daily chemotherapy sessions at the time. Curated by Australian artist, longtime friend, and frequent collaborator Karee Dahl, the exhibition spanned three rooms and emphasised Juliana's use of veils, cloaks, and masks across her practice, also featuring a video library of Juliana's documented past performances. Following Juliana's death in 2014, a selection of performance art photographs by Koh Nguang How would be exhibited in 2016 at the Objectifs Centre for Photography and Film, Singapore, some documenting Juliana's performance work alongside other instances of performance art photography for the exhibition Two-Way Mirror.In 2019, a selection of music and lyrics from Juliana's projects at Jatiwangi from 2009 to 2010 would be posthumously exhibited at the 6th Singapore Biennale, curated by artistic director Patrick D. Flores. The music album Tali Timba from Juliana’s solo exhibition in Jatiwangi in 2009 was presented with another 2010 album, For Peace and Togetherness: Tantejules dan Pemuda Inisiatif, which consisted of seven songs in English and Bahasa Indonesia “promoting and celebrating peace, love, and solidarity.”  Art  Juliana came from a background in painting, having done many portraits in particular. Juliana began to see herself as a subject, bringing the human face into her work and distorting it, fond of the idea of being able to convey a face by concealing it. This notion of concealment carries through in later works which feature masks, veils, and cloaks. While her identity as a Muslim woman artist would lead her to draw upon issues of the hijab and tudong in works such as The Veil (2001) or Covered, Veiled, Bound (2003), Juliana would state that she did not see herself as representing minority groups. Collaboration was a significant aspect of Juliana's practice, whether with other artists, collectives, or communities, she described herself as being better able to \\"push [her] boundaries\\" when working with others. This would manifest in her many collaborations with other artists and with collectives and groups such as The Artists Village, Plastique Kinetic Worms, and with communities in Jatiwangi. Australian artists Karee Dahl and Colin G Reaney are noted frequent collaborators of Juliana, performing alongside her at previous projects such as Traffic Space at Para Site, Hong Kong in 2001, The houseWORK Project at the Alliance Française de Singapour, Singapore in 2003, the CP Open Biennale, Jakarta in 2003, and TAV's Artists Investigating Monuments series in 2004/5.

In the mid-1950s it claimed to be the largest shopping center on the West Coast of the United States and the third-largest in the country. It was located along Laurel Canyon Boulevard from Oxnard to Vanowen, and west along Victory Boulevard. Like its competitor Panorama City Shopping Center to the north, Valley Plaza started with one core development and grew over time to market, under the single name \\"Valley Plaza\\", a collection of adjacent retail developments with multiple developers, owners, and opening dates.\\"Fall\\" in \\"The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of Valley Plaza\\" (archived), Sirinya Tritipeskul for UCLA course \\"Urban Planning 253: Sprawl\\", Professor Randy Crane, Fall Quarter 2007 Opening The idea to develop the plaza came from developer Bob Symonds in 1942, who had helped to create the Miracle Mile concentration of shops on Wilshire Boulevard. from started with a 2-story Sears store announced in 1948. The center was on a 50-acre lot including 15 acres of parking. The shopping center opened August 12, 1951, with parking for 4000 cars, and having cost between $20,000,000 and $40,000,000 (depending on the source) to build. The Sears opened September 12, 1951. Other early anchors were Thrifty Drug Stores, J. J. Newberry, Bond's, Gallenkamp Shoes, and multiple supermarkets: McDaniels, Alexander's and a combined Mayfair-Owl/Rexall supermarket-and-drugstore. On January 22, 1954, the Occidental Savings Bank opened a branch designed by Stiles O. Clements, famous for the design of Streamline Moderne retail buildings on Miracle Mile, Coulter's and the Mullen & Bluett buildings, amongst many others. Setting records Valley Plaza would later extend along Victory Boulevard to cover 100 acres. By 1956 it claimed to cover 100 acres with 1,039,000 square feet of retail space, the third-largest in the nation at that time, after Cross County Shopping Center on Long Island and Northland Center in Greater Detroit. It claimed to have close to $100 million in annual sales. The Valley Plaza Merchants Associated counted the May Company department store at Oxnard St., as part of \\"Valley Plaza\\", but later, in 1968, May would build an enclosed mall, Laurel Plaza, attached to their store, thus forming a separate identity from Valley Plaza. The May Co. being very large, , Valley Plaza claimed to have the second-largest suburban branch department store in the country, outsized only by a branch of Hudson's in suburban Detroit. Expansion A J. C. Penney opened on the north side of Victory Blvd. bordering the Hollywood Freeway in early 1959.“Penney Co Maps Birthday Party”, Valley Times, September 29, 1959 It was also around this time that the Hollywood Freeway was extended north to Magnolia Boulevard and the Ventura Freeway was completed nearby, greatly increasing the accessibility of the center. A Goodyear tire store also opened around this time. In 1960 the Los Angeles Federal Savings and Loan Tower, now known as the Valley Plaza Tower, was completed. The building is now occupied by Wells Fargo Bank. It was upon opening, the tallest building in the San Fernando Valley. Architects were Douglas Honnold and John Rex and the style is \\"Corporate International\\". It was one of the first skyscrapers built in Los Angeles after the 1957 repeal of a 150-foot height limit ordinance. Murals that have adorned the full height and width of the western side of the tower over the decades. Today it portrays the history of Los Angeles; previous subjects were the 1976 United States Bicentennial, the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, and former football team of the city, the Los Angeles Raiders. Decline Reasons for the decline of Valley Plaza included: *The area became progressively lower in income, as working-class Hispanics replaced middle- and upper-class Whites as the suburbs expanded ever westward and northward. However, this allowed lower-end retail, such as the 99 Cent Only store and Smart & Final Extra!, to thrive in places like North Hollywood. *Competition - Valley Plaza competed with the large Panorama City Shopping Center from the same era, and from the 1960s onward, numerous other malls were built in the Valley such as Sherman Oaks Fashion Square. Later, the renovated Burbank Town Center and power centers, like Burbank Empire Center and The Plant in Panorama City, would compete. *Multiple owners - by 1999 the area marketed as Valley Plaza had dozens of owners, making it more difficult to formulate a strategy and react to the market *Other factors such as effects of the 1994 Northridge earthquake, perception of crime, and more. From the original development on the west side of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, the current status as of mid-2020 is as follows: * from Archwood south to Kittridge: site of McDaniels Market (6657 Laurel Canyon) is now a Ralphs, block is also home to 99 Cents Only Stores and Smart & Final Extra! * from Kittridge south to Hamlin (original site of Mayfair-Rexall et al.) - now occupied by Roy Romer Middle School and ISANA Palmati Academy charter school * from Hamlin south to Victory - the Sears store is empty, having closed in 2019. A Burlington continues to operate (though it closed for COVID-19). The strip of shops behind (west of) Sears, is mostly occupied. * from Victory south to Sylvan - mostly abandoned storefronts * from Sylvan south to Erwin - an operating Gold's Gym and various abandoned storefronts along Laurel Canyon and around the parking lot at the back Along Victory Boulevard west of Laurel Canyon, the Penney's building at 12215 Victory is used by West Coast University as a campus. The Regal Cinemas continues to operate. The McMahan's Furniture store at 12126 Victory Blvd. is now a DaVita dialysis center. Further south along Laurel Canyon (Laurel Plaza and the May Co.), after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the Laurel Plaza mall was closed due to damage but the department store May Co. remained open. It became a Macy’s in 2006 which operated until 2016, after the property was sold for redevelopment.https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-laurel-plaza- sold-20140123-story.html The site is now under construction as NOHO West, a mixed-use development including retail.https://www.dailynews.com/regal- cinemas-24-hour-fitness-and-old-navy-headed-to-noho-west-project-at-former- laurel-plaza-shopping-center Dashed hopes for renovation After the earthquake, the renovation of Valley Plaza and Laurel Plaza area became a project of the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles.Shortly after 2000, J. H. Snyder acquired the core Valley Plaza property from lender iStar, and announced plans for a $300 million renovation. Over the next 10 years, leases were not renewed and tenants were evicted, resulting in a mostly abandoned property.

Author Ta-Nehisi Coates attended Jones' memorial service, and later wrote at length about Jones' life and death in his 2015 book Between the World and Me, noting that the tragedies of racism are impossible to escape for Black people, even those well-off. Biography Jones was the son of Prince C. Jones Sr. and Dr. Mabel Jones, a physician and the daughter of a sharecropper. He attended Howard University, was a personal trainer at a suburban Washington D.C. gym, and was set to enlist in the Navy. He had an infant daughter, Nina, with his fiancé Candace Carson. He was described as upstanding, religious, and a health food fanatic. Killing by police On 1 September 2000, Prince Jones was unarmed and driving his Jeep Cherokee to meet his fiancée. Undercover police officer Carlton Jones (no relation) of Prince George’s County, Maryland, followed Prince Jones for 15 miles in an unmarked vehicle into in Fairfax County, Virginia. Officer Jones displayed his gun and announced he was police (though he was not in uniform and did not display his badge). According to police and witness statements,, Prince Jones rammed the police vehicle with his Jeep, leading the officer to shoot at Jones' Jeep 16 times, striking him six times (including five times in the back). Carlton Jones later explained the killing as a case of mistaken identity, and in October 2000 the county prosecutor, Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Robert F. Horan Jr., declined to file criminal charges against Officer Jones. This decision aggrieved Prince Jones' family, friends, and local civil rights leaders, who noted Prince George’s County's documented history of police brutality and decried the continued failure of the criminal justice system to hold police accountable for serious misconduct. The county prosecutor's inaction was tantamount to \\"legitimizing murder\\", they said. The Prince George's Fraternal Order of Police lauded the prosecutor's decision, and of Officer Jones said \\"it's clear that he was defending himself.\\" A memorial service for Jones was held at Howard University. In January 2006, a Prince George’s County Circuit Court civil jury determined that Prince Jones's death at the hands of the Prince George County police was wrongful, and awarded $2.5 million in damages to Prince Jones' daughter.

It was sometimes described as a county (comitatus). Attestations According to Nonn's collection of attestations: *In a letter of 633-56, from Bishop Paul of Verdun to Bishop Desiderius of Cahors the term \\"Masao\\" is used to describe a travel route of the Merovingian king Sigibert III, travelling via Maastricht from Laon to Cologne.Nonn, p.89; Ewig, pp.1,11. *In a charter of 714, Susteren is described as being in the \\"pagus Mosariorum\\".Nonn, pp.89–90. *In a testament of 732/3 attributed to Adela of Pfalzel, a place called Scriptinas is described as being \\"in pago Mosao super ripam Mosae\\".Nonn, p.90. *In a charter of 741/2 which is reported in two versions in Sint-Truiden records, a \\"count or duke of Hasbania\\" (comes vel dux Hasbanie) named Robert, son of Lambert, granted lands near Diest to Sint-Truiden Abbey.Despy (1961) gives a critical review of this document and its versions. It was recorded in the Abbey chartulary and in the much later third continuation of the chronicle of the Abbey (p.371) In the charter itself this Robert called himself a count, but he was mentioned as a Duke in the biography (Vita) of Bishop Eucherius of Orléans. In surviving versions of that Vita, when Charles Martel exiled Eucherius to Cologne this was under the custody of a Duke Robert of Hasbania (Hasbanio Chrodoberto duce).Vita Eucherii episcopi Aurelianensis MGM Script. rer. mer. VII, 1920 pp.50-51 Remarkably, the lands given to the Abbey were described as being \\"in pago Hasbaniensi et Masuarinsi\\" — literally the land of Hasbanians and Masuarians. The second word is probably related to Masao. Some commentators such as Gorissen, Ewig, and Nonn (p.93), as indicating that Robert had an older type of jurisdiction over an area larger than Hasbania or the Maasgau on their own. *In about 830 Einhard described a place \\"in pago Mosavo\\". *In an 837 plan to divide the Frankish kingdoms one of the counties named (not pagi in this case) is Masagao (in the Annales Bertiniani) or Masagouwi (in Nithard I.6). *In 841, Nithard describes Gilbert (or Giselbert), who may be an ancestor of the so-called Regnarids, as \\"comes Mansuariorum\\", \\"Count of the Mansuari\\".HGH SS rer. Germ. [44]: Nithardi Historiarum p.31 There is uncertainly about how to interpret this terminology, though Gorissen, Ewig and Nonn all see it as likely to be related to the earlier description of \\"Count or Duke\\" Robert. In one surviving manuscript the \\"n\\" is missing. *In 858 Sint-Odiliënberg near Roermond, then known simply as Berg, was described as being \\"in pago Maso\\" and sitting about the river Roer, which is a tributary of the Maas.MGH Diplomata, Lothar II, p.393. *In the Treaty of Meerssen of 870, the Maas river was a dividing line between two Frankish kingdoms. The Maas valley region north of Maastricht is described as having two parts, a lower and higher (subterior and superior) Masau, and each of these two parts was to be divided by the river. The Abbeys in the area, and the \\"districts\\" of Maastricht and Aachen, were treated separately. *In a falsified charter from 858-872, Kessel, Limburg, on the Maas between Roermond and Venlo, is described as \\"in pago Masensi Cassellum\\".MGH Diplomata, Charles the Bald, p.644. *In a falsified royal diploma of Otto the Great from 946 relating to Gembloux Abbey, two places are named in the comitatus (county, note: not a pagus in this case) called \\"Maisou\\": the villa called \\"Mauic\\" and the villa called \\"Biettine\\". The latter was identified by Jean Baerten as Obbicht. *In 950 another Gembloux record mentions a place \\"in pago Masau\\". *A royal charter of 7 Oct 950, Kessel on the left bank of the Maas between Roermond and Venlo is described as being \\"in pago Masalant in comitatu Ruodolfi\\" (in the country of Maasland, in the county of Rudolf).MGH DD Otto I p.210 Note that this time, the \\"Maasland\\" form is used. This is one of the only occasions where a count with jurisdiction in this region is clearly named. *4 Jul 952. I was probably the same count Rudolf who was count near Maaseik. Alden-Eyck near Maaseik (mentioned separately in the Treaty of Meerssen) was described as being \\"in pago Huste in comitatu Ruodulphi\\" (in the country of Huste, in the county of Rudolf).MGH DD Otto I p.235 Not that in this record, although it is on the Maas, Masao or Maasland is not named. Huste or Hufte is generally considered to be a word derived from Hocht, in Lanaken, also on the Maas but approximately 30km southwards. Van de Weerd proposed it was Hoeselt. Wherever it was, it must have been seat of a count. *In an undated record from Fulda the villas called Blaricga [Blerik] and Walaran are mentioned, \\"in pago Masao iuxta flumen More\\". As pointed out by Verhelst, the term Masalant (Maasland) is used mainly when referring to Maastricht, and according to him it is only used by mistake in the 950 case above. In 889, 898 and 919, Maastricht is specifically described as being in the comitatus (county) of Maselant. In the 898 record it is also added that it is in the Pagus of Hasbania. In a different record of 898 it is described instead of being in the pagus of Maseland. In contrast, in another 919 record it is described as being in the comitatus of Hasbania.

In human health, its effects are most notable in inflammation and metabolic syndrome. At the molecular level, cholesterol primarily signals by regulating lipid rafts and raft associated membrane-protein translocation. Mechanism Lipid rafts are loosely defined as regions of lipid heterogeneity in cellular membranes. Lipid raft regulation Cholesterol regulates the function of several membrane proteins associated with lipid rafts. It does so by controlling the formation or depletion of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. The lipid rafts house the membrane proteins and forming or depleting the lipid rafts moves the proteins in or out of the raft environment thereby exposing them to a new environment that can activate or deactivate the proteins. For example, cholesterol directly regulates the affinity of palmitoylated proteins for GM1 containing lipid rafts. Cholesterol signaling through lipid rafts can be attenuated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphophate signaling (PIP2). PIP2 contains mostly polyunsaturated lipids that partition away from saturated lipids. Proteins that bind both lipid rafts and PIP2 are negatively regulated by high levels of PIP2. This effect was observed with phospholipase D. Substrate presentation A protein that is regulated by raft associated protein translocation can be activated by substrate presentation. For example, if an enzyme translocate in the membrane to its substrate it can be activated by localization to its substrate independent of a conformational change in the enzyme. Protein ligand When cholesterol directly binds to a protein and alters its function it can be thought of as a protein ligand. Ion channels Cholesterol is thought to bind to cys loop receptors and allosterically modulate their gating. Role in Disease=Inflammation During an inflammatory response cholesterol is loaded into immune cells including macrophages. The cholesterol is a signal that activates cytokine production and other inflammatory responses. Cholesterol's role in inflammation is central to many diseases. Viral entry Cholesterol loading into cells was recently shown to increase SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Coronary Heart Disease inflammation induced by cholesterol loading into immune cells causes heart disease. A class of drugs called statins blocks cholesterol synthesis and is used extensively in treating heart disease. Steroids Cholesterol is precursor for steroid hormones including progestagens, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. History Brown and Goldstein discovered the LDL receptor and showed cholesterol is loaded into cells through receptor mediated endocytosis. Until recently cholesterol was thought of primarily as a structural component of the membrane. However, more recently, cholesterol uptake was shown to signal an immune response in macrophages. More importantly, the ability to efflux cholesterol through ABC transporters was shown to attenuate (i.e., shut down) the inflammatory response.

APD officer Devin Brosnan was responding to a complaint that a man (Brooks) was asleep in a car blocking a restaurant drive-through lane. At the scene, Brosnan radioed for assistance, and Rolfe arrived some minutes later. Rolfe conducted a breathalyzer exam which indicated that Brooks's blood- alcohol content was above the legal limit for driving. Rolfe and Brosnan began to handcuff Brooks, at which point Brooks fought with the officers, got hold of Brosnan's taser, punched Rolfe, and ran away. Rolfe pursued Brooks on foot. Brooks half-turned and fired the taser toward Rolfe; Rolfe then fired his weapon three times at Brooks, hitting him twice from behind. A third shot struck an occupied car. Brooks died after surgery. Footage of the incident, recorded from the officers' bodycams, a witness's phone and the restaurant's security system, was widely broadcast. Police chief Erika Shields resigned one day later; that same day, Rolfe was fired and Brosnan was placed on administrative duty. Rolfe was charged with felony murder and ten other offenses; Brosnan with aggravated assault and two counts of violation of oath.  People involved  Rayshard Brooks was a 27-year-old African American restaurant worker who lived in Atlanta. He had been married eight years and had three daughters and a stepson. In a February 2020 interview he discussed the two years he spent in prison and his difficulties after being released, such as difficulty finding work. A driving under the influence conviction could have led to revocation of his probation and a return to prison. Garrett Rolfe had been a police officer in the Atlanta Police Department since 2013. He was part of APD units specializing in DUI enforcement. In 2016, he received a written reprimand for aiming his gun at a stolen car being pursued. In May 2019, he was honored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving for making more than 50 DUI arrests the previous year. In early 2020, he undertook training in the use of deadly force and in de-escalation. Devin Brosnan has been an Atlanta police officer since 2018.  Death  At 10:42 p.m. on Friday, June 12, 2020, Atlanta Police Department officer Devin Brosnan arrived at the Wendy's restaurant at 125 University Avenue in South Atlanta to investigate a report of a man (Brooks) asleep in a car which was blocking the drive-through lane. Brosnan awakened Brooks and told him to move the car to a parking space and take a nap; Brooks fell asleep again without moving the car. Brosnan again woke Brooks and Brooks parked the car. Brosnan checked Brooks's driver's license and radioed for assistance from an officer certified to conduct driving under the influence investigations. Officer Garrett Rolfe arrived at 10:56 and, with Brooks's permission, performed a pat-down search for weapons, a field sobriety test, and a breathalyzer test. Brooks appeared impaired and was confused about where he was. He said he had had one to one-and-a-half drinks and denied driving or being too drunk to drive. The Breathalyzer registered a blood alcohol level of 0.108%, above the legal limit of 0.08%. Brooks asked to leave his car in the parking lot overnight and walk to his sister's house a short distance away. News outlets have characterized Brooks as relaxed, friendly, and cooperative. At 11:23, Rolfe told Brooks: \\"All right, I think you've had too much to drink to be driving. Put your hands behind your back for me\\"; he and Brosnan then moved behind Brooks to handcuff him. Brooks tried to break free and he and the officers scuffled on the ground. During the struggle Brosnan drew his taser, but Brooks wrested it from him and fired it; Brosnan says the taser contacted him and he struck his head on the pavement. Brooks stood up and punched Rolfe, who drew his own taser and shot Brooks with it. Brooks fled through the parking lot with Brosnan's taser still in hand. Rolfe pursued him and fired again with his own taser. While still running, Brooks glanced back, half-turned, and fired the second shot of Brosnan's taser capable of two shots before being reloadedin Rolfe's direction. According to prosecutors, Brooks and Rolfe were apart when Rolfe dropped his taser, drew his handgun and shot Brooks once in the midback and once in the buttocks; a third shot struck a nearby vehicle, narrowly missing its three occupants. According to prosecutors, disputed by Rolfe's attorneys, Rolfe then said \\"I got him\\". Two minutes after Brooks was shot Rolfe appeared to unroll a bandage and place it on Brooks's torso. Seven minutes after Brooks was shot an ambulance arrived and he was taken to the hospital, where he died following surgery. Brosnan was treated for a concussion.  Employment actions  The next day, Rolfe was fired and Brosnan was placed on administrative duty. On August 4, Rolfe's attorneys filed a lawsuit against Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Acting Police Chief Rodney Bryant for unlawful dismissal, seeking Rolfe's reinstatement, along with back pay and benefits.  Prosecution  Following standard procedure, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) opened an investigation. The county medical examiner ruled Brooks' death a homicide. On June 17, while the GBI investigation was still ongoing, Paul Howard, the Fulton County District Attorney (DA), announced eleven charges against Rolfe: felony murder, five counts of aggravated assault, four police oath violations, and damage to property. Brosnan was charged with aggravated assault and two counts of violation of oath. Howard argued the taser Brooks had taken posed no danger, as after being fired twice it could not fire again; that Rolfe and Brosnan did not provide timely medical aid to Brooks for over two minutes; and alleged that Rolfe kicked him and Brosnan stood on his shoulders; and that it was a violation of department policy for Rolfe to begin handcuffing Brooks before telling him he was being arrested. Brosnan was released on June 18 after posting a $50,000 signature bond. Around June 18, the Georgia Law Enforcement Organization, a law enforcement nonprofit, began raising funds for Rolfe to pay his legal fees, raising $500,000 by August 13. Rolfe was released on July 1 on a $500,000 bond with conditions. On or about July 14, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr requested that the GBI widen its investigation into the Fulton County DA's office, headed by Howard, to determine whether grand jury subpoenas seeking information about Rolfe were legally issued. Howard was already the subject of a GBI investigation concerning his use of a nonprofit to funnel almost $200,000 of city funds into his personal bank account. On July 20, Rolfe's attorney filed a motion seeking to have DA Howard recused from the Rolfe prosecution on the basis that the he would be called as a necessary witness by the defense to answer regarding statements he made that the attorney alleged were “ethically inappropriate\\" and actions that allegedly \\"systematically sought to deprive Garrett Rolfe of a fair trial and impartial jury.\\" During the week of August 2, the DA's office applied to obtain a search warrant to gain information about the fundraising site set up for Rolfe, attempting to obtain information including on who had established the site, how much money had been raised, and where the money went, representing it wanted the information to support a possible bond violation charge. One of Rolfe's attorneys condemned the request stating, \\"...he [DA Howard] sought to uncover the private information of Americans who donated to Garrett Rolfe’s defense because they believed in his innocence.” Subsequently, a judge denied the warrant application. On August 4, the day Rolfe's attorneys filed the lawsuit for reinstatement, the DA's office filed a motion to revoke Rolfe's bond, alleging that Rolfe had traveled to Florida without permission. Rolfe's attorneys filed a response with the court stating the bond conditions neither placed Rolfe on house arrest/home confinement, nor was he prohibited from traveling out of state, and that they had, as a courtesy, notified prosecutors of his travel via email prior to traveling. On August 12, the presiding judge refused to revoke Rolfe's bond, but amended it prohibiting out of state travel. On August 12, DA Howard was defeated in his bid for re-election. Reactions Memorial for Brooks at the place of his death Demonstrators gathered at the site of the shooting beginning June 12. On June 13, protesters set fire to the Wendy's restaurant outside which Brooks was shot as well as several nearby cars, and broke a television camera. A woman acquainted with Brooks was charged with first-degree arson in connection with the restaurant fire. Protests continued in the area around the Wendy's, there were problems with armed protesters closing adjacent streets with barriers, and on July 4 an 8-year-old girl was killed when the car she was riding in was shot at by protesters. On June 13, Atlanta's police chief Erika Shields resigned; Mayor Bottoms said Shields had resigned in the hope that \\"the city may move forward with urgency and [rebuild] the trust so desperately needed throughout our communities.\\" On June 15, Mayor Bottoms ordered the Atlanta Police Department to overhaul its use-of-force policies. Beginning the day after charges against Rolfe were announced, Atlanta police officers called in sick for their shifts, staging a \\"blue flu\\" protest. In the four days from June 17 to 20, about 170 officers called in sick and officers in 3 out of the city's 6 police zones did not respond to calls. On the evening of June 19 every police officer failed to report for duty in Zone 5, leaving only the three supervisors. Atlanta's Acting Police Chief Bryant said that the department had \\"to shift resources to insure proper coverage\\" due to police absenteeism.Collin Kelley, Interim Atlanta police chief addresses officer sickout in wake of Rayshard Brooks charges, Reporter Newspapers (June 21, 2020). Total arrests citywide dropped by 71% during the sickout.

He is the Leader of the party on Camden London Borough Council representing Hampstead Town. Cooper was elected to represent Hampstead Town Ward on Camden Council in 2015. He became the Leader of the Opposition after the 2018 elections. He has appeared in the national news by highlighting some Labour members disrupting a minute's silence for Tessa Jowell, securing an official rebuke of Sadiq Khan for allegedly misusing crime statistics in 2018, attacking the Revolutionary Communist Group speaking in Camden Council, intervening and stopping Islamophobic violence on the London Underground in September 2019 and helping get rid of antisemitic graffiti in his area in December 2019. He wrote in The Telegraph in 2015 unsuccessfully asking Tories not to vote for Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. He was the deputy chairperson of the Hampstead and Kilburn Conservatives. Before coming a councillor, he was criticised in The Guardian for using Taxpayers' Alliance data to criticise high pay in Camden Council. Cooper was the national chairman of the Conservative youth organisation Conservative Future from 2013 to 2014. The Times reported that the organisation was \\"working really really well\\" until he was a victim of Mark Clarke in the nationally-reported \\"Tatler Tory\\" bullying scandal.

The subsequent developments in HD, UHD, and HDR cameras were influenced by the Viper and its contemporaries.  History  The Viper FilmStream was announced in 2002 by Thomson after being developed by its Grass Valley subsidiary which it had purchased earlier that year. It followed on the tails of the early Sony CineAlta cameras and preceded the Panavision Genesis by less than a year. One feature of the Viper was that it could replay takes immediately after they were shot, which certain cameras of the era (such as early versions of the Genesis) could not. Films shot on the Viper include Michael Mann’s Collateral, Miami Vice, and Public Enemies and David Fincher’s Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Cinematographer Dion Beebe described the Viper as the “primary camera” on Collateral; on both Zodiac and Collateral 35mm film was used only for overcranking. Zodiac was first the digital feature film by a major studio to not use videotape or compression in its capture or editing. Fincher became interested in using the camera on a feature film after shooting commercials for Nike and Xelibri with it. In 2017, Grass Valley received a Scientific and Technical Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its Viper.

He was named the country's top Finn sailor in the first three editions of his Olympic career (1988, 1992, and 1996) and came closest to the medal haul in Atlanta 1996, finishing in fourth place. After missing out his Sydney 2000 bid, he moved into the Star class and eventually partnered with Andreas Hanakamp to compete at his fourth Olympics in Athens 2004 and with Christian Nehammer at his fifth in Beijing 2008. Outside the Games, Spitzauer was deemed one of the world's most successful Finn sailors in the early to mid-1990s, receiving a complete set of medals with one in each color (gold, silver, and bronze) at the Finn Gold Cup and the Finn European Championships, respectively. Career=Early years Spitzauer made his first Austrian team in Seoul 1988, finishing fifteenth in the open Finn class with a net grade of 119.70. After his maiden Olympics, Spitzauer rose to prominence with his first-ever triumph at the 1989 Finn Europeans in Helsinki, Finland, eventually followed by his elated podium feat in the prestigious Finn Gold Cup three years later. At his succeeding Games in Barcelona 1992, Spitzauer improved upon his feat from Seoul to score a sensational top-eight mark in his pet class with 79.4 net points. Spitzauer reached the peak of his sailing career in the 1995 season by narrowly overhauling Sweden's Fredrik Lööf for the Finn Gold Cup title in Melbourne. A potential gold medal favorite in Atlanta 1996, however, he slipped out of the podium by the smallest margin behind the Netherlands' Roy Heiner. Transition Spitzauer continued to sail the Finn in the late 1990s, but he took the helm of a threesome Soling boat for the remaining portion of the quadrennial cycle. His bid for Sydney 2000 was cut short, when he lost the selection trials. Taking a year off to reassess other sailing options, Spitzauer decided to move into the Star class and eventually partnered with Andreas Hanakamp in the lead-up to his fourth Olympic trip. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Spitzauer and crew member Hanakamp struggled to chase the world's top sailing crews in the Star class under breezy conditions, before bouncing back to score a couple of top-five marks towards the final stretch. Unable to sail towards the front after eleven races, the Austrian pair accumulated a net grade of 97 for a lowly thirteenth overall out of seventeen registered crews. Dissatisfied with the Athens 2004 outcome, Spitzauer shelved his retirement plans to pair up with the nine-time legend Hubert Raudaschl for his next Olympiad, but perpetual training and campaigning lost some sailing allure for the latter. He requested the 32-year-old Christian Nehammer to join him in a Star campaign, beginning with the 2006 ISAF World Cup series in Miami. Soon, the new Austrian duo recorded a string of top-ten marks at various international regattas within the quadrennial cycle, including the Kiel Week and the Bacardi Cup. After missing the Olympic cut at the Worlds in 2007, Spitzauer and crewman Nehammer rebounded from their flimsy outcome in Cascais to punch the last of the four remaining tickets vying for qualification with a successful top 16 finish at the class-associated Worlds in Miami. Spitzauer served as the country's sailing team captain at his fifth and final Games in Beijing 2008, teaming with the rookie Nehammer in the Star class. There, the Austrian duo posted a triad of top-six marks throughout the ten-race course, but a disastrous feat on the last leg slipped their chances away from the medal round to the twelfth overall spot with 87 net points.

Founded at the beginning of the 12th century by Robert of Arbrissel, it was for most of its history a convent belonging to the Order of Fontevraud. The original monastic structures were officially designated as French historic monuments on March 27, 1926. Foundation When Robert of Arbrissel established the Abbey of Fontevraud and the Fontevriste Rule, approved by Pope Calixtus II in 1119, Orsan was still a swampy and uncultivated place. The land is believed to have been donated by the Lord of Châteaumeillant. In the 10 years following his arrival in Berry, Robert of Arbrissel founded 18 priories, all attached to Fontevraud, including that of Orsan in 1107. The nuns were first installed in a wooden structure. Robert of Arbrissel, a tireless evangelist, immediately resumed his travels, entrusting Orsan to the first prioress, Agnes de Châteaumeillant, under the administration of the Archbishop of Bourges. The Priory prospered soon after being built, its church was completed in 1113. The lords of the region took the Priory under their protection. In competition with other monasteries in the region, Orsan soon found itself on trial. Robert of Arbrissel returned to settle these disputes in 1116, and it was probably at this time that the founder died. He bequeathed his heart to Orsan and the rest of his body to Fontevraud. The Archbishop of Bourges, who died a few years later, gave his country house to the Priory and asked to be buried near the heart of Robert of Arbrissel. Orsan experienced continued prosperity for the next five hundred years. As the burial place of the heart of Robert of Arbrissel, it became a site of pilgrimage for Catholics who attributed miracles to this holy relic. Orsan was generously patronized, thus allowing for its land holdings to be enlarged under management of the prioresses. Decline The Priory of Orsan was able to escape danger in the Hundred Years War, but experienced considerable setbacks during the French Wars of Religion. In 1569, the buildings were looted and burned. The nuns fled to the castle of Châtelet and returned a year later, noting the disappearance of many documents. Farmers and tenants then refused to pay rent. Despite this, the buildings were rebuilt in 1596, owing to the patronage of Éléonore de Bourbon, Abbess of Fontevraud. The fence and the main gate were completed in the 18th century. Alas, the Priory and its lands were eventually sold during the French Revolution and used continuously for farming until 1989. Rebirth In 1990, only four large buildings remained from the Priory of Orsan, enclosing a disused farmyard where in the 1950s, a chicken coop, pigsty, and metal shed had been erected. The church, the cloisters, and the mill had disappeared, their stones repurposed for agricultural constructions. That year, Patrice Taravella and Sonia Lesot, architects looking for a building to renovate, discovered Orsan. The walls were dilapidated, the rooves worn, the doors without keys, old agricultural machinery strewn about the barns and courtyard. They purchased the Priory and forty hectares of adjacent woods and meadows, and began renovations in 1991. The buildings have been listed since 1926 in the Supplementary Inventory of Historic Monuments. An architect from Bâtiments de France intervened on behalf of the restoration efforts, and national and regional grants were presented to aid in preservation. The walls were consolidated, the windows replaced and, facing a bare courtyard, the idea of creating gardens appeared. It was not a question of reconstructing gardens in the same way, since there were no original plans, but rather of evoking Medieval monastic gardens in general. The gardens were created in 1992, and opened to the public in 1994. The buildings were then fitted to accommodate the public: first a boutique-bookshop, then a restaurant-tearoom in 1998, finally in 2001, six hotel rooms. Gardens The gardens of the Priory of Orsan were created by two architects, Sonia Lesot and Patrice Taravella, and maintained by the master gardener Gilles Guillot. In the Middle Ages, the monastery garden was meant to nourish the body and mind, and provide the tranquility necessary for religious contemplation. Inspired by biblical gardens, they included at least four types of garden: the potager, the herbarium for medicinal plants, the orchard-cemetery, and the cloister garden. The fence, separating wilderness from civilized life, the fountain, representing the four rivers of Paradise and the courtyard, lawn dotted with flowers and decorated with benches of greenery, arbors and pergolas, are other essential elements of Medieval gardens. The design of the Orsan gardens thus adheres to three principles: function, symbolism, and harmony. In the beginning, only a single green enclosure with a fountain at its center was intended for the reconstruction. All of the adjacent gardens: the simple ones, the orchards, the allée of berry fruits, the labyrinth, the rose garden (or \\"Garden of Mary\\"), the raised vegetable garden, the parterre, the pergolas, and the grove of olive trees were erected around this original enclosure.

After enrolling on a geography degree at the University of Birmingham, she assisted her husband Sydney Checkland in forming the University of Glasgow's School of Economic History and the couple edited a republication of the English Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 and she worked alone in researching the Scottish Poor Laws. As associate director of 19th-century East Asians, Checkland wrote five entries for Oxford University Press' Dictionary of National Biography. Biography=Early life Checkland was born at 20 Lyndhurst Avenue in the Newcastle upon Tyne suburb of Jesmond on 6 June 1920. She was the only daughter of the process engraver's traveller and former Royal Navy cook Robert Fraser Anthony and the housewife Edith Anthony, née Philipson. As the Great Depression affected the country, the family relocated to Birmingham, to allow her father to seek employment. Checkland was taught at a local school, and became head girl. She attained a good academic performance, and enrolled on a geography degree at the University of Birmingham in 1938, becoming the first member of her family to have a tertiary education. Checkland was keen in student affairs at the university. Career She married the economics student Sydney Checkland on 11 September 1942 and had five children with him. Checkland cared for her husband while he was recovering from injuries sustained in the Falaise Pocket during the Normandy landings. From 1957 to 1982, she worked in partnership with her husband in forming University of Glasgow's School of Economic History and contacted faculty and senior students. Checkland arranged and managed her husband's working day, was influential in employing its inaugural departmental secretary. and worked extensively socially and academically with the university. She got involved in collecting and preserving the destruction of business records of financially insecure Scottish companies. Checkland her family helped to shelter Hungarian and later Chilean refugees escaping the Presidency of Salvador Allende. In 1974, she and her husband edited a republication of the English Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, followed by research on the Scottish Poor Laws. Checkland and Bob Cage wrote about the St John's poor relief experiment brought about by Thomas Chalmers in Glasgow from 1819 to 1823. The publication of her first book, Philanthropy in Victorian Scotland – Social Welfare and the Voluntary Principle, came in 1980. The book earned Checkland the Scottish Arts Council Book Award. Two years later, she and Margaret Lamb co-wrote their joint study Health Care and Social History, the Glasgow Case, and Industry and Ethos Scotland, 1832-1914 with her husband in 1984. Checkland did not collaborate academically further with her husband after his death in 1986. She learnt she could find solace and happiness in researching and writing, and specalised on post-19th century British-Japanese cultural, economic and social relations. In 1989, Checkland's book, Britain's Encounter with Meiji Japan, 1868–1912, studied how Japan sent their finest citizens to learn manufacturing abilities. This was followed by the publication of Humanitarianism and the Emperor's Japan, 1877–1977 in 1993, which examines the good and poor behaviour of Japanese soldiers towards prisoners of war in 20th century warfare. Checkland, Shizuya Nishimura and Norio Tamaki co-edited the book Pacific Banking 1859-1959: East Meets West in 1994, and authored Isabella Bird and 'a Woman's Right to Do what She Can Do Well two years later. Her 1998 publication, Japanese Whisky, Scotch Blend: Masataka Taketsuru, the Japanese Whisky King and Rita, His Scotch Wife, attracted press coverage in both Japan and the United Kingdom. It discusses how Masataka Taketsuru established the Nikka whisky distillery in 1934 after visiting Glasgow from Hokkaido to learn how to distil. The final book Checkland wrote was Building Cultural Bridges in 2003, which talks about the exchanging of artistic influences between Japan and the United Kingdom. Outside of her research, she was a four-time visiting professor at Keio University in Tokyo, and, as associate editor for 19th- century East Asians, wrote five biographies for Oxford University Press' Dictionary of National Biography. Personal life On 8 September 2004, Checkland died of heart failure while residing with one of her children in Swansea. She predeceased all five of her children. Personality and legacy The obituarist for The Times wrote Checkland sought for formality in relationships and was regularly addressed not by her forename but \\"Mrs. Checkland\\". In April 2001, the Japan Society presented her their annual award in recognition of her \\"contributions to Anglo-Japanese relations\\". The Checkland Memorial Fund, which was named after the historian, provides postgraduates researching economic and social history in Scottish universities with financial support. The University of Glasgow Archive Services holds a collection related to Checkland. They include her personal papers and photographs relating to her work.

The mission of the USMRR was to rebuild the railroad supply lines into Chattanooga from Nashville and Knoxville.McCallum's strategy was to rebuild the rail lines into Nashville and then rebuild the lines into Chattanooga. This meant rebuilding the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad from Nashville to Stevenson, Alabama, the Central Alabama railroad to Decatur, Alabama Memphis and Charleston Railroad, and the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad that ran between Chattanooga and Knoxville. The segment of the M&C; railroad between Bridgeport, Alabama and Chatanooga had suffered much damage at the hands of the retreating Confederates, two major bridges had been destroyed, the first over 1,500 foot in length at the Tennessee River and the second at 800 feet and 95 feet high at Running Water, Tennessee.

As fast as the Union army occupied new territory, the railroads had to be reconstructed and opened for use, and they were always subject to constant guerrilla raids. Frequently the army was driven back and the line was lost, which made necessary a second rebuilding after the next advance. An example of this was the Buell campaign of 1863 the road was opened as far as Stevenson, Alabama but it was lost when Buell retreated in the late fall. It was recaptured by Rosecrans late in 1863 and was rebuilt to Chattanooga. These railroads furnished all the supplies to the Union armies in the field. The problem was that the railroad lines were one of the few in the Confederacy with U rail laid on longitudinal stingers with no ballast on the roadbed.

Wright organized the construction corps into six divisions one of which he commanded in Virginia at Acquia creek. Three new divisions were to be mobilized to support the railroad rebuilding work assigned to Wright who now commanded almost six thousand men. The Corps headquarters was the residence of the division engineer and his assistants. Each division had subdivisions for bridges and track. McCallum's objective was to mobilize a military railroad to supply Sherman's Atlanta campaign in 1864 using 200 locomotives and 3,000 pieces of rolling stock. The Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad was the primary supply line for the Atlanta campaign. Wright replaced the old \\"U\\" rail with new \\"T\\" rail. Often raids forced Wright to rebuild bridges several times, one had to be rebuilt five times. Just prior to Sherman starting his campaign, 130 freight cars a day arrived in Chattanooga carrying food, ammunition, and supplies only; troops and livestock were marched in. The Atlanta campaign saw the railroad being used for hospital trains, eight cars in each, carrying as many as three hundred passengers. Sherman's campaign depended on bringing supplies over railroad lines maintained by Wright's construction corps. This four hundred and seventy-mile rail link was composed of three railroads, the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and the Western and Atlantic Railroad. Sherman noted this contribution when he said that this single rail line \\"supplied an army of 100,000 men and 35,000 horses for a period of 196 days\\" in the 1864 campaign. Wright's task in rebuilding the Western and Atlantic Railroad was the most difficult, constructing eleven bridges on the line including the eight hundred foot Chattahoochee River bridge in just six days.Sherman, W. T. (William Tecumseh). (1876). Memoirs of General William T. Sherman. New York: D. Appleton. Wright rebuilt the Oostenaula River bridge in seventy-two hours and started the rebuild while the bridge was still burning. He rebuilt the 600-foot bridge over the Etowah River in five days. Much of this work was supervised by Eben C. Smeed, one of Herman Haupt's assistants from Virginia. =Savannah Campaign= At the close of 1864, Wright was ordered by General Sherman to Savannah, where he arrived with his construction corps of 1,200 men on January 13th, 1865, and was put in charge of the military railroad work in that vicinity. He was present with General Sherman at the time of the negotiations with General Johnston, which closed the war. Wright was replaced by Col Joseph Fulton Boyd (1832-1907) on July 1st, 1865. Eben C. Smeed remained engineer of repairs. Wright left the Army in 1866 as chief engineer of military railroads of the Division of the Mississippi. Postbellum career After the war, Wright resumed his involvement in the railroad industry. Kansas Pacific Railway In 1866, Wright left the Military Railroad Construction Corps and became general superintendent and chief engineer of the Kansas Pacific Railway Company then known as the Union Pacific railway-Eastern Division, with headquarters at Wyandotte, Kansas part of present-day Kansas City, Kansas. He was to survey routes for a proposed extension to the Pacific coast. The US Congress had approved and Act on July 3, 1866, authorizing the railway to extend the railroad westward along the Smoky Hill River to Denver, Colorado. The Act also required the railroad to join the Union Pacific railroad no more than fifty miles west of Denver, a distance of 394 miles. The railroad was completed by the end of 1867.Crippen, Waldo.

He is Chief of Staff and Associate Professor of Neurology at Columbia University.  Early life and education  Williams was born prematurely and spent the first years of his life in hospital. As a teenager, Williams attended a boarding school in the United Kingdom. Williams trained in medicine in the University of Lagos. It was in Lagos that he first became interested in public health, recognising how many people were dying from preventable diseases. In an interview with the American Heart Association, Williams said that he felt \\"too African in England, and too English in Africa,\\", so instead moved to the United States. He completed his specialist training in neurology at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. It was whilst working at the Harlem Hospital Center that he recognised the same public health disconnect that he had seen in Lagos. He earned a Master's of Public Health in 2004.  Research and career  After earning his graduate degree, Williams started working with the National Stroke Association (NSA) and community groups in Harlem with whom he looked to establish trusted, evidence-based public health awareness programmes. With the support from the NSA, Williams researched the effectiveness of teaching children about neurological conditions through hip hop music. Whilst working at the Harlem Hospital Center Williams established the Stroke Center of Excellence. Williams founded the Hip Hop Stroke programme, a National Institutes of Health funded initiative which developed a school-based stroke education programme to teach children about stroke. The school programme reached 12,000 children. In 2014, Williams and hip hop pioneer Doug E. Fresh launched Hip-Hop Public Health, a non-profit organisation that looks to educate people about public health issues through the lens of public health. Hip-Hop Public Health was offered to schools and hospitals around New York state. As part of this work, Williams devised videos, cartoons and a novel stroke video game to teach school students from minority backgrounds about the risks of stroke. After the training sessions, 60% of the children had perfect scores in a stroke perception test. Williams also produced Songs for a Healthier America, an album that aimed to amplify the benefits of healthier child nutritional and exercise choices. Alongside his academic research, Williams looks to develop medical education programmes to promote equity and inclusion in academic medicine. During the COVID-19 pandemic Williams joined Doug E. Fresh to create a series of videos to encourage young people to wash their hands for twenty seconds or more.  Awards and honours  Williams has won several awards for his research and advocacy. In 2008 he was awarded the NAACP Community Service Award. He was selected by The Root as one of the United States' most influential African-Americans in 2012. That same year he was recognized by Fast Company Magazine as the 65th most creative person in business. He was awarded the European Stroke Research Foundation Investigator award in 2017 in Berlin. In 2018 he was honoured by the American Heart Association's Northeast Cerebrovascular Consortium for his work on stroke disparities in underserved communities.

Flynn died from a gunshot wound. Hallock claims that an African-American man named Crosley Green was responsible for Flynn's death. Green was found guilty of Flynn's murder and placed on Death row. He was eventually removed from death row. However, he still remains in prison. Green has repeatedly declared his innocence. In the years since Green's conviction further investigations and trials have taken place.  Background  Before the killing, Flynn had just exited a relationship with Kim Hollack. Hollack was hurt by the split. Flynn was also living with his parents and was in a relationship. Green was a minor drug dealer who had just been recently released from Madison Correctional Institution. He was also the carer for his family, after his parents died.  Killing  On April 3, 1989, around 10:00, Hallock encoutered Charles Flynn at her house. They would later drive to a park in Mims, Florida where they would smoke marijuana and have sex. Later at the local baseball field, Holder Park, Hallock and Flynn were sitting in his truck when Hallock notified Flynn of Crosley Green's presence to which he rolled up the windows. Green was armed at the time. Hallock would also take out the gun in the glove carpartment and place it near her. Green then reportedly tied Flynn's hands with a shoelace, forced Hallock to give him money and drove them to a Florida citrus grove, all while holding a gun on Hallock and Flynn. Hallock stated that they were robbed at 11:00 and taken to the grove in Flynn's truck at 12:10. Beforehand Flynn attempted to plead with Green asking that he let Hallock go. While driving Green forced them to keep their heads down. While crouching Hallock attempted to untie Flynn's restraints. When at the grove Green removed Hallock from the truck and verbarly abused her; such as calling her slut. Flynn, hands still tied, retrieved the gun from the car and fired \\"five or six gunshots,\\" Hallock, unaware if Flynn shot Green, fled the scene; driving three miles, past a hospital, a pay phone, the house she shared with her parents and other houses before arriving to the house of a friend of Flynn's—David Stroup—to call for help.  911 call and police investigation  Around 40 minutes after fleeing the scene, Hallock called the police at 01:13. The officers dispatched to the scene were Brevard County sergeant and deputy: Diane Clarke and Mark Rixey. Due to the unclear directions given by Hallock it took them 30 minutes to find Flynn and initially went to the wrong location. Clarke, therefore, sent another deputy to gain relevant information from her, however, she was uncooperative. Upon arriving at the grove, Clarke and Rixey found Flynn; hands tied with a single gunshot to the chest. The first words he said to them were \\"Get me outta here. I wanna go home.\\" At no point did he mention a robbery or an assailant. During two separate occasions Flynn stopped breathing while they waited for an ambulance. Clarke, in response, tried to resuscitate him. Flynn died before the ambulance arrived. Flynn's parents soon arrived at the scene however police didn't let them interfere. At the scene, fingerprints belonging to Hallock and Flynn were discovered, the only gun found was the one belonging to Flynn, no gunshot residue was seen on Flynn's hands and the only bullet found was the one that killed him. Which was determined to have originated from his own gun.  Arrest, trials and investigations = Police search for suspect and arrest  A photo of the lineup shown to Hallock. Green's photo is number 2. After Hallock gave a recorded statement to police in which she identified the assailant as a black man and after receiving a tip from a friend of Flynn's—Tim Curtis—the police's prime suspect became Green. Curtis would later admit to lying about knowing Green to be the killer. Hallock was later shown a photo lineup of six photos (Green included). Green's photo was deliberately smaller and darker than the other pictures and positioned so \\"that your eyes are normally drawn to are right in the middle.\\" Despite Hallock only being \\"pretty sure\\" Green was the suspect she managed to identify him. Green was arrested on June 8, 1989 and charged with kidnapping, robbery and murder.  Initial trial: 1989-1990  During the trial, which took place from August to September 1989, prosecutors displayed shop prints which they attributed to Green. Assistant State's Attorney Christopher White who put forward the claim, stated that a police dog alerted them of the scent of those prints and they tracked that scent to the vicinity of a house where Crosley Green sometimes stayed. A police crime scene video of the investigation conflicted with this claim. White could not produce any evidence of these claims and no fingerprints, fibres, hair or blood—originating from Green—were found at the scene. The shoeprints were ultimately found to not belong to Green as they were one size too large and that the print didn't match the actual shoe tread found at the scene. It would later be revealed that White intentionally withheld evidence. Later on in the trial, prosecutors put forward three witnesses who claimed Crosley had confessed to them. One of the witnesses was his own sister, Shelia Green. Sheila would later revoke her statement. Claiming she was pressured to commit perjury by police and if she didn't she would never see her children again. The other witness shared similar stories. One witnesses in support of Green was put forward. Green was offered a plea deal in which he would admit guilt and receive no more than 22 years. He refused to take the deal asserting that he did not kill Charles Flynn. On September 5, 1990, After 3 hours of contemplation, the all-white jury found Green guilty offirst-degree murder and he was sentenced to death. In 2019 the U.S. Middle District Court of Florida deemed this ruling to be unconstitutional.  Proposed second trial: 1993-1994  In April 1993, Defense attorney Rob Parker filed a motion for a new trial to place on the grounds that Hallock was doubtful over Green being the perpetrator. This motion was denied. And Green's conviction was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court in 1994.  Private investigation: 1999  In the early summer of 1999, Chicago investigator Paul Ciolino and four other investigators began to review the case (without pay) and interview witnesses, jurors and others connected to the case, per request of Nan Webb, a Viera housewife and anti- dealth penalty activist. They had previously made contact with Webb in 1996. Ciolino would meet with Assistant State's Attorney Christopher White and Brevard County Sheriff Phil Williams to discuss the case and aid in the investigation. Ciolino and the investigators would discover evidence discounting the shoeprints and witness testimonies as well as learning that the truck, Green reportedly hijacked was a manual stick which Green could not drive. Due to this evidence they were able to propose a new trial. Which State Attorney Norman Wolfinger allowed. It, however, seems that this trial did not go through.  State investigation: 2000  In 2000 the state of Florida conducted their own investigation. In the investigation, they tested new items for the possibility of DNA. A report from CBS in the same year stated that no DNA evidence had been found that connected Green to the murder. Later reports however contradict this. Due to the possibility of the evidence belonging to Green's genetic family. Green's brother O'Connor who had been in the truck, according to Tim Curtis, has been suggested as to who the evidence belongs to.  Continued appeals: 2002-2011  In 2002 Green's attorneys continued to appeal his case. Hoping to win a new trial. In 2003 Green was given a hearing by Florida Judge Bruce Jacobus. In 2005 Green's death sentence was thrown out. This appeal was challenged by the Florida Supreme Court in June 2007. In October of that year, the Florida Supreme Court upheld Green's conviction but stated that he should, however, be resentenced. Green received a life sentence the following year. In 2010 Green's attorneys again petitioned for a new trial. This petition was ultimately denied in 2011. Despite two new alibi witnesses being brought forward.  Third trial: 2016-2019  In January 2016 a petition for a new trial was declined due to allegedly missing a deadline. Later that year Green's attorneys filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that there existed evidence of prosecutorial misconduct. U.S. District Judge Roy Dalton Jr., denied the claim saying it is time-barred. In 2017, Green's attorneys win an appeal with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals stating that Dalton's ruling was illegitimate because of a technicality. In 2018 Green was given a new trial due to prosecutor Christopher White withholding evidence from Green's main attorneys. The trial was however appealed by the State of Florida and ultimately halted. In December 2019, Florida Today reported that Green had won a new trial. They later reported that this trial was appealed.  2020 ruling  On March 12, 2020, Green's and state attorneys discussed with the US Court of Appeals if the lower court order for a new trial will be upheld. Green's case is expected to be reviewed by a panel of the 11th Circuit, U. S. Court of Appeals sometime in late 2020.  Claims of innocence  Since his arrest, Green has repeatedly declared his innocence. Upon being questioned by police for the murder of Flynn. Green stated that watched a baseball game at Holder Park and was at his girlfriend's house and a party on the night in question. Green again restated his innocence in interviews conduct by CBS News in 2015 and 2020. Since his conviction Green's Attorney's have found alibi witnesses willing to corroborate Green's story. Assistant State's Attorney Christopher White however raised questions of their credibility. In 2020 Defense attorney Jeane Thomas stated that there exists at least eight alibi witnesses who can support Green being at the party. Many other people have come out in support of green as well. Paul Ciolino, a private investigator hired to prove Green's innocence, believes that he is, in fact, innocent and that \\"Crosley Green is systematic of the problem we have with the death penalty with this country\\" Tim Curtis who first accused Green of being the killer (however would go back on this statement) would change his mind of Green's supposed guilt. Believing him to be innocent. Private detective Joe Moura, also believes Green to be innocent. Stating that there is no evidence to tie Green to the murder. Seth Miller who leads the Innocence Project of Florida has stated that there is \\"clear evidence of [Green's] innocence,\\" Sergeant. J. Wallace of Hardee Correctional Institution while not calling Green innocent did state that he doesn't think \\"Mr. Green poses any threat to society,\\" Green's remaining family has come out in support of him.  Inconsistencies in the proposed story  Many questions have arisen regarding the story put forward by police, mostly regarding Green's ability to drive the car while holding Hallock and Flynn at gunpoint. Ciolino further elaborated on this point by saying: Curtis shared a similar sentiment, saying that \\"You cannot get in that truck and take off without it stalling,\\" and that \\"You had to grab the truck literally to climb up in it. It wasn't like an automobile. You had to open the door and climb up in it. You couldn't do it without putting your hands on the truck. Impossible.\\" During Ciolino's investigation he raised more questions such as \\"How could you come out of this truck with your hands tied behind your backfiring a weapon,\\" Rob Parker, Green's defence attorney also questioned how Hallock would be able to identify Green when the scene was pitch black and Hallock saw him for no more than 30 seconds. The story which Hallock gave to police had several inconsistencies and subsequent alterations to it. In her statement to police, Hallock described Green as having long, Jheri-curled hair which covered his ears. Green at the at time had a buzz cut. She described the gun allegedly used by Green as a semi-automatic despite no shell casing being found at the scene. She reported that Green made her tie Flynn's hands however later claimed he did the tying. She reported hearing five to six gunshots however only the one bullet was found. = Suspicion over Kim Hallock = Despite never being a suspect herself and as such never going through procedures such as being checked for gunshot residue, photographed and having her clothes collected. The first responders, (Diane Clarke and Mark Rixey) believe her to be responsible for Flynn's death. Clarke and Rixely's belief was based upon, Hallock's behaviour after the shooting, the lack of physical evidence tying Green to the crime scene, the only bullet found at the scene and Flynn's comments upon their arrival. Assistant State's Attorney Christopher White denied these claims but admits that further examination could have been done. Alma Jean Blouse, one of the jurors, admits that in the years after the trial she has had doubts, suspecting that Hallock's testimony was \\"a made-up story.\\" Both White and Clarke have suggested that possibility of the shooting being an accident done by Hallock.

Early life  Goldston grew up in Heston, a suburb in Hounslow, West London. His mother was a professional movie and TV extra. He recalls as a child being taken to a shooting for a James Bond film, in which he made an appearance.  Early career  Goldston was the first in his family to go university when he studied philosophy, politics and economics at Jesus College, Oxford. He then attended the Cardiff School of Journalism where he was trained by academics including British newspaper editor Sir David English, graduating in 1991 with a PgDip Journalism qualification. He began his career during work experience at the Richmond and Twickenham Times, followed by roles at The Surrey Herald and Legal Business.  Broadcast journalism  His first job in broadcast journalism was at the BBC where he began on programmes including The Money Programme, Newsnight and Panorama. Goldston worked as an international correspondent for the BBC, and was responsible for reporting at the time of the end of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, during the start of the war in Kosovo, and on the Clinton Impeachment.  Television production  In 1999 he moved to commercial broadcaster ITV and helped launch the flagship current affairs programme Tonight with Trevor McDonald. He became the programme's executive producer in 2002 and remained there until 2004. The show became \\"Britain’s most watched current affairs program.\\" Goldston secured significant interviews while at Tonight, including: * Living With Michael Jackson in which the singer confessed to sharing a bed with young boys. The report was picked up by his current organisation ABC News in the United States and reached 27 million viewers. Host Martin Bashir went on to testify in Jackson's second trial for child molestation. * Shock and Awe, live coverage anchored from Kuwait and Baghdad of the Iraq War. * Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Major Fraud, an investigation into Charles Ingram who in 2004 was convicted for cheating the popular UK game show. The Millionaire scandal was in 2020 picked up by ITV to become a major drama serial entitled Quiz. Tonight received three Royal Television Society awards in five years during Goldston's tenure.  ABC News career = 20/20 (2004–2005)  Goldston departed ITV and moved to the US in 2004 to become a Senior Producer at ABC News in New York, at the time accompanied by his friend and fellow contributor at ITV Bashir, with whom they worked on 20/20. In November 2005 the duo broadcast a report into the BALCO scandal, obtaining a rare interview with the company's founder Victor Conte who had been indicted by a federal grand jury in February 2004. Conte was charged with supplying drugs to 27 high-profile athletes including Barry Bonds and Marion Jones. The investigation led to the charging of Dwain Chambers, Tim Montgomery, and a number of other high-profile American Olympians.  Nightline (2005–2011)  In 2005 Goldston became first British executive producer of prime time broadcast Nightline under its then host Ted Koppel. The broadcast was \\"on the verge of cancellation\\" and courting David Letterman as a potential new host when Goldston took over. He reformed the programme by removing the \\"single-anchor, single-topic format\\" and brought in a three-person team of Bashir, Cynthia McFadden, and Terry Moran. He reportedly faced initial criticism from supporters of Koppel within ABC who felt in replacing previous producer Tom Bettag, Goldston was dismantling the long running format of the programme, however the audience quickly gained traction, moving up 14% among 25–54-year olds in the \\"demo\\", while competitor programmes like the Tonight Show With Jay Leno and the Late Show With David Letterman took a hit in the ratings.  Good Morning America (2011–2014) and SVP  In 2011 he took over Good Morning America, which at the time had spent years behind its arch rival Today. Within a year in the role, the broadcast overtook the NBC production to claim top spot among audiences. He became senior vice president (SVP) for content and development at ABC News in 2012.  President of ABC News (2014–present)  In April 2014 Goldston became the President of ABC News, reaching the role after just ten years at the network. He replaced Ben Sherwood, who was promoted to a senior role within Disney. He was at that point one of two Britons in charge of the Big Three television networks in the US, alongside Deborah Turness who was until 2017 the President of NBC News. At the time he also formed a British executive duo at ABC, alongside ABC Entertainment president (and BBC alum) Paul Lee. At the time of his appointment, Goldston was labelled as having \\"something of a Midas touch\\" in the press after taking each broadcast he led (Nightline, GMA, and This Week) to the top spot for viewership, and with GMA enjoying \\"its best performance in 20 years.\\" In 2015 he travelled to the Vatican to lead on the network's interview with Pope Francis, which was anchored by David Muir. In 2019 he was one of 170 guests at the state banquet during the 2019 visit to the United Kingdom by President Trump, despite his network being described by Trump as being \\"fake news.\\" In 2016 a letter was written to Goldston by journalists who were requesting reforms to improve the treatment of black candidates in hiring decisions. HuffPost sources described that Senior Vice President for Talent and Business at ABC Barbara Fedida intervened to join a meeting on the topic, a meeting which the group went on to describe as \\"tense\\". Mara Schiavocampo later accused Fedida of \\"racial discrimination\\", but later agreed a financial settlement including \\"a nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreement.\\" In June 2020 Goldston placed Fedida, who first joined the company in 1989, on \\"administrative leave\\" after a HuffPost report which alleged an \\"extensive history\\" of \\"insensitive and racist remarks.\\" In response to her suspension Fedida released a statement through her attorney describing the accusations as \\"heartbreaking and incredibly misleading.\\" She was fired on 21 July 2020.

It is distributed across disjunct areas in the southern Atlantics Forests of Brazil, the Guiana shield in Venezuela, the Andean regions of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It thrives in karst areas, and in humid, premontane or montane forests from sea level to 2,000 m. The name Manekia is a taxonomic anagram derived from the name of the genus Ekmania. The latter name is a taxonomic patronym honoring the Swedish botanist Erik Leonard Ekman.  Description  Manekia members are characterized by scandent or lianescent habits and by short sympodial branches holding the spikes. Flowers possess four stamens, four-carpellate pistils with 4−5 stigmas. Berries are fully or partially immersed in the rachis. When compared to other Piperaceae genera, the ecology of Manekia appears rather distinct, with plants invading forest litter, forming large mats of reptant stems, and eventually colonizing nearby phorophytes, reaching the canopy, and often forming large masses on the top before blooming.  Phylogeny  Manekia is the sister group to Zippelia, and both genera are sister to a clade including Piper and Peperomia.

One of the Lindsay of Evelix family, he succeeded to the baronetcy upon the death of his father, Sir Alexander Lindsay, in 1762. He began his career in the 3rd Foot Guards; in 1776, he became colonel of the 59th Foot, then major-general in 1778. Promoted lieutenant-general in 1779, during the Anglo-French War (1778–1783), he commanded the defences of Plymouth at the time of the Franco-Spanish Armada. He resigned his position in early 1780, which ended his active service, his promotion to General in 1796 being a function of time served. He died in Cavendish Square, London, on 6 March 1797.  Early life  Miniature of Lindsay by Gervase Spencer David Lindsay was born circa 1732 to Sir Alexander Lindsay, the third of the Lindsay of Evelix baronets of Scotland, and Amelia née Murray. In 1752 he cut off ties with his sister, Margaret Lindsay after she eloped with the painter Allan Ramsay, whom the Lindsays considered socially inferior. Because of the feud David Lindsay deliberately patronised Ramsay's rival Sir Joshua Reynolds. Lindsay was only reconciled with Margaret after the death of their father on 6 May 1762, after which David became the fourth baronet Evelick.  Military career  Lindsay served as Custos Brevium of the Court of King's Bench and from 1758 to 1776 was captain of a company of the 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards, a traditionally Scottish unit. As was the tradition, he continued to receive advancement in army rank, though he remained nominally a guards captain, and on 30 January 1776, he was appointed colonel of the 59th Foot. Previously stationed in Boston, Massachusetts, the 59th suffered heavy losses when the American War of Independence began. The survivors were posted to other units, and its officers returned to England in 1776 to reform the regiment. On 6 September 1777, Lindsay was promoted major-general, shortly before the Anglo-French War began in June 1778. In October 1778, he was commanding troops based at Warley, established as a safeguard against French invasion, when the camp was inspected by George III. Appointed lieutenant-general on 27 February 1779, on 29 May he was given command of Plymouth during a possible invasion associated with the Armada of 1779. He seems to have viewed the appointment with some despair and remained in London for a month, attempting to secure a meeting with Lord Amherst, commander-in-chief of the forces. Upon arriving in Plymouth, Lindsay lamented his lack of troops and lack of co-operation from the Board of Ordnance; although Amherst sympathised, he noted troops were thinly stretched across the entire coastline. Lindsay sought to find volunteers for the defence of the city and, following a public subscription that raised £1,000 for the purpose, issued 2,520 stands of arms to volunteers by 25 August – and noted that he had 20,000 men standing by. Lindsay feared being made a scapegoat for the chaotic defensive measures, and frequently requested more men, while claiming the efforts he expended made him ill with fatigue. Later in the year Lindsay wrote that he believed he had brought about a significant improvement in defences and had the support of the distinguished general Charles Grey in the matter, but by 2 September had offered his resignation. The Armada was badly affected by sickness, and returned to port in September, ending the possibility of invasion that year. In November John Robinson, the secretary to the Treasury, feared a parliamentary enquiry into defensive preparations against the Armada would call Lindsay to testify, who would reveal the unpreparedness of Plymouth for defence, and possibly cause the downfall of Lord North's government. The administration successfully blocked demands for an enquiry in November, and again the following April; during the debates, it was noted Lindsay had since resigned his appointment. This seems to have ended his active service, although he remained colonel of the 59th until his death; he was promoted general on 14 May 1796, a function of time served.  Personal life  Arms of the Lindsays of Evelix Lindsay was married to Susannah-Charlotte Long. They had six children, of which two, John and Susan, died in infancy. Their son William became ambassador to Venice and governor of Tobago but died before his father; another son, Charles became a naval officer. One daughter, Charlotte-Amelia, married the politician Thomas Steele and the other, Elizabeth, married Augustus Schultz. Lindsay died on 6 March 1797 and the baronetcy was inherited by Charles but, being childless, it became extinct upon his death by drowning in 1799. The Evelick estate was inherited by Charlotte-Amelia.

The Department of Archeology at the University of Jordan supervised excavation and excavation work at the site in 1995, and work is still ongoing to train students of the department in excavation and excavation work in the archaeological site, and methods for the detection, maintenance, restoration and documentation of monuments in an accurate scientific manner. During the excavations of the University of Jordan in 1996, a small church was found extending from east to west.

He is remembered to have contributed to the uniqueness of the Belgrade urban core. Biography Danilo Vladisavljević finished his elementary schooling in Donji Milanovac and Pančevo, gymnasium in Belgrade, and later went to study architecture in Munich in 1889. At the Munich Polytechnic, Vladisavlejvić enrolled in the course of the construction at \\"Hochbau-Abteilung\\", graduating in 1894. In 1895 he first began a collaboration with engineer Miloš Savčić, in whose office he worked until 1898 before being hired by the Ministry of War as an engineer and architect. That same year he became a member of the Association of Serbian Artists. In 1899, he married Ljubica Mesanović (the daughter of a famous Belgrade merchant Kosta Mesanović) with whom he had three children (two boys and a girl). Along with three other architects (Vladimir Petković, Branko Tanazević and Andra Stevanović), Vladisavljević took part in the \\"Fourth Art Exhibition\\" organized in Belgrade in 1912. At the exhibition, he displayed the project of a Military Hospital in Belgrade with a sketch of a barrack, and a project for a Surgical Pavilion. When World War I began, he sent his wife and children to Salonica. After suffering the Great Retreat across the Albanian mountains in late 1915, he joined his family in early 1916 in Salonica. Then, Vladisavljević sent his family to Nice while he went with the Serbian government to Corfu. In late 1917 he joined his family in Nice where he remained until 1918 when he was sent to Paris as an engineer and forensic expert of the Serbian government to ascertain the damages caused by the war. The consequences of the war left a significant impression on Vladisavljević. In 1921, he retired from the Ministry of War, though he continued his activity in the Association of Engineers and Architects of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Danilo Vladisavljević died on 5 January 1923. He was buried in the family tomb at Novo Groblje in Belgrade. Despite the premature death, he left an imposing opus of architectural works. Opus Among the many projects was his family house, built for himself and his wife Ljubica and their sons Lazar and Vladislav and daughter Bela at 57 Gospodar Jevremova Street. In terms of typology, the house belongs to corner buildings, with less prominent angles, almost square in plan. The facades, executed in the Art Nouveau style, with wrought-iron decoration, corresponded to the spirit of the time; new artistic trends started developing in Belgrade at the beginning of the 20th century. He, like many of his contemporaries in the profession, built various residential buildings for influential citizens and implemented pioneering urban projects in Belgrade and area, for example, the Military Hospital Complex in Vračar; facilities for military purposes such as the military barracks in Niš, Valjevo and Smederevska Palanka; and two hotels in the prestigious centre core of Belgrade – the \\"Hotel Splendid\\" and the \\"Hotel Union\\" which continue to be cultural and tourist landmarks there. Particularly fruitful was his collaboration with the engineer Miloš Savčić on multi-storey outlet buildings such as The Trade and Export Bank at Terazije 5, Vračar Savings Bank (ex-Premetna) at Kneza Mihaila 26http://beogradskonasledje.rs/kd/zavod/stari_grad/dom_vracarske_stedionice.html titre = Vračar Savings Bank House site = http://beogradskonasledje.rs éditeur = Site de l'Institut pour la protection du patrimoine de la ville de Belgrade consulté le = 28 juin 2012https://art.nouveau.world/danilo- vladisavljevicand the industrial complex of the Belgrade Slaughterhouse.

This central pressure diverges at the Buchdahl bound. In general relativity, Buchdahl's theorem, named after Hans Adolf Buchdahl, makes more precise the notion that there is a maximal sustainable density for ordinary gravitating matter. It gives an inequality between the mass and radius that must be satisfied for static, spherically symmetric matter configurations under certain conditions. In particular, for areal radius R, the mass M must satisfy where G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light. This inequality is often referred to as Buchdahl's bound. The bound has historically also been called Schwarzschild's limit as it was first noted by Karl Schwarzschild to exist in the special case of a constant density fluid. However, this terminology should not be confused with the Schwarzschild radius which is notably smaller than the radius at the Buchdahl bound.  Theorem  Given a static, spherically symmetric solution to the Einstein equations (without cosmological constant) with matter confined to areal radius R that behaves as a perfect fluid with a density that does not increase outwards. Assumes in addition that the density and pressure cannot be negative. The mass of this solution must satisfy For his proof of the theorem, Buchdahl uses the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation.  Significance  The Buchdahl theorem is useful when looking for alternatives to black holes. Such attempts are often inspired by the information paradox; a way to explain (part of) the dark matter; or to criticize that observations of black holes are based on excluding known astrophysical alternatives (such as neutron stars) rather than direct evidence. However, to provide a viable alternative it is sometimes needed that the object should be extremely compact and in particular violate the Buchdahl inequality. This implies that one of the assumptions of Buchdahl's theorem must be invalid. A classification scheme can be made based on which assumptions are violated.  Special Cases = Incompressible fluid  The special case of the incompressible fluid or constant density, \\\\rho(r) = \\\\rho_* for r < R , is a historically important example as, in 1916, Schwarzschild noted for the first time that the mass could not exceed the value \\\\frac{4 R c^2}{9G} for a given radius R or the central pressure would become infinite. It is also a particularly tractable example. Within the star one finds. and using the TOV-equation {\\\\sqrt{R^3-2GMr^2/c^2}-3R\\\\sqrt{R-2GM/c^2}} cellpadding border border colour = #ffffff background colour = #ffffff}} such that the central pressure, p(0) , diverges as R \\\\to 9GM/4c^2 .  Extensions  Extensions to Buchdahl's theorem generally either relax assumptions on the matter or on the symmetry of the problem. For instance, by introducing anistropic matter or rotation. In addition one can also consider analogues of Buchdahl's theorem in other theories of gravity  References  Category:Mathematical theorems Category:1959 in science Category:Energy (physics) ","title":"Buchdahl's theorem"},{"id":"64267609","text":"Carl Seemann (8 May 1910 − 26 November 1983) was a German church musician, pianist, piano teacher and director of the Musikhochschule Freiburg.  Life  Born in Bremen, after the Abitur Seemann initially vacillated between studying theology and music. He decided to study church music in Leipzig. His teachers were Karl Straube, Günther Ramin, Kurt Thomas and Carl Adolf Martienssen. After his exams, Seemann worked as organist in Flensburg and Verden. From 1935 he devoted himself mainly to his career as a pianist and to teaching - Seemann subsequently held professorships and master classes in Kiel, Strasbourg and Freiburg im Breisgau. From 1964 to 1974 he was head of the local state music academy. Many recordings, but especially the duo performances with the violinist Wolfgang Schneiderhan, made Seemann one of the greats of post-war German musical life. Nevertheless, public attention turned to the increasingly dominant Russian master pianists such as Emil Gilels, Vladimir Horowitz and Svjatoslav Richter. This was possibly also a consequence of Seemann's rather matter-of-fact style of interpretation, who refrained from virtuoso tricks. In 1999, the re-release of various Deutsche Grammophon recordings under the title The Legacy led to a kind of \\"Seemann's renaissance\\". In the supplement of the cassette the critic Joachim Kaiser, in whose book Great Pianists in our Time (Piper, Munich 1965; new edition 1996, ) Seemann did not appear, deals in an essay with Seemann's art. His assistant in Freiburg was . In his master class studied, among others, the conductor . Seemann's nephew heads the Klassik Stiftung Weimar. Seemann died in Freiburg im Breisgau at the age of 73.

N. Chapin; March 28, 1830 – August 20, 1901) was an American teacher, historian, author, newspaper publisher, suffragist, and activist. Chapin wrote mostly prose. She also wrote on Iowa history, and published several small books herself. While residing at Washington, D.C. for several winters, she wrote concerning society and fashionable Washington circles. In 1875, she began the publication of The Ladies Bureau, the first newspaper published west of Chicago by a woman. Chapin served as chair of the National Committee of the National Equal Rights Party. Early life and education Henrietta Maria (nickname, \\"Nettie\\") Skiff was born in Portage County, Ohio, March 28, 1830. Her parents were Stephen Skiff and Lucy Bierce Skiff. Stephen's parents were Jeremiah Skiff (b. 1770) and Esther Ayres Skiff (1770-1841). Chapin's siblings included Esther, Dimmis, Henry, Orin, and Nancy. Chapin came to Iowa with her father's family in August 1856, and settled in Malaka Township, Jasper County, Iowa, the township being named by Chapin and her father. Career=Iowa She taught school in Newton, Iowa in the fall of 1856 and the winter following, on going to the village to be examined for teaching, she got lost on the prairie in a snowstorm. Her horse, after wandering around for about four hours, with a little sled, finally came along to a fence along a farm. When she presented herself to the county examiner, he remarked, \\"I guess you will do; pretty plucky girl anyhow,\\" and she received her certificate. She helped organize the first society for the purpose of sending sanitary supplies to the Union soldiers in the field during the Civil War. In Newton, she was the first secretary of the local organization of the United States Sanitary Commission as early as the spring of 1862. She married Daniel Sanford of Edenville, later Rhodes, September 24, 1863. Daniel was a returned Californian. He lived at Des Moines, Iowa six months, and then moved to Marshalltown, December 1, 1864. They had two children, Philip Hathaway Sanford (1866-1867) and May Adalaide (b. 1868). Chapin served as president of the Marshall County Orphans' Home Society in 1865, when the county raised for the Orphans' Home state fair, held on the grounds of the high school. In the same year, she also lectured on women’s suffrage. In December 1867, Chapin made her first literary venture by publishing a history of Marshall County, Iowa. It was a small book and she paid for it. It had some errors and was written under trying circumstances, but a generous public forgave and it sold fairly well. In the fall of 1870, there was a good deal of discussion on woman's suffrage. A state convention was held at Mt. Pleasant, Iowa and Austin Perry Lowery of Des Moines represented Marshall County. He secured her election as one of the vice president of the state organization. She lectured some on the question and was severely ridiculed by the newspapers. Several women, friends of the movement, Mrs. Lot Thomas, Mrs. Ehwalan, Mrs. Rachel Brown, Mrs. Delos Arnold, and Mrs. Mary Holmes, called a meeting at Rice's Hall, which was then used for public purposed, ove rthe Whitton & Whithead store. She was made president of the society. In January 1873, Mr. Sanford died after an extended illness. In 1874, Chapin published a pamphlet entitled the \\"History of Jasper County\\" and in the city library of Des Moines, another pamphlet of 20 pages, \\"The History of Polk County\\". In October 1875, she began the publication of the first newspaper published west of Chicago by a woman. She called it The Ladies Bureau, and was afterwards changed in name to The Woman's Kingdom. California and Washington D.C. In the fall of 1877, Chapin went to California on account of her daughter's health, and in 1878, at Los Angeles, began the publication of the San Gabriel Valley News. After conducting that property at a loss for a time, she returned to Marshalltown, with barely . For years, she had been acting as special correspondent and during the years 1871–72, she had written up nine towns and villages in Iowa for outside newspapers. In August and September 1878, she was engaged as the private secretary of Matilda Fletcher, in Chicago, and acted as correspondent for Iowa newspapers. In December 1879, Chapin went to Washington D.C. and obtained a position in the fourth auditor's office, United States Department of the Treasury. During her stay in Washington, she corresponded to the Davenport Gazette, The Des Moines Register, Sioux City Journal, and Marshalltown Times. She also wrote for The Annals of Iowa. In 1882, at the James A. Garfield memorial fair in Washington D.C., she was vice-president for Iowa at the place assigned for the state. In May 1886, she resigned her position in the Treasury Department and returned to Iowa. Return to Iowa On June 17, 1886, she married Hon. Edwin N. Chapin (1823-1896), editor and publisher of the Marshall County Times. The wedding took place at the Malaka farm, Jasper County, the home of her aged mother. He was widely-known as an Iowa pioneer journalist. On May 16, 1887, in Des Moines, Iowa, Chapin was the Chair of the National Committee of the National Equal Rights Party, which nominated for President of the United States, Belva Ann Lockwood, of Washington, D.C., and for Vice-President, Alfred H. Love, of Philadelphia. The convention adopted a platform favoring woman suffrage, pensions for all needy soldiers and sailors, protective tariff, with free sugar and lumber, and repeal of tax on whisky and tobacco, and against unrestricted emigration. In the same year, she published a book entitled, Life at the National Capital; and she was elected as a national delegate by the Woman's Relief Corps (W.R.C.) to the convention in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1888, the women of the National Woman's Press Association made her a vice- president for Iowa. She had been its treasurer and a charter member from its organization, in 1883, at Washington. In 1890, she wrote The Iowa Cranks, but on the advice of Rev. F. E. Judd, then rector of St. Paul's Episcopal church, she published it under her husband's name. It was anti-prohibition and considered an unpopular theme, but sold well, however. In 1891, at the state convention held in Grinnell, Iowa, she was elected national delegate to the convention of the ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.) held in Detroit, Michigan. At the state convention held in Ottumwa, Iowa, May 12, 1892, she was elected state department president for Iowa, Ladies of the G.A.R.. At the Woman's Congress at Washington, D.C. in February 1891, she was a state delegate for Iowa, and in 1892, she was elected president of the Marshall County World's Fair Association, which society was a failure. She also served at about that time in various capacities in local organizations. In 1893, she was engaged in the publication of The Pioneer, a monthly paper devoted to Marshall County history, and that was her last publishing venture, aside from outside newspaper correspondence. Chapin represented Iowa at the National American Woman Suffrage Association convention of 1893. For many years, she was also affiliated with the Iowa branch of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Later life and death She lived quietly during her later years, since her health began to fail. ( Chapin died at Marshalltown, Iowa, August 20, 1901, due to avalvular heart disease, and was buried at Riverside Cemetery in that city.

A member of the genus Nanhaipotamon, it was first described in December 2018 and is closely related to other land crabs such as Nanhaipotamon hongkongense. Discovery A scientific study, commissioned by the Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau of Macao and the University of New South Wales, was conducted in 2018 with the aim of surveying the freshwater crabs resident in the country of Macao and neighboring parts of China, as well as redescribing the Wuping Crab (Nanhaipotamon wupingense), a closely related species of land crab whose original type specimen was lost after being described in insufficient detail. One preserved specimen thought to represent the Wuping Crab, collected in Macao in 2010, was examined in the course of this study and subsequently described as an entirely new species of crab, Nanhaipotamon macau, on the basis of morphological differences between it and the Wuping Crab, which is now considered endemic to Xiaba in the province of Fujian. Distribution The Coloane hill crab has an extremely restricted distribution encompassing 12 hill streams on the Macanese island of Coloane, occurring across approximately 5.3 square kilometres of territory (excluding sea area) of which only 3 square kilometres are believed to be occupied by the crab. Nevertheless, although not evaluated for conservation status by the IUCN, it is not considered threatened, as it is abundant throughout its habitat, none of the streams it occupies are threatened with development, the crab is not collected for food or as an aquarium specimen, and it inhabits a protected area, specifically the Ka-Ho Reservoir Freshwater Wetland.

The original lineup consisted of Peter Sámel on guitar, Ján Lapoš on drums, Vlado Suchán on bass, and Dušan Horecký on vocals. Early success led to sold-out concert halls in Bratislava and later in other cities, and eventually the band entered the studio, where they recorded their first singles, \\"Únik\\" (Escape) and \\"Klub Milionárov\\" (Millionaires' Club), in 1985. Biography After the band's initial success on the live circuit, they received an offer from music publishing house Opus Records to record their first single. In 1986, Horecký was replaced by Pavol Drapák as lead vocalist. The band recorded their next single, \\"Každý chce ľúbiť\\" (Everyone Wants to Love), and won fourth place at the Bratislavská lýra music festival with the song \\"Loď pre 5 miliárd\\" (Ship for 5 Billion). At this point, Drapák exited the band. Several vocalists were trialled, including Tibor Fuzek, who had previously worked with the group Kobra; Fuzek brought with him Metalinda's second guitarist, Michal Kovalčík. In 1988, Paľo Drapák returned. During this period, Vlad Suchán was replaced by Martin Cepka. 1990 saw the release of Metalinda's debut self-titled album, and in 1991, their sophomore effort, Za všetky prachy (For All the Money) came out; the record was released on the Czech label Tommü Records and produced by Jožo Ráž and Július Kinček. The most famous song from the album was \\"Zaľúbená žaba\\" (Lovestruck Frog), with a video starring Czech actress Anna Geislerová. The band's third album, Svetlo na druhom brehu (Light on the Opposite Shore), came out in 1992. On the concert tour to promote the record, Metalinda spoke out against drug addiction. Martin Cepka was replaced by Márius Bartoň during the tour, who was then in turn replaced by Fero Gašparík. Metalinda released their fourth album, Láska holých prenáša, in 1994. Michal Kovalčík subsequently left the band, and Metalinda again became a quartet with only one guitarist. Their fifth album, Maj May (1995), was released on the band's own music label MetaMusic. 15,000 copies were sold in the first four months alone. During the concert tour, Metalinda recorded material for their first concert album, which was released in the same year under the title Noc s Metalindou (A Night with Metalinda). This concert debut was followed by the studio album Na kolenách (On Your Knees). After this period, drummer Ján Lapoš left the band. This was followed by another studio album, Skús sa do mňa zahryznúť (Try to Bite Into Me) in 1996. In 1999, the band released their first compilation, called Hitovky (Hits). Zavesení v prievane followed in 2000, and singer Pavol Drapák left the group again. Metalinda organized a contest to find a new vocalist, and Roman Čief won the spot, joining the band on their next concert tour. In 2003, Metalinda released a double album called Tutovky (Definitives), of which one is a CD with new songs and the other is a loose continuation of Hitovky, including some re-recorded tracks. In September 2003, former vocalist Dušan Horecký returned to the band, replacing Roman Čief. In 2005, Metalinda released the album Biológia (Biology). Horecký left again in 2006, and was replaced by Patrik Imre. In 2007, the album No. 13 came out, featuring a collaboration with Jožo Ráž on the track called \\"Nebo zastav dážď\\" (Sky, Stop the Rain).

The raid led to proposed anti-homosexuality legislation in South Africa. It also helped coalesce the queer community in South Africa.  Background  The South African police had conducted periodic raids on other private queer parties and also in public places prior to the Forest Town raid. These raids, however, were smaller in scope and not publicized in the same way as the Forest Town raid. As apartheid in South Africa grew in scope, it was also important to the government to end the actions of people who were \\"deemed threatening to white civilisation.\\" Gay people were seen as \\"bogeymen\\" who threatened the country.  Forest Town raid  The Forest Town party was held in January 22, 1966 in the Johannesburg suburb, Forest Town, Gauteng. The party, on Wychwood Road, was meant to be a glamorous event and included prominent gay socialites. It was a \\"bottle-party\\" with guests bringing their own alcohol. Around 350 people attended the party. Police, dressed in civilian clothes, raided the home early in the morning and infiltrated the party. They arrested 9 men for different charges, including masquerading as women, \\"gross indecency\\" and the illegal sale of liquor. One of the people arrested was drag queen, Michele Bruno.  Aftermath  News coverage, including an article from the Rand Daily Mail described the party as a \\"mass sexy orgy.\\" The press also focused on the professional class, such as prominent doctors and lawyers, who were present at the event. The newspaper even printed names of attendees. The press helped create a fear of \\"deviant\\" lifestyles and called it a problem for the white community of South Africa. Later, evidence collected by the police was used to influence the creation of anti-homosexuality legislation. The legislation proposed was introduced by the Minister of Justice, P.C. Pelser in March of 1967 in the House of Assembly. The new law would criminalize both male and female homosexuality and sentence offenders to prison for up to three years. This is the first time that lesbians would be subject to punishment under the law and it made the homosexuality, not just homosexual actions illegal. The queer community became more politically organized after the raids in order to fight the proposed laws. Lesbians, feeling an existential threat, especially became more active. Queer activists created the Homosexual Law Reform Fund (Law Reform) to raise money for attorneys to challenge the proposed law. Law Reform groups were created across the country. The Law Reform movement did cause the South African legislature to drop the proposed law and instead, the Select Committee created three amendments to the current law of the Immorality Act. These included raising the age of consent for homosexual sex acts to be raised to age 19, outlawed dildoes and criminalized male homosexual acts at parties. Black LGBT individuals were also further marginalized after the raids. However, gay culture overall in South Africa found a greater sense of coherence following the fight against the anti- homosexual laws.

Her political activities, which led to the military trial, may have garnered some of the most provocative news coverage during the early days of the U.S. antiwar movement against the Vietnam War. In October 1968, the San Francisco Chronicle called her the “Peace Leaflet Bomber” for raining tens of thousands of antiwar leaflets from a small airplane over several San Francisco Bay Area military installations and the deck of an aircraft carrier. The day after this “bombing” run, she marched in her officer’s uniform at the front of a large antiwar demonstration, knowing it was against military regulations. While the Navy was court-martialing her for “conduct unbecoming an officer” she was publicly telling the press “As far as I’m concerned, it’s conduct unbecoming to officers to send men to die in Vietnam.” Background=Enlistment and experiences Susan Schnall () was born on March 9, 1943 in Quantico, Virginia to Harold and Anne LeVine. Her father, a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps, was killed during the U.S. invasion of Guam in 1944 when she was 14 months old. She attended Stanford University’s five-year nursing program and signed up to be a Navy nurse when the military promised to pay her last two years of education. Even at that point she “was against all war, all violence” and explained this to the military recruiter. But she did want “to alleviate suffering by caring for wounded troops” and was convinced to proceed when the recruiter said nurses take care of all human beings, “whether they’re the enemy or not.” While at Stanford in 1967, she met and married Peter Schnall who was in medical school. In the Navy she was assigned to the Oakland Naval Hospital where her work brought her face to face with the horrors of the war. “I can still remember the nighttime screams of pain and fear” she recalled years later. More, she felt the whole purpose of military medicine “is to take wounded guys out of the battlefield and put them back in again as quickly as possible.” This put her in a difficult position because the military is known for its strict discipline and harsh punishments for disobedience. But Schnall told Redbook magazine, which ran a long story on her in November 1969, that by the summer of 1968 she had “lost her fear of the military”. “It simply vanished I don’t know why”. At that point she felt she had real freedom and she could take full responsibility for her actions. Leaflet “bombing” Leaflet for the GI's & Veterans March for Peace October 12, 1968 Schnall heard about an upcoming GI and Veterans March for Peace scheduled to take place in San Francisco on October 12, 1968 and decided to get involved. With other organizers, she put up demonstration posters around the hospital base, which she said “were quickly torn down” and base personnel were “forbidden to receive or circulate information”. She felt this was a violation of their constitutional right to circulate information about the march. She recalled seeing on the news that B-52 bombers were “dropping leaflets on the Vietnamese urging them to defect.” She thought, “if the United States can do that in Vietnam, they why can’t I do it here?” Together with her husband; James Rondo, a Vietnam war veteran; and the pilot, William E. Gray, they loaded up a small plane with leaflets and “bombed” the military installations in the Bay Area with tens of thousands of flyers announcing the demonstration. This was one of only two instances when the anti-Vietnam war movement is known to have taken to the air. The other was during the efforts to stop the U.S.S. Constellation from sailing to Vietnam in 1971 when recently retired navy flight instructor LT John Huyler flew a CONSTELLATION STAY HOME FOR PEACE banner numerous times over the city of San Diego. Marching in uniform Michael Locks, John Bright, and Hugh Smith in their Air Force uniforms promoting antiwar march When Schnall reported for duty the evening before the planned demonstration she was handed a newly issued regulation, ALNAV 53, that explicitly prohibited members of the Navy from attending “partisan political” events in uniform. Violators would be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This new regulation reflected growing concern within the military’s upper ranks that GI resistance to the war was becoming a problem, and they were particularly worried about GIs protesting in uniform. A communication from the Pentagon had gone out in August as they learned that organizers for the GI and Veterans March for Peace were encouraging GIs “to come to the march either in uniform or out of uniform if they are afraid of reprisals.”. The message expressed alarm that there was no existing regulation “specifically proscribing” protesting the war in uniform. And it recommended the drafting of a new regulation “at once”. It also was quite clear about the military’s stance on the October 12 march it should “be quashed if possible because of possible severe impact on military discipline throughout the services.” During the weeks prior to the march, GIs became bolder in their resistance. At a late September press conference, three active duty GIs, Airmen First Class Michael Locks and John Bright, and Second Lieutenant Hugh Smith appeared in their Air Force uniforms promoting the march. The Ally, a GI underground newspaper covering the press conference noted, “If they can openly organize and publicize this march, so can you. March with them....” When Schnall received the new regulation, she wondered about its legality. As she explained later, “General Westmorland wore his uniform in front of Congress, asking for more money, armaments, and troops. Why couldn’t I wear my uniform and speak against the war?” She decided to keep her options open and when she left work on the morning of the protest she had her uniform on under a large coat with her Navy cap in a bag. She arrived at the march rendezvous point in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park and found her husband and a group of corpsmen from the Naval hospital. She took off her coat and as fellow demonstrators recognized the impact and significance of her uniform she was encouraged to move to the front of the march. She found herself leading the protest with 700 other active duty GIs and reservists marching through San Francisco with up to 10,000 (some said 15,000) veterans and civilians. She marched arm-in-arm with retired Brigadier General Hugh B. Hester and U.S. Air Force Airman Michael Locks also in his uniform. After marching through town to the Civic Center, Schnall addressed the large crowd calling for an end to “this dirty, filthy war.” Locks also spoke, first reading from the regulation prohibiting him to be in uniform, and then saying “I can think of no greater cause to wear my uniform than for the cause of peace.” Airman Michael Locks, Lieutenant Susan Schnall and Brigadier General Hugh B. Hester Growing GI resistance The military had already witnessed increasing GI resistance to the war within their ranks. Prior resistance had been individual, like Army Captain Howard Levy's refusal to train Green Berets, or sporadic group actions like the Fort Hood Three, who collectively refused orders to combat, and the Fort Hood 43, who refused orders to deploy to the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago for riot-control duties. The October demonstration in San Francisco contained a larger contingent of active duty GIs than ever before in an anti-Vietnam war demonstration, and several of them marched, spoke and gave press conferences in uniform. Then at the end of the march, a group of four AWOL soldiers turned themselves in to the military and were confined in the Army's military prison at the Presidio. The Army quickly regretted this when the four met with the other prisoners over the weekend, who were already angry over the horrible prison conditions and the recent guard murder of a fellow prisoner, and convinced them to participate in a protest over prisoner conditions and against the war. On October 14, 27 prisoners staged a sit-down protest which became known as the Presidio mutiny, one of the largest early instances of internal military resistance to the Vietnam War. Court-martial=Charges She is charged with leaflet bombing Two days after the demonstration, both Schnall and Locks were charged with violating the UCMJ and were set to receive general courts- martial. On November 14, 1968 Schnall faced a formal hearing at the Treasure Island Naval Base where she was officially charged with disobeying a direct order not to wear her uniform and conduct unbecoming an officer. The San Francisco Chronicle ran a smiling photo of her with the caption “She is charged with leaflet bombing”. She was officially charged with marching in the GIs and Vets March for Peace in her uniform and dropping leaflets “with design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among members of the armed forces of the United States.” If convicted on both charges, she faced up to four years in military prison. Verdict At the court-martial in late January 1969, the military presented evidence of Schnall’s political activity, which no one disputed, while Schnall testified in her own defense arguing that the order barring her from participating in a “partisan political” demonstration was a violation of her right to free speech. She said she was an officer and a member of the military, and felt it was “proper and dignified” to wear the uniform while exercising her right to say she was against the war. The military court found her guilty after twenty minutes of deliberation and sentenced her to six months of hard labor, forfeiture of all pay and dismissal from the Navy. Locks, one of the principal organizers of the October 12th demonstration, was separately court-martialed and sentenced to a year at hard labor, forfeiture of all pay, reduction in rank to airman basic and a bad conduct discharge. Aftermath=Reaction Schnall later told Redbook that she finally felt good about herself as Lieutenant Schnall. “It represented not what is going on in Vietnam, but my own stand for peace, for an end to all wars.” She described the march and speech she gave as “my coming out as a human being.” Due to an obscure Navy policy that any woman sentenced to less than a year in prison cannot be confined, Schnall served out her sentence as a nurse at the Oakland Naval Hospital. Ironically, the staff where she worked kept a scrapbook of news clippings about the Navy hospital and its staff which is now immortalized on the internet Schnall’s clippings are carefully pasted into many of its pages. Continued activism While still working at the Navy hospital, Schnall continued to organize against the war, helping to create an antiwar GI coffeehouse and writing for local GI underground newspapers. Once out of the Navy, she moved to New York City where she worked in the intensive care unit at Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx while also working with the Medical Committee for Human Rights and a group called Medical Aid for Indochina that raised money for medical supplies that went to North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front. For many years she was the executive administrator of Quality/Risk/Care Management, Regulatory Affairs, and Medical Records at a number of public hospitals in New York City, retiring from Bellevue Hospital Center in 2006. She has been an Assistant Adjunct Professor, New York University, School of Professional Studies, Healthcare Management for over 20 years. After retiring from hospital work she traveled to Vietnam where she saw children who had been born with terrible deformities and birth defects caused by the U.S. chemical Agent Orange. She began working with an organization called Vietnam Agent Orange Relief and Responsibility Campaign and is now on their Board. She also the president of the New York City chapter of Veterans for Peace. In August, 2016 she presented a paper on the Health Effects on American Service Members who served in Vietnam at an international conference on Agent Orange/dioxin in Hanoi. In April, 2015 she was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Humanities by Ohio Wesleyan University. When asked in a 2019 interview to reflect on her life she said she hoped she had be able to educate and inform people “that you can take a step against the reigning authority or the reigning government, and you can say, ‘I disagree with you, and I’m going to do something about it.’ That you not only will survive, but you’ll survive with your moral conscience intact.” See also * A Matter of Conscience * Brian Willson * Concerned Officers Movement * Court-martial of Howard Levy * Donald W.

She ran a quarry business after the death of her husband, John Husler. She ran the business until her death at the age of 71, after which she left her share of the business to one of her sons.  Early life  Ann Husler, née Procter, was born in February 1803 in Armley, Leeds, England to James and Mary Procter, and was baptized on 20 February 1803. Her father was a cloth maker,St. Peter's Church, Leeds, Register of Marriages: marriage of James Procter, clothmaker, to Mary Farrer on 14 May 1798. originally from Headingley Register of Baptisms at Headingley Chapel,7 July 1776. Baptism of James Procter son of William Procter. She married John Husler (1802–1853) at the age of 19 on 15 April 1822 at St Peter's Church in Leeds, signing the register with a cross. She had her first child, a daughter named Mary, in that same year on 4 November 1822. They proceeded to have eleven more children over the course of twenty years, although three died in childhood. Career John Husler came from a family of quarrymen and stone masons. Quarrying quickly became a major industry as a result of the Industrial Revolution, as the need for materials to construct public works like bridges, railways and docks grew, as well as new buildings for home and work in urban and rural areas. Husler saw this demand, and after running a quarry at Woodhouse, Leeds, leased sandstone quarries at Weetwood in 1840 with his business partner, John Cliff. As their business expanded they rented a wharf in Leeds and in London, on the Isle of Dogs, to transport their stone. John Cliff left the business in 1846, and John Husler expanded it by securing key contracts for his stone, such as Armley Gaol (now known as HM Prison Leeds), which was completed in 1847 and Leeds Industrial SchoolsLeeds Industrial Schools, 26 September 1846, Leeds Intelligencer. In 1849 John Husler moved his family to a large house, Victoria House, in Weetwood Mill Lane, and began the building of a row of cottages for his quarrymen, known now as Hustler's Row, next to the stream near his quarry (Meanwood Park). He also built a larger terrace, Victoria Terrace, off the Otley Road, for rent. 17 May 1851, advertisement for 'Houses to Let', Leeds Intelligencer In 1851, he won the contract to build the Kilkenny to Waterford railway in Ireland. While he was in Ireland working on this project with his local business partner, William Ellis, Ann ran the quarry businesses in Leeds in his stead. When John died suddenly in 1853 in Waterford, leaving Ann widowed still with young children to care for, she continued to manage the Leeds business single- handedly, and also handled the disputes over his estate due to litigation over the debts he took on for the railway project. From 1853 to 1874, Ann Husler expanded the quarry business, and by 1860 she employed 75 men and 18 boys in the quarries. That same year, she renewed her lease of 93 acres at Weetwood for 21 years, which included the quarries. The stone from Weetwood quarry was in high demand during this period, and it was used build Westminster Bridge, which took 8 years to build from 1854 to 1862. She brought two of her sons, Joseph and Alfred, into the family business, but Joseph moved to Australia in 1870 with his family.In 1874 Joseph Husler was convicted of battering his wife to death in fit of delirium tremens, www.trove.nla.gov.au – Melbourne Weekly Times 10 October 1874 and 27 February 1875. She left her share of the business to her son, Alfred.https://www.thoresby.org.uk/content/people/husler.php. The quarry at Weetwood was closed in the 1880s and is now the site of gardens and residential properties. Ann Husler started out life without means or education, as demonstrated by her having to sign her marriage entry in the register with a cross. Yet she went on to manage a large business in a time where the industry was largely dominated by men, with skill, enterprise, and success.

The Lawik were closely related to the Kabul Shahi and Hindu Shahi dynasties. The Siyasatnama of Nizam al-Mulk, the Tabaqat-i Nasiri of Juzjani, and the Majma' al-ansāb fī't-tawārīkh of Shabankara'i (14th century) mentioned Lawiks. Wujwir Lawik According to Afghan historian Abdul Hai Habibi, Wujwir Lawik built a great idol-temple at Bamyan Gate, Ghazni in honor of the Ratbil and the Kabul Shah. Khanan Lawik Wujwir's son, Khanan (referred to as Khaqan in Zayn al-Akhbar), converted to Islam around 782 but then became an apostate. Around 784, Khanan demolished the idol-temple and buried his father's idol underneath it, converting the site into a mosque. Khanan was sent a poem by the Kabul Shahis, saying: \\"Alas! The idol of Lawik has been interred beneath the earth of Ghazna, and the Lawiyan family have given away [the embodiment of] their kingly power. I am going to send my own army; do not yourself follow the way of the Arabs [i.e. Islam].\\" Abu Mansur Aflah According to Zayn al-Akhbar, written by historian Abu Sa'id Gardezi, Abu Mansur Aflah Lawik was reduced to a tributary status in Gardez by Emir Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar in 877. Abu Bakr Lawik In 962, the Turkic slave commander of the Samanid Empire, Alp-Tegin, attacked Ghazni and besieged the Citadel of Ghazni for four months. He wrested the town from its ruler Abu Bakr Lawik. Alp-Tegin was accompanied by Sabuktigin during this conquest. Around 965, Abu Bakr Lawik recaptured Ghazni from Alp-Tegin's son, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim, forcing him to flee to Bukhara. However, this was not to last long because Abu Ishaq Ibrahim shortly returned to the town with Samanid aid, and took control of the town once again. Abu Bakr Lawik was thereafter no longer mentioned; he died before 977, the year that Ghaznavid control was established in Ghazni. Although Juzjani gave Abu Bakr Lawik the Islamic kunya of Abu Bakr, Shabankara'i claimed he was a non-Muslim. Abu Ali Lawik Abu Ali Lawik was the son of Abu Bakr Lawik, and also a brother-in-law of the Hindu Shahi ruler of the region, Kabul Shah.The wonder that was India II by S A Rizvi Published by Picador India Page 12 About one decade after Abu Ishaq Ibrahim's capture of Ghazni, the people of Ghazni invited Abu Ali Lawik to come back, take the throne, and overthrow the tyrant Samanid-appointed governor, Böritigin. The Kabul Shahis allied with Lawiks and the king, most likely Jayapala, sent his son to assist Lawiks in the invasion. When the allied forces reached near Charkh on Logar River, they were attacked by Sabuktigin who killed and captured many of them while also capturing ten elephants. Böritigin was expelled and Sabuktigin became governor in 977 A.D. The accession was endorsed by the Samanid ruler Nuh II. Later Lawiks On the other hand, the neighboring town of Gardez remained in Lawik hands until c. 977, when the dynasty was finally uprooted. Samanid-appointed governor Bilgetegin was killed by Lawiks during his siege of Gardez in 975. Abu Sahal Marsal According to Zayn al-Akhbar, Abu Sahal Marsal Lawik served as the ambassador of the court of Ghazni in Baghdad, and brought letters and robes of honor from the Abbasid Caliphate for the Ghaznavid Sultan Mas'ud I in 1040.

It is an important source for the Christian geography of the Sapna valley in the tenth century and contains a wealth of detail about the lifestyle of East Syriac monks of the period. Joseph was active in the first half of the tenth century. A native of Beth ʿEdraye, near Mosul,; , identify his birthplace with the village of Bozan at the foot of Mount Alqosh. he entered the monastery of Rabban Hormizd and later moved to that of Abraham of Beth Ṣayyare in the ʿAmadiyya district. He founded his own monastery in the village of Inishk, which later had to be moved to the top of a hill to protect it from Kurdish raids. Joseph became a critic of the bookish learning traditions of the East Syriac church. He was a skilled copyist of Scripture but in his old age he gave up all writing. John took care of his correspondence (in Arabic). Joseph focused on memorizing. According to John, he memorized all of both the Old and New Testaments and the thirty-three volumes of Theodore of Mopsuestia. He claimed to be able to recite a text after reading it five times. Joseph was reputedly 110 years old when he died on 4 September 979, which would put his birth in 869. Joseph's feast day is celebrated on the sixth Friday of summer (thirteenth after Pentecost) in the East Syriac calendar.

The film stars newcomer Sarah Campbell (ten years old when the film was released) Jeremy Ratchford, and veteran Canadian actors Barbara Hamilton and Heath Lamberts. Synopsis Maggie (Sarah Campbell) is a precocious girl of about seven, who, since the recent accidental death of her mother, lives with her bedridden aunt Bea (Barbara Hamilton) in a small town in Ontario. With Bea's health failing and the bills piling up she may lose the house and Maggie may end up in a foster home. Maggie does what she can to help, washing cars among other odd jobs. When Maggie wins $10,000 in a lottery, her ne'er-do-well grifter uncle Felix (Jeremy Ratchford) tries to con her out of her winnings, making a deal with her to find her unknown father in exchange for paying his $8,000 gambling debt. She agrees and they go on a road trip to Toronto together even though she does not trust him and he does not like children. During her adventure with Felix, Maggie meets many colourful characters. They find Maggie's father Axel (Heath Lamberts), a very flamboyant gay millionaire whom her mother befriended while singing in lounges. Felix is able to rid himself of his debt and Maggie's home is safe in time for Christmas. By this point, he and Maggie have grown to respect and love one another. Cast ;Main ;Supporting Production=Background and writing Change of Heart was Donald Shebib's first film since directing the 1990 made for television film The Little Kidnappers. Screenwriter Terence Heffernan had previously collaborated with Shebib on the TV movie The Canary (1974) and on Shebib's 1981 feature Heartaches. The screenplay, titled Maggie & Felix, was developed from a story by both Heffernan and Shebib. Shebib thought the final script was very funny and called it a \\"classic redemption story.\\" Casting and filming In a 2013 interview, Shebib remarked that Felix was supposed to be more like the character of Uncle Buck, and that he had hoped to cast John Candy for the part, suggesting the film would have been \\"a huge success\\" had that happened: \\"I think he got [the script] and his agent said, \\"You're not even allowed to read it,\\" because it didn't come with an offer. That's too bad, because he would have been great in it.\\" Shebib further remarked that Jeremy Ratchford was very young and \\"not very good\\" in most of the film but did finally get \\"really good in the last part\\". By contrast, he considered Sarah Campbell, a child actor and member of ACTRA since the age of two and ten years old when the film was released, \\"magnificent\\". Like most of his previous films, Change of Heart was shot primarily in Toronto, from 19 January to 29 February 1992. Financing Shebib said that Change of Heart was made \\"very cheaply.\\" Shebib described raising money for the project as \\"sheer hell\\": \\"I was scrambling around looking for ways of making money. There just wasn't anything.\\" Producer Chalmers Adams, who was also Shebib's lawyer, was responsible for the film finally securing funding. Release and reception With little or no advance promotion, Change of Heart premiered theatrically in Toronto on 21 May 1993 and closed after one week. It was also screened in September at the Cinefest Sudbury International Film Festival. Broadcasts, home media, and streaming The film is known to have aired occasionally on Canadian premium channels Moviepix and Bravo! as late as 2000, but was not released for the domestic video market, the only one of Shebib's feature films not to receive such a release; it remains unavailable for streaming. When Chalmers Adams was asked about it by Sam Weisberg in 2013, he responded \\"very tersely\\" to \\"several emails\\". Critical responseContemporary= Writing for the Toronto Star, Jamie Kastner described Change of Heart a \\"charming, warmer twist on the road movie genre\\", while the Star's critic Rob Salem described the film as \\"a gentle, heartfelt little family drama, well- cast and nicely acted\\". The same paper's Susan Kastner said it was a \\"feel- good\\" movie \\"sweetly done\\", lamenting its lack of exposure in the media and that other critics had found it \\"too uncool, too undeep, too sweet\\". Writing for Maclean's, Joe Chidley panned the film: \\"Like most family dramas, it tries to warm the heart and tickle the imagination. Instead, Change of Heart is so heavily laden with cheesy sentimentality that it could probably cause coronary failure. For adults, the film ... fails on almost every front. For kids, Change of Heart seems more like an after-school time-filler on TV than a feature movie.\\" =Retrospective= The Great Canadian Guide to the Movies calls the film an \\"O.K. family comedy\\" with \\"some very clever scenes and ideas,\\" though it is \\"a bit clunkily put together.\\" The reviewer on the German Cinema website suggests an otherwise nice film is sometimes overly sweet and kitsch.

A collection of Zande stories, Pa Rika Anya na Asanza, was published by the missionary Mrs. Edward Clive Gore in 1931, and republished in 1954; she and her husband, the Canon Edward Clive Gore, also published a number of volumes on Zande language. Many of the Zande stories were translated into English and published by E. E. Evans-Pritchard. Proverbs E. E. Evans-Pritchard argued that sanza, sometimes translated as \\"double-speak\\", is the dominant mode in Zande proverbs, and indeed it is used as a general term to describe proverbial sayings. The term also means \\"spite, hate, envy, and jealousy\\". He also maintains that, based on his studies, the Azande have many more proverbs than, for instance, the Nuer and Anuak people. Evans-Pritchard published many of these proverbs in a number of articles for the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. He comments that these proverbs do not feature rhyme or alliteration, but they have a notable rhythm or balance, \\"sometimes a balanced opposition, between the two halves of the sentence. Thus: sambiasambia i a so ko perapera / tiriki i a so ko pu, 'cautious one was grazed by the spear / it went right through the careless one'; i ni rigi nduka / nduka ki rigi ira ha, 'they feed the ridge / and the ridge feeds its owner'; i ni ngere ti boro / wa i ni ngere ti baga?, 'can one look into a person / as one looks into an open-wove basket?'; mvuru a ru ti mukumtuku / ki ya u kii ti ni, 'the little gazelle stood by the fallen (uprooted) tree / and said he was bigger than it...'; i na dia nga bambu ku ari yo / ka wada a ku sende no te, 'they do not begin a hut at the top / to thatch it down- wards'.\\" The proverbs often require an intimate understanding of the natural environment of the Zande people, as well as a knowledge of the sanza and the Zande folk tales, which the proverbs often lean on. Evans- Pritchard speculates that the relative preponderance of hunting references (as opposed to agricultural references) signals a past shift toward agriculture, and that the lack of reference to three Zande institutions (\\"rule of the Vongara aristocracy, witchcraft beliefs, and consultation of oracles\\") might mean the proverbs are older than these. Folk tales Many of the folk tales involve animals; \\"Azande broadly classify animal life into anya, animals (mostly mammals), azile, birds, awo, snakes, atio, fish and agbiro, insects. Reptiles, except the snakes, tend to be described as anya, animals, if they are large and as agbiro, insects, if they are small.\\" Game animals are divided into bi and zamba, which Evans-Pritchard translates as \\"light\\" and \\"dark\\"; the first category is sometimes not allowed to eat, for instance for boys who have recently been circumcised. Animals that are \\"ill-omened (ahu kpere)\\" include a wild cat (dandara), the jackal, the slough of the iguana (presaging death), the chameleon (presaging the death of a relative), a chimpanzee when on the ground. A frequent figure of speech in Zande stories, as with proverbs, is sanza, or \\"double-speak\\". Trickster tales The main trickster figure in Zande tales is Ture. In \\"Ture and Bigtooth\\", Ture steals a man's breadfruit from a tree and then tricks the man's children into killing their father. In \\"Ture and Yangaima\\", Yangaima acquires wealth by way of his father's plumes, which Ture steals from him. Both ascend in the sky to fight over them, and Yangaima now tricks Ture and gets his plumes back--in one version, Ture falls to the ground and begins to die.

In August, George Lewis accepted an invitation to cross the Atlantic on the airship Hindenburg as guest of the Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei. Ames directed Lewis to evaluated aeronautical research in Germany and Russia. In September 1936, George Lewis visited Germany to evaluate German aeronautical facilities. Lewis discovered Dr. Adolf Baeumker's, head of government aeronautical research in Germany, large scale funding and staffing. Baeumker reported directly to Hermann Goering with almost limitless funds for aeronautical laboratories. Lewis reported on the Germans' long-range research program. German aeronautical facilities were directed to spare no expense to increase aircraft speeds. Much of the research equipment had been modeled on the NACA's; when Baeumker first visited Goering, he had taken with him as a conversation piece a photograph of the NACA full-scale wind tunnel, and Goering decided on the spot to build one for Germany. In 1936, Lewis believed \\"that the equipment at Langley Field is equal to or better than the equipment in the German research laboratories.\\" \\"But,\\" he continued, \\"the personnel of the German research laboratories is [sic] larger in number, and the engineers have had an opportunity of having special training, which has not been afforded to many of our own engineers.\\" Lewis estimated that one German lab employed 1600 to 2000 persons compared with the 350 then at Langley. In 1938 at the request of the United States military, Charles Lindbergh traveled to Germany to evaluate German aviation.Time magazine, January 19, 1939. At a dinner hosted by the US ambassador to Germany Hugh Wilson, Lindbergh was presented the Order of the German Eagle by Germany's air chief, Hermann Göring, in attendance was Anne Lindbergh, Evangeline Lindbergh, and German aviation figures: Ernst Heinkel, Adolf Baeumker, and Willy Messerschmitt. Baeumker was also instrumental in the history and the emergence of the engineering school for aviation technology (IFL). In 1942 he became chairman of the Munich aviation research institute, and for the last three years of the war he had been part of the Luftwaffe's research leadership. He also did his doctorate at the University of Munich in 1944. In 1941 he became an honorary citizen of the Technical University of Munich. [1] Postwar After 1945, Baeumker worked in the United States as a consultant to the US Air Force in Baltimore and was granted American citizenship in 1954. In 1958, he was transferred to the headquarters of the American Air Force in Europe in Wiesbaden, where he worked as a consultant for German and American military command posts. From 1959 he was a member of the board of trustees of the German Society for Aviation Sciences. In 1961 he received the Great Cross of Merit.

He was awarded the Navy Cross during the battle of Iwo Jima in World War II.  Early life and World War II  John W. Antonelli was born on May 30, 1917, in Lawrence, Massachusetts. In 1940, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps upon graduating from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.  Marine Raiders  Antonelli was initially assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines. Soon after the United States entered World War II, 1/5 was re- designated as the 1st Separate Battalion in January 1942, and then re- designated again as the 1st Marine Raider Battalion the following month. First Lieutenant Antonelli deployed to Samoa with the 1st Marine Raider Battalion in April. In May, Antonelli was promoted to captain. He then led a raider company during the battles of Tulagi and Guadalcanal from August to October 1942. When the Marine Raider Battalions were disbanded in early 1944, Major Antonelli was assigned as the commanding officer of the newly activated 2nd Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division.  Battle of Iwo Jima  On February 19, 1945, Major Antonelli led his battalion in the amphibious landing on Red Beach One at Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands. On March 9, his battalion became pinned down by heavy enemy fire and was unable to advance. Antonelli moved forward of the front lines to observe the enemy and was wounded. He was evacuated to a field hospital after completing his mission and issuing the orders necessary for his Marines to resume the assault. Despite his wounds, Major Antonell left the field hospital on two occasions to return to his battalion and lead his Marines in further combat. He was later evacuated to a hospital ship on March 16 in order to prevent his wounds from becoming more infected. For his actions during the battle, Major Antonelli was awarded the Navy Cross. In May, Antonelli was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He later took part in the occupation of Japan after the war ended.  Later career and life  Antonelli later served as the executive officer of the Marine barracks in Boston, Massachusetts, and then became an instructor at the Naval Academy from 1947 to 1950. In 1953, he graduated from the Senior Course at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. In July 1959, Colonel Antonelli took command of the 4th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade, at Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. While at Kaneohe Bay, his wife, Lillian, served as the president of the Kaneohe Officers’ Wives Club. Antonelli held command of the 4th Marines until August 1961, when he was assigned to Headquarters, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. He later attended the National War College in Washington, D.C., before he was assigned to the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. From January to December 1967, Brigadier General Antonelli implemented a revised long range concept for the Marine Corps while he was the chairman of the long range study program. He then served as the commanding general of Marine Corps Base Quantico from January to September 1968. During his tenure, he oversaw the reorganization of the Marine Corps School into the Marine Corps Development and Education Command. Antonelli was awarded the Legion of Merit once he was relieved of his command and retired on September 30, 1968. John W. Antonelli died on March 26, 1999, in Norwood, Massachusetts. He was buried in Westwood.

It seeks to amend the Sarbanes–Oxley Act in requiring these companies to disclose to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission information on foreign jurisdictions that prevent the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) from conducting inspections. Such companies will be banned from trading and delisted from exchanges if the PCAOB is not able to audit specified reports for three consecutive years. Background In 2019, a similar bill titled the EQUITABLE Act was introduced by Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) in the United States Senate over concerns certain foreign companies were non-compliant with oversight and audit rules on American stock exchanges. This was in response to the lack of compliance and transparency among Chinese companies listed on US exchanges, thereby increasing the risk of defrauding investors. The consideration of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act in Congress coincided with the high-profile financial scandal involving Chinese coffee chain Luckin Coffee, which fired both its CEO and COO in May 2020 for accounting fraud concerning the intentional fabrication of around $310 million in sales in 2019. This subsequently resulted in Luckin's shares plunging by around 80%. Luckin also received a delisting notice from the Nasdaq stock exchange on May 19, 2020. On June 26, it was confirmed that Luckin would be delisted from the Nasdaq and Luckin's stock saw its last day of trading.

He is best known as a friend of Pliny the Younger, having received a number of letters from Pliny. Paullinus was suffect consul in the nundinium of September to December 107 as the colleague of Gaius Julius Longinus.; ; Ronald Syme has strongly suggested that Paullinus is the son of the identically named Gaius Valerius Paulinus, procurator of Gallia Narbonensis.Syme, Tacitus (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958), p. 63 n. 5 Paullinus opposed Fabius Valens when the latter raided Gaul during the Year of the Four Emperors.Tacitus, Histories, iii.43 Except for being suffect consul, Paullinus' career is otherwise unknown. Because there are a number of lacunae in the records of known proconsulships and imperial appointments, one cannot assume he did not hold any.  Paullinus and Pliny  Paullinus has been identified as the recipient of five surviving letters from Pliny the Younger and mentioned in a sixth, as well as being the subject of an exchange of letters between Pliny and the emperor Trajan. Although they do not provide a biographical narrative for Paullinus, they give some sense of Pliny's relationship with the man. The first to appear in Pliny's collected letters provides little information, containing only a gentle rebuke to Paullinus for not writing more often to Pliny.Pliny, Epistulae, II.2 In one letter in book four, which he wrote to his friend Cornelius Ursus about the trial of Julius Bassus, Pliny mentions Paullinus as making a motion in the trial, by which Paullinus gained \\"a reputation for fair dealing and integrity.\\"Pliny, Epistulae, IV.9.20-22 In another letter in the same book addressed to Paullinus, he describes how \\"a young man of some distinction\\" remained to listen to Pliny's speech in the Centumviral court, despite having his tunic torn and Pliny's speech lasting seven hours.Pliny, Epistulae, IV.16 Another letter to Paullinus begins with complimenting him on how humanely he treats the members of his household, then asks him to allow a freedman of Pliny, named Zosimus, to convalesce at Paullinus' villa at Forum Julii.Pliny, Epistulae, V.19 A fourth letter is a fluffy essay on the life of an aristocrat.Pliny, Epistulae, IX.3 The fifth is an apology that Pliny would be unable to attend Paullinus' inauguration as suffect consul because he had to attend to negotiating the rents of a number of his tenants on one of his estates.Pliny, Epistulae, IX.37 While Pliny was serving as procurator in Bithynia et Pontus, reviewing the finances of that Senatorial province at Trajan's request, he wrote the emperor for a favor involving Paullinus. That man had died and appointed Pliny executor of his estate. In his will, Paullinus had asked that some of his freedmen, who had been informally emancipated, and thus were Junian Latins, be granted full citizenship on his death. Pliny requested citizenship for only three of them (C. Valerius Astraeus, C. Valerius Dionysius, and C. Valerius Asper), worried he might \\"be going too far\\" to ask this grant for all of them; Trajan replies that not only he does grant this in their case, but \\"I intend to do the same in the case of the rest for whom you request it.\\"Pliny, Epistulae, X, 104, 105 These letters between Pliny and Trajan provide us a date for Valerius Paullinus' death, around AD 112.

He recalls that in 1819, he was on a stagecoach from Paris to Moulins where he met another young man, and they discussed their love affairs with older married women. The stagecoach rolls over, and the other young man is fatally injured. Before he dies, he asks the narrator to go to his home, fetch the love letters from his lover and return them to her. The narrator does as he is told, and goes to the château of Count and Countess de Montpersan outside Moulins to return the letters. There he informs the couple of the young man's death. The narrator is asked to stay for dinner by the count. However, the countess does not attend the dinner, and the narrator joins a search for her. He finds her in an outbuilding crying for her young lover. Later that night, the countess visits the narrator's room to learn more of her lover's death, and he also returns the letters.

He graduated from two faculties: the Technical Faculty in Belgrade, the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Architecture in Munich. Политика, додатак „Моја кућа“, 27 мај 2011. Biography Branko Tanazević's father was a doctor, originally from Vojvodina, then under Habsburg Monarchy. At the invitation of a friend of the doctor and Prime Minister Vladan Đorđević, Branko Tanazević then moved to Serbia. His mother was from the family of Dositej Obradović. Branko Tanazević, the most expressive representative of the national style in Serbian architecture of the second half of the 19th century, also drew inspiration from profane folk architecture, looking at the Moravian house with arches, artistic embroidery and modern carpet weaving in Serbia. He presented his ideas in professional periodicals, becoming, along with the decorator Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak,the main ideologue of the national architectural called Serbo-Byzantine Revival. Hence, his buildings became synonymous with the \\"modern\\", instead of the conservative and mimetic direction of the national style. In addition to architectural creation, Tanazević was also a professor at the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Belgrade, where he taught: Ornamentation, Decoration, Modeling and Urban Planning. As a teacher of the then Architectural Department of the Technical Faculty, Branko Tanazević and Nikola Nestorović designed the building of technical faculties in Belgrade. It was built in 1931, though construction began in the autumn of 1925. Works In his first part-the building of the Telephone exchange, Kosovska 47, in Belgrade (1905-1908), Tanazević successfully reconciled tradition and modernity, placing on its asymmetrical façade, finished with an angular ribbed Art Nouveau dome, various \\"Neo-Moravian\\" openings, polychrome surfaces and ceramic plastic motifs. Large windows with a wide projection occupy significant areas of the wall canvas, while the shallow plastic, reduced to the flat facade, is composed of pseudo-medieval rosettes and chessboards. Along with the joints on the ground floor, which allude to Byzantine construction and intertwined ornamentation, a colourful structure was created, similar to the achievements of Serbian carpet weaving at the time. The attic wreath was breached again, and the openings were multiplied numerically and dimensionally crushed in accordance with the international practice of Art Nouveau from the ground floor to the top. In the asymmetrical composition of the façades of the Ministry of Education such as the Telefonska centrala (Old Telephone Exchange, 1908) and Vukova zadužbina (Vuk's Endowment House) in 1913, with non-medieval polychromy, intertwined ornamentation, three-leaf gable and the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbia were skillfully combined with Art Nouveau pilasters, plastic and elevation finishes. Tanazević used exciting light-dark contrasts, accentuated on the polychrome carpet facades of public buildings, including the house of Jovan Nikolić and Maksim Nikolić (1912-1914), where the relief of Saint George clearly recognizes the ideology of the national style in the gable of the composition and the colour derived from the Serbian tricolour. Of the fifty or so Tanazević projects, the house of the Nikolić brothers, at 11 Njegoševa Street in Belgrade, should certainly be singled out. An interesting, white-red facade in a combination of Art Nouveau and Moravian style, is one of the most beautiful decorations of Cvetni trg.

The park is named after the Seton family (of which Elizabeth Ann Seton was a member), who owned the land in the 19th century. Seton Falls Park is located southeast of the intersection of East 233rd Street and Baychester Avenue. It contains a playground and athletic fields, as well as the only above-ground section of a small creek called Rattlesnake Brook. Due to its seclusion, the park site has been used for dumping in the past, and several corpses have been left there. Seton Falls Park's site was occupied by the Siwanoy tribe of Native Americans prior to European settlement in the 17th century. The land was later owned by several individuals, including a Roosevelt family ancestor, before being passed to the Seton family via marriage. The Seton family estate and surrounding area was annexed by New York City in 1894, and the city acquired land on the site in 1914, officially designating it as a parkland in 1930. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) subsequently added recreational facilities to Seton Falls Park. After a period of disrepair in the late 20th century, Seton Falls Park was restored.  Description  The park, operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks), covers in the Edenwald section of the northeast Bronx, near New York City's border with the town of Mount Vernon, New York. It is bounded by East 233rd Street on the north, Baychester Avenue on the west, Crawford Avenue and Marolla Place on the south, Pratt Avenue on the southeast, and private property on the east. The campus of the former John Philip Sousa School (JHS 142), as well as PS 111, occupies a portion of the western boundary. The site is near the Eastchester–Dyre Avenue station of the New York City Subway's (formerly of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway).  Geographic features  The park is traversed by Rattlesnake Brook, a small creek that originally emptied into Eastchester Bay and is now mostly covered over. The section of the creek through the park is the only portion of the creek that is still above ground. The brook's course contains a waterfall within the park. While the brook itself is naturally fed, the waterfall is artificial. The creek flows from west to east, and there are several walking paths around the brook. Seton Falls Park contains the Seton Falls Park Preserve. The wildlife preserve serves as a habitat for over 30 bird species. There are cattail marshes, sedge meadows, and floodplain forests along the creek's path. There are oak-hickory forests in the higher portions of the park. Frogs, turtles, and waterfowl can also be seen in the park.  Recreational features  Seton Falls Park contains High Rock Playground at its northwest corner. At the park's southwest corner is Stars & Stripes Playground, which contains handball courts and basketball courts as well as a children's play area. The latter is jointly operated by NYC Parks and the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE). In the past, there was also a baseball field in the park.  History = Site  Prior to the park's development, the region had many oak, chestnut, hickory, and walnut trees, as well as caves and other settlements occupied by the Siwanoy tribe of Native Americans. There was a crevice that could supposedly conceal several people; a series of half-natural, half-man-made \\"Indian Fortifications\\", and a large cave on the ground. In 1654, the surrounding land was purchased by Thomas Pell. After Pell died, his nephew Sir John Pell was given permission to build a mill on Rattlesnake Brook in 1696. During the American Revolutionary War, in 1781, a skirmish between British and American troops took place in what is now the park's site. By 1790, the land comprising comprising present-day Seton Falls Park had been deforested. Seton family home on the park site According to NYC Parks, after the Revolutionary War, ownership of the park site passed to James Roosevelt, a member of the Roosevelt family. City tax records show that in 1817, merchant David Cargill Jr. sold a parcel of the parkland to carpenter Thomas Secord, who resold it to George Miller in 1821. However, the tax records do not mention who owned the site before Cargill. The banker Nathaniel Prime acquired title to the land in 1835, and later gave it to his daughter Emily, who married Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton's son William Seton. The estate became known as The Cedars, and later as Cragdon, due to the property's abundance of red cedar trees. William Seton cut down many of the trees and dammed Rattlesnake Creek, creating two ponds and a waterfall. The mansion on the estate, located near the cave, was described as being similar to Hamilton Grange, the old Manhattan estate of U.S. treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton. William and Emily Seton had six children, who had left the estate by 1860. For the next several decades, Cragdon was rented out, but not permanently occupied, and was affected by theft and vandalism. The land had been replanted with oak and elm trees by 1905. Seton's mill was destroyed in a 1900 storm, but the waterfall remained. The cascade was described as a descent with two separate falls.  Park establishment  The parkland and surrounding area was annexed by New York City in 1894, and the Seton estate was broken up into lots. The next year, the Setons held an auction to sell off the land, though some lots went unsold. According to tax records, most of the land comprising Seton Falls Park was sold to a developer in 1906, but some of the land was so steep as to be unusable for development. By the first decade of the 20th century, the old Cragdon estate was being used unofficially as a park. Among those who frequented the area were picnickers, artists, and couples on romantic retreats. The estate's cave was frequented by picnickers. The city selected the Seton estate in April 1914 as the site for a new contagious-disease hospital. The original sale price of $135,000 was negotiated down to $82,500. In June 1914, the city acquired title to between of land on the Seton estate. For the next fifteen years, the city tried to develop the land as a hospital, though residents opposed the move. After failing to sell the lot in 1922, the city transferred ownership of the land to the Sinking Fund Commission in 1929, and the commission transferred ownership to NYC Parks on June 11, 1930. Another were ceded to the city in 1932. Seton Falls, 1913 NYC Parks subsequently began adding amenities including fountains, benches, outhouses, and a baseball field to Seton Falls Park. In addition, Rattlesnake Creek was placed into a stone channel and the two ponds on the Seton estate were infilled. According to maps drawn by NYC Parks, the trees from the late 19th century were preserved and had grown into a mature forest. In 1941, parks commissioner Robert Moses announced that he wanted \\"to expand Seton Falls Park to the west\\". Some were acquired by the New York City Board of Estimate for this purpose. The land was instead developed as JHS 142, which opened in 1958 or 1959. The adjacent Stars & Stripes Playground opened in 1961.  Degradation and cleanup  The development of the northeast Bronx led to increased use of the park, which in turn led to degradation of the landscape. A Community Planning Board report in 1967 advocated for cleaning the park, though the report did not recommend adding active recreational facilities. By 1970, Seton Falls Park was in disrepair. Garbage blocked the flow of Rattlesnake Creek, there was a high rate of vandalism, and picnickers had long stopped going to the park. A civic leader said that the park's condition was \\"because of almost criminal neglect by the Parks administration and because of the dumpers and night riders who don't give a damn for the health and safety of other people\\". Rattlesnake Creek's exit culvert was destroyed in 1973, which caused a backup of water flows and eventually created a swamp that killed the trees along the creek. In response to the degradation of the park, the city government considered a renovation project in 1974, though the renovation was delayed due to the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis. This resulted in further degradation, including rampant dumping. Design for Seton Falls Park's restoration was commenced in 1978. When NYC Parks had opened bidding for renovation in 1974, several contractors submitted plans that were to cost millions of dollars. NYC Parks, intending to save money, devised its own design that would only cost $800,000. The first phase of renovation, completed in 1981, cost $250,000 and resulted in the diversion of Rattlesnake Creek into the city's sewer system. Subsequently, a broken sewer line under Rattlesnake Creek's destroyed exit culvert was repaired, as was the culvert itself. Additionally, the park gained land in 1983 and 1985; the NYCDOE transferred the land around JHS 142 to NYC Parks so that a fence could be erected around the park's forest. The second phase of reconstruction started in December 1986. Peter Dunleavy, who designed the landscape plan for the park's reconstruction, won a 1985 \\"excellence in design\\" award from the New York City Art Commission. In 1990, NYC Parks announced that it would restore in the park. The park had fallen into disuse by the mid-1990s, and New York Knicks forward Charles Oakley proposed converting Seton Falls Park into a mostly recreational facility. This plan was opposed by community activist Christine Foreman, who instead created the Seton Falls Park Preservation Coalition to clean up the park. With NYC Parks' help, the group submitted an application for funding and received $500,000 for the park's renovation. Seton Falls Park was restored between 2007 and 2008 with $905,000 provided by the Croton Filtration Plant Mitigation Fund. In exchange for constructing the Croton Water Filtration Plant under Van Cortlandt Park, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection paid for the restoration of trails and various other elements in Seton Falls Park. However, it again went into disrepair shortly thereafter: in 2010, the park was among the best in the city in terms of maintenance, but two years later, it was the second-worst. In the 21st century, the park has been used for park-ranger tours, movie screenings, and protests. There have also been volunteer drives to remove invasive vegetation. In 2018, a skate park was proposed for Seton Falls Park.  Crime and dumping  Due to Seton Falls Park's seclusion, it has been used as a dumping ground for several dead bodies. For example, in 1997, a man was charged with murder after a girl's dead body was found in the park. Other corpses found in the park include that of a man found in 2009 and the body of a missing woman in 2016. Animal corpses have also been left in the park, including that of a pit bull in 2015, which was presumed to have been involved in illegal dog-fighting. There have been other crimes that have taken place in Seton Falls Park: for instance, a man was arrested in 2015 after several instances of sexual abuse in the park. Seton Falls Park has also been used for the dumping of other objects. For instance, after robbers stole eight bags of checks from a New York Central Railroad train in 1955, seven of the bags were later found in the park by a child picking berries. In the mid- and late 20th century, the park was used for dumping all types of garbage, and the soil was burned. Car thieves in particular frequented the park during the 1970s and 1980s. In a 1996 letter to mayor Rudy Giuliani, Oakley called the park \\"a very deep hole filled with trash and litter which during the summer months is occupied by drug addicts and prostitutes.\\" Litter continued to be a problem for the park in the 21st century.

Fuller was a 24-year-old African-American man who was found hanging from a tree in front of the City Hall in Palmdale, California. His death was ruled a suicide by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. City officials announced that they supported an independent investigation into his death. On July 9, 2020, the LA County Sheriff's office held a news conference announcing that the death was correctly determined a suicide and provided more supporting details from the investigation, including evidence that Fuller had purchased the rope used to hang himself on May 14, almost a month prior and tracked through his EBT purchases. No video exists of the purchase or of Fuller entering the park, however there is video evidence of Fuller using the same EBT card for other purchases subsequent to the purchase of the rope. There is also evidence that Fuller suffered from mental illness and had been hospitalized in Arizona in 2017 and diagnosed with auditory hallucinations after saying he wanted \\"to put a gun to his head.\\" In February 2019 he admitted himself to a hospital in California saying he was hearing voices telling him to kill himself. He was later hospitalized in November 2019 in Nevada after saying he planned to hurt himself. History Fuller's body was spotted by a passerby at 3:39 am on June 10. Emergency personnel responded to the scene and subsequently identified him as dead. His death was reported initially as an apparent suicide though a decision on the cause of his death is pending. An autopsy is planned. The manner of his death garnered significant attention in the wake of the Killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests. Members of Fuller's local community spoke to Palmdale city officials at a news briefing on June 12 asking as to why his death was described as a suicide and querying whether it was homicide. Members of the crowd at the press briefing shouted \\"Hell no!\\" in response to City Manager J.J. Murphy's request that \\"we stop talking about lynchings\\". Kim Kardashian urged her followers on Twitter to sign a petition demanding an investigation into Fuller's death. As of June 15, the FBI, U.S. attorney's office in the Central District of California and the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division were monitoring the investigations into Fuller's death and the hanging death of Malcolm Harsch, another African-American man also found hanging from a tree in nearby Victorville just 10 days earlier. Harsch's death was later confirmed a suicide. A fundraiser for Robert Fuller was launched on GoFundMe shortly after the family announced their belief that Fuller had been lynched, earning the family $237,012. It was later discovered that Fuller had a well known history of depression and mental illness had been hospitalized three times since 2017 with suicidal thoughts. Fuller had previously attempted to commit suicide as recently as February 2020. On Wednesday, June 18th, it was confirmed that Fuller's half-brother was killed in what police called a \\"gunfight\\" in Kern County. Several questions arose surrounding the killing. https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-19/sheriffs-shooting-robert- fuller-brother References Category:2020 deaths Category:2020 controversies in the United States Category:History of Los Angeles County, California Category:Suicides by hanging in California ","title":"Death of Robert Fuller"},{"id":"64268450","text":"Cristiano da Silva Vidal (born 23 August 1996) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a rightback for the club Goiás.

Chapin (June 5, 1823 – July 29, 1896) was an American postmaster and newspaper publisher. An outspoken and fearless advocate, he was often in controversy, and on account of his aggressive and combative disposition, came to be called \\"Old Grizzly\\". Chapin was a strong character, prominent as a pioneer, alert in business, a vigorous, out-spoken, independent editor, welcoming and standing by whatever promised to benefit his State, county or city. Chapin lived in Massachusetts twenty-seven years before he went to California in 1849. He was there for five years and returned to Massachusetts in 1854. He then removed to Iowa, and arrived in Marshall County, Iowa in June, 1855. He went to Rock Island, Illinois after a load of groceries, and also carted flour from Rock Island, which was the nearest flour-mill. In 1856, he commenced publishing the Iowa Central Journal, which he sold out to his partner, Mr. Barnhart. They started the Marshall County Times. He held the office of Supervisor of Marshall County. He was appointed Postmaster under President Abraham Lincoln, and was the first government officer removed by Andrew Andrew Johnson for political reasons. He was again appointed Postmaster by President Ulysses S. Grant in March, 1876. Early life Edwin N. Chapin was born in Monterey, Massachusetts, June 5, 1823. After receiving a common school education, he attended an academy for a short time. Hon. O. B. Chapin, who represented Hardin County, Iowa in the Legislature, in 1874-75, was his brother. Career For several years, he taught school. He engaged in charcoal burning for a while, disposing of the product at the blast furnaces. In December, 1849, aware of the California Gold Rush, he started for California by way of the Isthmus of Panama, and on account of difficulties with the officers of the ship on the Pacific Ocean side, helped to take possession of it, and after several months of voyaging, arrived at San Francisco. For some four years, he was engaged in mining and other pursuits in California, returning by way of Nicaragua, shipping for New York City at Greytown, in 1854. The following year he removed to Iowa. In 1855, he bought The Iowa Central Journal, then located at Lafayette, (later Albion), Marshall County, of Messrs. Wilson, Dunn and Tripp. Associated with him in the conduct of the paper was Mr. R. H. Barnhart. The paper was a champion of Marietta, and as Chapin had declared that he would not take the paper to the new county seat, in case of removal, he sold out his interest to his partner, who removed the paper to the new county seat. During the year 1857, Chapin settled in Marshalltown, Iowa and started The Marshall County News, which was subsequently destroyed by fire. During several years following this loss, he bought and sold The Times many times. In 1881, he was connected with The Reflector. He held several offices of trust and responsibility during his residence in Iowa. He was a member of the Board of Supervisors, and Post Master of Marshalltown under President Lincoln. In 1864, he was sent to Mississippi to take the vote of the Iowa soldiers, under appointment of Governor William M. Stone. Chapin was removed from the office of Post Master in 1865 by President Johnson, for alleged \\"offensive partisanship\\", Chapin having the honor to be the first official removed by President Johnson for political reasons. Chapin was re-appointed Post Master by President Grant, in 1876. In the development of the railroad system of Iowa, he bore a leading part, and when improvements were under consideration in Marshalltown, or in the county, he took the progressive side. Personal life He was married in 1857 to Miss Elizabeth Moore Moon, of Washington, Pennsylvania; and again in 1886 to Mrs. Nettie Sanford Chapin. He died at his residence in Marshalltown, July 29, 1896.
