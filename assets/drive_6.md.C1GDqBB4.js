In recent years, the operation of the mobile stalls faces challenges due to the government policies and modernization.

Fabienne Verdier (born 1962, Paris, France)Biography, FabienneVerdier.com is a French painter who works in France after years of studies in China. Career Fabienne Verdier's artistic path has taken her through successive phases of research, all focused on her fundamental areas of interest, including the dynamism of forces of nature, the instantaneous and enduring, and incessant movement.Von Drathen, Doris (2012).

Narrated by Jean de Loisy, curator of the exhibition. http://fabienneverdier.com/db/video/centre-pompidou-metz/ For the 50th anniversary edition of Le Petit Robert, France's household dictionary invited Verdier to celebrate the creative forces of the French language. Having been given a carte blanche, Verdier collaborated with lexicographer Alain Rey to create 22 works organized around word pairs such as arborescence-allegory, force-form, rhythm-reflection and duality-dialogue that appear in fold out pages throughout the text.http://50-ans-petit-robert.lerobert.com/ Many of the paintings were exhibited at the Mus√©e Voltaire in Geneva in late 2017 in a show organized by the Biblioth√®que de Gen√®ve, coordinated by Alexandre Vanautgaerden.http://institutions.ville- geneve.ch/fr/bge/actualites/medias/fabienne-verdier-lexperience-du-langage/ The art book Polyphonies, a co-publication of Albin Michel and Editions Robert, goes behind the scenes of the project to explore its three-year genesis and highlights the extensive artistic research behind the work in the form of preparatory collages.http://www.albin- michel.fr/ouvrages/polyphonies-9782226321626 Current lines of research into the dynamics of forms has led Verdier to explore possible links between music and painting, specifically between pictorial and sonic lines. In July, 2017, at the invitation of the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence and its Acad√©mie, Verdier set up an experimental studio/laboratory in painting and music, with the goal of creating a new 360¬∞ immersive film experience for public viewing at the 2018 edition of the Festival.http://culturebox.francetvinfo.fr/theatre/theatre- contemporain/video-360deg-paysages-sonores-de-fabienne-verdier-259859 As an artist in residence at the Juilliard School in New York City for several months in 2014, she worked with some of its foremost faculty members, including Darrett Adkins, Kenny Barron, William Christie, Philip Lasser and Edith Wiens, as well as with many students. A documentary by filmmaker Mark Kidel relating the extensive experiments carried out in Verdier's studio- laboratory at Juilliard was released in 2016.http://www.calliopemedia.co.uk/continuing-work-with-fabienne-verdier In 2014, the Pinakothek der Moderne of Munich invited Verdier to create an installation of seven works on the theme of transformation.

Energy Fields, Fabienne Verdier, p. 2, exhibition catalogue, 21 September-2 November, Galerie Jaeger Bucher, Paris In 2009, Verdier embarked on an intense period of research and painting. Long fascinated by the strength of the color spectrum but also the mystery of intriguing immobility in works by the 15th century Flemish primitives, she created a large body of sketches and paintings, drawing particular inspiration from six important works: Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1436) and Portrait of Margaret van Eyck (1439) by Jan van Eyck; Death of the Virgin (c. 1481) by Hugo van der Goes; the Moreel Triptych by Hans Memling (1484); and the Simon Marmion diptych Mater Dolorosa and Man of Sorrows (c. 1460).http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/alexia-guggemos/exposition- fabienne-verdier-maitres- flammands_b_2996535.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJq3Wh1meiA The Groeninge and Memling museums in Bruges would ultimately exhibit the results of Verdier's research side by side with their inspirations in the museum galleries.

As she was expanding her research into spontaneity, Verdier also turned her interest to early Italian frescos and specifically to Quattrocento masters. During this period, the Torlonia family in Rome commissioned her to create a contemporary fresco of monumental paintings (5m x 8m) for a reception room in the family palazzo. Her research related to the project was recorded in studio notebooks and reproduced in Fabienne Verdier, Palazzo Torlonia (2010), by Eric Fouache and Corinna Thierolf.http://exb.fr/fr/le-catalogue/45-palazzo-torlonia-fabienne- verdier.html In 2007, the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne (Centre Pompidou) in Paris acquired its first Verdier painting.https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/ressource.action?param.id=FR_R-4bdd1123d8caa9439b76410c9c535ce&param.idSource;=FR_O- cc748ce024d377ae7d67e8b233d59bcb In 2005, drawn by the energy and dynamism of the works shown at Verdier's first solo exhibition in Switzerland at the Alice Pauli Gallery in Lausanne, the Hubert Looser Foundation of Zurich commissioned her to create a series of paintings to resonate with Abstract Expressionist and Minimalist works in its permanent collection by American artists including John Chamberlain, Donald Judd, Willem de Kooning, Ellsworth Kelly and Cy Twombly.B√ºttner, Philippe (2013).

In 2002, following her return to France after nearly a decade of intense work and immersion in China, Verdier wrote about this apprenticeship inside a radically different system of thought. Her account, Passag√®re du Silence, published by Albin Michel in 2003, won several prizes, was translated into six languages and sold over 230,000 copies.http://www.albin-michel.fr/Passagere-du-silence-EAN=9782226141859 In 1985, at 22, Verdier left for China to study at the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute in Chongqing. She chose at the same time to work alongside and train with the last great Chinese painters who had survived the Cultural Revolution, who she persuaded to transmit their mastery of spontaneous painting and aesthetic theories despite continued bans.Verdier, Fabienne (2003).

Then she prepares the canvas by applying several layers of pigment and glaze in order to obtain the desired degree of vibration, saturation and depth of color. Finally, standing directly on the stretcher and using tools of her own invention, she shapes the paint matter to express fundamental life forces.https://www.artandonly.com/interview-with-artist- fabienne-verdier/ Selected exhibitions Solo 2019 Mus√©e Granet, Aix- en-Provence, France http://www.museegranet- aixenprovence.fr/expositions/actuellement/fabienne-verdier-sur-les-terres-de- cezanne.html 2019 Galerie Lelong, Paris, France https://www.galerie- lelong.com/fr/exposition/48/autour-dun-timbre/fabienne-verdier.html 2018 Galerie Lelong, Paris, France http://www.galerie- lelong.com/en/expositions.html 2017 Galerie Lelong, Paris, France http://www.galerie-lelong.com/en/exposition-fabienne-verdier-silencieuses-co- ncidences-374.html 2017 Mus√©e Voltaire, Geneva, Switzerland http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/fr/bge/ 2017 Galerie Alice Pauli, Lausanne, Switzerland http://www.galeriealicepauli.ch/expositions.htm 2016 Patrick Derom Gallery, Brussels, Belgiumhttps://www.patrickderomgallery.com/pastexhibitions 2016 Waddington Custot Galleries, London, United Kingdomhttp://www.waddingtoncustot.com/artists/104-fabienne- verdier/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/t-magazine/art/fabienne-verdier- rhythms-reflections-juilliard-experiment.html 2015 Galerie Alice Pauli, Lausanne, Switzerland 2014 Retrospective, Le French May, City Hall, Hong Kong, curated by Daniel Abadie 2013 Galerie Jaeger Bucher, Paris, France 2013 ‚ÄúFabienne Verdier, L‚ÄôEsprit de la Peinture, Hommage aux Ma√Ætres Flammands‚Äù, Groeninge Museum and Hans Memling Museum, Bruges, Belgium, curated by Daniel Abadie 2013 Art Plural Gallery, Singapore 2009 Galerie Jaeger Bucher, Paris, France 2007 Galerie Alice Pauli, Lausanne, Switzerland 2005 Galerie Alice Pauli, Lausanne, Switzerland Group 2019 ‚ÄúUn Autre Oeil\\", MASC, Sables d'Olonne, France 2019 ‚ÄúPicasso - Gorky - Warhol\\", Kunsthaus Zurich, Switzerland 2018 ‚ÄúPicasso - Gorky - Warhol\\", Kunsthalle Krems, Austria 2018 ‚ÄúUn Autre Oeil\\", Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Contemporain de Dunkerque, France 2017 ‚ÄúPassion de l'Art‚Äù, Mus√©e Granet, Aix-en-Provence, France 2017 ‚ÄúRestless Gestures‚Äù, National Museum of Art, Architecture & Design, Oslo, Norway 2017 ‚ÄúFabienne Verdier Meets Sigmar Polke.

The series stars Diane Kruger and Demi√°n Bichir in leading roles, and co-stars Ted Levine, Annabeth Gish, Thomas M. Wright, Matthew Lillard and Emily Rios in supporting roles. The complete series consists of two seasons of 13 episodes each. The series debuted on FX in the United States on July 10, 2013, and the series finale aired on October 1, 2014. The show was developed both in English and Spanish languages. The American version takes place on the U.S. and Mexican border where a murdered body on a bridge between El Paso and Ju√°rez (the Bridge of the Americas) bring together El Paso detective Sonya Cross (Kruger) who is mentored by Hank Wade (Levine) and Chihuahua State police detective Marco Ruiz (Bichir). The story parallels the investigation by El Paso Times reporters Daniel Frye (Lillard) and Adriana Mendez (Rios). The series was a critical success and received positive reviews throughout its run. After the first season maintained a modest audience that dropped by 42 percent by the second, the series was not renewed for a third season. Plot The Bridge follows two police detectives ‚Äì one Mexican, one from the U.S. ‚Äì and their joint effort to capture a serial killer who is operating in both countries when an American judge known for anti-immigration views is found dead on the bridge connecting El Paso, Texas, with Ju√°rez, Mexico, menacing both nations along the Texas‚ÄìChihuahua border. Detective Sonya Cross, of the El Paso Police Department, works with Chihuahua State Police Detective Marco Ruiz, who knows about the slippery politics of Mexican law enforcement. Ruiz's whatever-it-takes approach doesn't sit well with Cross, who has undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome or a similar autism spectrum disorder and a by-the-book attitude when it comes to the job. But the two put their differences aside to solve a string of murders on the border, which is already infected with issues that include illegal immigration, drug trafficking, violence and prostitution. Their investigation is complicated by the rampant corruption and general apathy among the Mexican authorities and the violence of the powerful borderland drug cartels. The show title refers to the Bridge of the Americas that serves as a border crossing between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, where the series is set. Production FX ordered the series' pilot episode in July 2012. Shooting for the pilot took place on location in the El Paso area and wrapped in December 2012. Critically acclaimed director Gerardo Naranjo, best known for 2011's Miss Bala, directed the pilot. Work on the remaining twelve season one episodes began in early April 2013. Meredith Stiehm, creator of Cold Case, and Elwood Reid served as the series' executive producers and head writers. The show is co-produced by Shine America and FX Productions for FX. Alex Plank of Wrong Planet served as the consultant for Sonya's Asperger syndrome. Shine America wanted Stiehm to begin the series on the Ambassador Bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, in order to mirror the original series' winter setting. However, Stiehm and Reid successfully argued to set their version in El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Ju√°rez at the Bridge of the Americas. In September 2013, the series was renewed for a second season of 13 episodes. After the first season, co- developer Meredith Stiehm departed the series to rejoin the writing staff of her previous TV series, Homeland, leaving Elwood Reid as the sole showrunner for the second season. Also, Matthew Lillard and Emily Rios, who had recurring roles in the first season, were promoted to series regulars for the second season. The series was canceled after two seasons. John Solberg, FX's Executive Vice President of Communications, said, \\"FX will not be moving forward with a third season of The Bridge. Creatively we're very proud of what we done. But this came down to the numbers, and they just weren't there.\\" Cast and characters Main cast * Diane Kruger as Det.

Episodes  Reception Critical response On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season scored 77 out of 100, based on 37 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season a 90% rating based on 42 reviews at an average score of 8 out of 10, with the consensus \\"A seductive crime drama, The Bridge draws viewers in with culturally conscious themes that combine intelligent mystery and spellbinding drama.\\" Chuck Barney from the San Jose Mercury News gave The Bridge its highest praise, saying: \\"FX may have struck dramatic gold again. This series is mesmerizing. It sucks you in like a good book and has you yearning for more.\\" Alan Sepinwall wrote, \\"With these characters, with this fascinating, complicated place ‚Äì and one that's at the forefront of so much of what we're talking about in real world politics... The Bridge is off to such an outstanding start.\\" Series co-creators Meredith Stiehm and Elwood Reid with cast members Diane Kruger and Demi√°n Bichir at the 73rd Annual Peabody Awards. Maureen Ryan from The Huffington Post commented: \\"Mismatched cops forced to work together is one of the oldest TV tropes in the book, but The Bridge builds such a realistic, detailed world around the detectives here that the dynamic is often fresh.\\" The Hollywood Reporters Tim Goodman called the series \\"mandatory viewing for drama lovers\\", adding, \\"but it will be interesting to see where the writers take it and whether they have the big-league ability to make the evident potential materialize. One thing they've hopefully learned is that sometimes holding back information isn't mysterious, it's just confusing.\\" Robert Bianco from USA Today thought there was \\"rich ground to explore in the problems Mexico faces and the responsibility we may bear for some of them\\", adding \\"but the show's clumsy attempt to boil that down to a catchphrase is offensive and silly, particularly as it has no real connection to the story being told.\\" The second season received a Metacritic score of 67 out of 100, based on 13 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". On Rotten Tomatoes the second season received an 86% rating based on 21 reviews at an average score of 7.5 out of 10 and the consensus reads, \\"Thanks to beautiful cinematography and unique, captivating characters, The Bridge is a chilling murder mystery, even if it meanders slightly.\\" Alan Sepinwall writing for HitFix hugely praised the season saying, \\"It's a show with a much stronger command of its subject matter and awareness of its own strengths and weaknesses‚Äìeven as The Bridge still seems to be stuck in that nebulous border region separating the pretty good from the genuinely great. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post also gave a positive review, \\"It moves along with purpose and energy, but it's often at its best when finding colorful details and or allowing small, telling moments to breathe.\\" New York Post reviewer Robert Rorke called the show \\"unique\\" and wrote, \\"Drug cartels, a room of shrink-wrapped bills (worth $60 million), body bags and buckets of blood are just some of the intriguing elements in this uniquely Mexican-American drama, where the layers of corruption on both sides of the border seem impenetrable.\\" Mike Hale of The New York Times gave a mixed to positive review saying, \\"The Bridge still feels like a show caught between two masters. It has a lot of the pieces it needs to actually be a compelling murder mystery‚Äìsome good performances in key roles; an evocative, sun-blasted look; and an ability (presumably Mr. Reid's) to concoct creepy, suspenseful scenes. Yet we're still waiting for it all to come together.\\" Awards In June 2013, the series was honored, along with five others, with the Critics' Choice Television Award for Most Exciting New Series. The pilot episode of the series received the 2013 Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing in Television: Long Form ‚Äì Dialogue & ADR from the Motion Picture Sound Editors society. The series won a 2013 Peabody Award, which noted that \\"its rare, non- stereotypical depiction of two cultures rubbing against and informing each other is as fascinating as the mystery.\\" References External links * Category:The Bridge (TV series) Category:2010s American crime drama television series Category:2010s American LGBT-related drama television series Category:2013 American television series debuts Category:2014 American television series endings Category:Works about Mexican drug cartels Category:American television series based on Danish television series Category:Lesbian-related television shows Category:Serial drama television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Spanish-language television programming in the United States Category:Peabody Award-winning television programs Category:Television shows set in Tijuana Category:Television shows set in Texas Category:FX Networks original programming Category:Autism in television ","title":"The Bridge (2013 TV series)"},{"id":"39057774","text":" Ribonuclease E is a bacterial ribonuclease that participates in the processing of ribosomal RNA (9S to 5S rRNA) and the chemical degradation of bulk cellular RNA.  Cellular localization  RNase E was suggested to be a part of the cell membrane protein complex, as it sediments with ribosomes and crude membranes. Microscopy has localized tagged RNase E to the inner cytoplasmic membrane or a helical cytoskeletal structure closely associated with the inner layer.  Protein structure  This enzyme contains 1,061 residues and separates into two distinct functional regions, which are a large domain located at the 5‚ÄôN-terminus and a small domain located at the 3‚Äô C-terminus. While N-terminal half forms a catalytic domain, C-terminal half forms a degradosome scaffolding domain. A metal-binding pocket separates them in the middle of the RNase E protein structure. Although degradosome formation does not play a key role for E. coli growth, the deletion of the C-terminal half has been found to decrease the rate of decay of some RNase E substrates. Ribonuclease E function in tetrameric conformation, which contains four subunits associate with each other to create a structure that looks like two scissors connected at the handle region. The scissor blade is made of a large domain, and the handle is made of the small domain. In the catalytic site of the large domain, there are four subdomains that include an RNase H subdomain, a DNase I subdomain, an S1 subdomain, and a 5‚Äô sensing region. These four subunits are divided base on their function and similarity to homologous structural folds. RNase H is located at the beginning of N-terminal and named after the RNase H endoribonuclease family since they share a similar structure; however, RNase H serves as a structural function rather than catalytic function because it is lack of active-site residue. Next, the S1 subdomain and 5‚Äô sensing region are implanted in RNase H fold. The RNase E S1 domain adopts an OB-fold in which flexible loops are attached to a well- ordered five-stranded Œ≤-barrel core. In the ribonuclease E, the S1 domain not only aids in the formation of the tetrameric quaternary structure by dimerization but also serves as a substrate-binding site to facilitate RNA hydrolysis by the catalytic domains within this tetrameric enzyme. With S1 subdomain, 5‚Äô sensing region functions as a substrate-binding site that helps to stabilize the target RNA molecule on one subunit so that the other subunit within a dimer can cleave the RNA of interest. The 5‚Äô sensing region located at a distance from the catalytic site, which resides on the DNase I subdomain. The last subdomain of the RNase E catalytic site is DNase I, which is named for its conformational similarity to an endonuclease structure that cleaves double-stranded DNA. In ribonuclease E, DNase I subdomain self-complements to dominate the dimer interface. Also, there is two magnesium ion binding site that mediates cleavage by hydrolytic attack of the RNA backbone and two zinc ion binding site that aids in stabilization of a dimer made of two subunits.  Function  Escherichia coli endoribonuclease E has a significant influence on gene expression. It is not only essential for the maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) but also the rapid degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) by hydrolysis reaction. In the maturation of rRNA precursor, the substrates for processing are not naked RNAs but somewhat incomplete, unmodified pre-rRNA-ribosomal protein complexes. Both pre-16S and pre-23S rRNAs are excised from the primary RNA-protein complex by RNase III, which activates subsequent steps in rRNA maturation by generating 5' monophosphorylated cleavage products. RNase E further shortens the 17S precursor of 16S rRNA. This action helps to facilitate 5' maturation of rRNA by RNase G and make two cleavages to excise pre-5S rRNA. In the case of tRNAs, approximately 50 of the 86 tRNA species in E. coli require RNase E. The ribonuclease E cleaves tRNA-containing primary transcripts in the 3' end of the tRNAs. These cleavages serve to separate individual tRNA precursors and to separate tRNAs from mRNAs or terminator sequences. The primary function of ribonuclease E is to cleave at a site beyond the mature 3' end to enable access by 3' exonucleases. In mRNA degradation, ribonuclease E recognizes and cleaves the single-stranded RNA in A- and U-rich regions. The RNase E catalytic domain binds selectively to 5‚Ä≤-monophosphate RNA termini but has a mode of cleavage in the 3‚Ä≤ to 5‚Ä≤ direction. RNase E can identify cleavage sites by a 3‚Ä≤ to 5‚Ä≤ scanning mechanism. The anchor of the RNase E to the 5‚Ä≤-monophosphorylated end of these substrates orients the enzyme for directional cleavages that occur in a processive mode. In the absence of RNA, the S1 subdomain and 5‚Ä≤ sensing site of RNase E are both exposed to the surrounding solvent, allowing RNA to bind readily. In the presence of RNA, target RNA binds to the combined S1 subdomain and 5‚Ä≤ sensor in the open configuration. The RNA is anchored primarily by the binding affinity of the 5‚Ä≤ sensor and oriented by the hydrophobic surface patch on the S1 subdomain. While the S1 subdomain is acting to orient the molecule, the 5‚Ä≤ sensing pocket likely contributes a significant portion of the substrate-binding affinity. These two sites hold the RNA while the fusion 5/S1 subdomain moves as a single complex into the closed configuration. It brings the substrate into proximity to the catalytic site where a hydroxyl group attacks the phosphate backbone by nucleophilic attack reaction. This response is mediated by magnesium ion. When the RNA of interest is cleaved, and the products of the reaction are eventually released as RNase E returns to the open configuration. Besides, RNase E can be self-regulated whereby the mRNA of ribonuclease E serves as a sensor for total cellular RNase E activity and thus limits RNase E activity due to the availability of substrates and changes of growth rate.  Comparison ribonuclease E of E. coli and other organisms  Based on the alignment for sequences of different bacteria correlated to ribonuclease E of Escherichia coli, it appears that about 70% of the sequences are highly conserved at the beginning of sequences and poorly conserved toward the end of sequences. When comparing the five other organisms‚Äô sequences to the sequence of the ribonuclease E, it looks like most of the sequences share the same residues at the N-terminal since the member from ribonuclease E/G family has the same hydrolyze function. In other words, the large catalytic domain of the ribonuclease E/G family member is almost the same. In contrast, the small structural domain, which is located at the C-terminus, is varied for different organisms since the small domain contains a structural sequence that serves as scaffolding for other enzymes. For instance, the ribonuclease E that is in the Cedecea davisae came from the S3JYP0 gene. When observing the structure of the ribonuclease E in Cedecea davisae, the catalytic domain contains S1 motif positioned at 31-119 residue on the sequence and a metal-binding site placed at the 404-407 residue on the sequences which are the same position as S1 domain and metal-binding domain on RNase E of Escherichia coli.  Evolutionary history  Ribonucleases (RNases) protein family involved mainly in RNA metabolism, playing essential roles in RNA maturation, RNA end- turnover, and the degradation of aberrant RNAs or expired species in the cell. They are classified into exoribonucleases and endoribonucleases based on their degradative activities. Ribonuclease E (RNase E) was initially discovered as an endoribonuclease from Escherichia coli strain K12. Based on DNA sequence analysis, orthologs of E. coli RNase E were predicted to exist among dozens of evolutionarily different bacterial species. In E. coli, the ribonuclease E enzyme plays an essential part in controlling cell viability by regulating RNA metabolism, such as the decay of most mRNAs and activates the processing of pre-tRNAs. Besides the degradative function, RNase E is necessary for the maturation of precursors of 5S ribosomal RNA, tRNAs, and the M1 RNA component of the RNase P ribozyme.

The RT enzyme is used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from the retroviral RNA genome. This process is called reverse transcription. To complete this complex process, the retroviral RT enzymes need to adopt a multifunctional nature. They therefore possess 3 of the following biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H, and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities ). Like all RNase H enzymes, the retroviral RNase H domain cleaves DNA/RNA duplexes and will not degrade DNA or unhybridized RNA.  Structure  The ribonuclease H domain from the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase protein (blue), with the four active-site carboxylate residues shown in magenta. The domain is superposed on the ribonuclease HI domain from Escherichia coli (tan), illustrating the presence of the C-helix and basic protrusion in the E. coli homolog. The crystal structure of the HIV reverse transcriptase heterodimer (yellow and green), with the RNase H domain shown in blue (active site in magenta spheres). The orange nucleic acid strand is RNA, the red strand is DNA. Although the RT structures from human, murine and avian retroviruses display different subunits, the relative sizes, orientation and connection of the DNA polymerase and RNase H domains are strikingly similar. The RNase H domain occupies ~25% of the RT protein C-terminal. The DNA polymerase domain occupies ~55% of the RT protein N-terminal. The RNase H domains of MMLV and HIV-1 RT enzymes are structural very similar to the Escherichia coli and Bacillus halodurans RNases H as well as to human RNaseH1. In general, the folded structures of retroviral RNase H domains take the form of 5-stranded mixed beta sheets flanked by four alpha helices in an asymmetric distribution. A notable difference between the various RNase H proteins is the presence or absence of the C-helix (present in E. coli, MLV and human RNases H, absent in HIV-1, B. halodurans and ASLV RNases H), a positively charged alpha helix also referred to as the basic loop or protrusion. It is believed to have a role in substrate binding. Typical retroviral genomic organization: The RNase H domain (RH - shown in black) is encoded as part of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene. RT together with protease (PR) and integrase (IN) are translated as the Gag polyprotein. UTR = Untranslated region; LTR = Long terminal repeat  Function  During reverse transcription of the viral genomic RNA into cDNA, an RNA/DNA hybrid is created. The RNA strand is then hydrolyzed by the RNase H domain to enable synthesis of the second DNA strand by the DNA polymerase function of the RT enzyme. In addition, retroviral virions package a single tRNA molecule that they use as a primer during reverse transcription of the viral genomic RNA. The retroviral RNase H is needed to digest the tRNA molecule when it is no longer needed. These processes happen in a Mg2+ dependent fashion. Retroviral RNases H cleave their substrates through 3 different modes: #sequence-specific internal cleavage of RNA [1-4]. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus enzymes prefer to cleave the RNA strand one nucleotide away from the RNA-DNA junction. #RNA 5'-end directed cleavage 13-19 nucleotides from the RNA end. #DNA 3'-end directed cleavage 15-20 nucleotides away from the primer terminus. The two end-directed modes are unique to the retroviral RNases H because of a number of effects of the associated polymerase domain of retroviral RT. In the more universal internal cleavage mode, the RNases H behave as typical endonucleases and cleave the RNA along the length of a DNA / RNA hybrid substrate in the absence of any ‚Äòend‚Äô effects.

Rollins is a case that was filed on behalf of the residents of Alsen (a small community located in East Baton Rouge Parish), Louisiana against Rollins Environmental Services, Inc., and (a toxic waste cleaning company). Although the decision in this case allowed the plaintiffs within this community to be certified as a class, and allowed them to be viewed as a unit when filing their lawsuit, and thereby reversing the decision that had been made at the trial and appellate level, the case was not reheard in the lower courts. Instead, Rollins Environmental Services, Inc. settled with the plaintiffs outside of court in 1987. Although this case is primarily cited for what a group of people need to do in order to obtain class certification, it is also often cited as one of the pivotal moments in the Environmental justice grass roots movement that has been occurring within communities of color. The people involved in the suit look at the way in which their community was disproportionately impacted by toxic waste polluters in light of their race and class, in comparison to communities that are composed of people who are racially and economically privileged and advocated for more considerate treatment by state regulators and operators of waste disposal plants. Through looking at the development of the McCastle v. Rollins lawsuit, one can see the way in which class, race, legal claims, community activism, public health and environmentalism can be viewed and used in conjunction with one another to protect the rights of people living within a given community. Background This area known as Cancer Alley is often cited as one of the most toxic areas in the country with residents claiming a host of ailments and health conditions. Cancer Alley is the 107 mile stretch along the Mississippi River that runs between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This area has over 150 environmental hazards and waste dumps that are located there. More than 60 percent of the facilities that release chemicals are located within communities that are populated by people of color (African Americans, Latinos, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans). Louisiana has policies and characteristics that are favorable to businesses. They are located off the Gulf of Mexico and are afloat in oil. In the 1960s, tax exemptions and business friendly policies that were made under Governor John McKeithen, attracted many businesses to this area of Louisiana. A lot of companies move their operations to that state to take advantage of business friendly standards and policies that take a relaxed view of environmental standards and health issues. As a consequence, the land in Louisiana is some of the most industrially injured land in the United States. More times than not, hazardous facilities were placed in areas that were composed primarily of people of color. Due to historical racism, people of color did not have a lot of political and social power and were unable to challenge the ways in which their communities were being changed. Often time local government and big business would exploit this group of peoples and continue racism that had occurred during colonial times. Rollins Environmental Services, Incorporated was a company that had the fourth largest landfill in the country in 1986. At that time, it represented 11.3 percent of the permitted hazardous-waste capacity in the United States. The Facility opened in 1969 and had been operating in the small town of Alsen. Alsen is a small community located in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. Before the civil war, it was known as the Mount Pleasant plantation; after the civil war, slaves that were freed from the Mount Pleasant plantation and from neighboring plantations came and settled in the area. The People who live there have a very close connection to the land. Beginning of the social movement The group involved in the McCastle case is located in Alsen. Around the time of the initial filing of the lawsuit in 1980, there were 1104 residents. African American composed 98.9 of those residents. More than 77 percent of the people who lived there owned their own homes even though it had started out as a rural community that was primarily composed of African Americans. William Fontenot, an environmental advocate, met with McCastle and a group of community members at her house in her living room to talk about the pollution that was creating the poisonous fumes. Many of the community members were not trusting of white people who came into their presence; there had been a history of whites just coming into black communities in order to obtain votes. Willie Fontenot was the one who linked the community group to the lawyers that would be able to help them push their lawsuit through the court system. He knew politicians and lawyers throughout Louisiana. This group of plaintiffs claimed that Rollins was land farming sludge that was being produced by Exxon Corporation. This pollution was causing a host of health issues within the community such as \\"headaches, chronic fatigue, cancer, and spontaneous nosebleeds\\". Mary McCastle, a 75-year-old grandmother, and a number of other local residents were determined to protect the health rights of other members within their communities. As a result, they formed the Coalition for Community Action. McCastle and other local residents began to record the impact that these facilities had on the community members and the physical landscape of their locals. As Mary McCastle stated: We had no warning Rollins was coming in here. When they did come in we didn't know what they were dumping. We did know that it was making us sick. People used to have nice gardens and fruit trees. They lived off their gardens and only had to buy meat. Some of us raised hogs and chickens. But not after Rollins came in. Our gardens and animals were dying out. Some days the odors from the plant would be nearly unbearable. We didn't know what was causing it. We later found out that Rollins was burning hazardous waste. Allen, Brenda: Uneasy Alchemy Page 42 This organization worked to have Rollins Environmental Services clean up some of the waste that they had disposed of for Exxon Mobil by reporting the practices of Rollins Environmental Services to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Even though residents were invited to watch Rollins Environmental Services clean up the waste that they had disposed of inappropriately, they didn't see much of the cleanup getting done. Consequently, the group of residents followed up and filed a lawsuit on behalf of community members who had been adversely impacted. Lawsuit A group of residents that lived in Alsen, an East Baton Rouge Parish, and Louisiana filed a lawsuit against a chemical land farming operation, Rollins Environmental Services. There were approximately 4,000 residents that were part of the claim. They lived adjacent or in close proximity of the Rollins center and claimed that the land farming \\"had polluted the air and caused them injury.\\" They were represented by Steve Irving and Dennis R. Whalen. There were two things that the claimants were trying to achieve. One was class certification and the other was to obtain damages and an injunction for the Rollins facility to stop their operation which was polluting the community. In terms of class certification at the trial court level, the group of plaintiffs was denied class certification because the court perceived their injuries to be too divergent, not easy to identify, and the plaintiffs wanted large damages. At the Appeal level, the court confirmed the findings of the trial court. The appeals court didn't think that dealing with the claims of the members of the community together would create judicial economy. The Supreme Court of Louisiana reversed the findings of the trial and appeals court and said that it would be impractical to have all of the separate plaintiffs file separate briefs since they are similar enough. In order to determine whether it was appropriate to deem the people involved in this case should be part of a larger class, the court went through a process of analysis. Common Character Analysis ( As laid out in La.C.C.P. articles 591(1) and 592 and exemplified in Guste v. General Motors Corp. 370 So. 2d 477, Williams v. State, 350 So.2d 131 (La.1977), and Stevens v. Board of Trustees, 309 So.2d 144 (La.1975)).The three Requirements are: 1\\\\. A class so numerous that joinder is impracticable, and 2\\\\. The joinder as parties to the suit one or more persons who are (a) Members of the class, and (b) So situated as to provide adequate representation for absent members of the class, and 3\\\\. A \\"common character\\" among the rights of the representatives of the class and the absent members of the class. The appellate acknowledged that the class in the Alsen case had the first two characters that are necessary to be accepted as a class but not the \\"common character\\" factor. Through doing an analysis of the Common Character, determined that the group of people who went to trial for this case fulfilled all of the qualities that would be necessary for a group of people to be considered a class. -Effecting Substantive law *Class actions deal with issues that may not otherwise be litigated *They allow the court to see what the ramifications of their decision will be on the interested plaintiffs and the liability on the defendant. *The interests of absentees would be taken into account -Judicial efficiency *Necessary to achieve economies of time, effort, and expense *The Supreme Court determined that the lower courts had mischaracterized the relationship of the relationship othe various people to one another. They claimed the same harms, the same causes of the harm, and lived within the general vicinity of one another. -Individual fairness *This involves the uniformity of the decision among the members of the class. *Each of the people in the class is asserting a similar, if not identical claim. Through walking through these claims, the court determined that it was practical for litigation to proceed as a class. The certification was approved and the plaintiff's case was sent to lower court to be reevaluated. In terms of the injunction and the damages, the case was remanded back to the lower court to determine what actions should be taken against the facility and what types of damages the members of the community would receive. Under the authority of 28 USCS ¬ß 1441, the court was able to assert the injunction so that the facility would stop emitting toxic fumes into the atmosphere. Aftermath of the case After the court decision that said that the group could be certified as a class, the case was settled outside of court in 1987. Each of the plaintiffs received between $500 and $3,000 dollars. The Alsen Community did not receive the health clinic that they had hoped to receive. Immediately after the suit, the performance of the facility did improve. Also it was perceived as a problematic depositor of chemical waste. In 1989 the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, that had members from the Alsen community who had been negatively impacted by environmental and health conditions, were able to successfully prevent the expansion of the Rollins' facilities. The Rollins Environment Services, Inc. facility that was at the center of the lawsuit is now closed. In 1992, The Coalition for Community Action was successful in obtaining a technical assistance grant (TAG) from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to obtain cleanup in an area called the Devil's swamp which is also located in the East Baton Rouge Parish. The Tulane Environmental Law Clinic has worked with the North Baton Rouge Environmental Association and has helped them deal with their claims. Social implications Although this was seen as a class action case, it was one of the first Environmental Justice Cases within the nation. The protests that occurred in Warren, North Carolina is often seen as the first environmental justice movement even though that protest started in 1982 and residents in Alsen began to take note of the negative health effects that Rollins Environmental Services in 1976. At the time that protests began in Alsen, people within the community didn't have many examples of people of color leading these movements. Mary McCastle would then prove to be a role model for African-American environmental activists in Louisiana years after the Rollins case was litigated and settled. After the community settled with Rollins, McCastle used her money to travel to different parts in the south, speak in front of churches and schools, and help people gain awareness about the environmental harms that were occurring in their communities. It has been hard for people who are negatively impacted by the polluters in Louisiana to obtain change. Many of the people who benefit from the plants being in Louisiana, white workers who are employed there and plant officials, are resistant to acknowledging that these industries create problems. Through the actions of the community, more attention was brought to how the Rollins facilities were operating. Before the filing and the realization of this lawsuit, the facilities were able to do whatever they want. One legacy of the environmental justice movement in Alsen was the fight against Supplemental Fuels incorporated (SFI). Although the company tried to locate its facilities in a community where they thought that people would not fight back, they were met by opposing black and white forces.

This enzyme also acts on bacterial rRNA. A ribosome-inactivating protein produced by the mold Aspergillus giganteus, alpha-sarcin cleaves the portion of ribosomal RNA that forms the small ribosomal substrate. The high specificity of alpha-sarcin and its efficiency of cleavage are point of study and also account for this protein's very high toxicity level.  Structure  It is believed that the tyrosine amino acid found along the amino acid sequence of alpha-sarcin allows for the specificity when alpha-sarcin binds to the rRNA. It is the alcohol group found on the tyrosine amino acid that allows for this binding. This was determined in tests that removed the alcohol group, replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine, and the binding affinity was greatly reduced. The region of the DNA that makes alpha-sarcin is highly conserved, along with the corresponding sequence on the targeted ribosome. The corresponding sequence on the targeted ribosome is a centered around a guanine nucleotide located on what is called the \\"bulged-G motif\\". Specificity Alpha-sarcin is remarkable in its cleavage specificity. It interacts with a single bond in the targeted ribosome and breaks it, causing the ribosome to be inactivated. The bond in question is the phosphodiester bond within the sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) of the rRNA. The SRL region of the RNA was named after the alpha-sarcin toxin that targets it. The targeted bond is located within the GAGA tetraloop of the RNA in between a guanine and adenine nucleotide. Other ribotoxins also cleave the RNA of the ribosomes, however there are many more points of cleavage- indicating much less specificity. The specificity of alpha-sarcin is so high, that alpha- sarcin can recognize the SRL segment of the ribosome without the rest of the ribosome present. SRLs fold independently, creating the same structure as when they are in a ribosome. This reaffirms the idea that it is the affinity of alpha-sarcin for this specific region of the ribosome that causes the two to bind and react. The key recognition nucleotide on the ribosome is a guanine nucleotide located six nucleotides upstream from the cleave site (this is the same as the above-mentioned \\"g-bulge\\" region). Conditions for reaction The conditions that allow for the recognition and cleavage include the salinity of the environment. With increased salt concentration, there is increased competition for the alpha-sarcin to reach the \\"G-bulge\\". This is due to the electrostatic interactions between the cationic side chains of the amino acids of the alpha-sarcin and the phosphates of the ribosome chain. More salt interferes with these two interactions. The overall rate constant for the SRL cleavage reaction is second order (k2/K1/2 of 108M-1s-1). This means the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentrations of the reactant squared. The rate does not appear to be dependent on physical steps, i.e. the two molecules being able to locate each other in solution is not a factor in how quickly they react. This was determined by observing the rate of the reaction under varying viscosities. The dissociation of the products, the separation of the two molecules, also has no effect on the rate. It is suggested that the rate determining step for SRL cleaves occurs within the chemical cleavage of the phosphodiester bond. Once the alpha-sarcin have cleaved the ribosome, the resulting pieces, P1 and P2 are cleaved further, with a particular affinity towards A and G sites. However, this later cleaving has a much lower rate of reaction.4 This further supports the notion that alpha-sarcin depends on the folded structure of the RNA for recognition and cleavage, but not necessarily the rest of the molecule. The cleavage rate for an unfolded ssRNA containing the GA sequence is three times less than the full and folded SRL sequence.

Early life  Jose Antonio Mijares was born in Santander, Spain, and came to Mexico City, and became a citizen of Mexico. He joined the Mexican Navy in 1842 and participated in the Naval Battle of Campeche, becoming a Lieutenant. Following the Texas Revolution, Mijares retired from the navy and married Dolores Aviles in June 1847. Jardin Cabenos Ilustres; Biographies; Lt. Jose Antonio Mijares (1819‚Äì1847) from mexican-folk-art-guide.com accessed on April 5, 2013.  Mexican War Service and Death  The looming outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War prompted him to join the Mexican Army. As a Lieutenant, he was sent to Baja California Sur, joining the command of Captain Manuel Pineda Munoz, who had defeated a U. S. Navy attempt to capture Mulege in the Battle of Mulege and was moving south to attack American forces in La Paz. Pineda sent Lt. Mijares and bajacalifornio guerrilla leader Jose Matias Moreno with about 100 men to San Jos√© del Cabo, where the U. S. Navy Commodore William Shubrick had left a garrison of four passed midshipmen and twenty marines, and twenty friendly bajacalifornios from the town, along with a 9-pound carronade under Lieutenant Charles Heywood. Upon reaching San Jos√© del Cabo on November 19, 1847 the force offered terms of surrender to Lt. Heywood, which were refused. The next night, the Mexicans launched their assault on the American positions in the town. Heywood's force barricaded in the priests house (nowadays the site of the Casa de la Cultura) and the surrounding houses. Mijares moved forward with a forlorn hope to seize the piece of artillery and distract the defenders from the main assault on the walls. In the attack, Lt. Mijares was severely wounded and his men seeing him fall, the attack faltered, and they were repulsed. Lt. Mijares died the next day.

It is among the best-known churches in Quito because of its large central nave, which is profusely decorated with gold leaf, gilded plaster and wood carvings. Inspired by two Roman Jesuit churches ‚Äî the Chiesa del Ges√π (1580) and the Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola (1650) ‚Äî la Compa√±√≠a is one of the most significant works of Spanish Baroque architecture in South America. It is Quito's most ornate church and (according to some observers) the country's most beautiful. Description Over the 160 years of its construction, the architects of La Compa√±√≠a incorporated elements of four architectural styles, although the Baroque is the most prominent. Mudejar (Moorish) influence is seen in the geometrical figures on the pillars; the Churrigueresque characterizes much of the ornate decoration, especially in the interior walls; finally the Neoclassical style adorns the Chapel of Saint Mariana de Jes√∫s (in early years a winery). The floorplan of La Compa√±√≠a makes a Latin Cross, with central, northern and southern arms; it has the conventional nave, transept, crossing, presbytery, antechamber to the sacristy, sacristy, and chapel. The central nave is topped by a 26-meter high barrel vault constructed of pumice and brick. This vault is decorated with plaster, polychrome and Mud√©jar figures in gold leaf. The skyline is capped by two green and gold domes. The carvings of La Compa√±√≠a‚Äôs main fa√ßade were executed entirely of Ecuadorian andesite stone. (Begun in 1722 by Father Leonardo Deubler, work was suspended in 1725 and taken up again in 1760 by Brother Venancio Gandolfi who finished it in 1765.) According to Jos√© Mar√≠a Vargas: ‚ÄúA simple comparison of dates explains the difference in styles between the body of the Church and the fa√ßade. While the structure of the Church reveals the Renaissance influence (that of Italy brought to Quito by Brother Marcos Guerra), that of the fa√ßade reflects the dynamism of the 18th century Baroque, instigated by Bernini‚Äôs solomonic columns of the Baldachin of the Basilica of Saint Peter in Rome‚Äù. La Compa√±√≠a‚Äôs columns, statues and larger details were executed in the quarry which the Jesuits had in the Hacienda de Yurac (in the nearby parish of Pintag). The rest of the material was brought from a quarry on the western slopes of El Panecillo, adjacent to the city. That fa√ßade, as it has come down to us, has more of the Italian Baroque than of the Spanish Plateresque and, with its high pilasters, a certain accent of the French Baroque. Design elements include a near symmetrical facade, Moorish influence in the nave, and artwork by artists of the Quito School. A sarcophagus with the remains of Ecuador's patron saint, Mariana de Jes√∫s de Paredes, is located in the base of the central altar. The interior of La Compa√±√≠a strongly resembles that of the Church of San Ignacio in Bogot√°. This similarity, particularly evident in the design of the stuccos, baseboards, molding and vaults, represents an enhancement of the scheme first employed in the older Bogot√° church. History Construction The first group of Jesuit priests arrived in Quito on 19 July 1586, in order to establish a church, a school and a monastery. Among this group were Juan de Hinojosa, Diego Gonz√°lez Holgu√≠n, Baltasar de Pi√±as and Juan de Santiago. Most sites for the construction of churches had been granted by the city council to the Franciscans, the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy, the Augustinians and the Dominicans. However, in 1587 the council granted land to the Jesuit order at the northwest corner of Plaza Grande (now Independence Square). When the Augustinians showed their displeasure with the decision, the Jesuits chose to settle in another lot located southwest of the Cathedral and Plaza. Nicol√°s Duran Mastrilli, a Jesuit priest from the Province of Naples, Italy, was appointed rector of the Jesuit College of Quito in 1602. Upon his arrival from Rome, he brought with him plans for the new Church of the Society of Jesus to be constructed in Quito. The plans for the church have been attributed to Domenico Zampieri, who also served as architect for the Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola in Rome. Construction began in 1605, with Mastrilli laying the first stone. The next documented architect was Gil de Madrigal, a Jesuit brother who arrived in Quito in 1634. The work gained momentum in 1636 with the arrival of Marcos Guerra, an Italian Jesuit priest who was also an architect and sculptor. The building was not completed until 1765. Later Mariana de Jes√∫s de Paredes (1618‚Äì45), the patron saint of Ecuador, was sanctified in La Compa√±√≠a which she chose to be her permanent home. La Compa√±√≠a served as the headquarters of the Jesuit order in Ecuador and also housed a school. After the expulsion of the Jesuits from Ecuador in 1767 by King Charles III, many texts describing the history and architecture of the structure were lost. During the colonial period, the bell tower of La Compa√±√≠a was the tallest structure in Quito. The original tower was destroyed by an earthquake in 1859. It was rebuilt in 1865, but it was destroyed a second time by another earthquake in 1868 and never rebuilt. The miracle of Our Lady of Sorrows reportedly occurred in the dining room of the Academy of Saint Gabriel on April 20, 1906. Another earthquake damaged the church in March 1987. This prompted another period of restoration, undertaken between 1987 and 2005.

Public health work Charles-Freeman lived in the United States while doing her bachelor's at the University of Miami and her Master of Public Health at Florida International University. She returned to Jamaica for her doctorate in environmental and public health at the University of the West Indies, where she wrote her dissertation on the health effects of the Halse Hall bauxite mines and alumina refineries on residents of Clarendon Parish. Her study of 2,559 people found a significantly elevated incidence of asthma, sinusitis, and allergies among the residents, and recommended corrective actions. Her work faced significant opposition from industry, with Jamalco threatening to cut off the water supplies of study participants, while other government-linked companies refused to disclose their monitoring data to her. After graduating from the University of the West Indies, Charles-Freeman worked as the director of health care with Food for the Poor. She would go on to complete a master's degree in counselling psychology at the Northern Caribbean University in 2010. Later that year, she founded the Phoenix Counselling Centre, an organisation which aims to improve the physical, emotional, psychological, and social well-being of inner-city families; her work there includes play therapy with disadvantaged children. In government and politics Charles-Freeman rose to public attention through her work with the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission (JADCO), of which she served as executive director from the passage of The Anti-Doping in Sport Act (2008) until her resignation in September 2011. Under Charles-Freeman's tenure, JADCO implemented programmes to combat doping in sport as mandated by the World Anti-Doping Agency, focusing particularly on education of junior athletes. In 2010, she began efforts to introduce doping control in schools, as well as to expand out-of-competition testing. A major test for her during her work with JADCO was the case she pursued against Steve Mullings, whose positive test for a banned substance resulted in his disqualification from the 2011 World Championships in Athletics in Daegu, South Korea. After stepping down from her position at JADCO, Charles-Freeman ran in the 2011 election as the JLP candidate for East St Thomas, succeeding Jairzenho Bailey as the JLP's caretaker in the constituency. She renounced U.S. citizenship in August that year to qualify for nomination. Charles-Freeman faced off against Fenton Ferguson of the People's National Party in the election; Ferguson was the man who had originally defeated her father Pearnel Charles in the 1993 election which ended the JLP's forty-five year hold on the same East St Thomas constituency. In the end, Ferguson defeated Charles-Freeman, though by just 8,018 votes to Charles-Freeman's 7,547, a far smaller margin than the two thousand votes he had originally predicted. Ferguson credited Charles- Freeman's strong performance to efforts at improving turnout among erstwhile JLP voters who had not cast ballots in a long time. Personal life Charles- Freeman is the daughter of JLP stalwart Pearnel Charles. She was married to Horace Freeman, with whom she has two children.

The media used was a purple color to illustrate the resulting pattern, normally a transparent media would be used. A spiral plater is an instrument used to dispense a liquid sample onto a Petri dish in a spiral pattern. Commonly used as part of a CFU count procedure for the purpose of determining the number of microbes in the sample.J. E. Gilchrist, J. E. Campbell, C. B. Donnelly, J. T. Peeler, and J. M. Delaney \\"Spiral Plate Method for Bacterial Determination\\", Appl Microbiol. , 1973 February; 25(2): 244‚Äì252., In this setting, after spiral plating, the Petri dish is incubated for several hours after which the number of colony forming microbes (CFU) is determined. Spiral platers are also used for research, clinical diagnostics and as a method for covering a Petri dish with bacteria before placing antibiotic discs for AST.  Mode of action  The spiral plater rotates the dish while simultaneously dispensing the liquid and either linearly moving the dish or the dispensing tip. This creates the common spiral pattern. If all movements are done in constant speed, the spiral created would have a lower concentration on the outside of the plate than on the inside. More advanced spiral platers provide different options for spiral patterns such as constant concentration (by slowing down the spinning and / or the lateral movements) or exponential concentration (by speeding up the spinning and / or the lateral movements).  In food and cosmetic testing  Spiral plating is used extensively for microbiological testing of food, milk and milk products and cosmetics. It is an approved method by the FDA. The advantage of spiral plating is less plates used versus plating manually because different concentrations are present on each plate. This also makes it harder to count the colonies and requires special techniques and equipment.  Stand-alone vs. Add-on  Spiral platers are either available as stand-alone instruments that are fed manually with plates and samples or fed automatically using dedicated stackers. Alternatively spiral platers are available as integrated devices as part of larger automated platforms. In this case a larger workflow is often automated, e.g. plating, incubation and counting.

He supposed his unique Japanese painting \\"Neo-Nihonga\\" which revives Japanese traditional paintings as a contemporary art. And in 2000 he also created his new style \\"Butouha\\" which shows the resistant attitude for authoritative art system through his paintings. He currently lives and works in Saitama, Japan and is represented by the Mizuma Art Gallery in Tokyo. In 2010 he proposed a new Japanese art scheme named \\"BASARA\\" which is extravagant and extraordinary and embodies a Samurai aesthetic like \\"Basara\\" in Nanboku dynasty era and \\"Kabuki-mono\\" in the end of Sengoku era.  Neo Nihonga (Neo Japanese-style painting)  \\"Neo Japanese-style painting\\" is an art concept, founded by Tenmyouya Hisashi in 2001. It is an antithesis to a modern Japanese-style painting. He thinks a modern Japanese-style painting whose role as an opposite concept of a modern Western-style painting ended sticks to use a traditional painting materials such as mineral pigments, glue and ink. On the other hand, Neo Japanese-style painting is a new one, using a new material like acrylic paint etc. Also it refers some features of Japanese art such as a traditional Japanese line as well as its decorative, symbolic and playful ones. As for subjects, it intends to quote a Japanese traditional essence and express real Japanese contemporary art. Neo Japanese-style painting is a suggestion, suspecting the concept of \\"modern Japanese-style painting\\" which was made and twisted artificially in Meiji age. And it offers another possibility for a Japanese contemporary art history. Moreover, in Neo Japanese-style painting, classic Japanese paintings and styles before Meiji age are respected and modernized. In short, Neo Japanese-style painting takes over spirits of Ukiyo-e and the other Japanese classic painting and develop them.  BASARA  \\"Basara\\" is an art concept suggested by Tenmyouya Hisashi in 2010. The term \\"Basara\\" refers the family of beauty that with innovative unprecedented beauty, including the basara of the Nanbokucho Period, the kabukimono of the end of the Warring States Period, the ukiyoeshi of the end of the Edo period and Japanese recent youth culture with bad and decorative tastes. He regard the culture stands on the opposite end of the spectrum from wabi sabi and is incompatible with Otaku culture. Also he aims that such an aspect connects Japanese culture and history more directly to make an original Japanese art story. As for \\"Basara\\", deliberately he avoids too introvert (he thinks of it as one of weaÔΩãness of Japanese art) and often quotes Japanese historical elements. Indeed, \\"Basara\\" covers wide range, ancient culture, samurai culture and recent youth culture in Japan. Especially \\"Basara\\" focuses on street culture or samurai culture in the end of the Warring States Period or the end of the Edo period which has been estimated low for a long time. Avant-garde artist Taro Okamoto once separated Japanese art into the two categories of \\"Yayoi-like\\" art characterized by grace and delicate features, and \\"Jomon-like\\" art characterized by dynamic and innovative features. The term \\"Basara\\" is an adopted and developed version of Taro's concept of \\"Jomon- like\\" art, which is excessive in beauty yet innovative. Implicitly he criticizes a conservative attitude which just receives an established value blindly and avoids taking a risk for a new unique things. He published an art book \\"BASARA Japanese art theory crossing borders: from Jomon pottery to decorated trucks\\", which has more details with affluent photos and Japanese and English texts.

Early life and education Rizwan‚Äìul‚ÄìHaq grew up in Karachi and later Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and achieved his early education from Convent of Jesus and Mary, Karachi and higher education from St. Mary‚Äôs Academy, Rawalpindi. Before embarking on his career in music, he did his BSC degree in business management from University of Essex, England. He cites Carlos Santana, Bee Gees, ABBA and Nazia and Zoheb as his major influences during the youth. Vital Signs After the departure of Salman Ahmad, Rohail Hyatt's childhood friend Rizwan‚Äìul‚ÄìHaq was asked to join the band as lead guitarist. Back in 1991, Rizwan had just returned from the UK. Eagerly looking for a job, he ran into Rohail Hyatt ‚Äì the founding member and producer of Pakistan‚Äôs biggest pop band, Vital Signs. Rizwan left Islamabad for Karachi to join the band and the Signs began work on their third album in Rohail Hyatt's studios, Pyramid Studios, in 1993. The third album Aitebar, which soon outsold its predecessor, Vital Signs 2, was an ultimate success. The Signs then started their nationwide tour and collaborated with Shoaib Mansoor who directed \\"Guitar '93, a compilation of videos of Vital Signs' biggest hits thus far. It shot across the four provinces and was financed by Pepsi Pakistan Inc. Made for PTV, Guitar '93 was an entertaining document of the band's progress as one of the best pop/rock acts in Pakistan. With the release of Guitar'93, it was Rizwan who gained a lot of publicity and notability, and Signs also played their highest number of concerts in 1993. The biggest took place at the KMC Stadium in Karachi, a mega-concert headlined by the Signs and also consisting of performances from The Milestones, Awaz and the newly formed rock band, Arsh. Former member Salman Ahmad was present in the audience. It was after this concert Rohail first started to show signs of agitation regarding his growing dissatisfaction with Rizwan‚Äìul‚ÄìHaq's playing and his expenses. The success of Aetibar and Guitar'93 marked a great opportunity for Signs. The Signs marked its very first international tour to US in 1993, becoming the first Pakistan musical act to do so. In 1994, the band did not extend the contract for its guitarist, Rizwan‚Äìul‚ÄìHaq, despite his urgings. Rizwan was relieved and, according to Rohail Hyatt, \\"shown the door\\" after which Hyatt chose technical guitar whiz Aamir Zaki to become the band's new lead guitarist. When asked about his journey in Vital Signs, Rizwan‚Äìul‚ÄìHaq said: ‚ÄúI have beautiful memories of my time with the Signs. In fact, I met the love of my life, my wife for the past 27 years, while on a tour with the Signs.‚Äù Though the band's demise was never officially announced, by 1998 when the Signs were offered a deal by Pepsi Pakistan Inc. for another album, Rohail declined, signaling the end of Vital Signs. 1995‚Äìpresent: Teri Gali and Gemini Studios After recording the last album for Vital Signs in 1995, Rizwan‚Äìul‚ÄìHaq left the band and briefly worked as a music composer and recording producer for the PTV. He soon went solo after the departure from Vital Signs and his solo debut single, Teri Gali, became a hit on MTV India. Following few moderately received covers, he went on to make tunes for television commercials and sound tracks for the movies. He also found passion in collecting music memorabilias and guitars ‚Äî a total of 30 vintage Gibson Les Pauls.

Dubbed the \\"Foundation of Excellence\\", the school attracts pupils from all social classes in Kisumu. Some of the school's first influential head teachers and administrators include Mr. V. Z.

Their illustrious administration styles coupled with discipline attracted other like minded teachers who propelled the school into an academic oasis not only in Kisumu, but the entire Nyanza Province.

The school has two streams, named in Kiswahili after Africa's big cats \\"Simba\\" - Lion and \\"Chui\\" - leopard.

Gal ‚Äì Herr. Karl M√ºller Verlag, Erlangen 1994, , pg.12.  Life and work  At the age of sixteen, he went to Dresden to inquire about the possibility of being admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts. After some preparatory studies and submissions, he became a student of the Academy's Director, Giovanni Battista Casanova, a brother of the famous adventurer, Giacomo Casanova. His first exhibit at the Academy, in 1794, drew much positive attention. He completed his work there shortly after and went on a study trip to Danzig, Narva and Memel, then back through Berlin to Dresden. In 1796, he was awarded an annual government pension of 100 Thalers. From 1798, he moved frequently, to Halle (1798), Leipzig (1799), Vienna (1799), Berlin (1800), Paris (1801) and finally to Rome (1803), painting numerous portraits all along the way. Shortly after arriving in Rome, however, he fell ill with typhus and died. He was interred near the Pyramid of Cestius at the Protestant Cemetery. At the time of his death, he was engaged to the singer and composer, Louise Reichardt; daughter of the composer, Johann Friedrich Reichardt. His works include an altarpiece at the church in Reichenau (1798) and the canvas \\"Orpheus ‚Äì Lament Before the God of the Underworld\\", which he had sent to Dresden for an exhibition, shortly before his death.

A story of a princess who fights injustice as the masked crusader Hunterwali (lit. \\"lady with the whip\\"), the film propelled Nadia and the Wadia brothers of Wadia Movietone to fame. Hunterwali was the first lead role for Nadia. She performed many stunts in the film which were applauded by the audience. The film, an expensive venture, was a blockbuster. It inspired numerous products, incorporating Hunterwali in their brand names. Because of the movie's success, Nadia became a cult icon and starred in numerous stunt films, becoming Indian cinema's \\"earliest and most popular stunt actress\\". A sequel to the film; Hunterwali Ki Beti, was released in 1943, which made the former the first Indian movie ever to have a sequel. Plot The story begins on a stormy night, with a prologue explaining that Krishnavati and her infant son are getting evicted from her house by the Prime Minister (Vazier), Ranamal. Earlier, Ranamal had also had her brother murdered. The film switches to 20 years later when Krishnavati's son Jaswant is an adult. The royal car hits Jaswant in an accident. Then the scene leads to Princess Madhuri (Fearless Nadia) offering Jaswant compensation in the form of gold for the injury caused. Jaswant gallantly refuses the gift and the princess is attracted to him. The villain Ranamal also has a crush on the princess and wants to marry her. This proposal is opposed by her father the king who is imprisoned by Ranamal. Madhuri, assumes the role of \\"Hunterwali\\", a masked vigilante, the \\"protector of the poor and punisher of evildoers\\". She then goes around performing stunts like jumping over a moving carriage and then defeating 20 soldiers in one sweep with swashbuckling whipping style. She does not spare Jaswant either as she steals his prized possession, a horse called \\"Punjab\\", but soon gives it back to him. Jaswant plots his vendetta and finds Madhuri bathing nude in the river and kidnaps her and gifts her to Ranamal for a reward, but she later escapes. At the end, Madhuri and Jaswant join hands to fight Ranamal together and defeat him.NY Times Cast The members of the cast were: * Fearless Nadia (Mary Evans) as Princess Madhuri aka Hunterwali * Boman Shroff, as Jaswant * Jaidev, as Cunnoo, Hunterwali's sidekick * Sharifa, as Krishnavati, mother of Jaswant * Master Mohammed as the King * John Cawas * Gulshan * Sayani * Atish Production Shot from the film. Hunterwali was a Black and White film running for 164 minutes.CITWF During the production stage, there was an objection to the film's title. Language pundits objected to the blending of two words; Hunter, an English word denoting \\"whip\\" and wali, which was a Hindi word made a corrupted hybrid which did not do justice to either language. The main character in the film, Hunterwali/Madhuri, is the feisty and blue eyed beauty, Nadia in the disguise of a man. Mary Evans aka Nadia, an Australian entered Indian cinema in 1934 and had acted in two films, Desh Deepak and Noor-e-Yaman, before Hunterwali. Hunterwali was the first lead role of Nadia. Her character for the role had evolved over years with her training in riding, as a dancer, a fitness freak, a circus artist and as a theatre artist during the 1920s and early 1930s, which was accentuated by a svelte heavily built but supple Amazonian athletic figure with blond hair and blue-eyes. All these qualities made her an instant attraction to the Wadia brothers of Wadia Movietone, though initially they were sceptical about a white woman \\"breaking into a Brown male bastion\\" of stunt films and acceptance by the conservative audience during the British Raj. The producers Wadia Movietone (founded by the brothers JBH Wadia and Homi Wadia) specialised in stunt-based and mythological films at that time. The story line was developed by J.B.H. Wadia to suit Nadia's character. The plot is developed around the historical theme of a brave fearless Indian girl who forgoes her royal luxurious lifestyle to be a people's person. The film was directed by Homi Wadia (Nadia's future husband) who also wrote the screenplay for the film, with Joseph David writing the dialogue. The concept of Hunterwali was inspired by Hollywood films like Robin Hood starring Douglas Fairbanks. Inspired by the film serial The Perils of Pauline, Nadia did all her stunts. In the role of a masked avenging angel, the film pictured Nadia as a swashbuckling princess in disguise. In this disguise, she straddled on her horse around the countryside chasing enemies, wearing her hot pants, \\"with her big breasts and bare white thighs, and when she was not swinging from chandeliers, kicking or whipping men, she was righting wrong with her fists and imperious scowl.\\" The film is embellished with many bhajans by Govind Gopal. One of the popular songs starts with \\"Hunterwali hai bhali duniya ki leth,\\" which is a glorification of Hunterwali. Master Mohammed, who acted as the king who also provided the music score. The Wadias had spent a fortune not only in making the film but also in its publicity campaign. It was premi√®red in Bombay at the Super Cinema, on Grant Road. It took six months to make with a budget of Rs. 80,000, which was a fortune. There were no takers for releasing the film, in view of adverse comments about the blonde beauty of a heroine, so the partners pooled their resources and launched a huge publicity campaign. As a result of which, there were huge crowds to see the film on its opening night and thereafter it was a runaway success. Reception and legacy Hunterwali was a runaway success and a bonanza in terms of money earned, as it ran for 25 weeks making record earnings for the year. This was Nadia's and Wadia Movietone's first big success. Nadia as Hunterwali/Princess Madhuri was the highlight of the film, despite her inadequacy in rendering dialogues in Hindi. Both her stunts, on trains and horse carriages and with animals, and her blond appearance were well received by the audience. A popular scene in the film was the moment when Hunterwali announced in the third reel that \\"aajse main Hunterwali hoon\\" (\\"from today, I am the woman with the whip\\"), which resulted in the maximum cheering from the crowd. Another memorable scene, presented as tableaux, is that of Hunterwali lifting a man over her head with the sidekicks pirouetting around her, performing gymnastics, in the middle of a chase; this type of scene would become a staple of most of her later films. Hunterwali was the most popular character of its time and was listed as \\"Bollywood's best loved character\\" in 100 years of Indian cinema by CNN-IBN. Hunterwali's yell in the film \\"hey-y-y\\" became a catchphrase. Following the success of the film, Nadia became known as \\"Hunterwali Nadia\\" and went on to become a legendary figure in Indian cinema. Hunterwali Nadia emerged as a feminist icon of Hindi cinema, portrayed as the one who would break the glass ceiling and overturn the patriarchal order. Despite her accented Hindi, Nadia achieved great stardom in the wake of the film, becoming the highest-paid actress in the Indian film industry for the next two decades. Nadia's success and popularity were furthered by similar performances in films of the same genre ‚Äì also huge hits ‚Äì in the next few years. Hunterwali's adulation was exploited to promote various products with the name \\"Hunterwali\\" prefixed to the brand name, such as whips, belts, playing cards, chappals, bags, bangles, match boxes, shoes, shirts, etc. Wadia later regretted that he did not patent the word \\"Hunterwali\\", which could have brought him a fortune in royalties. The suffix of the word, wali, also became a fad with film producers who named many stunt films using it, like Cyclewali, Chabukwali and Motorwali. Wadia himself capitalised on the Hunterwali icon by releasing a sequel, Hunterwali Ki Beti (\\"daughter of Hunterwali\\"), with Nadia in 1943. Like Hunterwali, the sequel became a blockbuster. A 62-minute retrospective documentary titled Fearless: the Hunterwali Story was made by Nadia's grandnephew Riyad Vinci Wadia in 1993 on the actress' life. In April 2013, during the centenary festival of Indian cinema in Delhi, the film along with the silent classic, Diler Jiger (1931, Gallant Hearts), was shown in the \\"tent cinema\\" erected as a part of the celebrations. Vishal Bharadwaj's Hindi movie Rangoon supposedly portrays her life and times with Kangana Ranaut playing Nadia's role.

Early life Sir Herbert James Gunn (also known as Sir James Gunn) was born in Glasgow on 30 June 1893, the son of Richard Gunn, a draper, and Thomasina Munro. He studied for several years at the Glasgow School of Art and the Edinburgh College of Art. In 1911, he went to the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris where he studied under Jean-Paul Laurens.Online Galleries After he left Paris, Gunn travelled to Spain and then spent time in London, where he mostly painted landscapes. At the outbreak of the First World War, Gunn initially joined the Artists Rifles. He subsequently received a commission in the 10th Scottish Rifles and saw active service in France. During the conflict he continued to paint, most notably a work depicting troops on the eve of the Battle of the Somme. Painting career Gunn began as a landscape painter and traveled widely, exhibiting Paintings of Rome etc at the Fine Art Society in 1929.Christie's During the 1920s, he increasingly concentrated on portrait painting and after 1929 he devoted himself exclusively to portraits.Panter & Hall In November 1939, Gunn offered his services to the War Artists' Advisory Committee and subsequently received three portrait commissions from them. During WWII he lived with his family in Carsethorn, a seaside village on the Solway in Kirkcudbrightshire. Gunn's paintings are on show in a number of galleries and his 1953 portrait of Queen Elizabeth II is in the Royal Collection. He also painted notable portraits of King George V, Agnes Catherine Maitland (now in Somerville College's dining hall), and also of Harold Macmillan, in his role as Chancellor of Oxford University. He was elected President of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters in 1953, a post he held until his death. He was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy in 1953 and a full academician in 1961. Gunn was knighted for services to painting in 1963. An 80-page catalogue of his work which were exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh from December 1994 to February 1995, was published by the National Galleries of Scotland in 1994.Amazon Family life Gunn married Gwendoline Thorne in 1919 and they had three daughters. He divorced his first wife who ran off with Sir Arthur Whinney. Gunn subsequently married Pauline Miller with whom he had a son and another daughter.Eaton Square Pauline was the model for a number of his paintings, including his 1961 diploma submission to the Royal Academy. Gunn died in London on 30 December 1964. A Requiem Mass for the repose of his soul was held at the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, London in January 1965.

The primary metals in this category are magnesium-based and iron-based alloys, although recently zinc has also been investigated. Currently, the primary uses of bioresorbable metals are as stents for blood vessels (for example bioresorbable stents) and other internal ducts. Background Although bioabsorbable polymers and other materials have come into widespread use in recent years, degradable metals have not yet had the same success in the medical industry. Driving force for development The driving force behind the development of bioresorbable metals is primarily due to their ability to provide metal-like mechanical properties while degrading safely in the body. This is especially relevant in orthopaedic applications, where although many surgeries only require implants to provide temporary support (allowing the surrounding tissue to heal), the majority of current bio-metals are permanent (e.g. stainless steel, titanium). Degradation of the implant means that intervention or secondary surgery will not be necessary to remove the material at the end of its functional life, providing significant savings in both cost and time for the patient and health care system. In addition, the corrosion products of current bio-metals (which will still corrode in the body to some degree) can generally not be considered biocompatible. Potential applications There are a number of applications for biodegradable metals, including cardiovascular implants (i.e. stents) and orthopedics. It is in this latter category where these materials offer the greatest potential. Bioresorbable metals are able to withstand loads that would destroy any currently available polymers, and offer much greater plasticity than bioceramics, which are brittle and prone to fracture. A well- designed implant could provide the exact mechanical support needed for different areas (through alloying and metal working), and load would be transferred to the surrounding tissue over time, letting it heal and reducing the effects of stress shielding. A summary of the primary benefits and drawbacks of magnesium biomaterials has been provided by Kirkland. Considerations and issues facing bioresorbable metal development Changing shape over time It is the same advantage that bioresorbable metals possess over non-degradable current materials, their biodegradability, that poses the greatest challenges to their development and wider use. The degradable nature of any implant means that their shape and thus mechanical properties will change through its lifetime. This means that lifecycle analysis must be performed on any implant, especially one designed for orthopedic applications where failure could result in death. Lack of standards Current standards for corrosion of metals have been found to not apply well to bioresorbable metals during in vitro testing. This is a significant problem as the majority of tests performed in the research community are a mix of other standards from both the biomedical and the engineering (e.g. corrosion) communities, often making comparison between results difficult. Corrosion Product Toxicity Even though all elements in a bioresorbable metal may themselves be considered biocompatible, the morphology and elemental makeup (or combination of elements) of the degradation products may cause adverse reactions in the body. In addition, the rapid evolution of hydrogen gas that is concomitant with Mg-alloy degradation may cause addition problems in vivo. It is therefore crucial to intricately understand the corrosion of each implant and the products that are release, in light of their toxicity and the likelihood of inflammation. The majority of studies in the literature have focused on elements that are known to be biocompatible or abundant in the body, such as calcium and zinc. Potential bioresorbable metal candidates Although all metals will degrade and eventually disappear inside the body through the processes of corrosion and wear, true bioresorbable metals must have an appreciable degradation rate to allow the implant to be absorbed in a practical amount of time in reference to their application. Also, any degradation product would have to be safely metabolized or excreted by the body to avoid toxicity and inflammation. Magnesium Perhaps the most widely investigated material in this category, magnesium was originally investigated as a potential biomaterial in 1878 when it was used by physician Edward C. Huse in wire form as a ligature to stop bleeding. Development continued into the 1920s, after which Mg-based biomaterials fell out of general investigation due to their poor performance (likely due to impurities in the alloys drastically increasing corrosion). It was not until the late 1990s that interest started to pick up again, spurred by the availability of ultra-high purity Mg, which significantly increases its longevity inside the body. Currently, most research on Mg is focused on reducing and controlling the rate of degradation, with many alloys corroding too rapidly (in vitro) for any practical application. Iron The majority of iron-based alloy research has been focused on cardiovascular applications, such as stents. However this area receives much less interest in the research community than Mg-based alloys. Zinc To date little work has been published on the use of a primarily zinc-based biomaterial, with corrosion rates found to be very low and zinc within a tolerable toxicity range Biodegradable bulk metallic glasses Although strictly speaking a side- category, a related, relatively new area of interest has been the investigation of bioabsorbable metallic glass, with a group at UNSW currently investigating these novel materials.

It specializes in treating eye diseases and ailments through Ayurveda. The 350-bed hospital is situated in a campus. Late Dr N P P Namboothiri founded the hospital along with his elder brother Narayanan Namboothiri. Over 400 years of traditional wisdom & extensive clinical experience, handed down through generations was combined with modern diagnostic techniques to create the facility. Dr. Narayanan Namboothiri, MD(Ayu) is the chief physician of Sreedhareeyam now. History The hospital was created through the efforts of the Nelliakattu Mana, a traditional household of Vaidhyas (physicians). The ancestors of Nelliakattu Mana inherited knowledge and skills in the branch of Ayurveda called \\"Shalakya Tantra\\" which was handed down through generations. Shalakya Tantra is the branch of ayurveda which deals with ailments to the organs above the neck in human body. The ancients of the mana is believed to have bestowed with the knowledge of ayurveda by Maharshi Parashurama which was handed down through centuries. The Ayurvedic physicians of the Nelliakattu Mana in the later generations became professionally qualified doctors with academic achievements which was further enhanced by extensive clinical experience and research. They brought in the goodness of scientific advancements in diagnostic technology to the traditional body of knowledge in Ayurveda to create indigenous treatments and remedies. It no longer relies on the brilliance of doctors to diagnose the ailment, instead it uses all possible diagnostic technologies which the science has put forward and then brings in the remedial measures from the treasured knowledge of Ayurveda. Diseases treated Sreedhareeyam Ayurvedic Eye Hospital and Research Centre The core focus of the institution is eyecare. Classical traditional ayurvedic methods enhanced by research assisted variations and also clinically proven medications has enabled Sreedhareeyam to yield unparalleled results in the field of ophthalmology.

Compared to the Group of 190 set up by the pro- democracy groups, it was on the conservative side of debates over the constitutional reform, the Hong Kong Basic Law and the future of Hong Kong. History It was sometimes confused with the Business and Professional Group of the Basic Law Consultative Committee which was founded in April 1986. It countered the Group of 190 which made up of more liberal-minded community representatives, social workers and professional in the BLCC. It disagreed with the relatively radical demands of the Group of 190 and accepted limited changes would ensure the \\"stability and prosperity\\" and \\"high degree of autonomy\\" of Hong Kong. The group had concentrated on influencing the drafting of the Basic Law and failed to reach a single consensus with the Group of 190 which led directly to the success of highly conservative Cha proposal come up by Louis Cha. The group also used its stronger financial base to lobby against extensive democratic change. It major contribution to debate over the first draft of Basic Law was a highly emotive and misleading video showing democratic activity as synonymous with rioting and anarchy. The group hired a public relations firm to make a video which, controversially and somewhat illogically, warned of the dangers of direct elections by showing, among other salutary examples, film clips of South Korean students throwing petrol bombs. The Business and Professional Group, part of the Group of 89, published a pamphlet entitled A Proposal for the Future Structure of the Hong Kong SAR Government. The proposals favoured close limited on the franchise, the retention of an elite system of the government, the avoidance of party politics, and the maintenance of an independent judiciary. The group proposed a conservative constitution of electing the Chief Executive and Legislative Council after 1997, a legislature with no more than 25% elected seats and chief executive elected by a 600-member electoral college, in contrary to the more progressive proposal of the pro-democratic members of the Consultative Committee. The proposals carried considerable weight as shown by its shadowy appearance in the 1987 Green Paper on Constitutional Reform. It also appeared in the first draft of the Basic Law as one of several proposals. After the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, the Group of 89 softened its stance slightly with respect to direct elections and reopened negotiations with the pro-democracy camp which led to the outcome of the \\"compromise model\\". However the compromise model divided the group between the one who favoured compromise and the ones who favoured the pro-Beijing model put forward by the New Hong Kong Alliance, a political group led by Lo Tak-shing emerged from the more conservative wing of the group. Vincent Lo, leader of the Business and Professional Group, bitterly opposed a democratic government before and after 1997, feared grassroots participation and fulminated endlessly about the dangers of direct elections. They argued that it would be naive to think that democracy would enable them to resist Beijing: no political system could stop Beijing if it wanted to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs. Only by maintaining the territory's prosperity and its economic value to China, they insisted, could Hong Kong prevent interference from the mainland. The core members of the business and professional group formed the Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong. Many of the members also founded the Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong on the eve of the first ever direct elections to the Legislative Council in 1991.

He was the grandson of Tardu (575‚Äì603) through his son Tulu (ÈÉΩÂÖ≠). Background  Western Turkic Empire in present-day Turkestan was founded as the result of the partition of the main empire after the death of Tardu in 603. It was also called On Ok (\\"Ten arrows\\") referring to ten powerful tribes in the empire. Five tribes (called Dulo) to the northeast and five tribes to the southwest (called Nushibi) formed the two rival factions, the border line being Ili River. After Partitioning Sheguy was Tardu's grandson and governor of Chach (Tashkent)Baumer, same page, has him conquer Tashkent. Perhaps he conquered and became governor(?). Baumer also has him raid near Isfahan in 616-17 and 'incorporate the whole of the Altai'. He was expected to be enthroned after the death of Tardu. But the Dulu faction enthroned Taman (also called Heshana Khan) who was a generation younger than Sheguy. But Taman was a very inexperienced ruler and was a puppet of Dulu clan. Nushibi clan as well as Silk road merchants who suffered from the increasing anarchy supported Sheguy to throne in 611. When Taman partisans arrested a Chinese ambassador to Sheguy, Sheguy revolted and Taman had to flee to Sui China where he was killed.L.N.Gumilev: Eski T√ºrkler (tr: Ahsen Batur), ƒ∞stanbul, 2002, Selenge Yayƒ±nlarƒ±. . , p.199-200.

Although very resistant to interference, metal, water and obstacles, it is very limited in range, usually only suitable for short-range networks under 70 feet. The baud rate is limited to 1,200 kB/s, making it a very low-rate communication network as well. This standard is aimed at the conception of wireless network of sensors and actuators in industrial and military environments. One of the major advantage 1902.1 tags is they are extremely low power and last for years (5-10) on a simple coin size battery and they can be sealed in a MIL STD 810G package. RuBee tags emit virtually no RF and do not produce any Compromising Emanations, as a result are used in high security facilities. RuBee tags are safe and in use near and on high explosive facilities. The IEEE 1902.1 is an alternative to other higher-power wireless network of sensors and actuators based on the standard IEEE 802.15.4, such as ZigBee and 6LoWPAN. Other concurrent standards also exist: ISO/IEC 18000-7 DASH7, infrared networking and ultra-wide band networking. IEEE 1902.1 is unique as it uses a very low frequency and magnetic field modulation (created by a magnetic dipole antenna in the near-field) as the physical mean. The IEEE Working Group on 1902.1 named itself RuBee, after the gem and insect. RuBee stands in contrast to the well-known network certification ZigBee, a related but completely different networking standard.  Network devices  IEEE 1902.1 supports the design of networks constituted by two devices: Controllers and Responders, based on a simplified IEEE MAC data layer. The Controller initiates a command request and the Responder detects the request, processes some functions like measuring pressure, temperature or activating a relay, before sending a Response packet back to the Controller. Responder devices have four addresses, two of them configurable, and two by fabric design.  Network Power  The maximum power of emission recommended is 10 micro-Watts. This power limits the area of the network to a piconet, between and .  Physical layer  The physical communication mean used is the inductive coupling signaling working in the near field of a 131 kHz magnetic dipole antenna. Inductive coupling power falls cubically with the distance between the Controller and Responder.  Modulation  The recommended modulations are Amplitude-shift keying (ASK), and Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK). The Controller must support both modulations, although the Responder may only support one.  Encoding  On top of the modulation, the IEEE 1902.1 recommends two encoding methods: BMC, Bi-phase Marc Coding, known as a Manchester Encoding technique. This encoding method combined with BPSK is insensitive to a polarity reversal and has a good signal-to-noise ratio.  Data Protocol  IEEE 1902.1 - Protocol States Diagram - free interpretation of the author, not IEEE The protocol is simple: the Controller originates the signal and sends out a PDU (Protocol Data Unit) to a Responder along with its address and the command to be processed. The Responder sends a PDU back to the Controller in response. Two types of PDUs are available for use in the protocol: the Request PDU and the Respond PDU. Each support an application protocol that the specific implementation must define. A frame check sequence is responsible for error checking, which, due to the system's simplicity, must be done on the application layer. The protocol uses heuristics - measures that generally work but do not absolutely guarantee their reception or accuracy - in order to be most efficient. Unlike the Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) standard there is no anti-collision mechanism; multiple signals are unable to be distinguished by the network if the Controllers and Responders are not completely synchronized.  Responder States  The Controller is considered permanently \\"Awake\\" and to have a power supply provided by a permanent source. The Responder is made to work on battery and alternate between \\"Listening\\" and \\"Sleeping\\" states. The Responder, in the \\"Listen\\" state, tries to detect a carrier at 131 kHz and to read its commands. An emitting Controller in ASK sends a low power carrier for a zero bit whereas in BPSK the carrier is always present at the maximum emitting power. Thus, the Responder can detect the communicating Controller and stay listening. If there are many Responders and if the Controller uses only the one-to-one Request PDU, the Responder will stay listening for all commands sent and received on the network, and therefore may stay permanently awake. The use of responder groups, multicast or broadcast, help to better manage battery life for the Responders. An optimization for the cost and sleeping period of the Request PDUs must be done on the application layer.  Carrier Power  A nice feature proposed in the standard is a frequency available to broadcast energy and supply the Responders. This frequency is 65.536 kHz, about half of the 131 kHz frequency that is used for data communication. The IEEE 1902.1 recommends devices to have an average power of less than 10 milli-Watts (mW). As the medium in an inductive signal, the signal diminishes cubically, so the Responders must sleep quite a long time in order to store enough energy to listen and respond to the Controller requests. It is often desirable for them to charge for periods of time before being used again. Use of a higher wattage is not allowed in Europe.  Anti-collision mechanisms  BMC encoding on BPSK modulation allows synchronizing the listening of the carrier on a specific Responder or Controller signal, rejecting all other signals as noise. The listener device can also have two listening channels with synchronized sampling at 90¬∞ (phase quadrature) and help to distinguish even signals with orthogonal interference.  Volume multiplexing and Clip Mechanism  If a network is composed of many Controllers and a large number of Responders, the Controllers' requests are synchronized as well as Responders' responses (the \\"Clip\\" mechanism). In the traditional \\"volume multiplexing\\" concept, however, the Controllers would be placed nearby their Responders and answer only to the nearest Controller. This \\"Clip\\" Controller signal is much better that others at greater distances and filters out more noise.  Where to use the IEEE 1902.1 standard  * This is the lowest power, frequency and rate wireless area network available for industrial use. The use of an inductive signal enables the creation of a small piconet for sensors and actuators that become completely insensitive to metal, water and surrounding obstacles, unlike the well known IEEE 802.15.4, on which other standards are based (for example, LRWPAN, the Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Network, like ZigBee, uses the 2.4 GHz frequency that is very sensitive to multipath, radio reflection, obstacles, water, and metals). The baud rate of IEEE 1902.1 is, however, 250 times less than that of IEEE 802.15.4. * The simplicity of the modulation is due to the lack of components that implement this standard. All must be done with discrete components. * The distinguishing factor of the IEEE 1902.1 standard: > ¬´RuBee is the only wireless technology to ever be approved for use in secure > facilities by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE). RuBee has also been > approved by DoE and HERO tests by the Department of Defense for use in high > explosive areas with a Safe Separation Distance (SSD) and intrinsic safety > of zero¬ª. Explanation: RuBee uses very low frequency modulation and is not so absorbed by matter than more used standards of IEEE 802 like WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth. So, RuBee heats less matter. For explosive manufacturing and storage, it should be safer if the comparison uses identical emitting power between compared solutions. * RuBee \\"Tags\\" may be detected with high sensitivity through doors, even if the asset is hidden in a steel briefcase, as well as in vehicles through gates using antennas buried in a road. * Highly sensitive assets can be secured by Rubee's Tags with the particular advantage that obstacles, conductive barriers, or walls will not create false alarms or diminish the range of detection of the Tag.

He attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where received legal training, and inherited lands and properties in and around Beverley, Yorkshire, where he lived and served in the local militia. He kept diaries from 1759 to his death. Life and career Courtney was born in Beverley. His father, also John (1679‚Äì1756), the son of a London stonemason, worked for the East India Company and became Governor of Surat. His mother was Elizabeth Bourdenand (n√©e Featherstone), daughter of Thomas Featherstone of Beverley. His parents were married in 1732. Courtney studied at Beverley Grammar School under the Revd John Clarke, who moved to Wakefield School in 1751, taking Courtney with him. The next year, Courtney was admitted as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received legal training. His grandmother and other relatives left him land and rental property in Beverley and the surrounding area, and he returned there to live the life of a country gentleman. Courtney married Mary Smelt (born circa 1744‚Äì1805), daughter of William Smelt and Ursula (n√©e Hankin). Mary was the sister-in-law of the botanist Sir Sir Thomas Frankland, 6th Baronet and Cornelius Smelt, a Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man. Courtney and Mary had three daughters and at least five sons: John (1769‚Äì1845) who became a priest, Ralph (b.1770 and died the same year), Cornelius (1773‚Äì1793), Henry (1774‚Äì1844), Thomas (1776‚Äì1818) and Septimus (1779‚Äì1843), Mary (1777‚Äì1787), Margaret Jesse (b. 1780) and Dorothy Anne (b. 1781).\\"Papers of the Courtney Family of Beverley\\" , Hull University, Brynmor Jones Library, accessed November 27, 2013 Diaries Courtney began keeping diaries by 1759, which contain information about Beverley politics, buildings, sporting events, restaurants and other public accommodations and attractions.

The play is a light hearted comedy. It is best known for Vijay Chavan's iconic role in this famous Marathi Stage drama where he regaled in the title role of Moru's aunt. Synopsis Set in the post-Independence era when different sansthans (princely states) of India were being demolished, the play deals with three college friends Moru (Prashant Damle), Bhaiyya (Pradeep Patwardhan) and Bandya (Vijay Chavan). Moru and Bhaiyya are sharing a bungalow they have rented. Moru's aunt, the queen of Kanda Sansthan, is coming visiting. So Moru and Bhaiyya call their girlfriends from their neighborhood to give her company but at the last minute the aunt's visit is cancelled and Bandya, who is playing a female part for a theatre group is coaxed by his two friends to become Moru's aunt. What follows is a fun-filled drama with Bhaiyya's uncle and the girls' uncle proposing to mavshi and the arrival of the real mavshi and her niece who happens to be Bandya's girlfriend. Style Singing and dancing are used here to good effect laced with comedy.

Introduction of CASTp Server  Computer Atlas of Surface Topography of Proteins (CASTp) aims to provide comprehensive and detailed quantitative characterization of topographic features of protein, is now updated to version 3.0. Since its release in 2006, the CASTp server has ‚àº 45 000 visits and fulfills ‚àº 33 000 calculation requests annually. CASTp has been proven as a confident tool for a wide range of researches, including investigations of signaling receptors, discoveries of cancer therapeutics, understanding of mechanism of drug actions, studies of immune disorder diseases, analysis of protein‚Äìnanoparticle interactions, inference of protein functions and development of high-throughput computational tools. This server is maintained by Jie Liang's lab in University of Illinois at Chicago.  2. Geometric Modeling Principles  For the calculation strategy of CASTp, alpha-shape and discrete-flow methods are applied to the protein binding site, also the measurement of pocket size by the program of CAST by Liang et al in 1998, then updated by Tian et al in 2018. Firstly, CAST identifies atoms which form the protein pocket, then calculates the volume and area, identifies the atoms forming the rims of pocket mouth, computes how many mouth openings for each pocket, predict the area and circumference of mouth openings, finally locates cavities and calculate their size. The secondary structures were calculated by DSSP. The single amino acid annotations were fetched from UniProt database, then mapped to PDB structures following residue-level information from SIFTS database.  3. Instructions of Protein Pocket Calculation  3.1 Input Protein structures in PDB format, and a probe radius. 3.2 Searching Users can either search for pre-computed result by 4-letter PDB ID, or upload their own PDB file for customized computation. The core algorithm helps in finding the pocket or cavity with capability of housing a solvent, with a default or adjusted diameter. 3.3 Output CASTp identifies all surface pockets, interior cavities and cross channels, provides detailed delineation of all atoms participating in their formation, including the area and volume of pocket or void as well as measurement of numbers of mouth opening of a particular pocket ID by solvent accessible surface model (Richards' surface) and by molecular surface model (Connolly surface), all calculated analytically. The core algorithm helps in finding the pocket or cavity with capability of housing a solvent with a diameter of 1.4 √Ö. This online tool also supports PyMOL and UCSF Chimera plugin for molecular visualization.  4. Why CASTp is Useful?  4.1 Protein science, from an amino acid to sequences and structures Proteins are large, complex molecules that playing critical roles to maintain the normal functioning of the human body. They are essential not just for the structure and function, but also the regulation among the body‚Äôs tissues and organs. Proteins are made up of hundreds of smaller units called amino acids that are attached to one another by peptide bonds, forming a long chain. 4.2 Protein active sites Usually, the active site of a protein locates on its center of action and, the key to its function. The first step is the detection of active sites on the protein surface and an exact description of their features and boundaries. These specifications are vital inputs for subsequent target druggability prediction or target comparison. Most of the algorithms for active site detection are based on geometric modeling or energetic features based calculation. 4.3 The role of protein pockets The shape and properties of the protein surface determine what interactions are possible with ligands and other macromolecules. Pockets are an important yet ambiguous feature of this surface. During drug discovery process, the first step in screening for lead compounds and potential molecules as drugs is usually a selection of the shape of the binding pocket. Shape plays a role in many computational pharmacological methods. Based on existing results, most features important to predicting drug-binding were depended on size and shape of the binding pocket, with the chemical properties of secondary importance. The surface shape is also important for interactions between protein and water. However, defining discrete pockets or possible interaction sites still remains unclear, due to the shape and location of nearby pockets affected promiscuity and diversity of binding sites. Since most pockets are open to solvent, to define the border of a pocket is the primary difficulty. Those closed to solvent we refer to as buried cavities. With the benefit of well- defined extent, area and volume, buried cavities are more straightforward to locate. In contrast, the border of an open pocket defines its mouth and it provides the cut-off for determination of the surface area and volume. Even defining the pocket as a set of residues does not define the volume or the mouth of the pocket. 4.4 Druggability role prediction In pharmaceutical industry, the current priority strategy for target assessment is high- throughput screening (HTS). NMR screenings are applied against large compound datasets. Chemical characteristics of compounds binding against specific targets are measured, so how well the compound sets bind to the chemical space will decide the binding efficiency. Success rates of virtually docking of the drug-like ligands into the active sites of the target proteins would be detected for prioritization, while the most of the active sites located at the pockets. With the benefits of large amount of structural data, computational methods from different perspectives for druggability prediction have been introduced during the last 30 years with positive results, as a vital instrument to accelerate the prediction accessibility. Many candidates have been integrated into drug discovery pipeline already since then. 5. New Features in CASTp 3.0 5.1 Pre-computed results for biological assemblies For a lot of proteins deposited in Protein Data Bank, the asymmetric unit might be different from biological unit, which would make the computational result biologically irrelevant. So the new CASTp 3.0 computed the topological features for biological assemblies, overcome the barriers between asymmetric unit and biological assemblies. 5.2 Imprints of negative volumes of topological features In the 1st release of CASTp server in 2006, only geometric and topological features of those surface atoms participated in the formation of protein pockets, cavities, and channels. The new CASTp added the ‚Äúnegative volume‚Äù of the space, referred to the space encompassed by the atoms formed these geometric and topological features. 5.3 Comprehensive annotation on single amino-acid polymorphism The latest CASTp integrated protein annotations aligned with the sequence, including the brief feature, positions, description, and reference of the domains, motifs, and single amino-acid polymorphisms. 5.4 Improved user interface & convenient visualization The new CASTp now incorporated 3Dmol.js for structural visualization, made users able to browse, to interact the protein 3D model, and to examine the computational results in latest web-browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, et al. Users can pick their own representation style of the atoms which form each topographic feature, and to edit the colors by their own preferences.

Engine The engine is essentially the four-cylinder engine of the preceding 25 hp car which chief engineer C E King had modified adding an overhead valve head and, because such largish engines now usually had six-cylinders for smoothness, the harmonic balancer invented by Dr F W Lanchester at the centre of its crankshaft. The dynamo is driven from the clutch casing so it is generating while the engine is running. The nearside of the engine carries the generator and magneto, the carburettor and its water-heated induction pipe with a proper hot-spot and the vacuum tank on the dash. The offside of the engine has the starter, steering- box, exhaust manifold, oil-dipper gauge and oil filler. The water connection between the lower casting and the cylinder head is through large external aluminium ports so there is a single compression joint between castings. =Lanchester harmonic balancer= The Lanchester harmonic balancer on the crankshaft has two weighted drums driven at twice crankshaft speed, one by a helical gear wheel attached to the crankshaft and the other by the primary drum. In a four-cylinder engine unbalanced secondary forces occur twice in each crankshaft revolution. The harmonic balancer counteracts any tendency to undesirable vibration. Few surviving cars retain the balancer. Transmission There is a right hand gear-change lever The clutch's thrust and withdrawal races are oiled by hand and it is necessary to unscrew the alloy front floorboards for access but the gearbox has a quickly detachable filler. The multiplate clutch is run with graphite and coupled by a fabric joint to the 4-speed gearbox then to the spiral-bevel driven rear axle located by torque girders Chassis Front-wheel brakes for the 23-60 \\"Four-wheel braking with independent rear-wheel braking on a different set of drums.\\" \\"The compensating or balancing mechanism of the Vauxhall front brakes is easily understood. A is the pedal brake-rod, which through the pin B turns or twists the cross-piece C, to which at opposite ends are attached the cables that work the brake shoes. The pin B, as it is free to incline slightly, finds the true centre immediately there is the slightest resistance, and thus the shoes on each side come into action simultaneously and with equal power.\\" The chassis with its mechanicals was guaranteed for three years. =Brakes= The foot brake operates on the transmission and the lever brakes on the rear wheels. Both sets are of the internal expanding type. The adjustment for wear of the foot brake may be made by hand but adjustment of the rear brakes requires a spanner. 23-60 tourer briefly at rest first registered 25 May 1923 Twelve months later front brakes were made available on new cars for a further ¬£55. A year later again they were standardised on the 23-60 in July 1924 along with a redesigned front axle, springs and saddle-plate. Operated by the foot pedal the front brakes and the transmission brake were linked, the latter being given a slight lead. The brakes on the rear wheels were independently controlled by the handbrake lever. For more information on Vauxhall brakes performance see 30-98 =Steering= Steering was by worm and wheel. =Suspension= By half- elliptical springs in front and behind.

The company was founded in Tampere, Finland in 2009. Its publisher is Paradox Interactive. Paradox tests, markets, sells and distributes all games by Colossal Order. The CEO of Colossal Order is Mariina Hallikainen. History Colossal Order was founded in the summer of 2009 by a group of game developers of the mobile game company Universomo. Mariina Hallikainen was hired from outside of Universomo as the CEO of the new company. At first, Colossal Order had difficulties obtaining funding for its first game, the business simulation game Cities in Motion, that was already in development when the company was founded. Investors thought that Cities in Motion would not attract a large enough clientele. Instead of big investors, the first steps of the company were funded by Finnish public instruments ‚Äì Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment, Tekes, and DigiDemo finance of the Promotion Centre for Audiovisual Culture ‚Äì as well as small private investors. In its early phase, the company was coached by the Yritystalli program of the Tampere University of Technology, but advice was sought directly from experienced Finnish game development companies as well, specifically Remedy Entertainment and Frozenbyte. Upon being founded, Colossal Order compared dozens of publishers and ended up signing a publishing agreement with Paradox Interactive after over a year's worth of negotiations. In October 2015, Colossal Order was awarded the Finnish Game Developer of the Year () award at the convention. The judges thanked Colossal Order for focusing: \\"from its inception ... on ‚Äì in addition to developing games ‚Äì also developing its business model\\". Games The relationship between Colossal Order and its publisher Paradox Interactive has been characterized as constructive. Colossal Order has the freedom to create games without limitations set by the publisher, bar those on schedules. Unlike the game developers that founded it, Colossal Order does not develop mobile games. Instead, the company focuses on PC games. Employees of the company have their own internal wiki platform for developing games. Games by Colossal Order are known for their active modding communities. One of the programmers at the company works full-time on modding tools. The best-known game of the company is the city-building game Cities: Skylines published in March 2015. It competes with games of the SimCity and Cities XL series. Cities: Skylines got its first expansion pack, Cities: Skylines ‚Äì After Dark, in September 2015. Its second expansion pack came out in February 2016, called Cities Skylines - Snowfall. A third expansion pack, Cities: Skylines - Natural Disasters, was released in November 2016, the fourth expansion pack, Mass Transit, in May 2017. The fifth expansion, Green Cities, came out in October 2017, and the sixth expansion, Parklife was released in May 2018. The seventh expansion, Industries, was released in October 2018, and the eighth expansion, Campus, was released in May 2019. The ninth and most recent expansion, Sunset Harbor, was released in March 2020.

It is a community based festival that takes place annually. It is run by the Leith Festival Association. It had been previously run by Leith Festival Club. The Edinburgh Short Film Festival, LeithLate and Leith Jazz and Blues Festival also run along the same time as the Leith Festival. Background The current version of the Leith Festival started in the late 1980s. It takes place in June each year and includes Leith Festival Gala Day which started in 1907 as the Leith Gala. The Scotsman has reported that a precursor to the current day festival was established 100 years before the 2007 event. Leith Gala and Leith Pageant were started in order to raise money to pay for treatment at Leith Hospital before the days on the National Health Service. It continues with the role of fund raising with the parade and Gala day events, fun fair and stalls on Leith Links. There have been a number of festivals of various kinds held in Leith from The Edinburgh International Festival to the 1951 Festival of Britain and other local festivals. In the late 1960s an Art festival was set up as a community Festival. Over time the Gala expanded to become a community arts event being run continuously in its present form since the late eighties. It is supported by local businesses and funding (when available), and continues to be a much-anticipated annual event.

Academician of the Real Academia Espa√±ola since 1990, he was the recipient of the Order of Arts and Letters of Spain, the Men√©ndez Pelayo International Prize (2010) and the Spanish Literature National Prize (2011). \\"El Nacional de las Letras premia el compromiso de Sampedro.

He became an inspiration for the anti-austerity movement in Spain. Biography In 1917, the year of his birth, his family moved to Tangier (Morocco), where he lived until aged thirteen. In 1936 he was mobilized by the Republican faction in the Spanish Civil War, fighting in an anarchist battalion. He spent the war serving variously in Catalonia, Guadalajara, Castilla-La Mancha and Huete (Cuenca). After the war, he was again called up and served in the garrison of the Spanish enclave of Melilla in North Africa After the war he obtained work as a customs officer in Santander before moving to Madrid, where, in 1944 he married Elizabeth Pellicer before completing his university studies in Economics in 1947, winning, in the process, the award of an ‚ÄúExtraordinary Prize‚Äù. Thereafter he started working with a major Spanish financial institution at that moment, the Banco Exterior de Espa√±a whilst also teaching at the university. In 1955 he became the professor of Economic policy at the Complutense University of Madrid, which post he held until 1969, combining teaching with various positions in the Banco Exterior de Espa√±a, where he reached the post of deputy general manager. Meanwhile, he published academic works about the post economic reality and structural analysis and the European future of Spain and also wrote his first theatrical play A place to live (1955). Around 1965 and 1966 there was a purge of prominent university professors in Spain including the philosopher :es:Jos√© Luis L√≥pez Aranguren and socialist lawyer Enrique Tierno Galv√°n, as a result of which he decided to become a visiting professor at the Universities of Salford and Liverpool in North West England. Along with other teachers, Sampedro created the Spanish Center for Studies and Research (CEISA), a symbol of intellectual independence which would be closed in Francoist Spain three years later. In 1968 he was appointed as Anna Howard Shaw lecturer at Bryn Mawr College for women in Philadelphia USA On his return to Spain he requested a leave of absence from Complutense University and published a satirical play called the naked horse. After the death of Francisco Franco In 1976 he returned to the Banco Exterior de Espa√±a as a consultant economist. In 1977 he was appointed senator by Royal prerogative of King Juan Carlos, then, following the first democratic Spanish general election, 1977 he was elected as a socialist senator a post he held until 1979. In parallel to his professional activity as an economist, he published several novels and continued to write after his official retirement, achieving great successes with works like October, October, Etruscan smile or Old siren. Sadly, his literary successes coincided with the tragic news of the death of his wife, Isabel Pellicer, in 1986. In 1990 he was appointed member of the Royal Spanish Academy, the definitive authority on the Castilian Spanish where his heterodox inaugural address, From the border \\"Desde la frontera\\" Discurso de ingreso 1991. related to the subject of his novel The old siren, published that same year, which can be considered a Spanish hymn to life, love and tolerance. In 2003 the widowed Sampedro was remarried to the writer, poet and translator :es:Olga Lucas in the spa town of Alhama de Arag√≥n. Thereafter he spent part of the year on Tenerife, in the Canary Islands a place of myths whose symbols, the Dracaena draco tree, is supposedly home to the Tenerife blue chaffinch of the volcanic peak of Mount Teide which inspired him to write The path of the dragon tree. He exercised his critical humanism about what he viewed as the moral and social disruption arising from Western style Neoliberalism and Capitalism. In reference to this, he added his grain of sand to the Anti-austerity movement in Spain during May 2011 by writing the preface to the Spanish edition of the book Time for Outrage by the French diplomat St√©phane Hessel. Sampedro died on April 8, 2013, in Madrid, aged 96 years old. Awards In 2002 Sampedro was appointed honorary non- executive chairman of the Spanish telecommunications company Sintratel, along with Nobel prizewinner Jos√© Saramago. Sintratel is a skit on sin trabajo telecoms or telecommunications workers without work Historial sobre \\"El efecto Iguaz√∫\\", (in Spanish, approximately: ‚Äò‚ÄôThe cascade effect‚Äô‚Äô) by Manuel J.

In 2010 was awarded the XXIV Men√©ndez Pelayo International Prize for his \\"many contributions to human thought\\" as, variously, an economist, writer and teacher.

Early life Connolly attended Full Sail University's film program, where he met many of his future collaborators. After graduating from his course, Connolly worked in construction and 2 other side jobs so he could get enough money to buy some gear. Connolly after around a year was employed to produce advertisements and product videos for companies including Dell and Alienware. He also founded Triune Films, a production company under which he became involved with multiple film projects. Film Riot Connolly was first noticed by Revision3 when he began making Making the Film, a YouTube show documenting the process of producing a movie. They approached him, and pitched the idea of a higher-budget version of the same premise. Connolly signed up to their team, and began producing Film Riot. The first episode was released on May 27, 2009, and made available on both the Revision3 website and the Film Riot YouTube channel. In the years of Film Riot, Connolly began uploading episodes to a YouTube channel he created. The first episode was made available on July 5, 2011. As of July 2020, the Film Riot YouTube channel has over 1.6 million subscribers. Other channels * \\"Film State,\\" a cancelled show for movie news. * Pimp Your Production, an internet series created/ produced by Eric Kessler, was also hosted by Connolly. Similar to Film Riot, the program focused on more professional filming techniques, and therefore utilised more expensive equipment and techniques. The show followed a much more sporadic release schedule, with a total of 8 episodes from its launch in April 2011 to its discontinuation.

History The company started as a printing business established by a certain William Paul in Kirby Street, Hatton Garden in 1839. In 1843 it was sold to George Watson, then working as a jobbing printer and stationer at Tring in Herts. He bought a new Hopkinson & Cope press, modernised the plant by introducing steam power and considerably expanding the enterprise, initially printing the temperance magazine \\"Band of Hope Review\\". His printing contracts soon included the monthly \\"The British Workman and Friends of the Sons of Toil\\". To these were added \\"Eclectic and Congregational Review\\", \\"Alexandra Magazine\\", \\"Woman's Social and Industrial Advocate\\" and \\"Family Mirror\\". Walter Hazell (1843-1919) joined the firm in 1863 and it became known as Watson and Hazell. Hazell launched the \\"Illustrated Photographer\\" and \\"Amateur Photographer\\", and also printed the \\"Marylebone Mercury\\", the \\"East London Observer\\" and the \\"Bucks Independent\\". In 1867 the firm opened a branch in Aylesbury and in 1873 another branch in the Strand, London. When John Elliott Viney joined the firm as a partner in 1875, it became Hazell, Watson and Viney. A merger with Ford and Tilt of Long Acre Street, London in 1884, saw the firm change its name again, this time to Hazell, Watson and Viney, Ltd, valued at ¬£138,000. The 1890s saw the printing of some sixty newspapers and periodicals at Kirby Street. The legal and commercial printing division was located in Long Acre Street while books were mainly produced at Aylesbury. In 1869 the head office was moved from Kirby Street to Charles Street, in 1889 to Creed Street, Ludgate Hill, and finally in 1901 to Long Acre Street. The Kirby Street works were closed in 1920 and moved to Aylesbury and Long Acre Street. In 1878 the Aylesbury branch was moved to Tring Road in Aylesbury, undergoing periodic expansion from 1885 onwards. By 1939 the firm's employees numbered 1700. Walter Hazell, born 1 January 1843, was the only surviving son of Jonathan Hazell. As chairman he played an active part in the company's affairs for some fifty years, and was a social reformer and Women's Suffrage supporter who wrote a number of pamphlets on social issues. He was also the Liberal Member of Parliament for Leicester between 1894 and 1900, and was instrumental in introducing an employees' sick fund in 1874, one of many such welfare schemes that marked the firm as progressive. The Buckinghamshire County Museum has a portrait of his son. Walter Howard Hazell (1870‚Äì1929), of Hazell, Watson and Viney Ltd \\"Hazell's Magazine\\", which appeared from 1886, was one of the company's first in-house publications. Several generations of the Viney family played a major part in the running of the company. Hazell's grew after World War II as part of the Hazell Sun group of companies, and in 1963 became the British Printing Corporation, one of the most influential printing and publishing organisations in Britain.

Yeomsaek primarily uses natural colourings such as tea, saffron and gardenia. The most important of these from a cultural perspective is indigo (jjock), which was used for the Korean Royal Family and for weddings. The indigo dyeing process is centred in the Naju area, where regular flooding of the Yeongsan River provides an ideal wetland environment for the indigo plant. The plants are harvested in July, before they flower, and the leaves are stored in earthenware jars of water for several days to extract the pigment. The leaves are then removed and the water is mixed with lime from powdered oyster or clam shells to create a base. The leaves are dried and burned, and the ash is used as a source of lye which is mixed with the base. Finally, the mixture is stirred and fermented for several days to produce the eventual dye. Fabric to by dyed is soaked in the resulting liquid (which stains it yellow) and then dried in sunlight, which activates the pigments and turns the cloth a deep blue. The current master of this process, designated a Living National Treasure, is Jung Gwan-chae, who has cultivated indigo plants and prepared dye for over three decades. He became interested in the process at university, when one of his teachers gave him an indigo seed as a gift. Experimentation led to his rediscovery of traditional jjock-yeomsaek processes, and he has since become the major exponent of the art in Korea.

Organization of the debate  This debate was one of interactive thematic public debates convened on 10 April 2013 by the President of the General Assembly during the resumed part of the UNGA's 67th session. It was scheduled after Gotovina and Markaƒç were acquitted of the war crimes by the ICTY in November 2012. Jeremiƒá stated that there was a strong pressure to cancel the debate and concluded that the boycott was not successful.  Participants  Theodor Meron announced that all three Hague war-crimes courts turned down the invitation of the UNGA president for participation in the debate about their work. The president of the General Assembly described the refusal of the ICTY president to participate in this debate as scandalous. The debate had two sessions, first participated by the representatives of countries and second by NGOs and notable experts. Experts who participated in the debate included Lewis Mackenzie, Savo ≈†trbac, Matthew Parish, John Laughland, William Schabas, Charles Jalloh and John Ciorciari.Comments of Matthew Parish on the panel debate, Transconflict, 2 May 2012 The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon was one of the participants in the debate. More than 80 countries participated in the debate which was the highest number in the history of UN public debates. The delegation of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina was led by Neboj≈°a Radmanoviƒá. The president of Croatia Ivo Josipoviƒá had emphasized that he would not attend nor participate in the debate.  Debate  The debate was opened by Vuk Jeremiƒá who underlined that in the UN no topic should be forbidden. The first participant in the debate was Tomislav Nikoliƒá, the president of Serbia. He criticized the work of ICTY emphasizing that it did not contribute but hindered the reconciliation in former Yugoslavia. He reminded that, although there is no significant ethnic disproportion among the number of casualties in the Yugoslav wars, the ICTY sentenced Serbs to 1,150 years in prison while members of other ethnic groups are sentenced to 55 totally for crimes against Serbs. Vitaly Churkin, the ambassador of Russia to the UN, also criticized the work of the ICTY, especially acquittals of Gotovina and Ramush Haradinaj. He emphasized that in this cases the justice has not been satisfied because in this cases nobody was convicted for evident crimes. An incident happened during the speech of Tomislav Nikoliƒá when Munira Suba≈°iƒá, president of \\"Mothers of Srebrenica\\" organization, was dismissed from the hall after she revealed a shirt with an inscription against the Republic of Srpska.  Reactions  Judge Theodor Meron of the ICTY at the time of this debate, criticized this debate and argued that \\"Acquittals, just as convictions, show the health of the system.\\" Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch stated that debate is a revisionist denial of the war crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars. United States, Canada and Jordan boycotted the debate while the critics of the debate asserted that it was an attempt to discredit the ICTY. The president of the UNGA Vuk Jeremiƒá replied that he does not shy away from criticizing the ICTY which has \\"convicted nobody for inciting crimes committed against Serbs in Croatia.\\" References Category:United Nations General Assembly ","title":"Thematic debate on the role of international criminal justice in reconciliation"},{"id":"39059895","text":"Eupithecia junctifascia is a moth in the family Geometridae.

Often, payroll automation is integrated into the company's enterprise resource planning system that provides an overall view of the company's or community's finances; in addition to payroll, it can manage customer relationships, production, personnel resources, invoicing and accounting.  Payroll activities  Payroll management consists of several stages and procedures that require expertise in financial administration, such as employment contract management. Payroll management performs the following tasks: * Calculating and paying wages, settlement of tax withholdings * Delivery of wage calculations and certificates to the employees * Compiling statistics for different authorities, and for the purposes of improving activities * Drawing up employment contracts * Providing regulatory reports to the tax agencies and insurance companies * Calculating annual holidays * Managing deductions for employee benefits The travel costs and travel invoices from the employees are usually processed together with payroll.  Methods  Payroll functions can be automated using software to facilitate the collection, organization and storage of all information required for payroll calculations and regulatory agency reportage requirements. If the payroll software is not purchased as part of a comprehensive business management system, it can usually be combined with the company's existing solutions for accounting, sales ledger, working hour management and recruiting. Information that has been captured in one part of the system can be used by other modules. Hours registered in the work management system, for example, are automatically transferred to the wage calculation system.  Benefits  Effective payroll automation collects all relevant information in one place in electronic format, reducing mistakes by eliminating the need to synchronize and manage otherwise duplicate data sets. The American Payroll Association (APA) estimates that automation reduces costs related to payroll management by up to 80%, which is partially explained by the reduced mistakes in wage payments and invoicing. Well planned, modern payroll software provides the following benefits: * It considers collective labor agreements and employer-specific procedures and exceptions. * It provides a breakdown of the allowances and other bases for wages in the report, with dedicated rows for each day, week and month. * It automatically follows the legislated accounting and calculation rules in the calculation of annual holidays. * It manages the drawing up, posting, archiving and reporting of travel invoices. * When combined with work shift management software, it can utilize data concerning working hours, overtime, allowances, holidays and absences.

He played a major role in the development of the style known as European Art Deco. Life and work Ren√© Lacaze was born in Paris on 27 July 1901. His mother ran a tailoring and dressmaking business in Rue d‚ÄôAlger, where Lacaze grew to love fashion from his early childhood. His uncle, Armand Bignon, often took the young Lacaze to visit museums, where he discovered a passion for art. A friend of Lacaze was a jeweller and regaled Lacaze with accounts of his work, describing how he created pieces of jewellery set with precious stones including diamonds. Lacaze felt drawn to the profession. He began a four-year training course at Atelier Mentel in Paris, a studio which worked with the most famous jewellers of the time: Cartier, Boucheron, Ancoc and Jan√©sich. However, he was forced to interrupt this training in 1921 to complete his military service. After spending 26 months in the Air Force near Bourges, where he was deployed as a cartographer, he returned to Paris and introduced himself to the great jewellers in the Rue de la Paix and Place Vend√¥me. In 1923 Lacaze began to work for Van Cleef & Arpels,Van Cleef & Arpels where it was not long before his exceptional talent for drawing was spotted. Together with Alfred van Cleef's daughter, Ren√©e Rachel Puissant, he took over as head of artistic and creative design at Van Cleef & Arpels in 1926. This period saw the creation of famous pieces of jewellery such as the Minaudi√®re and the introduction of the 'serti invisible' technique which enabled gemstones to be held in place without visible prongs or claws. In June 1928 Lacaze married his wife Simone; the couple went on to have four children. As he explains in his unpublished biography, in that year Lacaze added the first syllable of his wife's name to his own and henceforth was known as Ren√© Sim Lacaze. Lacaze ceased to work for Van Cleef & Arpels in 1941, moving to Mauboussin and also running his own jewellery studio. He created pieces for illustrious clients including Marlene Dietrich, Mich√®le Morgan, Maurice Chevalier and the Duchess of Windsor. Upon his retirement in 1968, Lacaze devoted himself to painting and produced numerous water-colours. He died at the age of 99 in Maisons-Laffitte on 5 January 2000. Today, the name of Ren√© Sim Lacaze stands for the luxury online jewellery store Ren√©Sim,Ren√©Sim founded in 2010 by Lacaze's grandson Maximilian Hemmerle and Hemmerle's business partner Georg Schmidt-Sailer.

Her parents separated during her childhood. After her mother abandoned their home, Milfe had to care for her father who then left her and young siblings to their grandmother when he went to the capital, Manila.

She detailed that he strikes her head with a cooking ladle and he'll only stop if he sees blood on her forehead and face. Afterwards he'll cry and say, \\"It's your fault.\\" Those kind of incidents are the reasons she harbored negative feelings against her father during that time.

In 1693 Sheikh Yusuf from Makassar was exiled to the Cape of Good Hope, because he assisted Banten Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa's rebellion against the Dutch. At that time, the Dutch colonized both the Cape of Good Hope (now the city of Cape Town) and the Dutch East Indies (centered in Batavia). Yusuf's arrival in Cape Town established the Malay Muslim community in South Africa, as the town served as a penal settlement for convicts and political exiles from East Indies. During the Apartheid period, Indonesia joined the rest of the Asian countries in avoiding official relations with South Africa, however in 1968, Indonesia unofficially opened secret military and intelligence relations with South Africa through the Estado Novo regime of Portugal as well as through Israel. It was widely known that from 1968-69 onwards, Indonesia shared intelligence with South Africa and Israel through Portugal, Iran, and Turkey Indonesian-South African relations were formalized through the establishment of diplomatic relations in August 1994. The South African Embassy in Jakarta was established in January 1995 and officially opened by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr A Nzo, on 14 July 1997. The South African Embassy in Jakarta is also accredited to ASEAN in order to maintain close interaction with the regional body, and also accredited to Timor Leste since 2009 on a non-residential basis. Trade and commerce South Africa is Indonesia's largest trade partner in Africa which accounted for 22.18 percent of Indonesia's total trade with Africa in 2011. Trade between the two countries has seen a steady increase over the past few years and has the potential to grow. Bilateral trade between the two countries reached US$2.14 billion in 2011. Indonesia's exports were valued at US$1.44 billion in 2011 while imports were around US$705.78 million, resulting in a US$730.81 million trade surplus in favour of Indonesia. The South African market is one of Indonesia's key non-traditional markets, which is expected to drive future exports.

Life Chiang was born in a Catholic family in Haining, Zhejiang, China, towards the end of the Qing dynasty. He was a maternal cousin of the wuxia novelist Louis Cha. He graduated from Peking University in 1923 with a degree in philosophy, and obtained a government scholarship to study library science at Berlin University and graduated in 1930. In 1933, Chiang started the National Central Library in Nanjing and oversaw its move to Chongqing during the Second Sino-Japanese War. On 1 August 1940, he was appointed as its first director. Between 1940 and 1941, he organised funding for the purchase of rare manuscripts and books collection preservation from collectors in Shanghai to protect them from looting by the Japanese during the war. The library was moved back to Nanjing between 1945 and 1946 after the end of the war. In 1948, the Nationalist government moved the library, along with its core collection of about 130,000 volumes of rare manuscript books, to Taiwan following its defeat by the Communists in the Chinese Civil War. On 23 April 1949, when Communist forces occupied Nanjing towards the end of the Chinese Civil War, Chiang left mainland China and went to Hong Kong before eventually settling down in Taipei, Taiwan. In 1951, Chiang became a professor in the National Taiwan University. About three years later, he was appointed as the director of the National Central Library again after the library was rebuilt in Taipei. In September 1965, he became Director of National Palace Museum in Taipei. A year later, he was reassigned to be the director of the National Central Library. In 1974, he was elected to Academia Sinica, the national academy of Taiwan. In 1983, he resigned from the National Palace Museum and was appointed national policy adviser to President Chiang Ching-kuo. Chiang died on 21 September 1990 in Taipei.

Behanan, who won a, now vacated, NCAA title at Louisville, was going to transfer to Colorado State to redshirt the 2014‚Äì15 season but instead declared for the 2014 NBA draft in which he subsequently went undrafted. Early life and high school Behanan was born and mostly raised in Cincinnati, growing up in a troubled inner city neighborhood infested by the drug culture; one of his older brothers had been arrested on drug charges. He indicated in a 2012 interview that his time in that neighborhood drove him to succeed in basketball: > I just have to stay at it. In my family, I think I'm just the last person > left that can make something happen. If it ain't me, it's nobody.\\" During his childhood, the family home was destroyed in a fire, and he, his mother, and four siblings moved in with one of his grandmothers. Behanan's mother eventually decided that inner-city Cincinnati was not a good place for him, and used family connections to send him to Bowling Green, Kentucky before his junior year of high school. In his senior season at Bowling Green High School, he averaged 23.3 points and 14.4 rebounds. He had previously verbally committed to play college basketball at Cincinnati, but changed his commitment to Louisville while in Bowling Green. Behanan would later say that the change could have saved his life‚Äîa few months after he arrived at Louisville, a longtime friend in Cincinnati was shot and killed during a robbery. Behanan said about the incident, \\"He [the friend] was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. To be honest, I really don't think I'd be here today if I'd stayed in Cincinnati.\\" College career In his freshman year with the Louisville Cardinals, Behanan averaged 9.5 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 26 minutes per game, helping lead the Cardinals to the Final Four, where they lost to eventual national champion Kentucky. A communications major, Behanan made the Dean's List in his first two semesters at Louisville. Although expressing a desire to play in the NBA, Behanan returned for his sophomore season and averaged 9.8 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 26.1 minutes per game, helping lead the Cardinals to win the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, which was Louisville's third national championship and first since 1986. That national championship has since been vacated by the NCAA. Just before the start of the 2013‚Äì14 season, coach Rick Pitino suspended Behanan indefinitely for an unspecified violation of team rules. Behanan was reinstated in time to play against Hofstra on November 12, the second game of the season. In the twelve games that he played in 2013‚Äì14, he averaged 7.6 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 18.6 minutes per game. On December 30, Pitino announced that Behanan was dismissed from the team for violation of university policy. Behanan later admitted that he was dismissed from the team for use of marijuana. On January 27, 2014, it was reported that Behanan had enrolled at Colorado State University. However, before making an appearance for Colorado State, Behanan declared for the 2014 NBA draft. On April 2, 2014, Louisville police cited Behanan for marijuana possession, after Behanan did an interview with local radio station WHBE.

The first book by cartoonist Vera Brosgol, Anya's Ghost was published on June 7, 2011. In the novel, unpopular Anya befriends the ghost of Emily, a girl around Anya's age who died 90 years earlier. After failing to make Anya popular and happy, Emily becomes manipulative and controlling, leading Anya to discover the truth about Emily's death. Anya's Ghost took four years from inception to publication, and is drawn predominantly in hues of violet. Well received by critics, Anya's Ghost is the recipient of Cyblis, Harvey, and Eisner awards. Production on a film adaptation of the novel was supposed to begin by the end of 2017. Plot Annushka Borzakovskaya (Anya) is a Russian √©migr√© living in the United States with her mother and brother (Sasha). Unpopular at her New England private school, Anya skips school and walks through a nearby forest. Not seeing it, Anya falls into a dry well and finds herself alongside a human skeleton. The skeleton's ghost, a shy, homely girl named Emily appears and explains that she too fell down the well and died of dehydration after breaking her neck ninety years ago. Emily wishes to befriend and help Anya, but cannot move far from her bones. Anya is soon rescued by a passerby, but Emily's skeleton remains undiscovered. Emily later appears to Anya at school, Anya having inadvertently taken a finger bone from Emily's skeleton. Anya decides to keep the bone after Emily helps her cheat on a biology exam and spy on her crush, Sean. Emily gives her full name as Emily Reilly and explains that her fianc√© died fighting in World War I, and that her parents were murdered at home. She was running from the killer when she fell down the well. Anya promises to find Emily's killer, while Emily agrees to help Anya fit in at school and win over Sean. As their friendship develops, Anya drifts away from her one friend at school (Siobhan) while Emily becomes disinterested in discovering her murderer's identity. At Emily's insistence, Anya dresses up and goes to a party attended by Sean and his girlfriend Elizabeth. There, Anya discovers that Sean habitually cheats on Elizabeth with her consent. Distraught, Anya leaves the party, which makes Emily angry and confused for she believed Anya and Sean were destined for each other. Anya later notices Emily becoming more controlling and adjusting her appearance by straightening her hair and smoking ghostly cigarettes. Anya goes to the library without Emily to research the killer; there she learns that Emily had no fianc√©, but had instead murdered a young couple in their home after her unrequited love rejected her, and then died running from the authorities. When Anya returns home, the finger bone is missing. After being confronted with the truth, Emily shows that she is capable of moving solid objects, implying she put her finger bone in Anya's bag. Emily begins threatening Anya's family to make Anya comply, even causing Anya's mother to fall down the stairs. After Emily appears before Sasha, he reveals he found the bone earlier; Anya retrieves it and runs to the well, pursued by Emily. Once there, Anya confronts and accuses Emily of trying to live vicariously through her. Emily rebukes Anya, saying that she is no better, and that the two of them are more alike then she wants to admit. After Emily fails to push Anya into the well, Anya drops the bone back in. Emily then possesses her own skeleton, and climbs out to give further chase. Anya stops and instead convinces Emily of the futility of her situation, causing the tearful ghost to dissipate, and the skeleton to fall back into the well. Later, Anya convinces her school to fill the well and rekindles her friendship with Siobhan. Development Writing Brosgol conceived the character of Anya when she was working on Put the Book Back on the Shelf (2006), a comics anthology based on the music of the Scottish indie pop band Belle and Sebastian. She wrote a short story about a disaffected schoolgirl to accompany the song \\"Family Tree\\" (from the band's 2000 album Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant). Brosgol didn't finish the story, but enjoyed drawing \\"that character with her fat little legs and cigarettes.\\" Then, after reading Haruki Murakami's novel The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, she decided her unnamed character should fall down a well. The rest of the story came later, drawn from the author's own life and other inspiration. Brosgol started work on Anya's Ghost in 2007. Production As Anya's Ghost was her first book, Brosgol said that its production was an exercise in trial and error. Brosgol does not work from a script, saying that \\"the art and the dialogue come at the same time and one suggests the other\\". She prefers to illustrate events rather than use dialogue in her comics. Working from a detailed outline, Brosgol drew thumbnails of each panel‚Äîtwo to a page in a Moleskine notebook‚Äîand wrote the dialogue as she went along. From her thumbnails, Brosgol used her Wacom Cintiq to draw a rough version of the ultimate art. This rough version of Anya's Ghost went to her editor for approval. After approval, Brosgol went back through her rough draft and \\"tightened the roughs up just enough so that [she] could ink them\\". She then used paintbrushes (being especially particular about her Winsor & Newton Series 7s) to paint on Canson translucent vellum atop her printed-out rough draft. Brosgol inked the panels and speech balloons first, adding in the lettering digitally later with a custom font developed for her by John Martz; she colored the novel in Adobe Photoshop. Anya's Ghost is drawn in what Pamela Paul called a \\"deep violet palette\\" that Brosgol called \\"purpley-blue\\". The artist herself said she chose the colors \\"for no other reason than I like purpley-blue and I think it feels right for the story\\". Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times interpreted the colors as \\"a subtle underscoring of Anya's bruised ego\\". Publication Having worked on Kazu Kibuishi's Flight comics, Brosgol contacted his talent agent Judith Hansen who had agreed to look at the work of anybody involved. After completing the art for Anya's Ghost in 2009, Brosgol brought it to Hansen, who agreed to represent the artist. Brosgol finished the cover art in 2010, and then \\"there's a full year on the end for printing, and marketing, and all of that which comes with a book publisher.\\" The book was published on June 7, 2011 by First Second Books. Reception Anya's Ghost won the 2011 Cybils literary award in the Young Adult category. It also won the 2012 Harvey Award for \\"Best Original Graphic Publication for Younger Readers\\" and the 2012 Eisner Award for \\"Best Publication for Young Adults (Ages 12‚Äì17)\\". Anya's Ghost was nominated for the 2011 Bram Stoker Award for Best Graphic Novel, but lost to Neonomicon by Alan Moore. The Los Angeles Times Susan Carpenter reviewed the graphic novel and described it as \\"a well-paced story that feels dynamic and also intimate.\\" She further lauded the work, calling it \\"humorous\\" and \\"beautifully drawn\\". Pamela Paul of The New York Times compared Anya's Ghost positively to Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, saying that the novel felt real (even with its supernatural elements) and that Anya was \\"a smart, funny and compassionate portrait of someone who, for all her sulking and sneering, is the kind of daughter many parents would like to have.\\" Wired Kathy Ceceri also noted an artistic similarity to Persepolis; she not only liked how Anya's Ghost intertwined the teenage angst and fantasy elements of the novel, but praised how Anya's desire for a boyfriend doesn't overwhelm the story. Cory Doctorow reviewed Anya's Ghost for Boing Boing, calling it \\"really sweet, really funny and really scary, [with] a powerful message about identity, fitting in, and the secret selfish bastard lurking in all of us and whether having such a goblin inside makes us irredeemable or merely human.\\" Whitney Matheson with USA Today wrote that Anya's Ghost is a \\"funny, creepy and a delightful page- turner\\" and cited author Neil Gaiman who called the novel \\"a masterpiece\\". Steve Duin of The Oregonian praised the inventiveness of Brosgol's storytelling, and called her art \\"[a] little uneven, but ... at its best when the lights go out.\\" Almost six years after its publication, Paste listed Anya's Ghost as a comic having \\"the potential to mean something special, to offer something valuable and important, whether that‚Äôs revelatory depth or escapist fun, to a young reader.\\" Film development Andy and Barbara Muschietti, director and producer of the 2013 horror film Mama, bought the film rights to Anya's Ghost in 2015. That October, they were speaking with scriptwriter Patrick Ness for a screenplay, and in August 2017, Deadline Hollywood announced that, with a script by Ness, production of the Anya's Ghost film would \\"begin before year‚Äôs end.\\" Dan Mazer will direct, Jeremy Bolt and Benedict Carver will produce, and Entertainment One is financing the film. Bolt described Ness as \\"passionate about the source material\\", having written a \\"fresh and distinctive\\" screenplay; Bolt went on to describe the film as a \\"classic high school comedy with a supernatural twist.\\" According to Deadline Hollywood, Emma Roberts has been cast to star in the film.

The channel was created by DigitalRev CEO and producer Richard Yu and was co-produced and presented by Kai Man Wong. DigitalRev TV routinely published new product reviews, parodies, challenges and how-to guides.DigitalRev TV publishes video guide to painting a DSLR pink - ZDNet For a long time the most subscribed to photography channel on Youtube, with nearly 1.9 million subscribers as of 26 April 2018, changes to the presentation staff since late 2016 have led to a very low frequency of video publication. Sister YouTube channel DigitalRev Plus has also published only intermittent content in this time period. The most recent video uploaded to the channel was published on October 18th, 2019, and is considered the last video of the channel. Background Known for its funny and irreverent style in the vein of Top Gear the channel's original videos were surprisingly spartan. The channel began in 2007 with a format that usually involved a fixed-camera view of a lone reviewer's hands showing off the details of a particular photography product available at its store. In each video, there was an un-boxing of a product and run down of some of its features. The format changed when Kai Man Wong became the lead presenter. He brought with him a new personal style of presentation with location shooting and diversified the channel's output away from displaying to actively testing products, making group comparisons, and looking at wider aspects of photography such as techniques, construction projects and camera culture. Richard Yu became the unseen 'bloody producer' who sets impossible challenges. In 2015 when Wong moved to the UK, the channel's content was produced by a team in Hong Kong and by Wong in the UK. DRTV worked with Bellamy Hunt (Japan Camera Hunter) on some of their videos (usually featuring camera shops of Japan, and 35mm film cameras), and occasionally The Mijonju Show was referenced. Presenters Kai Man Wong was the main presenter of DigitalRev from December 2009 and was joined by camera man and editor Lok Cheung in 2010 (with whom he had previously worked on another company).) In 2011 Alamby Leung, the channel's then project coordinator, began to make appearances in the show resulting in the channel's classic line-up. Change came after the departure of Leung in 2013, and the introduction of DigitalRev's Bokeh blog and Bokeh YouTube channel in 2014. From 2015 Kai presented videos from East Anglia in the UK, often with British fashion photographer Paul John Bayfield, while Lok fronted Hong Kong-based episodes with Ian Wong and Warren Ng. Other former contributors have included Garcia, Barry, Asuka, Rita Law and Hannah Scott. Kai and Lok left DigitalRev in November and December 2016 respectively. Both made an announcement on their personal YouTube channels. Warren Ng and Ian Wong also made announcements shortly after that they have also left DigitalRev TV. From 2017 onwards, Rebecca Leung, Eugene Chan and Tianran He have taken over hosting on the channel and new videos have started to sporadically appear on the channel.

This psychotherapeutic intervention draws on a range of models and techniques including dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), mindfulness meditation, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and experiential exercises. CEBT has been used primarily with individuals suffering from eating disorders, as it offers an alternative when standard CBT is unsuccessful in relieving symptoms. Research indicates that CEBT may help reduce emotional eating, depression, and anxiety and also improve self-esteem. CEBT was developed in 2006 by British psychologist Emma Gray (n√©e Corstorphine). Its key components include psychological education; techniques to enhance awareness of emotions and motivation to change; and strategies to restructure beliefs about the experience and expression of emotions. Although (CEBT) was initially developed to help individuals suffering from eating disorders, its effectiveness in helping people to better understand and manage their emotions has meant that it is increasingly being used by psychologists as a 'pretreatment' to prepare patients for the process of therapy for a range of problems including anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can often be emotionally challenging.  Techniques  Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) - DBT is a type of psychotherapy used to treat various disorders. The purpose of this therapy is to help create positive changes in a person‚Äôs behavior. DBT focuses mainly on treating individuals who suffer from bulimia, drug-dependence, borderline personality disorder, depression, and other psychological disorders. Mindfulness meditation - Mindfulness meditation is a technique that increases and improves awareness. This technique aims to lower stress and improve our attention. It is a form of focusing on what is presently happening. Mindfulness meditation aims at improving mental health through helping those with disorders be able to manage their emotions. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) - Acceptance and commitment therapy is a treatment aimed at helping people to accept the feelings and experiences they go through. Oftentimes people must deal with unpleasant feelings, thoughts or experiences and in response they avoid those emotions as a way of coping. In regards to the way we react, ACT helps with acceptance, making a decision to make changes, and going through with that commitment. Experiential exercises - Experiential exercises play an important part in CEBT because it allows individuals to become actively involved in the learning process. Experiencing what is being taught can have a positive impact on those individuals who experience emotional and behavioral difficulties. These exercises are often used in different types of therapy in order to help individuals learn about diversity, acceptance, injustice, and so forth. Experiential exercises can be incorporated in the treatment of individuals dealing with disorders. These exercises help people to know how to react or cope in certain situations.  Background  In 2006, Dr. Emma Corstorphine started the idea of Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy (CEBT). CEBT uses techniques from other types of treatment such as Cognitive behavior therapy and Dialectical behavioral therapy. The main goal of CEBT is to help individuals learn to cope with their emotions, reduce stress and anxiety, and make changes to their behavior. Corstorphine noted that emotion plays a crucial part in disorders, therefore it needs to be further addressed in terms of treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy aims to treat where a patient needs the most help, whether that is emotional, behavioral, cognitive, etc. CBT has been practiced since the 1960s. There is a greater focus on cognitive psychology and its impact on behavior. In 2003 there began to be suggestions that CBT needed to be expanded to meet the needs of even more specific vulnerabilities such as emotion, social environments, relationships, etc. Corstorphine saw the need for an approach that has a greater focus on the emotional components. Corstorphine‚Äôs research specifically analyzes cognitive emotional behavioral therapy (CBT) for eating disorders. She found that CBT and related techniques for bulimia were not effective. CBT mainly uses treatments aimed at discovering cognitive or behavioral issues to be the source. Corstorphine‚Äôs findings show that therapy focused on emotion helped individuals manage their emotions and difficulties. Research has shown that emotional distress is a major cause of bulimia. Additional studies show that what triggers bulimia is oftentimes one‚Äôs emotional state and their relationships. CEBT helps these individuals with disorders to cope with their emotions and develop the skills necessary to positively handle their situation.  Case  Corstorphine analyzes a case to determine whether cognitive emotional behavior therapy for eating disorders (CEBT-ED) is effective. In this case, a 22 year old woman named Anna who suffers from Bulimia and Anorexia goes through CBT and is able to regulate some of her eating patterns and lower the number of times she purges. It was acknowledged that Anna had emotional trauma due to the environment she grew up in. Her self esteem and expression of emotion were repressed because of her family. CEBT-ED allowed her to feel encouraged to show her emotions and discover the source of her difficulties. CEBT is an effective way of easing the symptoms of cognitive and emotional disorders when the typical CBT does not provide sufficient exercises and training.Slyter, M. (2012). Treating eating disorders with the Buddhist tradition of mindfulness. Ideas and Research You Can Use: VISTAS, 32(1), 1-12. Emotion is the primary issue of eating disorders. In Anna's case CBT would have been helpful but would have focused mainly on changing negative or unreasonable thoughts. At the center of Anna's problem was her emotional trauma as a child and her difficulty in expressing how she felt. To address Anna's specific needs, CBT was not enough, but CEBT allowed room for self- reflection to find the root of her issues. CEBT helped her to identify and understand her emotions, allowing her to learn skills that would help her cope with these emotions and relieve the symptoms of her issues.

Organization includes 4 all-Russian sports Federations: Russian Alpine Skiing and Snowboard Federation, Cross-Country Ski Federation of Russia, Freestyle Federation of Russia, Ski Jumping and Nordic Combined Federation of Russia. Members of the Russian Ski Association are represented in the International Ski Federation (FIS). Officials of the Russian Ski Association *President - Andrey Bokarev *Vice-president - Alexander Cherkasov *General secretary - Georgiy Mnatsakanov History of the Russian Ski Association The Russian Ski Association (RSA) was founded in 2005 on the basis of The Russian Ski Union. The Russian Ski Union was founded in 1994 and it had combined the Cross- Country Ski Federation of Russia, the Nordic Combined and Ski Jumping Federation of Russia, the Freestyle Federation of Russia, the Alpine Skiing and Snowboard Federation of Russia. The reason of establishing of the Union was the necessity of uniting all of these 4 Federations for representing Russian Federation in international organizations, and first of all in the International Ski Federation (FIS). Due to the regulations of FIS one country can be represented only by one federation (association). The idea of uniting different sports organisations into one federation or association is realised in such countries as Austria, Norway, Finland, Sweden, France and Italy. In 1999 the Russian Government gave a direction to public organizations of Russia to re-register. But The Russian Ski Union was able to be re-registered only under conditions that the 4 federations had already been re-registered. Some federations were late with this procedure so the Russian Ski Union wasn't re- registered either. The Union existed relatively till 2005, actively representing the Russian Federation on the international field. In 2005 the decision was made to recreate the Union. Its new name was more relevant for the International Ski Association. The Russian Ski Association has a great authority in the world: 18 representatives of the Russian Federation work in different FIS Committees nowadays. The International Ski Federation conducts international meetings two times a year and once in two years, it conducts ordinary Congress to hear reports and elect new officials. Our delegates take actively part in these meetings. The President of Russian Ski Association is a major figure for FIS. He is a binding member of the Russian delegation during the International Congress and other great international forums. Russian Ski Association is one of the largest Russian Associations of Olympic winter sports. Every year about 20 winter sports competitions are carried out in Russia, and all of them are officially announced in the FIS events calendar. The Cross-Country World Cup, the World freestyle, snowboard and alpine ski Championships are among them. Today as a part of preparations for the Olympic Games Sochi-2014, a new sports centers is being built. It has a stadium, ski jumping hills, alpine skiing tracks and slopes for freestyle and snowboarding. The commissioning of this sports center on the territory of Russian Federation will give a possibility to hold Championships and World Cups in all ski disciplines and increase the image of RSA on the world arena. The Russian Ski Association is recognized by the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) and included in the register of Russian public organizations.

W. by N.) from Castle-Douglas, and 19 (N. by W.) from Kirkcudbright; containing, with the burgh of New Galloway, 1121 inhabitants. History and description This place is supposed by some to derive its name from its elevated situation, of which, in the Gaelic language, the word is descriptive; others deduce it from the British Cell, on account of the extensive woods formerly existing here, and of which considerable remains are still found imbedded in the various mosses. The parish, which is one of the largest in the county, is bounded on the west and south by the river Dee, which separates it from the parishes of Minnigaff, Girthon, and Balmaghie; and on the east by the river Ken, which divides it from Dalry, Balmaclellan, and Parton. It is about sixteen miles in length and eight miles in extreme breadth, comprising an area of 47,500 acres, of which by far the greater part is mountain pasture, and, with the exception of about 400 acres of woodland and plantations, the remainder is arable and in good cultivation. The surface is irregularly broken, rising towards the north into a range of lofty mountains, including the most conspicuous heights of Galloway, of which some have an elevation of 2700 feet above the sea. The arable lands, which are chiefly along the banks of the Ken, are tolerably level, and interspersed with copses of oak and birch. The lower grounds are watered by numerous rivulets, which intersect the parish in various directions, and form tributaries to the Dee and to the Ken. The Ken has its source on the confines of Dumfriesshire, and, after entering the parish on the north-east, receives the waters of the Deuch, and at the southern extremity unites with the Dee. There are also many lakes, of which those of Loch Dungeon and Loch Harrow, in the north, are of considerable extent, but both inferior to Loch Ken, on the eastern border of the parish, which is about five miles in length and three quarters of a mile in breadth, and by far the most eminent for the beauty of its scenery. The soil of the lands along the Ken is a rich clay, producing good crops of oats, but not in larger quantity than is sufficient for home consumption. The hills in the parish are chiefly of granite: there are neither mines nor quarries of any description. The remains of ancient wood are principally copses of oak and birch, both of which are indigenous, and appear well adapted to the soil; and the plantations, which are of recent formation, consist of oak, intermixed with Scotch fir and larch, and are well managed, and in a flourishing condition. Kenmure Castle, the seat of Lord Viscount Kenmure, the principal landed proprietor, is a very ancient structure, is seated on a circular mount, at the head of Loch Ken, within a mile of the town of New Galloway, and is supposed to have been the residence of John Balliol. It suffered frequent assaults during the wars with England in the time of Edward I; and was burnt in the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, and again during the usurpation of Cromwell. The estate subsequently belonged to the Gordons, of Lochinvar, of whom Sir John was created Lord of Lochinvar and Viscount Kenmure, in 1633; but it became forfeited to the crown in the time of William, the sixth viscount, who was attainted for his participation in the rebellion of 1715, and beheaded on Tower Hill, London, in the following year. The property was, however, purchased from the crown by a member of his family; and the title was restored by act of parliament, in 1824, to his grandson, the late viscount and proprietor. The grounds are tastefully embellished with stately timber and thriving plantations, and the approach to the castle is by a noble avenue of lime trees. Glenlee is a handsome mansion, which has been greatly enlarged, and is finely situated on the banks of the Ken, in a park embellished with many oaks of majestic growth. The church erected in 1822, is a handsome structure in the early English style of architecture, with a square embattled tower; it contains 560 sittings, and can be made to hold a greater number. The Glenkens Society annually award prizes to the most deserving of the scholars. A school-house has recently been erected in the northern part of the parish, by Mr. Kennedy, of Knocknalling, who pays the salary of the master; and there is also a Sabbath school, to which is attached a good library. The poor are partly supported by the interest of ¬£522 bequeathed by various individuals, in the hands of the Kirk Session. There are several chalybeate springs in the parish, of which one, on Cairn-Edward, about two miles from New Galloway, was formerly in great repute, and is still used by the inhabitants in its neighbourhood. Notable residents Among the natives of the parish have been the poet John Lowe, 1750-98, the author of Mary's Dream; Robert Heron, author of a History of Scotland; Thomas Gordon, the translator of Tacitus; and the Rev. William Gillespie, author of the Progress of Refinement, of Consolation, and other works; and Very Rev Dr Nathaniel Paterson Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1850/51.

Southwick Church at Caulkerbush Colvend and Southwick is a community council area and civil parish within the Stewartry area of Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It is also part of the Church of Scotland parish of Colvend, Southwick and Kirkbean. It is in the historic county of Kirkcudbrightshire. Colvend Church was designed by architect Peter MacGregor Chalmers in 1911. Southwick Church designed by Peddie & Kinnear 1891. Southwick House, C18th/19th mansion house, home of Sir Mark McTaggart- Stewart MP, Baronet (1834 -1923), MP for Wigtown Burghs from 1874‚Äì80 Kirkcudbrightshire between 1885 and 1910. From A topographical dictionary of Scotland (1846) In 1846 the Civil Parish contained 1495 inhabitants, of whom 875 were in Colvend. The former of these places is supposed to have derived its name from John de Culwen, its proprietor in the fifteenth century, and the latter from the position of its ancient church, now in ruins, with reference to a small river which flows through the parish into Solway Firth. After the dilapidation of the church of Southwick, that parish was annexed to Colvend, with which it has been united from the time of the Reformation. The parish extended for about eight miles from north-east to south-west, and was partly bounded on the south-east by the Solway Firth. It was nearly four miles and the river Urr formed its south-western limit. The surface is extremely irregular, and is so broken into detached portions by intervening masses of rock and impenetrable copses of furze and briars, as to render it unpracticable to ascertain, with any degree of correctness, the probable number of acres under cultivation. The ground in some parts rises into numerous hills of moderate height, and in other parts, especially towards the north, into mountainous elevation forming a chain of heights skirting the lofty and conspicuous mountain of Criffel. For nearly two miles along the eastern coast the surface is tolerably level, and divided into several fields of good arable land. The coast is bold and rocky, and in many places rises into lofty and precipitous cliffs, overhanging the Firth, from which, at low water, the sea retires, leaving a broad tract of level sands. In the crevices of these rocks is found abundance of samphire, of which considerable quantities are collected with great hazard. The Firth is about nine leagues in breadth at this place; the river Urr is navigable for eight miles from it, for vessels of not more than eighty tons, and the Southwick burn joins the Frith on the boundary of the parish. The salmon-fishery is carried on upon a small scale, and during the season smelts are also found; cod is taken with lines during the winter, and flounders, in 1834, were taken in such numbers that cart-loads were distributed throughout the neighbouring parishes. The soil is generally a thin light loam, and, though warm and fertile, better adapted for pasture than for tillage; the chief crops are, oats and barley, with potatoes, turnips, and clover. The system of agriculture is improved, and much of the previously unprofitable waste land has been reclaimed. The cattle are principally of the Galloway breed; the sheep are the black-faced, and about fifty scores of that kind are pastured on the hills. The rateable annual value of the parish is ¬£6006. On the estates of Fairgirth and Barnhourie, are considerable tracts of ancient wood; and the plantations of more modern date are also extensive, and consist chiefly of oak and Scotch fir, both of which are in a thriving state. The prevailing rocks are granite, of which there are quarries; stone of good quality for millstones is also raised, and there are evident indications of copper and iron, but no attempt has yet been made to work either of the veins. At the mouth of the river Urr small vessels are built, and there is a landing-place for unloading cargoes of lime and other articles, and for shipping the agricultural produce to Liverpool, Glasgow, and other ports. The ecclesiastical affairs of the parish are under the superintendence of the presbytery and synod of Dumfries. The minister's stipend is ¬£234. 14. 6., with a manse, and a glebe valued at ¬£20 per annum; joint patrons, the Crown and the Duke of Buccleuch. The church is a plain structure, erected in 1771, and totally inadequate to the population. There is a place of worship for members of the Secession Synod. Parochial schools are supported at Colvend and Southwick, of which the masters have each a salary of ¬£26. 13.; the former has only fees averaging ¬£15, and the latter has a house and garden, with fees amounting to ¬£36. There are numerous caverns on the shore, in one of which, about 120 yards in length, is a well twenty-two feet deep, into which a piper is supposed to have fallen while attempting to explore the interior of the cavern; and near it is a detached portion of rock, formed naturally into an arch forty feet in height, called the Needle's Eye. In one of the clefts of the rocks, is a strong chalybeate spring; and at Auchenskeoch, in Southwick, are the remains of a large castellated building of which the history is unknown.

The Iliad notes this meal with regard to a labor-weary woodsman eager for a light repast to start his day, preparing it even as he is aching with exhaustion.Anderson, pg 9 The opening prose of the 16th book of The Odyssey mentions breakfast as the meal being prepared in the morning before attending to one's chores.Homer, The Odyssey (London: Macmillan, 2005), 265 Eventually ariston was moved to around noon, and a new morning meal was introduced. In the post-Homeric classical period of Greece, a meal called akratisma was typically consumed immediately after rising in the morning.

Douglas Olson, The Learned Banqueters, Volume VII: Books 13.594b-14, Loeb Classical Library, 2011, pp. 277‚Äì78 Ancient Rome Romans called breakfast jentaculum (or ientaculum). It was usually composed of everyday staples like bread, cheese, olives, salad, nuts, raisins, and cold meat left over from the night before. They also drank wine-based drinks such as mulsum, a mixture of wine, honey, and aromatic spices. First-century Latin poet Martial said that jentaculum was eaten at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, while 16th-century scholar Claudius Saumaise wrote that it was typically eaten at 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. It seems unlikely that any fixed time was truly assigned for this meal. Roman soldiers woke up to a breakfast of pulmentus, porridge similar to the Italian polenta, made from roasted spelt wheat or barley that was then pounded and cooked in a cauldron of water.Encyclopedia of Food and Culture, vol 1, pg 244 Middle Ages (500‚Äì1500) Europe A medieval baker with his apprentice. As seen in the illustration, round loaves were among the most common. In the European Middle Ages, breakfast was not usually considered a necessary and important meal, and was practically nonexistent during the earlier medieval period. Monarchs and their entourages would spend much time around a table for meals. Only two formal meals were eaten per day‚Äîone at mid- day and one in the evening. The exact times varied by period and region, but this two-meal system remained consistent throughout the Middle Ages. The literal definition of breakfast is ‚Äòbreaking the fast‚Äô of nighttime slumber, and many written accounts in the medieval period seem to reprimand eating in the morning. Breakfast was under Catholic theological criticism. The influential 13th-century Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas wrote in his Summa Theologica (1265‚Äì1274) that breakfast committed \\"praepropere,\\" or the sin of eating too soon, which was associated with gluttony. Overindulgences and gluttony were frowned upon and were considered boorish by the Catholic Church, as they presumed that if one ate breakfast, it was because one had other lusty appetites as well, such as ale or wine. Breakfast in some times and places was solely granted to children, the elderly, the sick, and to working men. Anyone else did not speak of or partake in eating in the morning. Eating breakfast meant that one was poor, was a low-status farmer or laborer who truly needed the energy to sustain his morning's labor, or was too weak to make it to the large, midday dinner. Because medieval people saw gluttony as a sin and a sign of weakness, men were often ashamed of eating breakfast. Noble travelers were an exception, as they were also permitted to eat breakfast while they were away from home. For instance, in March 1255 about 1512 gallons of wine were delivered to the English King Henry III at the abbey church at St. Albans for his breakfast throughout his trip. If a king were on religious pilgrimage, the ban on breakfast was completely lifted and enough supplies were compensated for the erratic quality of meals at the local cook shops during the trip. In the 13th century, breakfast when eaten sometimes consisted of a piece of rye bread and a bit of cheese. Morning meals would not include any meat, and would likely include ¬º gallon (1.1 L; 0.30 US gal) of low alcohol-content beers. Uncertain quantities of bread and ale could have been consumed in between meals. By the 15th century breakfast in western Europe often included meat. By this time, noble men were seen to indulge in breakfast, making it more of a common practice, and by the early 16th century, recorded expenses for breakfast became customary. By the other way breakfast in eastern Europe remained mostly the same as we know it today: a \\"continental breakfast\\". The 16th-century introduction of caffeinated beverages into the European diet was part of the consideration to allow breakfast. It was believed that coffee and tea aid the body in \\"evacuation of superfluities,\\" and was consumed in the morning. Modern breakfast (1500‚Äìpresent) Africa Traditionally, the various cuisines of Africa use a combination of locally available fruits, cereal grains and vegetables, as well as milk and meat products. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features milk, curd and whey products. A type of porridge is most commonly eaten. In the book The Bible cyclop√¶dia (et al.) published in 1843, it was documented that during this time in the Arab world, Bedouins often utilized locusts mixed with butter for breakfast, spreading the mixture on unleavened bread.Goodhugh; Cooke Taylor 1843, p. 779. =Egypt= In the book The Bible cyclop√¶dia (et al.) published in 1843, it was documented that Egyptians were early risers that sometimes had a first meal consisting of coffee along with the smoking of a pipe, and did not eat breakfast until noon.Goodhugh; Cooke Taylor 1843, p. 843. At this time, it was documented that Egyptian breakfast foods included bread, cheese, eggs, butter, curds, clotted cream and stewed beans. In addition, fava beans (Ful Madamas) are an established national breakfast dish.Bsisu, May (2005). The Arab Table: Recipes and Culinary Traditions. HarperCollins. p. 105. Asia In the Middle East region of Asia, Middle Eastern cuisine is popular. Iftar refers to the evening meal when Muslims break their sawm (fast) during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Iftar is one of the religious observances of Ramadan, and is often done as a community, with people gathering to break their fast together. Iftar is done right after Maghrib (sunset) time. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims replace traditional breakfast with suhoor, an Islamic term referring to the meal consumed early in the morning by Muslims before sawm during daylight hours. The meal is eaten before fajr (dawn). =Israel= =Japan= In Japan, it is common to eat Miso soup, and rice soup (porridge hybrid jook) for breakfast. =Lebanon= In the book The Bible cyclop√¶dia (et al.) it was documented that circa 1843, poor Lebanese people would consume raw leeks with bread for breakfast.Goodhugh; Cooke Taylor 1843, p. 755. Europe =Austria= The croissant appears to have originated in Vienna, Austria, in 1683.Calvel, Raymond (2001). The Taste of Bread. Springer. p. 141. Scott-Hamilton, Carolyn (2012). The Healthy Voyager's Global Kitchen: 150 Plant-Based Recipes From Around the World. Fair Winds. p. 115. =France= French breakfasts are often similar to what Americans call a continental breakfast.Kittler, Pamela Goyan; Sucher, Kathryn P. (2007). Food and Culture. Cengage Learning. p. 151. French breakfast pastries include apple turnovers, brioche, croissantClarke, Stephen (2012). 1000 Years of Annoying the French. Open Road Media. p. (unlisted). and pain au chocolat.Edelstein, Sari (2010). Food, Cuisine, and Cultural Competency for Culinary, Hospitality, and Nutrition Professionals. Jones & Bartlett Learning. p. 138. Croissants have been described as becoming a standard fare in French breakfast cuisine by 1875. =Netherlands= The word waffle derives from the Dutch word \\"wafel\\", which itself derives from the Middle Dutch wafele, and is likely the origin of the food as it is known today.Duda, Carlene (2007). Beyond Oatmeal: 101 Breakfast Recipes. Cedar Fort. p. 83. .A continental breakfast =United Kingdom= An English full breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage, black pudding, bacon, mushrooms, baked beans, hash browns, and half a tomato In the early sixteenth century, some physicians warned against eating breakfast, because they said it was not healthy to eat before a prior meal was digested. By the 1550s, however, there were multiple sources that claimed breakfast was an important meal. For example, in 1551, Thomas Wingfield stated that breakfast was essential. In 1589, Thomas Cogan stated that it was unhealthy to miss breakfast in the morning. He was one of the first to claim that it was healthy for those who were not young, ill or elders to eat breakfast. The full breakfast is a staple of British cuisine, and typically consists of bacon, sausages and eggs, often served with a variety of side dishes and a beverage such as coffee or tea. Prior to 1600, breakfast in Great Britain typically included bread, cold meat or fish, and ale. Tea, chocolate and coffee were introduced to Great Britain in the mid-1600s, and in the 1700s coffee and chocolate were adopted as breakfast drinks by the fashionable.Mason, Laura (2004). Food Culture In Great Britain. pp. 34‚Äì35. Greenwood Publishing Group. Tea eventually became more popular than chocolate as a breakfast drink. North America The first groups known to have produced maple syrup and maple sugar were indigenous peoples living in the northeastern part of North America. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. =Canada= Lumberjacks While it has been a source of controversy where the lumberjack breakfast came from, the most cited source is that the lumberjack breakfast was first served in a Vancouver Hotel, in 1870. The breakfast consisted of eggs galore, assorted fried pork strips, slabs, slices, and flapjacks. It is said by Anita Stewart that the tradition of hearty cooking developed because of men needing the energy for manual labor. =United States= In 1620, waffles were first introduced to North America by pilgrims who had lived in the Netherlands.Serna-Saldivar, Sergio O. (2012). Cereal Grains: Laboratory Reference and Procedures Manual. CRC Press. p. 270. Later pioneers consumed largely cornmeal-based breakfasts, and would also consume corn based meals such as oatmeal for dinner and lunch. Common breakfast products included corn pone, johnnycakes, ashcakes, hoe-cakes, and corn dodgers. Ashcakes consisted of cornmeal wrapped in cabbage leaves cooked in the ashes of a campfire, while corn pone, corn dodgers, and hoe-cakes differed only in baking methods. After the Civil War, it became fairly common in America to eat sandwiches that were made of ham and eggs. These sandwiches were not strictly consumed in the morning. In 1897, the first true breakfast sandwich recipe was published in a cookbook. Sausage, egg and cheese sandwich Popcorn cereal was consumed by Americans in the 1800s, which typically consisted of popcorn with milk and a sweetener.Smith, Andrew F. (1999). Popped Culture: The Social History of Popcorn in America. Univ of South Carolina Press. pp. 57‚Äì59. Cold breakfast cereal has been consumed by Americans since the late 1890s, and during the 1920s a considerable number of new cereals were marketed.Drowne, Kathleen Morgan; Huber, Patrick (2004). Nineteen Twenties. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 122. . The reason for this movement towards cold breakfast cereals was inspired by the Jacksonian-era Clean Living Movement (1830‚Äì1860). This movement focused on a lot of lifestyle changes, but specific to breakfast it claimed that eating bacon, eggs, pancakes and hot coffee was too indulgent. The first prepared cold breakfast cereal marketed to American consumers was created by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, who introduced it in 1878 and named it granola.Sivulka 2011, pp. 87‚Äì90. The product was prepared with baked wheat, oatmeal and cornmeal, and was the first brand-name breakfast cereal in the United States. Canned fruit juice became prominent as a breakfast beverage after the discovery of vitamins.Smith, Andrew F. (2007). The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink. Oxford University Press. p. 69. . Circa 1900, orange juice as a breakfast beverage was a new concept. The development of frozen orange juice concentrate began in 1915, and in the 1930s it was produced by several companies.Smith, Andrew F. (2013). Drinking History: Fifteen Turning Points in the Making of American Beverages. Columbia University Press. p. (unlisted). Additionally, mass-produced tomato juice began to be marketed in the mid-1920s, and became a popular breakfast drink a few years thereafter.

Moder hekler, 1890 Wilhelm Laurits Wetlesen (28 November 1871 ‚Äì 15 June 1925) was a Norwegian painter and illustrator. He was part of the circle around painter Erik Werenskiold. Biography Wetlesen was born at Sandefjord in Vestfold, Norway. He was the son of Christine Margrethe Christensen and her husband John Eliseus Sanne Wetlesen. He studied art in Kristiania (now Oslo) and in Copenhagen, Denmark. He later became a student at the painting school of Kristian Zahrtmann, studying there in the years 1889, 1890, 1892 and 1894. Zahrtmann became his mentor, and eventually also a good friend. Zahrtmann and Wetlesen went on a total of three study trips to Italy. Wetlesen also traveled to Paris with other painters, and he lived for long periods in the Italian cities of Florence and Rome. During this period, Wetlesen mostly painted Danish-inspired interior motifs and pictures of Florentine landscapes. He debuted at the Autumn Exhibition (H√∏stutstillingen ) at Oslo in 1892. In 1898, Erik Werenskiold recommended Wetlesen to replace Halfdan Egedius, who had become ill, to take part in illustrating for the 1899 edition of the Old Norse saga Heimskringla of Snorri Sturluson. Wetlesen made 43 illustrations for the book, although his drawings have been considered to not convey the \\"saga atmosphere\\" as good as the other five illustrators. After 1900, Wetlesen painted Norwegian landscapes in various parts of the country, including in Telemark, J√¶ren, and Vestfold. He also stayed at Lillehammer, where he especially worked with the artists Alf Lundeby, Lars Jorde and Frederik Collett. From 1908 he joined the painter colony in Kviteseid. At an early age, Wetlesen was struck with a debilitating heart condition, which combined with his artistic modesty and self-criticism probably contributed to that he did not fully live up to his expectations. His mentor Zahrtmann had also been concerned by his reported indolence. Wetlesen was nonetheless socially outgoing and a centre for his friends and the Norwegian art scene, and he took initiative to establish the artist association Kunstnerforbundet in 1910, and was the first chairman for the organisation from 1911 to 1912. Wetlesen died in Oslo in 1925.

The weapon was installed on for field testing in 2014. In December 2014, the United States Navy reported that the LaWS system worked perfectly against low-end asymmetric threats, and that the commander of Ponce is authorized to use the system as a defensive weapon. Purpose The LaWS is a ship-defense system that has so far publicly engaged an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or drone) and a simulated small-boat attacker. LaWS uses an infrared beam from a solid-state laser array which can be tuned to high output to destroy the target or low output to warn or cripple the sensors of a target. Among the advantages of this device versus projectile weapons is the low cost per shot, as each firing of the weapon requires only the minimal cost of generating the energetic pulse; by contrast ordnance for projectile weapons must be designed, manufactured, handled, transported and maintained, and takes up storage space. The LaWS is designed to be used against low-end asymmetric threats. Scalable power levels allow it to be used on low-power to dazzle a person's eye to non-lethally make them turn away from a threatening posture, and increase to 30 thousand watts (30 kW) to fry sensors, burn out motors, and detonate explosive materials. Against a vital point on small UAVs, one can be shot down in as little as two seconds. When facing small boats, the laser would target a craft's motor to disable it and make it \\"dead in the water,\\" then repeating this against others in rapid succession, requiring only a few seconds of firing per boat. Targeting the platform is more effective than individual crewmembers, although the LaWS is accurate enough to target explosive rockets if on board, whose detonations could kill the operators. Against a larger aircraft like a helicopter, LaWS can burn through some vital components to cause it to fall and crash.Star Wars At Sea: Navy‚Äôs Laser Gets Real ‚Äì Breakingdefense.com, December 10, 2014 History In 2010, Kratos Defense & Security Solutions was awarded an $11 million contract to support the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) in the development of LaWS for the U.S. Navy's Directed Energy and Electric Weapon Systems (DE&EWS;) program. The May 2012 NSWC test used a close-in weapon control system to enable the beam director to track an unmanned aerial vehicle target. The LaWS was to be installed on USS Ponce in summer 2014 for a 12-month trial deployment. The Navy spent about $40 million over the past six years on research, development, and testing of the laser weapon. It is directed to targets by the Phalanx CIWS radar. With tests going well, the Navy expected to deploy a laser weapon operationally between 2017 and 2021 with an effective range of . The exact level of power the LaWS will use is unknown but estimated between 15‚Äì50 kW for engaging small aircraft and high-speed boats. Directed-energy weapons are being pursued for economic reasons, as they can be fired for as little as one dollar per shot, while conventional gun rounds and missiles can cost thousands of dollars each. The Navy has a history of testing energy weapons, including megawatt chemical lasers in the 1980s. Their chemicals were found to be too hazardous for shipboard use, so they turned to less powerful fiber solid-state lasers. Other types can include slab solid state and free electron lasers.Navy‚Äôs Laser Gun Nears Critical Test ‚Äì Nationaldefensemagazine.com, January 29, 2014 The LaWS benefitted from commercial laser developments, with the system basically being six welding lasers \\"strapped together\\" that, although they don't become a single beam, all converge on the target at the same time. It generates 33 kW in testing, with follow-on deployable weapons generating 60‚Äì100 kW mounted on a Littoral Combat Ship or to destroy fast- attack boats, drones, manned aircraft, and anti-ship cruise missiles out to a few miles.Laser Weapons: Lower Expectations, Higher Threats ‚Äì Breakingdefense.com, May 19, 2014 In the short term, the LaWS will act as a short-range, self-defense system against drones and boats, while more powerful lasers in the future should have enough power to destroy anti-ship missiles; Navy slab lasers have been tested at 105 kW with increases to 300 kW planned. Laser weapons like the LaWS are meant to complement other missile and gun- based defense systems rather than replace them. While lasers are significantly cheaper and have virtually unlimited magazines, their beams can be disrupted by atmospheric and weather conditions (especially when operating at the ocean's surface) and are restricted to line-of-sight firing to continuously keep the beam on target. More conventional systems will remain in place for larger and longer-range targets that require the use of kinetic defense.Lasers Could Become Cost Effective Missile Defense Weapons ‚Äì Nationaldefensemagazine.org, August 2014 The LaWS control station aboard . Deployment The LaWS was deployed on Ponce in late August 2014 to the Persian Gulf with the U.S. 5th Fleet. The deployment is to test the feasibility of a laser weapon in a maritime environment against heat, humidity, dust, and salt water and to see how much power is used. The system has scalable power levels to be able to fire a non-lethal beam to dazzle a suspect vessel, and fire stronger beams to physically destroy a target; range is classified. Although neighboring Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz out of the Gulf using small boat swarms that the LaWS is able to counter, it was not designed or deployed specifically to be used against any one particular country.U.S. Navy Deploys Its First Laser Weapon in the Persian Gulf ‚Äì Bloomberg.com, November 14, 2014 In September 2014, the LaWS was declared an operational asset, so the ship commander has permission to use it for self-defense. Humans are not a target of the weapon under stipulations of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, but targets do include UAVs, helicopters, and fast patrol craft. Rules of engagement have been developed for its use, but details have not been released, although the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons Rules of Engagement (ROE) prohibit using laser weapons against humans. The Navy has released video of the LaWS on deployment disabling a ScanEagle UAV, detonating a rocket propelled grenade, and burning out the engine of a rigid hull inflatable boat. Officials said it is working beyond expectations. Compared to hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars for a missile, one laser shot costs only 59 cents. Composed of commercial laser components and proprietary Navy software, it is powered and cooled by a \\"skid\\" through a diesel generator, separate from the ship's electrical systems, giving greater efficiency relative to power provided of 35 percent. Mounted on Ponce's superstructure above the bridge, its powerful optics are also useful as a surveillance tool that can detect objects at unspecified but \\"tactically significant ranges\\"; sailors have equated its surveillance abilities to having the Hubble telescope at sea. Sailors are using it for targeting and training daily, whether to disable or destroy test targets or for potential target identification. The system is operated through a flat screen monitor and a gaming system-like controller integrated into the ship's combat system, so anyone with experience playing common video games can operate the weapon. It has functioned well against adverse weather, and is able to work in high humidity and after a dust storm. However, the system is not expected to work during harsh sandstorms and has not been tested in such conditions because \\"it didn't make much sense to\\", but threats would also not be expected to be operational under the same conditions. Deployments on other ships are being examined and although the LaWS was planned to remain deployed for one year,U.S. Navy Allowed to Use Persian Gulf Laser for Defense ‚Äì News.USNI.org, December 10, 2014Navy Declares Laser Weapons Ready to Protect Ships in Persian Gulf ‚Äì Military.com, December 10, 2014Navy's First Laser Gun Shines In Deployed Exercises ‚Äì Defensenews.com, December 11, 2014 it performed so well that fleet leadership decided to keep it on Ponce as long as it was at sea.Navy Pursuing Upgraded Railgun, Higher-Power Laser Gun By 2020 - News.USNI.org, 28 July 2015 Following a review of several ship classes to determine which had available space, power, and cooling, it was decided that after Ponce's planned decommissioning in 2018, the LaWS will be moved to the new amphibious transport dock ship for indefinite testing. It will utilise the space and power connections reserved for its vertical launching system to house the LaWS power and control modules while the laser itself will be bolted to the deck. Because the installation will be only a trial, LaWS will not be integrated into the ship's warfare system.LPD Portland Will Host ONR Laser Weapon Demonstrator, Serve as RIMPAC 2018 Flagship.

The title is a play on the common Tagalog profanity \\"putang ina\\", which roughly translates to \\"son of a bitch\\". Films Ang Tanging Ina (2003) With three dead husbands and twelve children to take care of, what is the modern day working mother supposed to do? Ina Montecillo (Ai-Ai delas Alas) is completely clueless on how to be an income provider and a homemaker at the same time given her dwindling finances of her household. As she desperately hides from her children her efforts to make all ends meet, her children grow resentful of her as she becomes a part of their own problems, but it seems that her best is never good enough. Funnily yet, Ina rallies her cause with all the courage she can muster- to be the best mother she knows how. Ang Tanging Ina N'yong Lahat (2008) With the one, big, happy family that she has, any woman would admire Ina Montecillo (Ai-Ai delas Alas) as the embodiment of a perfect mother. But after more than 30 years of doing everything for her family, she realizes she has not done anything for herself. Ina then embarks on a journey of finding her self-worth that surprisingly lands her as the President of the Philippines! Ina revolutionizes Philippine politics by running the country not as a serious and an uptight leader but as a hilarious and caring mother. Because of this, she gained the trust and the support of the Filipino people. But just as she starts to become the president that everyone loves, she also changes and becomes the mother that her children hate. In the end, Ina has to make the hardest choice of her life ‚Äì becoming the mother of the nation or becoming the mother of her own children. Ang Tanging Ina Mo (Last na 'To!)

She was launched on 21 March 2014 and entered service in mid-February 2015, replacing both the former vessel, 1995-built and a chartered freight vessel (latterly ). History Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown MSP announced on 8 June 2012 there was to be a replacement vessel for the Stornoway-Ullapool route. Two weeks later on 22 June, Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited announced that the contract to construct had been signed with Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft MBH and Co KG in Germany. Construction commenced on 16 September 2013 with the cutting of the first steel. The shed at the Flensburger shipyard suffered damage in the St. Jude storm, delaying delivery by about two weeks. The building of the ferry was financed by the Lloyds Banking Group who then leased Loch Seaforth to Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) who in turn chartered her to the operator, CalMac. Ownership remained with Lloyds until 10 October 2019, when CMAL purchased Loch Seaforth outright, ending the lease after almost five years. The name was chosen in a competition run by CMAL, reviving that of MacBrayne's 1947 Stornoway mailboat. Before launch, there was speculation over the timetables for the new vessel. Despite being capable of 24-hour operation, there were concerns that she would not carry out 24-hour sailings in summer. Loch Seaforth was launched on 21 March 2014 and christened by Joan Murray, the eldest daughter of the late Captain John Smith, master of the original 1947 mailboat. She departed Germany on her delivery voyage on 4 November 2014 and arrived in Greenock three days later. After sea trials, she was laid up as the piers at Stornoway and Ullapool were unfinished. Loch Seaforth sailed to Ullapool on 12 November 2014, to conduct berthing trials, which were successful and returned to the Clyde. On 6 December 2014, she sailed to carry out crew familiarisation tests at Stornoway, despite the terminal not being ready to accommodate her. Once again, she returned to the Clyde. Loch Seaforth undertook berthing trials at the new pier at Stornoway on 4 February 2015. Her first commercial sailing was the overnight freight sailing on 10/11 February. An open day for public viewing was held in Stornoway on 13 February, and she gave her first passenger crossing of the Minch the following day. She entered public service on 16 February, initially on a 'phasing-in' basis, but full- time, effectively relieving Isle of Lewis, which was delayed in leaving drydock in Birkenhead during her annual overhaul. On 5 March, Loch Seaforth developed a ventilation fan problem at Ullapool, leaving the Isle of Lewis to take passengers and their vehicles to Stornoway, putting her new backup status to the test. The Ullapool port reopened in May 2015 with a new linkspan. Loch Seaforth was finally able to take up her full round-the-clock schedule between Stornoway and Ullapool. Chartered freight vessel, left Stornoway for Heysham after staying in reserve for any teething troubles. remained as a backup vessel on the route until the summer of 2015, undertaking extra sailings on Fridays and Saturdays during the summer of 2015 to cope with demand. Layout MV Loch Seaforth is of ro-ro design with bow and stern ramps. She has \\"clam shell\\" bow doors that open sideways. The car deck provides 376 lane- metres and is partially open at the stern. Car capacity is augmented by two hoistable mezzanine decks. Five stairways and two passenger lifts give access to the main passenger accommodation on Deck 5. This includes a Quiet Lounge, a shop, a Coffee Cabin, a play area and a gaming area. Towards the bow is a cafeteria, with an observation lounge looking forwards, on the deck above. There is outside seating towards the stern on decks 6 and 7. The combination of diesel electrical and diesel mechanical propulsion give a high level of redundancy. The two W√§rtsil√§ 8L 32 main engines can use IFO 40 and MDO fuel oils. Three backup diesel generators would allow her to operate to timetable even with one main engine out of service. Service MV Loch Seaforth is operated by Caledonian MacBrayne on the Stornoway to Ullapool route. She provides passenger sailings through the day and an overnight freight service.

The Patan Museum was inaugurated in 1997 by Late King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah. The Patan Museum displays the traditional sacred arts of Nepal in an illustrious architectural setting. Its home is an old residential court of Patan Durbar, one of the royal palaces of former Malla Kings of the Kathmandu Valley. The royal palace was built in 1734, on the site of a Buddhist monastery. The museum quadrangle is known as Keshav Narayan Chowk. The Museum's exhibits cover a long span of Nepal's cultural history and some rare objects are among its treasures. Most of the objects are cast bronzes (mostly sculptures of Hindu and Buddhist deities) and gilt copper repouss√© work, traditional crafts for which Patan is famous. The Museum has over 1,100 artifacts, about 200 of which are on permanent exhibition. Patan Durbar Square was heavily damaged by the earthquake in April 2015. The entrance fees are 1000 Nepalese rupees for foreign visitors, 250 for SAARC visitors, 30 for Nepali visitors, and 15 for Nepalese students (with identification).

There are more than 136 archaeological sites in the territory of ancient Kapilavastu. TilaurƒÅko·π≠, Niglihawa, Gotihawa, Arorakot, Sisahaniyakot, Chhetradehi, Sagrahawa, Pipari etc. are enriched with ancient art remains and monuments. Archaeological findings of TilaurƒÅko·π≠ and of other sites are kept in Kapilavastu museum. This museum is operated under the Department of Archaeology of NepƒÅl Government. This museum was established in 1962 located on the right bank of Banaganga river and western site of TilaurƒÅko·π≠ mound. There are terracotta human figurines, animal figurines, bird, seal and sealing, beads, bangles, dabber, flesh rubber, coins, musical instruments, chalcolithic objects of Mustang Chhokhopani cave. Copper rings, weapons, painted grey ware pieces, conch and bone balls, teeth of hair, shoulder bone, finger bone and leg bone are also displayed here :  Pottery  Pottery from the excavated and explored‚Äìsites help us in understanding basic cultural components of the various periods of human occupation. In course of excavation at TilaurƒÅko·π≠, Ba√±jarƒÅhƒ´, Lumbinƒ´, RƒÅmagrƒÅma and PaisiƒÅ, excavators discovered clear-cut sequences of cultures beginning from painted grey ware phase to the period of Imperial Guptas. Some of the ancient mounds yielded fragments of P.G. ware, N.B.P. ware and Red ware from the surface. Vedmau is specially enriched with the fragments of painted grey ware, which is called a Vedic site by the local people. The ceramic tradition of this region is similar to the one at HastinƒÅpur from period II to IV. Thus, the archaeologists rightly compared the chronology and ceramic tradition of the area with that of HastinƒÅpur. The most characteristic shape in grey ware is dish with convex sides and beaked edges. The pottery is thick in section having horizontal and vertical bands. The clay used was well- levigated. A metallic sound is produced by the fragments of grey ware when struck. Northern black polished ware is thin and perfect in treatment. The clay used is not so well levigated and well-baked as in the case of Grey Ware. It carries black and silver shades. These two phases are comparable to the periods II and III of HastinƒÅpur, dated there in c.11-8th and c.6th-5th centuries BC respectively. The red‚Äìslipped ware is abundant in quantity in the trenches as well as on the surface of the ancient mounds. Dishes, bowls and basins are representative types of this ceramic tradation as well. Red ware pottery and terracotta seals with BrƒÅhmi scripts were found in the same layers. The quality of clay is very fine and is also well-fired.  Painted Grey Ware  The P.G. ware are thicker in section and decorated with horizontal or vertical bands, criss-cross bands and irregular dots over the grey surface with black pigments. Some of them are plain having shining on surface. Northern Black Polished Ware North black polished ware was popular throughout the western Terai region of NepƒÅl succeeding the painted Grey ware. The treatment and finish of the ware looks perfect. The surface is usually coal-black and rarely steel- grey or silvery. In some cases it has golden- brown patches. The core is either grey or redish. The part immediately below the surface is generally dull-red. NBP ware fragments are thin and well-baked and are made of good quality of clay. This region is completely dominated by the N.B.P ware, rather than the black polished ware, as is seen in the eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh in India. Fragments of black-polished ware are thinner in section and are not as perfect in treatment as NBP ware. Fragments of this ware are similar to that of the pottery of period III at HastinƒÅpur. It is datable in c.6th-5th centuries B.C. Dishes, bowls, saucers, small basins, lids with tapering sides, small vases with different types of rim and carinated handis are the representative types in this ceramic. There are deep or shallow bowls with convex, receding or progressively widening sides, small basins with receding sides, lids with tapering sides, some with a projection for flanged vessels and small vases with different types of rims. Red ware This type of ceramic is usually associated with the Mauryan Period. Some of the fragments in red ware are painted in circular line. In some cases, the black portion is so well merged with the red that it is difficult to find out the main feature. Mainly bowls, basins and vases are reported. However, these shapes are not peculiar to this type alone. It is usually of medium fabric with some red-slip on it. It is found at Ba√±jarƒÅhƒ´, TilaurƒÅko·π≠ and Go·π≠ihawƒÅ during excavations. From period I A at Ba√±jarƒÅhƒ´, smooth and heavy red wares with black-wash, heavy unslipped red ware with and coarse red ware are reported. Smooth and heavy red ware with black-wash is wheel‚Äìturned and is not well fired. It has several shapes, viz. lid, bowls, shallow plate, pot with elongated body, basins and convex-sided pots. Rimless bowls are with either straight or slightly convex sides and pointed edge. A single fragment of the small bowl is thick-sided with bevelled-in edge. Dishes are convex-sided with slightly clubbed out edge or pointed edge. Basins are also with beaked-in edge. Heavy red ware with unslipped and roughened surface has a gritty core. All shapes are mostly utilitarian, viz. pots with high and straight or flared mouth and globular pots. Vessels representing coarse red ware type were meant for everyday use, viz. pots with constricted necks and basins. Red-slipped ware Red-slipped ware represents identical types in several shapes. The simultaneous use of this ware and grey ware copiously for utensils of daily use in hundreds of contemporaneous sites of Northern India and the western Terai region of NepƒÅl suggest that both were manufactured in the immediate vicinity of the sites. These wares represent the particular significance of its utility as well as its social significance in the contemporary society. This ware is reported from various mounds in the region. Stratified specimens are reported from Ba√±jarƒÅhƒ´ and TilaurƒÅko·π≠. From period I A at Ba√±jarƒÅhƒ´ the red-slipped ware has red core with bright red-slip on it. It is made of purer clay. There is a fragment of a high-necked pot with flared ends. The other fragment of a basin with a red wash on its surface and having convex-sides and beaded out rim is also reported from this site. Late Grey Ware The ceramic industry of late grey ware is distinguished by the mode of its firing. It has a medium-thick section like the one from period III. It is particularly characteristic pottery of period IV of HastinƒÅpur, where it is called late grey ware. The red and grey wares were manufactured in contemporaneous sites of Northern India and NepƒÅlese Terai. Its core is generally ashy-grey and rarely blackish-grey. Most of the vessels were treated with a slip both internally and externally. The colour was either grey with shades varying from medium to dark grey or black. Some of the sherds bear bands, dots and strokes in black. Dishes, bowls and dining‚Äìplates are representative types in this ceramic. Bowls in this ware are as frequent as in the red ware and represent a wide variety of types. Mitra has recorded various types of this ware from TilaurƒÅko·π≠. According to her these indifferently-painted pots found in association with the Northern Black Polished Ware cannot be assigned to a distinctly pre-NBP ware Phase. One has to carefully examine to determine the original colour of her findings because other excavators have discovered painted grey ware in course of excavation at the same mound, assignable to period II at HastinƒÅpur. Chocolate-slipped Ware The slip on the chocolate- slipped ware is of a better standard than the red-slipped ware. First of all this ware was discovered from period II at Ba√±jarƒÅhƒ´. It shows a reddish core with degraissant in the form of pieces of hay and fine sand. The original surface was brown-red on which chocolate slip was coated. Fragment of a vessel with flared mouth internally carinated has also been found at the former site. It has a beaked edge Black-slipped Ware Being black-slipped or black polished its polish and shine is not of perfect quality like that of the Northern black polished ware. Its colour seems to be greyish and not deep black. Dishes and bowls are representative types of this ceramic. Layers 1-4 at TilaurƒÅko·π≠ yielded mainly red wares and the black-slipped grey ware of a coarse variety. Period IV of this site is related to the Su·πÖga and the first phase of the KushƒÅ·πáa periods. Period V, consisting of Layers 1-3, has also mainly yielded red ware and black-slipped grey ware of a coarse variety at TilaurƒÅko·π≠. Mauryan Figurines A number of Mauryan figurines have been reported from TilaurƒÅko·π≠. They are quite large and are characterised by smooth and sensitive modelling though only the face was moulded and the rest the body was hand- made. Decorations were done with suitable clay bands made separately and added later over the body. Sometimes wooden pins have been used to decorate the body. The figurines have big eyes, prominent nose, slit mouth and incised lines to mark hair. They are either red or of smoky colours and are made of fine levigated clay. The ears are separately made with heavy lump of clay shaped like ears with pendent and applied over it. The left one is missing. Roundish face is worn out, however, it carries a dignified expression. There are big circular earring and a flat band of a necklace. It belongs to the third century B.C. Such figures from North-India are dated in pre-Mauryan period by Coomarswamy, Zimmer, and Rowland. The other handsome figure from TilaurƒÅko·π≠ also represents the bust of a female. The face is ovalish and bicornate headdress up to the shoulder is shown on it. The figure wears heavy earrings and triple flat band necklace, and, nose, eyes, mouth and nostril are indicated by incised lines and puncture. Rijal dates these two figurines pre- Mauryan period. However, style and technique of the figure undoubtedly place it in the Mauryan period. The latter figurine is illustrated in the text published by Rissho University Japan. Su·πÖga Figurines The Mauryan and the Su·πÖga art do not appear to have any relation with each other so far as stone sculptures are concerned. However, in terracotta art there appears to be some relationships between the two. There was a sudden increase in the manufacture of terracotta art due to an important change in the technique and tradition of its production. Modeling was given up during this period. It was replaced by the mould technique, which was extensively used for the depiction of a variety of subjects. This change of technique was probably due to heavy demand for terracotta art in contemporary society. Stone was a hard and scarce material. So, it was not a convenient medium for mass production. It was not available in plenty in most regions. Due to its dexterous quality, it could not be easily converted into figurines or plaques. However, it was easy to display sensitive features of body in clay by subtle modeling. The plaques were produced from a single mould, and are, therefore, entirely flat without any decoration at the back. Some are produced in low flattened relief, while others come out with the background in fairly high relief. Some plaques are provided with holes at the top for hanging on the wall. In course of time, the Su·πÖga artist produced fine pieces modeled in bold relief displaying disciplined sensitive modeling. They are of extremely fine fabric and are uniformly baked. They have light darkish red colour, though some of them do have a red-slip on them. They have an elaborate headdress, beaded bands on the head, studs or discs shaped earrings in their ears and with elaborate flat necklaces. Apart from these, they are heavily decorated with bangles anklets armlets and broad bejewelled girdles on the waist. As a rule, the figures have heavy coiffure and wear elaborate apparel and jewellery concealing, to a certain extent, the beauty of the delicately-modelled body. The female wears an extremely elaborate headdress and is loaded with jewellery, while the male wears a turban round his head. The plaques have decorative borders and the background is stamped with floral and rosette pattern. The treatment of the drapery is also varied. KushƒÅ·πáa Figurines A large number of big-size male and female heads, busts and figures which usually betray crude workmanship have been found at different sites, specially from TilaurƒÅko·π≠, Piprƒ´, Lumbinƒ´ and SisahaniyƒÅ-Pandey. The specimens reflect that the artist did not use the mould, which was so commonly employed by the Su·πÖga artists. In some cases a mould was occasionally used, particularly for producing large figures of which the busts were hand modelled and only the heads were pressed out of moulds. The inferior quality of clay, mixed with grit, husk and other impurities have been used to execute these KushƒÅ·πáa figurines. The eyes and mouth are wide open and the nose is long, pinched out by hand. The workmanship of this group is poorer than other Su·πÖga figurines found at the site. The return of modeling forms does not seem to have been successful. According to Agrawal available specimens from the datable layers at Ahichchhatra are of crude workmanship, showing neglect in the use of mould and a reversal to hand-made form. A large quantity of the figurines made in same tradition of manufacturing is found in this region. Deterioration in terracotta figurines may have been due to the mass production of stone sculptures in contemporary society. Eyes, mouth and nose are made with either incised lines or punched-dots made with the help of bamboo or wooden pins. The female figurines have been bedecked with heavy ornaments, especially earrings, necklaces and fan‚Äìlike headgear. Mishra has classified these specimens into three groups: round and carved up to the feet, figures with oil lamps and Negam type. However, his classification is not attested in this region probably due to lack of sufficient specimens. These are classified into four groups on the basis of fragments and models available in this area. Terracotta Figurines Terracotta, being a cheap and most popular medium and within the reach of poor and common man, has been used not only as the medium for artistic expression but also for personal ornaments like beads, bangles and rings, seal and sealing, children's toys and objects of domestic and ritualistic needs. A large number of terracotta animals and bird figurines were undoubtedly children's toys. Terracotta plaques with holes at the top were suspended against the walls. Some of them were kept as decorating objects on the mantel-pieces or niches made on or in the walls of the houses. Flat, rectangular, oval or round plaques could be made out of clay without any difficult. Being a cheap and tractable medium it was highly demanded in contemporary society. It is largely concerned itself with the representation of the scenes of everyday life, and, as such, its social imports appear to be immense. Terracotta, in its varied uses and applications, gives us an idea for constructing the social, cultural, political and religious life of the contemporary people. Terracotta human and animal figurines give us a clear picture of the life-ways during the ancient period. Increase in communication between Northern-India and the western Terai region of NepƒÅl resulted in the introduction of many classical elements of Indian art, the pattern of NepƒÅlese culture and art tradition. Terracotta figurines from TilaurƒÅko·π≠, Lumbinƒ´, KudƒÅn, Ba√±jarƒÅhi, Pipr·øë, KadzahawƒÅ etc. have brought to light a large variety of terracotta remains, which throw considerable light on the trends of plastic art and nature of NepƒÅli artists during the pre-Christian and early Christian centuries. TilaurƒÅko·π≠ may be called a mine of such objects as it has yielded a very large number of terracotta human and animal figurines by which it is called a mine. So far as the dating of the human figurines are concerned, scholars generally believe that hand‚Äìmade figurines were made earlier than those produced with the help of a mould. But this common belief does not find any favor in this region because practice of both modelling and moulding went hand in hand at one and the same time in some cases. However, many of the significant terracotta figurines, relevant for a study of this art, are simply accidental finds and no accurate data with regard to the level of their discovery are available. These specimens seem to have been disturbed from their original level due to some actions of men or of nature. Some terracotta figurines of different dates have been discovered in the same Pit. In the study of the terracotta art of this region special attention has been taken to spell out its date, even if it could be ascribed to a particular piece on the basis of its context. Many of the excavating teams have not published their detailed excavation reports. In such cases, only illustrations and brief out lines are given in this study. Terracotta figurines have been classified on the basis of the variations in use, style, model, shape and types. Human Figurines Both human and divine figurines reflect not only the socio‚Äìcultural, economic and religious modes and thoughts of a community, but also delineate its artistic tradition. In the primitive stage of human civilization many symbols as well as anthropomorphic forms had been used to express human emotions and spiritual feelings e.g. snake and mother goddess associated with the ritual of fertility or agriculture, a phenomenon common to all cultures. In the study of human figurines many specimens as well as fragments are included which were found in course of excavation, especially from TilaurƒÅko·π≠. These figurines hardly reflect any characteristics peculiar to this region alone. Bearing the impress of the trends, tastes and fashions of the artistic movements of the Mauryan, Su·πÖga and KushƒÅ·πáa periods, most of them throw light on the common features of the contemporary terracotta art‚Äìtradition of northern and eastern India. Latter among them were intended for house‚Äìdecoration, a presumption substantiated by the suspension holes made in plaques found here. The study of terracotta of the region leads one to divide them into two groups‚Äìone indicating a primitive form and experience and the other showing the impress and formulations of a stylistic advance natural to a progressive art movement in a chronological sequence. In form and technique, the former differs from the latter and the primitive type is also being fashioned out by the rural people even in the present day. Scholars have described these types as \\"ageless\\" in distinction to the second, which is designated as terracotta figurines with the \\"time variation \\". The ageless type is characterized by a modeling that reduces the form to a simple description of the main volumes of the figures corresponding to the principal parts of the body. These are fashioned entirely by hand by means of such rough and ready Devices as modeling the body, pinching up and pressing down soft clay according to the requirements of the forms. Eyes, lips, ears, navel, hair etc. are indicated either by incisions or by strips and pellets separately fashioned and applied on the modeled form. The applique technique is also adapted for delineating ornaments and headdresses. The human figurines of these groups have been reported form TilaurƒÅko·π≠ area. Mitra has reported such an ageless type figurine, which was purely hand‚Äìmodelled and crudely fashioned, from the rampart filling at TilaurƒÅko·π≠. Animal Figurines The terracotta animal figurines were produced in greater number than other figurines. A large number of terracotta animal and bird figurines were meant undoubtedly to be children's toys. Some of them might have been made by the family members of the artists. Toys were quite popular in this area during ancient period. As recorded in BhaddasƒÅla JƒÅtaka prince Vidudabha questions his mother as to why he does not get gifts like horses, elephants and toys which other princes were receiving from their maternal side. Among animal figurines, elephant, bull, horse, ram, dog, deer and birds are found in larger proportion. Crude animal figurines when decorated become more realistic and beautiful. The artists show a preference for elephant. Animals are made of baked clay. One of them recovered from the excavation at TilaurƒÅko·π≠ seems to be carefully modeled by hand, possessing a solid body. Its ears and nostrils are marked by simple depressions. In making animal figurines, pinholes or the applique pellets also serve the purpose of eyes. Anatomical details such as legs, trunk, tail etc. have been realistically delineated in some examples. The first type of figurine is generally well-modeled and the favorite device of decorating the body of elephants was to cover them with circlets which were punched, stamped, pierced or notched. However, in still more artistic figurines they stamped elegant chakras and leaves on the body and temples of the elephants. The second type of figurines, particularly the bulls, reflects skill and imagination in their modeling. The nostrils and the mouth are clearly marked by punctured dots and oblong incisions respectively. They are stamped with solar symbols, eight‚Äìspoked symbols and four-spoked wheels. The third type of figurines, especially, horses present a longish neck sometimes with beaked faces. The eyes are diamond-shaped with a punctured dot or dash for pupils. Other specimens, viz. dog, deer, ram, birds, are also modeled or moulded in usual tradition and technique in the contemporary society. All the specimens are made of fine-grained clay. They are usually red in colour and fairly well-burnt, often with a grey core. Grey specimens and a few of smoky- red figurines are treated with black slip. The terracotta figurines are classified into seven groups on the basis of the form of animals. The bull figurine seems to be ubiquitous in all cultural traditions, symbolizing as it did strength, virility and agricultural productivity. N.B.P ware Phase is marked by a dominance of bull figurine among other animal figurines.

Staccato guitars  Pat Townshend designed the magnesium alloy guitar called, \\"The Staccato.\\" The final guitar design featured a neck and bridge system that could be swapped out. The user could interchange a bass neck for a six string neck. Some models featured no volume or tone pots. The user could activate the volume controls on a touch sensitive LED pad. Staccato guitars were conceived in 1978 the first was cast in aluminium, all guitars after 001 were cast in magnesium alloy. At the time both Travis Bean and Kramer guitars were also cast in aluminium, Staccato was the first and only production magnesium guitars made to this day. The first 21 guitars made by staccato were interchangeable neck models. The neck section could be replaced in a second with alternatives of 6 string, 12 string or bass guitar. again a unique concept, doing away with the need for a heavy cumbersome double neck guitar. The prototype was cast in Los Angeles and machined in John Carvthers guitar shop in Santa Monica. Pat did the final build, assembly and paint job at his home in Topanga Canyon, California. The prototype bass was built in Norfolk, England in 1983 by Townshend who had a business partnership with Chris Jagger in the mid 1980s. There was a limited production run of Staccato guitars, produced at the old school house in Woodbastwick, Norfolk. The partners on equal shares were Pat Townshend, Bill Wyman, Chris and Mick Jagger. This was something of a milestone in British music history for a musical instrument to be financially backed by members of the greatest rock 'n' roll band in the world the Rolling stones. The M.G. model was launched in 1985, this was along more conventional lines with fixed neck (not interchangeable) but retaining the cast magnesium alloy though neck, precision right hand turning system and fibreglass body. Just over 200 of the M.G. models were built with the production ending in 1987 after Pat resigned from the company. Gene Simmons can be seen playing a Staccato bass during Kiss' Crazy Nights World Tour.  Staccato drums  Staccato drums designed by Pat Townshend first appeared in 1977. They were said to work on something called the ‚Äúkadency‚Äù principle, in which ‚Äúa volume of air projected through a controlled expanding space will have a great effect on tonal resonance, distribution and power.‚Äù In drummers‚Äô terms, what they were truthfully saying was this gave clarity with loads and loads of volume. To make this happen, Staccato's shells were quite thin, but were stronger than steel, being made from FRP (fibreglass reinforced polyester resin). But their real acoustic strength lay in the fact that the notched horns made them sound deep even though their heads were tight. The company claimed there was actually a difference of one octave between the head and the mouth of the drum, which was useful for recording because it offered many more miking options. The shape of this mouth was constant for all the drums, although its size was not. The bass drum was even more distinctive, with two ray-shaped mouths known to Staccato as Siamese Twins, but to the rest of the world as ‚Äúelephant‚Äôs trousers.‚Äù They were designed to work like those old public-address systems you once saw at sports grounds, with two trumpets for spread, sharing a single diaphragm. They remain the most unusual and powerful in the world, possibly the most talked-about drum kit on the Internet. The stunning visual appearance and the thunderous sound of Staccato drums has drawn film, video and television producers. they have appeared in the fourth movie, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Robbie Williams Video, \\"let me entertain you\\" 1999, Robbie Coltrane ‚Äì (The history of rock) channel 4 mid 1990s, Super Furry Animals ‚Äì Top of the pops, August 2005. orange and black (vintage) Staccato kit, Glam metal detectives(BBC 2 series) mid 1990s.

The formation mainly consisted of Red Guard troops from Petrograd and Moscow under the command of Vladimir Antonov- Ovseyenko and Mikhail Muravyov as the chief of staff. The group consisted of some 20,000 troops. Historical background The group started to arrive in Kharkiv on December 21, 1917, and on December 22-23, 1917, with the help of the local squads of Red Guards, it established Soviet power in the city. On December 24-25, 1917 in Kharkiv the First All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets, which proclaimed the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets, took place. The group included the squads of Rudolf Sivers, Yuriy Sablin, Pavel Yegorov, Grigory Petrov, and others, as well as the local squads of Red Guards. In the beginning of January 1918, without any official declaration of war, the group initiated military actions around Kharkiv (Lozova, Synelnykove, Pavlohrad, Sloviansk). By that time the Soviet government of Russia had concluded a provisional armistice agreement with the Central Powers, seeking to end its participation in World War I (see Treaty of Brest-Litovsk). On January 2, 1918 Sovnarkom appointed Sergo Ordzhonikidze the provisional extraordinary commissar of the Ukrainian region, who arrived in Kharkiv on January 8. In January 1918, under the pretense of helping the Bolsheviks of Ukraine in establishing Soviet power, the group launched an offensive from multiple directions (Kharkiv and Katerynoslav, Bryansk, Homel) against Kiev. A cover for military actions against the Ukrainian People's Republic was a call of the People's Secretariat to an armed struggle against the \\"counter-revolutionary\\" Central Council of Ukraine. The command of the offensive was handed to the acting People's Commissar Yuri Kotsiubynsky (acting for Vasyl Shakhrai). On February 8, 1918 the group occupied Kiev and the government of Ukraine relocated to Zhytomyr. On February 9, 1918 it signed a military protection pact with the Central Powers (see Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine‚ÄìCentral Powers)). In the east the group managed to occupy the Donets basin and the territory of the Don Host Oblast, ending the authority of General Alexey Kaledin. In the occupied territories such political formations as the Don Soviet Republic and the Donetsk-Krivoi Rog Soviet Republic were established. Kiev Offensive On January 15, 1918 the formation occupied Oleksandrivsk (Zaporizhia), and on January 21, 1918 Kharkiv received a message from Katerynoslav: \\"Pass this on to the Red Guard headquarters. We attacked Poltava ... the station is occupied, there is fighting in the city. Send urgently to Konstantinograd (Krasnohrad) 1000 Red Guards to connect with Yegorov\\". The Moscow Red Guard squads led by Yegorov, while traveling from the Lozova Rail Station, intercepted a heavy siege battery of the opponent that was sent to Poltava from Novocherkassk. At the same time Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko reported to the Narkom of Military Affairs (Soviet Russia): \\"Yesterday in the evening Poltava was occupied by us through an offensive from Lozova and Kharkiv... [We are] anticipating a report about the occupation of Bakhmach\\". On January 28 the 1st Minsk Revolutionary Troops, led by Reingold Berzin, occupied Bakhmach. Bƒìrzi≈Ü≈°'s unit consisted of 3,500 Red Guards and soldiers, four artillery batteries, and an armored train (Putilov plant) with a team of 77 people and 16 machine guns. The same day, the revolutionary forces met some resistance at the Kruty Rail Station, where they were held off for another day by a few hundred cadets. Another commander of the Moscow Red Guards was Andrei Znamensky, who led the special assignment unit of Blagushe-Lefortovo. At the Extraordinary All-Russian Railway Congress on January 26, 1918, Lenin stated that the Rada was \\"living out its last days\\". On January 29 in Kiev an uprising of workers started at the Arsenal city factory. To their help rushed the squads of P. Yegorov, G. Kudinsky, Vitaliy Primakov, Reingold Berzin and others. In the fierce fighting on the outskirts of Kiev and in the city, artillery and armored trains were widely used. On February 6, 1918 the command of the Soviet forces reported back to Lenin in Petrograd that street fighting was taking place in Kiev and the Red Guards were suffering great losses. And it further stated: \\"We have cleared all the stations in Kiev, as well as the Rail Terminal. Armored trains of the latest technology are pushing out the enemy from the city center. Our artillery is shelling the city day and night. Request urgently that 1,000 Red Guards be sent.\\" But no reinforcements were really needed, as the Ukrainian forces withdrew from the city. On February 8, 1918 Kiev finally became Soviet. With the situation in Ukraine and the Lower Don river region secured, the group of forces was redirected to the South Ural region against General Alexander Dutov and then J√≥zef Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki in the eastern regions of Belarus.

Built of brick in 1827, it is the oldest standing public brick building in Hancock County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Brick School House is a single story brick structure, with a hip roof and a granite foundation. It is set facing south on the east side of Maine State Route 179, about south of its junction with Maine State Route 9. It is roughly square in shape, with three windows on its west face, none on its east face, two on the north face, and two (along with the door) on the south face. The door, believed to be original, is board-and-batten. A brick chimney rises on the north side. The interior is simply finished, with wainscoted walls. The town of Aurora was settled in 1808, and had by 1820 built its first schoolhouse. It authorized construction of this building in 1827. The use of brick in its construction is unusual, given the wide availability and use of wood as a building material in a community with a timber-based economy. It is believed that the impetus for using brick came from Samuel Silsby, the town's first settler, who was educated in a brick schoolhouse in Connecticut. The building was well ahead of its time in terms of standards, exceeding those established by the state twenty years later. It was used as a school until 1918, and has also been used as a town hall. It was rehabilitated in the 1950s. In 1982, voters at a town meeting authorized the town selectman to seek a community development block grant to fix the Brick School House while authorizing a $750 expenditure from the town as well. The objective was to convert the building for use as a public library.

These early Malay newspapers were mostly run by Indo men ‚Äì Eurasians of mixed Dutch and native ancestry ‚Äì and located in major trade cities. Pembrita Betawi, located in the colonial capital at Batavia (now Jakarta), was no exception. The first edition of Pembrita Betawi was published on 24 December 1884. The newspaper was published daily, except on Sundays and holidays, with the Indo journalist J. Kieffer as editor-in-chief and possibly with funds from W. Meulenhoff, a journalist who had previously worked with Kieffer. The newspaper was printed by W. Bruining Co. and distributed throughout Batavia. Kieffer had previously headed several newspapers, including Bintang Barat and Bintang Betawi, although none of them had been long-lasting. The newspaper consisted of four pages, two for news and two for advertisements. To help promote the newspaper, Kieffer held a raffle for all readers willing to subscribe to a full year. By 8 June 1885 the newspaper was owned entirely by Meulenhoff; Kieffer had left Pembrita Betawi by that time. Meulenhoff changed the newspaper's printing press to Albrecht Co., also in Batavia. The following year Meulenhoff brought on Lie Kim Hok, a peranakan Chinese writer and teacher, as a business partner; Meulenhoff was one of several Dutch and Indo newspaper heads who brought in Chinese partners during this period. With 1,000 gulden Lie bought half of the shares in the company. Printing rights were soon acquired by Lie's Bogor-based printing house, also named Lie Kim Hok, and the first edition under this leadership was published on 1 June 1886. Lie and Meulenhoff worked on the newspaper together, dividing administrative and editorial duties between them, and his printing press was moved to Batavia. On 2 June 1887 it was announced that Pembrita Betawi had been sold to Karsseboom & Co. Meulenhoff was retained as editor-in-chief. Lie Kim Hok's printing press was retained for several months, before the press ‚Äì including its stock and printing rights for Pembrita Betawi ‚Äì was sold to Albrecht. Lie had no involvement with the newspaper afterwards, and Albrecht continued to print Pembrita Betawi until the newspaper was shut down in 1916; native-owned newspapers had become more common in the early 1910s, leading to a reduction in Pembrita Betawi circulation. Contents Dutch-language ad for Pembrita Betawi, 1884 Pembrita Betawi contained a variety of contents, including news, writings on entertainment and polemics. In the early years after its establishment, the newspaper focused on news relating to the Indies, with a special section for topics of interest to Chinese Indonesians. Around 1907 Pembrita Betawi began publishing news related to native ethnic groups, who were becoming increasingly literate through the Dutch Ethical Policy which, among other things, promoted education for non-Europeans. Writing under the pen name Kalam Langit, the ethnic-Chinese writer Na Tian Piet wrote extensively about Singapore. Editorials published between 1901 and 1903 in the column Dreyfusiana (a reference to the then-ongoing Dreyfus affair in France) and written by Tirto Adhi Soerjo, a young Javanese journalist, contained scathing criticism of the Dutch colonial government and perceived misuses of power. Stage dramas, including bangsawan troupes, received extensive coverage in Pembrita Betawi. The newspaper's staff wrote positively about various troupes and published casting calls for them. Meanwhile, letters from readers about the theatre ‚Äì including complaints of oversexuality unfitting for young women ‚Äì were published.

History First published on 28 February 1888, The Barrier Miner was published continuously until 25 November 1974. Copies are available on microfilm and online via Trove Digitised Newspapers. The paper was revived briefly in 2005; an index to births deaths and marriages has been prepared which also notes additional publication dates between 16 December 2005 and 31 July 2008. The paper closed down for a second time in 2008 with the managing director, Margaret McBride stating that \\"...due to commercial reasons the paper would no longer service Broken Hill and the region...\\". The Barrier Miner served the growing mining community of Broken Hill, when the area was found to have lead ore and traces of silver. It was not until late 1884 or early 1885 that rich quantities of silver were found and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP) was floated to mine the leases. The newspaper was published by Henry Fenton, Augustus Sydney Knight and George Alfred Mills and was distributed to Broken Hill, Tibooburra, White Cliffs, Wilcannia, Menindee, Ivanhoe. It was edited by Samuel Prior from 1888, who was also a partner (with a one-seventh share) with the main proprietors in 1905, Knight and Von Rieben Ltd. who took over in about 1890 when Fenton and Mills sold their interests. Prior may have been one of the youngest editors of a daily newspaper in Australia. He later wrote the Wild Cats column at The Bulletin, where he was later appointed editor, and was its main proprietor when he died in 1933. E. R. Kellsall took over as editor after Prior left, with Mr R.D.S. Magnusson as sub-editor. The newspaper was originally published and printed from a building in Argent Street, occupying a galvanised iron clad shed. In 1908 a substantial stone building was erected by F.J. Fairweather and Sons on the corner of Blende and Sulphide Streets. Knight and Von Rieben retired in 1907 to Adelaide and Sydney respectively, when John Smethurst (a building contractor who erected the Broken Hill Town Hall) took over as managing editor, remained in charge up to 1933 when J. F. Williams took over. E. K. Lean, joined the staff in 1893 and became assistant manager in 1918. A Sunday evening special edition was published during the 1914-1918 war featuring letters from overseas soldiers with many eager residents rushing the office for copies as soon as they came off the presses. The newspaper office was twice bombed during World War I, it is believed because of some comments made about unpatriotic behaviour in the town, which was not taken well by the strong unionised workforce. Daily circulation reached 8303 in 1905, with three editions published up to about 1922 (at 1 p.m., 3:00-3:30 p.m. and 6:00-6:30 p.m.) the first and third editions being sold in Argent Street and the second edition being home delivered. James Davison (1848-1929) (managing editor of the Melbourne Herald) took over the paper in 1919, along with the Port Pirie Recorder. He left in 1922 to start the Adelaide News (the paper that gave Murdoch's News Limited its start). Competition came in 1919 with the addition of the Barrier Daily Truth. Digitisation The paper has been digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program project of the National Library of Australia. The microfilm copies are held in the collection of the State Library of New South Wales.

She is currently based in Africa. Biography Zohra Bensemra was born in Algiers, Algeria, in October 1968. She grew up seeing her older brother take amateur pictures. Around the age of six, she started imitating him and taking his cameras when he was not at home. One day her brother found out what she had been doing and screamed at her, but later got her a small camera for herself and she started by taking pictures of her classmates. Bensemra has worked as a photojournalist since 1990. She stated in her Reuters profile that she first felt like a photographer in 1995: the first time she ever saw dead bodies in her life. There had been a car bombing in the center of Algerian capital, close to the police station and her workplace. The first thing she saw was the body of a burnt woman on the ground. The next day she woke up and felt the calling to become a real photographer. She firmly believes that in order to succeed, especially in jobs like photojournalism, one has to learn to accept the challenges that come with it. She first worked for Reuters as a stringer during the Algerian Civil War in 1997. In 2000 she covered the conflict between the Albanians and the Serbs in Macedonia. She was assigned to Iraq in 2003. While working in Najaf, she became a staff photographer for Reuters. She covered the South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011, the Tunisian Revolution, the 2011 Libyan Civil War, and the Mosul war in 2017.\\"Photographer notebook: Zohra Bensemra\\", Reuters Full Focus. Retrieved 9 April 2013. She was based as Reuters Chief Photographer in Pakistan (2012-2015) and is currently based in Africa as its West Africa chief photographer. The Tunisian Revolution, Bensemra stated, was the assignment that left the biggest mark on her because she never thought the day would come when the Tunisians would rebel against their ruler, given how controlled the state was. She arrived in Tunis on January 14, 2011, right when a large group of people gathered outside the interior ministry demanding President Zine al-Albidine Ben Ali's resignation. In 2011, Bensemra's photographs were displayed at the Deutsche Bank building in Frankfurt, Germany. The bank's Global Head of Art, Friedhelm H√ºtte, commented: \\"Bensemra is an important artist to us as she knows how to cut through the borders of the mind to leave a lasting and meaningful impression. She has a great ability to show the underlying background stresses and problems in the conflicts of the moment.\\"\\"Meet Zohra Bensemra: Reuters pictures are a work of art\\", Thomson Reuters, 15 April 2011. Retrieved 9 April 2013. In 2012, she visited and took photos in Syria. Her work usually covers \\"conflict, humanitarian issues, and stories about women and politics\\" and is largely based in countries suffering from internal conflict ‚Äì social, economic, or humanitarian. Bensemra stated that her goal when photographing events is to promote a better understanding of the conflict to challenge those in power to improve the situation. Her preferred assignments are stories related to people's struggle for citizenship and human rights against dominating forces. In 2017, Bensemra was chosen as agency photographer of the year by the picture desk of The Guardian.

Livingstone, from the Isle of Lismore in Argyllshire, Scotland, was born in 1865 and appointed as manager of Magomero in 1893. Although he experimented with growing coffee and later cotton, the estate was not a financial success and Livingstone imposed increasingly harsh labour demands on the estate workers there. He was also accused of the brutal mistreatment of those workers. Although Livingstone was immediately responsible for imposing excessive work demands on the workers and their brutal treatment, they were the results of the pressures for financial success that were imposed by Alexander Livingstone Bruce, a director and 40% shareholder in A L Bruce Estates Ltd after he came to live in Nyasaland from 1908. Bruce considered independent African churches were subversive, and instructed Livingstone to destroy the church buildings that John Chilembwe had constructed without Bruce's permission on the Magomero estate. Chilembwe's grievances about colonial rule and the oppression of African estate workers came to focus on William Jervis Livingstone and, when he initiated his revolt on 23 January 1915, Chilembwe ordered some of his men to attack the A L Bruce Estates, to kill all European men and to return with Livingstone's head. Livingstone and three others, including Duncan MacCormick also from Lismore and an African servant, were killed at Magomero, but the women and children were left unharmed on Chilembwe's instructions. In the aftermath of uprising, Livingstone was blamed for the harsh and unsatisfactory conditions on the A L Bruce Estates, whereas Alexander Livingstone Bruce escaped censure. More recently, William Livingstone's character has been re-examined and, although undoubtedly a violent man, he is also regarded as reacting to the demands made by Alexander Livingstone Bruce which he found impossible to meet.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 77-3, 88-90, 127-33, 133-7.  Birth and family  William Jervis Livingstone was born on 8 March 1865 at Bachuil, Isle of Lismore, Argyllshire, in Scotland. His father, Alexander Livingstone (1815-1906), was a Baptist minister and his mother Jessie (n√©e McPherson, 1824‚Äì99) was Alexander‚Äôs second wife. Alexander Livingstone had seven children, of whom three died as infants and two, including William‚Äôs older half-brother, in their twenties. Only William and his younger brother Thomas survived into the 20th century. In 1908, William married Katherine (n√©e MacLachlan), a schoolteacher, and they had three children, one of whom died as an infant.Information from Geni, http://www.geni.com/people/Baron-William-Jervis- Livingstone/6000000000987913269 Both Alexander Livingstone and later his son William claimed the title of Baron of Bachuil, although this dignity was not formally recognised until 2004, and it did not imply ownership of any land.N Livingstone of Bachuil, (2004). The MacLeas or Livingstones of Lismore and their allodial Barony of the Bachuil http://www.baronage.co.uk/2006a/Bachuil.pdf William Jervis Livingstone considered that he was related to David Livingstone, but no direct connection has been proven, particularly in view of the uncertainty about the identity of David Livingstone's grandparents and more remote ancestors.Clan Livingstone website http://www.clanlivingstone.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t;=1038 It has been claimed that David Livingstone‚Äôs daughter Agnes called on William Jervis Livingstone to manage the Magomero Estate after the death of her husband, Alexander Low Bruce, on account of this relationship.Clan Livingstone website http://www.clanlivingstone.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t;=1151&hilit;=Nyasaland&start;=70 However, it is more probable that Alexander Low Bruce made the appointment shortly before his death. Livingstone was 28 years old when he was appointed to manage Magomero and 49 years old when he was killed there on 23 January 1915: most of what is known of him concerns his 21 years as manager of that estate.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 82-3.  Magomero  Origin Agnes (b. 1847), the daughter of David Livingstone married Alexander Low Bruce (b. 1839) in 1875. They had four children including two sons, David Livingstone Bruce (b. 1877) and Alexander Livingstone Bruce (b. 1881).http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~swilson/livingstone/descendants.htm Alexander Low Bruce was a master brewer who supported African commercial and missionary organisations and, after his marriage to Agnes Livingstone, he became a director of the African Lakes Company. He never visited Nyasaland, but obtained title to some 170,000 acres of land there through his association with the African Lakes Company and the agency of John Buchanan, a planter who also brokered land sales by local chiefs. Of this land, 162,000 acres formed the estate that he named Magomero, after a village that David Livingstone had recorded in the same area during his Zambezi expedition. Magomero is situated south of Zomba. On Alexander Low Bruce's death in 1893 aged 54, title to his African assets passed under his will to the A L Bruce Trust, whose main beneficiaries were his two sons, then aged 16 and 12.http://www.nls.uk/catalogues/online/cnmi/inventories/acc11777.pdfJ McCraken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 77-9. Shortly before his death, Alexander Low Bruce had appointed a manager for each of his two estates in Nyasaland. William Jervis Livingstone took control of the main estate of Magomero in Chiradzulu District in 1893 and D.B. Ritchie was placed in charge of the smaller Likulezi Estate near Mlanje. Initially, Agnes assumed oversight of the A L Bruce Trust until Bruce's heirs, David and Alexander, could take over when they came of age. The provisions of their father's will expected them to run the estates: \\"‚Ä¶not on account of any pecuniary advantage‚Ä¶but in the hope and expectation that they will take an interest in the opening up of Africa to Christianity and Commerce on the lines laid down by their grandfather the late David Livingstone.\\"L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, p. 82. However, after their mother‚Äôs death, and as the Magomero estate showed potential, David Livingstone Bruce and Alexander Livingstone Bruce purchased the assets of the A L Bruce Trust in 1913, paying just over ¬£41,000 for its two estates. They then incorporated A L Bruce Estates Ltd in 1913 as a commercial venture with a share capital of ¬£54,000, largely held by the two sons and one of the daughters of Alexander Low Bruce.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 110-11 Crops grown When Magomero was acquired, it was largely unoccupied and uncultivated, and William Jervis Livingstone needed to find suitable crops and workers. At first, he tried unsuccessfully to grow coffee, then turned first to cotton and later to tobacco. Most workers at Magomero were not local people but rather migrants from Mozambique belonging to a number of different Lomwe- speaking groups (so-called \\"Anguru\\").L. White, (1984). 'Tribes' and the Aftermath of the Chilembwe Rising, pp. 513-8. These Lomwe workers came to Magomero as tenants; initially the men had to work for one month a year in lieu of rent: widows and single women were exempt.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 129-30.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 100-1. Livingstone ordered the planting of about 70,000 bushes of Arabica coffee in 200 to 300 acres as the first estate crop at Magomero in 1895, but after poor crops in 1898 and 1899 because of frost and a collapse in world coffee prices in 1903, he looked for more profitable crops.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 82-4. Livingstone turned to cotton from 1903: growing Egyptian cotton was unsuccessful as it was more suitable for hotter areas, but from 1906, he developed a hardier variety of Upland cotton called Nyasaland Upland, and in 1908 planted 1,000 acres at Magomero with it; this was increased to 5,000 acres by 1914. Cotton required intensive labour over a long growing period, and Livingstone ensured that 3,000 to 5,000 workers were available throughout its five or six month growing season by exploiting the obligations of the labour tenancy system called thangata. This word originally meant help, such as one neighbour might give another, but it came to mean the work that a tenant on a European-owned estate had to undertake in lieu of rent. Tenants were also required to undertake additional work on account of the hut tax which the owner paid on behalf of tenants. Other men worked for wages: they were often unpaid, underpaid or given tobacco instead of cash, and violently coerced by the owners.J McCracken, (2012).A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 130-2. Although William Jervis Livingstone pioneered the thangata system at Magomero from 1906, once Alexander Livingstone Bruce came to live in Nyasaland in 1908 and control of the estate operations, he instructed Livingstone, his manager, to exploit thangata rigorously to maximise the amount of cotton grown. The A L Bruce Estates increased the amount of labour demanded in account of rent and Hut tax to four or five months a year, mainly in the rainy season, which was also the main growing season for both cotton and food crops, leaving tenants little time to grow their own food. Single women tenants and widows were now also required to work.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 88-90, 113. Harsh management One of the main reasons that William Jervis Livingstone was killed in the 1915 Chilembwe uprising was the severity of his management. Following the uprising, the protectorate government tried to replace thangata by cash rents. However, Alexander Livingstone Bruce, as a major planter, led estate owners in threatening massive evictions of tenants if this change were implemented, and thangata remained.J McCracken, (2012).A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, p. 146. Even after Livingstone‚Äôs killing, the work obligation on the A L Bruce Estates was little modified, sometimes amounting to six months for thangata and Hut tax. However, as the Crown lands nearest to the estates were already crowded, and as most of the estate tenants were Anguru, who had no claim to settle on those Crown lands, they had little option but to stay.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 133, 146. William Jervis Livingstone was quick-tempered and his actions, including arbitrarily increasing tenants‚Äô workloads and ordering them to be beaten, concerned local district officials from the early years of the 20th century.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 127-9, 133. The physical punishment of workers was fairly widespread in Nyasaland, but as early as 1901 Livingstone was fined for aggravated assault, and there was testimony from his fellow planters that he beat his estate workers and domestic staff with little provocation. However, against this, several headmen from the Bruce Estates confirmed that Livingstone had distributed food to them in times of famine.L White, (1984). 'Tribes' and the Aftermath of the Chilembwe Rising, pp. 524. These headmen were often Muslim ex-soldiers appointed by him to control the mainly migrant estate workforce: there is no suggestion of any widespread food distribution to tenants.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, p. 129. Chilembwe‚Äôs Providence Industrial Mission was the closest mission settlement to Magomero, and it built schools and churches on the estate. Livingstone was justifiably accused of destroying them, but Chilembwe himself deliberately provoked confrontation by erecting churches on private estate land, knowing that the estate owner did not want them built there, and it is clear that Livingstone had to act under orders from Bruce. Unlike the often brutal, sometimes generous, William Jervis Livingstone, Bruce (who had absolute control over estate policy) had the consistent aim of making a profit from its operations. Bruce, whose view was that educated Africans had no place in colonial society and opposed African education, recorded his personal dislike for Chilembwe as an educated African. He considered Chilembwe's churches were centres for agitation, and that by building them on the estate, Chilembwe was making a claim to part of its land. As Livingstone carried out the work of destruction, he, rather than Bruce, became a focus for Chilembwe‚Äôs grievances resulting in his tragic demise.R Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, p.307.  John Chilembwe  John Chilembwe (1871 - 1915) was a Baptist minister who attended a Church of Scotland mission around 1890, and became a servant of the radical missionary Joseph Booth, in 1892. Booth was a Baptist minister until 1898, when he became a convinced Sabbatarian and in 1897 he left Nyasaland accompanied by Chilembwe, who he took to be educated at the Virginia Theological Seminary and College, (now Virginia University of Lynchburg). Chilembwe was ordained as a Baptist minister at Lynchburg in 1899 and returned to Nyasaland in 1900.G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African, pp. 36-8, 47-53, 67- 79, 85-92, 118-23. Chilembwe started his Providence Industrial Mission in Chiradzulu district: in its first decade, it developed gradually, helped by donations from his American backers, and it founded several churches and schools. Initially, Chilembwe avoided any criticism of actions or views that the colonial authorities might think were subversive, but by 1913, he had become more politically militant and openly criticised the government over African land rights and the conditions of tenants, particularly those on the Magomero estate, where many of his mission congregation worked.R. Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, pp. 306-7. In his first decade in Nyasaland after returning from Lynchburg, Virginia, Chilembwe had reasonable success. After 1910 his mission faced rising debt as support from its American backers dried up. His personal life was clouded by the death of a daughter and his own worsening health including asthma attacks and declining eyesight.R. I. Rotberg, (1970). Psychological Stress and the Question of Identity: Chilembwe's Revolt Reconsidered, pp. 365-6. These problems increased Chilembwe's bitterness toward Europeans in Nyasaland, and moved him towards thoughts of revolt. However, the outbreak and effects of the First World War was the key factor in moving him from merely thinking to planning action, which he believed would lead to the deliverance of the African people of Nyasaland.G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African, pp. 234-5, 263.R Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, pp. 308-9. Following a battle at Karonga in September 1914, Chilembwe wrote an impassioned letter to the \\"Nyasaland Times\\" newspaper, saying some of his countrymen, \\"have already shed their blood\\", others were being \\"crippled for life\\" and were \\"invited to die for a cause which is not theirs\\". By December 1914, Chilembwe was regarded with suspicion by the colonial authorities and the Governor decided to deport him and some of his followers.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 81-3. The war-time censor had stopped publication of Chilembwe‚Äôs letter. This, and the possibility that he learned of his intended deportation, prompted Chilembwe to bring forward the timing of his revolt, which made its success more unlikely. Chilembwe gathered a small group of mission-educated Africans as his lieutenants, and in December 1914 and early January 1915, planned to attack British rule in Nyasaland.R Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, pp.309-11. The aims of the rising remain unclear, as Chilembwe and most of his leading supporters were killed in the uprising or later executed, and as many relevant documents in Nyasaland were destroyed in a archive fire in 1919. However, his use of the theme of ‚ÄúAfrica for the Africans‚Äù suggests a political motive rather than a purely religious one. Chilembwe is said to have likened his rising to that of John Brown, and stated his wish to \\"strike a blow and die\\".R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, p. 84.G. Shepperson and T. Price, (1958). Independent African, p. 239, 504-5. His plan involved, firstly an attack on government centres in the Shire Highlands on the night of the 23rd to the 24th of January 1915 to obtain arms and ammunition and, secondly, to attack European estates in that area during the same night. These two parts relied on a force of about 200 men, mainly from Chilembwe's congregations or other independent African churches in the area. Chilembwe also expected there to be simultaneous uprising planned for the Ncheu District which was outside his controlMcCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 137. and for its participants to move south and link up with Chilembwe‚Äôs force. The Ncheu rising was abortive and the first part of Chilembwe's plan failed almost completely: not all the planned attacks were carried out, so few arms were obtained.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 84-6,R Tangri, (1971). Some New Aspects of the Nyasaland Native Rising of 1915, pp. 312-13.  The killing of William Jervis Livingstone  On Saturday 23 January, Chilembwe claimed to have received information that the Europeans would begin killing all Africans on 25 January. He gathered his followers in Mbomwe church, the first he had built after his return from the United States, to give them final instructions for the rising. He did not accompany his men on their attacks, but divided them into several groups with different tasks. Two groups were sent north to attack the A L Bruce Estates with orders to kill all European men and bring back the head of William Jervis Livingstone, but not to harm any women. Most of the remaining men were to head south towards Blantyre, the commercial centre of the protectorate.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 86-7.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 135-6. One of the two groups sent north led by Wilson Zimba was to attack the headquarters of the Magomero estate, which also stored rifles for part of the Nyasaland Volunteer Reserve. The other group under Jonathon Chigwinya was to attack the Mwanje plantation, a part of the Magomero estate some distance from the headquarters. There would normally have been three European men at Magomero, William Jervis Livingstone, his assistant Duncan MacCormick (also from the Isle of Lismore) and J T Roach, the Australian estate engineer, but that night Roach was absent. There were also four European women and five children there. Zimba‚Äôs men surrounded Livingstone‚Äôs house and waited until the family retired for the night at around 9 pm, when several of them broke in, attacked Livingstone with spears and severely wounded him while he attempted to defend himself, using his rifle as a club. He was apparently still alive when he was decapitated with an axe in front of his wife and two small children in their family bedroom.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 87-8.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 136-7. Duncan MacCormick lived alone in a small cottage a few hundred yards from Livingstone's main estate house. His cottage was not surrounded before the attack on Livingstone, but when MacCormick became aware of the commotion, he ran to investigate without arming himself with his rifle and was speared to death.G MacCormick, (2004). Duncan MacCormick, 1888 - 1915 Planter at the Magomero Estate, p. 36. Roach‚Äôs house was attacked after the deaths of Livingstone and MacCormick. When he was found to be absent, two rifles and ammunition he kept there were taken. The whole attack on the estate headquarters was over by 9.30 pm.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, p. 137. Meanwhile, the Mwanje plantation had been attacked around 8 pm. One of the two European men and his servant were speared to death, but the other European fought off his attackers with rifle fire. Two other Africans were killed by the groups sent south, and a European-run mission was set on fire and one of its missionaries was severely wounded.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 89-90 On Sunday 24 January, Chilembwe conducted a service at Mbomwe church next to a pole impaling Livingstone's head, but by 26 January he realised that his uprising had failed. After avoiding early attempts to capture him and apparently trying to escape into Mozambique, he was tracked down and killed on 3 February.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 90-91,L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, p. 138. William Livingstone's wife, Kitty Livingstone, witnessed her husband's attack and beheading at close quarters. Her young daughter, Nyasa, was also a witness to the killing of her father in the family bedroom. Kitty, with her daughter, baby son and the guests that had been staying at Magomero that night had to endure a forced march for three nights and days through the African bush until they were rescued unharmed by the Kings African Rifles.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 137-8.  Reputation  Despite having the name Livingstone and a claim to a notable ancestry, William Jervis Livingstone had no money of his own and, as a mere employee, had an uncertain status among landowning planters. After his death, the 1916 Commission of Enquiry, including government officials and planters, found it convenient to attribute some blame for the Chilembwe revolt to him. His main failing was that he never made financial success of Magomero. However, A L Bruce Estates Ltd was under- capitalised and almost never made a profit except for a few boom years for tobacco after the First World War. His employers expected results and, although Livingstone may have acted reasonably in the early years of being manager at Magomero, once the estate turned to cotton planting, enforcing the heavy demands that cotton cultivation made on workers brought out his brutality. Unlike some landowner-planters, who made money and exercised their authority without having problems with the colonial authorities, Livingstone‚Äôs actions worried officials from early in the first decade of the 20th century. Livingstone was caught between the demands of his employers and being able to treat the African workers and tenants he supervised fairly and reasonably: his employers usually won.L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 83, 127-9, 133, 154. Although most attention had been given to Livingstone, Alexander Livingstone Bruce, who was a director and significant shareholder of A L Bruce Estates Ltd had charge of the company‚Äôs operations in Nyasaland from 1908. Bruce used Livingstone and other European employees to enforce his policies, and tacitly approved of their methods.J McCracken, (2012).A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 130-1. At the official enquiry into Chilembwe‚Äôs uprising held in June 1915, the planters blamed missionary activities, while European missionaries emphasised the dangers of the teaching and preaching of African-led churches like Chilembwe's. African members of European-led churches complained about the treatment of workers on estates. The official enquiry needed to find causes for the rising and it blamed Chilembwe for his mixture of political and religious teaching, but also blamed the unsatisfactory conditions on the Bruce Estates and the unduly harsh regime of William Jervis Livingstone.L White, (1984). 'Tribes' and the Aftermath of the Chilembwe Rising, pp. 523-4. In this enquiry, the Resident at Chiradzulu told the Commission appointed to consider the revolt that the conditions imposed on the A L Bruce Estates were illegal and oppressive, including paying workers poorly or in kind (not in cash), demanding excessive labour from tenants or not recording the work they did, and whipping and beating both workers and tenants. The abuses were confirmed by Magomero workers and tenants questioned by the Commission in 1915.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 78-9. Oral tales, not recorded until much later, include the widely reported and possibly mythical one that Livingstone used to beat corpses at funerals with his walking stick to make sure they were dead and not simply shamming. His wife, who had witnessed the attack on her husband and his beheading, defended him passionately, claiming he was charitable to the hungry and sick. Her defence is quite plausible: Livingstone was quick-tempered and may have been violent and kind at different times. However, his distribution of food may have been limited to the headmen appointed by him to control the estate workforce rather than generalL. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, pp. 126-7.. Her defence was that Livingstone was good master, not a bad one as the commission claimed. The concept of the master-servant relationship was at the heart of colonial society, but this concept was precisely what Chilembwe was fighting with his schools and self-help schemes, and ultimately why Livingstone was killed.L White, (1984).

The Act amends the Public Health Service Act in order to extend, fund, and improve several programs designed to prepare the United States and health professionals in the event of a pandemic, epidemic, or biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear accident or attack. The Act clarifies the authority of different American officials, makes it easier to temporarily reassign personnel to respond to emergency situations, and alters the process for testing and producing medical countermeasures. The Act is focused on improving preparedness for any public health emergency. Background The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 is a follow-up bill to both the Project Bioshield Act of 2004 and the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006. These acts were focused on preparing the country to deal with possible Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) attacks, a high-profile concern in the wake of the September 11 attacks. During the 112th United States Congress, the House voted to pass the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2011 () in a lame duck session, but the bill did not pass in the Senate and never became law. One doctor also argued that the bill was important because it would help doctors deal with critical patients in the event of natural disasters as well as CBRN attacks. Provisions/Elements of the Act This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. Title I: Strengthening National Preparedness and Response for Public Health Emergencies Section 101 of the Act amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to submit the National Health Security Strategy to the relevant congressional committees in 2014. The Act revises the Strategy's preparedness goals, particularly to require that regular preparedness drills also include drills and exercises to ensure medical surge capacity for events without notice. Section 101 also requires that the National Health Security Strategy include: :(1) provisions for increasing the preparedness, response capabilities, and surge capacity of ambulatory care facilities, dental health facilities, and critical care service systems; :(2) plans for optimizing a coordinated and flexible approach to the medical surge capacity of hospitals, other health care facilities, critical care, and trauma care and emergency medical systems; :(3) provisions taking into account the unique needs of individuals with disabilities in a public health emergency; and :(4) strategic initiatives to advance countermeasures to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or treat harm from any biological agent or toxin or any chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents, whether naturally occurring, unintentional, or deliberate. Section 101 further requires the Secretary to: :(1) monitor emerging issues and concerns as they relate to medical and public health preparedness and response for at- risk individuals in the event of a public health emergency; :(2) disseminate and update novel and best practices of outreach to and care of at-risk individuals before, during, and following public health emergencies in as timely a manner as is practicable, including from the time a public health threat is identified; and :(3) ensure that public health and medical information distributed by HHS during a public health emergency is delivered in a manner that takes into account the range of communication needs of the intended recipients, including at-risk individuals. Section 102 of the Act requires the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to provide integrated policy coordination and strategic direction with respect to all matters related to federal public health and medical preparedness and execution and deployment of the federal response for public health emergencies and incidents covered by the National Response Plan before, during, and following public health emergencies. Section 102 then requires the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, with respect to overseeing advanced research, development, and procurement of qualified countermeasures, security countermeasures, and qualified pandemic or epidemic products, to: :(1) identify and minimize gaps, duplication and other inefficiencies in medical and public health preparedness and response activities and the actions necessary to overcome these obstacles; :(2) align and coordinate medical and public health grants and cooperative agreements as applicable to preparedness and response activities authorized under the Public Health Service Act; :(3) carry out drills and operational exercises to identify, inform, and address gaps in and policies related to all-hazards medical and public health preparedness; and :(4) conduct periodic meetings with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to provide an update on, and to discuss, medical and public health preparedness and response activities. Section 102 also changes some of the responsibilities and tasks assigned to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. For example, the Assistant Secretary's office is required to develop and update annually a five-year budget plan based on medical countermeasures priorities. The office is also assigned lead responsibility within the Department of Health and Human Services for emergency preparedness and response policy and coordination. It is also granted authority over and responsibility for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) as well as grants and related authorities related to trauma care. The Assistant Secretary will also now be in charge the Medical Reserve Corps and the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals. The Assistant Secretary is required to develop the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Strategy and Implementation Plan, a coordinated strategy and accompanying implementation plan for medical countermeasures to address chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to conduct an independent evaluation of the strategy and implementation plan. Section 103 creates a new National Advisory Committee on Children and Disasters and sets the termination of the Committee for September 30, 2018. Section 104 revises and reauthorizes through Fiscal Year 2018 the National Disaster Medical System. The section requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take steps to ensure that a range of public health and medical capabilities are represented in the National Disaster Medical System, and that this will take into account the needs of at-risk individuals in the event of a public health emergency. The Act authorizes the Secretary to determine and pay claims for reimbursement for services provided through the National Disaster Medical System directly or through contracts that provide for payment in advance or by way of reimbursement. Section 105 of the Act reauthorizes through Fiscal Year 2018 a program for public health emergency readiness of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. Title II: Optimizing State and Local All- Hazards Preparedness and Response Section 201 of the new law allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize a state or tribe to temporarily reassign state and local public health department or agency personnel funded through Public Health Service Act programs to immediately address a public health emergency in the state or tribe. The Act, however, requires that such reassignments to be voluntary and that the Government Accountability Office evaluate such temporary reassignments. Section 202 of the Act revises and reauthorizes for Fiscal Years 2014-2018 a program of cooperative agreements to improve state and local public health security. It also requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to update periodically the criteria for an effective state plan for responding to pandemic influenza and integrate that criteria into the benchmarks and standards that measure levels of preparedness. The section also sets rules regarding the roll-over of funds from one year to the next. Specific funds are reauthorized to be appropriated for FY2014-FY2018 for the influenza vaccine tracking and distribution program in an influenza pandemic. Section 203 of the Act adds dental entities among those that may carry out education and training activities to improve responses to public health emergencies. Section 203 also reauthorizes the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Health Professions Volunteers (ESAR-VHP) for FY2014-FY2018, which provides a single national interoperable network of systems to verify the credentials and licenses of health care professionals who volunteer to provide health services during a public health emergency. Likewise, the section reauthorizes for FY2014-FY2018 the Medical Reserve Corps to provide for an adequate supply of volunteers in the case of a public health emergency. The Act requires that training exercises incorporate the needs of at-risk individuals in the event of such an emergency. Section 203 also revises and reauthorizes appropriations for FY2014-FY2018 for a program of grants and cooperative agreements to improve surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness. The revisions would ensure that some of the programs address the needs of children and at-risk individuals, and would also make community health centers eligible for the program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to implement objective, evidence-based metrics to ensure that entities receiving such grant awards are meeting, to the extent practicable, the applicable goals of the National Health Security Strategy. Section 204 of the Act reauthorizes appropriations for FY2014-FY2018 for a program to improve public health alert communications and surveillance and public health situational awareness capability. This section adds poison control centers to the integrated system of public health alert communications and surveillance networks. Section 204 requires the Secretary to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a coordinated strategy and an accompanying implementation plan that demonstrates the measurable steps the Secretary will carry out to: :(1) develop, implement, and evaluate the public health situation awareness network; :(2) modernize and enhance biosurveillance activities; and :(3) improve information sharing, coordination, and communication among disparate biosurveillance systems supported by HHS. Section 204 defines \\"biosurveillance\\" as the process of gathering near real-time biological data that relates to human and zoonotic disease activity and threats to human or animal health, in order to achieve early warning and identification of such health threats, early detection and prompt ongoing tracking of health events, and overall situational awareness of disease activity. The National Biodefense Science Board is required to provide expert advice and guidance regarding the measurable steps the Secretary should take to modernize and enhance biosurveillance activities pursuant to the efforts of HHS to ensure comprehensive, real-time all-hazards biosurveillance capabilities. Title III: Enhancing Medical Countermeasure Review Section 301 amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to revise requirements about animal testing. The revision would increase regulatory predictability for medical countermeasures sponsors by expanding the use of Special Protocol Assessments to animal trials and any associated clinical trials necessary to support licensure of medical countermeasures. Section 302, the \\"Authorization for Medical Products for Use in Emergencies\\" amends the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) current Emergency Use Authorization authority to enable the FDA to prepare for and prevent a public health emergency rather than simply responding to it. Section 302 also revises the Secretary of Health and Human Service's authority to allow the use of unapproved medical products or the unapproved use of an approved product. The Secretary is now allowed to make a declaration that the circumstances exist justifying such an authorization and base the determination on: :(1) a (general) threat (rather than a specific threat as under current law), :(2) a significant potential for a public health emergency, :(3) the health and security of U.S. citizens abroad, and :(4) the identification of a material threat sufficient to affect national security. Section 302 outlines the Secretary's new authority to do the following: :(1) extend the expiration date for medical countermeasures intended to be used for emergency responses; :(2) grant waivers of current Good Manufacturing Practices; :(3) authorize emergency dispensing of medical countermeasures during an actual emergency without an individual prescription if permitted under State law or permitted by an order of the Secretary of Health and Human Services; :(4) work with other Health and Human Services agencies to create and issue emergency use instructions concerning a product's conditions of use; and :(5) authorize FDA to waive a product's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy if necessary. Section 303 contains official definitions for security countermeasure, qualified countermeasure and qualified pandemic or epidemic product that will be added to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Section 304 focuses on the relationship between government entities and private companies working on medical countermeasures. The Secretary is required to: :(1) ensure the appropriate involvement of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) personnel in interagency activities related to countermeasure advanced research and development, :(2) ensure the appropriate involvement and consultation of FDA personnel in flexible manufacturing activities, :(3) promote countermeasure expertise within the FDA, and :(4) maintain teams composed of FDA personnel with expertise on countermeasures. The Secretary is required to provide final guidance to industry within one year after enactment of the Act regarding the development of animal models to support approval, clearance, or licensure of countermeasures and epidemic and pandemic products when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. The Secretary must also establish a procedure by which a sponsor or applicant developing a countermeasure for which human efficacy studies are not ethical or practicable, and that has an approved investigational new drug application or investigational device exemption, may request and receive: (1) a meeting to discuss proposed animal model development activities, and (2) a meeting before initiating pivotal animal studies. The Act also requires such meetings to include discussion of animal models for pediatric populations, as appropriate. Section 305 requires the Secretary to establish a formal process for obtaining scientific feedback and interactions regarding the development and regulatory review of eligible countermeasures by facilitating the development of written regulatory management plans. It then details some requirements for this process, such as the ability of a sponsor or applicant to initiate the process by request, the requirement that the FDA work with that sponsor within 90 days, and what components are a necessary part of the regulatory management plan. While Section 305 requires the Secretary to establish regulatory management plans for all security countermeasures for which a request is submitted, it does allow the Director of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to prioritize which other eligible countermeasures may receive regulatory management plans if the Secretary determines that resources are not available to establish regulatory management plans for all other eligible countermeasures. Section 306 directs the Secretary to make publicly available on the FDA website a report detailing the countermeasure development and FDA review activities. Section 307 makes improvements to the current law in order to address the special needs of children. It requires the Secretary to solicit input from the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the Director of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority regarding pediatric studies for medical countermeasures. More specifically, the Act requires the Secretary to consider additional information in developing the priority list of needs in pediatric therapeutics that require study, including the availability of countermeasures to address the needs of pediatric populations. Title IV: Accelerating Medical Countermeasure Advanced Research and Development Section 401 makes changes and updates to the BioShield project. The Act authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into contracts and other agreements that are in the government's best interest in meeting identified security countermeasure needs, including reimbursement of the cost of advanced research and development as a reasonable, allowable, and allocable direct cost of the contract involved. It requires that a contract to procure security countermeasures include a clear statement of defined government purpose limited to uses related to a security countermeasure. Section 401 would also reauthorize the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund (SRF), originally established in 2004. It would reauthorize the SRF at $2.8 billion for FY 2014 ‚Äì 2018, which is consistent with the original appropriation of $5.6 billion over FY 2004 ‚Äì 2013. The new law prohibits SRF funds from being used for anything other than medical countermeasures procurement, research and development. It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide a report to Congress when funds available in the SRF go below $1.5 billion. It would also allow the use of up to 50 percent of funds available in the SRF for advanced research and development of medical countermeasures at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Section 402 reauthorizes BARDA, which was created in 2006 to help bridge the gap between medical countermeasures development and procurement. It would reauthorize BARDA at $415 million for FY 2013 ‚Äì 2017, which is equal to the program's FY 2012 appropriated level. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is instructed to support innovation under BARDA by promoting dose sparing technologies, efficacy increasing technologies, and platform technologies. Section 402 also extends the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemption for specific technical data or scientific information that is created or obtained during countermeasure and product advanced research and development under the Public Health Service Act that reveals significant and not otherwise known vulnerabilities of existing medical or public health defenses against biological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological threats. It likewise extends the antitrust exemption to permit meetings and consultations to discuss the development of security countermeasures, qualified countermeasures, or qualified pandemic or epidemic products. Section 403 reauthorizes the Strategic National Stockpile for FY 2014-FY2018. It requires the Secretary to: :(1) submit to the appropriate congressional committees, to the extent that the disclosure of such information does not compromise national security, the annual review of the contents of the Stockpile; and :(2) review and revise the contents of the Stockpile to ensure that the potential depletion of countermeasures currently in the Stockpile is identified and appropriately addressed, including through necessary replenishment. Section 404 revises membership requirements for the National Biodefense Science Board by adding members with pediatric and state or local expertise. Finally, it requires the Board to give any recommendation, finding, or report provided to the Secretary also to the appropriate congressional committees. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office about H.R. 307 as reported by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on February 14, 2013. The CBO is a public domain source. Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 amends the Public Health Service Act and the United States Code to authorize funding for certain activities carried out by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that would support the readiness of the public health system to address public health and medical emergencies. Based on information provided by the HHS and the VA, the CBO estimates that implementing the act would cost about $11 billion over the 2014-2018 period, assuming the appropriation of the authorized amounts. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, included funding totaling about $2 billion in fiscal year 2012 for activities similar to those that would be authorized by H.R. 307. The CBO assumes that amounts appropriated through the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, for those activities are similar to 2012 levels. H.R. 307 also changes the terms for Project Bioshield contracts, which would result in a change in direct spending. Assuming H.R. 307 is enacted this spring, it would decrease direct spending by $58 million over the 2013-2018 period, but would result in no net change in direct spending over the 2013-2023 period. Because the legislation would affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. Enacting H.R. 307 would not affect revenues. H.R. 307 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). Procedural history House of Representatives The Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on January 18, 2013. It was sponsored by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) and had five original co-sponsors.

He was born into a family of singers on 27 December 1954 in Frimley, Surrey. Watts began his career as a mental health worker having studied clinical psychology before finding success as a musician with his band Fischer-Z. He currently lives and works in Brighton, UK. Career Fischer-Z Having played the punk and new wave circuit through the early 1970s, Watts formed the band Fischer-Z with Steve Skolnik at Brunel University in 1976. Arriving at a point where punk, art wave, and reggae crossed over, they secured a record deal with UA in 1978 alongside the Buzzcocks, The Stranglers, and Dr. Feelgood. Their first album, Word Salad, was released in 1979 and was a cult success in the UK (John Peel supported the single \\"Remember Russia\\"), but an even bigger critical success and commercial start across continental Europe. There were substantial appearances on The Old Grey Whistle Test and a first Top of the Pops with \\"The Worker\\" single. The second album, entitled Going Deaf for a Living (1980), reinforced Watts' trademark insightful and humorous view of the world set against strong melodies. It included the track, \\"So Long\\", his first chart hit single across Europe and in Australia. The band toured extensively throughout Europe and also made their first trip to America. European success was growing fast and the demand for a new album brought Watts back with the powerfully atmospheric Red Skies Over Paradise (1981). A performance at Pinkpop Festival that summer followed and also a performance on the bill with Bob Marley on his final European festival tour. Watts split up Fischer-Z in summer 1981. Solo career and Fischer-Z reformation His first solo album, One More Twist, was released in 1982 along with the debut solo single, One Voice, and was followed in 1983 by The Iceberg Model (1983). This project incorporated Dexys Midnight Runners' brass section, strings, improvisations and experimental techniques usually associated with modern classical music. The Quick Quick Slow album (1984) followed, which he released as The Cry. Reveal, Watts' seventh studio album, appeared early in 1988. This included his biggest single success to date, \\"The Perfect Day\\". Fans found it difficult to differentiate between Watts' identity and that of his band Fischer-Z. This was a new sound and totally different personnel. His reluctance to perform older classic material in its original arrangement and his total emphasis on new work has become his trademark. \\"My only obligation is to be good, not to play what the audience want.\\" The album represented a commercial high point, but coincided with a lengthy period of personal and family upheaval for Watts. A second album in this series, Fish's Head, arrived a year later (1989). Including the single \\"Say No\\". In this period Watts performed to 167,000 people at a Peace Festival in East Berlin along with James Brown. He was interviewed about Thatcherism on German national news. After a change of record companies, Watts combined two different sets of recordings to produce the Destination Paradise album (1992). The title track was a chart single and it once again demonstrated Watts' acute observation of political events. Will You Be There? was another chart single and was adopted by the fans as a firm live favourite. Watts' next project was the Kamikaze Shirt album (1994). The single \\"Human Beings\\", was a harrowing indictment of the low value of human life in many parts of the world. \\"Protection\\", the first single from his next album Stream (1995), also dealt with the dark area of child exploitation. 1997 saw the release of one of Thirteen Stories High (1997). Until then, Watts had worked with a variety of musicians and band line-ups. Instruments had been arranged around his song structures. From this point in his career he was to turn this method on its head. Bigbeatpoetry (1999) and the Spiritual Headcase Remixes (2000) signalled a much more radical approach to making music. This, Watts' thirteenth album, combined his poetry, prose and song lyrics with Ingo Worner's DJ beats, audio collages and dance floor rhythms. The title track, Bigbeatpoetry, was a substantial 'Beat' style poem half-spoken over a simple hip-hop beat. His next album, Real Life Is Good Enough (2004), was recorded spontaneously in a raw 'back to basics' fashion. This was organic multimedia in a different form, the CD accompanied by a 60-page book of related poetry and short stories. It Has To Be (2006) was the album that followed as a sequel to Real Life Is Good Enough. Again, Watts travelled and explored, with the intention of collecting strangers' 'real-life stories', filmed by Sarah Vermeersch. His next Morethanmusic (2011) reinforces his reputation as \\"an artist in music and words.\\" Instead of releasing singles, Watts made exhibitions of artifacts and wrote customised songs. World Go Round (2013 ‚Äì present), Watts new project, entitled World Go Round, is a multimedia combination of a play entitled The Last Picasso, an album called World Go Round and poetry book called The Grand National Lobotomy. Watts is performing the play at the Edinburgh Festival alongside a world tour incorporating different local musicians at each venue and with a variety of musical styles.

It came from Babylon, Iraq, and dates to the time of Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 BCE), king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Striding Lion is one of many such reliefs that decorated the walls of the palace's ceremonial hall and very similar to the lions that line the processional way from the Ishtar Gate to the temple of Marduk. A large group of such figures is part of the Processional Way leading to the Ishtar Gate, a centrepiece display of the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. Other panels were sold by Berlin, such as the Panel with striding lion in New York.  Description  Sections of the Processional Way in the Pergamon Museum, Berlin The relief measures 122 cm (height) by 183 cm (width) by 8 cm (depth).Striding Lion. #25 of 66 images with description provided on the Royal Ontario Museum website. , retrieved February 25, 2013. Several of the bricks are stamped with the inscription: \\"Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the first born son of Nabopolassar, the king of Babylon\\".Striding Lion podcast made by the Royal Ontario Museum. , accessed March 20, 2013.  Origin  The ceremonial hall in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II had a tiled wall decorated with glazed columns, lotus buds and palmettes with lions striding around the base, of which the example in the Royal Ontario Museum is one.Dyson, R.H. 1963. A Babylonian Lion. Expedition 5.2: 14-15. From 1899 to 1917, Robert Koldewey led a German expedition that excavated Babylon. The fragments of tile found in the ceremonial hall of the palace, also referred to as the throne room of the Southern Citadel, were taken back to Berlin and painstakingly reassembled, as were the tiles from the Ishtar Gate and Processional Way. In 1937 the Royal Ontario Museum purchased the reconstructed striding lion relief from the State Museums of Berlin.  Production method  Robert Koldewey suggested that the lions, and other reliefs lining the Processional Way, were made using molds taken from a master clay panel, or from a temporary wall with a plaster facing that had been cut down into brick sized segments. Care had been taken to ensure the joints were not too visible and the relief work such as to facilitate removal from a mold. The bricks were then fired in a kiln, and then glazed with the appropriate colours. Marks were made on a tile's upper edge to enable it to be placed in proper sequence when assembled. The system of marks used for assembling the reliefs could be most clearly seen on the tiles from the ceremonial hall because of the way they had fallen after robbers had taken bricks from the wall.Koldewey, R. 1914.The Excavations at Babylon, trans. A.S. Johns, pp. 28-30, 103-107. London: Macmillan and Co. Scanned copy issued by Nabu Press in 2012.  Significance of lion symbolism  Lions were symbolic of royalty because of their strength, and fighting a lion gave a king great prestige. The lion was also the symbol of Ishtar, the goddess of love and war. In her role of the goddess of war she is depicted, bow in hand, on a chariot drawn by seven lions.Guirand, F. 1959.

Life Wacklin was born in Oulu, but has long been a mystery to scientists and art historians. Atheneum conservation-led research team has since 2005 studied the fate of the artist. Wacklin's parents were postmaster Wacklin Mikael and Helena Paldani. His wife was Magdalena Losch. In 1743 he applied for a passport to travel to St. Petersburg. As an artist there he was able to provide for his family, which he was unable to do in Finland. He died in Stockholm, aged 38. Career Wacklin studied portrait painting Royal Swedish Academy of Arts between 1731‚Äì1734, wallpaper painting in Saint Petersburg, and he is also to have studied in Copenhagen. Wacklin was the first professional artist in Finland. He painted portraits, especially in the late 1750s, and along with Nils Schillmark was one of the early Finnish landscape artists. Wacklin was also the only representative of the Finnish rococo movement. Wacklin rococo paintings used dark colors. Wacklin portrait paintings often depict the figures with an ovaloid head, narrow eyes and a long nose. As with most professional artists at that time, he used layer coating techniques in his paintings. Works Wacklin is known from 36 known surviving painting, but there may still be unidentified works as well in Sweden. Of the known works there are 27 where current whereabouts of the painting and the owner is known. His paintings can be found in Finnish museums and private collections such as the Atheneum Museum of Art, Gyllenberg Foundation, and the Finnish National Gallery which has 19 paintings. Abroad paintings is the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm and Denmark's Frederiksborg Palace. References * Tuulikki Kilpinen: Young unknown.

The Archive holds over 20000 poems and keeps the recordings safe and accessible so that current and future visitors can enjoy them. Each poet's work is surrounded by contextual information and biographies and has become a treasured resource for anyone looking for poetry. The Poetry Archive was founded by recording producer Richard Carrington and poet Andrew Motion, during his appointment as UK Poet Laureate in 1999 and is now led by Director Tracey Guiry. Recordings of contemporary work began in 2000 and the first website went live in 2005. The Poetry Archive is a not-for-profit registered UK charity. Formation and development The archive was established as a web-based library to ensure that the oral record of modern poets is not lost, as it has been with writers such as Thomas Hardy, D. H. Lawrence and A. E. Housman whose voices were never recorded, despite the technology being available at the time. The resource is built on the idea that poets have a unique relationship with their own work and are often able to communicate the nuance, musicality and subtlety of it, with a deeper understanding than actors. Texts to the poems and other resources are available but the poet's voice is the main concern of the site. Motion has stated \\"To hear the speed at which a poet reads, to hear their accent, to hear how they inflect their voice, to hear how they create a space around their words - or don't - all add to our using of what the meaning of poem might be.\\" Contemporary studio recordings for the project began in 2000, shortly after Motion was appointed a Poet Laureate, and the site went live in 2005. Most of the recordings are created especially for the Archive and these are augmented by some classic poems read by well-known readers. New recordings are regularly added and there is also a download store which allows people to purchase and download audio poetry directly from the website. In the first year, the site had 500,000 visitors, building to over 1.5 million annual users in 2008, nearly 2 million in 2009 and over 3 million currently in its 20th year of recording. The project continues to be funded by the National Lottery, government grants and private donors. The current president is Sir Daniel Day- Lewis. The previous president was the late poet Seamus Heaney Content In May 2019 the Children's Poetry Archive site launched to offer a website designed for children to explore and enjoy https://childrens.poetryarchive.org/. As of July 2020, the readings of over 550 poets are available on the two sites, with content searchable by title, author, theme, and form. Historic recordings available on the archive include Alfred Tennyson (recorded by Thomas Edison 1890), Robert Browning (1889), Rudyard Kipling (1921) W. B. Yeats (1932) and Langston Hughes (1955). Contemporary writers include Seamus Heaney, Billy Collins, Carol Ann Duffy and John Ashbery. The work of New Zealand Allen Curnow was recorded shortly before his death in 2001, one of the first to be archived. Cornish poet Charles Causley gave a reading aged 86, in the year before he died in 2003. Motion commented: ::It's a fantastically powerful recording that was done a matter of days before his death. It doesn't show on the recording, but Richard, who made the recording, said that between each poem Charles broke down and wept, and had to gather himself. He knew that he was dying. He was saying goodbye to each of his poems. If you only listen to one of the poems on the website, listen to \\"Eden Rock\\". It's a great poem and he reads it so beautifully and introduces it so touchingly. In 2006 historic readings by Dylan Thomas, Ted Hughes and Walter de la Mare, were added. That same year, the project worked with the BBC to archive rare readings by Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves and Philip Larkin. In 2008 over 60 American recordings were archived on the site, in collaboration with the Poetry Foundation, based in Chicago. Readers include Ted Kooser, Robert Pinsky, and Philip Levine. The Children's ARchive also includes work by poets such as Roald Dahl, Spike Milligan, Michael Rosen. The website also now features collections of classic poetry being read by contemporary poets and some famous voices, including Helen Mirren, Stephen Fry, Judi Dench and Alan Rickman. The archive also includes extensive material for teachers and students, including glossaries, biographies and lesson plans that integrated as a school resource. In 2012, independent activist Phantom Bill Stickers pasted poems up in public spaces in New Zealand cities, featuring bar codes that could be scanned by smart phones. The code linked to the writers reading their poem on the Poetry Archive.

Four Aspects of the Film Arno Press, 1978LAST OF THE REDSKINS Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 16, Iss. 181, (Jan 1, 1949): 100. Unlike other adaptations the film includes a boy brother of Cora and Alice Munro and does not feature Chingachgook nor does it feature a romance between Uncas and Cora. The battle of Fort William Henry is not shown and most of the characters in the film ride horses rather than moving by foot. Plot During the French and Indian War in 1757, the family of Colonel Munro, daughters Alice and Cora and son Davy come from England to visit their father who is commanding Fort William Henry in the American colonies. The French are masters of the military intelligence situation as they have their loyal Indian allies masquerading as scouts for the English and are able to intercept and kill all runners from the British outposts. General Webb, the commander of Fort Edward where the Munros have arrived has fallen for French ruses by believing that General Montcalm's French and Indian forces are advancing from the South. General Webb's Indian Scout Magua testifies to the truth of this information convincing General Webb to send his forces South and send the Munro family to the believed safety of their father General Munro to the north at Fort William Henry. The only person who does not believe Magua is the Colonial Scout Hawkeye and his Indian companion Uncas. Hawkeye's rough ways, honesty, and vocal common sense has alienated him from the British military command. In reality, Magua was once flogged by General Munro for being drunk and sees the chance to torture and murder the Munro children as a pinnacle of revenge. Leading the Munros accompanied by Major Duncan Heyward and a small British military escort into an Iroquois ambush, Magua is thwarted by the arrival of Hawkeye and Uncas who rescue the Major and the Munros. The Major wins Hawkeye over by declaring that he would be placing his pride over the lives of the party if he didn't give command of the evasion party to the experienced Hawkeye. The group manages to evade Magua's pursuing Indians for a brief period, but Hawkeye arranges for a better chance for escape by having Heyward and the Munros captured then rescued by Hawkeye and Uncas. On their escape from the camp the party runs across the garrison of Fort William Henry who declare that they gave an honourable surrender of the fort to the French and were allowed to keep their arms but not their ammunition. Hawkeye suspects the Indians will massacre the party and organises a defence.

On 25 April 1861 the two companies combined and expanded to form the 2nd Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The regiment was mustered into federal service a month later on 25 May 1861 and fought for the duration of the Civil War. The regiment mustered out of Federal service on 29 June 1865. Companies from the Saginaw and Flint areas withdrew from the regiment in 1876 and consolidated with elements of the 1st Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment to form the 3rd Infantry Regiment. In April 1915, the 3rd Infantry Regiment was designated as the 33rd Infantry. The regiment was mustered into federal service in June 1916 and was drafted in August 1917. The 33rd combined with the 1st Battalion, 31st Infantry to form the new 125th Infantry Regiment. The regiment was summarily assigned to the 32nd Infantry Division. Recent history =1-125th Infantry= Task Force 1-125 Infantry began flowing into Afghanistan in December 2011. Inclement weather delayed many of the battalion soldiers entry into theater until late January. Relief-in-place was conducted with the 2nd Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, 170th Infantry Brigade Combat Team for Forward Operating Base Kunduz, Kunduz City, Kunduz Province, Afghanistan. Other battalion locations were in Imam Sahib City, Imam Sahib District, Kunduz Province; Shir Khan Bandar, Imam Sahib District; and Doshi District, Baghlan Province. Each company deployed with a security force assistance team, consisting of a senior advisor and senior noncommissioned officer, along with several subject matter expert enablers. The companies conducted security force missions to secure the advising teams during key leader engagements and other meetings with their Afghan National Security Force counterparts. The SFATs partnered, assisted and advised their counterparts initially on operations, rule of law, logistics, training/administration, government/development and maintenance/signal. The main effort switched to logistics, with the intent of enabling the ANSF to be self-sustaining to increase their operational capabilities. This effort met with mixed results and led to another change in priority to operations and rule of law being the main effort with logistics and human resource operations as supporting efforts. During the spring, elements of the battalion closed one combat outpost, with SFAT operations in that area ceasing shortly after. HHC HHC was responsible for base defense operations and Mayor Cell duties of Forward Operating Base Kunduz. They improved operations and upgraded security by implementing new procedures during searches for entering the FOB. They had more than 7,000 entries in the Biometrics Automated Toolset System and vehicles searched and processed through the entry control point. They also developed and coordinated more than 50 base improvement projects to improve the quality of life for all FOB tenants. A Company Ethan Bednar, a rifleman with Company A, 1st Battalion, 125th Infantry assists a German infantryman, assigned to Task Force Kunduz, firing a M249 light machine gun during range fire at Forward Operating Base Kunduz, AfghanistanA Company was responsible for three distinct security force advisory missions: 3rd platoon provided security forces for the Khanabad District advising mission, which was successfully handed over to Afghan leadership; 2nd platoon provided SECFOR and helped strengthen the security and force protection measures for the Afghan Operations Coordination Center (Provincial), and the Provincial Headquarters in Kunduz; 1st platoon aided in teaching rule of law classes and provided SECFOR for the Gor Teppa area outside Kunduz City. Gor Teppa was the focal point and testing ground for the new evidence-based operations mission set that focused efforts on community-based policing and ANSF investigating and pursuing prosecution of crimes committed in the area. B Company B Company was responsible for the border crossing mission at Combat Outpost Shir Khan, along with supporting an SFAT. C Company C Company worked with an SFAT and the Afghan Uniform Police and National Directorate of Security in the Imam Sahib and Dasht-e Archi Districts. In late February, COP Fortitude was the scene of a peaceful demonstration that turned violent. Multiple soldiers were injured during this event. Company leadership demonstrated tactical restraint when they chose to use only non-lethal munitions and tactics to disperse the crowd of mostly peaceful demonstrators, with suspected insurgent agitators mixed in. In late May, the COP was dismantled and the area turned back over to the ANSF. D Company D Company conducted security force assistance for more than 300 Afghan Uniform Police in Baghlan province at the PHQ and Doshi district headquarters. As part of that mission, they conducted multiple combined dismounted patrols with the Doshi AUP. They also conducted multiple missions to the Salang Pass to ensure ISAF and civilian freedom of movement. During these missions, they aided in a security and recovery operation, as well as an assistance and humanitarian aid mission after an avalanche. H Company, 237th BSB H Company provided logistics and sustainment operations for the entire battalion. They brought the operational readiness rate of the battalion from 80 to 98 percent for more than 150 tactical vehicles. They also turned in more than $200 million of excess equipment and repair parts. The Distribution Platoon traveled more than 50,000 miles to ensure all locations had the necessary supplies and equipment to run their daily operations.

The shock's epicenter was in the province of Bushehr, near the city of Khvormuj and the towns of Kaki and Shonbeh. At least 37 people were killed, mostly from the town of Shonbeh and villages of Shonbeh-Tasuj district, and an estimated 850 people were injured. Tectonic setting Iran lies within the complex zone of collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The rate of convergence between the plates near the epicentre is about per year, of which only part is taken up within the Zagros fold and thrust belt. The earthquake was the result of thrust faulting on a NW-SE trending fault plane, consistent with continuing shortening of the Arabian Plate. Earthquake At 16:22 IRDT (11:52 UTC) on April 9, 2013, an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.3 struck the southwestern coast of Iran, in Bushehr Province. It struck at a depth of , near the towns of Khvormuj and Kaki. \\"Dozens\\" of aftershocks followed, most within the first hour of the main quake. The strongest aftershock had a magnitude of 5.6. The area is home to ten thousand people and fifty villages. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that 80,000 people experienced strong tremors while several million felt light shaking. The earthquake was felt in many countries around the Persian Gulf, including Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Damage At least 37 people were killed and an estimated 850 were injured by the earthquake. Most of those killed were in the town of Shonbeh and villages of Shonbeh-Tasuj District. Of the injured, 100 required hospitalization. Two villages in the Khvormuj district were reported to have been \\"levelled\\". Landslides caused by the earthquake were reported in Kaki City. According to provincial governor Fereydun Hasanvand, 700 homes were damaged, affecting 200 families. Many residents in the Shonbeh District lost power and water services. Residents took to the streets in search of safety as aftershock after aftershock hit. A report by Iran's International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology stated that most of the buildings damaged were adobe buildings constructed in the last 50 years; and that 100 houses were destroyed, 1,000 people were left homeless, and that about $50 million in damage occurred. The Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant was not damaged, according to its operator and the governor of the province. It was built to withstand a magnitude 8 earthquake, according to an official. Aftermath Iran's Red Crescent Society and the Iranian Navy sent teams to Bushehr Province on the first night to deliver first aid. Several helicopters from nearby provinces helped airlift in emergency supplies. Temporary shelters were erected in the first week after the earthquake. Three days of national mourning were announced on April 9.

Historians found that the current temple was a Buddhist monastery known as Kandarika Vihara. The shrine had a standing Buddha image in it. This image was replaced by the King Kundvarma of the Alupa dynasty, who was a devotee of Shiva. However it was not the Buddha but a bodhisattva who was historically integrated with Shiva. Historians concluded that the vihara was originally a centre of the cult of the bodhisattva Manjusri. This temple was one of the famous centres of learning and pilgrimage until the 11th century AD. This particular doctrine opened the doors for Tantric religion. Both Shilinga and the bodhisattva were worshipped for many centuries until the Buddhist temple was converted to a purely Saivite temple.

A military station was established at Mpala on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in May 1883. It was transferred to the White Fathers missionaries in 1885. At one time it was hoped that it would form the nucleus of a Christian kingdom in the heart of Africa. However, after a military expedition had to be sent to protect the mission from destruction by local warlords in 1892, civil control returned to the Belgian colonial authorities. The first seminary in the Congo was established at Mpala, and later the mission played an important role in providing practical education to the people of the region. Location Mpala lies on the west shore of Lake Tanganyika in Tanganyika Province, to the north of Moba and south of Kalemie. The station was established at the mouth of the Lufuku River. The lake is about long and across. An 1898 book described it as an inland sea, navigated by a regular flotilla. At that time Albertville (now Kalemie), Mpala and Baudouinville (now Kirungu) were the main stations on the west shore of the lake. Captain Storms, who founded Mpala, said the climate was healthy. According to an 1886 in the Dublin Review, Foundation √âmile Pierre Joseph Storms, the Belgian officer who founded Mpala The main street and the fortress built by √âmile Storms at Mpala In 1882 the International African Association had a military post at Karema on the east shore of Lake Tanganyika. Captain √âmile Storms took command of this post, then founded Mpala on the west shore of the lake, opposite Karema on the east shore, laying the foundations on 4 May 1883. He was assisted by the German explorer Paul Reichard. He named the station after the friendly local chief Mpala, who on his deathbed told his people to obey the Europeans. Storms gained authority during the two and a half years he spent at Mpala. The local chiefs came to rely on him for a monthly salary and for protection. On 30 November 1884 Reichart arrived at Mpala, coming from Katanga, and told him that his companion Richard B√∂hm had died in March. A cable sent by Reichard from Mpala reported laconically \\"B√∂hm dead. Lake Upemba, Lufira [River], copper mines Katanga discovered\\". Storms had his people build a great square stockade on each side, using five thousand trees. The walls were made of mudbrick and were thick. The interior had seventeen rooms around a covered courtyard. On 19 May 1885, Storms' great stockade was burned to the ground. Once the dried thatch had caught fire, little could be saved apart from the gunpowder. Storms found himself in a violent confrontation with Lusinga Iwa Ng'ombe, a powerful slaver whom the explorer Joseph Thomson called a \\"sanguinary potentate\\". In the end, Lusinga was beheaded. Another leader, Kansawara, who had submitted to Storms, decided to move into the vacancy left by Lusinga. He was defeated on 15 December 1884 and soon after submitted to Storms. At the Berlin Conference (1884-1885) the east side of the lake was assigned to the German sphere of influence. King Leopold II of Belgium decided to focus his colonizing efforts on the lower Congo. He asked Mgr. Charles Lavigerie, the founder of the White Fathers missionary society, if he would like to replace the Belgian agents by missionaries at the two stations on Lake Tanganyika. Mgr. Lavigerie had a dream of founding a Christian kingdom in equatorial Africa to halt the tribal wars and to provide a base for the propagation of the faith. He wrote to Father L√©once Bridoux that this could be the moment to try to establish a Christian kingdom. When Storms heard that he was to be recalled, he was furious. However, when two French priests, Isaac Moinet and Auguste Moncet, reached Mpala on 5 July 1885, Captain Storms handed over the fort, arms and ammunition, a sailboat and a garrison of askaris who had been paid for six months. The priests had five servants, of whom one was Christian. The mission that had been founded at Mkapakwe on 12 September 1884 was transferred to the new mission, now called Mpala Notre Dame. Moinet asked Storms what title he should take as successor to \\"His Majesty Emile the First, King of Tanganyika\\", and signed a letter he wrote to Storms \\"I, Moinet, Acting King of Mpala.\\" However, the priests were committed to Lavigerie's dream of a Christian Kingdom, and saw the territory that Storms had acquired as the nucleus of the new state. Christian kingdom Cardinal Charles Lavigerie, who dreamed of making Mpala a Christian kingdom The memory of the execution of Lusinga helped the priests, since the local chiefs did not want to suffer the same fate. However, the fathers inherited a difficult situation. Various chiefs had submitted to Storms, giving him authority over a territory that extended along the lake shore and inland. This came with responsibility for defense and for resolving disputes. The fathers led a military expedition against a rebel leader in which villages were burned and slaves captured. This was not the role of a missionary. The French soldier Captain L√©opold Louis Joubert offered his services to Lavigerie, and this was accepted in a letter of 20 February 1886. Joubert reached Zanzibar on 14 June 1886, and reached the mission at Karema on the east shore of the lake on 22 November 1886. He remained there for some months at the request of the Vicar Apostolic, Mgr. Jean-Baptiste- Fr√©zal Charbonnier, to protect the mission against attacks by slavers. He crossed the lake and reached Mpala on 20 March 1887. Charbonnier had given him full authority as civil and military ruler of the Mpala region. He found that the priests had organized a police force of local warriors. Immediately after arriving, Joubert was thrown into the struggle with dealers in slaves and ivory. He engaged in skirmishes in March and again in August, where his small force of thirty soldiers armed with rifles came close to defeat. Joubert again had to intervene in November 1887, and in 1888 defeated a force of 80 slavers, but his forces were too small to prevent continued attacks. The constant fighting also worried some of the missionaries, notably Father Fran√ßois Coulbois, who were concerned that the slavers might decide to attack the mission itself. Joubert married Agnes Atakaye on 13 February 1888. She was the daughter of Kalembe, from Mpala. They were to have ten children, two of whom became priests. When Mgr. Charbonnier died on March 16, 1888, Coulbois became Pro-Vicar of Upper Congo. He did not recognize that Joubert had civil authority, and imposed tight restrictions on his actions. Both men appealed for support to Cardinal Lavigerie. In response, Lavigerie said that the missionaries must have no involvement with military affairs, and the military leader must live at a distance from the mission to avoid being identified with the mission. The new Vicar Apostolic, Bishop Bridoux, arrived in January 1889. He confirmed that Joubert was both civil and military leader, but said that military operations must be purely defensive. Joubert moved to St Louis de Murumbi, some distance away. In January 1889 the mission was cut off from the outside world by Abushiri Revolt against the Germans in Bagamoyo and Dar es Salaam. The mission suffered from repeated and deadly raids. In 1890 the slavers Rajabu and Rumaliza launched a major attack on Mpala from the lake, but were beaten off. By 1891 the slavers had control of the entire western shore of the lake apart from Mpala and the Mrumbi plain. Return to security A relief expedition was organized. It was led by Captain Alphonse Jacques and three other Europeans, and reached Zanzibar in June 1891, Karema on 16 October 1891 and Mpala on 30 October 1891. Captain Jacques gave Captain Joubert papers that made him a Belgian citizen and officer of the armed forces. The expedition fought another pitched battle against the slavers. They founded the fortress of Albertville, and a few months later it was besieged by Rumaliza. The European press was critical of these actions, described as \\"military adventures of Cardinal Lavigerie\\". Jacques left the volunteer Alexis Vrithoff to assist Joubert. Vrithoff died during an engagement on 5 April 1892. The danger from slavers was not finally removed until the 1893 expedition of Baron Francis Dhanis. The ‚Äúkingdom‚Äù of Mpala was absorbed into the King Leopold‚Äôs Congo Free State. Joubert lived on at St Louis de Murumbi until 1910, when it was abandoned due to sleeping sickness. He died at Moba on 27 May 1927. Later years View from Mpala, 1892 Although officially part of the Congo. the territory of Mpala retained considerable autonomy through the first half of the 1890s, administered by the missionaries. The White Fathers erected a church and other buildings, and established gardens. A species of catfish locally called ndjagali use the Lufufo river for spawning from September to November. The fish are considered a delicacy by the people of the region. In the past they were owned and caught communally, and traded with other communities for salt or iron. The people considered that the spirit of the earth, Kaomba, caused them to multiply. The catfish were a major source of food for the villagers. The missionaries recognized the beliefs about Kaomba and identified the sacred parts of the river. For many years they controlled access to the river, using it for their own food or to reward those loyal to them. A catechist training center was established in 1893. On 26 August 1897 Father Auguste Huys arrived at Mpala, and after a few months was made director of the catechist school. He founded the first junior seminary in the Congo. After the summer holidays of 1898, with the authority of the Vicar-General Mgr. Victor Roelens, he brought all the most pious and best behaved pupils to Mpala and began to teach them the elements of Latin grammar. Soon after, Father Joseph Weghsteen created a Latin-Swahili grammar, which he printed on the press at Mpala. A history of the church and other works were also printed. The junior seminary was officially inaugurated on 3 January 1899, with six candidates. In 1904 the first signs of sleeping sickness appeared, and for several years the disease raged among the population and the missionaries. Seven of the twenty one missionaries died. The missionaries built a sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin on one of the hills that overlooked the Mpala plain in the hope that she would provide protection against the epidemic. They also built lazarets where the White Sisters could provide assistance and comfort to the sick. On 19 July 1905 all the pupils at Mpala left for the mission at Lusaka Saint-Jacques et Sainte Emilie, about inland from the lake. With technological advances at the start of the twentieth century it became possible to fish the lake far from the shores, and fishing became an individual occupation, rather than communal as before. In 1920 Father Tielemans, Superior of the Mpala mission, launched the Catholic Scouting movement in the Congo with a group of Sea Scouts. The mission developed commercial farming of wheat, potatoes and onions in the period between the two world wars. The missionaries taught the local people carpentry, masonry and boat making, all valuable skills. The majority of the mission-trained people found well paid work in commercial enterprises. The old fortified buildings were still standing in 2005. The buildings in the Mpala region today combine old and new forms. The materials and method of construction are traditional, but the rectangular structures draw from the traditional Western designs promoted by the missionaries.

Overview The DPDK framework creates a set of libraries for specific hardware/software environments through the creation of an Environment Abstraction Layer (EAL).DPDK Docs, Data Plane Development Kit: Programmers Guide, September 2017 The EAL hides the environment specifics and provides a standard programming interface to libraries, available hardware accelerators and other hardware and operating system (Linux, FreeBSD) elements. Once the EAL is created for a specific environment, developers link to the library to create their applications. For instance, EAL provides the frameworks to support Linux, FreeBSD, Intel IA-32 or 64-bit, IBM POWER9 and ARM 32- or 64-bit. The EAL also provides additional services including time references, generic bus access, trace and debug functions and alarm operations. The DPDK implements a low overhead run-to- completion model for fast data plane performance and accesses devices via polling to eliminate the performance overhead of interrupt processing. The DPDK is also in the process of including the event-based programming model for fast data plane processing. The DPDK also includes software examples that highlight best practices for software architecture, tips for data structure design and storage, application profiling and performance tuning utilities and tips that address common network performance deficits.

The blackout was to back a demand for the unconditional release of the arrested bloggers. A fundamentalist group named Hefajat-e-Islam Bangladesh started a campaign to hang freethinking bloggers, and demanding tough blasphemy laws. In response, the government started monitoring Bengali blog sites and sending letters to their authorities to terminate the alleged \\"anti-religious\\" blogs and provide information about the alleged \\"anti-religious\\" bloggers. Individual bloggers showed their solidarity with this blackout by changing their profile photos on Facebook and by tweeting with the #MuzzleMeNot hashtag. Different international organizations expressed deep concern about taking free-thinking bloggers into custody. After 92 hours of blackout, blogs returned online by publishing a press release on their central Facebook page. Background From the beginning of the Shahbag protest, bloggers came out on the streets to demand capital punishment of Abdul Quader Molla, a war criminal of the Bangladesh liberation war and a leader of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. During the protests, a controversial author, pro-Shahbag blogger and online activist Sunnyur Rahman, popularly known as 'Nastik Nobi' (Atheist Prophet) in the blog community, was stabbed on 7 March 2013. Another pro-Shahbag blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider who was critical of Jamaat-e-Islami, was killed by a few Jamaat activists. Afterwards, a Jamaat backed Islamic fundamentalist organisation started a violent protest demanding the death penalty for all allegedly \\"anti-Islamic\\" bloggers, and they termed all participants of the Shahbag movement as atheist. The spokesperson of the Shahbag movement Imran H. Sharkar said, Hifazat-e-Islam is desperate to thwart the war crimes trial and the process of banning Jamaat-e-Islami. Afterwards, the government of Bangladesh started monitoring the blogosphere and sent letters to the Bengali blog authorities to terminate the alleged \\"anti-religious\\" blogs and to provide information about the alleged \\"anti-religious\\" bloggers. On the night of 1 April 2013, three bloggers were arrested by the detective branch (DB) police. Blogger Rasel Pervez, a prominent physicist and blogger and Mashiur Rahman Biplob were arrested on 1 April 2013 from their house. Subrata Adhikari Shuvo, who is a masters student of the Bengali department at the University of Dhaka, was also arrested on the same day from his university dormitory. Another blogger Asif Mohiuddin was called to the police station on 3 April 2013, and when he went there, he was arrested. Earlier, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission forced the Bengali blog somewhereinblog.net to remove all writings present blog page reads: \\"blog has been withdrawn or cancelled for violating terms and conditions\\" (transl.) of Asif Mohiuddin. The move was criticized by Human Rights Watch, \\"the government is abandoning any serious claim that it is committed to free speech,\\" said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Amnesty International, Center for Inquiry, Reporters Without Borders, Committee to Protect Journalists, and several other bodies.

It is owned by Grupo Disco. The transmissions began in 1962  History  It was the third and last private free-to-air channel that opened in Montevideo. His studios are located on 1276 Enriqueta Compte y Riqu√© Street, being the only one of the private ones that was always kept in its original place. Its first director was Ra√∫l Galana, but soon Horacio Scheck took his place. The station's antenna was installed for several years on the roof of the newspaper El Pa√≠s, but for several years it has been located in the Congress Tower, in the Tres Cruces district. The first slogan was \\"The Family Channel\\". It first shows were El Show del Mediod√≠a, presented by comedians Cacho de la Cruz and Alejandro Trotta, and Telecatapl√∫m, which managed to achieve great success in Argentina. The channel's newscast is Telemundo. In 1981, with the beginning of color television in Uruguay, the channel took the name \\"Teledoce Televisora Color\\", but then stopped using that name, becoming simply \\"Teledoce\\" and later \\"La Tele\\". Since 2003 it broadcasts the event to raise funds for disabled children called Telethon Uruguay together with Channel 10. After a few years, Channel 4, TNU, and finally VTV joined.

Spears (Narragansett/Niantic) is an educator, essayist, artist, and two-term Tribal Councilwoman of the Narragansett Tribe in Providence, Rhode Island, where she currently resides. Spears has taught for over two decades, including 12 years in the Newport Public School system working with at-risk children in both first and fourth grades. In 2010, Spears was chosen as one of 11 Extraordinary Women honorees for Rhode Island in the area of education.  Education  Spears is a graduate of Chariho High School, located in Richmond, Rhode Island. She earned her bachelor's degree in elementary education at the University of Rhode Island (1988) and went on to earn her master's degree, also in education, at the University of New England, graduating there in 2002.  Career and accomplishments  In addition to her years spent teaching, Spears has devoted much time to strongly advocating for integrating more Native history and experiential learning into school curricula. Spears is quoted as remembering, ‚Äú...being in a history class during my elementary days and actually reading that I supposedly didn‚Äôt exist, that my family didn‚Äôt exist, that my people didn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù She has spent much of her adult life, therefore, \\"correcting that misimpression.\\" Furthermore, Spears works as the Executive Director and curator of the Tomaquag Indian Memorial Museum in Exeter, Rhode Island. The museum was the site of a private, state-certified school, the Nuweetooun (Narragansett for \\"Our Home\\") School, which Spears ran from 2003 to 2010. According to an article by fellow Narragansett mover John Christian Hopkins, the school was founded by Spears with the help of the Narragansett community and donations from many groups, including a local charity, the Narragansett Tribe, as well as the Rhode Island Foundation. Though Spears is Narragansett, the school is not linked to any particular tribe. Nuweetooun gave K-8 Native children an experiential, collaborative curriculum based in Native American traditions and culture, as well as standard academic subjects (i.e. Math, Language Arts, Social Studies, Health and Science). In March 2010, the Supreme Court made a ruling that led to the removal of 31 acres of land out of trust from the Narragansett reservation in Charlestown. Since the tribe had much less land for money-making ventures, they had less money to provide to the school. In addition, in 2010 Rhode Island was hit with devastating floods, which ultimately forced the school to go on hiatus, where it remains today. Spears was appointed by Gina Raimondo to serve on the Board of the RI State Council on the Arts and issued as a board member on The Pell Center's Story in the Public Square and South County Tourism Council.  Works  * Along with other Narragansett tribal members, Spears also collaborated with artist Holly Ewald and the Tomaquag Indian Memorial Museum to create Through Our Eyes: An Indigenous View of Mashapaug Pond, a book of collage art, including poetry, photography and stamping, that tells the Indigenous history of Mashapaug Pond. * Spears has an essay published in The Pursuit of Happiness: An Indigenous View: The Narragansett People Speak, (2005, by Dawn Dove and other Narragansett authors/artists), entitled \\"Pursuit of Happiness: An Indigenous View on Education.\\" An excerpt from this same essay is also published in Dawnland Voices: An Anthology of Indigenous Writing from New England (editor Siobhan Senier, 2014), along with one of Spears' poems and poems by her young students.  Awards and honors  In June 2005, Spears received the Feinstein Salute to Teachers, Teacher of the Month. In 2006, she earned the Native Heritage Gathering Award. Furthermore, in 2010, Spears was chosen as one of eleven Extraordinary Women honorees for Rhode Island in the area of teaching and education.

The Charter is made up of 12 best practice principles, which cover the sequence of choices faced by governments in relation to resource extraction. These range from how to create the right environment for responsible investment, to fiscal terms, contracts, institutions and regulations, to macroeconomic management and strategies for sustainable development. The Natural Resource Charter has also developed an assessment framework, allowing governments and societies to assess their performance in natural resource governance according to the 12 precepts. In 2012 this assessment framework was piloted in Nigeria by a group of Nigerian civil society specialists on the petroleum sector, leading to the publication of an assessment report with traffic light scoring according to the precepts of the Charter. In 2011 the Charter was adopted by the African Union Heads of State steering committee for the New Partnership for Africa's Development as a flagship Natural Resource Governance Programme starting in 2012.http://www.aercafrica.org/news/spsxiii.asp  History  The Charter document was initially written by a group of leading experts on natural resource governance including Paul Collier, Michael Spence, Robert Conrad and Anthony Venables amongst other senior economists, lawyers and political scientists. It received input from a range of stakeholders during a 12-month public consultation prior to the launch of the Charter in 2010. A second edition was published by the Natural Resource Governance Institute in 2014, with drafting led by Jim Cust and David Manley.https://resourcegovernance.org/sites/default/files/documents/nrcj1193_natural_resource_charter_19.6.14.pdf  People  The Natural Resource Charter is led by an oversight board chaired by former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo, and joined by Abdulatif Al-Hamad, Luisa Diogo, Mo Ibrahim, and Shengman Zhang.

The painting commemorated American politician Jerry Brown's first two terms as Governor of California from 1975 to 1983 and has remained controversial since its unveiling. Style and execution The painting diverged from the formal style that characterises many official paintings of politicians. Brown said of his portrait that it looked \\"unfinished\\" and reflected his \\"unfinished work while in office.\\" The Sacramento Bee, in an online guide to the California State Capitol said that \\"Between calm and conservative portraits of his peers, Brown's face peers out of gray bars and drips of red paint.\\" Critics of the portrait described it as \\"abstract\\", \\"cubist\\" or \\"expressionistic\\", though as the authors of the United States Senate Catalogue of Fine Art wrote \\"Those are merely code words for ‚Äòmodern‚Äô‚Äîindicating not what Brown's portrait is, but what it is not\\", emphasising the fact that the painting is not a classic, formal portrait. The unfinished look of the painting was commented on by Bachardy himself‚Äîhe said that it stemmed from his difficulty in \\"capturing\\" Brown during their five sittings. Of his technique Bachardy said, \\"Some people are restless and I have to get into their rhythm...I‚Äôll just hope to get something essential. You boil it down to the most crucial parts of the face and get the living quality. And sometimes that essence can be achieved in just a few moments.\\" In his journal Stars in My Eyes, Bachardy wrote that he found it difficult working on the portrait because of Brown's \\"defensiveness\\" and apparent unease with the project. Bachardy said the sittings were \\"an ordeal for both of us and made me wish that I could find a way to get my kicks without suffering such stress.\\" Each of the five sittings produced a portrait. It was not until the middle of the fifth and final sitting that Bachardy told Brown how difficult his restlessness was making the work. Brown expressed surprise but then transformed his sitting-style into one of co-operation and stillness to a degree that \\"nearly unnerved\\" the painter. The final portrait, called by Bachardy Jerry Brown V, was completed in about three hours on 2 February 1984. It was agreed to be the best of the five.Bachardy, Don (2011). Stars in My Eyes. University of Wisconsin Press. . pp.245‚Äì262 Bachardy was paid $13,000 ($ today) for the portrait. Reception California legislators described the portrait as looking like \\"spilled ketchup and soy sauce\\", referring to Bachardy's use of broad brush strokes for Brown's orange and red skin tones. The portrait was intended to be hung on the first floor of the California State Capitol with the other gubernatorial portraits, but the Joint Rules Committee of California State Assembly voted that it be displayed on a third- floor stairwell, following an eight-minute debate. The Democratic California legislator Lou Papan said that the portrait was \\"very well done ... it captures a lot of the expressions we all remember\\", to which a fellow Democratic legislator replied, \\"Yeah, like the warmth in his eyes.\\" On the placing of the painting Bachardy remarked that \\"If you saw some of the paintings hanging in the Capitol, you'd see why I am not at all insulted that my portrait of Brown is not among them.\\" References External links *Jerry Brown's portrait on The Governor's Gallery *Stars in My Eyes, \\"Jerry Brown\\" chapter by Don Bachardy, GoogleBooks preview.

Taking power in San'a All the three lines (and definitely the third one) appear to have been descended from the Hamdan tribe, just like the Ismaili Sulayhid dynasty who ruled Yemen and were adherents of the Egyptian Fatimid caliphs.G. Rex Smith, \\"Politische Geschichte des islamischen Jemen bis zur ersten t√ºrkischen Invasion\\", in: Werner Daum, Jemen, Frankfurt a. M. 1987, p. 140. The Sulayhid capital was moved from San'a to Jibla in 1088, and a Hamdan tribesman called Imran bin al-Fadl was appointed governor of the city together with the king's uncle As'ad bin Shihab. When the Sulayhid da'i or leader Saba' bin Ahmad died in 1098, control over San'a passed to the powerful tribal leader Hatim bin al- Ghashim al-Mughallasi who took the title sultan. Hatim established the power of the Hamdanids together with his eldest son Muhammad. However, he soon found reason to kill his son, who was given to murdering beautiful young girls. When Hatim died in 1109, he was therefore succeeded by his second son Abdallah, who was poisoned in 1111. His younger brother Ma'an then came to power. Ma'an was deposed and imprisoned in 1116 by the Qadi Ahmad, son of governor Imran, since he was too weak to uphold authority over the Hamdan sub-tribes. Hisham, al- Humas and Hatim (II), belonging to the al-Qubaib line of the Hamdanids, then maintained power until 1139. Under Hatim there was tribal discord and the people of San'a rose in revolt. The son of qadi Ahmad bin Imran, Hamid ad- Dawla Hatim, entered the city with 700 Hamdani horsemen and was established as sultan. Banu Zuwahi, offered mountain-peak fortress of Kawkaban near San‚Äôaa to Syedna Hatim in 561/1166. San‚Äôaa was under the rule of Sultan Ali b. Hatim al- Yami of the Hamdan tribe. Perceiving a threat to his own sovereignty, Sultan Ali proceeded to lay siege to Kawkaban. A trusted associate of the Dai Ahmad al-Hibri betrayed him. Ahmad al-Hibri accepted a bribe from Sultan Ali, gave him vital information about the Dai‚Äôs arrangements, and persuaded others in Kawkaban to turn against him, and forced Hatim to left Kawkaban. He went to Lu‚Äôlu‚Äôa and Ray‚Äôan, two smaller fortresses some distance away. But Sultan Ali pursued him there with his troops and the Dai‚Äôs reluctance to cause further strife among the Hamdan qabila prompted him to relinquish his hopes for acquiring territories in the San‚Äôaa region. He decided to move to the mountainous Haraz region, where there had been Ismailis from the time of the first Sulayhid ruler. In the next few years a series of successful military expeditions gradually brought most of Haraz under the Dai‚Äôs control. The core of his army was the Ya‚Äôaabir qabila, and their chief Amir Sabaa b. Yusuf. Intervention by Zaydis and Ayyubids After the end of Sulayhid rule in Yemen, the country was split between a number of competing petty dynasties along tribal and religious lines. The Zaidiyyah imamate, extinct since 1066, was revived in the person of al-Mutawakkil Ahmad bin Sulayman. From his base in Sa'dah he marched against San'a in 1150 and defeated Hamid ad-Dawla Hatim, but was unable to secure the city. Hamid ad-Dawla was able to maintain his position until his death in 1161. His son and successor Ali bin Hatim was able to expand the power base of the dynasty in northern Yemen. Military victories alternated with defeats, but in 1173 he allied with the Zurayids of Aden and worsted the religiously deviant Mahdid regime. However, hardly had Ali bin Hatim returned to San'a when a new external threat appeared. The Ayyubid ruler in Egypt, Saladin sent his brother Turan Shah with an army to South Arabia in the same year. When the Ayyubids reached the outskirts of San'a, Ali bin Hatim fled to a mountain fortress, leaving San'a to be captured in August 1174. Thus ended the rule of Fatimid-affiliated dynasties in San'a. Turan Shah occupied Yemen and ruled there until 1181.G. Rex Smith, \\"Politische Geschichte des islamischen Jemen bis zur ersten t√ºrkischen Invasion\\", in: Werner Daum, Jemen, Frankfurt a. M. 1987, p. 142. Ali bin Hatim nevertheless continued to offer periodic resistance until 1197, and was able to hold San'a for long periods when there was no Ayyubid army around. In 1197 he offered his allegiance to the new Zaydiyyah imam al-Mansur Abdallah.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City, London 1983, p. 61.

Background IFISC was created in 2007, as an initiative of the members of the former Cross- Disciplinary Physics Department of the Mediterranean Institute for Advance Studies (IMEDEA). The institute particularly performs research at the border of physics with other disciplines that range from social sciences to natural sciences and information technology. IFISC members develop interdisciplinary research from the physicists‚Äô point of view. To this end, the research methodology comprises the transfer of knowledge, concepts and methods from physics to other well established disciplines. IFISC claims to focus on advanced studies with potential applications, avoiding the polarization between basic and applied science. The research followed by the institute manifests itself in the basis of a transverse line of exploratory nature covering the generic phenomena of nonlinear physics and complex systems, with tools borrowed form Statistical Physics, Dynamical Systems, Information Theory, Computational Methods and Quantum Mechanics. The main research line is complemented by a group of sublines of transfer of knowledge from that line, that include quantum physics and nanoscience, nonlinear photonics and information technologies, geophysical fluids, biocomplex systems and social and socio-technical systems. Since 2012 IFISC has been running a Master program in Complex systems. The program focuses on the fundamental aspects that are necessary to understand the paradigm of complex systems, including training in theoretical, computational and experimental work.

The project, which began in 2009, includes five web documentaries‚ÄîThe Thousandth Tower, Out My Window, One Millionth Tower, A Short History of the Highrise and Universe Within: Digital Lives in the Global Highrise‚Äîas well as more than 20 derivative projects such as public art exhibits and live performances. In March 2013, the NFB and The New York Times announced a partnership entitled A Short History of the Highrise, which resulted in four short documentaries about life in highrise buildings, utilizing images from the newspaper's photo archives for the first three films, and user-submitted images for the final film. Until mid-2015, Cizek collaborated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's OpenDocLab unit on developments for the Highrise project as part of MIT's Visiting Artists Program. In June 2015, Universe Within: Digital Lives in the Global Highrise was launched as the final installment of Highrise. In addition to awards won by individual webdocs in the series, the Highrise project received the Canadian Urban Institute's 2013 Global City and Innovation Urban Leadership Award. The total budget for Highrise was CAD$2.8 million. The Thousandth Tower (2010) The first production in Highrise is a citizen media project by six residents in a multi-cultural highrise complex in the Toronto neighbourhood of Rexdale. Project participants were found after a year of research and worked closely with facilitators: Heather Frise, Maria-Saroja Ponnambalam and Katerina Cizek. Residents were provided with digital cameras and a blog and met weekly with filmmakers over a six-month period for training in lighting techniques and writing. The residential complex was a test site in the City of Toronto's plan to renovate and beautify highrise residences. Release The Thousandth Tower premiered May 12, 2010 at an event at Toronto City Hall. Out My Window (2010) Out My Window is a web documentary exploring the lives of families living in high-rise buildings in 13 cities around the world. The website is produced by National Film Board of Canada as part its collaborative documentary project Highrise. Out My Window was shot in Chicago, Toronto, Montreal, Havana, S√£o Paulo, Amsterdam, Prague, Istanbul, Beirut, Bangalore, Phnom Penh, Tainan, and Johannesburg. Cizek spent one year researching the project prior to starting production in August 2009. To locate characters and stories, Cizek and a team of researchers (Heather Frise, Maria- Saroja Ponnambalam, Paramita Nath) worked with a network of journalists, filmmakers and photographers around the world, directing them remotely from Toronto via email and Skype. However, not all communication was so instantaneous: a story from Havana had to be hand-delivered by the photographer, months after it was commissioned, without the chance for any direction from Cizek. Overall, 22 stories had been commissioned, with 9 stories dropped for various reasons during the production process. Photos were digitally combined to create 360-degree scenes, in which viewers can explore the lives of apartment inhabitants, browsing interiors or navigating deeper to view embedded stories. Imaginarius, a Kitchener, Ontario-based multimedia production company, collaborated with Highrise Technical Director Branden Bratuhin and worked with over 1,000 photos to produce the 360-degree effect. In Toronto, Amsterdam and Havana, Cizek also used a five-lens, 360-degree camera created by Amsterdam-based tech company Yellowbird to shoot interactive music video sequences. Release The site went live in October 2010. Out My Window was also presented at International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in November 2010. It has also been licensed to the SBS Australia website. Awards Out My Window received the inaugural IDFA DocLab Award for Digital Storytelling. In April 2011, it received the International Digital Emmy Award in the category of digital program: non-fiction. In April 2011, the web documentary was nominated for a Webby Award for Best Use of Photography in the Websites category. On May 10, 2011, Out My Window received the New Media Award at the One World Media Awards. One Millionth Tower (2011) One Millionth Tower is a 2011 NFB interactive web documentary by Katerina Cizek that gives people living in residential skyscrapers the opportunity to work with architects and animators to reimagine their homes in 3D virtual space. The project focuses on two high-rise apartment buildings in Etobicoke. The webdoc allows users to navigate through their high-rise neighborhood, displaying the current state of urban decay, then activating features to show how residents would change their world, such as an animation showing where a new playground or garden would go. One Millionth Tower also features images from Flickr, Google Street Views and real-time weather data from Yahoo. According to transmedia creator Anita Ondine Smith, NFB interactive projects like One Millionth Tower are helping to position Canada as a major player in digital storytelling. One Millionth Tower was originally planned by Cizek as a linear animated documentary about reinvigorating urban housing complexes, showcasing residents‚Äô ideas for improving their homes in the tower, but evolved into an interactive project in 3-D space. One Millionth Tower was influenced by the NFB's Challenge for Change program for participatory media, which put media creation into the hands of citizens in the 1960s and 70s. Technology One Millionth Tower was created using HTML5, WebGL, Three.js and other open source JavaScript libraries, and utilizes Mozilla Foundation's Popcorn.js technology to add interactivity to its online videos. Utilizing Mozilla's Web-based graphics library, One Millionth Tower is the first 3D web documentary to not require an Adobe Flash plug-in. Release One Millionth Tower premiered simultaneously on Wired.com and the Mozilla Festival in London on November 5, 2011. Beginning January 2012, excerpts were being screened in Toronto subway stations. Awards One Millionth Tower was named Best Original Program Produced for Digital Media, Non-Fiction at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards. A Short History of the Highrise (2013) A Short History of the Highrise is an interactive documentary that \\"explores the 2,500-year global history of vertical living and issues of social equality in an increasingly urbanized world.\\" The centerpiece of the project is four short films: Mud, Concrete and Glass have been created with images from The New York Times's visual archives, while a fourth film, Home, is being made with user- submitted images. The interactive site will incorporate the films and also offer additional archival materials, text and microgames. The series is produced by Op-Docs, the Times' editorial department's forum for short, opinionated documentaries, and the NFB, as part of its HIGHRISE project. Release A Short History of the Highrise premiered as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center‚Äôs New York Film Festival Convergence program on September 30, 2013 and online at NYTimes.com in October. Awards In April 2014, it received a Peabody Award.73rd Annual Peabody Awards, May 2014. In June 2014, it received the Sheffield Innovation Award from the 2014 Sheffield Doc/Fest. In the fall of 2014, it received a News and Documentary Emmy Award. In February 2015, A Short History of the Highrise was named Best Original Program or Series produced for Digital Media - Non-Fiction at the 3rd Canadian Screen Awards. Universe Within: Digital Lives in the Global Highrise (2015) The final installment, Universe Within: Digital Lives in the Global Highrise, is an interactive look at how residents in highrise buildings around the world connect online. The U.S. premiere was hosted by CityLab. The project hired 14 residents in a Toronto highrise complex who went door-to-door to neighbors about their digital lives, and found that 80% of households had Internet access either at home or through their mobile device, despite their low-income status. This led Cizek to conclude that \\"there‚Äôs a real, invisible story here that we‚Äôre not seeing in the media or even in academic literature about how the digital maps out in the vertical, so we went to over 20 locations around the world, to speak with [people] ‚Äì through local journalists and photographers ‚Äì and to find stories of how the digital and the vertical intersect in really intimate, personal and political ways.\\" Universe Within users are asked to choose between three avatars who discuss their own personal histories and guide viewers through the story based on their input. Cizek has called the project is what the director calls \\"a whole larger than the sum\\" of previous Highrise installments, combining the international aspects of previous projects with deeper community-based research. Universe Within incorporates research by Deborah Cowen, an associate professor of geography at the University of Toronto and colleague Emily Paradis, a senior research associate whose work focuses on economic disparity, to look at how residents in low-income highrises use technology to combat isolation and the digital divide. Stories include a person with ALS in Tokyo, an ex-convict in Harlem, a Saudi woman comic and a UN-sponsored refugee in Toronto, as well as residents in Worli, a Mumbai neighbourhood, who resist the expropriation of their homes in the Campa Cola Compound. Universe Within took Cizek and the NFB four years to make and cost CAD $628,000. Technology Cizek has stated that Universe Within is the most technologically advanced of all the Highrise projects, using point cloud data to create the avatars through a collaboration with Highrise Technical Director Branden Bratuhin and Toronto-based digital agency, Secret Location. Awards On March 8, 2016, Universe Within received the award for Best Original Interactive Production Produced for Digital Media at the 4th Canadian Screen Awards. At the 2016 Webby Awards, Universe Within received the Webby for Online Film & Video/Best Use of Interactive Video.

The two married at the end of that year, resulting in their excommunication; they eventually emigrated from Italy to the United Kingdom before finally settling in Mexico. Negrini later moved back to the United States, where she lived for the rest of her life. Early life Negrini (n√©e Young) was born on June 21, 1930 in Cincinnati, Ohio. She was the daughter of James J. Young, a professor at Loyola University, and Eileen Brady Young. She grew up in Chicago. She met Luciano Negrini, the man who would become her husband, when he was in Chicago; the two were taking voice lessons from the same teacher. Luciano Negrini was a missionary in China, and had been sent to the United States by his bishop to raise funds to continue their work. Young fell in love with Negrini, and asked him to marry her many times, but he initially refused, sticking to his vows as a priest. According to Young, her father was more accepting of the romance, but her mother was strongly opposed. However, her father also attempted to block the marriage by arranging for a psychiatric assessment of his daughter, in hopes that she would be found irrational and mentally incapable of contracting a marriage. Young eventually travelled to Italy with Negrini, where the two moved into his aunt's apartment in Milan. In April, she visited the U.S. consulate in an attempt to renounce her U.S. citizenship, but foreign service officers told her that she would have to wait. Her bid for statelessness was an effort to avoid expulsion from the country, as with no means of support she could have been deported back to the United States. Arrest In late July 1951, Young went to the Milan police headquarters to extend her visitor's permit, which was set to expire on 5 August; however, she was instead arrested and held at San Vittore Prison. One report stated this was \\"for reasons of public security\\". Another said that she had been charged with insulting a public official. Still another report said that she had falsified her birthdate in an official document and was being held for deportation. Negrini attempted to visit her to deliver a package of food, but police would not permit her to see him. He later sent his aunt, who was informed that police would release Young within a few days. He even offered to sit in jail on her behalf so that she could go free, but this was rebuffed. Around the same time, Negrini revealed that he had been laicized. To make ends meet, he took a job as a travelling salesman with a Bologna necktie company. The couple's plight resulted in news coverage across the United States, and a sympathetic reverend at the Central Church of Christ in Salem, Oregon even called Negrini personally to offer him a job as his assistant, but Negrini turned it down because his fianc√©e was happy to remain in Italy. Young was released from jail a few days later; deputy police chief Gabriele Mundo stated that an Italian psychiatrist had examined Young and found her \\"sane in mind and body\\", and that no charges would be pressed. Marriage paperwork Young's troubles did not end with her release from prison. Her residence permit had been extended, but she still needed to complete paperwork in order to marry, which could take up to two weeks. In order to complete the formalities, she would have to provide her birth certificate and other documents. She applied to the U.S. consulate for the necessary paperwork, but by earlier September they had failed to deliver it. In an attempt to get around the paperwork requirements, she asked a Milan court for a formal declaration that she was a stateless person. With the ongoing delays, she wrote a letter to U.S. President Harry Truman asking him to determine whether or not she was stateless; she needed a certificate of citizenship status in order to proceed with the marriage. By November, the paperwork was still pending, and Young had to obtain another extension of her permit of stay. In the meantime, she made a living by giving English lessons. In the end, the court declared her stateless, and her license to wed was finally granted in December. The two were married in December 1951 in a civil ceremony at Milan's City Hall. As a result of getting married in a civil ceremony rather than a church ceremony, both were excommunicated according to Catholic canon law at the time. Under Italian nationality law at the time, she became an Italian citizen through her marriage to Negrini. Emigration from Italy and later life A few months after they were married, the newlywed Negrini couple moved to the United Kingdom, looking for employment as domestic workers in the London area; however, according to friends, neither was suited to that kind of job and quit within a week, and afterwards they had encountered difficulty obtaining permission to engage in other employment due to the country's strict controls on work permits for foreigners. In June 1952, their first son Italo Negrini was born at King's College Hospital in London. From London, the Negrini family moved to Chihuahua in Mexico at the invitation of an unnamed Santa Barbara, California organization; the organization had previously hoped to bring them to the United States, but her renunciation of U.S. citizenship meant that this was not possible. In May 1953, the couple had their second son in Mexico. Negrini eventually moved back to the United States. Her fourth son, opera singer Gualtiero Negrini, was born in Los Angeles, California in 1961. She died at her home in Los Angeles on February 16, 2006. Her husband preceded her in death. She was survived by her four sons, five grandchildren, and a great-grandson. Her funeral was held at St. Francis of Assisi, and she was interred at the San Fernando Mission Cemetery.

Work Cella is an advocate of artist books as a medium and has curated numerous exhibitions with and about artist books. He has stated that a good art book can replace a visit to a museum, because it offers many possibilities for discourse and experimentation., Cella about his project \\"collecting books\\" With projects like Collecting Books, Salon f√ºr Kunstbuch or Kunstbuch*Kompass, he changes the perception of the viewer towards the books that are included in the project. He often uses unusual re-arrangements to disorient the viewers in their viewing habits. His works shift modes of production and distribution of current forms of visual art; in this way he operated as a businessman-artist, who transcends the barriers between business and art. He has made artworks that operate also as a fashion studio, a hotel and a museum shop. In his project \\"and. learning English has no use\\" he used reproductions of his artworks to overcome language barriers that he encountered during a stay in Nanjing, where he used the aesthetics to create modes of communication to make it possible for him and the Chinese students to work together. The students reproduced his artworks, and by this a direct form of communication was developed between them. In 2012, he was invited by artist AA Bronson and Printed Matter Inc. for the New York Art Book Fair, where he showed Austrian art books and publications in the MoMa/PS1. , MOMA PS1 Artbookfair 2012, Press release about Cellas Participation at the NY Art Book Fair His lectures were held in institutions like the University of Arts and Industrial Design Linz,http://www.ufg.ac.at/Archiv.3898+M5187f16dcdd.0.html?&tx;_ttnews[pS]=1359822028&tx;_ttnews[pointer]=4 the print room in Amsterdam, the Galerie f√ºr Zeitgen√∂ssische Kunst Leipzig,http://www.foto- graphic.de/Joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=407%3Aleipzig- salon-fuer-kunstbuch-&Itemid;=132 and the √ñ1 of the Castle Sigharting.http://library.getty.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=365378 He collaborates with many curators and artists, including Diana Baldon , Cella collaborated with Curator Diana Baldon and Franz West./blog/cat/salon/post/west/], Cella's Collaboration with Franz West Curator His curatorial practice is focused mainly on exhibiting books. He has curated the following exhibitions about artbooks: \\"Revolver - Archiv f√ºr aktuelle Kunst Frankfurt\\", \\"7 Schweiz - 195 K√ºnstlerb√ºcher\\",\\"14 x NL in 1070\\", 35 books from London, COLLECTING BOOKS - FOCUS ON AUSTRIA, \\"K√ºnstlerb√ºcher aus der T√ºrkei\\" and \\"MIT Care-Paket. 30 kg Kunsttheorie aus Amerika\\".http://www.kunsthallewien.at/cgi- bin/event/event.pl?id=3805;lang=de;back=3648 Salon f√ºr Kunstbuch In 2007 Cella founded the Salon f√ºr Kunstbuch (Salon for Artbooks), a work of art that appears to be a bookstore, but is actually a 1:1 scale model of a bookstore.http://www.fwf.ac.at/de/abstracts/abstract.asp?L=D&PROJ;=AR146 It is dedicated to showing the work of international practitioners from the sphere of artist's books. Books are exhibited and only sometimes sold there, as some of the books are only part of the current exhibition. The project shifts the viewing habits of the visitors, by using performative and sculptural actions. The printed matter is presented using a cumulative method that uses formats like rotating exhibitions, performative readings and lectures that are organized together with other artists, curators and philosophers. The Salon f√ºr Kunstbuch has hosted talks by Sabeth Buchmann, Elisabeth Samsonov, Bureau for Open Culture and the Grazer Autorenversammlung. In 2011 the Austrian Gallery Belvedere, a public institution, bought the work for the newly opened venue 21er Haus. Since then the Salon f√ºr Kunstbuch operates as the museum's shop and as a steadily changing sculptural and performative intervention in the foyer of the 21er Haus. With the \\"Salon f√ºr Kunstbuch im 21er Haus\\" questions about the status of museum shops since the '80s and the representation of the museum through the range of a shop are stated. Currently he is the first and only artist in Austria who can teach commercial apprentices in the bookstore sector. Collections His works are in the collections of museums and private collections like the Belvedere, the art collection of Salzburg, the art collection of lower Austria, the collection of Nikos Alexiou, the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Albertina, the Museum f√ºr angewandte Kunst Wien, the Van Abbemuseum, the museum in progress and the J.

They were introduced by Paul Dirac in 1930 and John von Neumann in 1932. Hilbert space formulation The space \\\\mathbb{H} is a fixed complex Hilbert space of countable infinite dimension. *The observables of a quantum system are defined to be the (possibly unbounded) self-adjoint operators A on \\\\mathbb{H} . *A state \\\\psi of the quantum system is a unit vector of \\\\mathbb{H}, up to scalar multiples. *The expectation value of an observable A for a system in a state \\\\psi is given by the inner product \\\\langle \\\\psi, A \\\\psi \\\\rangle. Operator algebra formulation The Dirac‚Äìvon Neumann axioms can be formulated in terms of a C* algebra as follows. *The bounded observables of the quantum mechanical system are defined to be the self- adjoint elements of the C* algebra. *The states of the quantum mechanical system are defined to be the states of the C* algebra (in other words the normalized positive linear functionals \\\\omega). *The value \\\\omega (A) of a state \\\\omega on an element A is the expectation value of the observable A if the quantum system is in the state \\\\omega. Example If the C* algebra is the algebra of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space \\\\mathbb{H}, then the bounded observables are just the bounded self-adjoint operators on \\\\mathbb{H}. If v is a unit vector of \\\\mathbb{H} then \\\\omega (A) = \\\\langle v, A v \\\\rangle is a state on the C* algebra, meaning the unit vectors (up to scalar multiplication) give the states of the system. This is similar to Dirac's formulation of quantum mechanics, though Dirac also allowed unbounded operators, and did not distinguish clearly between self-adjoint and Hermitian operators.

Collins served four terms in the Arkansas House of Representatives for District 84, which encompasses part of Washington County near Fayetteville. In 2014, Collins briefly sought the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas. Following reelection in 2016, Collins sponsored legislation to allow anyone over age 21 to carry guns on college campuses and other public places. Controversial among the University of Arkansas community within District 84, Collins lost his reelection bid in 2018. Biography Early life He graduated from Franklin High School in Livonia, Michigan. He graduated in 1985 from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He received a master's degree in 1986 in quantitative economics from George Washington University in Washington, D.C.Crown Partners Executive Search, LLC Career He started his career at Procter & Gamble in 1990 as a brand manager in Cincinnati, Ohio. He came to Arkansas in 1996. He later worked for Eastman Kodak as vice president of sales, as team leader at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club, and as vice president of the H. J. Heinz Company in Arkansas. In 2005, he joined Crown Partners Executive Search, LLC, a recruiting and consulting firm. State Representative He has served as a state representative for District 84 since 2011 and he was re-elected in 2012 and 2014.Arkansas House of Representatives biography Sarah Villegas, Charlie Collins Wins Re-election, The Arkansas Traveler, November 7, 2012 The position was formerly District 89 and held by a Democrat Jim House, who Collins defeated in 2010. During his first term, he was a member of the House Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development Committee, the House Revenue and Taxation Committee, and the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee, where he was vice chair of the Subcommittee on Educational Institutions. In his second term, he is a member of the Legislative Joint Audit Committee, Insurance and Commerce Committee, and Chairman of the House Revenue and Taxation Committee. Collins had planned to run for lieutenant governor in the May 2014 Republican primary election. He would have faced U.S. Representative Tim Griffin of Arkansas' 2nd congressional district and legislative colleagues Andy Mayberry of District 27 in Saline County and Debra Hobbs of District 94 in Benton County. However, in February 2014, Collins ended his lieutenant governor campaign and announced that he will instead seek reelection to the state House of Representatives. He has also proposed a bill to reduce the state income tax.Max Brantley, Charlie Collins' plan to make the rich much richer , Arkansas Times, March 1, 2013 =Act 562 of 2017= Sign posted on UA campus pursuant to Act 562 of 2017 In the 92nd Arkansas General Assembly, Collins sponsored a bill to allow faculty at public universities (including the University of Arkansas within District 84) to use concealed carry handguns on campus as long as they have a Firearms license.Max Brantley, UPDATE: Committee endorses Charlie Collins' bill to allow guns on campus, Arkansas Times, February 12, 2013 The bill caused major debates on the state‚Äôs open carry law and the Second Amendment. Every public college opposed the bill, including UA Chancellor Joseph E. Steinmetz. Gun advocates in the Arkansas General Assembly succeeded in expanding Collins' initial proposal to almost all public places, including the courthouses, bars, churches, and sporting events. The expanded measure ultimately became law as Act 562 of 2017, with exemptions for sporting events, the state hospital, and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). Collins was unseated in his bid for a fifth legislative term in the general election held on November 6, 2018.

It was founded by Martin Ahlquist, Lars Grafstr√∂m, Karin Pettersson and Martin √Ödahl. Its first publishing was in December 2005. In 2007, it was awarded the Swedish Publicists' Association's grand prize. The magazine publishes 41 issues per year and has a circulation of approximately 31,000. Fokus is editorially politically unbound. The magazine is owned and published by FPG Media, a Swedish limited company. The paper's office is situated at Wallingatan in Stockholm. History Fokus was founded in 2005 by Martin Ahlquist, Martin √Ödahl, Lars Grafstr√∂m and Karin Pettersson. Their ambition was to create a Swedish magazine equivalent of Time or Newsweek. In search for a financier for the magazine they turned to the chairman of the Ax:son Johnson investment company Nordstjernan and former editor-in-chief of Veckans Aff√§rer, Johan Bj√∂rkman. After much convincing, Bj√∂rkman, agreed to finance Fokus through Nordstjernan. In mid-2005, the company FPG Media was formed to manage Fokus and the founders began recruiting journalists. A few months later the first issue of Fokus was published on Friday December 2, 2005. When the founders plans for Fokus were announced many lauded the project as an interesting idea, but at the same time most analysts declared it doomed to fail. Sweden was seen as too small a country for a weekly news magazine. It would be hard to build an audience, when the Swedish daily newspapers already were very strong and of good quality. Furthermore, the high rate of English proficiency among the target Swedish audience would mean that the magazine would have to compete with well established English-language newsmagazines.  Ownership  The magazine is owned and published by FPG Media, a Swedish limited company (aktiebolag), where the major share holders are Nordstjernan, the Johan Bj√∂rkman Foundation, and Tagehus. These companies are in turn mainly controlled and owned by the prominent Swedish business family Ax:son Johnson. In March 2013, the trade magazine Resum√© reported that despite increasing circulation Fokus had made a projected loss of approximately 88 million SEK from 2005 until 2012. However, Viveca Ax:son Johnson, the chairwoman of Nordstjernan, commented that they were committed to Fokus for a much longer time than seven years. Together with the culture and science television station Axess TV, the magazine is seen as a prestige project for the Ax:son Johnson family, and they are prepared to invest money in it from other sectors of their business empire.  Content  Fokus aims to cover the most important issues of every week in politics, science, economics and culture. The goal of the magazine is to give a greater comprehension and explanation of current affairs. The magazine covers both domestic and foreign issues. Each weekly issue reaches news vendors and subscribers on Friday mornings. Each issue typically contains in-depth articles on politics and economics, two or more chronicles, a longer interview and a portrait of a politician, a sport star, a business profile, a writer, a researcher or a philosopher, as well as coverage and reviews of culture. Fokus is editorially politically unbound. The magazine does not align itself with the political left or right, however it takes a stand for the values of humanism, internationalism, and rationalism. Most of the Fokus' content is also published online, on fokus.se. In April 2013, the magazine announced that it would start charging non-subscribers for access to its online content.  Rankings  Every year, Fokus ranks the best universities in Sweden, the most powerful Swedes, the best municipalities to live in and the most successful municipalities in terms of social integration. In determining the most desirable municipalities to live in, at least 30 factors are taken into account, including such things as the quality of schools, healthcare, and crime and unemployment rates. Habo, Lomma, Danderyd, and Lund have all been ranked as most desirable to live in, while Haparanda, Ljusnarsberg, and Munkfors have been ranked as least desirable. The rankings usually garner attention in other news media. They have also been criticised, for example in a book by written the local-politician Magnus Nilsson and published by the think-thank Timbro, for favouring small homogenous municipalities situated near larger cities. Fokus editor Martin Ahlquist has stated that the ranking should not been see as an evaluation of the work of local politicians, but rather as a guide for citizens and that it is therefore natural that some municipalities are favoured by their location.  Collaborations  In 2007, the wiki Makthavare.se was created by Fokus. The wiki was used in Fokus annual listings of the year's most powerful Swedes. From 2009 until 2012, Fokus operated Makthavare.se together with the blog Almedalsbloggen (owned by Inre Kabinettet AB). However, since May 2012, Makthavare.se is fully owned by Inre Kabinettet AB and Fokus is no longer involved in the operation of the wiki. Fokus collaborates with the French news magazine Le Point on coverage of international news.

History The organization was established in 1954 by the advertising specialist and creative professional Alex F. Osborn,CEF website: History who was known as the inventor of the term and the creativity technique of Brainstorming. As an early contribution according to its mission statement the organization held in 1955 the first annual Creative Problem Solving Institute (CPSI), an international creativity conference, at the University of Buffalo.ICSC-website For years the organization had been directed by Alex Osborn together with the creativity theorist and education researcher Sid Parnes. When Alex Osborn died in 1966, Parnes took over the initiative and the chair. He installed the lifetime creative achievement award which was granted upon suggestion to persons who earned outstanding merits in the field of applied creativity. Also he installed a media-program of CEF- publications. In 1987 John Meyerhoff took over as the CEO. He expanded CEF‚Äôs educational perspective to include business training. Further CEOs added partnership programs and VIP-days and reinstalled CEF consulting and training programs. Work In the beginning the focus relied on organizing the annual conference, evolving and applying creativity tools and techniques which can be used professionally and personally, conducting research in the field of applied creativity, problem solving and innovation, publishing books and teaching materials, and in the development of a comprehensive educational program which includes creativity specifically for scholars and young people. As a part of its research aspirations, in 1967, the organization launched the Journal of Creative Behavior (JCB), a peer-reviewed first research publication devoted to the science of creativity, published by Wiley-Blackwell. Later, in 1972 it was followed by Creativity in Action, CEF‚Äôs monthly newsletter. Since 1979 the CPSI-conference has offered four major program streams: Springboard for novices, Leadership Development Program, CPSI YouthWise, and Extending sessions for exploratory studies. Since 1989 the organization sponsored creativity conferences in the CPSI-sense on different continents promote creativity and creative education; it started with the first Australian CPSI and was later followed by the South African ACRE-conference (since 1994) and the European CREA-conference (since 2003). In 2003 the CEF YouthWise-program was launched in South Africa, and in 2011 the Creativity in the 21st Century Classroom course enhanced the CPSI program. Today the goals of CEF span a range of fostering creativity and giftedness including dialogue, serious play and training programs, conferences, programs, publications and other services in order to pursue the idea of creativity as human capacity which can be developed and nurtured. The CPS Process Central to the Creative Education Foundation is their belief in the CPS Process. The steps are clarify, ideate, develop and implement; while the core principles include convergent and divergent thinking must be balanced, ask problems as questions, suspend judgement, and focus on \\"yes and...\\" rather than \\"no, but...\\". Research The Journal of Creative Behavior: CEF publishes a quarterly academic citing research in creative thinking titled, \\"The Journal of Creative Behavior\\". Edited by Ronald A. Beghetto from the University of Connecticut, the journal deals with methods to foster creative productivity, giftedness, management of creative personnel, testing, creativity in business and industry, development of creative curricula, creativity in the arts and sciences, and reviews of literature on creativity and problem solving. The content also focuses on the creative process. After self-publishing 45 volumes since 1967, the Journal of Creative Behavior moved to Wiley-Blackwell, a commercial publisher of academic journals.

He was a major landowner, a Marcher lord with large holdings in Shropshire, where he was the Lord of Oswestry, as well as in Norfolk and Sussex. He took the side of Empress Matilda during the Anarchy and underwent considerable hardship in the Angevin cause before regaining his lands and former status. William's younger brother, Walter fitz Alan (d. 1177), became ancestor of the royal House of Stuart. Background and early life William was born around 1105. He was the eldest son and heir of Alan fitz Flaad, a Breton noble whose family were closely associated with the sacred environs of Dol-de-Bretagne, close to the border with Normandy and a short distance south-west of the great abbey of Mont Saint-Michel. Alan was a close ally of Henry I of England (1100-1135), who was determined to insert reliable supporters into strategically key areas after the disloyalty of Robert of Bell√™me, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, who had a strong support network in the Marches. Alan received extensive fiefs in Shropshire and Norfolk from around the beginning of Henry's reign and more as he proved his worth. Much of the Shropshire land was taken from the holdings of Rainald de Bailleul, ancestor of the House of Balliol, as was land around Peppering, near Arundel in Sussex. William's mother was Avelina de Hesdin. Her father was Ernulf de Hesdin (also transcribed as Arnulf), a crusader baron from Hesdin in Artois, which was a fief of the County of Flanders and only loosely attached to France. Ernulf built up large holdings in Staffordshire and Gloucestershire. After his death in the First Crusade, Avelina's brother, also called Ernulf, inherited his lands and titles. Baron and rebel William succeeded his father around 1114, probably still aged under 10. He was appointed the High Sheriff of Shropshire by Adeliza of Louvain, the second wife of Henry I. His first notable appearance is as a witness to King Stephen's charter to Shrewsbury Abbey in 1136. As Sheriff of the county, William was also castellan of Shrewsbury Castle. In 1138, he joined in the revolt against Stephen and garrisoned the castle against the king. After resisting the attacks of the royal army for a month, he fled with his family in August 1138, leaving the castle to be defended by his uncle, Ernulf de Hesdin. When the town fell, Stephen acted in anger, hanging Ernulf and 93 others immediately, frightening the local people and magnates into transferring their allegiance to him. William was deprived of his lands and titles and spent the next fifteen years in exile, until the accession of Henry II to power in place of Stephen in 1153-4. He was a close supporter of the Angevin cause, accompanying the Empress or her son on numerous occasions. He was present with Empress Matilda at Oxford in the summer of 1141, and shortly after at the siege of Winchester Castle. He remained in attendance on her at Devizes, witnessing the charter addressed to himself by which she grants Aston to Shrewsbury Abbey. In June 1153 he was present with Henry FitzEmpress, then Duke of Normandy, at Leicester. It was during this period that his younger brother, Walter, used the family's royal connections to make a new career in Scotland under David I of Scotland, an uncle of the Empress. William's active support did not end with Henry's accession to the throne. In July 1155, when the king marched against Hugh de Mortimer, a turbulent Marcher lord who had been a key supporter of Stephen, and recaptured the castles at Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth, William FitzAlan was the chief beneficiary. At Bridgnorth ‚Äòthe king restored his lands‚Äô and William there received the feudal homage of his tenants. Thus he regained his paternal fief. He was also restored as High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1155, holding the post until his death in 1160. Benefactor It was probably between 1130 and 1138 that FitzAlan made the first recorded grant to Haughmond Abbey: a fishery at Preston Boats on the River Severn, near Shrewsbury. It is possible that there was a hermitage or a small religious community at Haughmond even in his father's time, and a small church from this earlier period has been revealed by excavations on the site, so it is not clear that William was the founder of the abbey. However, it was he who set it on a secure financial basis, with a series of important land grants in Shropshire and Sussex, which were reciprocated by other magnates in the region. Haughmond received lands from the Empress, confirmed by Stephen and Henry II. William continued to make benefactions to it when he returned from exile, including the wealthy portionary church of Wroxeter, declaring his intention to increase the number of priests there too. He also made grants to nearby Lilleshall Abbey, another Augustinian house. Though not the founder of Wombridge Priory, a smaller Augustinian house, he sanctioned its foundation by the Hadley family, his vassals. It was, however, Haughmond that became the FitzAlan shrine, with all heads of the family after William buried there for a century and a half. Death and burial William died around Easter 1160. He was buried at Shrewsbury Abbey, according to Eyton, noted in the Haughmond Abbey history (\\"After William FitzAlan (I), who left his body for burial in Shrewsbury Abbey\\"). Family and heritage William's first wife was Christiana. She was the niece of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I, and thus cousin to William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester, who was a principal supporter of the Empress. She was the mother of his heir and other children. :* William's eldest son and heir was also called William FitzAlan. :* Christiana, their daughter married Hugh Pantulf, 4th Baron of Wem, a later High Sheriff of Shropshire. His wife Christiana died before William regained his ancestral estates in 1155. Henry II therefore gave him the hand of Isabel de Say. She was the sole heiress of Helias de Say, who held the lordship of Clun and was an early benefactor of Haughmond Abbey. Clun was to pass to the FitzAlans on the death of Helias, but he outlived William, so it passed to his son, the second William. Isabel brought prestige as well as land. The FitzAlans remained important Marcher lords and magnates in central England for several centuries. A strategic marriage with their Sussex neighbours, the d'Aubigny family, brought the FitzAlans the rich and important Earldom of Arundel. This they held from 1243 until 1580. It was as earls of Arundel that William FitzAlan's descendants made their most important mark on the history of England. In literature The taking of Shrewsbury in 1138 by King Stephen, including the escape of William FitzAlan and the hanging of the supporters who did not escape, was the historical background for the novel One Corpse Too Many by Ellis Peters. Agents of FitzAlan are characters in a few of the later novels in The Cadfael Chronicles.

Since the album never came out in stores due to the band's departure from the label, it served a starting point for We The Ghost. As the band stated in an interview with Urban Tulsa Weekly, they were text messaging each other band name ideas and somehow settled on the name merely because of time constraints before the upcoming radio interview that would ultimately introduce the band to the Tulsa, OK market.Concert review: We the Ghost at Queen City Music Hall  Star-Telegram.comhttp://entertainmentdrivethru.com/we- the-ghost/  Formation (2012‚Äì2016)  We The Ghost formed in their original incarnation in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2011 but officially announced their formation in January 2012. Originally performing under the name The Sweet Carolina, singer and songwriter Beau Tyler and djimbe player Dain Samuelson, who had been best friends since grade school, added Jimmy Dean Adams on the bass guitar with the original intent of performing as an acoustic trio. However, as the vision quickly grew beyond the limitations of an acoustic trio, Jimmy Adams transitioned from bass guitar to drums as the band changed their name to We The Ghost, developed a new sound more in line with Tyler's original vision, and added guitarist Matt McHan and violinist Jocelyn Rowland to the lineup. The group played their first show on January 27, 2012, in Tulsa, OK at Fisbonz as main support for the band RadioRadio.http://tulsa.eventful.com/events/we-ghost-/E0-001-044401810-7 Until January 2014, when bassist Calvin Berkenbile joined the band, We The Ghost performed with a series of hired bass players for public performances.

The following statement was issued:http://www.wetheghostmusic.com/news/we-were-ghosts-a-farewell-message \\"So this is it. The most bittersweet message we've ever had to write. While we are all still best friends/family and will undoubtedly continue playing with one another in future projects, we have decided to call curtains for We The Ghost. We know that many of you were expecting another album, but sadly that will not be happening. Honestly, the fire that is needed to go through the recording process and everything that goes along with promoting the record just isn't there any longer. It happens. To us, we feel like it means that we've said everything we wanted to say. Now, we are all excited for our next musical endeavors (we will keep you all updated). In the last 6 years we have released 5 albums, traveled across the country to sold-out shows, made some amazing friends (you), heard our songs on TV shows and radio stations across the U.S., have looked in awe as we saw our name on the Billboard charts, and won awards we hardly felt worthy of winning. We have done absolutely everything we set out to do and so much more, but if we are being honest, while we are so proud of what we‚Äôve all accomplished together, we are far more grateful for the amazing experiences we‚Äôve shared with one another as people. Here's the thing about ghosts. They're all just souls searching for something to set them free. Fortunately, the members of this band found each other in the moments of our lives when we needed each other the most. While together as a band we have endured divorces and experienced the joy of marriage. We have lost parents and seen the birth of our children. We have battled everything from depression to addiction and have come out on top every single time for one reason; we‚Äôve had one another to overcome everything and each time we‚Äôve come out on the other side as better people. While I'll always cherish the music we‚Äôve made as much as any music I'll ever release, nothing will ever matter more to me than the relationships we‚Äôve all built with one another. Before we sign out, I'd like to leave you with a lyric from the final WTG song I ever wrote, as the lyrics seem fitting: ‚ÄúSometimes something has to die so that it can stay beautiful. Sometimes, when you‚Äôve said everything you have to say, the only thing left is silence.‚Äù So that's it. From the bottom of our jet black hearts, thank you. Peace, Love, & Music. Beau Tyler We The Ghost\\"  Reformation and New Music (2018 - Current)  On March 22, 2018 after over 17 months since the band last shared a stage together a cryptic post was made across the band's website and social networks that simply said \\"WTG: 2012 to...\\". Additionally, on the homepage of We The Ghost's website, a Friends themed meme was posted with the character of Ross that stated: \\"When in doubt yell: we were on a break.\\" This quickly led to speculation of a reunion. No official confirmation or denial has yet been made by the band.http://www.wetheghostmusic.com/ On March 31, 2018 the band's social networks and website were reactivated. Additionally, the band made yet another, yet less cryptic post via their Facebook profile and website promising \\"huge news\\" to be announced soon.

This is truly a giant creative leap forward for a band that many had thought already hit their stride.\\"http://approachmusic.com/2018/05/we-the-ghost-with- someone-like-you/ Reception from fans were equally positive. While the song was not available for official download until May 11th, 2018, the song had quietly and without promotion been posted to the band's SoundCloud page for 2 weeks and gained over 6,000 streams, as well as hundreds of reposts and likes prior to the official release.https://soundcloud.com/wetheghost/with-someone- like-you Only 9 days later, on May 20th, 2018, We The Ghost unexpectedly announced the release of yet another single set to be released on June 1st, 2018, entitled \\"I'm On Fire\\". The band's website stated \\"Our new song \\"I'm On Fire\\" would be available everywhere music is streamed or downloaded.

It had been revealed that We The Ghost had parted ways with founding member, Matt McHan, and was moving forward as a 4 piece band. The message, written by lead singer/songwriter Beau Tyler, stated the following: \\"So in 2018, we released 4 new songs through all of the streaming services out there. It was our first batch of songs since our 2016 album \\"A Stereophonic Listening Experience\\". While we loved getting back together again to make music with each other, we're even more excited to tell you this...WE ARE BACK! We're working on new songs and will be returning to the stage within the next few months! There will be some changes, which anyone who knows We The Ghost should always expect lol. Our ability to roll with the punches is really the only reason we've been able to stay around for this long (8 years... wow!). That being said, we are super sad to say that our best friend and co-founder Matt McHan as decided to step down from his post and focus on his life outside of music. While there were plenty of tears when we heard the news, we also know that the other 3 founding members Jocelyn Rowland Khalaf, Dain Samuelson, and myself are all still here and still have a passion for creating music together. As long as that passion and close bond is there, I'm not sure we will ever stop. While things might never be exactly the way that they were, we're are confident that we will once again be able to turn lemons into lemonade... or pizza... or chocolate milk. You know, something awesome. Now I want chocolate milk. That's all for now. We love you all and can't wait to see you soon. Stay tuned! Viva La Ghost, Beau Tyler We The Ghost\\".https://www.wetheghostmusic.com/ While originally DJ Kylie Wells was listed as a member of the band as of July 2019 the long-time friend and collaborator DJ Jankins, AKA Anferni Jankins, has recently been listed on the band's website as the newest member of the band.

Together with Thomas Savage, he was one of the trustees used by the original shareholders of the Globe Theatre in the allocation of their shares in 1599. Later, Leveson was involved in the suppression of the Essex rebellion on 8 February 1601. In 1613 he was sued by the Virginia Company. Family William Leveson was a younger son of Thomas Leveson (1532‚Äì1576),William Leveson (d.1621) is sometimes confused with his uncle, William Leveson (d. 1593), a younger brother of Thomas Leveson (1532‚Äì1576); he was also a member of the Mercers Company, and married Barbara Chapman; ; . second son of the London mercer Nicholas Leveson (d.1539) by Denise or Dionyse Bodley (d.1561), youngest daughter of Thomas Bodley (d.1493) and Joan Leche (d. March 1530).; . His mother was Ursula Gresham (1534‚Äì1574), one of the twelve children of Sir John Gresham, Lord Mayor of London.. Leveson had an elder brother, Sir John Leveson,. who played a key role in the suppression of the rebellion of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, on 8 February 1601.; . Career Leveson traded for twenty years as a merchant. He was a member of the Mercers' Company, the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, and the Company of Merchants for the Discovery of Regions Unknown.. Leveson experienced difficulty in being admitted to the Merchant Adventurers; in 1586 the Privy Council sent a letter to the Company urging Leveson's admission on the ground that he had been apprenticed to Robert Roe, one of the Company's members, and had committed no fault.. According to Honigmann, a lawsuit in the Court of Requests in 1592 between William Leveson, mercer, and William Chapman, salter, and Roger James and his son of the same name, brewers, indicates that Leveson was 'already operating on a large scale in 1592'.. In 1595 Leveson was imprisoned on the complaint of Richard Carmarden, Surveyor of Customs for the Port of London. When Carmarden's officers confiscated Leveson's packs, Leveson and others beat the officers and uttered 'wild words' against the Queen's authority. Leveson was released from custody after begging pardon and paying costs.; . According to Honigmann, it was about this time that Sir Robert Cecil began to use Leveson as the recipient of letters from foreign informants. Letters intended for Cecil were addressed to 'Mr William Lewson, merchant, at London'.'Cecil Papers: January 1596, 1-15', Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, Volume 6: 1596 (1895), pp. 1-14 Retrieved 14 April 2013.'Cecil Papers: January 1596, 16-31', Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, Volume 6: 1596 (1895), pp. 14-43 Retrieved 14 April 2013. Honigmann suggests that Leveson perhaps came to Cecil's attention at this time through Leveson's cousin, William Waad, Clerk of the Privy Council. In 1599 Leveson was one of two trustees used by William Kempe, Thomas Pope (d.1603), Augustine Phillips (d.1605), John Heminges (bap. 1566, d. 1630) and William Shakespeare (1564-1616) to allocate shareholdings in the Globe Theatre. At the time, Leveson was churchwarden in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury. Later, he resided in Philip Lane 'over against the great Digges mansion'.; ; . Leveson was involved in the suppression of the rebellion of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex on 8 February 1601. As a reward, Leveson asked Queen Elizabeth to grant him the lease of the Golden Key in Cheapside, a property owned by the Mercers' Company. The Queen supported his request with a letter to the Mercers,. but in the end Leveson did not obtain the lease.'St. Pancras Soper Lane 145/10', Historical gazetteer of London before the Great Fire: Cheapside; parishes of All Hallows Honey Lane, St Martin Pomary, St Mary le Bow, St Mary Colechurch and St Pancras Soper Lane (1987), pp. 691-704 Retrieved 9 April 2013. In 1607 Leveson raised funds for the Virginia Company, and is said to have collected 'great sums' for it.. In 1613, as receiver of moneys raised in the Company's lottery, he was the subject of a lawsuit by the Company, which filed a Bill of Complaint in the High Court of Chancery on 15 November 1613,Virginia Company vs. William Leveson, Bill of Complaint, 15 November 1613, Records of the Virginia Company of London, University of Virginia Library Retrieved 9 April 2013. to which Leveson responded by an Answer dated 30 November 1613.Virginia Company vs. William Leveson, The Answer of William Leveson to the Bill of Complaint, 30 November 1613, Records of the Virginia Company of London, University of Virginia Library Retrieved 9 April 2013.

(1985). The Modernizers: overseas students, foreign employees, and Meiji Japan, p. 47. Biography Munenori was the younger son of Matsudaira Chikakiyo, who was the fourth son of Matsudaira Naonori of Shirakawa Domain. Naonori was in turn the son of Matsudaira Naomoto of Himeji Domain, who was in turn the fifth son of Fukui domain's founder, Y≈´ki Hideyasu. His childhood name was Senjir≈ç (ÂçÉÊ¨°ÈÉé). In 1712, he was selected by Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshimune to become heir to Fukui Domain, and was wed to a daughter of Matsudaira Yoshikuni. He became daimy≈ç in 1724 on the death of Matsudaira Munemasa. He underwent the genpuku ceremony in 1726 and his name was changed to Hyob≈ç-daisuke Munenori at that time, taking one kanji each from the names of Tokugawa Yoshimune and Matsudaira Munemasa. He also gained the court rank was Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. In 1733, he gained the courtesy title of Sakon'e-gon-sh≈çj≈ç. Under his tenure, extensive reforms were taken to root out corruption and to provide disaster relief for people suffering from crop failure or destitution. Munenori stressed fiscal restraint, and came down strongly on tax evasion by merchants. He also focused on forestry, especially the planting of lacquer trees, and improvements to the domain‚Äôs port at Mikuni. He also managed to have all the tenry≈ç territories in Echizen Province placed under the administration of Fukui Domain, for which he received a percentage of their revenues. For these efforts, he is recognized as one of the best rulers of Fukui during the Edo period; however, his efforts were not enough to place the domain on sound financial footing, and a demand that he oversee the shogunal pilgrimage to the Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ in 1743 was also a severe financial setback. He was a patron of the arts.Kita, Sandy. (1999). The Last Tosa: Iwasa Katsumochi Matabei, Bridge to Ukiyo-e, p. 238. He died in Edo in 1749 at the age of 35, without natural heir.

It is his second album dedicated to a poet, after Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal in 1957. Here, Ferr√© focuses on former surrealist Louis Aragon, but the body of work he chooses (poetry collection Le Roman inachev√©, mostly) is not surrealistic. This album had much more impact than Ferr√©'s first Baudelaire effort, maybe because when it was published Ferr√© was gaining both success and critical acclaim on stage, and Aragon was an active poet and a controversial committed communist figure in the French intellectual field. History L√©o Ferr√© began to set Louis Aragon's poems to music in the fall of 1958Alain Raemackers, album La Mauvaise Graine booklet, La M√©moire et la Mer, 2006. and completed the task in March 1959. At that time, Ferr√© was not under contract to a record label. After several refusals, Ferr√© ended up signing with Eddie Barclay in 1960. Barclay was sceptical about sung poetry and asked him to release an album of catchier middle-of-the-road tunes before he would release the Aragon record. Ferr√© obliged by recording the album Paname, which included classics such as \\"Paname\\" and \\"Jolie m√¥me\\". Les Chansons d'Aragon was finally recorded in January 1961 and released in February 1961.. The finished album lists only 10 of the original 12 compositions. Ferr√© changed most of the original titles, and sometimes eliminated some verses or changed their order. Aragon, who was greatly impressed by Ferr√©‚Äôs adaptations, wrote a liner text wherein he recognized Ferr√© as a true poet and claimed that \\"the literary history of France [would] have to be re-written a little differently because of the contribution made by L√©o Ferr√©\\". This album is a landmark and is considered as an evergreen classic of the French song repertoire. Track listing Texts by Louis Aragon. Music composed by L√©o Ferr√©.

It is commonly sold in the British port towns of Hartlepool, Kingston upon Hull, Wirral, Liverpool, North Tyneside, Kirkwall and Thurso and subsequently Troon after the arrival of Jill Rosie. It is a popular item in fish and chip shops, and is consumed either as a snack or as an inexpensive substitute for fish in a fish and chip meal. There are additional pattie variations such as the meat pattie (corned beef) and the cheese pattie (cheese and onion), although these are not as popular as the savoury version. In certain parts of the North East and Cumbria fish patties are available also known as fish fritters. These consist of a disc of minced fish sandwiched by two slices of potato (rather than mashed potato as in other patties) and covered in batter. Patties can be of various shapes but are usually round or rectangular. In Hull it may be consumed in a breadcake; this is known as the pattie buttie. When the patties were prepared on an industrial scale in Yorkshire, they were often made by women in white coats and white wellies. The women became known locally as Pattie Slappers and they had a reputation that you shouldn't argue with them. A study into the lives of the Pattie Slappers was created into a memory project with Heritage Lottery Funding in 2012. A version of the pattie appeared as one of the dishes served up in a heat of Masterchef in 2015, and Ricky Gervais tried one on the BBC programme The One Show after taking the advice of Jill Rosie.

(1985). The Modernizers: overseas students, foreign employees, and Meiji Japan, p. 47. He ruled Fukui for 41 years, the longest of any daimy≈ç of Fukui Domain. Biography Shigetomi was born in Edo as the third son of Tokugawa Munetada, founder of the Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa family, one of the Gosanky≈ç, the three lesser branches of the Tokugawa clan. His childhood name was Senchiy≈ç (‰ªôÂçÉ‰ª£) later become Sennosuke (‰ªô‰πãÂä©). On the death of his elder half-brother, Matsudaira Shigemasa of Fukui Domain in 1758, he was posthumously adopted as heir and became daimy≈ç. In 1760 he underwent the genpuku ceremony and received a character from Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieshige‚Äôs name to become Matsudaira Shigetomi. During his tenure, he attempted to make fiscal reforms; however, damage caused by heavy snow, fires, windstorms, flood and epidemics in consecutive years thwarted his efforts, and the domain‚Äôs finances continued to deteriorate. Shigetomi was also accustomed to a luxurious lifestyle from his youth in the Hitotsubashi household. As revenues ran out, he imposed special taxes on the rice merchants to maintain these luxuries. This resulted in higher rice prices and great public dissatisfaction, cumulating in a massive riot in Fukui in 1768. Unable to suppress the rebellion, the domain officials were forced to agree to public demands, and to dispose of corrupt officials and merchants. As a close relative of the shogunal house Shigetomi was uncle to Tokugawa Ienari, the domain was able to call on the central government for financial assistance. However, the Great Tenmei famine hit the domain hard. Shigetomi made rapeseed a domain monopoly in 1790, and salt in 1799. In 1799, he retired from public life in favor of his son. He also used his status to revive the honorary status of the domain, raising his court rank from Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade to Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade and his courtesy title from Sakon'e-gon-sh≈çj≈ç to Sakon'e-gon-ch≈´j≈ç. He was married to a daughter of Tokugawa Munenobu of Kii Domain. His graves are at the clan temple of Kaian-ji in Shinagawa Tokyo and Unsh≈ç-ji in Fukui.

The start of the drain is the outflow of the Crowle sewage treatment works; from there it flows in an eastwardly direction, south of the village of Eastoft before it reaches the Paupers pumping station at the side of the tidal River Trent, to the north of Amcotts. The station contains three pumps, which are used to maintain water levels in the drain by discharging water into the Trent as required.
