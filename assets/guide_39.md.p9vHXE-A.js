It is about north of Gwalior and about east of Morena town. The temples are mostly small and spread over about site. They are dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Shakti - representing the three major traditions within Hinduism. The site is within the Chambal River valley ravines, on the north-western slope of a hill near Padavali known for its major medieval era Vishnu temple. The Bateshwar temples were built between the 8th and the 10th-century. The site is likely named after the Bhuteshvar Temple, the largest Shiva temple at the site. It is also referred to as Batesvar temples site or Batesara temples site. The temples as they now appear are in many cases reconstructed from the fallen stones in a project begun by the Archaeological Survey of India in 2005. History According to Madhya Pradesh Directorate of Archaeology, this group of 200 temples were built during the reign of Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty. According to Michael Meister, an art historian and a professor specializing in Indian temple architecture, the earliest temples in the Bateshwar group near Gwalior are likely from the 750-800 CE period.Michael W. Meister (1976), Construction and Conception: Ma·πá·∏çapikƒÅ Shrines of Central India, East and West, Vol. 26, No. 3/4 (September - December 1976), page 415, Figure 21 caption, context: 409-418 The temples were destroyed after the 13th century; it is not clear if this was by an earthquake, or Muslim forces. The site was visited and its ruins reported by Alexander Cunningham in 1882 as a \\"collection of more than 100 temples large and small to the southeast of Paravali Padavali\\", the latter with a \\"very fine old temple\\".Eastern Rajputana Tour Report, A Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, Volume XX, pages 107, 110-112 Bateshwar was notified by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a protected site in 1920. Limited recovery, standardized temple numbering, ruins isolation with photography, and site conservation effort was initiated during the colonial British era. Several scholars studied the site and included them in their reports. For example, the French archeologist Odette Viennot published a paper in 1968 that included a discussion and photographs of the numbered Batesvar temples.O. VIENNOT (1968), Le probl√®me des temples √† toit plat dans l'Inde du Nord, Arts Asiatiques, Vol. 18 (1968), √âcole fran√ßaise d‚ÄôExtr√™me-Orient, pages 40-51 with Figures 50, 53-56, 76, 80-82 and 88 context: 23-84 (in French) In 2005, the ASI began an ambitious project to collect all the ruins, reassemble them and restore as many temples as possible, under an initiative led by the ASI Bhopal region's Superintending Archaeologist K.K. Muhammed. Under Muhammed's leadership, some 60 temples were restored. Muhammed has continued to campaign for the site's further restoration and calls it \\"my place of pilgrimage. I come here once in every three months. I am passionate about this temple complex.\\" According to Muhammed, the Bateshwar complex was \\"built on the architectural principles enunciated in two Sanskrit Hindu temple architecture texts, Manasara Shilpa Shastra composed in the 4th century CE, and Mayamata Vastu Shastra written in the 7th century CE\\". He followed these texts as his team of over 50 workers collected pieces of the ruins from the site and like a jigsaw puzzle tried to put it back together. The site has been a \\"massive mounds of rubble\\" of temple parts, states Subramanian, with \\"ruins lying everywhere\\". Dacoit Nirbhay Singh Gujjar and his gang helped Archaeological Survey of India restore the temple complex. Description The site is mentioned in historical literature as Dharon or Paravali, later as Padavali. The local name for the group of temples is Batesvar or Bateshwar temples. Three illustrative floor plans found at the Batesvar site in Madhya Pradesh. According to the Cunningham's report of 1882, the site was a \\"confused assemblage of more than one hundred temples of various sizes, but mostly small\\". The largest standing temple was of Shiva, wrote Cunningham, and the temple was locally called Bhutesvara. However, to his surprise the temple had a relief of Garuda on top, leading him to speculate that the temple may have been a Vishnu temple before it was damaged and reused. The Bhutesvara temple had a square sanctum with a side, with a relatively small 20 square feet mahamandapa. The sanctum doorway was flanked by river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna. The tower superstructure was a pyramidal square starting off from a sided square seated on a flat roof, then rhythmically tapering off. The standing temples, stated Cunningham, all had sides made from single slabs set upright, above which sat flat roofs then pyramidal top as a part of their architecture. The site had a water tank cut into the hill rock, with rows of small temples arranged to form a street to the tank. Cunningham also reported seeing Shiva linga inside one of the temples, a trimurti statue, a Ganesha, Shiva and Parvati together around this temple. Next to the Shiva temple was a Vishnu temple, about the same size as the Siva temple, again a square sanctum of side with river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna flanking the doorway on its jambs. In north-northeast corner of the site was a large platform of about length and breadth, with an integrated platform projection of a square with side. Cunningham speculated that this may have been the largest temple at the Bateshvara site before its destruction, and he noted that not a stone remains near the platform to offer further clues as to what the lost temple was like. Cunningham also noted that one of the small temples to the northwest of the Bhuteshwara temple had a short inscription dated Samvat 1107 (1050 CE), thus establishing the floruit for the site. The ASI team ruins identification and restoration efforts since 2005 have yielded the following additional information about the site: *Some of the temples had a Nataraja on the kirti-mukha *Reliefs with \\"exquisite carving\\" of Lakulisa *Reliefs of Siva holding the hand of Parvati *Reliefs narrating the legend of Kalyana-sundaram, or the marriage of Shiva and Parvati with Vishnu, Brahma and others attending *Small sculptures of women playing the lute, veena or drums in Vishnu temples, suggesting that music profession in pre-11th century India encouraged women to participate as musicians *Amorous couples in various stages of courtship and intimacy (mithuna, kama scenes) *Secular scenes such as men riding elephants, men wrestling, lions *Friezes with narratives from the Bhagavata Purana such as Krishna leela scenes such as Devaki holding baby Krishna who is suckling her breasts in prison that is guarded by a woman; Baby Krishna draining away the life of the demon with poisoned breasts, etc. According to Gerd Mevissen, the Batesvar temples complex has many interesting lintels, such as one with Navagraha, many with Dashavatara (ten avatars of Vishnu) of the Vaishnavism tradition, frequent display of Saptamatrikas (seven mothers) from the Shaktism tradition. The presence of Navagraha lintel suggests, states Mevissen, that the temple complex must be dated after 600 CE. The diversity of the theological themese at the site suggest that Batesvar (also called Batesara) was once a hub for temple-related arts and artists. Significance According to Michael Meister, the Bateshwar site illustrates the conception and construction of \\"Mandapika shrine\\" concept in central India. It is reducing the Hindu temple idea to its basics, in a simple concept that is one step further from the single cave cell design. This design has roots in more ancient Hindu temples found in this region such as one that survives at Mahua and has a Sanskrit inscription that calls the design as sila mandapika (literally, a \\"stone pandal or pavilion\\". This has vedi-platform roots that combines the traditional square plan with various combinations of Hindu temple architecture elements. The temples explore a square sanctum mounted on a basement platform (jagati) that is rectangular, states Meister, so as to incorporate a small praggriva (porch). These temples have a \\"simple pillared wall topped by a broad, flat-edged awning which extends beyond the sanctum to shade the entry as well. The square pillars rest directly on the vedibandha, and are crowned by \\"leaf capitals, their shafts engraved with decorative medallions. At its best this type has a very individual and decorative quality, still like a wooden or ivory box, intervening bands of meandering foliage especially vital, the whole framed by the flat, deeply shadowed vedibandha mouldings and the crisp chadya (with saw-tooth edge) above\\", according to Meister. The significance of these temples is that they fuse and experiment with a variety of temple building ideas, such as topping the nagara sikharas that may have been dominant by that time possibly in western India, on the simplest of temple grid plans with more ancient roots in central India.Michael W.

NSC was one of the first commercially available highly available clustering solutions for commodity hardware. Description NSC provided a full single-system image cluster: ;Process migration:Processes started on any node in the cluster could be migrated to any other node. Migration could be either manual or automatic (for load balancing). ;Single process space:All processes were visible from all nodes in the cluster. The standard Unix process management commands (ps, kill and so on) were used for process management. ;Single root:All files and directories were available from all nodes of the cluster ;Single I/O space:All I/O devices were available from any node in the cluster. The normal device naming convention was modified to add a node number to all device names. For example, the second serial port on node 3 would be \`/dev/tty01h.3\`. A partition on a SCSI disk on node 2 might be \`/dev/rdsk/n2c3b0t4d0s3\`. ;Single IPC space:The standard UnixWare IPC mechanisms (shared memory, semaphores, message queues, Unix domain sockets) were all available for communication between processes running on any node. ;Cluster virtual IP address:NSC provided a single IP address for access to the cluster from other systems. Incoming connections were load-balanced between the available cluster nodes. The NSC system was designed for high availability‚Äîall system services were either redundant or would fail-over from one node to another in the advent of a node crash. The disk subsystem was either accessible from multiple nodes (using a Fibre Channel SAN or dual- ported SCSI) or used cross-node mirroring in a similar fashion to DRBD. History NSC was developed for Tandem by Locus Computing Corporation based on their Transparent Network Computing technology. During the lifetime of the project Locus were acquired by Platinum Technology Inc. The NSC team and product were then transferred to Tandem. Initially NSC was developed for the Compaq Integrity XC packaged cluster, consisting of between two and six Compaq ProLiant servers and one or two Compaq ServerNet switches to provide the cluster interconnect inter-node communication path. In this form NSC was commercialized by Compaq and only supported on qualified hardware from Compaq, and later Fujitsu-Siemens. In 2000 NSC was modified to allow standard Fast Ethernet and later Gigabit Ethernet switches as the cluster interconnect and commercialized by SCO as UnixWare NonStop Clusters 7.1.1+IP. This release of NSC was available on commodity PC hardware, although SCO recommended that systems with more than two nodes used the ServerNet interconnect. After the sale of the SCO Unix business to Caldera Systems it was announced that the long-term goal was to integrate the NSC product into the base UnixWare code but this was not to be, Caldera Systems ceased distribution of NSC, replacing it by the Reliant HA clustering solution and in May 2001 Compaq announced that it would release a GPLed version of the NSC code, which eventually became OpenSSI.

He was also a physician. Biography Brady was son of Thomas Brady, an attorney of Denver, Norfolk. He was educated in Downham Market and at Caius College, Cambridge. He was made Master of Caius College in 1660, on the English Restoration. In the 1670s, he hoped to write for the prominent politicians Joseph Williamson and Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, but they declined the offer. It was only when William Sancroft became Archbishop of Canterbury that Brady found a patron. Beginning in 1677, Brady held the position of Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge. He sat as Member of Parliament for the University in 1681 and 1685.Concise Dictionary of National Biography In historical controversy, he was opposed to William Petyt and James Tyrrell, along what would become Tory versus Whig lines, then forming in the Exclusion crisis of the 1680s. Brady is regarded as holding to an uncompromising royalist position. Others on the Whig side were William Atwood, Edward Cooke, and Sir John Somers. J. P. Kenyon takes him as a pioneer among the royalist scholars of English medieval history, who were working towards a formulation akin to our contemporary view. John Pocock regards as \\"unforgettably damaging\\" the effect the (proto)-Tory Brady and others made, in attacking the doctrine of the \\"Ancient Constitution\\" as a failed description of the real circumstances of political arrangements in the England of the Middle Ages. On the narrow point of the actual legal effects of the Norman Conquest, Brady had been anticipated by Samuel Daniel, in views that are quite close to modern scholars.Patrick Wormald, The Making of English Law: King Alfred to the Twelfth Century (2001), p. 8 . He moved from there to argue for absolutism, and that Magna Carta was not a major charter for popular freedom. Brady's ideas drew on Henry Spelman and Robert Filmer.Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article pp. 117‚Äì8. David C. Douglas remarks that although his motivations as a scholar were at least as political as those of his opponents, his techniques were so far superior that his work remained of importance.David C. Douglas, English Scholars (1939), p. 155. Brady was aided in his later work by a position from 1686 in the archives of the Tower of London.

The ship begins each round with a limited supply of fuel (40 points) which is consumed as the player uses thrusters to pilot the craft. The game ends as a loss if the player's ship runs out of fuel, collides with an asteroid or runs too quickly into the mothership. If the ship reaches the mothership and successfully enters the docking port, the player wins the round and a new one begins with more densely grouped asteroids. The game presents the player with two views of the playing area ‚Äî one from above and one from the side.

The library's main building is located in the historical Clementinum building in the centre of Prague, where approximately half of its books are kept. The other half of the collection is stored in the district of Hostiva≈ô. The National Library is the biggest library in the Czech Republic, housing around 6 million documents. The library currently has around 20,000 registered readers. Although comprising mostly Czech texts, the library also stores older material from Turkey, Iran and India. The library also houses books for Charles University in Prague. History In the 13th century, the Studium generale school was founded in the Dominican monastery in Prague's Old Town. This school, including its library, merged with the university in the 14th century. In 1556, monks of the Jesuit Order erected a boarding school, named Clementinum, on the remains of the Dominican monastery. From 1622 on, the Jesuits also administrated the Charles University, and all their libraries were accommodated in the Clementinum. East entrance of the Clementinum After the suppression of the Jesuits, the university became a state institution in 1773, and in 1777 its library was declared \\"Imperial-Royal Public and University Library\\" by Maria Theresa. Even after the splitting of the university into a Czech and a German university in 1882, the library remained as a joint institution. In 1918, the Public and University Library was taken over by the government of the newly founded Czechoslovakia. In 1924, the Slavonic Library (Slovansk√° knihovna) was founded, and moved to the Clementinum in 1929; it is still an autonomous part of the National Library. In 1935, the library was renamed \\"National and University Library\\" (N√°rodn√≠ a univerzitn√≠ knihovna). In the same year, a law on the legal deposit copy duty was introduced ‚Äì a practice dating back to 1781, when Prague printers had to hand in legal deposit copies of their prints to the library. Although Czech universities and colleges were closed after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, the library remained open under the name of \\"Municipal and University Library\\" (Zemsk√° a univerzitn√≠ knihovna). In 1958, all large Prague libraries were merged into the single centralized State Library of the Czechoslovak Republic (St√°tn√≠ knihovna CSR). In 1990, the hitherto last renaming of the library resulted in its current name: National Library of the Czech Republic. A new storage building, the Central Depository in Hostiva≈ô, was inaugurated in 1996. Collections The most precious medieval manuscripts preserved in the National Library are the Codex Vyssegradensis and the Passional of Abbes Kunigunde. Digitisation The National Library of the Czech Republic began with their digitisation efforts in 1992 in collaboration with the Czech company AiP Beroun. In these efforts, the National Library conducted pioneer work on a global scale in the creation of digitization standards. Later, it got involved in a number of European projects, in which it came to additional developments particularly standards regarding manuscripts and old prints. It also supported several pilot projects at the time of their creation and the first years of the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme (with the programme's first pilot project being from the National Library of the Czech Republic in 1993). The library won international recognition in 2005 as it received the inaugural Jikji Prize from UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme for its efforts in digitising old texts. In its first 13 years since 1992, the project accomplished the digitisation of 1,700 documents and made them publicly available. The National Library makes its digital content available in the digital libraries Manuscriptorium (http://www.manuscriptorium.com/en) and Kramerius (http://kramerius5.nkp.cz). Manuscriptorium comprises more than 111,000 manuscripts and old prints, with almost 84,000 of them contributed by the National Library and the remainder from 138 partners from 24 countries. Since 2008, when Europeana, the European Union's digital platform for cultural heritage, came into existence, Manuscriptorium contributes manuscripts and old prints digitised by libraries all over the Czech Republic and by other partners to the Europeana platform and several other specialised portals, including professional academic Resource Discovery services, e.g. of EBSCO, ProQuest and ExLibris. In a collaborative project with Google, additional old prints and early 19th century books from the Slavonic Library have been digitised, with altogether more than 177,000 books digitised by Google (as of October 2018). These books are accessible through the Google Books digital library as well as through the National Library's Catalogue of Old Prints and the Catalogue of the Slavonic Library, and the old prints gradually also through Manuscriptorium. The Kramerius digital library contains digitised documents published after the year 1800. So far, more than 2,000 periodical series have been digitised. The number of digitized books continues to grow, especially after mass digitization of modern prints in context of the National Digital Library project. Proposed new building General reading room (former refectory of the Jesuit residence in Clementinum) In 2006 the Czech parliament approved funding for the construction of a new library building on Letna plain, between Hradƒçansk√° metro station and Sparta Prague's football ground, Letn√° stadium. In March 2007, following a request for tender, Czech architect Jan Kaplick√Ω was selected by a jury to undertake the project, with a projected completion date of 2011. Later in 2007 the project was delayed following objections regarding its proposed location from government officials including Prague Mayor Pavel B√©m and President V√°clav Klaus. Plans for the building had still not been decided in February 2008, with the matter being referred to the Office for the Protection of Competition in order to determine if the tender had been won fairly. Later in 2008, Minister of Culture V√°clav Jehliƒçka announced the end of the project, following a ruling from the European Commission that the tender process had not been carried out legally. Incidents The library was affected by the 2002 European floods, with some documents moved to upper levels to avoid the excess water. Over 4,000 books were removed from the library in July 2011 following flooding in parts of the main building. There was a fire at the library in December 2012, but nobody was injured in the event.

Based on Samaresh Basu's 1965 controversial novel Calcutta, Unabashed, Bibar deals with the angst of city youth in Calcutta, who are caught between the lures of a new, liberalized society and fast-fading traditional values.  Plot  Biresh Bose (Subrat Dutta) works in a finance company IIDB as an investigating officer who prepares the investigation reports on which the loans are sanctioned. The company has provided him a pick up and drop car and he gets a handsome salary. At heart, he is a bohemian with no rigid values in life. He is a regular drinker. He visits the bar every evening. One such evening at the bar he meets Nita, a high-society call girl Nita (Tannishtha Chatterjee), with whom he is caught in a psycho-sexual relationship. After that Biresh starts visiting Nita's apartment regularly and gradually he started feeling peculiar attraction for Nita. Biresh has a friend name Hiren(Shiladitya Patronobish), who is a painter. He lives in with his model Iti (Payel Sarkar). One evening Hiren takes Biresh to Sonagachi brothel, the infamous red-light area of Calcutta. There Biresh comes to know that Hiren was a regular visitor of that area. He gets attracted towards Iti. In his office, his position becomes bleak as he refuses a loan to an influential person, Haralal Bhattacharya (Kunal Mitra), an NRI who applied for loan in Biresh's company. Biresh while investigating found that Haralal's claim was false. So in his report, he stated that Haralal is not eligible for any loan. That ultimately creates problems in Biresh's life. Being an NRI, Haralal had an enormous connection in the upper level. So Biresh was asked by his superiors to change his investigation report, so that Haralal could get the loan. One day Iti visits Biresh's office and tells him that Hiren has left her. She needs Biresh's help. Biresh came to know that Haralal was a regular visitor to Nita's place those days. Biresh finds Haralal in disturbing not only his office life but also his personal life. Biresh, in a bout of self-destruction, vents his anger and frustration by strangling Nita and stages his alibi through Iti. The police start investigating but are unable to establish any motive behind the killing. Police investigator (Sabyasachi Chakraborty) suspects him but cannot not prove him guilty. Iti tells the police that when Nita was killed Biresh was in her apartment the whole night. Everybody starts believing that Haralal might killed Nita. Biresh's company decided that not to give loan to Haralal. Life become smooth for Biresh again, but Nita still haunts him. So one day he calls the police and confesses about the murder of Nita.

Although his existence remains unclear and no writings by him survive, numerous tales credited to him were gathered across the centuries and in many languages in a storytelling tradition that continues to this day. Many of the tales are characterized by animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve problems, and generally have human characteristics. Scattered details of Aesop's life can be found in ancient sources, including Aristotle, Herodotus, and Plutarch. An ancient literary work called The Aesop Romance tells an episodic, probably highly fictional version of his life, including the traditional description of him as a strikingly ugly slave () who by his cleverness acquires freedom and becomes an adviser to kings and city-states. Older spellings of his name have included Esop(e) and Isope. Depictions of Aesop in popular culture over the last 2500 years have included many works of art and his appearance as a character in numerous books, films, plays, and television programs. Life A woodcut of Aesop surrounded by events from his life from La vida del Ysopet con sus fabulas historiadas (Spain, 1489) The earliest Greek sources, including Aristotle, indicate that Aesop was born around 620 BCE in Thrace at a site on the Black Sea coast which would later become the city Mesembria. A number of later writers from the Roman imperial period (including Phaedrus, who adapted the fables into Latin) say that he was born in Phrygia.Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World (hereafter BNP) 1:256. The 3rd- century poet Callimachus called him \\"Aesop of Sardis,\\"Callimachus. Iambus 2 (Loeb fragment 192) and the later writer Maximus of Tyre called him \\"the sage of Lydia.\\"Maximus of Tyre, Oration 36.1 From AristotleAristotle. Rhetoric 2.20 . and HerodotusHerodotus. Histories 2.134 . we learn that Aesop was a slave in Samos and that his masters were first a man named Xanthus and then a man named Iadmon; that he must eventually have been freed, because he argued as an advocate for a wealthy Samian; and that he met his end in the city of Delphi. PlutarchPlutarch. On the Delays of Divine Vengeance; Banquet of the Seven Sages; Life of Solon. tells us that Aesop had come to Delphi on a diplomatic mission from King Croesus of Lydia, that he insulted the Delphians, was sentenced to death on a trumped-up charge of temple theft, and was thrown from a cliff (after which the Delphians suffered pestilence and famine). Before this fatal episode, Aesop met with Periander of Corinth, where Plutarch has him dining with the Seven Sages of Greece, sitting beside his friend Solon, whom he had met in Sardis. (Leslie Kurke suggests that Aesop himself \\"was a popular contender for inclusion\\" in the list of Seven Sages.)Kurke 2010, p. 135. Problems of chronological reconciliation dating the death of Aesop and the reign of Croesus led the Aesop scholar (and compiler of the Perry Index) Ben Edwin Perry in 1965 to conclude that \\"everything in the ancient testimony about Aesop that pertains to his associations with either Croesus or with any of the so-called Seven Wise Men of Greece must be reckoned as literary fiction,\\" and Perry likewise dismissed Aesop's death in Delphi as legendary;Perry, Ben Edwin. Introduction to Babrius and Phaedrus, pp. xxxviii‚Äìxlv. but subsequent research has established that a possible diplomatic mission for Croesus and a visit to Periander \\"are consistent with the year of Aesop's death.\\"BNP 1:256. Still problematic is the story by Phaedrus which has Aesop in Athens, telling the fable of the frogs who asked for a king, during the reign of Peisistratos, which occurred decades after the presumed date of Aesop's death.Phaedrus 1.2 The Aesop Romance Along with the scattered references in the ancient sources regarding the life and death of Aesop, there is a highly fictional biography now commonly called The Aesop Romance (also known as the Vita or The Life of Aesop or The Book of Xanthus the Philosopher and Aesop His Slave), \\"an anonymous work of Greek popular literature composed around the second century of our era ... Like The Alexander Romance, The Aesop Romance became a folkbook, a work that belonged to no one, and the occasional writer felt free to modify as it might suit him.\\"William Hansen, review of Vita Aesopi: Ueberlieferung, Sprach und Edition einer fruehbyzantinischen Fassung des Aesopromans by Grammatiki A. Karla in Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2004.09.39 . Multiple, sometimes contradictory, versions of this work exist. The earliest known version was probably composed in the 1st century CE, but the story may have circulated in different versions for centuries before it was committed to writing,Leslie Kurke, \\"Aesop and the Contestation of Delphic Authority\\", in The Cultures Within Ancient Greek Culture: Contact, Conflict, Collaboration, ed. Carol Dougherty and Leslie Kurke, p. 77. and certain elements can be shown to originate in the 4th century BCE.Fran√ßois Lissarrague, \\"Aesop, Between Man and Beast: Ancient Portraits and Illustrations\\", in Not the Classical Ideal: Athens and the Construction of the Other in Greek Art, ed. Beth Cohen (hereafter, Lissarrague), p. 133. Scholars long dismissed any historical or biographical validity in The Aesop Romance; widespread study of the work began only toward the end of the 20th century. In The Aesop Romance, Aesop is a slave of Phrygian origin on the island of Samos, and extremely ugly. At first he lacks the power of speech, but after showing kindness to a priestess of Isis, is granted by the goddess not only speech but a gift for clever storytelling, which he uses alternately to assist and confound his master, Xanthus, embarrassing the philosopher in front of his students and even sleeping with his wife. After interpreting a portent for the people of Samos, Aesop is given his freedom and acts as an emissary between the Samians and King Croesus. Later he travels to the courts of Lycurgus of Babylon and Nectanabo of Egypt ‚Äì both imaginary rulers ‚Äì in a section that appears to borrow heavily from the romance of Ahiqar.Lissarrague, p. 113. The story ends with Aesop's journey to Delphi, where he angers the citizens by telling insulting fables, is sentenced to death and, after cursing the people of Delphi, is forced to jump to his death. Fabulist Francis Barlow in the 1687 edition of Aesop's Fables with His Life Aesop may not have written his fables. The Aesop Romance claims that he wrote them down and deposited them in the library of Croesus; Herodotus calls Aesop a \\"writer of fables\\" and Aristophanes speaks of \\"reading\\" Aesop,BNP 1:257; West, p. 121; H√§gg, p. 47. but that might simply have been a compilation of fables ascribed to him.Aesop's Fables, ed. D.L. Ashliman, New York 2005, pp. xiii‚Äìxv, xxv‚Äìxxvi Various Classical authors name Aesop as the originator of fables. Sophocles, in a poem addressed to Euripides, made reference to the North Wind and the Sun.Athenaeus 13.82 . Socrates while in prison turned some of the fables into verse,Plato, Phaedo 61b . of which Diogenes La√´rtius records a small fragment.Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers 2.5.42 : \\"He also composed a fable, in the style of Aesop, not very artistically, and it begins‚ÄîAesop one day did this sage counsel give / To the Corinthian magistrates: not to trust / The cause of virtue to the people's judgment.\\" The early Roman playwright and poet Ennius also rendered at least one of Aesop's fables in Latin verse, of which the last two lines still exist.Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 2.29. Collections of what are claimed to be Aesop's Fables were transmitted by a series of authors writing in both Greek and Latin. Demetrius of Phalerum made what may have been the earliest, probably in prose (), contained in ten books for the use of orators, although that has since been lost.Perry, Ben E. \\"Demetrius of Phalerum and the Aesopic Fables\\", Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 93, 1962, pp. 287‚Äì346. Next appeared an edition in elegiac verse, cited by the Suda, but the author's name is unknown. Phaedrus, a freedman of Augustus, rendered the fables into Latin in the 1st century CE. At about the same time Babrius turned the fables into Greek choliambics. A 3rd-century author, Titianus, is said to have rendered the fables into prose in a work now lost.Ausonius, Epistles 12 . Avianus (of uncertain date, perhaps the 4th century) translated 42 of the fables into Latin elegiacs. The 4th-century grammarian Dositheus Magister also made a collection of Aesop's Fables, now lost. Aesop's Fables continued to be revised and translated through the ensuing centuries, with the addition of material from other cultures, so that the body of fables known today bears little relation to those Aesop originally told. With a surge in scholarly interest beginning toward the end of the 20th century, some attempt has been made to determine the nature and content of the very earliest fables which may be most closely linked to the historic Aesop.BNP 1:258‚Äì9; West; Niklas Holzberg, The Ancient Fable: An Introduction, pp. 12‚Äì13; see also Ainoi, Logoi, Mythoi: Fables in Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic Greek by Gert-Jan van Dijk and History of the Graeco-Latin Fable by Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados. Physical appearance and the question of African origin The anonymously authored Aesop Romance begins with a vivid description of Aesop's appearance, saying he was \\"of loathsome aspect... potbellied, misshapen of head, snub-nosed, swarthy, dwarfish, bandy-legged, short-armed, squint-eyed, liver-lipped‚Äîa portentous monstrosity,\\"The Aesop Romance, translated by Lloyd W. Daly, in Anthology of Ancient Greek Popular Literature, ed. William Hansen, p. 111. or as another translation has it, \\"a faulty creation of Prometheus when half- asleep.\\"Papademetriou, pp. 14‚Äì15. The earliest text by a known author that refers to Aesop's appearance is Himerius in the 4th century, who says that Aesop \\"was laughed at and made fun of, not because of some of his tales but on account of his looks and the sound of his voice.\\"Himerius, Orations 46.4, translated by Robert J. Penella in Man and the Word: The Orations of Himerius, p. 250. The evidence from both of these sources is dubious, since Himerius lived some 800 years after Aesop and his image of Aesop may have come from The Aesop Romance, which is essentially fiction; but whether based on fact or not, at some point the idea of an ugly, even deformed Aesop took hold in popular imagination. Scholars have begun to examine why and how this \\"physiognomic tradition\\" developed.See Lissarrage; Papademetriou; Compton, Victim of the Muses; Lefkowitz, \\"Ugliness and Value in the Life of Aesop\\" in Kakos: Badness and Anti-value in Classical Antiquity ed. Sluiter and Rosen. Example of a coin image from ancient Delphi thought by one antiquarian to represent Aesop. A much later tradition depicts Aesop as a black African from Ethiopia. The first known promulgator of the idea was Planudes, a Byzantine scholar of the 13th century who wrote a biography of Aesop based on The Aesop Romance and conjectured that Aesop might have been Ethiopian, given his name.\\"... niger, unde & nomen adeptus est (idem enim Aesopus quod Aethiops)\\" is one Latin translation of Planudes' Greek; see Aesopi Phrygis Fabulae , p. 9. An English translation of Planudes' biography from 1687 says that \\"his Complexion [was] black, from which dark Tincture he contracted his Name (Aesopus being the same with Aethiops)\\". When asked his origin by a prospective new master, Aesop replies, \\"I am a Negro\\"; numerous illustrations by Francis Barlow accompany this text and depict Aesop accordingly.Tho. Philipott (translating Planudes), Aesop's Fables with His Life: in English, French and Latin, pp. 1 and 7. But according to Gert-Jan van Dijk, \\"Planudes' derivation of 'Aesop' from 'Aethiopian' is... etymologically incorrect,\\"Gert-Jan van Dijk, \\"Aesop\\" entry in The Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece, ed. Nigel Wilson, p. 18. and Frank Snowden says that Planudes' account is \\"worthless as to the reliability of Aesop as 'Ethiopian.'\\"Frank M. Snowden, Jr., Blacks in Antiquity: Ethiopians in the Greco-Roman Experience (hereafter Snowden), p. 264. The tradition of Aesop's African origin was continued in Britain, as attested by the lively figurine of a negro from the Chelsea porcelain factory which appeared in its Aesop series in the mid-18th century. It then carried forward into the 19th century. The frontispiece of William Godwin's Fables Ancient and Modern (1805) has a copperplate illustration of Aesop relating his stories to little children that gives his features a distinctly African appearance.Godwin then used the nom de plume of Edward Baldwin. The cover can be viewed online The collection includes the fable of \\"Washing the Blackamoor White\\", although updating it and making the Ethiopian 'a black footman'. In 1856 William Martin Leake repeated the false etymological linkage of \\"Aesop\\" with \\"Aethiop\\" when he suggested that the \\"head of a negro\\" found on several coins from ancient Delphi (with specimens dated as early as 520 BCE)Ancient Coins of Phocis web page, accessed 11-12-2010. might depict Aesop, presumably to commemorate (and atone for) his execution at Delphi,William Martin Leake, Numismata Hellenica: A Catalogue of Greek Coins, p. 45. but Theodor Panofka supposed the head to be a portrait of Delphos, founder of Delphi,Theodor Panofka, Antikenkranz zum f√ºnften Berliner Winckelmannsfest: Delphi und Melaine, p. 7 ; an illustration of the coin in question follows p. 16. a view more widely repeated by later historians.Snowden, pp. 150‚Äì51 and 307-8. The idea that Aesop was Ethiopian seems supported by the presence of camels, elephants and apes in the fables, even though these African elements are more likely to have come from Egypt and Libya than from Ethiopia, and the fables featuring African animals may have entered the body of Aesopic fables long after Aesop actually lived.Robert Temple, Introduction to Aesop: The Complete Fables, pp. xx‚Äìxxi. Nevertheless, in 1932 the anthropologist J. H. Driberg, repeating the Aesop/Aethiop linkage, asserted that, while \\"some say he [Aesop] was a Phrygian... the more general view... is that he was an African\\", and \\"if Aesop was not an African, he ought to have been;\\"Driberg, 1932. and in 2002 Richard A. Lobban cited the number of African animals and \\"artifacts\\" in the Aesopic fables as \\"circumstantial evidence\\" that Aesop may have been a Nubian folkteller.Lobban, 2002. Aesop shown in Japanese dress in a 1659 edition of the fables from Kyoto Popular perception of Aesop as black was to be encouraged by comparison between his fables and the stories of the trickster Br'er Rabbit told by African-American slaves. In Ian Colvin's introduction to Aesop in Politics (1914), for example, the fabulist is bracketed with Uncle Remus, \\"For both were slaves, and both were black\\". The traditional role of the slave Aesop as \\"a kind of culture hero of the oppressed\\" is further promoted by the fictional Life, emerging \\"as a how-to handbook for the successful manipulation of superiors\\".Kurke 2010, pp. 11‚Äì12. Such a perception was reinforced at the popular level by the 1971 TV production Aesop's Fables in which Bill Cosby played Aesop. In that mixture of live action and animation, Aesop tells fables that differentiate between realistic and unrealistic ambition and his version there of \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\" illustrates how to take advantage of an opponent's over- confidence.Complete film at Black Junction On other continents Aesop has occasionally undergone a degree of acculturation. This is evident in Isango Portobello's 2010 production of the play Aesop's Fables at the Fugard Theatre in Cape Town, South Africa. Based on a script by British playwright Peter Terson (1983), it was radically adapted by the director Mark Dornford-May as a musical using native African instrumentation, dance and stage conventions. Although Aesop is portrayed as Greek, and dressed in the short Greek tunic, the all-black production contextualises the story in the recent history of South Africa. The former slave, we are told \\"learns that liberty comes with responsibility as he journeys to his own freedom, joined by the animal characters of his parable-like fables.\\"Cape Argus, 31 May 2010 One might compare with this Brian Seward's Aesop's Fabulous Fables (2009), which first played in Singapore with a cast of mixed ethnicities. In it Chinese theatrical routines are merged with those of a standard musical.There are short excerpts on YouTube here . There had already been an example of Asian acculturation in 17th-century Japan. There Portuguese missionaries had introduced a translation of the fables (Esopo no Fabulas, 1593) that included the biography of Aesop. This was then taken up by Japanese printers and taken through several editions under the title Isopo Monogatari. Even when Europeans were expelled from Japan and Christianity proscribed, this text survived, in part because the figure of Aesop had been assimilated into the culture and depicted in woodcuts as dressed in Japanese costume.Elisonas, J.S.A. \\"Fables and Imitations: Kirishitan literature in the forest of simple letters\\", Bulletin of Portuguese Japanese Studies, Lisbon, 2002, pp. 13‚Äì17.Marceau, Lawrence.

None of these images have survived. According to Philostratus, With the advent of printing in Europe, various illustrators tried to recreate this scene. One of the earliest was in Spain's La vida del Ysopet con sus fabulas historiadas (1489, see above). In France there was I. Baudoin's Fables d'√âsope Phrygien (1631) and Matthieu Guillemot's Les images ou tableaux de platte peinture des deux Philostrates (1637).Antonio Bernat Vistarini, Tam√°s Saj√≥: Imago Veritatis. La circulaci√≥n de la imagen simb√≥lica entre f√°bula y emblema, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Studia Aurea 5 (2007), figures 2 and 1 In England there was Francis Cleyn's frontispiece to John Ogilby's The Fables of Aesop and the much later frontispiece to Godwin's Fables Ancient and Modern mentioned above in which the swarthy fabulist points out three of his characters to the children seated about him. Early on, the representation of Aesop as an ugly slave emerged. The later tradition which makes Aesop a black African resulted in depictions ranging from 17th-century engravings to a television portrayal by a black comedian. In general, beginning in the 20th century, plays have shown Aesop as a slave, but not ugly, while movies and television shows (such as The Bullwinkle Show) have depicted him as neither ugly nor a slave. In 1843, the archaeologist Otto Jahn suggested that Aesop was the person depicted on a Greek red-figure cup, c. 450 BCE, in the Vatican Museums.Lissarrague, p.137. Paul Zanker describes the figure as a man with \\"emaciated body and oversized head... furrowed brow and open mouth\\", who \\"listens carefully to the teachings of the fox sitting before him. He has pulled his mantle tightly around his meager body, as if he were shivering... he is ugly, with long hair, bald head, and unkempt, scraggly beard, and is clearly uncaring of his appearance.\\"Paul Zanker, The Mask of Socrates, pp. 33‚Äì34. Some archaeologists have suggested that the Hellenistic statue of a bearded hunchback with an intellectual appearance, discovered in the 18th century and pictured at the head of this article, also depicts Aesop, although alternative identifications have since been put forward.The question is discussed by Lisa Trentin in \\"What's in a hump? Re-examining the hunchback in the Villa-Albani-Torlonia\\" in The Cambridge Classical Journal (New Series) December 2009 55 : pp 130‚Äì156; available as an academic reprint online Vel√°zquez in the Prado. Aesop began to appear equally early in literary works. The 4th century BCE Athenian playwright Alexis put Aesop on the stage in his comedy \\"Aesop\\", of which a few lines survive (Athenaeus 10.432); conversing with Solon, Aesop praises the Athenian practice of adding water to wine.Attribution of these lines to Aesop is conjectural; see the reference and footnote in Kurke 2010, p 356. Leslie Kurke suggests that Aesop may have been \\"a staple of the comic stage\\" of this era.Kurke 2010, p. 356. The 3rd-century- BCE poet Poseidippus of Pella wrote a narrative poem entitled \\"Aesopia\\" (now lost), in which Aesop's fellow slave Rhodopis (under her original name Doricha) was frequently mentioned, according to Athenaeus 13.596. Pliny would later identify Rhodopis as Aesop's lover, a romantic motif that would be repeated in subsequent popular depictions of Aesop. Aesop plays a fairly prominent part in Plutarch's conversation piece \\"The Banquet of the Seven Sages\\" in the 1st century CE.Loeb translation The fabulist then makes a cameo appearance in the novel A True Story by the 2nd-century satirist Lucian; when the narrator arrives at the Island of the Blessed, he finds that \\"Aesop the Phrygian was there, too; he acts as their jester.\\"Lucian, Verae Historiae (A True Story) 2.18 (Reardon translation). Beginning with the Heinrich Steinhowel edition of 1476, many translations of the fables into European languages, which also incorporated Planudes' Life of Aesop, featured illustrations depicting him as a hunchback. The 1687 edition of Aesop's Fables with His Life: in English, French and Latin included 28 engravings by Francis Barlow that show him as a dwarfish hunchback (see in the section above), and his facial features appear to accord with his statement in the text (p. 7), \\"I am a Negro\\". The Spaniard Diego Vel√°zquez painted a portrait of Aesop, dated 1639‚Äì40 and now in the collection of the Museo del Prado. The presentation is anachronistic and Aesop, while arguably not handsome, displays no physical deformities. It was partnered by another portrait of Menippus, a satirical philosopher equally of slave-origin. A similar philosophers series was painted by fellow Spaniard Jusepe de Ribera,There is a note on another from this series on the Christies site who is credited with two portraits of Aesop. \\"Aesop, poet of the fables\\" is in the El Escorial gallery and pictures him as an author leaning on a staff by a table which holds copies of his work, one of them a book with the name Hissopo on the cover. The other is in the Museo de Prado, dated 1640‚Äì50 and titled \\"Aesop in beggar's rags\\". There he is also shown at a table, holding a sheet of paper in his left hand and writing with the other. While the former hints at his lameness and deformed back, the latter only emphasises his poverty. In 1690, French playwright Edm√© Boursault's Les fables d'Esope (later known as Esope √† la ville) premiered in Paris. A sequel, Esope √† la cour (Aesop at Court), was first performed in 1701; drawing on a mention in Herodotus 2.134-5 that Aesop had once been owned by the same master as Rhodopis, and the statement in Pliny 36.17 that she was Aesop's concubine as well, the play introduced Rodope as Aesop's mistress, a romantic motif that would be repeated in later popular depictions of Aesop. Rhodope, in love with Aesop; engraving by Bartolozzi, 1782, after Kauffman's original Sir John Vanbrugh's comedy \\"Aesop\\" was premi√®red at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, London, in 1697 and was frequently performed there for the next twenty years. A translation and adaptation of Boursault's Les fables d'Esope, Vanbrugh's play depicted a physically ugly Aesop acting as adviser to Learchus, governor of Cyzicus under King Croesus, and using his fables to solve romantic problems and quiet political unrest.Mark Loveridge, A History of Augustan Fable (hereafter Loveridge), pp. 166‚Äì68. In 1780, the anonymously authored novelette The History and Amours of Rhodope was published in London. The story casts the two slaves Rhodope and Aesop as unlikely lovers, one ugly and the other beautiful; ultimately Rhodope is parted from Aesop and marries the Pharaoh of Egypt. Some editions of the volume were illustrated with an engraving by Francesco Bartolozzi of a work by the painter Angelica Kauffman. Titled \\"The beautiful Rhodope in love with Aesop\\", it pictures Rhodope leaning on an urn; she holds out her hand to Aesop, who is seated under a tree and turns his head to look at her. His right arm rests on a cage of doves, towards which he gestures. There is some ambiguity here, for while the cage suggests the captive state of both of them, a raven perched outside the cage may allude to his supposed colour.View online; there is a copy in the Metropolitan Museum, NY In fact, the whole picture is planned to suggest how different the couple are. Rhodope and Aesop lean on opposite elbows, gesture with opposite hands, and while Rhodope's hand is held palm upwards, Aesop's is held palm downwards. She stands while he sits; he is dressed in dark clothes, she in white. The theme of their relationship was taken up again in 1844 by Walter Savage Landor (author of Imaginary Conversations), who published two fictional dialogues between Aesop and Rhodope.The second of these is included in Selections from the Imaginary conversations of Walter Savage Landor, New York 1899, archived online, pp. 1‚Äì14 Later in the 19th century the subject of Aesop telling his tales was made popular by the painting of him entertaining the maids of Xanthus by Roberto Fontana (1844‚Äì1907). A depiction of the fabulist surrounded by laughing young women, it went on to win a prize at the Milanese Brera Academy in 1876 and was then shown at the 1878 International Exhibition and the 11th exhibition of the Societ√† di Belle Arti di Trieste in 1879. A later painting by Julian Russell Story widens Aesop's audience by showing people of both sexes and all ages enjoying his narration.\\"Aesop's Fables\\", Blouin art sales. Although Aesop is pictured as ugly in both, his winning personality is suggested by his smiling face and lively gestures. =20th century genres= The 20th century saw the publication of three novels about Aesop. A.D. Wintle's Aesop (London, 1943) was a plodding fictional biography described in a review of the time as so boring that it makes the fables embedded in it seem 'complacent and exasperating'. The two others, preferring the fictional 'life' to any approach to veracity, are genre works. The most recent is John Vornholt's The Fabulist (1993) in which 'an ugly, mute slave is delivered from wretchedness by the gods and blessed with a wondrous voice. [It is] the tale of a most unlikely adventurer, dispatched to far and perilous realms to battle impossible beasts and terrible magicks.' The other novel was George S. Hellman's Peacock's Feather (published in California in 1931). Its unlikely plot made it the perfect vehicle for the 1946 Hollywood spectacular, Night in Paradise. The perennial image of Aesop as an ugly slave is kept up in the movie, with a heavily disguised Turhan Bey cast in the role. In a plot containing 'some of the most nonsensical screen doings of the year', he becomes entangled with the intended bride of King Croesus, a Persian princess played by Merle Oberon, and makes such a hash of it that he has to be rescued by the gods.Universal Horrors, McFarland, 2007, pp. 531‚Äì5 The 1953 teleplay Aesop and Rhodope takes up another theme of his fictional history.Aesop and Rhodope at the Internet Movie Database Written by Helene Hanff, it was broadcast on Hallmark Hall of Fame with Lamont Johnson playing Aesop. The three-act A raposa e as uvas (\\"The Fox and the Grapes\\" 1953), marked Aesop's entry into Brazilian theatre. The three-act play was by Guilherme Figueiredo and has been performed in many countries, including a videotaped production in China in 2000 under the title or . The play is described as an allegory about freedom with Aesop as the main character.Encyclopedia of Latin American Theater, Greenwood 2003, p.72 Occasions on which Aesop was played as black include Richard Durham's Destination Freedom radio show broadcast (1949), where the drama \\"The Death of Aesop\\" portrayed him as an Ethiopian. In 1971, Bill Cosby starred as Aesop in the TV production Aesop's Fables - The Tortoise and the Hare.WorldCatAvailable on YouTube He was also played by Mhlekahi Mosiea in the 2010 South Africa adaptation of British playwright Peter Terson's musical Aesop's Fables.

In 2015, The National Post explored MacDonald's analysis of the Croatia‚ÄìSerbia genocide case. Agreeing with the ruling to dismiss both cases, MacDonald was sceptical of either Serbia or Croatia having committed genocide, writing that it was \\"not enough to kill people, or move them around and steal their land\\". He added that it was essential to prove any perpetrators of genocide \\"had this bigger motivation to destroy the group in whole or in part\\".

Fossils belonging to this family have been found in North America, Greenland, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The family Capitosauridae is synonymous with Mastodonsauridae. Description =Size= Paracyclotosaurus crookshanki compared to a human Mastodonsaurids were generally large amphibians, with some length estimates ranging from 3 to 6 meters. Some genera, like Mastodonsaurus and Cyclotosaurus were specially large, reaching at least 4 meters or more. Other genera like Parotosuchus and Paracyclotosaurus only reached 2 meters or more in length, but it's still pretty large compared to modern-day amphibians. =Distinguishing features= Some mastodonsaurids including Parotosuchus were covered in a scaly skin, unlike the smooth skin of modern-day amphibians, and probably moved with an eel-like motion in the water.Yahoo News: Antarctic fossil prompts rethink about amphibian history Another peculiar mastodonsaurid is Sclerothorax, with unusual features including its elongated neural spines. The neural spines are tallest at the front of the spine. Sclerothorax also has a very large pectoral girdle; the interclavicle bone is longer than the skull, meaning that Sclerothorax has the proportionally largest interclavicle of any temnospondyl. The body of Sclerothorax is covered by small scale-like bony ossicles that would have been embedded in the dermis in life. The skull of Sclerothorax is short, wide, and roughly rectangular in shape. The snout is wider than the cheek region. The bones along the midline of the skull roof are also very wide relative to those of other temnospondyls. =Skull structures= Skull cast of Stanocephalosaurus There is a lot of known information about the skulls of mastodonsaurids, for example, Stanocephalosaurus, one of the most well-known mastodonsaurids, has a lot of data about its skull. The skull of Stanocephalosaurus has key features characteristic to other temnospondyls, with the most apparent being the flattened shape of its skull roof. The dorsal as well as ventral surfaces of the skull of Stanocephalosaurus have well ornamented honeycombed patterns throughout. Palatal views of skulls in this genus show narrow interpalatal vacuities, as well as paired palatal tusks alternately functioning on the vomer and palatine, with the vomerine tusks directed backwards. This animal shows an increased expansion of the pterygoids and palatines, as well as narrow posterior nostrils. The vomer also bears two vomerine rows: a transversal denticle row and a longitudinal denticle row that runs along the inner margin of the choana. The palatines and ectopterygoids are broader than in other temnospondyls, which is somewhat common within mastodonsaurids. Stanocephalosaurus also has a long, triangular skull which is much longer than broad, and has an elongated preorbital region continuously narrowing anteriorly to an obtuse rounded snout. This type of skull is very similar to that of Mastodonsaurus, which is also triangular in shape. The Stanocephalosaurus has at least 100 straight and conical teeth on the premaxilla and maxilla combined, gradually increasing in size towards the front. While there is a lot of known information about Stanocephalosaurus, some of the skull regions which were previously inaccessible or too poorly preserved on Stanocephalosaurus have been observed with X-ray micro-CT scans, including the otic capsule, delta groove of the exoccipital, as well as parts of the arterial and nervous system. Air pockets around the stapes of Stanocephalosaurus have been hypothesized to act as resonance chambers, meaning that the spoon-shaped inner ear bone could be related to underwater hearing. This trait is possibly associated with early tetrapod evolution, which probably also appears on other members of this family and can act as a link to anuran tympanum evolution. The narrow head and elongated snout of Stanocephalosaurus suggests that stress levels during biting are slightly higher than temnospondyls with a wider and shorter skull. Its skull also has an elongated preorbital region compared to other mastodonsaurids. The vertebrae of Stanocephalosaurus are rhachitomous, with a neural arch and a bipartite centrum that is divided into a large, unpaired wedge-shaped intercentrum and smaller paired pleurocentra. In anterior and posterior views, the intercentrum is a dorsally half-ring, surrounding the persistent notochord from ventral and lateral sides. Lateral and ventral surfaces of the intercentrum are smooth, suggesting a continuation of cartilage due to the unfinished medial surface. The posterodorsal margin of the intercentrum also shows a parapophysis for articulation with the capitulum of the ribs. Skeleton of Mastodonsaurus, with a close up view of the skull Another well-known mastodonsaurid in terms of fossil knowledge is Mastodonsaurus, and there is also some known data about the skull itself. The large, oval eye sockets are midway along the skull. The jaws are lined with conical teeth, two large tusks project up from the end of the lower jaw, fitting through openings on the palate and emerging out from the top of the skull when the jaw is closed. The body of Mastodonsaurus is relatively small in proportion to the large head, and the tail is relatively short. The greatly reduced limb bones have joints that are poorly developed. Skeletal reconstruction of Paracyclotosaurus Paracyclotosaurus is yet again, another well-known mastodonsaurid, and just like most genera of the family, it had various species. This mastodonsaurid has at least three species, including its type species, which is P. davidi, along with two other: P. crookshanki and P. morganorum. The completeness of the skeleton of this animal led to an accurate description. The small distortion of the head can be overlooked, and the complete preservation of the skull and jaws makes its shape certain at a length of 60 cm. The right corner of the head is essentially undistorted and shows that the skull at its point of greatest depth is almost exactly as high as the lower jaw. The lower jaw also has its symphysis the same height as the skull above it. Therefore, at its point of greatest height, the head was essentially of oval section, 22 cm high and 44 cm wide. The nostril, orbit and tympanic membrane are all directed upward, but whether the eye could be projected upward above the head to give a horizontal view similar to a frog, is difficult to determine. With very similar features to Cyclotosaurus, Subcyclotosaurus is another good example of mastodonsaurid. Its skull is characterized by the small tabular without any trace of a \\"horn\\", but with a round lappet that approaches the squamosal flange lateral to the tympanic membrane, failing to meet it by about its own width. The occiput between the otic notches is proportionately wide, a reflection of the small size of the skull. The skull is otherwise of normal mastodonsaurid structure, being specifically more similar to Parotosuchus than to any other genera of this family. The skull also has a small internasal vacuity between the dorsal processes of the premaxillae and lateral lines are often shown as continuous grooves with well-defined borders. A deep groove on the maxilla begins immediately behind and lateral to the nostril and passes straight back to the lachrymal, on which bone it turns outward and forward and ends abruptly. Another groove appears to begin on the maxilla, immediately lateral to that described above. It passes back just above the insertion of the teeth for the full length of the bone. The supraorbital groove begins abruptly on the dorsal surface of the premaxilla, immediately passes on to the nasal, and extends back on that bone close to its suture with the lachrymal. It then comes on to the prefrontal, passing on to the frontal where that bone enters the orbital border. Then as a well-defined groove it surrounds the hinder part of the orbit, turns vertically on to the jugal, and then backward to cross the point where jugal, quadratojugal and squamosal meet, continuing over the squamosal to pass back on to the body. Xenotosuchus skull, showing the full complement of tetrapod skull roof bones Xenotosuchus is a member of this which is not very well known, and only a few fragments have been discovered from this animal. This genus was originally a species of Parotosuchus. Like many mastodontosaurids, it was a large animal with a large head. Its amphibian life history meant that the distinct shape of the skull roof would change from a generalized tadpole-like skull to the distinct adult shape. The head bones are covered in large pits and grooves, indicating extensive dermal armour on the head. Both the upper and lower jaw had tusks, those of the upper jaw being situated on a second row of teeth on the vomer and palatine bone. Contrary to related forms like Mastodonsaurus and Stanocephalosaurus, the tusks of the lower jaw were of moderate size and did not penetrate the premaxilla. Like the mentioned Xenotosuchus, the genus Wetlugasaurus is also one of the smaller and less known mastodonsaurids. It had a skull that measured around , and reached a total length of at least , and although it is pretty large compared to modern-day amphibians, Wetlugasaurus is still very small compared to most of the other mastodonsaurids. Paleobiology Mastodonsaurids were piscivorous, mainly preying on small and mid-sized fish, although they also ate land-living animals, such as small archosaurs. Some evidences, including the fossils of some smaller temnospondyls bear tooth marks made by mastodonsaurid-like animals. It is very likely that mastodonsaurids caught their food like the living Giant Salamander, waiting until the prey came near, then quickly opening their enormous mouths and swallowing them prey whole. The most probable food would be small fishes, up to some 15 cm. long, which swam in shoals. Paleoecology Mastodonsaurids were aquatic animals that rarely left water and may have been completely unable to leave the water, as large quantities of bones have been found that suggests that many species have died en masse when pools dried up during times of drought. They mostly inhabited swampy pools and fed mainly on fish, whose remains have been found in fossilized coprolites.Benes, Josef. Prehistoric Animals and Plants. Prague, Artia, 1979.

He was the first person to demonstrate that the Moon moved around the Earth in an elliptical orbit; and he was the only person to predict the transit of Venus of 1639, an event which he and his friend William Crabtree were the only two people to observe and record. His early death and the chaos of the English Civil War nearly resulted in the loss to science of his treatise on the transit, Venus in sole visa; but for this and his other work he is acknowledged as one of the founding fathers of British astronomy.  Early life and education  Jeremiah Horrocks was born at Lower Lodge Farm in Toxteth Park, a former royal deer park near Liverpool, Lancashire. His father James had moved to Toxteth Park to be apprenticed to Thomas Aspinwall, a watchmaker, and subsequently married his master's daughter Mary. Both families were well educated Puritans; the Horrocks sent their younger sons to the University of Cambridge and the Aspinwalls favoured Oxford. For their unorthodox beliefs the Puritans were excluded from public office, which tended to push them towards other callings; by 1600 the Aspinwalls had become a successful family of watchmakers. Jeremiah was introduced early to astronomy; his boyhood chores included measuring the local noon used to set local clocks, and his Puritan upbringing instilled an enduring suspicion of astrology, witchcraft and magic. In 1632 Horrocks matriculated at Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge as a sizar. At Cambridge he associated with the mathematician John Wallis and the platonist, John Worthington. At that time he was one of only a few at Cambridge to accept Copernicus's revolutionary heliocentric theory, and he studied the works of Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe and others. In 1635, for reasons not clear, Horrocks left Cambridge without graduating. Marston suggests that he may have needed to defer the extra cost this entailed until he was employed, whilst Aughton speculates that he may have failed his exams due to concentrating too much on his own interests, or that he did not want to take Anglican orders, and so a degree was of limited use to him.  Astronomical observations  Now committed to the study of astronomy, Horrocks began to collect astronomical books and equipment; by 1638 he owned the best telescope he could find. Liverpool was a seafaring town so navigational instruments such as the astrolabe and cross staff were easy to find. But there was no market for the very specialised astronomical instruments he needed, so his only option was to make his own. He was well placed to do this; his father and uncles were watchmakers with expertise in creating precise instruments. Apparently he helped with the family business by day and, in return, the watchmakers in his family supported his vocation by assisting in the design and construction of instruments to study the stars at night. Horrocks owned a three-foot radius astronomicus ‚Äì a cross staff with movable sights used to measure the angle between two stars ‚Äì but by January 1637 he had reached the limitations of this instrument and so built a larger and higher precision version. While a youth he read most of the astronomical treatises of his day and marked their weaknesses; by the age of seventeen he was suggesting new lines of research. Tradition has it that after he left home he supported himself by holding a curacy in Much Hoole, near Preston in Lancashire, but there is little evidence for this. According to local tradition in Much Hoole, he lived at Carr House, within the Bank Hall Estate, Bretherton. Carr House was a substantial property owned by the Stones family who were prosperous farmers and merchants, and Horrocks was probably a tutor for the Stones' children.  Lunar research  Horrocks was the first to demonstrate that the Moon moved in an elliptical path around the Earth, and he posited that comets followed elliptical orbits. He supported his theories by analogy to the motions of a conical pendulum, noting that after a plumb bob was drawn back and released it followed an elliptical path, and that its major axis rotated in the direction of revolution as did the apsides of the Moon's orbit. He anticipated Isaac Newton in suggesting the influence of the Sun as well as the Earth on the Moon's orbit. In the PrincipiaIsaac Newton, 'Principia', Book 3, Proposition 35, Scholium. Newton acknowledged Horrocks's work in relation to his theory of lunar motion. In the final months of his life Horrocks made detailed studies of tides in attempting to explain the nature of lunar causation of tidal movements.  Transit of Venus  A representation of Horrocks' recording of the transit published in 1662 by Johannes Hevelius The title page of Jeremiah Horrocks' Opera Posthuma, published by the Royal Society in 1672. In 1627, Johannes Kepler had published his Rudolphine Tables and two years later he published extracts from the tables in his pamphlet De raris mirisque Anni 1631 which included an admonitio ad astronomos (warning to astronomers) concerning a transit of Mercury in 1631 and transits of Venus in 1631 and 1761. Horrocks' own observations, combined with those of his friend and correspondent William Crabtree, had convinced him that Kepler's Rudolphine tables, although more accurate than the commonly used tables produced by Philip Van Lansberg, were still in need of some correction. Kepler's tables had predicted a near-miss of a transit of Venus in 1639 but, having made his own observations of Venus for years, Horrocks predicted a transit would indeed occur. Horrocks made a simple helioscope by focusing the image of the Sun through a telescope onto a plane surface, whereby an image of the Sun could be safely observed. From his location in Much Hoole he calculated the transit would begin at approximately 3:00 pm on 24 November 1639, Julian calendar (or 4 December in the Gregorian calendar). The weather was cloudy but he first observed the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15 pm; and he continued to observe for half an hour until the Sun set. The 1639 transit was also observed by William Crabtree from his home in Broughton near Manchester. Horrocks' observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess as to the size of Venus‚Äîpreviously thought to be larger and closer to Earth‚Äîand to estimate of the distance between the Earth and the Sun, now known as the astronomical unit (AU). His figure of 95 million kilometres (59 million miles, 0.63 AU) was far from the 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) known today, but it was more accurate than any suggested up to that time. A treatise by Horrocks on the study of the transit, Venus in sole visa (Venus seen on the Sun), was later published by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius at his own expense; it caused great excitement when revealed to members of the Royal Society in 1662, some 20 years after it was written. It presented Horrocks' enthusiastic and romantic nature, including humorous comments and passages of original poetry. When speaking of the century separating Venusian transits, he rhapsodised: :\\" ...Thy return :Posterity shall witness; years must roll :Away, but then at length the splendid sight :Again shall greet our distant children's eyes.\\" It was a time of great uncertainty in astronomy, when the world's astronomers could not agree amongst themselves and theologians fulminated against claims that contradicted Scripture. Horrocks, although a pious young man, came down firmly on the side of scientific determinism. > It is wrong to hold the most noble Science of the Stars guilty of > uncertainty on account of some people's uncertain observations. Through no > fault of its own it suffers these complaints which arise from the > uncertainty and error not of the celestial motions but of human observations > . . . I do not consider that any imperfections in the motions of the stars > have so far been detected, nor do I believe that they are ever to be found. > Far be it from me to allow that God has created the heavenly bodies more > imperfectly than man has observed them. ‚Äì Jeremiah Horrocks  Death and remembrance  Jeremiah Horrocks Observatory on Moor Park, Preston Horrocks returned to Toxteth Park sometime in mid-1640 and died suddenly from unknown causes on 3 January 1641, at the age of 22. As expressed by Crabtree, \\"What an incalculable loss!\\"Opera Posthuma of Jeremiah Horrocks, ed. John Wallis, London, 1672. He has been described as a bridge which connected Newton with Copernicus, Galileo, Brahe and Kepler. It is believed that Horrocks was buried at Toxteth Unitarian Chapel, but there is seemingly no proof of this. Horrocks is remembered on a plaque in Westminster Abbey and the lunar crater Horrocks is named after him. In 1859 a marble tablet and stained-glass windows commemorating him were installed in the Parish Church of St Michael, Much Hoole. Horrocks Avenue in Garston, Liverpool is also named after him. In 1927, the Jeremiah Horrocks Observatory was built at Moor Park, Preston. The 2012 transit of Venus was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website.

It is situated on the Vacha River in Smolyan Province, on the borders of Pazardzhik Province and Plovdiv Province, roughly southwest of Plovdiv and downstream (north) of the town of Devin. It is a part of the Dospat-Vacha cascade development of the Vacha River involving five dams and power stations within the Devin municipality, southeast of Sofia. The other four dams are Dospat Dam, Teshel Dam, the Vacha Dam and the Krichim Dam. The Tsankov Kamak dam is the first double curvature arch dam in cupola shape in Bulgaria. It has a maximum dam height of . It is the second in the cascade series from the upstream end, and the last to be developed. Apart from power generation, the other objectives of the five projects are use of water resources for irrigation, drinking and household water supply. While the cascade development started in 1958, construction of the Kamak power plant started on 29 April 2004 and was completed in 2011. Initial estimated cost of the project was Euro 220 million financed by many banks and equipment manufacturers, including VA TECH Finance, Bank Austria Creditanstalt, BNP Paribas Fortis, Raiffeisen Zentralbank, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, and Credit Suisse First Boston. However, the final cost of the project has far outstripped the original estimates due to topography, geology and also possible corruption, which were not assessed at the investigation stage of the project. The carbon emission reduction due to building the Tsankov Kamak HPP is assessed at about 200,000 t CO2 (228,000 tons of –°–û2 including the four rehabilitation projects of the cascade). This credit is transferred to the Austrian carbon-credit program under the Joint Implementation Project mechanism which was agreed for the project within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol to partially meet the project costs. For the reduced emissions, Austria compensates Bulgaria at the rate US$10 per ton of carbon emissions. The Joint Implementation Project has two components, one is the Implementation of the Tsankov Kamak HPP and the other is the rehabilitation of the electro-mechanical components of the other four projects in the cascade development. Two more HPPs, the Vacha I and the Vacha II, with total installed capacity of 20.6 MW, are located in the lower part of the cascade. Natural landscape The Tsankov Kamak arch dam, associated works and the HPP station are located on the Vacha River, which is the second longest river in Bulgaria. It raises in the Rhodope hill ranges which borders Greece. It is situated on the borders of Smolyan Province, Pazardzhik Province and Plovdiv Province, roughly southwest of Plovdiv and downstream (north) of the town of Devin. The dam site is located about downstream of the confluence of the Vacha River and the Gashnya River, in the valley known as Gashnya Valley. The catchment area at the dam site is and the annual flow is assessed to be approximately 650 million cubic metres with an average inflow of per second. The dam has been designed for a gross storage of 111 million cubic metres. The hydropower potential in the river between Sredna and Vacha had remained unexploited under the five dams development initiative, but is now utilized through the Tsankov Kamak project. The reservoir submergence is in rocky terrain, which is deforested and has unproductive vegetation. The catchment is highly rugged and mountainous with high altitudes, high watershed flats, deep ravines and large tectonic kettles. The upper and lower course of the river flows through deep cut banks. In the narrow valley stretch of the Vacha River where the project is located, the geological formation consists of sound granites and gneissic formations except for a small patch of about , which is the fractured zone of mylonites, which was filled up with concrete. The dam‚Äôs rock foundation has seven types of rocks with elastic modules values varying from 12,000 MPa to 72,000 MPa and a Poisson‚Äôs ratio varying between 0.24 and 0.27. The damping ratio of 10% for this foundation has been adopted in the dynamic analysis. The intake structure and the pressure tunnel pass through difficult geological formations. Due to this geological feature, particularly at the intake structure, an area of about was required to be plugged in the Gashnia Valley. Construction Tsankov Kamak Hydro Power Plant The Natsionalna Elektricheska Kompania EAD (NEK EAD) was awarded the contract to the project in 2001, and in November 2003 they forwarded their plans to start construction of the project to the Government of Bulgaria. At the end of the year 2003, Alpine Mayreder, an Austrian company, was awarded the civil works contract of the project. The equipment supply and installations were awarded to Austrian group of suppliers, Andritz Hydro for HEM ‚Äì equipment and P√∂yry Energy GmbH for engineering with Energoproekt Hydropower as a Bulgarian Co-designer of the project The project was financed by export and commercial credits, which were finalized in Vienna on 14 November 2003; the financial credit without any backup guarantee by the Government of Bulgaria. The total value of the financing contract was roughly ‚Ç¨220 million (‚Ç¨216 million has been specifically cited), with bank security provided by the Oesterreichische Kontrolbank Aktiengellschaft. The balance amount was financed by the commercial credits provided by VA TECH Finance, Bank Austria Creditanstalt, BNP Paribas Fortis, Raiffeisen Zentralbank, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, and Credit Suisse First Boston who organized the bank credits. Insurance coverage for the export credit of ‚Ç¨100 million was provided by Coface of France; Hermes of Germany; EKN of Sweden and Egap of the Czech Republic apart from the Oesterreichische Kontrolbank Aktiengellschaft (OeKB) which has also covered political and the commercial risks. Construction of the project was considered a challenge in view of the terrain and geologically weak structural region. The building of a new road of about in difficult terrain, with frequent landslides and rockfalls, caused problems in road construction. This significantly increased the cost of the project up to roughly ‚Ç¨500 million. Civil construction works involved six million cubic metres of excavation, two million cubic metres of filling, 850,000 cubic metres of batching and mixing of concrete and placing 100,000 anchors with a total combined length of about . Concreting was done in 3 metre lifts. A service road of 6 metres in width was built on top of the dam. Apart from the Christian Schild and 60 engineers of the Alpine Slovakia and contractors of civil engineering works of the project, some 1200 Bulgarian workers were involved in its construction at one point. Work was carried out continuously, involving 535,000 cubic metres of concrete delivered by a crane of 26 tons capacity, which was erected across the river over the dam. The concreting of the dam began in October 2007 and was completed in January 2010. Project features =Dam= Tsankov Kanak Dam spillway openings of 8 m x 8 m The double curved arch dam is in height with a reservoir water spread area of . It has four spillway blocks designed for a maximum flood discharge of /sec, each provided with radial gates, and has a pressure shaft of in width and in length which is steel lined and bifurcated at the lower end to feed the turbines from the intake on the upstream on the left bank of the dam. It feeds two units of 40 MW capacity turbine generators (Francis Turbines) housed in a surface powerhouse, a tailrace channel of length, and a balancing channel of length. These features are elaborated further with relevant design details. It has gross storage capacity of 111 million cubic metres. The Tsankov Kamak dam has a total length of 459.4 m and crest level of EL 688.50 m, with 22 cantilever blocks which are \\"interconnected by a system of shear boxes\\", which are tangential to the axis at the crest, and the gravity blocks abut on the left and right banks. Horizontal sections of the arch dam are of parabolic shape with fixed thickness. A series of thick shear key locks on both surfaces of each cantilever block are provided to achieve uniform distribution of shear force between the blocks. The dam width at the top is 8.8 metres and at the foundation the base is . The curved part of the arch dam is 340 metres in length and its chord length is . The maximum reservoir water level is EL 685.00 m and the minimum draw down level is EL 670.00 m with a storage capacity of 41 million cubic metres. The spillway has four bays located in the middle section of the dam controlled by radial gates of 8 m x 8 m size each designed to pass a 1 in 1000 year frequency flood of /sec, which raises the water level to EL 687.42 m (all gates open condition) thus allowing for a free board of to top of the dam. The spillway energy dissipation chute has aeration baffle blocks. Over the dam height of 130.5 metres, five galleries are provided in the body of the dam; the gallery at the bottom has been used initially for grouting of the foundation and for drainage and four horizontal inspection galleries at different elevations (at interval). The reservoir stretches over a surface area of and a length of . The filling of the reservoir was started in June 2010 and completed over roughly 15 weeks. A reservoir management plan envisages fish farming and reservoir operation and maintenance along the periphery of the reservoir and its tributaries. Two bottom outlets in the form of steel pipes of diameter, each of length have been provided in the body of the dam which facilitates emptying of the reservoir in any emergency; it takes about 11‚Äì12 hours to empty the reservoir. The outlets have been provided with slide gate controls on the downstream end. The stilling basin of the spillway is also used for energy dissipation of the outflows from the bottom outlets. The penstock/pressure shaft is in the form of a steel lined pressure shaft which is diameter to carry a discharge of /sec for power generation. It is in length (with 10% slope).) and bifurcates into two at the bottom end to feed two turbines, each of 40 MW capacity. Slope protection in the long stretch of the reservoir spread (up to a surface area of ) also involved concreting to the extent of to take care of draw down condition for operating the power stations of the cascade under two daily peaks in the morning and evening. =Power station= The surface power station at the end of pressure shafts has two units, each of 40 MW capacity (Francis turbines) operating under a gross head of and an average net head is . The annual energy generation is about 185 GWh. This also has beneficial impact on other cascade development projects in the basin as the energy generation gets enhanced by a 48% increase. The power station is run as a peaking station with two peaks, one in the morning and the other in the evening. With the completion of the Tsankov Kamak HPP, and the rehabilitation of the other HPPs, and all stations connected to a common grid, the efficiency of the whole cascade is improved and energy production rose by a further 16 GWh per annum for the cascade. The design output of Francis turbines is 41,171 kW each, the turbine speed is 428.6 r.p.m., the generator rating is 46 MVA, and generation voltage is 10.5 kV. An outdoor switch yard is provided next to the surface powerhouse with main two step up transformers of 50 MVA rating and voltage ratio is 10.5/240 kV. The powerhouse is operated both under the remote control mode from the south regional dispatching control and automatically under the local control mode.

Therefore, especially for prototyping or teaching, it would be nice to have a programming language which omits the XML-overhead of BPEL but offers the same features as BPEL. One option is to force the programmers to learn a completely new syntax. The other option is to introduce a new syntax to BPEL. Therefore, the \\"BPEL Simplified Syntax\\" called SimPEL was recommended by the Apache ODE Group, referring to the a mix of both options. However, SimPEL is not equivalent to BPEL and its aims of specifying business processes. In order to come up with an easy scripting syntax, BPELscript is introduced, referring to the second option. BPELscript forks directly from SimPEL aiming on big closeness to BPEL.

History Construction of the Dark Gate started in 1824 by Alexander Rudnay, Archbishop of Esztergom, two years after the foundation stones of St. Adalbert's Basilica were laid. It became known as Dark Gate due to the lack of lighting. The main purpose of the tunnel was to directly connect the Canonic houses with the Seminary, but it also connects the Szentgy√∂rgymez≈ë neighborhood with downtown Esztergom. Above the southern entrance, a Latin sign carved in red marble commemorates Archbishop Rudnay and the year of construction: \\"PRINCEPS PRIMAS ALEXANDER A RUDNA MDCCCXXIV\\" (\\"Prince Primate Alexander Rudnay 1824\\"). From both sides of the tunnel, a huge 3700 m¬≤ wine cellar opens, where the wines of the Archdiocese of Esztergom were kept. During the 1956 revolution, significant events occurred in Esztergom. On 26 October 1956, fourteen people died in the Dark Gate when a T-34 tank shot into a bus heading towards the seminary, which was used as a Russian military facility at the time. The Dark Gate, the seminary, and its surroundings were completely renovated by 2006, the 150th anniversary of the dedication of the cathedral.

Together with Dissorophidae, the family forms Olsoniformes, a clade comprising the medium-large terrestrial dissorophoids. Trematopids are known from numerous localities in North America, primarily in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, and from the Bromacker quarry in Germany.  History of study  The clade Trematopidae was first proposed by American paleontologist S.W. Williston in 1910, although it was named as \\"Trematopsidae\\" following the historical (but inaccurate) derivation from the genus \\"Trematops\\" (now synonymized with Acheloma). British paleontologist D.M.S. Watson proposed a related clade in 1919, Achelomidae, for Acheloma, based on perceived differences separating the taxa; this is now considered a junior synonym of Trematopidae following guidelines of historical precedent. = 19th century history = In 1882, American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope named Acheloma cumminsi based on material collected from the early Permian of Texas. This is technically the first trematopid to be named, although the holotype of Mordex calliprepes was named a year earlier as a species of Limnerpeton by Czech paleontologist Antonin Fritsch in 1881 (one year prior); the status of Mordex as a trematopid remained debated however until the revision by Milner (2018). = 20th century history = In the first half of the 20th century, American paleontologist S.W. Williston named a new genus from the early Permian of Texas, Trematops. At the time, most workers regarded it as only distantly related to Cope's Acheloma. Two additional species of Trematops were named in short order, Trematops thomasi from Oklahoma, named by American paleontologist Maurice Mehl, and Trematops willistoni from Texas, named by American paleontologist E.C. Olson in 1941. Both are now regarded as junior synonyms of Acheloma cumminsi. Olson also named two species of Acheloma, A. whitei and A. pricei; both are now regarded as belonging to Phonerpeton. In the same paper that he named these taxa, Olson also provided the first review of the Trematopidae, synthesizing all of the known material and providing updated taxonomic frameworks. The second half of the 20th century saw an increase in trematopid research. In 1956, Olson named a new genus and species of trematopid from the Vale Formation of Texas, Trematopsis seltini; this is now regarded as a junior synonym of the dissorophid Cacops aspidephorus. In 1969, American paleontologist Peter Vaughn described the first trematopid from New Mexico, Ecolsonia cutlerensis, named for the contemporaneous Olson and the Cutler Formation from which the holotype was collected. A re-description of this taxon based on substantial new material, was completed in 1985 by a team led by American paleontologist David Berman from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. In 1970, Olson named a new species of Trematops from the early Permian of Ohio, \\"Trematops stonei\\"; this is the only occurrence of Acheloma/Trematops outside of Texas and Oklahoma but is now accepted to be a junior synonym of Acheloma cumminsi. In 1973, American paleontologist Theodore Eaton named Actiobates peabodyi, the first and only trematopid from Kansas and the oldest trematopid in North America. Eaton also challenged the longstanding separation of trematopids and dissorophids, synonymizing them under Dissorophidae, but this has not been supported or maintained by subsequent workers. Additional material from the Garnett quarry where Actiobates was discovered, assigned to \\"Hesperoherpeton garnettense\\" may also belong to Actiobates. In 1974, American paleontologist John Bolt published two papers, one describing the first trematopid material from the fossil-rich site near Richards Spur, Oklahoma, and the a second exploring the function of the elongate naris in trematopids. In 1985, Olson described a purported larval specimen of a trematopid; this was subsequently challenged by Canadian paleontologist David Dilkes in 1991, and the specimen is now regarded to be an adult specimen of an amphibamiform dissorophoid. In 1987, the second trematopid from New Mexico, Anconastes vesperus, named for its discovery in El Cobre Canyon in western North America, was described by the same team of Berman, Reisz, and Eberth who described Ecolsonia. Also in 1987, Dilkes and Robert R. Reisz of the University of Toronto re-described the holotypes of Acheloma cumminsi and Trematops milleri and identified them as synonyms; A. cumminsi takes precedent, having been described first. In 1990, Dilkes named a new taxon of trematopid from the early Permian of Texas, Phonerpeton pricei. A study on developmental changes to the characteristic elongate naris of trematopids was undertaken using primarily material from Phonerpeton by Dilkes in 1993. In 1998, the first trematopid from Europe, Tambachia trogallas, from the early Permian Bromacker quarry in Germany was named by a team led by American paleontologist Stuart Sumida of California State University, San Bernardino. = 21st century history = The 21st century has seen a renewed flurry of research into trematopids. In 2010, a team led by Berman described a new taxon from the late Carboniferous of Pennsylvania, Fedexia striegeli, named after the FedEx Corporation on whose land the holotype was found and after Adam Striegel, the discoverer. In 2011, another team led by Berman described a new taxon from the Bromacker quarry, Rotaryus gothae, named after the Rotary Club of Gotha's contributions to the excavation of the locality. Also in 2011, Canadian paleontologists Brendan Polley and Reisz named a new species of Acheloma from the early Permian Richards Spur locality in Oklahoma, Acheloma dunni, named for Brent Dunn, one of the collectors at the locality. A study examining development changes in this species was published the previous year by Canadian paleontologists Hillary C. Maddin, Jason S. Anderson, and Reisz, although the species name was not formalized by the time of that publication. In their 2014 review of the earlier temnospondyls, Schoch & Milner resurrected a second species of Phonerpeton, P. whitei, following Olson's original species distinctions. Data from the pes of Acheloma cumminsi was included in a broader survey of the carpus and tarsus in temnospondyls by Dilkes in 2015. In 2018, British paleontologist Andrew R. Milner revised the N√Ω≈ôany trematopids, clarifying the complicated history of Mordex calliprepes and erecting a new taxon, Mattauschia laticeps. In 2019, a team led by American paleontologist Bryan M. Gee published the first description of computed tomography (CT) data of a trematopid in the form of a small specimen from the Richards Spur locality that they referred to cf. Acheloma.  Anatomy  Trematopids have typically been identified by the presence of a noticeably enlarged naris that is often sub-divided in Permian forms such as Acheloma. They are also among the largest of the dissorophoids, with some specimens of Acheloma exceeding 18 cm in skull length and thus being rivaled only by middle Permian dissorophids such as Anakamacops. Schoch & Milner (2014) diagnosed trematopids by the following features: (1) greatly expanded naris replacing much of the lacrimal; (2) medially situated narial flange meeting antorbital bar; (3) otic notch with a ventral margin sloping at less than 45-degrees in large individuals; (4) a medial inflection of the rim of the adductor fossa; (5) a pterygoid-vomer contact; (6) a triangular patch of denticles on the basal plate of the parasphenoid; and (7) a humerus with a supinator process. Milner (2018) further refined this based on his restudy of Mordex, including only characters 1, 3, and 5 from Schoch & Milner (2014), noting that some typical trematopid features are either not known or are not present in the primitive Mattauschia and Mordex. The function of the naris remains largely unresolved. Olson (1941) suggested that the anterior half served the typical function of smell detection and that the posterior half housed some kind of gland. Bolt (1974) conjectured that the well-developed nasal flange was probably for distribution of stresses throughout the skull and might be a hallmark of terrestrial dissorophoids. He then suggested that there might be a gland related to salt excretion (the \\"glandula nasalis externa\\") that would produce the enlargement of the naris. Dilkes (1993) did not discount this hypothesis, but suggested alternatives, namely that the nasal flange and the expanded naris may have been for another physiological function, such as improving respiratory efficiency and water retention, an important attribute for a terrestrial amphibian to have. However, all of these hypotheses remain speculative in the absence of much complexity of the hard tissues surrounding the naris and given the relatively vague paleoecological information available for trematopids (e.g., diet).  Relationships  The placement of trematopids within Dissorophoidea has long been accepted, as has their close relationship to dissorophids, although Olsoniformes was not formalized until 2007. Ecolsonia and Mordex have been more uncertainly placed in their history of study, but both are now accepted as unequivocal trematopids. The two most recent phylogenetic analyses of Trematopidae are those by Berman et al. (2011) and Polley & Reisz (2011): Topology of Berman et al.

Darts career A noted soft-tip player, Rodr√≠guez's first foray into the professional steel-tip darts scene was participating in the two PDPA Players Championship events in Gibraltar in January 2007; in the latter of these he placed in the last 16. Two months later, he would win the Gibraltar Open. Rodr√≠guez then attempted to qualify for the BDO World Championship in November but failed, and in the same month he failed to make any headway in the World Masters. In 2008 he decided to join the Professional Dart Players Association, enabling him to play in PDC events. Because he is based in Spain, he is unable to travel to every event on the PDC Pro Tour, however a couple of last 16 placings in Players Championship events and UK Open regionals meant he qualified for the UK Open, his first appearance on television. He entered at the last 96 stage, but was beaten 6-1 by Paul Cooper. In October, he tried to qualify for the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts but was defeated in the early rounds. Later that month however, Rodr√≠guez began to finally make significant gains in the PDC. In the second of two Players Championship events in Scotland, he reached his first PDC quarter-final before being defeated by the eventual winner James Wade.PDC website report - Wade Ends Drought In Scotland from the Professional Darts Corporation, retrieved 31-10-2008 The run of form continued in October as Rodr√≠guez reached the final of the German Darts Trophy, beating noted veterans Peter Manley and Kevin Painter 3-0 in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, before being defeated in a last leg decider by Colin Osborne.PDC website report - Wizard Wins Germany Darts Trophy from the Professional Darts Corporation, retrieved 31-10-2008 This performance guaranteed Rodr√≠guez's place in the inaugural European Championship and the 2009 PDC World Championship. Less than a week later Rodr√≠guez, in a major upset, defeated the world number five Terry Jenkins in the opening round of the 2008 European Championship,PDC website report - PartyPoker.net European Championship - Day One from the Professional Darts Corporation, retrieved 31-10-2008 but lost to Ronnie Baxter in the next round. Rodr√≠guez began his 2009 PDC World Championship campaign with a 3-2 win over then world number 16 Roland Scholten of the Netherlands to safely carry him through the second round, but he was then beaten 1-4 by Painter. At the 2010 World Championship, he was defeated 0-3 by Steve Beaton in the first round. He teamed up with Antonio Alcinas to represent Spain at the 2010 PDC World Cup of Darts. They defeated Japan in the first round, before knocking out the top seeds England (represented by the world's top two players, Phil Taylor and James Wade) 6‚Äì5 in the second round. In the group stage, they lost to Wales but defeated the United States and Scotland to qualify for the semi-finals, where they were whitewashed 0‚Äì4 by the Netherlands. He partnered Alcinas again in the 2012 World Cup, but they could not repeat their success of 2010 as they were beaten 2‚Äì5 by South Africa in the first round. In the rest of 2012 his best results in ProTour events were runs to the last 64, which he did three times. Rodriguez qualified for the 2013 World Championship by winning the West European Qualifying Event with a 6‚Äì5 victory over Stefan Couwenberg in the final. He lost to John Bowles by four legs to two in the preliminary round, as he hit just 14% of his darts at a double. After the tournament Rodriquez was ranked world number 111, meaning he had lost his place on the tour and therefore entered Q School in order to regain a tour card for PDC events in 2013. However, he could not advance past the last 64 on any of the four days and will not have automatic entry into any PDC event in 2013. Rodr√≠guez played with Antonio Alcinas for the third time in the World Cup of Darts and they qualified from Group D courtesy of a 5‚Äì3 win over Italy. They then repeated their 2010 shock win over the Scottish pair of Gary Anderson and Robert Thornton this time 5‚Äì4 and faced Richie Burnett and Mark Webster in the quarter-finals. Alcinas lost to Webster 3‚Äì4, but Rodr√≠guez beat Burnett by the same scoreline to mean a doubles match was needed to settle the tie. Spain took an early 2‚Äì1 lead but went on to be defeated 2‚Äì4. In the second round of the 2014 edition of the event, Rodr√≠guez and Alcinas lost their singles matches against the Dutch pair of Michael van Gerwen and Raymond van Barneveld to exit the tournament. Rodr√≠guez was beaten in the final of the 2016 Alcalas Open by Julio Barbero. Rodr√≠guez quit the PDC in January 2017.

It is a recollection of the author's friendship with Paul Wittgenstein, the nephew of Ludwig Wittgenstein and a member of the wealthy Viennese Wittgenstein family. Paul suffers from an unnamed mental illness for which he is repeatedly hospitalized, paralleling Bernhard's own struggle with a chronic lung disease. Synopsis The author narrates moments of his friendship with Paul Wittgenstein, \\"nephew\\" (actually son of a first cousin) of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (not to be confused with the latter's brother, the pianist Paul Wittgenstein). The title is a reference to Diderot's Rameau's Nephew who also deals with the eccentric nephew of a preeminent cultural figure. A very sensitive man, unsuitable for the world, obsessed by an exclusive and cruel passion for music as well as for race cars and sailing, Paul Wittgenstein dissipated his whole fortune and ultimately died poor. The friendship strengthened whilst recovering in a hospital, Bernhard from a lung ailment, Paul from a bout of madness. The latter in fact will die alone in an asylum, a victim of an incurable conflict with the world; whereas the former will succeed in controlling his own madness, emblem of that very conflict, and making it a lever for his sense of social living. Through the narration of symptomatic episodes, Bernhard unravels the emptiness of Austrian society, its parasitic and vain aspects, spending its time to self-congratulate on fake recognitions and futile prizes with the same rhythm used to blather and drink coffee in the best Viennese caf√©s. Finally, the author gives some interesting advice about the importance of literary prizes as the determining factor of artistic worth: \\"a prize is invariably only awarded by incompetent people who want to piss on your head and who do copiously piss on your head if you accept their prize.\\" References * Bernhardiana, a Critical Anthology of Bernhard's works * \\"An Introduction to Thomas Bernhard\\", by Thomas Cousineau (2001) * The Novels of Thomas Bernhard by J.J.

Life Ellis, the son of John Ellis from Aberystwyth, studied at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth from 1889 and won a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford in 1893. Family reasons meant that he did not take up the place at Oxford until 1898; he was re-awarded a scholarship on the recommendation of the historian Reginald Lane-Poole. He obtained his BA in 1902 and his MA in 1908. His main research at Oxford and thereafter was the collection of material on the life and work of Edward Lhuyd. Some of it was published in 1906/1907 in the Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion under the title Some incidents in the life of Edward Lhuyd. His work was unfinished at his death, and he left his papers to the university library in Aberystwyth. In 1907, Ellis was appointed to run the Welsh library at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and in 1908 he was appointed the principal assistant to Sir John Ballinger, the first librarian of the National Library of Wales. He was not happy in this post and returned to Oxford in 1912 with a research scholarship. He also worked at the Codrington Library at All Souls College, Oxford, and was the only assistant librarian between 1916 and the end of the First World War. In the early 1920s, Ellis returned to Oxford, making trips to Dublin and Oxford for his research. It was on one of these visits to Oxford that he died in 1928; he was buried in Aberystwyth. Works Through his work on Lluyd, Ellis developed a knowledge of other Welshmen at Oxford. This led to Facsimiles of Letters of Oxford Welshmen (the writers including Henry Vaughan, Sir Leoline Jenkins, Ellis Wynne, Edward Samuel and Moses Williams). In 1904, he published An Elizabethan Broadside in the Welsh Language, being a Brief granted in 1591 to Sion Salusburi of Gwyddelwern, Merionethshire. He also wrote some poetry in English.

It was written by Cras during World War I and was premiered in Paris in 1922, giving Cras a burst of notoriety in the French press. Content =Text= Albert Samain The text originated as a poetic drama written by Samain in the style of Maurice Maeterlinck. The title character is Polyphemus, who, according to Greek mythology, is the eldest Cyclops and son of Poseidon. It tells the well-known story of the attempt by Polyphemus (baritone) to steal Galatea (soprano) from Acis (tenor). In the original myth Polyphemus eventually rolls a rock onto the lovers, killing Acis. Samain humanized Polyphemus, who is portrayed as an oafish but sincere figure who is at ease with children but becomes awkward when trying to communicate with adults. There is no suggestion that he is not fully human (the text makes it clear that he has two eyes), but he is portrayed as a morose and solitary forest dweller who hopelessly yearns for love. Eventually he becomes aware of the feelings shared by the two lovers and, though he looms over them with a heavy boulder, decides not to crush them. Ultimately, the cyclops puts his eyes out like Oedipus and wanders into the sea to find death because the couple's happiness together horrifies him. =Composition= Jean Cras Cras encountered Samain's dramatic poem in 1910, ten years after its author's death. He adapted it by dividing it into four rather than the original two acts and slightly pruned the longer speeches.Michel Fleury, \\"Bathed by the Sea-Wind and the Fragrance of the Woods\\", Polyph√®me, Timpani, 2003, pp.14-15. He described the work as a \\"lyric tragedy\\" rather than an opera, since there is very little action.Michel Fleury, \\"Jean Cras, an exceptional destiny\\", Polyph√®me, Timpani, 2003, pp. 15-17 The drama proceeds through a series of arcadian pastoral tableaus punctuated by Polyph√®me's long brooding soliloquies and his obsessive interrogations of Galat√©e's young brother Lycas. Cras completed the music in 1914, working on the orchestration while serving in the French navy during the Adriatic campaign of World War I. The music is impressionistic, restless, and highly chromatic, in the spirit of Chausson and Duparc. Polyph√®me's depression is marked by the use of diminished seventh chords and tortuous figures. The influence of Debussy's La Mer and his opera Pell√©as et M√©lisande is also noticeable, especially in the use of whole tone scales. Premiere The opera won the first Ville de Paris Prize in 1921, and was first performed at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris in December 1922. It was conducted by Albert Wolff and directed by Albert Carr√©. It was revived in 1924. Roles *Polyph√®me - Baritone *Galat√©e - Soprano *Acis - Tenor *Lycas - Alto *Un sylvain - Tenor *Une nymphe - Soprano *Pan - (non singing) Synopsis Act 1: Nymphs and Swains celebrate the charms of nature. Polyph√®me feels alienated and embittered because the teenage Galat√©e no longer loves him as she did when she was a child. He asks Lycas, Galat√©e's young brother, to describe her feelings. Lycas laments that Galat√©e no longer plays with him, but spends her time with her lover Acis. Polyph√®me attempts to rekindle his relationship with Galat√©e by bringing her gifts, but realises that she has no feelings for him. He frightens her when he blurts out his intense love for her and tries to stop her leaving by force, but he finally lets her go. Act 2: Galat√©e describes Polyph√®me's disturbing behaviour to Acis, who expresses his dislike of Polyph√®me. Galat√©e says he is to be pitied. The lovers canoodle together. Lycas tries to get the lovers to play with him, but they fob him off. Act 3: Polyph√®me broods over his own isolation, and forces Lycas to describe the intimacy of the lovers. Polyph√®me's bitter obsession frightens Lycas, who pleads with him not to hurt Galat√©e. Act 4: Acis and Galat√©e canoodle together once more and discuss Polyph√®me's increasingly morose behaviour. The Nymphs and Swains dance and sing of love. As Acis and Galat√©e fall asleep in each other's arms, the god Pan appears and blesses the lovers. They wake and renew their devotion to one another. Polyph√®me appears above them with a rock, overhearing the lovers' romantic intimacies, and feels his own ugliness. He leaves in despair. Acis leaves and Galat√©e ponders love as she hears a mysterious yell of pain in the forest. She falls asleep. Polyph√®me arrives, blinded. Lycas helps him to touch the sleeping Galat√©e for the last time. Polyph√®me then tells Lycas that he is going to walk into the sea.

In other words, data center assets such as storage and processing power can be provisioned (made available) to meet surges in user's needs. The concept has also been referred to as Infrastructure 2.0 and Next Generation Data Center. Concept The basic premise of dynamic infrastructures is to leverage pooled IT resources to provide flexible IT capacity, enabling the allocation of resources in line with demand from business processes. This is achieved by using server virtualization technology to pool computing resources wherever possible, and allocating these resources on-demand using automated tools. This allows for load balancing and is a more efficient approach than keeping massive computing resources in reserve to run tasks that take place, for example, once a month, but are otherwise under-utilized. Dynamic Infrastructures may also be used to provide security and data protection when workloads are moved during migrations, provisioning, enhancing performance or building co-location facilities.An overview of continuous data protection. Dynamic infrastructures were promoted to enhance performance, scalability,Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. system availability and uptime, increasing server utilization and the ability to perform routine maintenance on either physical or virtual systems all while minimizing interruption to business operations and reducing cost for IT. Dynamic infrastructures also provide the fundamental business continuity and high availability requirements to facilitate cloud or grid computing. For networking companies, infrastructure 2.0 refers to the ability of networks to keep up with the movement and scale requirements of new enterprise IT initiatives, especially virtualization and cloud computing. According to companies like Cisco, F5 Networks and Infoblox, network automation and connectivity intelligence between networks, applications and endpoints will be required to reap the full benefits of virtualization and many types of cloud computing. This will require network management and infrastructure to be consolidated, enabling higher levels of dynamic control and connectivity between networks, systems and endpoints. Early examples of server-level dynamic infrastructures are the FlexFrame for SAP and FlexFrame for Oracle introduced by Fujitsu Siemens Computers (now Fujitsu) in 2003. The FlexFrame approach was to dynamically assign servers to applications on demand, leveling peaks and enabling organizations to maximize the benefit from their IT investments.  Benefits  Dynamic infrastructures take advantage of intelligence gained across the network. By design, every dynamic infrastructure is service-oriented and focused on supporting and enabling the end users in a highly responsive way. It can utilize alternative sourcing approaches, like cloud computing to deliver new services with agility and speed. Global organizations already have the foundation for a dynamic infrastructure that will bring together the business and IT infrastructure to create new possibilities. For example: * Transportation companies can optimize their vehicles' routes leveraging GPS and traffic information. * Facilities organizations can secure access to locations and track the movement of assets by leveraging RFID technology. * Production environments can monitor and manage presses, valves and assembly equipment through embedded electronics. * Technology systems can be optimized for energy efficiency, managing spikes in demand, and ensuring disaster recovery readiness. * Communications companies can better monitor usage by location, user or function, and optimize routing to enhance user experience. * Utility companies can reduce energy usage with a \\"smart grid.\\" > Virtualized applications can reduce the cost of testing, packaging and > supporting an application by 60%, and they reduced overall TCO by 5% to 7% > in our model. ‚Äì Source: Gartner ‚Äì \\"TCO of Traditional Software Distribution > vs. Application Virtualization\\" / Michael A Silver, Terrence Cosgrove, Mark > A Margevicious, Brian Gammage / 16 April 2008 > While green issues are a primary driver in 10% of current data center > outsourcing and hosting initiatives, cost reductions initiatives are a > driver 47% of the time and are now aligned well with green goals.

A ray appears diagonally, from top left to bottom middle. Medullary rays are cellular structures found in some species of wood. They appear as radial planar structures, perpendicular to the growth rings, which are visible to the naked eye. In a transverse section they appear as radiating lines from the centre of the log. In an axial section they may appear as a variety of transverse markings, depending on how close the section is to the plane of the ray. In a tangential section they may be hard to see at all. They are formed by the activity of fascicular cambium. During the process of the division of cambium, the cambium cuts out cells on both the outer and inner side. These cells are parenchymatous. Most of these cells transform into xylem and phloem. But certain cells don't transform into xylem and phloem and remain as such. These cells cut out by the cambium towards the periphery are phloem parenchyma while those towards the pith are xylem parenchyma. Both of these cells together work as secondary medullary rays. These medullary or pith rays are essential for the radial conduction of the water, minerals and other organic substances. They transport the substances from centre to periphery. These rays are also known as vascular rays or pith rays. In this context, the term refers to radial sheets or ribbons extending vertically through the tree across and perpendicular to the growth rings. Also called pith rays or wood rays, these formations of primarily parenchyma cells allow the radial transport of sap and are essential in the process of tylosis. In quartersawn material, where the wood is cut into boards with the growth rings roughly perpendicular to the face of the board, the medullary rays often produce beautiful figure such as silver grain, medullary spots, pith flecks, etc. References Category:Plant anatomy pl:Promie≈Ñ rdzeniowy ","title":"Medullary ray (botany)"},{"id":"20013030","text":"In anatomy, the medullary ray (Ferrein's pyramid) is the middle part of the cortical lobule or renal lobule, consisting of a group of straight tubes connected to the collecting ducts.

Sundanese students in the STOVIA (School Tot Opleiding Voor Indlandsche Artsen) - Dutch East Indies' era medical school in Batavia (Jakarta), attempted to make the Sundanese people's organization. Next, the students aged about 22 years old, visit Daeng Kandoeroean Ardiwinata residence, who regarded as the Sundanese elders. In the visits, they stated purpose of the establishment of the organization at the same time ask D. K. Ardiwinata to become head of the organization. After D. K. Ardiwinata agreed, in Jakarta, on Sunday 20 July 1913 they held a meeting for the establishment of clubs. In the meeting, the establishment of the organization was agreed and they named the organization \\"Pagoejoeban Pasoendan.\\" They also set D. K. Ardiwinata as advisors and Dajat Hidajat (STOVIA's student) as chairman. Between 1931 and 1942, Paguyuban Pasundan had a great reputation under the leadership of Oto Iskandar di Nata, Indonesian national hero. Today, Paguyuban Pasundan's activities are dominated by activity in the field of education and socio-cultural.

Life Petyt was born in 1640 or 1641 in the village of Storiths, near Bolton Abbey, Skipton, Yorkshire,. and educated at the Free Grammar School (now Ermysted's Grammar School), Skipton, and Christ's College, Cambridge. He was admitted as a barrister to the Middle Temple in June 1660, and to Barnard's Inn in June 1661. He was specially admitted to the Inner Temple on 25 November 1664, and subsequently called to the Bar there in February 1671 and made a bencher in 1689. He served as Treasurer (that is, the head) of Inner Temple in 1701‚Äì1702.. On 25 July 1689, Petyt was appointed Keeper of the records at the Tower of London by William III,. replacing in that position Robert Brady who had made a very effective attack for the Tories on Petyt's The Antient Right of the Commons of England Asserted (1680).Alan Harding, England in the Thirteenth Century (1993), p. 29. Petyt was attacked also from his own side, the Whigs, by Thomas Hunt.Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), pp. 457‚Äì458. Petyt wrote against the separation of powers, and in favour of Parliament's control of the judiciary.Jeffrey Denys Goldsworthy, The Sovereignty of Parliament: History and Philosophy (1999), p. 153. Influential in its time, in particular on John Locke, was a version of \\"ancient constitutionalism\\" propounded in the writings of John Sadler, James Tyrrell and Petyt.John Marshall, John Locke: Resistance, Religion and Responsibility (1994), p. 278. Petyt died unmarried in Chelsea, London, on 3 October 1707, and was buried in the west part of Temple Church.. In his will he left ¬£50 to the Free Grammar School in Skipton which was used to purchase books for needy students. He also left ¬£200 for the maintenance of alumni of the Free Grammar School who had been admitted as scholars at Christ's College, Cambridge.. In addition, he entrusted to his trustees his books and manuscripts together with ¬£150 for buying or building a place to preserve them. Inner Temple Library was enlarged for this purpose, and in 1708 Petyt's trustees deposited his collection there, except for about 2,000 items which his brother Sylvester (1640‚Äì1719) took to his home in Yorkshire.. Sylvester, who also attended the Free Grammar School, eventually bequeathed to the school the generous sum of ¬£30,000 to form the Petyt Trust, and also books belonging to himself, his brother and friends which became the Petyt Library. Legacy Modern verdicts on Petyt as a historian have been harsh. David C. DouglasDavid C. Douglas, The English Scholars (1939), p. 163. comments that he and William Atwood, though distinguished jurists, \\"took what was worst\\" from the earlier works of their century on constitutional history.

It will have a total capacity of 71,5 MW. Construction is expected to last 4 years. The project raises several environmental concerns, including threats on the survival of the Balkan lynx.The hydropower plant Boskov Most. CEE Bankwatch. May 2014, Retrieved 20 August 2014. Project details The project is being developed by Elektrani na Makedinija (ESM), a 100% state owned electric power utility of Macedonia responsible for mining and power generation. As of 2020, the public company operates 554 MW of hydropower capacity, representing 40% of its total installed power generation capacity. Bo≈°kov Most HPP is intended to utilise the hydro power potential of Mala Reka river and 6 of its tributaries. The facility will include a rock-filled embankment dam and its accumulation reservoir near the village of Tresonƒçe, and a 71.5 MW power station located lower in the valley, near Mogorƒçe. Water will be conveyed from the first to the latter by a 8,750 m long and 3.3 m diameter underground penstock, and from six smaller water intakes on Mala Reka tributaries via supply canals totalling 10.7 km. It will generate an estimated 117 GWh of power per year, according to the preliminary design studies. The total cost of the project was estimated ‚Ç¨144 million as of 2019, rising from ‚Ç¨84 million in 2011, and ‚Ç¨107 million in 2014.  History  Plans to build the Bo≈°kov Most HPP date back to 1983 (as a substantially smaller 45 MW facility) but it was postponed several times due to financial problems. The project under its current design started in 2010. In November 2011, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) signed on loaning a country ‚Ç¨65 million for the construction of the project. The rest is to be provided by the AD Elektrani na Makedonija (ESM). The EBRD cancelled its loan in January 2017, after a seven-year environmental activism campaign again the project, led by biologist Ana Colovic Lesoska. Importance for the Macedonian energy sector As of 2020, only 26.6% of technically usable hydropower potential in North Macedonia has been developed, which remains far under the European average of ~50%. Unfavourable energy mix, strong dependence on energy import, obsolete energy system and inefficiency in energy production and use are the main problems of the Macedonian energy sector. Macedonia imports roughly a quarter of its annual electricity needs. Domestic energy production is based mainly on the low-quality domestic lignite, biomass and hydro. The purpose of the Bo≈°kov most HPP is to support Macedonia's drive to improve the security and quality of its energy supplies, as well as promoting renewable sources of energy generation. Once operating, the plant will enable the nation to reduce electricity imports and in addition decrease the carbon intensity of the Macedonian generation sector. It will also help North Maceonia meet its widely accepted objective to reach 20% energy production from renewable sources. Bo≈°kov Most HPP is conceived as a peaking power plant, operating near rated capacity around 5 hours daily during peak demand. Controversial issues =Environmental impact= The Mavrovo National Park is one of the oldest national parks in Europe, famous for its pristine nature. The park hosts more than 1,000 different plant species. Trout species, wolves, bears and otters are an important part of the ecosystem. The park is also a centre of the remaining population of the Balkan Lynx, an endangered subspecies of the Eurasian Lynx. The territory where it moves is thus a critical habitat and represents an area where measures for protection and preservation of this species should be undertaken. Putting any additional stress on this source population may lead to the extinction of the species. Bo≈°kov HPP is designed to produce peak energy which means that the water from Mala Reka river and its tributaries will be diverted into a reservoir and on demand released once a day. Aside from the fact that the entire valley will suffer from the diversion of the majority of its natural water supplies, it will also result in daily flushes, which have enormous negative impacts on biodiversity and species populations in the river sections below the HPP. =Legal issues= The Environmental impact assessment prepared for the project is lacking significant information vital for the precise and objective evaluation of the impact of the project on the environment, specifically data on the mammals in the project area and complete absence of the Balkan lynx from the study. The project is also not in accordance with Law on Nature protection specifically with Article 74, which does not envisage the use of natural resources for energy as a part of national park management and Article 75 which lists the prohibited activities in the national park. Furthermore, the project is not in accordance with the following international conventions signed and ratified by the government of Macedonia: Bern Convention, Bonn Convention and Convention on Biodiversity. =Funding plan cancellation= After over five years of campaigns against the Boskov Most project, CEE Bankwatch along with its member groups, Macedonian center for environmental research and information, Eko-svest, and Macedonian environmental lawyer association, Front 21/42, finally welcomed the cancellation of the project. In 2015, just few days after the Berne Convention decision on Mavrovo, the World Bank withdrew its funds from the Lukovo Pole project, thus preventing the project from being realised. It took the EBRD another year to cancel its EUR 65 million loan for Bo≈°kov Most as well, stating that it fully respects Bern Convention‚Äôs recommendation and believes that the project should be suspended.

It is produced in either hydropower plants or thermal power plants that burn imported natural gas. In winter, when river levels are relatively low and demand for electricity is high, country has to import more natural gas, resulting in higher prices of electricity. Electricity cuts, especially in winter are common. Khudoni dam would, according to government, accumulate summer excess water and used it to generate additional power during the rest of the year. However, the adequacy of the investments in hydro for the purpose of impeding the electricity shortage in winter has been questioned since Georgia will still have to resort to expensive thermal generation and imports of natural gas in dry winter months. Nevertheless, if compensation measures for loss of biodiversity and cultural heritage are implemented according to international best practice, Khudoni HPP could act as a driver of regional conservation and development.

Khudoni HPP project presupposes resettling around 2000 people which will have a devastating impact on Svans living in the area. So far no resettlement plan was released.Environmental & social impacts of the Khudoni hydropower project. CEE Bankwatch, March 2014. Retrieved on 2014-30-06.

There is a need to clearly distinct among different groups of affected people and design a tailored made package of livelihood restoration accordingly. Such flaws in procedures for resettlement planning and lack of information have resulted in significant distrust of the population in government and investor. = Indigenous Svan Communities = On 5 March 2018, representatives of all 17 communities of Upper Svaneti gathered in Mestia for a traditional Svan Council meeting, Lalkhor, to oppose the development of gold mining and hydropower projects in Svaneti that threaten local livelihoods and ecosystems.https://bankwatch.org/blog/svan-communities-block-hydro- development-in-svanetia  Indigenous Svan communities unite to block hydro development in Svaneti  05.03.2018 The protesters restated their demands ‚Äì discontinuation of over 50 dam projects, including the Nenskra hydro power plant, Nenskra dams, and the Mestiachala hydropower plant.

The Lalkhor demands to recognize Svans as ancient, indigenous, aboriginal, autochthonic people with appropriate rights for customary and community property in Svaneti and to ban development of any infrastructure without their prior consent. https://bankwatch.org/blog/svan- communities-block-hydro-development-in-svanetia  Indigenous Svan communities unite to block hydro development in Svaneti  05.03.2018 =Environmental impact= Environmentalists remain sceptical about the Khudoni HPP project. The sub-alpine forests and meadows of the upper river Inguri basin is an area well known for its endemic wildlife. The species that are often found here include different forest birds, large raptors and other endemic birds. Mountain goats, chamois, brown bear, wolf, lynx, roe deer and wild boar are also quite common. Flooding of the reservoir area will cause the devastation of forests and wildlife habitat, the loss of river species populations and the degradation of upstream catchments areas. Even though there is no official protected status in Svaneti, the rich biological diversity of the unique area would be irreparably impacted by Khudoni HPP. Cumulative impact Cumulative environmental impact assessment of existing and potential hydro power plants on the Inguri river has been done, but it only includes areas downstream from the proposed Khudoni dam. With more plans to construct hydro power plants on Inguri, the cumulative impact of all of them will result in negative effect on biodiversity and water quality.Khudoni hydropower plant ‚Äì a risky deal. CEE Bankwatch, November 2011. Retrieved on 2014-30-06. =Lifespan of the reservoir= Due to outdated data (measurements from 1966 to 1986 were used) and the fluctuation of the inflow of sediments, inadequate assessment of the lifespan of the reservoir has been made. There is strong evidence that the volume of the sediment inflow is much higher, since the construction of the new 20 km road was not included in the measurements. Furthermore, the slopes around reservoir are unstable which can further shorten the lifespan of the reservoir. There is a need to redo the measurements of sediment inflow and to develop mitigation measures to avoid landslides and rock falls into the reservoir area.

Nuffield Mechanizations Crusader tanks in Western Desert, 26 November 1941 Origin Nuffield Mechanizations Limited was incorporated in the mid-1930s, probably as Wolseley Aero Engines Limited. Wolseley had begun aero engine development in 1929 but when Wolseley Motors became a subsidiary of Morris Motors Limited on 1 July 1935 it had been decided to keep aero engine development quite separate. So this business remained Lord Nuffield's personal property and did not become part of the Morris Motors group. Mending defence In 1935 at the personal request of the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, Lord Nuffield took on the job of bringing up-to- date the mechanization of the Army and the ground section of the Air Force. The result was that the Wolseley Aero Engine plant would manufacture tank engines and that research units were established there to work on new ideas to improve the mechanization and mobility of the Army.James Leasor, Wheels to Fortune, Cornwall UK, Stratus, 2001 Aero engines The 27-litre Liberty L-12 was used as a tank engine Development and production of Wolseley aero engines was stopped in September 1936.H A Taylor & D H Middleton, Airspeed Aircraft since 1931, London, Putnam Aeronautical, 1991 They were developing an advanced Wolseley radial aero engine of about 250 horsepower but the project was abandoned in September 1936 when Lord Nuffield got from the Air Ministry the fixed price Intention to Proceed (ITP) contract papers which he believed would have required \\"an army of chartered accountants\\". Lord Nuffield decided he would deal only with the War Office and Admiralty and not the Air Ministry (see Airspeed). Tanks During World War II Nuffield Mechanizations was engaged in military production. Among their activities was production of the Liberty L-12 engine for use in British tanks of the period. In 1939 one of their subsidiaries was given the opportunity to take part in production of the Covenanter tank then being designed but opted to develop their own version of the design which became the Crusader tank. It is reported that these tanks were under-gunned and notoriously unreliable. They were withdrawn from front- line service in 1942Steven Parissien,, The Life of the Automobile: The Complete History of the Motor Car, Thomas Dunne New York, 2015 ; Crusader III saw the introduction of the Mk. IV Liberty engine, fixing many of the reliability issues previously encountered. Nuffield Mechanizations followed this with the Cavalier tank which also used the Liberty engine. Though the tank was put into production the power of the Liberty engine was limited and because of the increase in tank weight the Cavalier was not used in combat. The last tank the Liberty engine was produced for was the A27L Centaur tank, effectively an underpowered Cromwell tank.

Upon his early death, he left a legacy of 20,000 guilders for the building of a public library (\\"tot publycque dienst der studie\\") with a custodian's dwelling. Designed by the architect Arent van ‚Äòs-Gravensande, the building follows the Dutch Classical style and is regarded as one of the jewels of Dutch 17th-century architecture. Bibliotheca Thysiana is one of the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites. It is distinguished by its balanced proportions and the purity of its Ionic order on top of a high basement. The Bibliotheca Thysiana is the only surviving 17th century example in the Netherlands of a building that was designed as a public library. It is quite extraordinary that a complete private 17th century library has been preserved and thus offers a good impression of the book collection of a young, learned bibliophile from the period of late Humanism. The collection contains about 2,500 books and thousands of pamphlets in all scientific fields. The library also houses one of the 14 still existing bookwheels in the world. The library has a separate special collection of several hundred books from and about Emanuel Swedenborg.

Early life and career Born in India to Air Vice-Marshal E. J. Cuckney and his wife Lilian, Cuckney was educated at Shrewsbury School. He read medicine at the University of St Andrews, returning after service with the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and the King's African Rifles during World War II to study history and economics. He was recruited by MI5, with whom he served until 1959. Cuckney's time in MI5 featured in Peter Wright's book Spycatcher, where Wright described him as \\"a tough, no-nonsense\\" officer. Business and public service After leaving MI5, he worked in the City at stockbroking firm Standard Industrial Group, before joining merchant bank Lazards, where he became the first director to resign in over 100 years. He then established Anglo-Eastern Bank with Sir David Alliance, specialising in trade finance between Britain and the Middle East. Cuckney was appointed chairman of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board in 1970, which he restructured and restored to viability following the possibility of insolvency. He left in 1972 to become the first chief executive of the Property Services Agency, set up to manage the government's property estate. In 1974 he moved to the Crown Agents, which was in financial difficulty following the secondary banking crisis of 1973‚Äì1975. He joined as chairman and separated out the military sales arm as International Military Services (a Ministry of Defence company), which he also became chairman of and served until 1985. He left the Crown Agents in 1978, and briefly joined the Port of London Authority before being knighted. He subsequently became director and/or chairman of various companies, including travel company Thomas Cook, Midland Bank, tea company Brooke Bond, engineering firm John Brown, helicopter manufacturer Westland, Royal Insurance, Investors in Industry (later 3i), pharmaceutical company Glaxo, and Orion Publishing Group. Westland affair and Maxwell scandal Cuckney had gained a reputation as a \\"the company doctor who never lost a patient\\" following his involvement with the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, Crown Agents, and John Brown. His appointment in 1985 as chairman of Westland, when the company was facing bankruptcy, saw him become involved in the 1985‚Äì1986 Westland affair, a political scandal for Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party government. Cuckney, with Thatcher, favoured a merger with the American company Sikorsky, while the Secretary of State for Defence Michael Heseltine favoured a European merger. The American option prevailed, and the affair led to Heseltine's resignation. In 1992 he was appointed as an advisor to Peter Lilley, Secretary of State for Social Security, following the death of Robert Maxwell and the discovery that he had stolen hundreds of millions of pounds from his companies' pension funds. He headed the Maxwell Pensioners' Trust and in 1995, brokered a ¬£276 million out-of-court settlement, known as the Major Settlement, between the pension schemes and those institutions against which the schemes had potential legal claims. He was created a life peer in 1995 as Baron Cuckney, of Millbank in the City of Westminster, sitting as a Conservative in the House of Lords.

The first volume deals with two lovers trapped on an island where a Black Gas has turned the residents into zombie-like monsters. The second volume deals with the effects of the Black Gas on the mainland.  Publication history  Each issue was published with one standard and three variant covers (Terror, Gore, and Wraparound). The first issue also received a \\"Blood Foil\\" variant cover that was initially only available at conventions but later sold through Avatar's website. Plot  =Volume 1= Tyler and his girlfriend Soo travel to Tyler's hometown, Smoky Island, to meet his parents. After arriving, Soo is told the enigmatic history of Smoky Island; it is considered to be a lost colony and the original inhabitants of the island were all wiped out by what historians speculate to be some sort of civil war, where many were dismembered and sexually violated. After a brief meeting with Tyler's parents, the young couple retreat into a cabin away from town that's located on the other side of the Island's mountainous bulge. Shortly after arriving at the cabin, an earthquake occurs that releases an ominous Black Gas away from the cabin and down on the town. Recalling some of the old legends of Smoky Island, Tyler arms himself and both he and Soo go to investigate what affect the gas has had on the island's inhabitants. As they make their way down the mountain, Soo and Tyler quickly discover that the people of the island are no longer human; they have become psychotic cannibalistic monsters with black ooze leaking out of their eye sockets. After battling their way through the woods and the town, Soo and Tyler arrive at his parent's place only to discover that every one on the island, including Tyler's mother and father, have been transformed. The duo battle their way through a mob of monsters and discover Doctor Menlove, a person they had met earlier in the story before the gas was released by the earthquake. The doctor's transformation has been delayed because he was high on marijuana when the Black Gas came; he explains that the chemicals make the mind and body change, creating an insatiable hunger and a primitive desire to eat and kill. He gives them the keys to his boat and then begs for death. As Tyler and Soo battle off a group of islanders, the doctor warns them that the toxin from the Black Gas is excreted from the tears and saliva of the infected. The couple makes a break for the boat but once they escape the island, Soo realises that Tyler has become infected and she has to kill him. The horror doesn't end there, Soo approaches the mainland (possibly somewhere in New England) only to see the city ablaze and in a state of anarchy. =Volume 2= Soo arrives in the city and sees it is just like the island. She encounters a pair of police officers, Johnny Rader and Wilmont, and explains to them what happened on Smoky Island and how the toxins are spread. Wilmont has been bitten and Soo quickly puts a bullet through his brain after a standoff between Wilmont and Rader. A helicopter flies overhead but rather than offer help it drops a bomb on the hospital where uninfected were taking refuge and then begins tailing Soo and Rader. The two are able to escape the chopper and take cover in an abandoned building. Rader uses his squad car radio to request an evacuation but a monster driving a car destroys the rescue helicopter and their squad car. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Rader decides that no one can be allowed to escape the area. He shoots Soo, whose mind has snapped from the horror, puts on riot armour, arms himself to the teeth, and goes on the offensive. Rader begins annihilating the monsters by blowing up gas stations and buildings, only to look up and see a B-2 stealth bomber drop a nuclear device on the city. The explosion creates a giant cloud of Black Gas that begins spreading over the entire planet. Zombies Throughout the series the characters frequently refer to the monsters as Zombies; however they do not fit the classical definitions of being reanimated corpses or will-less people controlled by another. The Black Gas transforms people and animals into aggressive murderous carnivores that seem indifferent to most injury, but they are definitely not mindless and in fact carry on conversations with their victims. The monsters are aware of their acts yet are unable to help themselves. In some cases they express regret at what they are doing yet are unable to stop, whereas others seem to show no remorse whatsoever. The infection is spread by the monsters through saliva and tears, so being bitten can transform a regular person into a monster. The solicitations for the series also advertise it as a \\"full-color zombie epic!‚Äù Ellis has said \\"The Warren Ellis zombie, in its early phase, is actually aware of what's happening to its brain and body. In its early phase, the 'Blackgas' zombie can actually talk.\\"Isle Of Zombies: Warren Ellis talks \\"Blackgas\\", Comic Book Resources, 7 November 2005 Although there are classic elements of the zombie genre (cannibalism and the bite spreading the infection) Ellis has concentrated on other aspects stating \\"the big thing is psychological: the black gas releases the worst things in our heads. They don't just eat people. They do utterly disgusting things. All that black stuff in the back of our brains that we never act on... That all comes out. They're out of control, but technically they're not mindless.

It is based in Begunje na Gorenjskem, Slovenia.  History  In 1978 the first DG-100 license-built for the ELAN company, a single-seat sailplane, was built by a team of Elan employees at the German company Glaser-Dirks in Bruchsal, Germany. Long-term licensing with Glaser Dirks and later DG Flugzeugbau continued. In the then ELAN factory at Begunje glider models DG-100 Elan, DG-300 Elan, DG-500 Elan and DG-1000 were made. The company AMS Flights d.o.o. was established in 1999 to continue the existing aircraft production and took over the entire ELAN FLIGHT division of Elan on 1 September that year. The company‚Äôs manufacturing facilities are located at Begunje, in the northwest part of Slovenia, close to the borders with Austria and Italy. On 14 November 2001 AMS took over from Technoflug GmbH the production of the Carat motorglider. The Carat is a single-seat, powered glider with the engine in the nose. The Carat was designed in Germany for long-range cruising flights and for soaring. The Magnus, a two-seat, side-by- side version of the Carat is under development by AMS. The AMS product range expanded with the acquisition of the Apis ULA / Sport Class motor-glider program of the Slovenian company Albastar on 30 July 2003. Manufacturing of the Apis continued in AMS until serial number 52. In 2005/06 AMS took over the license for the German-designed sailplanes Rolladen-Schneider LS4 and LS6. These types and their planned developments replaced the manufacture of the DG-300 and DG-500, which was being run down. In 2007 production of the Apis and Bee gliders was transferred to Pipistrel.  Aircraft produced  To July 2008, Elan and AMS had built the following gliders and aircraft parts: * DG-100 ELAN: 58 sailplanes * DG-101 ELAN: 164 sailplanes * DG-300 ELAN: 444 sailplanes * DG-303 ELAN: 67 sailplanes * DG-500 ELAN: 139 gliders * DG-505 ELAN: 121 gliders * DG-1000S, DG-1000T: 48 sailplanes (AMS works: fuselage lamination and complete sailplane: rough assembly, surfaces finish and final assembly) * Carat A: 26 motor-gliders * Apis, Bee: 40 gliders * LS4-b: 2 sailplanes * Composite components: wings, tailplanes, rudders: over 230 sets for Sky Arrow 450, Sky Arrow 650TC/TCN, Sinus, Virus  Production line  AMS is the sole owner and manufacturer of the Carat.

Attaway's own family was part of this population shift from South to North when he was a child. His novel follows the Moss brothers as they escape the inequality of sharecropping in the South only to encounter inequality in the mills of the North. Their story illustrates the tragedy and hardships many Black Americans faced during the Great Migration. Blood on the Forge touches on themes such as the destruction of nature, the emptiness and hunger that the working characters experience, the complications of the individual in a depersonalized world, and the myth of the American Dream.  Background  During his childhood in the 1910s, author William Attaway traveled with his family from the segregated south of Mississippi to the northern city of Chicago, Illinois; in doing so his family became part of what would be known as the Great Migration.Bader, Philipo. (2004). Attaway, William. African-American Writers. Infobase Publishing. . pp. 7‚Äì8.Bland, Sterling Lecater. (2004). \\"Fire and Romance: African American Literature\\". In Josephine Hendin (Ed.), A Concise Companion to Postwar American Literature and Culture (p. 267). John Wiley & Sons. . From 1910 to 1930, approximately six million African Americans moved from the rural southern United States to the industrialized North. The northern states of Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, New York and Michigan received the majority of the migrating African Americans. Factors motivating blacks to migrate north included the plentiful job opportunities in Northern industry, and the desire to escape the harsh racial climate of the South. As a result, neighborhoods in Northern cities saw drastic changes in population and an increase in issues concerning housing. Many cultural movements were spawned due to the large influx in black populations in the North, including the Harlem Renaissance and the spread of jazz music.Reich, Steven Andrew (2006). Encyclopedia of the great Black migration p. 617 Greenwood Press. . Plot summary ;Part One The novel opens in Kentucky, in the year 1919; sharecropping half-brothers Big Mat, Chinatown, and Melody Moss are in dire straits. After their mule dragged their mother to her death, Big Mat killed the animal in a fit of rage. Now without a mule, the brothers are unable to work their land, and are likely to starve. The landowner, Mr. Johnston, agrees to give the brothers another mule. When Big Mat goes to Mr. Johnston's riding boss to collect the mule he had been promised, the riding boss refuses to give him the mule, and makes a racist comment about the departed Mrs. Moss. Big Mat's anger again overcomes him and he attacks and possibly kills the riding boss. Earlier that day, Chinatown and Melody are visited by a white man on horseback who gives them a ten-dollar bill, promising much more if the brothers leave that night on a train that would take them North, to work. When Big Mat returns that evening and Melody and Chinatown tell him what the stranger said, Big Mat decides that he and his brothers will head North that very evening. ;Part Two Part Two, the shortest of the novel, chronicles the inhumane conditions of the train in which the Moss brothers are shipped north to Pennsylvania. ;Part Three The Moss brothers arrive at a mill town near Pittsburgh, where they get work in the steel mill and live together in a bunkhouse with the other workers of the mill. On their time off, Chinatown and Melody go to a Mexican madam named Sugar Mama, where they meet her niece Anna, whom Melody becomes infatuated with. Chinatown and Melody convince Big Mat to come with them to a dog fight. When Anna rushes into the ring to prevent the death of one of the dogs, she is hit by the dog's owner. Big Mat responds by punching the man, which leads to a riot. After the fight breaks up, Anna rushes up to Big Mat and kisses him before running away again. Big Mat takes Anna away from Sugar Mamma and sets up house with her in a small shack. Melody brings a letter from Big Mat's wife Hattie to the shack only to find Anna there alone. When he tells Anna about the letter she tries to snatch it from him; the two wrestle over the letter. The struggle culminates in Melody raping Anna. There is a catastrophic accident at the mill that kills 14 men and blinds Chinatown. After this tragedy, the labor union becomes very active and gains many new members. The atmosphere of the town becomes increasingly hostile as the foreign mill workers come to resent the African American workers, who are the only group that refuse to join the union. Big Mat is recruited by the sheriff, who is impressed with Big Mat's strength, to be a deputy and help combat the growing union. Once deputized, Mat is told that he is a boss in the town; after a lifetime of oppression, this new feeling of authority goes to Big Mat's head like fresh whiskey. Melody decides to cheer Chinatown up after his accident by taking him to visit some prostitutes. Once at the brothel, Melody finds out that Anna has been working there. Melody returns home and tries to convince Anna to run away with him. When Big Mat overhears them, he once again is overpowered by his rage and beats Anna with his brass-studded belt. Later that night Big Mat, along with the sheriff and his deputies, raid the union headquarters. In the midst of the action, Big Mat is repeatedly hit on the back of the head with a pickaxe handle by a young Slavic union member. Big Mat is killed by the blows. The book ends with Melody and Chinatown leaving the mill town as they take a train to Pittsburgh, where they plan to rebuild their lives. Genre = Proletarian literature = Blood on the Forge is an example of proletarian literature, a genre whose works usually represented the years surrounding the Great Depression. The experience of the characters in the novel mirror the class struggles during the Great Migration, specifically the hardships of African American workers during this period. The Moss brothers are realistically depicted as \\"emerging black proletariat.\\" = Migration narrative = Attaway's novel is also a migration narrative, as it traces the journey of African American brothers from Southern farm life to the industrial North. Lawrence R. Rodgers states that there are four kinds of migration narratives, the Early Migration Novel, the Harlem Renaissance, the Fugitive Migration Novel, and finally the Communal Migrant Novel, which is post-Depression. Blood on the Forge would be considered an Early Migration Novel, as it takes place during the early 20th century and because of its industrial subject matter. Rodgers explains that Harlem Renaissance works do not discuss the actual migration, only what came of it, and in her review of Rodgers' Canaan Bound: The African-American Great Migration Novel, Farrah Jasmine Griffin states, \\"If the Harlem Renaissance writers failed to make the most of the migration novel form, the generation that followed‚Äîfueled by the depression economy, personal deprivation, and a strong sense of displacement‚Äîput migration at the center, not the periphery, of its artistic imagination.\\" In particular, Chicago writers such as Attaway were responding to the failures of Harlem Renaissance writers to express the first wave of African American migration. One important aspect of the migration narrative is its emphasis on the differences between the traditional (or folk) and the modern. Migration narratives typically include references to ancestors and strangers, with ancestors being linked to the South and strangers to the North. In Blood on the Forge, the immigrants the Moss brothers work with in the mills would be considered strangers.Griffin, Farah Jasmine (1995). \\"Who set you flowin'?\\": the African-American migration narrative, p. 3. Oxford University Press. . Ancestors are also linked with folklore and tradition, such as music and food. Melody tries to keep the brother's heritage alive with his guitar. Each brother experiences his own shift from the folk to the industrial that is characteristic of the Great Migration. Melody changes the way he plays the guitar from slicking the chords, as he did at home, to picking them. Chinatown loses his eyes in an accidental explosion in the mills, forcing him to adapt to the industrial world as a blind man. Big Mat is the last one to leave behind his tradition. While at home he lashed out in anger against his oppressors, such as the riding boss, in the North Big Mat joins the oppressor as he becomes a deputy, using his anger to break his fellow workers' strike. Edward E. Waldron describes him as becoming \\"as destructive as the exploding furnace\\". Style = Form of the migration narrative = In her book, Who Set You Flowin'?: The African American Migration Narrative, Farah Jasmine Griffin explains that the migration narrative is a dominant form in African American culture. Griffin cites Lawrence Rodgers as the first to identify migration with the emergence of a new genre: the Great Migration Novel. This type of work that Blood on the Forge is associated with has a specific narrative form. In relation to the dominant white society, all migrants are strangers: foreigners driven by persecution to wander in search of a new home. In Attaway's novel, the mill workers all fall under this category. The Moss brothers work with foreign immigrants as well as other Southern migrants like themselves. Within the context of the African American community, the stranger is that figure who possesses no connections to the community. As they migrate to the industrial North, the Moss brothers leave their home and traditions, and start over in a place where they have no connections. Griffin describes four moments that occur in migration narratives. Not all migration narratives have all four, and they need not occur in this order. 1) An event that propels action north. In Blood on the Forge, this event is the opportunity for new jobs and a better life. 2) Presentation of the initial confrontation within the urban landscape. The first confrontation the Moss brothers have is when they get off the train and arrive in the city for their new job. As they do this, they meet immigrants and are confronted with the diversity and entirely different atmosphere of the urban landscape. 3) Illustration of attempt to negotiate. The bulk of the novel is the brothers trying to adapt to their new lifestyle. 4) Vision of possibilities or limitations of the North. We see both limitations and possibilities of the North in this novel. At the end as Melody and Chinatown leave for a new opportunity in a new city, there is a sense of possibility for a better situation than the previous one. Limitations of the North can be seen in several instances throughout the story. Chinatown loses his eyes in a fatal explosion in the mills, and Big Mat loses his life trying to gain respect. Characters = Major characters =  Big Mat  Big Mat is the eldest of the three Moss brothers. In Part One of Attaway's novel he is employed as a sharecropper on Mr. Johnston's farm in Kentucky. Of the three brothers Big Mat's most notable attributes are his physical size/strength, his rage, and his constant need to be a provider for his family. After the brothers migrate to Pennsylvania Big Mat focuses his energies on doing well at his new job, and scrupulously saves his money so that he might bring his wife Hattie North. Eventually his resolve breaks and Big Mat enters into a relationship with the prostitute Anna. Mat continues to use his physical strength as a weapon against others until his death during the raid of the Union Headquarters. According to Phillip H. Vaughan's article \\"From Pastoralism to Industrial Antipathy in William Attaway's Blood on the Forge\\" Attaway uses Big Mat's character to represents \\"the plodding strength and endurance of all Southern Negroes under their particular color-caste system\\". Edward E. Waldron claims that Big Mat represents \\"the last side of the complete folk culture, religion, and an equally important tie to the soil. \\" John Claborn asserts that while Melody and Chinatown become destroyed in the North, Big Mat \\"thrives\\" in his new home, as he, \\"identifies more with the machines than with his fellow white workers, for they allow him to flourish in a way denied him by Jim Crow. (Subscription needed for online access.) \\"  Chinatown Moss  Chinatown is a younger half sibling to Big Mat. Chinatown resists sharecropping work, instead enjoying a lazy and carefree lifestyle on the Kentucky farm. Chinatown focuses on his own needs before those of the family, using his money on frivolous items such as a gold tooth. After leaving the farm, Chinatown, succumbing to the temptations offered by city life in Pennsylvania, becomes fascinated with drinking, gambling, and hiring prostitutes. Midway through the novel, Chinatown is left blind after an accident at the steel mill and is forced out of work and into the care of Big Mat and Melody. Phillip H. Vaughan argues that Chinatown's \\"lazy, happy-go- lucky attitude reflects in part a psychological response to the subjugated position of the Negroes\\" following the abolition of slavery. Edward E. Waldron claims that Chinatown's main concern in life is to make himself unique, to be noticed as special; his gold tooth provides relief for this concern, and \\"looking at the tooth shining back at him from his mirror image gives Chinatown a real sense of being somebody. \\" Stacy I. Morgan claims that the tooth represents Chinatown's \\"fragile sense of self-esteem,\\" and that he \\"fixes on the gold tooth as a way of struggling to affirm his individuality and humanity in the face of a socioeconomic system that would otherwise reduce him to a faceless sharecropper.  Melody Moss  Melody, like Chinatown, is a younger half-sibling to Big Mat. Melody's most prominent characteristic is his love for music, which is expressed through his guitar playing. Once the brothers migrate to Pennsylvania, Melody is forced to work in the steel mills alongside his brothers; this harsh new way of life alienates Melody from his guitar, and he ceases to play. Melody develops feelings for Anna, despite her relationship with Big Mat, and tries to convince her to run away with him. According to Vaughan, Melody's blues singing \\"recreates and sustains the pastoral myth... and an existence characterized by images of hunger, barrenness, and drudgery\\". = Minor characters =  Hattie  Hattie is Big Mat's wife. When the Moss Brothers travel North, Hattie is left behind pregnant. Big Mat receives a letter from Hattie saying that she fell and lost the baby.  Sugar Mama  Sugar Mama is a prostitute from \\"Mex Town.\\"  Anna  Anna is fourteen or fifteen years old and Sugar Mama's niece. Sugar Mama sent for Anna from New Mexico, thinking she would bring more business. At first, Anna tries to sleep with Melody, but when Big Mat defends Anna after an owner at the dog fight hits her, she becomes infatuated with Big Mat. Anna moves into a shack with Big Mat, where she endures his beatings.  Smothers  Smothers is a crippled laborer. In an article published in MFS Modern Fiction Studies, John Claborn claims that Smothers is \\"a prophetic spokesman for the earth's pain.\\" Claborn notes that Smother's legs have been mutilated in a violent steel mill incident, and claims that \\"Smothers's shrill prophecies are the product of wisdom gained through suffering, of a heightened sense of what the ground feels as it is mined, smelted, and made into steel. \\" After Smothers dies in a mill accident, his co-workers memorialize him by turning the steel scraps from the accident into watch fobs, wearing these around their necks for luck.  Mr. Johnston  The Moss brothers sharecrop on Mr. Johnson's land in Kentucky. Mr. Johnston had stopped giving the family food credit after Big Mat killed the mule Mr. Johnston had lent them, and claims the Moss family's share of the crop for the next two years to pay for the loss of the animal. However, Mr. Johnston wants to prevent the brothers from leaving to work in the North, so he tells Big Mat that he will give the Moss' a mule so that they can continue to work their land, and offers Melody and Chinatown work doing odd jobs around his farm.  Riding Boss  Big Mat identifies the Kentucky riding boss as the son of a poor white sharecropper. When Big Mat goes to get the mule he was promised by Mr. Johnston, the riding boss, eager to exert his power, insults and whips Big Mat. Big Mat loses his temper and attacks the riding boss, prompting the brothers' departure to the north.  Bo  Bo is the \\"boss of stove gang\\" who catches Chinatown and Melody staring at the woman with the \\"rotted\\" breast. Bo points Chinatown and Melody in the right direction of the bunkhouse.  Mike  Mike is an Italian open-hearth worker who helps the brothers learn the ropes around the mill.  O'Casey  O'Casey is the diminutive pit boss in charge of the brothers' group at the mill.  Zanski  Zanski is an old, Slavic laborer who works with the brothers in the pit and works at the lunch car with his granddaughter, Rosie. He's eventually fired from the mills.  Rosie  Rosie is Zanski's granddaughter who waitresses at the lunch car. Later in the novel it is revealed that she also works as a prostitute. Themes =Nature= There is something very timely in Attaway's implicit warning against the industry of the North, as Edward Margolies suggests in his introduction to the 1969 edition of the novel: possibly he [Attaway] saw his worst fears realized in the rapid spread industrial wastelands and the consequent plight of urban Negroes. From one point of view Attaway's feelings about the sanctity of nature now seem almost quaint in an age of cybernetics. The Moss brothers idealize nature, looking back on their homeland of Kentucky with a certain pastoral fondness. Although the nature of the South is idealized, in both the North and the South nature is dying. In the South, Attaway highlights the overworked land, Big Mat's barren wife Hattie, the family‚Äôs extreme hunger, and the drudgery of plowing all day with no reward. Likewise, the urban landscape of the North is also painted as dismal and dying. In the North, Attaway shows the defilement of natural landscape, evident \\"in the pollution of the 'dirty-as-a-catfish-hole river with a beautiful name: the Monongahela,\\" as well as the \\"'mountains of red ore, yellow limestone, and black coke,' that line the river banks.\\" Attaway's use of \\"mules\\" in both the South and North, in different contexts, highlights the Moss brothers' \\"unfamiliarity of the artifacts of industrial technology\\" as well as the similarities between the two places.\\" \\"Mule\\" refers both to the animal in the South, and the \\"small engines that hauled steel along the river front\\" in the Northern mills.\\" The mules, though in the South a part of nature and the pastoral nostalgia felt by the Moss brothers, essentially serve the same function as the mules of the mills; both types of mules perform a mechanized, repetitive task. Stacy I. Morgan argues that Attaway calls attention to the mechanical mules not only to contrast with the animals of sharecropping, but to call attention to the mule's prominence within African American history and folklore. Morgan also claims that Attaway \\"indirectly evokes America's unfulfilled promises of enfranchisement ('forty acres and a mule') as well as the long-standing identification of African American men with the mule as a creature that stubbornly endures despite being much abused as a beast of burden.\\" Attaway exposes the danger of destroying nature through the voice of the mill worker Smothers, who repeatedly warns his fellow workers of the destructive power of the machines. Though the workers seem to see Smothers' prophecies as merely \\"half-mad, shrill rants,\\" Claborn argues that \\"Attaway goes out of his way to invest [Smothers] with a strange dignity and characterize him as a Tiresian speaker of truth. \\" Smothers sees that destruction of nature \\"can lead to can lead to industrial accidents, understood as the land avenging itself against humans. \\" =Hunger= Attaway depicts how African American sharecroppers were forcibly deprived of many of life's necessities. In Kentucky, the Moss brothers had to use newspapers attached to the wall in order to provide a bit of insulation, and they are so hungry that they chose to smoke or chew tobacco in an attempt to suppress their appetites. One way that they deal with this hunger is through music, and the novel opens with Melody playing the \\"hungry blues\\" on his guitar, which he hopes will distract his family members from their empty stomachs. Metaphorically, the Moss brothers are also \\"hungry\\" for other possessions, those that would not satisfy their physical hunger but rather that part of themselves that desired for a comfortable, leisurely life. This hunger is expressed by the brothers through their \\"wishing game,\\" where Melody and Chinatown fantasize about their ideal day. When the game is played in the South this idyllic day takes place in the city, where the brothers imagine that they are dressed in fine clothes, gamble all day, and eat and drink their favorite things. Once they migrate to the Northern city, this fantasy day takes place back home in the country. They experience this emotional, existential hunger in both locations. Stacy I. Morgan argues that they desire things that remain \\"ever out of reach,\\" which shows that \\"the existential dimension of Attaway's hunger metaphor arises precisely out of this perpetually deferred set of desires.\\"  North vs South  In an article published by Negro American Literature Forum, Edward E. Waldron claims that Attaway depicts an intricate examination of the \\"death of the blues\\", or the death of folk culture, with the Moss brothers' move from the South to the North. The changes in Melody and Chinatown reflect the overall changes that southern blacks experienced in the Great Migration, as they have to leave their folk ways behind in order to survive their new, \\"industrially-oriented environment.\\" Stacy I. Morgan also alludes to the ways in which the brothers' mind-set has shifted upon migrating to the North. Their vastly increased income in the North allows them new opportunities and multiple ways to spend their new capital, emphasizing instant gratification \\" Morgan also notes that the Moss brothers' fear in the train scene, during which their inability to see each other fills each brother with a terrifying sense of isolation, may be Attway's way of highlighting an issue that confronted many who moved during the Great Migration: the \\"absence of material links to the family, community, and lifeways of former homes, which w[as] frequently demanded by the circumstances of the migration journey northward‚Äîa journey that, for many African Americans, did necessarily commence under cover of night. \\" Morgan asserts that with the absence of these links to their former selves, it was especially difficult for the migrants to retain any former cultural identity in their new homes.  Mechanization  Edward E. Waldron claims that Blood on the Forge is a story of \\"man's changing nature in the face of ever- increasing mechanization.\\" Stacy I. Morgan states that the physical injuries experienced in the mills are extreme examples of the larger process going on: the \\"transforming [of] workers' sense of time and of their own bodies.\\" Phyllis R. Klotman looks at the ways in which the three brothers bodies became tools, a part of machine: \\"Chinatown is blinded in an accident which eats up the lives of fourteen men; Melody‚Äôs hand is smashed so that he is no longer able to play the guitar; Big Mat is killed during the strike which he has become as unwitting tool the bosses wield against the white workers,\\" suggesting that \\"the three brothers are systematically unmanned by the dehumanizing process of forging steel.\\" One of the tragic outcomes in the novel, according to Klotman, is the loss of continuity in the lives of men who are almost human sacrifices to the industrial Moloch created by an unseen hand grasping for profits. By wearing scraps of the steel that killed Smothers, John Claborn argues that the workers \\"give the steel a ritual value that escapes the logic of exchange value; these scraps open up a space for resistance, insofar as they signify the workers' communal bonding.\\" With this act, Attaway may signify a \\"shift in the workers' consciousness,\\" as \\"the narration itself seems to gain a heightened awareness of the connection between steel and the ground.\\" In addition, Claborn feels that \\"Smothers is ritually sacrificed for the sake of more direct commentary on steel production as a globally interdependent process.\\" As Attaway wrote, \\"The nearness of a farmer to his farm was easily understood. But no man was close to steel. It was shipped across endless tracks to all the world.\\" Claborn claims that Big Mat embodies the link between mechanic and racial violence. Once he is deputized, given power by the white law enforcement, and charged to \\"suppress the white workers,\\" he \\"relishes the terror he inspires.\\" Claborn notes that, \\"once the strike begins and the furnaces start to cool down because there are not enough workers to keep them burning, Big Mat single-handedly tries to keep the machines functioning,\\" and claims that this \\"impossible effort\\" shows that \\"Big Mat has himself become a machine.\\" \\"Only as he dies [‚Ä¶] does Big Mat glimpse the reality that, in siding with the mill owners and in becoming a machine, he has become an agent of oppression.\\"  Myth of the American Dream and the working class  Attaway's novel depicts how industrial technology dehumanizes working class laborers, alienates workers from the products of their labors, and also highlights how capitalism moved towards mechanized standardization and away from individualized artistry and craftsmanship. The character Anna in particular illustrates another aspect of the American myth, according to Stacy I. Morgan, as Anna dreams of becoming \\"like the Americanos.\\" However, Morgan writes, Anna attempts to move up in class by wearing shiny heels and an elaborate gown, and thereby \\"misapprehends the complexity of American class identity by reducing it to material cultural signs.\\" Eventually, her dress becomes filthy from being dragged in the mud, and Anna must wear it \\"pinned like a diaper between her legs,\\" which Morgan claims illustrates how that \\"the icon intended as a symbol of maturity and class status\\" becomes a symbol of \\"Anna's childishness.\\" In addition, Morgan notes that Anna is \\"tragically pathetic,\\" forbidden by Big Mat to go out in public, the space \\"for which such ostentatious apparel is designed.\\" Critical reception Attaway's novels were not a major attraction to critics at their time of publication. Although Attaway's novels were received well, they have not been as critically acclaimed as other novels written during the 1940s, including The Grapes of Wrath (Steinbeck, 1939) and Native Son (Wright, 1941) which have both maintained an exceptional reputation for radical novels written during the Great Depression. Attaway did not continue writing novels after Blood on the Forge, but instead went on to successfully write and produce songs, music and screenplays.

It falls without producing fruit or seeds, due to its inability to fructify. Flowers require both male and female organs to reproduce, and the pistils and ovary serve as female organs, while the stamens are considered male organs. Illustrative examples include Urginea nagarjunae and Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae.  Causes of Flower Abortion  Pollinated flowers and fruits can abort selectively. It could be because of the order of pollination, the number of developing seeds, pollen source, or some combination of these. Flowers and fruits can also abort because of outside causes like insufficient light, unsuitable photo-period, high temperature, nutrient deficiency, ethylene, drought stress. There is research to suggest that random selective abortions based on the timing of fertilization could increase the genetic quality of seeds. The age of the flower also has an effect on the percentage of abortion. The older the flower, the more likely it is to be aborting the fruit or pollen.

Service history Siegfried was formed in October 1943 to operate against the North Atlantic convoy routes and comprised 18 boats. It consisted of seven boats from the disbanded group Schlieffen, plus eleven others from bases in France and Germany. All the reinforcements were commanded by new skippers; six from Norway were also new boats, while the five from France were experienced boats with new commanders. The Siegfried boats had fuel problems, so a re-fueling group was established north of the Azores, of three tankers and a flak boat as escort. Siegfried was deployed to intercept east-bound convoys in mid-Atlantic, planning to attack while travelling towards the re-fueling group and home bases in France. However the Allies became aware of Siegfrieds position, and diverted their east-bound HX and SC convoys out of harm's way, leaving a massively re-inforced west-bound convoy, ON 207 to run into Siegfried as bait. Three Siegfried boats were destroyed in engagements with ON 207's escorts (, , and ), while the re- fueling group was attacked by USN hunter-killer groups centred on the escort carriers and . Two Siegfried boats ( and ) and one tanker () were destroyed and the flak boat () was damaged and forced to return to base.

It was a national bestseller in the 1940s and adapted into a film, The Valley of Decision, in 1945. During the late 1930s Davenport, best known for her biography of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, spent several years in Pittsburgh, her imagination caught by the drama of American industry. In 1942, Charles Scribner's Sons published her Pittsburgh novel, The Valley of Decision. It was an instant success, and its story of four generations of the Scott family‚Äîowners and operators of a Pittsburgh iron and steel works. Overview The story chronicles the family fortunes from the economic panic of 1873 through the dramatic rise of American industry and trade unionism, though waves of immigration, class conflict, natural disaster, World War I, to Pearl Harbor. The first portion of the narrative covers the period 1873-83, when ironmaster William Campbell Scott, son of the deceased senior William Scott who had founded of the Scott Iron Works in 1836, led the company through the 1873 depression and American industrial progress, only to die at the hands of union agitators. The second section covers 1889-1929 and his son Paul, who inherits the mills and manages them well, embracing technology, the demands of the Spanish-American and first World Wars, and an enlightened view of labor. Part Three (1933‚Äì41) is the book of Claire, great-granddaughter of William. Energetic, responsible, and worldly-wise, she fights to save the integrity of the family‚Äôs mills as they pass into the hands of corporation lawyers and bored Scott cousins. It is also Claire who expands the story to Eastern Europe, where, as an international journalist, she brings the horrifying events leading to World War II to the attention of an impassive America. But the central character in the Scott family saga is Mary Rafferty, an Irish maid who, as the novel opens, enters the Scott household at the age of sixteen. Her sixty-eight years of service to the Scotts span the growth of the family‚Äôs mills and the vicissitudes of individual family members. Mary is an advisor and trusted equal of the younger generations of Scotts, particularly Paul, for whom she is a driving force and lifelong love. Mary sees beyond her station, perceptive in ways the wealthy Scotts are not. Her unswerving loyalty to them, and her fierce independence from them, make her the core and the conscience of the family and of the book.

The parish church has a fine set of church bellsEnthusiasts web-site  Demographic  = Population = Since the 1800s there has been regular data collected regarding the parishes's population. The total population has fluctuated over the years but has actually decreased by 23% over the last 200 years. However, the population has not always decreased. Records show that between 1801 and 1841 the population increased by 46%. In addition to this, in 1911 there was a sudden increase of 9%. Chetton's population does not follow suit of the English population; between 1801 and 1961 the total population of England had steadily increased by 460%. It is not unusual for small civil parishes such as Chetton to have dwindling populations. Many young people living in such areas find it hard to gain employment and social events for the younger generations are limited resulting in many migrating in search of better opportunities in the city. As the population of England and Wales has increased, so has the population density. Between 1800 and 1960 the population density of England and Wales has increased dramatically. In contrast to this Chetton's population density has not fluctuated at all, if anything it has very slightly decreased. The most recent Census data available for Chetton is the 2011 census and according to this census the parish had a total of 349 people. At the previous census 2001 this had decreased since 1911 to 304 and the first census data in 1801 where the population was 396. This had been total decrease of 23% since 1801, which for such a small parish is a considerable amount of decrease compared to other towns and villages in Shropshire; however in the ten years to 2011 the population has started to increase again. At the time of the 2011 census, the total headcount for Chetton was 349, 185 of these were males and 164 were females, with a total of 133 households. = Population Density (Per Acre) = Since the data from the 1881 census was published the population density of Chetton has steadily increased ever since. Compared to the population density of England and Wales which has stayed the same and slightly decreased around the 1900 but then increased soon after. The density changes a lot from one census to another but that was also down the change of map boundaries. = Occupation Structure = Even when the first census was produced it categorised into three categories, 'chiefly employed in agriculture', those 'chiefly employed in trade, manufacturers or handicraft', and 'others'. However, as time went on the censuses became more detailed, data was collected on people's occupations and were then used in the 1841 census whereby there was over 3,000 different occupational titles. This was not practical but at the time there was no advice on how to organise the job titles as they did not expect the vast number of job titles that were given. The 1881 census shows that Chetton was an agricultural parish but it was mainly males working in this sector as it also shows that the majority of the women were unemployed. Some women were employed but it was not in a manual profession, they were employed in a domestic service role or in an office.  Housing  Census data has enabled us to have an insight to the way Chetton used to be. In 1831 the census began to gather more personal information about people's properties, the number of rooms, the number of people living there etc., but the statistical data gathered was the number of people occupying the house and the number of rooms. We are able to use this data and see that there were 123 houses of which 199 of these were occupied. Every census since has asked similar questions. The number of houses in Chetton has fluctuated over the last 200 years but in 1961 the total number of houses had decreased to 180, however, all of these were occupied. Between 1921 and 1961 the number of rooms in Chetton had increased by 3 despite the decrease in houses The types of houses in Chetton are a mixture of terraced houses, farm houses and detached houses. Many of these houses used to be owned by farmers who used to make their living out of agriculture, whether it would be growing and selling crops such as wheat, oats and grain or farming cattle, sheep or chickens. Chetton was very much an agricultural parish.  Transport  = Car = Chetton is accessible by various country lanes but all these roads connect to the B4364 and the B4368. These join the A458 which joins Chetton to the nearest town, Bridgnorth. = Train = There are two main railway stations near Chetton, however, there are no stations in the parish itself. The nearest station is Shifnal railway station around 12 miles away and Telford Central railway station, also 12 miles away.

The lodge was built in the Lincoln Hills Country Club, which was at the time the only African-American resort in the western United States. The Lincoln Hills club was organized in 1922, selling lots with payments as low as $5.00 down and $5.00 per month. The lodge was built by Obrey Wendell \\"Winks\\" Hamlet in 1928. Hamlet had been involved in the original club project, and had been assembling land for a lodge since 1925. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 caused many lots in Lincoln Hills to be abandoned, but Hamlet promoted the lodge nationally through advertisements in Ebony and attracted a clientele from the eastern United States. The hillside lodge used local stone for the foundation, with a three-story shingled superstructure. The first floor was for service and storage, the second for dining and entertainment, and the third included six guest rooms and a shared bath. Several cabins surrounded the main lodge, including a honeymoon cabin and a tavern. Prominent guests included Count Basie, Billy Eckstein, Duke Ellington, Lena Horne, Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. The lodge operated until Winks' death in 1965. It is now owned by the James Beckwourth Mountain Club, which has undertaken restoration of the lodge as a conference center.

Overview  Alexander's typically holds three to four auctions per year, and concentrates on the following categories: Militaria of all types, Colonial and Revolutionary War; the American Civil War; Americana; Presidents and Vice Presidents; Supreme Court, Cabinet Members & Politicians; Royalty and Heads of State; Military Leaders; Scientists and Inventors; Aviators, Explorers, Astronauts; Business Leaders; Authors and Writers; Artists, Illustrators and Animation Art; Composers and Musicians; Entertainers; Rock and Roll; Notables and the Notorious; and Sports. Alexander Autographs is smaller than the three major auction houses. However, the company seems to have carved out a definite niche in the market over the past 25 years, becoming famous for its high-dollar controversial sales.  Notable and controversial sales  = October 2005 = Alexander Autographs auctioned off a gold Rolex wristwatch inscribed with a message from Marilyn Monroe to President John F. Kennedy. The message reads: JACK, With love as always, from MARILYN May 29, 1962, only ten days after her famous \\"Happy Birthday\\" performance at Madison Square Garden. Included in the watch case is a poem from Monroe to Kennedy ending with a passionate plea: \\"Let me love or let me die!\\" The watch and accompanying items sold for $120,000 to an anonymous East Coast collector. = February 2006 = Alexander Autographs was forced to withdraw a letter it was auctioning, purporting to be from Ronald Reagan and written during the President's later years while he suffered with Alzheimer's. The letter's content‚Äîhand-written annotations and references to the disease, was reported upon by CBS News, U.S. News & World Report, and other media. Bill Panagopulos, company president, withdrew the item when it was discovered to have been forged and advised the press that he had been \\"duped\\" by a forger. = August 2008 = Alexander Autographs found itself embroiled in a row with eBay, the online auction house, when eBay refused to run Alexander's Nazi and other German World War II items on its website. Alexander's complied, but issued a statement on its own website adding that, \\"Though these items are indeed controversial, we maintain that they are of vital historic importance and cannot and must not be ignored.\\" = November 2008 = Alexander Autographs received news coverage when the company announced plans to auction two particular items in the November 6‚Äì7 auction: the flight suit of Paul Tibbets and secret audio tapes from Jack Ruby's legal defense team. Tibbets, a colonel during World War II, flew the Hiroshima bombing mission‚Äîthe auction house offered the very suit he wore on that mission and the Distinguished Service Cross Tibbets earned for his actions.

Founded in 1912, the club's home is the City Club Building, formerly the Citizens Building, on Euclid Avenue in Downtown Cleveland. Known as \\"America's Citadel of Free Speech,\\" it is one of the oldest continuous independent free speech forums in the United States. The mission of the City Club is to \\"create conversations of consequence that help democracy thrive.\\" Membership is open to anyone and all programs are open to the general public, although members are charged lower prices to attend most forums and given preference in making reservations to certain programs. History President Barack Obama addresses the City Club, honoring a longstanding tradition of sitting U.S. Presidents started by Ronald Reagan. The City Club was conceived at a luncheon in June 1912 organized by Mayo Fesler, secretary of the Cleveland Municipal Association, in the ideals of the Progressive Era. Future Cleveland City Manager Daniel E. Morgan was its first president. Since its founding, it has hosted sitting U.S. Presidents and Vice-Presidents and other notable citizens of the United States and the world. Archbishop Desmond Tutu called the club \\"a beacon, a symbol and a sentinel for freedom, for justice, for tolerance\\" when he spoke there.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnP21_PInLI The first President to have appeared at the City Club was Theodore Roosevelt; every President since Jimmy Carter has appeared at its podium.Cho, Janet, Plain Dealer, July 22, 2005 President George W. Bush spoke to the club on the third anniversary of the United States' invasion of Iraq. Because the City Club of Cleveland does not allow questions from the audience to be pre-screened, President Ronald Reagan declined to appear before the Club, but when questions were raised by the media about his mental acuity, Reagan sought out an appearance before the Club to refute those charges. The day after Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy gave his On the Mindless Menace of Violence speech at the club.Audio of the speech from the City Club In 1976, as part of the United States Bicentennial, the club held a forum in Britain, the club's first outside the United States.Segal, Grant, Plain Dealer, July 30, 2011, \\"Bob Cavano, led City Club, several other civic groups\\" Debates before the Club have swayed Ohio elections. Before John Glenn defeated Howard Metzenbaum in the 1974 Democratic Senate primary, Glenn responded to a charge in an earlier debate that he never had to make a payroll: During the 2010 Congressional elections, in which the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives, John Boehner on August 24, 2010, announced a five- point plan at the club that he said would provide an effective economic alternative to the Democrats' course.

Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who complained vociferously about being excluded from debates among the Democratic candidates for President, has several times refused to debate his opponent for Congress in The City Club of Cleveland debates.

It now serves as an entertainment and financial channel. *Hanoi Cable Network Television (Hanoicab), an cable network. History In October 14, 1954, the Hanoi Radio commenced broadcasting for the first time. On January 6, 1978, Hanoi People's Committee decided the 41/QDTC to Hanoi Radio open the Television service. The television service launched on 1 January 1979 at 2PM (GMT+7). Originally, it is the 45 minutes programmes block on VTV1 (channel 6 VHF). It later became sole television channel, broadcast on channel 6, VHF, replaced VTV3 (at that time VTV3 was aired on channel 6 VHF, later it moved to channel 22 UHF). Throughout the times, the Hanoian television channel increases the broadcasting times. Since August 1, 2008, following the merger of Ha Tay Province into Hanoi region and the dissolved of Ha Tay radio & television station, Hanoi Television expanded into two television channels. The radio frequency of Ha Tay radio station was also merged with Hanoi Radio & Television. In 2013, Hanoi Television launched the third channel, Hanoi TV3, on channel 49 UHF, broadcasting only in Hanoi. However, this channel only relay programs from Hanoi TV1. The exact time to stop broadcasting Hanoi TV3 is unknown. From 2010 to 2016, Hanoi Television broadcast live all matches of English Premier League, alongside with several Vietnamese subscription networks. Also from 2016, Hanoi TV1 expanded the broadcast times to 24 hours per day, following by Hanoi TV2 on the year after. Since January 1, 2019, following the contractual partnership with The Voice of Ho Chi Minh City (VOH), Hanoi Radio begun to air selected programmes from VOH stations which currently broadcasting on the original frequencies of 99.9 MHz and 96.5 MHz.

The graphical form is an alternate compact representation of a game using the interaction among participants. Consider a game with n players with m strategies each. We will represent the players as nodes in a graph in which each player has a utility function that depends only on him and his neighbors. As the utility function depends on fewer other players, the graphical representation would be smaller. Formal definition A graphical game is represented by a graph G, in which each player is represented by a node, and there is an edge between two nodes i and j iff their utility functions are depended on the strategy which the other player will choose. Each node i in G has a function u_{i}:{1\\\\ldots m}^{d_{i}+1}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R}, where d_i is the degree of vertex i. u_{i} specifies the utility of player i as a function of his strategy as well as those of his neighbors. The size of the game's representation For a general n players game, in which each player has m possible strategies, the size of a normal form representation would be O(m^{n}). The size of the graphical representation for this game is O(m^{d}) where d is the maximal node degree in the graph. If d\\\\ll n, then the graphical game representation is much smaller. An example In case where each player's utility function depends only on one other player: Image:GraphicalGameExample.pngThe graphical form of the described game The maximal degree of the graph is 1, and the game can be described as n functions (tables) of size m^{2}. So, the total size of the input will be nm^{2}. Nash equilibrium Finding Nash equilibrium in a game takes exponential time in the size of the representation. If the graphical representation of the game is a tree, we can find the equilibrium in polynomial time. In the general case, where the maximal degree of a node is 3 or more, the problem is NP-complete.  Further reading  * Michael Kearns (2007) \\"Graphical Games\\". In * Michael Kearns, Michael L.

Most of the immigration is for economic reasons. The linguistic similarities between Romanian and Spanish, as well as Romanians' Latin identity, are also a reason for the country's attractiveness. Background After the December, 1989 Romanian Revolution, emigration was liberalized, but for the next few years, emigration to Spain was modest. It started to increase slowly during the late 1990s, and exploded after 2002. Emigration was further facilitated by the entry of Romania in the EU in 2007. By 2011, it reached a peak of nearly 900,000 people, after which the Romanian population has been steadily decreasing as a result of emigration from Spain since 2012 due to the economic problems and unemployment in the country, falling to 669,434 by 2019. Because of this, the diaspora in Italy, which has continued to increase, is now considerably larger than that in Spain. Population Romanian diaspora in Spain is today the second Romanian diaspora in the EU, after that of Italy. In recent years, emigration to Southern Europe has started to slow down, with many Romanians now preferring Scandinavian counties such as Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, as well as the UK, Germany, and Ireland.

Born in Bradford, Yorkshire, Gill joined Manchester United as an apprentice in June 1984, and turned professional on his 18th birthday in March 1986. His first team debut for the club came 10 months later, when he stood in for Bryan Robson in a 1‚Äì1 draw away to Southampton on 3 January 1987. However, he was then diagnosed with problems with his Achilles tendon and it took two operations before he could return to first team action nearly two years later. In fact, he did not play at all between January and August 1988. Upon his return to the first team, Gill became an established member of the squad, playing in various roles in both defence and midfield. He scored twice for United at senior level; the first in the FA Cup third round replay against QPR at Loftus Road on 11 January 1989 ‚Äì 10 days after a fine performance in the 3‚Äì1 home league win over rivals Liverpool. His next goal came three days after, on 14 January, in a 3‚Äì0 home win over Millwall in the league. On 27 March 1989, Gill came off worse in an accidental collision with Nottingham Forest defender Brian Laws in a 2-0 league defeat at the City Ground, suffering a broken leg and a shattered ankle. Gill never played professional football again, announcing his retirement on medical advice the following year. Not to be discouraged, upon his recovery, Gill went into coaching and took a job as youth coach at Bristol Rovers. He joined Bath City in March 1997 as assistant to manager Steve Millard, also making two first team appearances to briefly revive his playing career after eight years out of action. He was released by Bath in September 1997 for financial reasons and later retired from football altogether.

It was created in 1721,Dawa Norbu, China's Tibet Policy and set by Qianlong Emperor in 1751 for the Ganden Phodrang in the 13-Article Ordinance for the More Effective Governing of Tibet„ÄäÈÖåÂÆöË•øËóèÂñÑÂêéÁ´†Á®ãÂçÅ‰∏âÊù°„Äã. In that year the Tibetan government was reorganized after the riots in Lhasa of the previous year. The civil administration was represented by Council (Kashag) after the post of Desi (or Regent; see: dual system of government) was abolished by the Qing imperial court. The Qing imperial court wanted the 7th Dalai Lama to hold both religious and administrative rule, while strengthening the position of the High Commissioners.Seventh Dalai Lama Kelsang Gyatso The Dalai Lamas of Tibet, p. 101.

Shakabpa, Tibet, a Political History (New Haven: Yale, 1967), 150. 1938 British Mount Everest Expeditionalt= As specified by the 13-Article Ordinance for the More Effective Governing of Tibet, Kashag was composed of three temporal officials and one monk official. Each of them held the title of Kal√∂n (; ), sought appointment from the Qing imperial court, and the Qing imperial court issued certificates of appointment. The function of the council was to decide government affairs collectively, and present opinions to the office of the first minister. The first minister then presented these opinions to the Dalai Lama and, during the Qing Dynasty the Amban, for a final decision. The privilege of presenting recommendations for appointing executive officials, governors and district commissioners gave the Council much power. On 28 March 1959, Zhou Enlai, the premier of the People's Republic of China (PRC), formally announced the dissolution of the Kashag.https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/jcws.2006.8.3.pdf  Ministries  Organizational chart of Ganden Phodrang Headed by the council was the government administration, divided into ministries: political, military, economic, judicial, foreign, financial and educational departments. Except for the Ministry of Finance (; ), all ministries had two representatives ‚Äì one temporal and one monastic. The Ministry of Finance had three lay officials. Each of them held the title of Tsip√∂n (; ). All ministries had a right to make decisions to the extent of their competence. Matters, or problems outside the competence of ministries were (with a particular ministry's given opinion) presented to the council. Everything outside the competence of the council was presented to the Dalai Lama himself.  Central Tibetan Administration  The Kashag has been maintained to the present time by the Central Tibetan Administration, the government-in-exile maintained in Dharamsala, India. The head of the Kashag was known as Kal√∂n Tripa until September, 2012, when the title was changed to Sikyong. This position, sometimes referred to informally as the prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile, became an elected position in 2001. In 2011, shortly after the election of Lobsang Sangay and upon the resignation of the Dalai Lama as the overall leader of the CTA, the head of the Kashag became the highest political official in the Tibetan exile community. According to Michael Backman, notable past members of the Cabinet include Gyalo Thondup, the Dalai Lama's eldest brother, who served as Chairman of the Cabinet and as Minister of Security, and Jetsun Pema, the Dalai Lama's younger sister, who served variously as Minister of Health and of Education. * Lobsang Sangay - Prime Minister, Sikyong and Minister for Education * Dolma Gyari - Minister for Home * Dicki Chhoyang - Minister for Information & International Relations * Pema Chinnjor - Minister for Religion & Culture * Ngodup Drongchung - Minister for Security * Tsering Dhondup - Minister for Finance * Tsering Wangchuk - Minister for Health  References   See also  * Ganden Phodrang * Chinese expedition to Tibet (1720) * Tibet under Qing rule * Dual system of government Category:Politics of Tibet Category:History of Tibet Category:1721 in Tibet ","title":"Kashag"},{"id":"20014645","text":"Allenna Leonard is an American cyberneticist, consultant and Director of Team Syntegrity Inc. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, internationally, specializing in the application of Stafford Beer's Viable System Model and Syntegration.ABOUT THE ASC OFFICERS.

Formal relations between the two countries first began in 2000, when Malaysia became the first Asian country to establish a liaison office in Kosovo. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 and Malaysia recognised it on 30 October 2008.  Pre-independence relations  Since 1999, immediately after Kosovo became an international protectorate, Malaysia agreed to send peacekeepers as part of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. Later that year, in September, Malaysia began to make plans for \\"a centre to coordinate medical relief aid and missions to help Kosovo war victims,\\" and began raising funds for assistance to Kosovo. In September 2000, these plans finally took effect when Malaysia established a liaison office in Kosovo \\"to coordinate Malaysian assistance and to liaise with the Malaysian security personnel assigned to the United Nations,\\" becoming the sixth country, and the first in Asia, to establish such an office. The establishment of the office was in line with a broader Malaysian policy of self-determination in the Balkans, and a concern for the large Muslim population of Kosovo. The liaison office in Kosovo quickly began to disburse Malaysian aid, totalling more than $300,000 in the first year, including money to construct a mosque and purchase medical supplies for a hospital in Pristina. In the fall of 2000, the Malaysian government also strongly supported holding elections in Kosovo as soon as possible. On 28 September 2000, the Malaysian ambassador to the United Nations, Datuk Hasmy Agam, praised the progress towards elections, but told the UN that free and fair elections could \\"only be guaranteed by the active support of the international community\\". In the same speech, Agam also strongly advocated for new UN efforts to promote security and stability in Kosovo, and expressed a strong desire to work on the issue of missing persons. After successful municipal elections in Kosovo in October 2000, Malaysia pushed for a Kosovo-wide general election. On 18 September 2000, the first group of Malaysian policemen sent to Kosovo returned home. The next month, Malaysia sent a deployment of one hundred policemen to continue assisting the UN security effort. All of the Malaysian forces to serve in Kosovo up to that time received a medal and letter of appreciation in recognition of their services.  Recognition  Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008. The Malaysian foreign ministry issued a statement welcoming the declaration, and saying: \\"Malaysia hopes the declaration of independence fulfils the aspiration of the people of Kosovo to decide their own future and ensure the rights of all to live in peace, freedom and stability\\". Despite its supportive statement, Malaysia did not immediately recognise Kosovo, and Malaysian foreign minister Rais Yatim, issued a statement in April saying that Malaysia was \\"not in hurry to impose recognition or otherwise\\". In August, after a meeting with the Serbian foreign minister, Malaysia decided to put the issue of Kosovo's recognition on hold until a ruling of the International Court of Justice on the legality of the declaration. Kosovo, however, sought to pressure Malaysia for earlier recognition. In September 2008, Kosovo's foreign minister, Sk√´nder Hyseni, met with Rais and asked him \\"to recognise Kosovo as an independent and sovereign state as soon as possible\\". Rais provided Hyseni with a promise that Malaysia \\"would recognise Kosovo very soon, and would work on establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries\\". The Albanian Foreign Minister Edit Harxhi also made a similar request to Malaysia to recognise the newly formed country. As Rais had promised, Malaysia did not wait for the ICJ decision, and recognised Kosovo on 30 October 2008. As a result of Malaysia's recognition, Serbia immediately expelled the Malaysian ambassador. Despite the Serbian opposition, Malaysia maintained its support of Kosovo.  Relations since recognition  Since recognition, Malaysia has assisted Kosovo in establishing internationally recognised sports leagues. In November 2008, Valton Beqiri, the Minister of Culture, Youth, and Sports of Kosovo visited Malaysia and met with Tunku Imran, Chairman of the Malaysian Olympic Committee, and member of the International Olympic Committee. Imran pledged assistance in gaining spots for athletes from Kosovo in international tournaments. Malaysia initially planned to convert its liaison office in Kosovo into an embassy, but in January 2009, it closed the office and scrapped plans for an embassy for financial reasons due to re-organisation within the Malaysian foreign ministry. The Republic of Kosovo President, Fatmir Sejdiu, travelled on 15 May 2010 to Malaysia, where at the invitation of Malaysian Prime Minister, he took part at the International Islamic Economic Forum and met with other Leaders of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. At the forum, Sejdiu said that \\"On behalf of the Republic of Kosovo, I avail myself of this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for the people and the state of Malaysia and for other countries that have acknowledged our right to live in freedom and independence\\". On 8 March 2011, Kosovo and Malaysia established full diplomatic relations. The Malaysian embassy in Rome, Italy is accredited to Kosovo. On 30 January 2017, Kosovo's Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj and its delegates made a visit to Malaysia to discover opportunities in trade and business co-operation.

The twenty- fourth tropical cyclone, twenty-second tropical storm, fourteenth hurricane, and eighth major hurricane of the record breaking season, Tina formed from a tropical wave on September 17. The storm moved towards the west and strengthened into a hurricane. A breakdown in a ridge and to the north and a trough then re-curved Tina to the northeast and towards land, still moving slowly and gradually slowing down. The trough broke down and was replaced by a strong ridge. Tina then changed direction again and headed out to sea. It intensified into a Category 4 storm with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a central pressure of 932 millibars. Tina then slowly weakened as it turned to the north. Tropical Depression Tina dissipated on October 11, shortly after entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. Although the tropical cyclone never made landfall, heavy rains were recorded across western Mexico. While at peak intensity, the storm also displayed annular characteristics. Meteorological history Tina originated from a tropical wave that left the African coast on September 5. Six days later, the wave moved through the Lesser Antilles. The wave generated disorganized fare- ups while entering the Caribbean Sea, but due to strong wind shear further development failed to occur. On September 16, while about west of Acapulco, Mexico, the wave had entered the East Pacific basin. The system began to become more organized and at 1200 UTC on September 17, the NHC upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression, the twenty-second of the season, as the disturbance had changed dramatically in organization. The depression became Tropical Storm Tina on the next day. The system began an intensifying trend, and Tina strengthened into a moderate tropical storm 24 hours after attaining tropical storm status,and the NHC forecasted Tina to become a hurricane. As forecasted, Tina reached hurricane status at 1800 UTC on September 20. Tina reached a secondary peak of 85 mph (140 km/h) on the next day. By September 21, shear began to take a toll on the hurricane, as deep convection decreased. Tina briefly weakened back into a tropical storm, but regained hurricane intensity for another two days. However, data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicted that Tina had weakened back to tropical storm status, thus ending the first of three strengthening trends of Hurricane Tina. By September 24, Tropical Storm Tina took a sharp turn north-northeast towards the west coast of Mexico, due to a combination of a weakness in a subtropical ridge and a mid-level to low-level trough passing north of the tropical cyclone. Shortly thereafter, an anticyclone developed west of the Baja California Coast. By September 27, steering flow moved Tina away from the coast of Mexico, where there was little wind shear. The tropical storm then began to re-intensify. Tina regained hurricane status on September 28 as it accelerated. On September 28, Tina had reached major hurricane intensity. The next day, Tina continued intensify, becoming a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. Late on September 29, the storm\\"s pressure had fallen to 944 mbar and winds had increased to 145 mph (230 km/h) while Tina was located away from the Mexican coast. Overnight on September 30, Tina peaked with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 930 mbar. On October 1, the hurricane underwent fluctuations in intensity. Tina began to change its path over the next days due to an approaching trough which allowed Tina to turn northbound into cooler sea surface temperatures, as well as into an area of increasing wind shear. The eye became very large, peaking in size on October 4. However, the less favorable environment caused Tina to slowly weaken. The system weakened back to tropical storm status late on October 4. Tina's motion decreased due to weak steering currents. As such, Tina continued to weaken, and was downgraded into a tropical depression. At this time, only a swirl of clouds remained, with limited deep convection. The next day Tina moved into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility and six hours later, the storm's winds had dropped to 30 mph (45 km/h). Tina still maintained a small area of deep convection, despite decreasing seas surface temperatures, until dissipation on October 11. Records, preparations, and impact When Tropical Storm Tina was tracking northeastward toward Mexico, the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of landfall, although all of the tropical cyclone forecast models correctly indicated a westward turn would occur. While passing the region, Tina dropped heavy rainfall that produced flooding along the west coast of Mexico. Lasting 22 days, Hurricane Tina surpassed Hurricane Fico as the longest lived storm in the northeastern Pacific. Hurricane John (1994) became the longest-lived tropical cyclone in the northern Pacific a couple years later.

Various aspects and dimensions of female sexuality, as a part of human sexuality, have also been addressed by principles of ethics, morality, and theology. In almost any historical era and culture, the arts, including literary and visual arts, as well as popular culture, present a substantial portion of a given society's views on human sexuality, which include both implicit (covert) and explicit (overt) aspects and manifestations of feminine sexuality and behavior. In most societies and legal jurisdictions, there are legal bounds on what sexual behavior is permitted. Sexuality varies across the cultures and regions of the world, and has continually changed throughout history, and this also applies to female sexuality. Aspects of female sexuality include issues pertaining to biological sex, body image, self-esteem, personality, sexual orientation, values and attitudes, gender roles, relationships, activity options, and communication. While most women are heterosexual, significant minorities are homosexual or varying degrees of bisexual. Physiological =General= Sexual activity can encompass various sexually stimulating factors (physiological stimulation or psychological stimulation), including sexual fantasies and different sex positions, or the use of sex toys. Foreplay may precede some sexual activities, often leading to sexual arousal of the partners. It is also common for people to be sexually satisfied by being kissed, touched erotically, or held. =Orgasm= Orgasm, or sexual climax, is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual response cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region characterized by an intense sensation of pleasure. Women commonly find it difficult to experience orgasms during vaginal intercourse. Mayo Clinic states: \\"Orgasms vary in intensity, and women vary in the frequency of their orgasms and the amount of stimulation necessary to trigger an orgasm.\\" Additionally, some women may require more than one type of sexual stimulation in order to achieve orgasm. Clitoral stimulation in normal copulation happens when the thrusting of the penis moves the clitoral hood. Orgasm in women has typically been divided into two categories: clitoral and vaginal (or G-spot) orgasms. 70‚Äì80% of women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation may also be sufficient. Clitoral orgasms are easier to achieve because the glans of the clitoris, or clitoris as a whole, has more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings, which is as many (or more in some cases) nerve endings as are present in the human penis or glans penis. As the clitoris is homologous to the penis, it is the equivalent in its capacity to receive sexual stimulation. Although orgasms by vaginal stimulation are more difficult to achieve, the G-spot area may produce an orgasm if properly stimulated. The G-spot's existence, and existence as a distinct structure, is still under dispute, as its reported location can vary from woman to woman, appears to be nonexistent in some women, and it is hypothesized to be an extension of the clitoris and therefore the reason for orgasms experienced vaginally. Women are able to achieve multiple orgasms due to the fact that they generally do not require a refractory period like men do after the first orgasm. Although it is reported that women do not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first orgasm, some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because, due to clitoral hypersensitivity or sexual satisfaction, women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. Nipples can be sensitive to touch, and nipple stimulation can incite sexual arousal. Few women report experiencing orgasm from nipple stimulation. Before Komisaruk et al.'s functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) research on nipple stimulation in 2011, reports of women achieving orgasm from nipple stimulation relied solely on anecdotal evidence. Komisaruk's study was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; it indicates that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix, and that these reported orgasms are genital orgasms caused by nipple stimulation, and may be directly linked to the genital sensory cortex (\\"the genital area of the brain\\").  Sexual attraction  Women, on average, tend to be more attracted to men who have a relatively narrow waist, a V-shaped torso, and broad shoulders. Women also tend to be more attracted to men who are taller than they are, and display a high degree of facial symmetry, as well as relatively masculine facial dimorphism. Women, regardless of sexual orientation, tend to be less interested in a partner's physical attractiveness than men. Control of female sexuality Historically, many cultures have viewed female sexuality as being subordinate to male sexuality, and as something to be controlled through restrictions on female behavior. Traditional cultural practices, such as enforced modesty and chastity, have tended to place restrictions principally on women, without imposing similar restrictions on men.Review of General Psychology, by the Educational Publishing Foundation 2002, Vol. 6, No. 2, 166 ‚Äì203: Cultural Suppression of Female Sexuality According to psychoanalytic literature, the \\"Madonna‚Äìwhore complex\\" is said to occur when a male desires sexual encounters only with women whom he sees as degraded (\\"whores\\") while he cannot desire sexually a respectable woman (\\"the Madonna\\"). This was first described by Sigmund Freud.W. M. Bernstein, A Basic Theory of Neuropsychoanalysis (2011) p. 106 Some controversial traditional cultural practices, such as female genital mutilation (FGM), have been described as attempts at nullifying women's sexuality altogether. FGM continues to be practised in some parts of Africa and the Middle East, as well as in some immigrant communities in Western countries, though it is widely outlawed. The procedure is typically carried out on young girls, before the age of 15.WHO, February 2014: Female genital mutilationUNICEF: Female genital mutilation/cutting Methods employed to control female sexuality and behavior include the threat of death, such as honor killings. The reason for such a killing may include refusing to enter an arranged marriage, being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, having sex outside marriage, becoming the victim of rape, or dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate.https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/honor+killing?s=t Another historical device used to control female sexual behavior was the chastity belt, which is a locking item of clothing designed to prevent sexual intercourse. The belts were worn by women to protect their chastity, which included preventing masturbation or sexual access by unauthorized males.http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chastity+belt Prior to the European colonization of North America, Native American attitudes regarding female sexuality were generally open-minded, particularly for younger, un- married women. However, when Europeans arrived, more rigid views were enforced. These rigid views were especially restrictive for women, predominantly in Puritan colonies. Following the European colonization of North America, there was the creation of the African American archetypes of the Jezebel and mammy. The Jezebel was characterized as a woman who was lewd, tempting and seductive. Mammies, also called Aunt Jemima, were maternal figures who were portrayed as content within the institution of slavery ‚Äì always with a smile on her face as the white family took up her life and her entire world. These stereotyping frameworks not only justified slavery but also justified the rape and abuse of African American women as being sexually driven, sexual beings in the case of the Jezebel, or a being where sex and sexuality are the last things on a woman's mind because her world is taken up by the lives of her white masters in the case of the mammy. Modern studies In the modern age, psychologists and physiologists explored female sexuality. Sigmund Freud propounded the theory of two kinds of female orgasms, \\"the vaginal kind, and the clitoral orgasm.\\" However, Masters and Johnson (1966) and Helen O'Connell (2005) reject this distinction. Ernst Gr√§fenberg was famous for his studies of female genitalia and human female sexual physiology. He published, among other studies, the pioneering The Role of Urethra in Female Orgasm (1950), which describes female ejaculation, as well as an erogenous zone where the urethra is closest to the vaginal wall. In 1981, sexologists John D. Perry and Beverly Whipple named that area the Gr√§fenberg spot, or G-spot, in his honor. While the medical community generally has not embraced the complete concept of the G-spot, In terms of female psychological arousal, recent research by personality psychologist and biological anthropologist Gerulf Rieger in 2015 suggested that homosexual females experienced more male-typical sexual arousal to members of the same sex than heterosexual females did to members of the opposite sex, as well as being more masculine in non-sexual behaviours. Feminist views  In the 1970s and 1980s, long-held Western traditional views on female sexuality came to be challenged and reassessed as part of the sexual revolution. The feminist movement and numerous feminist writers addressed female sexuality from a female perspective, rather than allowing female sexuality to be defined in terms of male sexuality. One of the first such popular non-fiction books was Nancy Friday's My Secret Garden. Other writers, such as Germaine Greer, Simone de Beauvoir and Camille Paglia, were particularly influential, although their views were not universally or placidly accepted. Toward the end of the 20th century the most significant European contributions to understanding female sexuality came from psychoanalytical French feminism, with the work of Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva. Lesbianism and female bisexuality also emerged as topics of interest within feminism. The concept of political lesbianism, associated particularly with second wave feminism and radical feminism, includes, but is not limited to, lesbian separatism, notable proponents being Sheila Jeffreys and Julie Bindel. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have varied in scope throughout the movement's history. Generally, modern feminists advocate for all women to have access to sexual healthcare and education, and agree on the importance of reproductive health freedoms, particularly regarding issues such as birth control and family planning. Bodily autonomy and consent are also concepts of high importance in modern feminist views of female sexuality. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been more controversial topics among feminists. These debates culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism. Parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided on these issues. =Goddess movement= Anna Simon discussed in 2005 the importance of changing the dialogue surrounding female sexuality. The goddess movement and its members encourage finding power in femaleness, that one does not have to be masculine to be powerful, and that there is an innate strength in being female that all women and woman-aligned people should be able to feel comfortable in portraying. Legislation Laws around the world affect the expression of female sexuality, and the circumstances under which an individual may not engage sexually with a woman or girl. Forced sexual encounters are usually prohibited, though some countries may sanction rape in marriage. Age of consent laws, which differ between jurisdictions, set the minimum age at which a minor girl may engage in sex. In recent years, the age of consent has risen in some jurisdictions and been lowered in others. In some countries there are laws against pornography and prostitution (or certain aspects of those). Laws in some jurisdictions prohibit sex outside of marriage, such as premarital sex or adultery, with critics arguing that, in practice, these laws are used to control women's and not men's behavior. The virginity and family honor of women still play an important role in some legal systems: in some jurisdictions, the punishment for rape is more severe if the woman was a virgin at the time of the crime, and under some legal systems a man who rapes a woman can escape punishment if he marries her.http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1720&context;=jiws Women as responsible for sexual safety With regard to the responsibility for safe sexual activity in heterosexual relationships, the commonly held definition of safe sex may be examined; it has been argued that there are three facets to the common perception of safe sex: emotional safety (trusting one's partner), psychological safety (feeling safe), and biomedical safety (the barrier of fluids which may cause pregnancy or transmit disease). The phrase \\"safe sex\\" is commonly known to refer to biomedical safety.Bourne, Adam H., and Margaret A. Robson. \\"Perceiving risk and (re)constructing safety: The lived experience of having 'safe' sex.\\" Health, Risk & Safety. 11.3 (2009): 283‚Äì295. Print. Since the sexual revolution, health officials have launched campaigns to bring awareness to the risks of unprotected sexual intercourse. While the dangers of unprotected sex include unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs), with HIV/AIDS being the deadliest, the use of contraceptive devices (the most reliable being condoms) remain inconsistent. The social construction of masculinity and femininity play a lead role in understanding why women are commonly held responsible for the outcome of sexual encounters. Often, societies create different sexual norms and assumptions for women and men, with female and male sexuality often seen as being the opposite of one another: for example, females are commonly taught that they \\"should not want sexual activity or find it pleasurable, or have sexual relations outside of marriage,\\" while males are commonly taught to \\"feel entitled to have sexual relations and pleasure and that their self-worth is demonstrated through their sexual prowess and notions of authority and power\\".https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/sexual_health/defining_sexual_health.pdf Sexual interactions often take place in unequal structural circumstances in the context of imbalance of power between men and women.http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/sex.and.gender/Readings/DownSoLong-- Sexuality.pdf Feminists, such as Catharine Mackinnon, have stated that the inequality in which heterosexual intercourse takes place should not be ignored and should play a crucial role in policies; Mackinnon has argued: \\"The assumption is that women can be unequal to men economically, socially, culturally, politically, and in religion, but the moment they have sexual interactions, they are free and equal. That's the assumption ‚Äì and I think it ought to be thought about, and in particular what consent then means.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety Socially constructed masculinity might suggest that men are constantly interested in sex, and that once men are sexually aroused, they must be satisfied through orgasm. This drive is intertwined with the male identity and consequently creates a momentum that, once started, is difficult to stop. Socially constructed femininity might suggest the connotation of passivity, which has affected the cultural importance of female desire. This is a factor that contributes to women's sexual desires being largely ignored; because men are seen as unable to control their sexuality, this can make women responsible for enforcing condom use instead of the \\"uncontrollable\\" male. Some scholars argue that a contributing factor in this division of responsibility for safe sex factors is the privileged status of male desire in Western culture, as indicated by the commonly held belief that the female sexual experience is not adversely affected by condom use but that the male sexual experience is diminished with the addition of this barrier.Garvey, Nicola, Kathryn McPhillips, and Marion Doherty. Trans. Array The Kaleidoscope of Gender: Prisms, patterns, and possibilities. Joan Z. Spade and Catherine G. Valentine. 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press, 2011. 323‚Äì332. Print. They believe that this is problematic, as the use of condoms is symbolically linked to casual sex and promiscuity, which goes against the social norms of femininity.Cook, Catherine. \\"'Nice girls don't': women and the condom conundrum.\\" Journal of Clinical Nursing. 21. (2011): 535‚Äì543. Print. This link is considered something that cannot be underestimated as \\"discontinuation of condom use becomes a test or a marker which signifies the existence of a committed and exclusive relationship,\\" and demonstrates trust. Others speculate that the responsibility for condom use falling on women is not so much imposed by society, but is instead resultant of the possible consequences of unprotected sex being generally more serious for women than men (pregnancy, greater likelihood of STI transmission, etc.). Bacterial STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, show that rates among women can be three times higher than men in high prevalence areas of the United States, and one-fourth of pregnancies in developing countries and one-half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Another social idea of sexuality is the coital imperative. The coital imperative is the idea that for sex to be real, there must be penile-vaginal intercourse. For many women, this imposes limitations to the sexual possibilities and a condom is seen as a symbol of the end of the sexual experience. Public acceptance of penis-vagina penetration as central to a sexual relationship is reinforced by the focus on condom use.McPhillips, Kathryn, Virginia Braun, and Nicola Gavey. \\"Defining (Hetero)Sex: How imperative is the \\"coital imperative\\"?.\\" Women's Studies International Form. 24.2 (2001): 229‚Äì240. Print. These ideas, male sex drive and coital imperative, paired with the social construction of femininity, may lead to an imbalance of the power in making the decision to use a condom.

This can be a problem in contexts where a body organised on an all-island basis needs to be represented by a flag in an international context. The island is politically divided into the Republic of Ireland (a sovereign state comprising 26 of Ireland's 32 traditional counties) and Northern Ireland (comprising the remaining 6 counties in the north-east of Ireland, and a part of the United Kingdom), but all-island organisations are common. Examples include the Catholic Church in Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Church of Ireland, the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Orange Order, Scouting Ireland and the Irish Rugby Football Union. Saint Patrick's Saltire The Saint Patrick's Saltire was incorporated into the Union Flag in 1801 by way of the Act of Union 1800 to represent Ireland within the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Church of Ireland orders that, apart from the flag of the Anglican Communion, only this saltire may be flown on its church grounds‚Äîas opposed to the tricolour, the Union Flag or the former flag of Northern Ireland. This follows the practice of other Anglican churches in England, Scotland, and Wales, which fly the flags of their respective patron saints instead of the Union Flag.: Resolution One: The General Synod of the Church of Ireland recognises that from time to time confusion and controversy have attended the flying of flags on church buildings or within the grounds of church buildings. This Synod therefore resolves that the only flags specifically authorised to be flown on church buildings or within the church grounds of the Church of Ireland are the cross of St Patrick or, alternatively, the flag of the Anglican Communion bearing the emblem of the Compassrose. Such flags are authorised to be flown only on Holy Days and during the Octaves of Christmas, Easter, the Ascension of Our Lord and Pentecost, and on any other such day as may be recognised locally as the Dedication Day of the particular church building. Any other flag flown at any other time is not specifically authorised by this Church. The saltire is also flown by the Catholic St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, on graduation days. Modified versions have been used formerly by the Irish Rugby Football Union, and currently by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. Irish tricolour The tricolour of green, white and orange, the official flag of the state of Ireland, is considered by Irish nationalists to represent the entire island as well. However, this symbolism is rejected by Ulster unionists, as illustrated by an exchange in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland in 1951: The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) flies this flag at matches regardless of whether either or both teams are from Northern Ireland. It is also used for the Ireland international rules football team, selected by the GAA on an all-island basis. The Golfing Union of Ireland covers the whole island and competes under the tricolour in international events such as the World Cup, Alfred Dunhill Cup and the Eisenhower Trophy. Four Provinces flag The four provinces flag is a quartering of the arms of the four provinces of Ireland. The order of the provinces varies. Various all-Ireland sports teams and organisations use the Four Provinces Flag of Ireland and a four province Crest of Ireland, including the Ireland field hockey team, Ireland rugby league team, Irish rugby union team and Irish Amateur Boxing Association. Erne flag This flag was initially used on the Shannon‚ÄìErne Waterway, which is bisected by the border. Rather than flying a national flag, boats fly this green, white and blue flag. It is endorsed by the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, an all-island organisation. Harp flags The harp (or ') has long been a symbol of Ireland, being first recorded in a French roll of arms known as the Armorial Wijnbergen, which dates to the late 13th century. It first featured on Irish coins in the reign of Henry VIII around 1534. During the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the harp became adorned with progressively more decoration, ultimately becoming a \\"winged maiden\\". In the nineteenth century, the Maid of Erin, a personification of Ireland, was a woman holding a more realistic harp than the \\"winged maiden\\". This style of harp was then also used in Irish flags. The harp on the modern coat of arms of Ireland is modelled on the \\"Brian Boru\\" harp in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, as it appeared after an 1840s restoration. =Blue harp flag= The lower left quadrant of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom has featured a harp on a blue field, representing Ireland since 1603. The current version, designed in 1953, uses a winged-maiden harp and consists of a golden ' with silver strings on a blue background. The shade of blue in the field was known as Saint Patrick's Blue when used in 1783 for the regalia of the Order of Saint Patrick. =Green harp flag= The change from blue to green is associated with the United Irishmen, an Irish nationalist movement associated with both Catholic and Protestant Irish ‚Äì its leader Wolfe Tone was Protestant; green was a colour of rebellion in the eighteenth century.Naval Service - Flags and Pennants This was a common flag used to represent Ireland during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It consisted of a gold ' on a green background. It was associated with moderate nationalism at a time when the tricolour was confined to more radical movements. It is the same as the modern Flag of Leinster. Sporting flags Several all-island sporting organisations send representative teams to compete internationally. In some cases, a flag unique to that organisation is used in lieu of a national flag. Typically such flags include one of the traditional symbols of Ireland. The Ireland cricket team uses a blue flag depicting shamrocks. The Ireland national field hockey team uses a bespoke flag with a shield quartered with the symbols of the four provinces. The Ireland rugby team's flag is a green flag containing the shields of the four provinces and the Irish Rugby Football Union's logo. At matches outside Ireland, this is the only flag displayed. At matches in Northern Ireland (typically at Ravenhill) the Flag of Ulster (yellow background) is also displayed. This is the flag of the nine-county province (including the three Ulster counties in the Republic of Ireland), similar to but distinct from the Ulster Banner (white background), the former flag of the Northern Irish government. At matches in the Republic of Ireland (typically at Lansdowne Road), the Irish tricolour is flown along with the preceding two. Eddie Irvine, a Formula One driver from Conlig in Northern Ireland, asked for a white flag with a shamrock to be used if he secured a podium finish. There had been controversy when an Irish tricolour had been used incorrectly for him in 1997. The FIA insisted the Union Flag be used in conformance with its regulations. The Show Jumping Association of Ireland (SJAI; subsequently renamed Showjumping Ireland) used a green flag with its crest based on the four provinces when competing internationally, from its formation after the Second World War. In FEI Nations Cup events, Ireland was represented by the Irish Army Equitation School under the tricolour. From the late 1960s, the SJAI joined forces with the army in FEI competitions and competed under the tricolour, although it retained its own flag in other competitions until the late 1970s.

Plot The film consists of a series of scenes, the chronological order of which is ambiguous, loosely relaying the experiences of the protagonist Victor Marse (Lars von Trier), whose actual name is Felimann von Marseburg. Victor is introduced by means of voice-over narration (Jesper Hoffmeyer) as a young artist of Jewish descent who has shunned his heritage. He is described as having arrived at the realisation that he is alone, doubting humanity's willingness to extend help to one another. It is further narrated that during a previous period in his life he had been referred to as a wimp, which has subsequently resulted in a fear of weakness and being incapable. Victor believes that he must keep his mind busy and therefore decides to cultivate his love for Eliza, a young nurse he encounters during his stay at a sanatorium. Whilst in residence at the sanatorium, Victor observes the intimate friendship between Eliza and her female friend, also a nurse. It is suggested they are lovers. It is ambiguous as to which nurse is specifically Eliza, which is further enunciated by a recurring voice-over that states ‚ÄòI am not Eliza‚Äô. Victor is portrayed as exhibiting a sense of dependence upon the nurses; in one scene he waits upon one nurse to dry and swaddle him in a towel following a shower, and in the following scene he is confined to a wheelchair. He is wheeled through the gardens of the sanatorium by one of the nurses, potentially Eliza, towards whom he expresses a tenderness by clasping her hand. Victor and the accompanying nurse pass a gardener and a woman painting on a large canvas, both of whom Victor greets with a smile. Arriving at a tree, the nurse gathers handfuls of blossoms, which she begins to gently sprinkle onto Victor's hair. She is interrupted by the call of another nurse, Eliza's friend. Leaving Victor seated in his chair, the nurses walk into the distance, with Eliza's friend retrieving from her pocket a condom, prompting laughter from both. Victor looks on with a forlorn expression. The sky becomes clouded; the camera tracks along the ground, displaying the painter's canvas and easel as scattered along the grass, with the painter nowhere to be seen. Eliza dashes back to Victor, who is still seated, and wheels him along, harshly dusting the blossoms from his head in the process. Victor is shown in a household setting, presumably following his period in the sanatorium. He looks on at a woman, one of the former nurses who is now dressed in masculine attire. The narrator describes that Victor had studied women and had come to the conclusion that women always despise that which is weak, driving him to dream of strengthening himself. This narration is accompanied by a scene in which a young child is thrashed and locked in a room by an older, unknown woman; the woman, situated on the other side of the locked door, masturbates against the backdrop of the child's distressed cries. Returning to the antics of Victor, Victor dons a Nazi military uniform whilst sat before a tabletop mirror. In contrast to the masculine overtones of the garment he applies mascara to his eyes and powder to his face. In the following scene he intensely studies the former nurse brushing her hair and applying cream to her face; as she hums the melody of Lili Marleen, Victor runs his hands along the outline of the head and shoulders, never directly touching her skin. Following this, Victor is shown outside in a derelict urban setting, adjusting his trousers. A doll's pram overturned in the background, and it is indicated by the narrator that Victor has assaulted a young girl. Eliza, Eliza's friend and Victor attend a cinema screening. While Eliza and her friend sit side by side, an empty chair separates Victor from the couple. The film displays a male and female couple in the midst of an incomprehensible dialogue; while the male figure becomes increasingly animated and emotional, the female figure remains coolly composed and disaffected by the male figure's erratic gesticulations. Eliza and her friend exchange amused glances, while Victor, who sports painted nails, gazes intensely at the screen whilst tightly holding a furled flyer featuring a painting of a man. Once the film concludes, Victor is left alone in the auditorium. Victor is shown wearing female attire, applying make-up once more, gazing into his tabletop mirror. Running his hands over the contours of his face, he looks into his own reflection for a moment before approaching a nearby birdcage. He removes the bird inside, a pigeon, and rings its neck until the head is removed. He returns to the mirror, dabbing his finger into the head's open wound, using the blood as rouge for his cheeks. In an abrupt change of pace, the next scene shows Victor running frantically down an enclosed street, collapsing as he reaches a dead end. He is then shown at the seashore, perched upon the edge of a pier. The narrator describes how Victor fantasises a hand caressing his own. Victor becomes briefly lost in his imagination, believing a hand to touch his own, only to realise that he is daydreaming and is actually alone. Back in the household Victor suspends himself from the ceiling, giving the impression of having hung himself. His female companion, one of the former-nurses, enters the house and eventually arrives at the room in which Victor is hanging. She is not startled and conversely strolls towards the window behind Victor before departing. Infuriated by her response, Victor cuts himself free and flings off the harness that had been supporting him. He runs from the room. The following scenes show Victor descending into greater anxiety and violence. His sleep is interrupted by distress. He sits for long, inert periods besides an empty canvas. It is implied that he is so bothered by the song of the birds outside of his atelier that he hammers them by their wings against a wall and sets them alight. Finally, he is shown holding a gun to his female companion. She remains composed, as she turns her back to Victor and extends her hand across the wall. She turns back to face him and tells Victor that she cherishes him the way he is, that he should give her a chance, and that it would be foolish for him to shoot her. She asks him why he has never wished to be caressed. Victor's hand tremors and he throws the gun aside. The camera cuts to a wide shot, revealing that the female companion is not clothed except for trousers and a tie; she presents Victor with a whip, which she begins to coat with a viscous substance followed by a white, granular powder. Watching intently, Victor begins to undress. Clasping his head and body, Victor walks down a mostly empty street. He walks with a pained gait, which increasingly falters. An elderly woman collapses in the distance and a crowd begins to gather, although they do not actually help her but instead stare at her body. Victor remains unacknowledged as he staggers on, almost collapsing entirely. The scenes fades to an image of a nude Victor, collapsed in front of the large canvas, drawn-out hand prints running down the length of the canvas. In the final scenes of the film Victor is shown driving a hearse to an orchid nursery. As he drives, an English language commercial discouraging smoking plays from the hearse's radio. After removing a formal jacket and bowtie, revealing that he is wearing gardener overalls, he retrieves a cap from inside of the coffin situated in the back of the hearse and then attends to work in the nursery. The narrator states that Victor truly cherished Eliza, to which a female voice responds ‚ÄòNo, not Eliza‚Äô. The film concludes with a priest driving a wooden cross into the ground.

It is a Grade I listed building. The manor of Elemore was owned prior to the Dissolution of the Monasteries by the Priory of Finchale. It was sold to Bertram Anderson, Mayor and Sheriff of Newcastle upon Tyne, who built a manor house in about 1550. The estate passed from Anderson to Hall and then by marriage to Thomas Conyers MP for Durham City 1702-22. In about 1700 Elizabeth Conyers, heiress of the estate, married George Baker, also MP for Durham City, of Crook Hall, near Lanchester. Their son George Baker inherited the manor in 1723 and in about 1750 replaced the old manor house with the present mansion to a design by architect Robert Shout of Hemsley. The house follows the E-plan of the old manor but on a much grander scale. The three storey, seven bayed entrance front has a pedimented three bayed projecting central block and two flanking and projecting pedimented single bay wings. In 1844 Isabella Baker heiress married the son of her aunt and first cousin, Henry Tower. On inheriting the property he changed his name to Henry Baker Baker. He was High Sheriff of Durham in 1854. The Baker Baker family lived at the Hall until the 1930s. In 1947 the estate was sold to Durham County Council. The Hall has since then been occupied by a local education authority day and residential special school.

Founded in 1961 in the former Czechoslovakia, the festival gradually gained international attention. The audience consists mainly of children and youth from the Zl√≠n region, but also university students and adult visitors who come to late-night screenings with appropriate dramaturgy, as well as film professionals from around the world. The anniversary 60th Zl√≠n Film Festival will be held from 29 May to 6 June 2020.  History  Zl√≠n skyscraper at night The establishment of a regular film festival in Zl√≠n was the result of efforts by local filmmakers to present their work in a local atmosphere. The first festival took place in 1961, 20 years after a previous film festival had been held in Zl√≠n, named Film Harvest () or Zliennale. Film Harvest, held in the war years 1940‚Äì41, attracted most of the stars of that period's highly productive and internationally successful Czech and Slovak films. The main program was held in Zl√≠n's Grand Cinema, the largest cinema in Central Europe at that time. The capacity of the building, completed in 1932, was over 2,500. The Grand Cinema is still open today, and hosts the opening ceremony of the festival. In 1936, entrepreneur Jan Anton√≠n Ba≈•a founded a new film studio in the city, which gradually turned into Czechoslovakia's most prominent centre of filmmaking focused on children and youth. Film-makers such as Karel Zeman, Herm√≠na T√Ωrlov√°, Alexandr Hackenschmied, B≈ôetislav Pojar and Josef Pinkava created their works in the Zl√≠n film studios. The town's film-making tradition continues today in its two film schools.  Programme  Opening film The competitive sections of the festival include new films shot within the last two years. They are accompanied by films from other festivals and classic works of world cinema. Apart from the five competitive sections, the festival includes a number of informative and retrospective sections, including full- length documentary films. Each year the cinematography of one European nation showcased. = Competition Sections = *International Competition of Feature Films for Children *International Competition of Feature Films for Youth *International Competition of Short Animated Films for Children *Competition of European First Feature Films *Competition of European Documentary Films for Young Audience *Zl√≠n Dog - International Competition of Student Films = Out- of-competition Sections = *New Czech Film and TV Programmes: Presentation of Czech cinema and TV production from the year. *Panorama: Informative section ‚Äì presents mostly films awarded at other festivals which cannot compete in one of the competitive sections. *Young Stars Films introducing young actors whom the audience can meet in person in Zl√≠n. = Supporting program = Entertainment at the festival Apart from the film projections, the festival offers a supporting programme of charity and entertainment, including concerts, exhibitions, public readings, and parties. The specialist part of the programme includes mostly classes, lectures and workshops. The festival also includes a supporting programme for the Film Industry. One festival project is the Cinematrain, a railway car modified into a projection room that travels around the Czech Republic and Slovakia for a few weeks before the film festival. The festival is also the annual end of the Minisalon project - an auction of artistically rendered film. Czech artists and other celebrities design these film clapperboards during the autumn and winter. The collection of art works is then displayed and auctioned off during the film festival. The funds raised from their auction go to support student film productions.

Taking inspiration from Ren√© Descartes,Fustel wrote late in life, \\"Jules Simon explained Descartes' Discours sur la m√©thode to me thirty years ago, and from that come all my works: for I have applied to history this Cartesian doubt which he introduced to my mind\\" (J. W. Thompson, A History of Historical Writing, vol. 2, New York: Macmillan, 1942, p. 363). and based on texts of ancient historians and poets, the author investigates the origins of the most archaic institutions of Greek and Roman society. In the preface of the book, he warns of the error that lies in examining the habits of ancient people with reference to those of today, when it is necessary to avoid our biases and study ancient peoples in the light of the facts. Fustel de Coulanges sees religion and cult as the foundation of the institutions of the Greeks and Romans. Each family had their belief, their gods, and their worship. The rules of gender and family hierarchy, ownership, inheritance, etc., were governed by that cult. Over time, need has led men to regularize and make more consistent their relations with one another, and the rules that govern the family were transferred to increasingly larger units, arriving eventually at the city. Therefore, the origin of the city is also religious, as is witnessed by the practice of lustration, a periodic purification ceremony in connection with the census of all citizens, and by the public banquets in honor of local gods. The laws originally encoded the privileges of the aristocracy, causing great discomfort to the plebs and a social revolution in which the common well-being of society became the new basis of religion. The city thus came into being for some time, until its extinction with the arrival of Christianity.

The castle stands at what was once a defensible point, guarding the city pier and crossing over the river Sava, and was predated on the site by a round 11th-century keep. The current structure was built in 1256 by the counts of Ortenburg, by an arrangement with the lord of Kranj, Ulrich III, Duke of Carinthia. Until 1420, the tower was managed by their ministeriales or vassals, the knights von Chreinburch; in that year, it passed to Count Hermann II of Celje. During the period of Turkish incursions, the tower was incorporated into the city walls. After the extinction of the Counts of Celje in 1456, it was inherited by the Habsburgs, who sold it in the mid 16th century to Baron Hans Khiessl. Khiessl successfully petitioned Emperor Ferdinand I for the right to rename the castle after himself, and also expanded the tower into an L-shaped castle, giving it its present appearance. The Khiessls soon sold the castle to Franz von Moscon; later owners included the Ravbar, Apfaltrer, Auersperg and finally Natalis Pagliaruzzi noble families. In 1913 the castle was purchased by the state. Between the world wars, it housed government offices; after World War II it was (somewhat redundantly) nationalized. In 1952, the building was renovated according to plans drawn up by the architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik. Today the renovated building houses the Kranj Municipal Agency for the Protection of Natural and Cultural Heritage, as well as the Upper Carniola Museum.

Knopf. Correction‚Äôs setting is a garret in the middle of an Austrian forest, described by the narrator as the \\"thought dungeon\\" in which the main character, Roithamer, will pursue his project of constructing an extraordinary habitation, the Cone, as a present for his beloved sister. Roithamer is deeply attached to his sister; this does not, however, prevent his provoking her death, which occurs on the very day that she moves into this conic house that he has built for her with formidable effort, in the Kobernausser forest. Roithamer has unwittingly killed his sister by forcing her to inhabit a house that was completely contrary to her own nature. Plot summary The Austrian main character Roithamer, lecturer at Cambridge, after years of paroxystic projects, builds for his sister, the only person he ever loved, a house in the shape of a cone, right in the geometrically precise middle of the Kobernausser forest. Her answer to the present is death, her traumatic death on entering the Cone. This cone (see it as you will‚Äîa multitude of symbols, such as a refuge, a mausoleum, a phallic icon, the perfect mathematical centre of existence and thought, etc.) is then destined to disappear, absorbed by an invading Nature, eternal nemesis. A typical Bernhardian maniacal character, Roithamer corrects his building project ad infinitum, and ultimately corrects it to its extreme self-correction: suicide. Correction unravels between love and spite, humanity and degradation, hypocrisy and violence, sickness and death, in a crescendo that brings madness to a dramatic threshold of absolute lucidity. Imagery and themes The first part of the book has the narrator telling Roithamer‚Äôs story in the third person; the last part opens with the narrator still nominally telling Roithamer‚Äôs story in the third person, but gradually begins to speak directly in Roithamer‚Äôs voice, reading portions of his manuscript, where a sort of diary was kept whilst planning and building the Cone. This manuscript was in fact the focus of Roithamer's thousands of corrections, and it becomes apparent that it is being rewritten, ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù once again, this time through the voice of the narrator, who begins, ominously, to disappear into the language of the text. Roithamer‚Äôs story becomes increasingly obsessive and mad as it describes the construction of the Cone and the death of his sister. It concludes with the rationalisation of suicide, ending with the sentence, ‚ÄúThe end is no process. Clearing,‚Äù and the narrator‚Äôs own voice totally dissolved into the text. Allusions/references to actual events Wittgenstein's House, Vienna. Bernhard used Ludwig Wittgenstein‚Äôs biography to intersperse aspects of Roithamer‚Äôs life with similarities and create at times a parallel narration. Wittgenstein was born into great wealth, went to Cambridge, lived austerely, worked obsessively, and spent years carefully designing and building a house for his sister (currently the Bulgarian Cultural Institute in Vienna: Haus Wittgenstein). Other elements of Roithamer come from Bernhard‚Äôs own troubled life: his love of the Austrian countryside, his hate of the Austrian state (in his famous will, he prohibited the publication or production of any of his works in Austria), and the bitter relationship with his mother. Narrative style Literary critics often compare Bernhard‚Äôs writing with Franz Kafka‚Äôs or that of Samuel Beckett. But Bernhard‚Äôs style has its own peculiarities, a profoundly innovative form, and a much darker edge. Whilst the characters and situations in Correction are as comical and sometimes as absurd as those of the above two modernists, they are also based on historical reality and a precise geography. As a result, there is a surprising weight and closeness to the existential ground his characters ultimately tread upon. When Bernhard‚Äôs satire bends into horror as the novel progresses, there is little allegorical distance for the reader to retreat into. The culminating tragedy feels both personal and claustrophobic. References *Bernhardiana, a Critical Anthology of Bernhard's works *\\"On Thomas Bernhard\\" by Jason M.

The dynasty is above all known for the experiences of the Upper Salm branch which came to be located at Ch√¢teau de Salm in the Vosges mountain range and over time came to rule over a principality whose capital was Badonviller then Senones. History Salmch√¢teau The noble family possibly descended from Count Palatine Wigeric of Lotharingia (d. before 923), the founder of the House of Ardenne. His presumable son Sigfried (d. 997) appeared as first Count of Luxembourg about 950. Sigfried's grandson Giselbert (d. 1059), is documented as a Count of Salm in 1036 and as Count of Luxembourg in 1047. When he divided his estates among his heirs, his younger son Hermann received the County of Salm and thereby became the progenitor of the comital dynasty. During the Great Saxon Revolt, he even was elected German anti-king in opposition to King Henry IV in 1081, however, he remained isolated until his death in 1088. In 1163, Hermann's grandson Count Henry I of Salm (d. before 1174) again divided the estates among his son Henry II and his daughter Elizabeth, who had married Frederick II, Count of Vianden. Henry II received the County of Upper Salm in the Vosges, while Elizabeth and Frederick II founded the comital line of Lower Salm in the Ardennes. =Lower Salm= The descendants of Elizabeth and Frederick became extinct in 1416. Their possessions were inherited by the Lords of Reifferscheid, who resided at Reifferscheid Castle. The succession arrangement was challenged by the Raugraves, however, they had to accept a 1456 judgement by the Luxembourg councillor Antoine I de Cro√ø. Coat of Arms Altgrave Salm-Reifferscheidt-Raitz The Salm-Reifferscheid line was later divided into the branches of Salm-Reifferscheid-Bedburg/Krautheim,Salm- Reifferscheidt-Raitz and Salm-Reifferscheid-Dyck (extinct in 1888). =Upper Salm= Ruins of Ch√¢teau de Salm The Counts of Upper Salm resided at Ch√¢teau de Salm in Alsace, where they had to compete with the neighbouring Prince- Bishops of Strasbourg and the Dukes of Lorraine. In 1475, half of the estates were inherited by the Rhinegraves; the remaining half passed to the Lorraine dukes in 1600. The Rhinegraves began to call themselves Counts of Salm too, they were raised to princes in 1623. Their line included several cadet branches ruling over minor principalities such as Salm-Salm, Salm-Horstmar, and Salm-Kyrburg.

The legislation's formal title is the Sundry Civil Appropriations Act of 1897, which was signed into law on June 4, 1897, by President William McKinley. This law was the first step toward legislation concerning the management, protection and care of the nation's forest reserves. Its features include: #It specified the purpose for establishing reserves as well as the administration and protection. #It granted the Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior the authority in rule-making and regulations of reserves. #It allowed the General Land Office (GLO) to hire employees for the necessary administrative tasks and opened the reserves for public use. #It specifically stated the criteria for new forest reserve designations, which were timber production, watershed protection and forest protection. #It gave the United States Geological Survey (USGS) the responsibility for mapping the reserves. This last item gave two separate branches of the Department of Interior responsibility-The GLO for the sale, claims and administration of the reserves and the USGS for the drawing of boundaries and land maps.Godfrey pp.46-47 > According to the Organic Act, the intention of the forest reservations was > \\"to improve and protect the forest within the reservation, ... securing > favorable conditions of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of > timber for the use and necessities of citizens of the United States.\\" > Foresthistory.org This law is one of two of the most important legislative events in US Forest Service history (the other being the Transfer Act of 1905). The nation now had forest reserves and the means to protect and manage them. The basic elements of federal forestry were now established.Steen, Harold K. pp.36-37 Interior Department changes As instructed by the new law, a Division of Geography and Forestry was set up within the USGS. Henry Gannet was the new division's chief and produced surveys of the reserves that were of high quality and provided basic information necessary for effective management. These surveys, which included an atlas, were impressive, even today.Steen p.51 The Interior Department's Land Office section tried for a brief period to develop its capability to manage the reserves. Filibert Roth became the head of the General Land Office's \\"Division R\\"-the Forestry Division on November 15, 1901 and resigned two years later, in 1903. Gifford Pinchot, of the United States Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry at this time, advocated for the removal of the reserves from Interior and placed under the Agriculture Department so that the forest reserves and the foresters would all be under one department. He also had a poor opinion of the Land Office due to \\"land office routine, political stupidity and wrong-headed points of view. \\"Steen pp. 60-61 A campaign was mounted toward this goal by Pinchot as well as the American Foresters Association and the Sierra Club. Finally, the effort paid off on Feb. 1905 when President Roosevelt signed into law the Forest Transfer Act.Steen p.74 Izaak Walton League lawsuit The Izaak Walton League, a conservation group formed in 1922, that sought the complete abolishment of livestock grazing on national forest lands in the 1930s. The League's Los Angeles chapter petitioned Region 5 of the Forest Service to immediately and absolutely abolish all grazing permits of both sheep and cattle from California's national forest lands. The League's position was that sheep grazing was a costly mistake and a man-made hazard to forests and watersheds, that cattle grazing had been too heavy and that both types of livestock hindered wildlife.Godfrey p.271 In May 1973, the League successfully sued the Department of Agriculture over the clear-cut logging practices in the Monongahela National Forest as being contrary to the Organic Act of 1897 which stated that only \\"dead, physically mature and large growth trees \\"individually marked for cutting\\" could be sold.

For the origins of the modern-day religion of Judaism, see Origins of Rabbinic Judaism. The origins of Judaism according to the current historical view, in contradistinction to the religious account as described in the text of the Hebrew Bible, lie in the Bronze Age amidst polytheistic ancient Semitic religions, specifically evolving out of Ancient Canaanite polytheism, then co-existing with Babylonian religion, and syncretizing elements of Babylonian belief into the worship of Yahweh as reflected in the early prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible. During the Iron Age I, the Israelite religion became distinct from the Canaanite polytheism out of which it evolved. This process began with the development of Yahwism, the monolatristic worship of Yahweh that gave acknowledgment to the existence, but suppressed the worship, of other Canaanite gods. Later, this monolatristic belief cemented into a strict monotheistic belief and worship of Yahweh alone, with the rejection of the existence of all other gods, whether Canaanite or foreign. During the Babylonian captivity of the 6th and 5th centuries BCE (Iron Age II), certain circles within the exiled Judahites in Babylon refined pre-existing ideas about their Yahweh-centric monolatrism, election, divine law and Covenant into a strict monotheistic theology which came to dominate the former Kingdom of Judah in the following centuries. From the 5th century BCE until 70 CE, Israelite religion developed into the various theological schools of Second Temple Judaism, besides Hellenistic Judaism in the diaspora. Second Temple eschatology have similarities with Zoroasternism .The text of the Hebrew Bible was redacted into its extant form in this period and possibly also canonized as well. Rabbinic Judaism developed during Late Antiquity, during the 3rd to 6th centuries CE; the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud were compiled in this period. The oldest manuscripts of the Masoretic tradition come from the 10th and 11th centuries CE; in the form of the Aleppo Codex of the later portions of the 10th century CE and the Leningrad Codex dated to 1008‚Äì1009 CE. Due largely to censoring and the burning of manuscripts in medieval Europe the oldest existing manuscripts of various rabbinical works are quite late. The oldest surviving complete manuscript copy of the Babylonian Talmud is dated to 1342 CE. Overview Judaism has its origins in the Iron Age Kingdom of Judah and in Second Temple Judaism. It has three essential and related elements: study of the written Torah (the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy); the recognition of Israel (defined as the descendants of Abraham through his grandson Jacob) as a people elected by God as recipients of the law at Mount Sinai, his chosen people; and the requirement that Israel live in accordance with God's laws as given in the Torah. Monarchic period Yahwism Image on a pithos sherd found at Kuntillet Ajrud below the inscription \\"Yahweh and his Asherah\\", depicting the two as bulls with the androgynous Egyptian deity Bes. The two standing figures are sometimes seen as a representation of the divine couple, while the seated lyre-player behind them is an entertainer. Alternatively, many art historians identify the standing figures as representations of Bes, on account of their distinctively bovine faces. Ziony Zevit has argued that Yahweh was represented as a Bes-figure, though there is little evidence for this. It is also possible that the images on the pot have nothing to do with the inscription at all. The Iron Age kingdoms of Israel (or Samaria) and Judah first appear in the 9th century BCE. The two kingdoms shared Yahweh as their national god, for which reason their religion is commonly called Yahwism. Other neighbouring Canaanite kingdoms of the time each had their own national gods: Chemosh was the god of Moab, Moloch the god of the Ammonites, Qaus the god of the Edomites, and so on, and in each kingdom the king was his god's viceroy on Earth. The various national gods were more or less equal, reflecting the fact that kingdoms themselves were more or less equal, and within each kingdom a divine couple, made up of the national god and his consort ‚Äì Yahweh and the goddess Asherah in Israel and Judah ‚Äì headed a pantheon of lesser gods. By the late 8th century both Judah and Israel had become vassals of Assyria, bound by treaties of loyalty on one side and protection on the other. Israel rebelled and was destroyed c. 722 BCE, and refugees from the former kingdom fled to Judah, bringing with them the tradition that Yahweh, already known in Judah, was not merely the most important of the gods, but the only god who should be served. This outlook was taken up by the Judahite landowning elite, who became extremely powerful in court circles in the next century when they placed the eight-year-old Josiah (reigned 641‚Äì609 BC) on the throne. During Josiah's reign Assyrian power suddenly collapsed, and a pro-independence movement took power promoting both the independence of Judah from foreign overlords and loyalty to Yahweh as the sole god of Israel. With Josiah's support the \\"Yahweh-alone\\" movement launched a full-scale reform of worship, including a covenant (i.e., treaty) between Judah and Yahweh, replacing that between Judah and Assyria. By the time this occurred, Yahweh had already been absorbing or superseding the positive characteristics of the other gods and goddesses of the pantheon, a process of appropriation that was an essential step in the subsequent emergence of one of Judaism's most notable features, its uncompromising monotheism. The people of ancient Israel and Judah, however, were not followers of Judaism: they were practitioners of a polytheistic culture worshiping multiple gods, concerned with fertility and local shrines and legends, and not with a written Torah, elaborate laws governing ritual purity, or an exclusive covenant and national god. Second Temple Judaism Model of the Second Temple showing the courtyards and the Sanctuary, as described in Middot. In 586 BCE Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians, and the Judean elite ‚Äì royal family, the priests, the scribes and other members of the elite ‚Äì were taken to Babylon in captivity. They represented only a minority of the population, and Judah, after recovering from the immediate impact of war, continued to have a life not much different from what had gone before. In 539 BCE Babylon fell to the Persians and the Babylonian exile ended and a number of the exiles, but by no means all and probably a minority, returned to Jerusalem. They were the descendants of the original exiles, and had never lived in Judah; nevertheless, in the view of the authors of the Biblical literature, they, and not those who had remained in the land, were \\"Israel\\". Judah, now called Yehud, was a Persian province, and the returnees, with their Persian connections in Babylon, were in control of it. They represented also the descendants of the old \\"Yahweh-alone\\" movement, but the religion they instituted was significantly different from both monarchic Yahwism and modern Judaism. These differences include new concepts of priesthood, a new focus on written law and thus on scripture, and a concern with preserving purity by prohibiting intermarriage outside the community of this new \\"Israel\\". The Yahweh-alone party returned to Jerusalem after the Persian conquest of Babylon and became the ruling elite of Yehud. Much of the Hebrew Bible was assembled, revised and edited by them in the 5th century BCE, including the Torah (the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy), the historical works, and much of the prophetic and Wisdom literature. The Bible narrates the discovery of a legal book in the Temple in the seventh century BCE, which the majority of scholars see as some form of Deuteronomy and regard as pivotal to the development of the scripture. The growing collection of scriptures was translated into Greek in the Hellenistic period by the Jews of the Egyptian diaspora, while the Babylonian Jews produced the court tales of the Book of Daniel (chapters 1‚Äì6 of Daniel ‚Äì chapters 7‚Äì12 were a later addition), and the books of Tobit and Esther. Other scholars contend that the development of a strict monotheism was the result of cultural diffusion between Persians and Hebrews. While (in practice) dualistic, Zoroastrianism believed in eschatological monotheism (i.e. only one god in the end). Some suggest that it is not merely coincidence that Zoroastrianism's model of eschatological monotheism and the Deuteronomic historians' strictly monotheistic model receive formative articulations during the period after Persia overthrew Babylon.http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/15283-zoroastrianism Second Temple Judaism was divided into theological factions, notably the Pharisees and the Sadducees, besides numerous smaller sects such as the Essenes, messianic movements such as Early Christianity, and closely related traditions such as Samaritanism (which gives us the Samaritan Pentateuch, an important witness of the text of the Torah independent of the Masoretic Text). During the 2nd to 1st centuries BCE, when Judea was under Seleucid and then Roman rule, the genre of apocalyptic literature became popular, the most notable work in this tradition being the Book of Daniel. Development of Rabbinic Judaism Scenes from the Book of Esther decorate the Dura-Europos synagogue dating from 244 CE For centuries, the traditional understanding has been that Judaism came before Christianity and that Christianity separated from Judaism some time after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. Starting in the latter half of the 20th century, some scholars have begun to argue that the historical picture is quite a bit more complicated than that. In the 1st century, many Jewish sects existed in competition with each other, see Second Temple Judaism. The sect of Israelite worship that eventually became Rabbinic Judaism and the sect which developed into Early Christianity were but two of these separate Israelite religious traditions. Thus, some scholars have begun to propose a model which envisions a twin birth of Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism, rather than an evolution and separation of Christianity from Rabbinic Judaism. It is increasingly accepted among scholars that \\"at the end of the 1st century CE there were not yet two separate religions called 'Judaism' and 'Christianity'\\". Daniel Boyarin (2002) proposes a revised understanding of the interactions between nascent Christianity and nascent Rabbinical Judaism in Late Antiquity which views the two religions as intensely and complexly intertwined throughout this period. The Amoraim were the Jewish scholars of Late Antiquity who codified and commented upon the law and the biblical texts. The final phase of redaction of the Talmud into its final form took place during the 6th century CE, by the scholars known as the Savoraim. This phase concludes the Chazal era foundational to Rabbinical Judaism.

Origins  Construction of the fort began in the summer of 1765, and took a couple of years to complete because of structural complications as well as the constant threat of attack by the Creek Native Americans. It was named for the reigning queen at the time. The Fort was made mostly of granite quarried from across the Savannah River. The Fort measured approximately 170 foot squared with bastions at every corner and a wall height of between 10 and 20 feet. The Fort was built for defensive purposes‚Äîto protect local settlers, as opposed to being a trading fort, meant for Native American/ European trading. Almost as soon as the Fort was completed the British Royal (Federal) government abandoned the Fort by placing it under the care and authority of the South Carolina government. During that time (1768) several forts were closed in the area, and in many cases guns, cannon, powder, bullets and other military supplies were sent to Fort Charlotte for safe keeping. These same supplies were later used by Patriot forces against Carolina Backcountry Tories and in at least one case these supplies found their way into a major battle‚Äîthe Second Siege of Fort Ninety-Six. At the same time the Fort was housing war supplies, the Patriots were meeting with leaders of the Cherokee at Fort Charlotte in an attempt to sway the Cherokee in their favor. The \\"good talks\\" however did not work and South Carolina entered the American Revolutionary War with the English and the Cherokee opposing them. Also worthy of note is that the Fort housed an undisclosed number of Prisoners-of-War. Exactly how many is unclear, but given the number of individuals loyal to the King that lived in the Carolina Backcountry, their numbers could have been numerous. The fate of the Fort after the Revolution is unclear, but certainly by the great flood, called the \\"Yazoo Freshet\\" of 1797, the standing walls would have been mostly leveled. This did not end the history of the Fort.  Post Revolutionary Period  After the Revolution the Fort became a popular spot for gentlemen to settle their differences via dueling. Several texts have referred to Fort Charlotte as \\"that popular old spot for dueling.\\" Evidence suggests that there were about 10 known duels there. The most famous of the duels to occur there was the Crawford-Van Alen duel, in which Van Alen was shot dead by future Georgia senator William H. Crawford. The grievance between Crawford and Van Alen was over land schemes which eventually culminated in the Supreme Court case Worcester v. Georgia. At the end of the Civil War, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and some of his cabinet fled through South Carolina into Georgia crossing the Savannah River at Fort Charlotte. Also with Davis was the Confederate seal and a substantial portion of the treasury. The treasury has yet to be found, but it is not beyond reason to think that perhaps the treasury was stashed at Fort Charlotte. An archaeological survey was conducted at the site in the 1950s, but, strangely, all of the artifacts were lost, and the official report was not released until after the death of the primary archaeologist. It was shortly thereafter that the lake was built and the site of Fort Charlotte flooded.

The castle was held by Royalist Sir William Darcy during the English Civil War.

Toshio Tamogami in August 2008 General is a Japanese Air Self-Defense Force career military officer. He served as the Chief of Staff of Japan's Air Self-Defense Force from March 2007 until October 2008. Tamogami turned to politics in 2014 as a candidate for governor of Tokyo and for the House of Representatives; he was arrested in April 2016 for alleged violations of campaign finance laws (illegal payments to supporters) in relation to his gubernatorial campaign. JASDF career Tamogami graduated from Fukushima Prefectural Asaka High School in 1967 and the National Defense Academy of Japan in 1971 with a major in electrical engineering. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1986, colonel in 1990, and major general in 1996. He was promoted to lieutenant general and appointed Head of the Joint Staff College on December 2, 2002, and appointed to Commander in Chief of the Air Defense Command on August 30, 2004. He was promoted to general and appointed Chief of Staff of the Air Self-Defense Force on March 28, 2007. A member of the openly revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi,\\"Japanese comfort- women deniers force White House response\\" -Foreign Policy - June 6, 2012 Tamogami gained attention in the press for a number of outspoken remarks in the latter days of his career. On the occasion of an unsuccessful civil case brought against the government for sending troops to Iraq, he remarked that he felt some of the activities of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force were against Japan's peace constitution, causing the litigants to claim a moral victory. On 14 July 2004, when questioned further about this supposed 'unconstitutionality' of the Air Self-Defense Force, he said that his opinion should not distress its members since (quoting the catch phrase of Yoshio Kojima, a popular comedian), \\"What does that matter?\\" At a semipolitical meeting on the 15 September 2004, he said that he felt that it would probably be necessary for Japan to develop nuclear arms in order to be seen as an independent nation by China and that promising never to develop nuclear arms is \\"foolish.\\" After the furor created by his essay and dismissal, he was asked, by a British journalist on 1 December 2008, whether he would have used nuclear arms against America in 1945; he responded he \\"might have considered using nuclear weapons against the United States had he been a general for a nuclear-capable Japan in 1945, especially if it was a case of nuking in response to the threat of American nuclear weapons.\\"Tamogami says he would nuke AmericaYoshida, Reiji, and Jun Hongo, \\"Tamogami ‚Äî history again retold\\", Japan Times, 11 November 2008, p. 2.

Roosevelt, who had allegedly been manipulated by the Comintern. The essay also argues that the war brought prosperity to occupied China, Taiwan and Korea, that \\"it is often those who never directly saw the Japanese military who are spreading rumors about the army's act of brutality\\", and that the Greater East Asia War is viewed in a positive way by many Asian countries. It criticizes the war crimes trials, which followed the war. Following the essay's publication, Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada removed Tamogami from the post and ordered him to retire since its viewpoint contradicted the government position and was likely to anger Japan's regional neighbors.Hongo, Jun, \\"New ASDF chief Hokazono sorry for Tamogami's 'damaging' essay\\", Japan Times, 8 November 2008, p. 1.Hongo, Jun, \\"Tamogami's cohorts reprimanded\\", Japan Times, 26 December 2008.

He had already written a similar essay in May 2007 for an ASDF internal publication. On 13 November, prime minister Tar≈ç As≈ç said Tamogami decision's to write this essay was \\"extremely inappropriate\\" and the government was wrong in having overlooked Tamogami's views for many years.Tamogami says he would nuke AmericaHongo, Jun, \\"Tamogami views no secret\\", Japan Times, 20 November 2008, p. 3. The essay that led to Tamogami's dismissal had been solicited for a writing contest organized and sponsored by his friend, prominent businessman and nationalist Toshio Motoya, under the theme \\"True Interpretation of Modern History.\\" Motoya and the other judges, including Shoichi Watabe, an honorary professor at Sophia University, awarded Tamogami the competition's ¬•3 million first prize. The piece later appeared in a book published by Motoya, \\"The Shocking Truth About Modern History,\\" which also featured other essays entered in the competition. Tamogami was demoted to lieutenant general upon removal from his position as chief of staff on October 31. He retired from the JASDF on November 3, 2008, having reached the mandatory retirement age for his lower rank. Political career Since retiring from the Air Self-Defense Force, General Tamogami has become involved with Japanese nationalist groups, heading Ganbare Nippon at its founding in February 2010. He also wrote a column for the magazine Asahi Geino, in which he opined on topics such as the Chinese and North Korean military threats and the benefits of corporal punishment. In a 2011 book, he spelled out a more independent defense policy for Japan under which Japan would have the right to collective self-defense and would acquire nuclear weapons, aircraft carriers, bombers and cruise missiles, as well as enhancing its amphibious troops and intelligence-gathering capabilities. He organized a rally to protest the Senkaku Islands incident where a Chinese fishing trawler collided with two Japanese Coast Guard patrol boats. At the anti-China rally, he said: \\"Senkaku Islands is Japan's traditional territory, if we don't protect it, China will make action to take it.\\" In August 2012, he helped lead a group of Japanese activists to the Senkaku Islands to protest a landing on the islands days earlier by Chinese activists.Meyers, Chris, Reuters, \\"Landings, protests stoke Japan-China islands dispute\\", Yahoo! News, 20 August 2012 In the wake of a rape incident by American servicemen in Okinawa in October 2012, he pointed out in a Twitter post that both recent rape incidents had occurred around 4 am, and asked why the media had not questioned what the victims were doing walking around town at that time. He announced his candidacy for governor of Tokyo in 2014 in the election to replace resigning governor Naoki Inose. Although Tamogami obtained 610,865 votes, he lost to former Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare Y≈çichi Masuzoe, who obtained more than 2.1 million votes.

AI-2 is one of only a few known biomolecules incorporating boron. First identified in the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi, AI-2 is produced and recognized by many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. AI-2 arises by the reaction of 1-deoxy-3-dehydro-D-ribulose, which is produced enzymatically with boric acid,http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/reaction/misc/AI2.html and is recognized by the two-component sensor kinase LuxPQ in Vibrionaceae. AI-2 is actively transported by the Lsr ABC-type transporter into the cell in Enterobacteriaceae and few other bacterial taxa (Pasteurella, Photorhabdus, Haemophilus, Bacillus), where it is phosphorylated by LsrK. Then, Phospho-AI-2 binds the transcriptional repressor protein, LsrR, which subsequently is released from the promoter/operator region of the lsr operon ‚Äì and transcription of the lsr genes is initiated. AI-2 signalling is also regulated by glucose and cAMP/CRP via the lsr operon. In the presence of glucose, low levels of cAMP/CRP result in almost no lsr operon (lsrABCDFG) expression. Without glucose, cAMP-CRP is needed to stimulate the lsr expression, while LsrR represses its expression in the absence of the inducer, phospho-AI-2. As AI-2 accumulates, more AI-2 is taken in via LsrABCD, phosphorylated via LsrK, and the lsr transcription is de-repressed, enabling even more AI-2 uptake. Doubts have been expressed regarding AI-2's status as a universal signal. Although the luxS gene, which encodes the protein responsible for AI-2 production is widespread, the latter has mainly a primary metabolic role in the recycling of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, with AI-2 being a by-product of that process. An unequivocally AI-2 related behavior was found to be restricted primarily to organisms bearing known AI-2 receptor genes. Thus, while it is certainly true that some bacteria respond to AI-2, it is doubtful that it is always being produced for purposes of signaling.

Although a road leads to the pass from Sion and goes further to the Lac de Sanetsch, it can not be completely traversed by car. In the summer season the pass is accessible by PostBus and can also be traversed by cable car. The highest point of the road is at 2,252 metres. The pass itself is located in Valais 4 km south of the border with Berne. It separates the massif of the Diablerets on the west from the massif of the Wildhorn on the east. The Sanetschhorn and the Arpelistock overlook the pass on the west and east side respectively. The Col du Sanetsch is a popular destination because of the view over the Pennine Alps and the nearby Tsanfleuron Glacier.

The film is distributed by Roadside Attractions. The film exhibits significant thematic and plot similarities to Abbas Kiarostami's 1997 film Taste of Cherry. Plot Solo, a Senegalese cab driver, is working to provide a better life for his young family in Winston- Salem, North Carolina. William, an old man with a lifetime of regrets, hires Solo to take him to Blowing Rock, a peak in which updrafts cause objects that are dropped from it to fly upwards. William does not ask for a ride back from the rock and is obviously depressed, so Solo assumes that the old man intends to commit suicide there. Solo befriends William, in hopes of talking him out of ending his life. He introduces William to his wife and his stepdaughter Alex, hoping to inspire the old man with the joys of life.

Weeden (1786) was a Rhode Island Supreme Court decision finding state legislation regarding paper currency was violative of the state constitution. The decision set precedent for Marbury v. Madison regarding judicial review. History On September 25‚Äì26, 1786, the Superior Court of Judicature of Rhode Island (Rhode Island Supreme Court) heard the case in Newport, Rhode Island with a decision by David Howell. In May 1786, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed legislation allowing paper money as legal tender, and in June 1786 the Court created penalties for anyone refusing to accept such currency. In August 1786, the Assembly passed further legislation providing that trial of offenders should take place \\"without any jury,\\" by a majority of the judges and no appeal was allowed. Both common law and the Constitution of Rhode Island guaranteed a jury trial in contrast to the legislation. Power of Federal Judiciary Over Legislation by John Hampden Dougherty (Putnam, 1912) pg. 28-32 General James M. Varnum, a U.S. Congressman representing the defendant argued that although the American Revolution occurred, the original colonial Constitution was still valid and the assembly derived its powers from this document. Accordingly, the Court retained the power to judge the constitutionality of any legislation under the Constitution. The Court found that the paper currency law was unconstitutional (\\"not cognizable\\") because it limited the right to a jury trial for violators.Power of Federal Judiciary Over Legislation by John Hampden Dougherty (Putnam, 1912) pg. 28-32 Aftermath After the decision, the justices were brought before the General Assembly, reprimanded, and all but one were not reappointed for the following term.

The film explores satires of Angeleno stereotypes, which are told through five interlacing stories. The five intertwining segments are based on popular stereotypes of West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks, Westwood and Holmby Hills. Each of the characters in the film confronts taboos and an uncertain, often darkly humorous, fate. Producer Oren Segal likens the film to \\"a John Waters version of Short Cuts, a 1993 drama film directed by Robert Altman. The film was released in the United States on January 14, 2011, by New Films International. It received mixed reviews from critics. Plot ; The Green-Eyed Monster Dedra Davenport (Rosamund Pike) meets Chloe, the 15-year-old daughter (Emily Meade) of her fianc√© Dennis (Dylan McDermott) for the very first time. However, she is soon disturbed by how close father and daughter are, committing suicide by cutting her veins just like Chloe's mother, feeling herself shut out and betrayed by the unhealthy close and bordering on incestuous relationship between the two. ; This Little Piggy Ginny Bai (Jamie Chung) agrees to participate in an unconventional sex act with her boyfriend Chad Bower (Robert Hoffman). Soon after she begins to slowly lose her mind when she cannot seem to get rid of an odd smell from her finger. ; Buyer's Remorse A rich and well-recognized West Hollywood gay couple (Peter Macdissi and Anson Mount) decide to adopt a seven-year-old African girl (Tiara McKinney). They prove to be mentally unprepared for the challenges and risks involved in parenthood, especially since she is a decided mute who refuses to speak to them, and abandon her. ; Kangaroo Court A group of bullying, bratty boys, cared for by an irresponsible nanny (Lake Bell) are puzzled by their maid (Paz Vega) keeping the umbilical cord of her dead child and eventually discover that the maid murdered her own child to punish her boyfriend for infidelity. ; Maneater An unidentified man (Nick Stahl) breaks into the apartment of meek woman Sarah Cotton (Zoe Saldana), and rapes her. Sometime later she finds the man's wallet and is able to track him down and approaches him, wanting him to rape her again.

The film was shot in Los Angeles, California and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Oren Segal, Steven Prince and Jason Hewitt produced the film, and Tyler Thompson, Vince Morella and Naz Jafri were executive producers. Reception To date, the critical reception for the film has been largely negative. One critic described the film as being \\"one of the most offensive movies I‚Äôve seen in the past decade\\", going on to say: Andrew Schenker of Slant magazine gave the film just half of one star out of a possible four.

The cover of the sleeve is mainly occupied by the same photo from the cover of Early Days. It features the members of Led Zeppelin in late Apollo mission astronaut suits in front of a starry background and a Led Zeppelin logo. The logo behind them shows many space-related images, but the only one wholly visible is the image of the moon's face with a space capsule stuck in its eye taken from the early silent movie A Trip to the Moon. On the back of the sleeve is an array of information split up into two columns. On the left column, there is a photograph of the cover of Latter Days.

In the logo is an image of Saturn and behind all of the foreground is an image of Earth taken from space. Below that is the information about Atlantic. On the right column is a synopsis of the tracks on both discs. Early Days disc Early Days is packaged in a plastic jewel compact disc case. Much of the background is a drawing of stars, yet inside the case and behind the CD is an image of an artist's rendition of a supernova, apparently airbrushed. On the backside of the case is a list of the tracks. The background of the back cover appears to be a slightly out-of-focus photograph, likely taken by an amateur photographer. The Early Days liner notes begin with the cover. On the cover is the same image that appears on the foreground of the sleeve. Inside the booklet is first a summary of the tracks, and then photos of the band ranging from 1969 to 1973.

Latter Days disc The packaging for Latter Days mirrors that of Early Days. The four band members are pictured in the same Apollo space suits in the same order, but they are older. Much of the background is of Earth as viewed from orbit. There is a picture of Saturn in place of the picture of the moon with the ship in its eye. Behind the CD is an image of the Eagle Nebula. The liner notes are just like those of Early Days, except for the fact that the images range from the years 1972 to 1979. =Enhanced CD= Both the Early Days CD and the Latter Days CD are enhanced so they can play extra content on a computer.

He was the second son of Palamede Gattilusio.  History  Upon his father's death, Dorino seized all of his father's properties as his own, despite the rights of his older brother's widow and children by primogeniture. The widow attempted a peaceful resolution, but when Dorino refused to negotiate she sent her uncle to petition the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II for help. This, along with complaints from the Turkish judges of Ipsala and Ferrai (Ferecik) induced the Sultan to take action: 24 January 1456 he led an army by land on the city while his admiral Yunus Pasha established a blockade with a squadron of 10 ships. At the time Dorino was absent from Ainos, wintering on Samothrace. Without their master, the inhabitants of Ainos negotiated their surrender to the Sultan. After accepting the surrender of Ainos, Mehmed II then sent Yunus Pasha to seize Samothrace and Imbros; the admiral appointed the historian Kritobulos governor of Imros. At the same time Yunus Pasha sent a ship to take Dorino into custody; suspicious of the admiral, Dorino preferred to travel to the Sultan by his own means, first sending his daughter with lavish gifts ahead. Sultan Mehmed inclined to returning the two island to Dorino until he learned from Yunus Pasha the discontent of Dorino's subjects. Instead Mehmed II granted Dorino an estate far from the sea, at Ziche in Macedonia. Dorino was unhappy with his new residence, and after picking a quarrel with his Ottoman \\"guard of honor\\" he massacred them and fled Ziche. First he settled in Lesbos, then moved to Naxos which he made his permanent home.  Personal life  Dorino married in 1454 his cousin Elisabetta Crispo (born 1445), daughter of Giacomo II Crispo, thirteenth Duke of the Archipelago, and wife Ginevra Gattilusio. They had no children.

ISAW's mission is to cultivate comparative, connective investigations of the ancient world from the western Mediterranean to China. Areas of specialty among ISAW's faculty include the Greco-Roman world, the Ancient Near East, Egypt, Central Asia and the Silk Road, East Asian art and archaeology, Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages, ancient science, and digital humanities. ISAW was founded in 2006 with funding from the Leon Levy Foundation, established to continue the philanthropic legacy of Leon Levy, co-founder of the Oppenheimer mutual funds. Long interested in ancient history, Levy in his final years, along with his wife Shelby White, began discussions about the creation of a path-breaking institute where advanced scholars would explore trade and cultural links among ancient civilizations. After Levy‚Äôs death in 2003, one of the earliest initiatives of the Leon Levy Foundation, was the fulfillment of that plan. ISAW is a discrete entity within New York University, independent of any other school or department of the university, with its own endowment and its own board of trustees, and is housed in separate facilities in a historic six-story limestone on East 84th Street in Manhattan. Governance, faculty, and staff The Director of ISAW is Alexander Jones (classicist). He succeeded the founding director Roger Bagnall in September, 2016. As of September 1, 2018, the following individuals served as ISAW faculty: * Lorenzo d'Alfonso * Claire Bubb * Roderick B. Campbell * Sebastian Heath * Robert G. Hoyland * Alexander Jones *Antonis Kotsonas * Beate Pongratz-Leisten * Daniel T. Potts * S√∂ren Stark * Lillian Lan-ying Tseng As of September 1, 2018, Senior Staff Members included: * Diane Bennett (Associate Director for Administration) * Tom Elliott (Associate Director for Digital Programs and Senior Research Scholar) * Clare Fitzgerald (Associate Director for Exhibitions and Gallery Curator) * Marc LeBlanc (Assistant Director for Academic Affairs) * David M. Ratzan (Head, ISAW Library) ISAW's website describes its governance structure as follows: Appointments and academic programs of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World are under the jurisdiction of its faculty, which achieved independent status in fall, 2010, and which is led by the Director. The Director reports to the Provost and President of New York University. In addition, the Institute has its own Director's Council. Its chair is the Institute's Founder, Shelby White. The Council plays a crucial role in ensuring that ISAW fulfills its mission and has the means necessary to do so. It provides essential advice to the Director on strategic directions and public programming, and its members are vital ambassadors for ISAW in enlarging the public reached by its work. Academic programs ISAW's graduate program offers a PhD in the Study of the Ancient World. ISAW offers hosts visiting research scholars conducting postdoctoral research. There are three types of appointment for visiting scholars: * Visiting assistant professors, appointed for two years, during which they are expected to teach two undergraduate courses and one graduate seminar. * Visiting research scholars, appointed for one year of research, funded in part or in whole by ISAW. These scholars may be at any point in their career from postdoctoral to retired. * Externally funded scholars, who have the same responsibilities and privileges as the categories above, but do not receive financial support from ISAW. Scholars in all three categories are expected to be in residence at ISAW for the duration of their appointment and to participate in the intellectual life of the community, including presenting a public lecture. Exhibitions In order to support its mission of communicating information about antiquity to the public, ISAW organizes public exhibitions. Past exhibitions include: * Wine, Worship and Sacrifice: The Golden Graves of Ancient Vani (March 12 ‚Äì June 1, 2008) * The Lost World of Old Europe: The Danube Valley, 5000 ‚Äì 3500 BC (November 11, 2009 ‚Äì April 25, 2010) Reviewed by John Noble Wilford: \\"A Lost European Culture, Pulled From Obscurity\\", The New York Times, Published: November 30, 2009. * Before Pythagoras: The Culture of Old Babylonian Mathematics (November 12, 2010 ‚Äì January 23, 2011) * Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa (March 11 ‚Äì June 12, 2011) * Edge of Empires: Pagans, Jews, and Christians at Roman Dura-Europos (September 23, 2011 ‚Äì January 8, 2012) * Nomads and Networks: The Ancient Art and Culture of Kazakhstan (March 7 ‚Äì June 3, 2012) * Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan (September 11, 2012 ‚Äì January 6, 2013) * Temple and Tomb: Prehistoric Malta, 3600‚Äì2500 BCE (March 21 ‚Äì July 7, 2013) * Measuring and Mapping Space: Geographic Knowledge in Greco-Roman Antiquity (October 4, 2013 ‚Äì January 5, 2014) * Masters of Fire: Copper Age Art from Israel (February 13, 2014 ‚Äì June 8, 2014) * When the Greeks Ruled Egypt: From Alexander the Great to Cleopatra (October 8, 2014 ‚Äì January 4, 2015) * From Ancient to Modern: Archaeology and Aesthetics (February 12, 2015 ‚Äì June 7, 2015) * The Eye of the Shah: Qajar Court Photography and the Persian Past (October 22, 2015 ‚Äì January 17, 2016) * Designing Identity: The Power of Textiles in Late Antiquity (February 25 ‚Äì May 22, 2016) * Time and Cosmos in Greco-Roman Antiquity (October 19, 2016 ‚Äì April 23, 2017) * ...circle through New York (March 1 ‚Äì August 31, 2017) * Restoring the Minoans: Elizabeth Price and Sir Arthur Evans (October 5, 2017 ‚Äì January 7, 2018) * Romance and Reason: Islamic Transformations of the Classical Past (February 14, 2018 ‚Äì May 13, 2018) *Devotion and Decadence: The Berthouville Treausure and Roman Luxury (October 17, 2018 - January 6, 2019) * Encyclopedia of Society and Culture in the Ancient World * History books pdf Most exhibitions have been accompanied by illustrated catalogs, many of which are co-published by ISAW and Princeton University Press. Library ISAW houses a research library of approximately 40,000 non-circulating print volumes. The ISAW Library is a branch library of the NYU Division of Libraries, with facilities located on four floors of ISAW's facilities on East 84th Street. The library is open to members of the ISAW and NYU communities, as well as to scholars from other institutions who can demonstrate a need to access materials in the collection for their research. Particular areas of strength in the ISAW Library's print collection include Greek and Roman material culture and history, Papyrology, Egyptology, Mesopotamian Archaeology and Assyriology, Central Asia and Iran, and Early China. The library is engaged in providing access and support for new and emerging forms of digital scholarship, scholarly communication, and pedagogy in ancient studies. The library's digital initiatives include the Ancient World Digital Library (AWDL) and a joint project with ISAW Digital Programs to help catalog the online and open access resources.

There were four sub- classes: the S 10, S 10.1 (with 1911 and 1914 variants) and S 10.2. Prussian S 10 As a result of the lack of powerful express locomotives in the first decade of the 20th century, the Prussian state railways ordered the Class S 10 locomotives from Schwartzkopff. This engine was an evolutionary development of the passenger train locomotive, the Prussian P 8, which can be seen from the similarity in their locomotive frames. Unlike the P 8, however, the S 10‚Äîinspired by the Saxon XII H‚Äîhad a four-cylinder engine with simple expansion. Between 1910 and 1914 a total of 202 locomotives were built. The two prototypes were initially designated as S 8 class and only reclassified in 1912 to S 10. The L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway took delivery of five similar, albeit somewhat less powerful, machines that they also designated as the S 10. Over the course of time several modifications were made. In the end the S 10 proved to be worse than the S 101, a four-cylinder compound locomotive in terms of both steam and coal consumption and was one of the most uneconomical Prussian locomotives. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over 135 locomotives into its Class 17.0-1 and gave them the running numbers 17 001‚Äì135. They were retired by 1935, however, due to their high fuel consumption. Only three examples (17 039, 102 and 107) survived the Second World War, as braking locomotives. The last S 10 was retired in 1954. Number 17 008 has been sectioned and is on display in the German Museum of Technology in Berlin . The S 10s were coupled with tenders of classes pr 2'2' T 21.5 and pr 2'2' T 31.5. Prussian S 10.1 (1911 variant) Even as production started on the S 10, Henschel were given an order for the manufacture of a compound locomotive, which promised to deliver lower coal consumption. This locomotive, classified as the S 10.1, was not based on the S 10, but was a new design. The four-cylinder compound engine was of the de Glehn type, which meant that the outside cylinders, set well to the rear, drove the second coupled axle and the inside cylinder drove the first. The engines were larger and more powerful than the S 10 and, thanks to their compound engines, also more economical. Between 1911 and 1914, no less than 135 examples were built for Prussia and 17 for Alsace-Lorraine. Following initial dissatisfaction with the vehicles, several modifications to the locomotives finally led to the desired success. For example, no feedwater preheater was fitted to start with for weight-saving reasons, but one was later installed. The remaining disadvantages, such as the poor accessibility of the inside drive, led to the development of a new version in the shape of the 1914 variant. After three locomotives were sent abroad as reparations, the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the remaining 132 vehicles as Class 17.10‚Äì11 with numbers 17 1001‚Äì1123 and 17 1145‚Äì1153. The three locomotives left in 1945 with the Austrian Federal Railway were renumbered to 617.1004, 617.1089 and 617.1099 and retired in 1957. The Deutsche Bundesbahn withdrew their last S 10.1 engines in 1952. The Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany held onto these locomotives for longer and converted 13 examples to coal-dust firing. Locomotive number 17 1119 was given a condensing tender. In 1963 the last machines were taken out of service by the DR. Number 17 1055 (formerly \\"Posen 1107\\", running as \\"Osten 1135\\") was partly returned to its original configuration and belongs today to the Dresden Transport Museum. The S 10.1s were equipped with tenders of Prussian classes pr 2'2' T 21.5 and pr 2'2' T 31.5. Prussian S 10.1 (1914 variant) Various disadvantages of the 1911 variant of the S 10.1, such as the difficulty of accessing the inside driving gear and the long steam lines between high and low-pressure cylinders, caused the Prussian state railways to have the design reworked. The four cylinders were now located ‚Äì as on the von Borries compound ‚Äì on a slant; the twin-axle drive configuration was however retained. Even the boiler was modified; grate and firebox heating areas and the superheater were increased in size. Due to the altered location of the cylinders the running plate could be raised, which gave the locomotives a higher and more modern appearance, although in fact the height of the boiler axis above the rails remained unchanged. In spite of these considerable differences, the 1914 variant was also designated as the S 10.1. These locomotives were the most powerful expresses in Prussia, and the Prussian state railways continued to live without Pacific locomotives. In 1914, one locomotive reached a speed of 152 km/h on a trial run with three coaches (according to some sources it may even have reached 156 km/h). The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over 77 locomotives as Class 17.11-12 with the numbers 17 1124‚Äì1144 and 1154‚Äì1209. In the DR in the GDR two 1914 variant locomotives were given Wendler coal-dust firing. The last engine was retired in 1964. Unlike the 1911 variant, no 1914 variant of this locomotive class remains preserved. Prussian S 10.2 The Stettiner Maschinenbau AG Vulcan built the Class S 10.2 based on the S 10. In contrast to the S 10 it only had three cylinders, but was otherwise largely identical. The Prussian state railways bought a total of 124 locomotives from 1914. These variants were certainly superior to the S 10, but not the S 10.1. 28 engines had to be handed to foreign railway administrations after the First World War. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the remaining 96 vehicles, incorporating them into Class 17.2 with running numbers 17 201‚Äì296. The remaining engines were gathered together into the northern and central German Reichsbahn railway divisions. Here they were partly replaced from 1930 by the Class 03. 88 engines survived the Second World War and ended up with the Deutsche Bundesbahn, where they were retired by 1948. The S 10.2s were equipped with pr 2'2' T 31.5 tenders. Trial locomotives Three S 10.2s were fitted with Stumpf parallel-flow cylinders (Gleichstromzylinder) for test purposes, whereby unlike the production models, the outer cylinders drove the second coupled axle. Even when they were converted to the standard configuration, the twin-axle drive was retained. One of these engines went to Poland after the First World War; the others were given numbers 17 203 and 17 204 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. In 1925, locomotive 17 206 was given a Schmidt-Hartmann high-pressure boiler with a boiler overpressure of 5.884 MPa (58.84 bar), and the drive was converted to a compound configuration. The increased performance of the H 17 206 designated locomotive compared with the production design did not justify the higher construction costs however; the engine was converted back to the standard design in 1929 and retired in 1936. The two locomotives with running numbers 17 236 and 17 239 were given a medium-pressure boiler in 1933 with a boiler overpressure of 2.452 MPa (24.52 bar), and they were also converted to compound operation at the same time. The performance of these converted engines matched that of the DRG Class 03 and they were employed together with the Class 03s in scheduled services. After several cases of boiler damage, however the boiler pressure, had to be reduced to 16 bar (1.6 MPa) in order to avoid further problems. During the 1930s the two medium- pressure locomotives were reconverted again. Both engines survived the ware and were retired together with the other S 10.2s in 1948.

This extra thinking time forces people to register the real brand. This method can be more effective than product placement.Hungry Beast: Product DISplacement Method Product displacement is usually achieved via digital pixelation, though prior to the widespread availability of computer post-production, stagehands would cover up brands on bottles, etc., using tape, or by using fake labels. This was called \\"greeking\\" and the term is also used now for the digital process as well. Types There are two types of product displacements within the industry, which are identified as fictionalized and unbranded product displacements. =Fictionalized product displacement= Fictionalized product displacement is often used by directors or production staff to use a completely fictional brand and/or product which closely resembles and mimics a non-fictional product or brand. This is often done, so the viewers can make close correlation with an already existing non-fictional brand that they may use on a daily basis without having to create another fictional dimension for a separate product altogether. Some of the most popular TV series over the past decade have used this technique to allow their viewers to make that clear distinction, especially shows such as Scrubs where the protagonists are often seen mingling at a coffee shop known as \\"Coffee Bucks\\" which closely resembles the logo, colour and theme of a Starbucks. Similarly other TV shows such as My Name Is Earl also used similar technique with the fictional candy bar by the name of TitTat Candy, which closely resembles the Kit Kat chocolate bar, offered by The Hershey Company.http://www.murketing.com/journal/?p=3254 =Unbranded product displacement= Unbranded product displacement is used when a marketer makes a known effort to hide or pixelate the logo of non-fictional company or product within a specific advertisement, TV show, or movie. Within unbranded product displacement there are two different ways that can be used to hide or pixelate a non-fictional product or brand. Either through \\"digital alternation\\" where the brand is pixelated, erased, and or hid digitally, or through physical removal of a brand, such as removing the logo of a car from its front grill.http://gladyssantiago.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/product-displacements- explained-part-1/ Other notable examples Dale Earnhardt, Jr.'s #8 Chevrolet Monte Carlo appeared in Pixar animated film Cars with all beer advertising removed A TV or film studio does not need permission from a company to display or mention its products or service in media form. Warner Bros. Television's The Big Bang Theory used a restaurant of The Cheesecake Factory as a setting without any formal arrangement with the chain. According to Danny Boyle, director of 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire, the makers had to resort to \\"product displacement\\" when companies such as Mercedes refused to allow their products to be used in non-flattering settings. They objected to their products being shown in a slum setting. This forced the makers in post- production to remove logos digitally, costing \\"tens of thousands of pounds\\".The Times The practice of product displacement is also frequently seen on reality television programs which do not have clearance to display the logos or products of non-sponsor companies. This accounts for the frequent appearance of pixel mosaics and blurring of logo T-shirts, soda cans or bottles, and other instances on shows such as America's Next Top Model, Survivor, Dr. Phil, and The Real World.

Based in Sudbury, Ontario, the company operates radio stations and newspapers in the Northeastern Ontario region. The company operates the only francophone commercial radio stations in Ontario which originate their own programming; with the exception of one station in Eastern Ontario which primarily rebroadcasts a station from Montreal with only a few hours per week of original programming, all other francophone stations in the province are public or community radio stations operated by non-profit groups or Radio-Canada. Owned and operated by Paul Lefebvre, at the time a lawyer with the Sudbury firm of Weaver, Simmons, the company was incorporated in 2008 after Lefebvre reached a deal with Haliburton Broadcasting Group to acquire the company's francophone radio stations in Sudbury and Timmins for $425,000.Broadcast Dialogue , May 29, 2008.

If the numeral 5 is pronounced as in English (i.e. \\"five\\" rather than \\"cinq\\"), the company's name is very close to the French pronunciation of Lefebvre. History Although originally established by separate owners in the 1950s, CHYC-FM in Sudbury and CHYK-FM in Timmins had been under common ownership since their acquisition by Mid-Canada Radio in 1985. The stations were acquired by the Pelmorex Radio Network in 1990, and subsequently by Haliburton in 1999, before Le5 acquired the stations in 2008. On August 4, 2010, Le5 Communications applied to operate a new French-language FM radio station in West Nipissing, operating at 97.1 MHz with an adult pop-music format.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2010-551 The company received approval to operate the new station on January 6, 2011.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-2 On March 28, 2015, Lefebvre was chosen as the Liberal Party of Canada's candidate for the Sudbury riding in the 2015 federal election.\\"Sudbury Liberals choose Paul Lefebvre as their federal election candidate\\".

Holdings =Radio= * Sudbury - CHYC-FM * Timmins - CHYK-FM * West Nipissing/North Bay - CHYQ-FM All three stations are branded as Le Loup, and air common programming for the most part. Each station formerly produced its own distinct morning show, but for the remainder of the day each station was the host studio to at least one daypart within a shared region-wide simulcast, though the three stations aired separate identifications and commercials. Programming has since been centralized so that all three stations now broadcast virtually identical programming at all times, predominantly produced in Sudbury except for some syndicated programming; as of 2020, the only locally targeted programming that remains separate on the three stations is local weather updates. The Timmins station formerly operated rebroadcasters in Kapuskasing and Hearst, which were decommissioned in 2016, and a community group holds a separate license to rebroadcast the Sudbury station in Chapleau. =Newspapers= The company launched L'Express de Timmins, a weekly francophone community newspaper in Timmins, in 2010.

Its name is coincidentally identical to a univerbation based on the Slovene word sneg 'snow', but is actually a Slovenized form of the name of the noble house of Schneberg, whose possession it initially was. The Schnebergs were followed by the houses of Lamberg, Eggenberg, Lichtenberg, and Sch√∂nburg- Waldenburg. History The date of the castle's construction is unclear; its existence is first implied in 1269, by way of mention of its owner Meinhard von Schneberg (, ). The castle itself was first mentioned in 1461, as the manor of Sneberk; at the time it was a possession of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, with the Schnebergs as their ministeriales. The family fractured the estate through multiple heirs; by the late 14th century the castle had several co-owners. In 1393, a quarter-share of it and several neighboring farms was purchased by William II von Lamberg, a relative of the Schnebergs; his descendants increased their share through the 15th century until they owned the entire estate, giving the castle its more-or-less current renaissance appearance as well. By marriages, the castle passed to the Scheyer family, followed by the Pranckhs and, in the first third of the 17th century, the barons Rambschissl, who sold it to the Imperial governor of Carniola, prince Eggenberg. Along with Sne≈ænik, the prince bought the lordship of Lo≈æ, moving its administrative center from the uncomfortable, hilltop Lo≈æ Castle to the more amiable and better-accessible manor at Sne≈ænik. In 1669, Janez ≈Ωiga Eggenberg sold the Lo≈°-Sne≈ænik lordship to prince Janez Vajkard Auersperg, the count of Gottschee (Koƒçevje). in 1707 the estate was taken over by count Jurij Gotfrid Lichtenberg, who in 1718 permanently joined the Lo≈æ and Sne≈ænik lordships. The house of Lichtenberg held the estate for 140 years, a period marked by the centralist policies of the Habsburg monarchy, in particular the constant diminution of the rights of the nobility. By the early 19th century, the Lichtenberg had been forced deep into hock; a court-ordered appraisal occurred in 1816. In 1832 the family was forced to accept a lottery loan; the main prize was the entire Sne≈ænik estate, or 250,000 florins. The lucky winner, a Hungarian blacksmith, took the cash, while the Lichtenbergs went on to sell the estate in 1847 to a Viennese couple named Karis, who went bankrupt shortly thereafter. The estate was purchased at auction in 1853 for 800,000 florins by the German prince Oton Viktor Schoenburg-Waldenburg. Prince Jurij, the third son of Oton Viktor, inherited the castle in 1859 and heavily remodeled it for use as a summer home and hunting lodge. In addition to adding a story, two turrets, a terrace, and elevating the defensive walls, he also richly furnished the interior and established a surrounding English-style park. Wishing to preserve the estate for his heirs, the prince established a fideicommiss about the property. Stocking the woods with deer and the ponds with trout, he ordered several paths built through the forest, he also hired experts to maintain the surrounding wilderness, and was the patron of the first Slovene forestry school, opened in the castle in 1869 but closed in 1875 due to germanophone political pressure. The princes' construction of a steam sawmill began the industrial development of the Lo≈æ Valley. In 1902 prince Jurij was succeeded by his firstborn, Herman, a diplomat. After World War I the estate was divided between Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by the Treaty of Rapallo. Prince Herman died in 1943 at the family castle of Hermsdorf by Dresden. During World War II the castle caretaker faithfully guarded the estate, repelling looters; as a consequence, the interior furnishing of the Schoenburgs survive intact. In 1945, the castle and estate were nationalized, and became a hunting lodge reserved for important state functionaries. In 1983, the castle was opened to the public as a museum. Architecture Grave markers looted from the ruins of an ancient Roman outpost in ≈†marata were incorporated into the castle's facade. The four- story building is surrounded by a renaissance-era wall. The castle was heavily remodeled in the second half of the 19th century; the majority of the interior furnishings date from this period, as do the castle parkgrounds, which are characterized by numerous meadows connected by riding and walking paths, bordered with numerous chestnut and linden tree rows, and which contain two small artificial lakes filled by Obrh and Brezno creeks. An engraving in Valvasor's 1689 The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola depicts Sne≈ænik (as \\"Schneeperg\\"); while of generally similar appearance and layout as today, the twin round and diagonally square corner turrets guarding the main gate were then smaller, square wooden watchtowers. The engraving also shows the castle's defensive ditch had not yet been flooded and was traversed by a simple wooden bridge had instead of a multi-arched stone one.

Headquartered in Monticello, New York, Empire Resorts is 88.7% owned by Kien Huat Realty Sdn Bhd of Genting Group. Empire Resorts is currently developing the five-star Resorts World Catskills, a US$1.5 billion 1700 acre resort currently under construction on the site of the former Concord Resort Hotel in New York State‚Äôs Catskill Mountains. History Empire Resorts was founded in 2003 through a consolidation of Alpha Hospitality and Catskill Development LLC, a company that had purchased the Monticello Raceway in 1996. The consolidation was carried out by Robert A. Berman, who in the previous year had been offered control as CEO of Alpha Hospitality by Stanley Tollman. In 2003, Berman restructured Alpha Hospitality after principal shareholders of the Bryanston Group (Alpha Hopitality‚Äôs controlling shareholder) were indicted on tax-related charges. Berman restored financial stability by selling off non-essential gaming assets and merging the company with Catskill Development LLC, which led to the creation of Empire Resorts that same year. During this time Berman also arranged for Empire Resorts to sell common stock through Jefferies Group. This resulted in Empire Resorts receiving over $35 million in new funding. In 2003 Empire Resorts became a NASDAQ Global Market company, trading under the ticker symbol \\"NYNY.\\" In 2004 Empire Resorts entered into an agreement to purchase the Concord Resort Hotel from Louis R. Cappelli. The transaction was later modified by Kien Huat Realty, which gave way to the $1.5 billion resort project currently financed and under construction by Empire Resorts. The project is located on the site of Adelaar, a resort developed by Entertainment Properties Trust within the Concord Resort Hotel. The entertainment complex will include an 80,000 sq. ft. casino, multiple hotel properties, waterparks, and a retail village, dining and entertainment areas. The project is expected to be concluded by 2018. In 2009, Kien Huat Realty invested a further $55 million in new equity capital, which represented just below 50% of the voting power of Empire Resorts. Kien Huat is an investment branch of the Genting Group, a large leisure and gambling conglomerate founded by Malaysian entrepreneur Lim Goh Tong. Kien Huat, which had previously financed the startup of Foxwoods Resort Casino and the Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel in New York, was fronted by CEO Lim Kok Thay (Lim Goh Tong‚Äôs son). In 2010 the Genting Group won a bid to build a racino similar to what it owned in Monticello at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York City. In December 2015, Empire Resorts received a full gaming license for Montreign Resort Casino in New York. On February 2016, Kien Huat Realty purchased $290 million worth of shares, giving the firm 88.7% ownership of Empire Resorts. Empire Resorts currently owns and manages several subsidiaries in the hospitality and gaming industries. The company owns and operates Monticello Raceway and casino in New York through its subsidiary, Monticello Raceway Management, Inc. The 230-acre (93 ha) property is located approximately 90 miles northwest of New York City. The complex offers over 1,110 VGMs, with over 40 electronic table game positions, over 1,000 video lottery terminal slot machines, electronic table games, and one of the largest all-weather harness horse racing tracks in the nation. On January 23, 2019, Empire announced that it would close Monticello Casino‚Äôs VGM operations ‚Äúon or about April 23,‚Äù 2019.

Biography Sirvi√∂ formed Kent in 1990 along with vocalist Joakim Berg, bassist Martin Sk√∂ld, drummer Markus Mustonen and keyboardist Thomas Bergqvist. The band originally called themselves Jones & Giftet before changing their name first to Havs√§nglar and later Kent. By that time Bergqvist had been fired from the band and replaced by Martin Roos. After the release of the bands self-titled debut album Roos quit the band to focus on a career at BMG, the band soon recruited Harri M√§nty as a replacement. The band continued to release several critically and commercially successful albums with that line-up intact until 2006 when rhythm guitarist Harri M√§nty left the band. Instead of recruiting a permanent replacement Sirvi√∂ along with Jocke Berg recorded guitars for their 2007 release Tillbaka till samtiden. For live performances the band has since brought along Max Brandt as a non- official guitarist. Besides his role in Kent Sirvi√∂ has also appeared on Lisa Miskovsky's 2006 album Changes as well as produce a number of records for Swedish and Finnish artists. In 2005 Sirvi√∂ married his girlfriend of six years Jennie Persson, at the Maria Magdalena Church in Stockholm. Musical equipment Sirvi√∂ long used a variety of Gibson Les Paul models with the original humbuckers replaced with P-94 single coil pickups during recording and live performances; however, for the recording of Tillbaka till samtiden Sirvi√∂ primarily used a 1967 Fender Custom Telecaster. Occasionally Sirvi√∂ uses an e-bow on his guitar, often combined with a delay pedal. Sirvi√∂'s main amplifier for the recording was a 1963 Vox AC30 but a 1954 Fender Concert and a 1964 Hiwatt Custom 100 were also used.

Edmondson, 2001 OK 110, 37 P.3d 882 (2001), was an Oklahoma Supreme Court case that ruled that the Governor of Oklahoma could not alter the structure of his Cabinet without the approval of the Legislature. The case was primarily concerned with the Governor-Legislature relation. The case is unique because the two parties in the case were both state-wide elected officials: *Frank Keating, the Governor of Oklahoma, was the plaintiff *Drew Edmondson, the Attorney General of Oklahoma, was the defendant Background In 1986, the Oklahoma Legislature passed the Executive Branch Reform Act of 1986. The Act allows each Governor of Oklahoma, within 45 days of assuming office, to organize the various State agencies, boards, and commissions into between 10 and 15 Cabinet Departments, with each headed by a Cabinet Secretary. The Governor is allowed to create whatever Cabinet Department he desires and may assign such State agencies to that Cabinet Department as he sees fit. The State agencies assigned to a cabinet department must have \\"similar programmatic or administrative objectives\\" but that definition is left to the Governor for determination. Once established, the Governor's Cabinet remains in effect until the Legislature supersedes the governor's organization. In early May 2000, Governor Frank Keating appointed Russell Perry as acting Secretary of Commerce and sent his nomination as full Secretary to the Oklahoma Senate for approval. However, his nomination was deemed rejected when the Oklahoma Legislature adjourned without consideration his nomination. In response, on May 26, 2000, Governor Keating issued Executive Order No. 2000-11, which abolished the Cabinet Department of Commerce and creating the Cabinet Department of Economic Development and Special Affairs. On the same day, the Governor appointed Russell Perry to serve as the newly created position of Secretary of Economic Development and Special Affairs. On June 8, 2000, State Senator Angela Monson submitted a request for an official opinion to Attorney General Drew Edmondson concerning the Governor's authority to make changes in his cabinet. Pursuant to statutorily imposed duties, the Attorney General issued an official opinion (Attorney General Opinion 2000 OK AG 54) on October 26, 2000, providing: Recognizing his duty to follow the Attorney General's opinion until overturned by a court of competent jurisdiction, Governor Keating filed a petition on October 27, 2000, in the District Court of Oklahoma County. The Governor's petition wanted a declaration of relief and stay of effectiveness of the opinion and challenged the cited portions of the opinion. After hearing oral argument and considering the briefs of the parties and of the amicus curiae, such as Stratton Taylor, the President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate, the trial judge found the Attorney General's opinion to be a correct statement of the law set forth in the Executive Branch Reform Act of 1986. On December 5, 2000, judgment was entered in the Attorney General's favor and a stay pending appeal was granted. On December 29, 2000, the Governor appealed a single issue - whether a Governor is empowered to reorganize the executive Cabinet throughout the term of office. The appeal was sent to the Oklahoma Supreme Court for consideration. Case The Governor asserted that the Executive Branch Reform Act should be interpreted to permit gubernatorial reorganization of his Cabinet throughout a term of office as changing times and circumstances warrant. He argued that the forty-five-day time limitation contained in the statute is merely the period within which the initial Cabinet must be formed. The Attorney General contended that the plain language of the law: * requires the creation of an executive Cabinet within forty-five days of the Governor's taking office * the Cabinet so created cannot be altered absent legislative intervention While acknowledging the legislative authority to alter the executive Cabinet, the Governor argued that the Executive Branch Reform Act contains no express limitation on his reorganization authority. He asserted that the statute was ambiguous in that it does not expressly prevent the governor from altering or amending his cabinet after it is initially established. The Governor contended that the cabinet, however designed or altered during the chief executive's term, will be in effect under the statute unless expressly superseded by the Legislature. Decision The Supreme Court decided the case on December 4, 2001. In a unanimous decision, the Court rejected the Governor's appeal. Chief Justice Hargrave authored the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Watt, Hodges, Lavender, Opala, Kauger, Summers, and Boudreau. Justice Winchester wrote a concurring opinion to the majority. Noting that the legislative intent was clear and not ambiguous, the Court rejected the Governor's position and found that state law provided the Governor no power to alter the Cabinet at will. The Court held that by virtue of office as the chief executive of the state, the Governor did not possess any inherent power to reorganize the Cabinet as circumstances require. The Legislature, it continued, was the only branch that held the reorganization power. Had the Legislature intended to allow gubernatorial authority to alter the cabinet, it could have provided it in the law. The Court found that: In its majority opinion, the Court did mention that the Legislature was free to amend the Executive Branch Reform Act of 1986 to include the flexibility Governor Keating desired.

It was built in the 14th century to protect the waterway and collect duties on transported goods, the castle is renowned for its impressive views. It has enchanted a variety of visiting artists, most notably Goethe, Richard Wagner, and Karel Hynek M√°cha.  History  St≈ôekov Castle was built in 1316 for John of Luxembourg, the father of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, to guard an important trade route to Germany. After changing hands several times, the castle was acquired by the Lobkowicz family in 1563. Its strategic importance led to occupations by Imperial Habsburg, Saxon, and Swedish forces during the Thirty Years' War, as well as successive sieges by Austrian and Prussian armies during the Seven Years' War. Although St≈ôekov Castle was heavily damaged during those conflicts and abandoned as a military installation by the end of the 18th century, the 1800s saw many poets and artists visiting the castle, drawn by a new trend of interest in romantic ruins. Goethe declared the view from the castle's position above the Elbe to be the most beautiful in Central Europe, while Richard Wagner's opera Tannh√§user was supposedly inspired by his visit to St≈ôekov. The castle was confiscated by the Nazi regime and later the Communist government, but was restituted to the Lobkowicz family in the early 1990s.  Architecture  St≈ôekov castle St≈ôekov Castle is divided into two sections connected by an arched bridge spanning a natural moat‚Äîan unusual style for the 14th century, when it was first built. The castle‚Äôs semiround bastions, inspired by French architecture, are possibly the first example of that type of defensive design in Bohemia. The connecting round tower, a smaller tower guarding the castle entrance, and an irregular oblong section of the castle date back to the very earliest period of construction.

It was written by Peter Bowker and has been produced by Kudos for BBC Northern Ireland.James Nesbitt, Stephen Graham and Warren Brown lead the cast in BBC One drama Occupation It took four years to bring the serial to screen. Filming took place in Morocco and Northern Ireland. The serial follows the fortunes of three British Army soldiers from the 2003 invasion of Basra to 2007. Each is inspired to return to Basra for different reasons: one returns for love, one for monetary gain, and one for his belief in the mission to rebuild the country. Episodes =Episode 1= A British Army section led by Sergeant Mike Swift are attempting to assault a sniper group in an apartment block in Basra. The group are caught in a grenade blast, and several members of the section and an innocent young Iraqi girl are injured. Swift carries the girl to a local hospital, where he meets Dr Aliya Nabil. The unit returns to Manchester, England, with Swift being hailed as a hero, but all experience difficulty integrating back into normal family life. The girl and Aliya have also travelled to England, and Swift begins to fall in love with the doctor, nearly embarking on an affair. Having left the Army, Corporal Danny Ferguson finds solace in drugs, before going into partnership with Sergeant Erik Lester, a former U.S. Marine who was impressed by Ferguson's calmness under fire and has gone into business as a contractor for a private military company. Ferguson and Lester return to Iraq, and secure a contract to escort American businessmen around hospitals and clinics they are planning to rebuild. Lance Corporal Lee Hibbs, having also left the Army and being unimpressed with work as a nightclub bouncer, joins Ferguson and Lester, thinking he can play a role in rebuilding Iraq. On their first assignment, the escort group dress and apply makeup to look like Arabs, and begin their escort job in two old cars. After becoming separated from their other car, Ferguson and Lester, with the American businessman, are ambushed in a roadblock, and the episode ends with Ferguson somewhat comically stripping naked in front of a British patrol shouting \\"I'm from Kirkby!\\", mirroring the actor's real world origins, in order to prove he is British, the car having been driven away from the ambush by Lester, who has been shot in the neck. Meanwhile, Aliya and the little girl return to Iraq without telling Swift, leading him to volunteer to return. =Episode 2= Episode 2 begins in March 2004, four months after episode 1. Swift, promoted to Staff Sergeant and transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps,He wears an RAMC tactical flash for the rest of the story. is looking for Aliya by enquiring at her former hospital, where he meets Dr Sadiq Alasadi, a male doctor and influential local figure, who had been missing presumed dead in prison under Saddam Hussein's rule. Having saved the American, Lester and Ferguson outfit, Pacific Solutions, has flourished, and they are looking to expand from simple escort protection of contractors, to organising the reconstruction projects as well, starting with Sadiq's hospital. Reunited, Ferguson informs Swift that he knows where Aliya is, and while as a friend warns him against contacting her, as a businessman he says he will tell him, in exchange for putting a word in with Sadiq. He agrees, but on finding her working in another clinic she again refuses his advances and reveals she had been married all along. Swift, Ferguson and Lester meet Sadiq at the hospital, and once he learns of Swift's earlier heroics, Paterson and Lester secure the contract. In the process, Swift learns that Sadiq is Aliya's husband, to the amusement of Lester and Ferguson. On a further visit, Aliya rejects an offer from Swift to take her to England, even though conditions for her are worsening in Iraq. Moving into August 2004, Yunis, an Iraqi translator working for Pacific solutions, who has befriended Hibbs, leaves the firm to set up his own pizzeria. While at his shop, Yunis is murdered by two Iraqi policeman for collaborating. Hibbs is off guard not expecting danger, as he trained the pair while he was in the Army. Hibbs, angry at the death, seeks revenge, but is persuaded not to act by Ferguson and Lester. Fearing he is having a breakdown, Ferguson arranges for Swift to take Hibbs back to England on his transport a week later, as he finishes his second tour. A year later, Hibbs and Swift are back home, and it is around the time of the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Hibbs' view of the Iraqi people has hardened, and he states he endorses the July attackers' actions, if it makes his sister, who has constantly opposed the war, realise \\"what they are like\\". Meanwhile, in Iraq, Pacific Solutions is expanding, and Ferguson and Lester enter a partnership with Western investors in Dubai, explaining how they cream money off the top of coalition reconstruction grants by inventing cost overruns. Swift's wife has guessed that he had an affair and demands he leave the marital home. Hibbs, obsessed with Yunis's death, returns to Iraq at Christmas, visits his wife and family, and gives them all his savings. On leaving their house, he is kidnapped by a militant group led by the two policeman he knows. The episode ends with Hibbs being forced to video a statement stating that he is a private contractor and he and the United States and British forces should not be in Iraq. Meanwhile, against the wishes of Lester, Ferguson and a colleague look for him in the streets of Basra. =Episode 3= Still in December 2005, Ferguson has located the police station where Hibbs is being held after being told by Yassin, Yunis's teenage son, who witnessed the kidnap. He is successfully exchanged for money, to the anger of Lester. To pay back Lester, Ferguson persuades him that Hibbs can be used to drive a regular truck shipment they have been contracted to undertake from Kuwait to Basra, which routinely runs empty while Pacific Solutions are still paid for the job. Ferguson and Lester meet Sadiq to sign off on a contract. After Ferguson attempts a last minute change to the sundries total from $6,000 to $60,000, the doctor refuses to sign the contract, to the annoyance of Lester who sees an avenue to millions of dollars' worth of contacts closed. Back at base, Ferguson forges the doctor's signature on the contract and tells Lester to go ahead with it. Sadiq gets into an argument with three young militiamen who want treatment for a wounded member, but object to the hospital's continued use of women doctors against mosque instructions. As he leaves for home, he is kidnapped by unseen assailants as he stands next to his car. By June 2007, Swift's son, Richard, has decided to join the Army, and instead of leaving the Army, Swift, who is now divorced, returns to Basra to watch over his son on his first tour. Relations between Lester and Ferguson worsen as Ferguson expresses boredom with life in Dubai. They agree to split their skills, with Lester in Dubai and Petersen in Basra. Swift learns of Sadiq's kidnap, and visits his wife in the hospital, where she is now forced to work out of sight in the pharmacy. While he is obliged to communicate through a male intermediary, she tells him she does not know who is holding him and that no ransom demand has been made. After consulting with Yassin, Swift theorises that, since no ransom has been demanded, he may have been arrested by British or American authorities, but gets nowhere with inquiries. Swift arranges for Hibbs to bring Aliya to his office, where they have sex, apparently for the first time, and Yassin, who has been getting progressively more religious, expresses displeasure at being in the company of \\"immoral women\\" like her. Three months later, having got nowhere, Swift turns to Ferguson for help, and they argue, as Ferguson assumes that Sadiq must have done something to deserve being arrested, being no good just like \\"everybody in this country\\", bombing and killing each other over religion and tribal conflict. After Swift leaves, Ferguson eventually instructs Hibbs and a colleague to do a job for him; they protest that they should not go outside with fewer than six men, and he counters that work is drying up and they cannot afford to use more. Hibbs meets an Arab pair in the desert, who in exchange for money, hand over a hooded man, who Hibbs discovers is Sadiq. They return him to the hospital, and pay him off with compensation, insisting the incident was a case of mistaken identity. As they leave, they drive into a demonstrating mob, and after grounding their car are forced to escape on foot as the mob turns on them. As Swift is in the British base, attempting to counsel his son who is not coping well with his first tour, he gets a message from Aliya, asking him to come to the hospital. On arriving, Sadiq reveals it was Ferguson who kidnapped him, and he urges Swift to go to the press to expose Pacific Solutions and to take Aliya out of Iraq, intimating that he knows of their affair, but believes that he \\"is finished\\" and that Swift is her best hope of safety. Lester returns to the Basra Pacific office, and is angry at Ferguson, blaming his erratic behaviour, bullying and forgery for losing a multimillion-dollar oil field deal. As they argue, Ferguson receives a call for help from Hibbs, who with his colleague are pinned down. Lester prepares to leave to help Hibbs, while urging Ferguson to take some responsibility for the situation. Ferguson responds by stating he will call the British Army in to rescue the pair, over objections from Lester, who states it would finish them in Iraq. Richard Swift is a member of the patrol tasked to rescue Hibbs, but is separated from his unit and finds himself in an apartment block. He unsuccessfully attempts to radio for help, and then texts his father, who is in the hospital with Sadiq and Aliya; all three are by now helping the victims of the developing violence outside. As militia arrive, Yassin now among them, Swift is urged to leave by his translator. As Swift leaves, Aliya is pinned up against a wall and shot in the head by Yassin. Swift receives the text message from his son, and finds him dead in the apartment block. Back in England, Ferguson, Hibbs and Swift are at Richard's funeral. The episode ends with the men in a bar afterwards, with Swift angry at Ferguson, blaming him for his son being there, fighting the guilt of having not got to him in time. Hibbs, having become a counsellor for returning servicemen, is prepared to aid Swift in \\"taking down\\" Ferguson and Lester with information about their dodgy dealings. Ferguson retaliates by stating that his new-found reason for risking his life in Iraq is money, in contrast to the lack of a reason while in the Army. Swift questions what has happened to him, to which he replies \\"I went to Iraq, why, what happened to you?\\". The episode ends poignantly as all three are left sitting in the bar, all close to tears.

Writing for The Times, Caitlin Moran praised Nesbitt's performance as \\"surpringsly gripping\\". Helen Rumbelow, also from The Times, reviewed the first episode and felt the opening \\"a sequence of brilliant film-making\\" but criticised the acting from Nesbitt and Graham as \\"a touch too comedic\\". The Telegraph felt the series gave \\"a poignant sense of the ironies\\" of the war in Iraq, praised writer Peter Bowker and summarised by calling the series \\"Truly excellent\\". Kathryn Flett wrote in The Guardian that \\"Nesbitt was very good and easy to like\\" but \\"not the film's star\\", feeling that performances by Stephen Graham and Warren Brown \\"made the deeper, more lasting impression\\". She also praised the writing as \\"thrilling - funny, sad, real, believable\\".

During the 1905 Russian Revolution, Tokar lived in Warsaw (then part of the Russian Empire) where he was a member of an anarchist collective of Jewish workers known as International. His daring in propaganda of the deed won him renown within the Russian anarchist movement. After escaping arrest by the police in Warsaw, he became a fugitive before being captured and imprisoned in the city's notorious Citadel prison. Possessing no identifying documents, he defied torture and managed to withhold his name from the authorities. In 1907 he escaped, fleeing first to Paris and then to London, where he became an associate of the revolutionary, Judith Goodman, and anarchist theorist, Rudolf Rocker. Finding life in both cities too tame, he returned from London to Paris with the intention of returning to Russia. In Paris he met a group of similarly disposed young Russian illegalists, with whom he planned to rob a Parisian bank, but the group were betrayed by one of their own and arrested. Under the influence of Prime Minister Clemenceau, who was sympathetic to their youthful idealism and unaware of their criminal intent, the group were not imprisoned but rather were ordered to leave Paris on the next train. Tokar returned to London, where he remained for nearly a year before informing his colleagues that he was unable to tolerate it any longer and would risk traveling to Russia, whatever the consequences. In January 1909 he finally returned to his native country, settling in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. There he read reports of the cruel torture of political prisoners in Vilnius and resolved to assassinate Sergei Gershelman, the military commander responsible. Tokar went to Vilnius where, on December 6, 1909, he shot at Gershelman as the latter drove his carriage through the street. Though Gershelman was uninjured, Tokar's shots wounded General Fenga, who had accompanied Gershelman in the carriage. Tokar was sentenced to death for the crime on January 13, 1910. In his cell a couple of days before he was to be executed, Moishe Tokar doused himself in paraffin from his lamp and burned himself alive.

These conditions were researched years earlier by J. Johansson and coworkers studying the production of spider silk proteins. The proteins used in this study are a miniaturized version of the silk monomers found in nature but behave the same way, and because of these modifications, they were able to express functionalized regions of the protein 4RepCT, which is a self-assembling recombinant dragline silk protein, derived from the nursery-web spider along the axis of the filament. = Methods = Methods of functionalizing the 4RepCT protein have been successful, but not in the way of reliably producing a stable protein functionalization in biologic environments that can also be tuned and modified. Genetic fusion of functional peptide sequences to silk genes and chemical conjugation of functional molecules onto amino acid side chains are the only two methods currently known to achieve a functionalized 4RepCT protein with tunable functionality. The first approach has the advantage that post-translational manipulation of the silk is minimized. Unfortunately, genetic manipulation is challenging due to the high GC (guanine-cytosine) content of the gene which leads to transcription errors. This method also limits the prevalence of functional binding sites to a single ligand-binding site per 25 kDa 4RepCT silk protein. Large adaptor proteins such as antibodies can be used to display more binding sites, but it isn't considered a feasible solution. This method has been shown to produce 4RepCT proteins that have a higher cell adhesion than natural spidroin proteins and have varied antimicrobial properties. The second method, chemical modification of the silk proteins should result in the covalent attachment of several copies of a wide range of organic and organometallic ligands using robust or sensitive linkers depending on the application. The challenge with this method is it is difficult to make the modification of the 4RepCT protein site-specific. Specific site targeting requires the residues to also be modified to be accessible and chemically bioorthogonal to the rest of the silk protein. Cytosine residues are commonly used for this type of conjugation through a Michael addition, but they tend to undergo exchange reactions which makes them unstable for long durations in a biological environment. These two methods are rather outdated but have been useful in validating the fact that 4RepCT can be tuned in the important areas of cellular adhesion, antimicrobial potency, and the type of molecule or drug attached to it. More recently azide functional groups have been conjugated to the N-terminal of a dragline silk protein using EDC/NHS coupling, yielding glycopolymer-conjugated films with enhanced cell adhesion and DNA-silk chimeras with controllable micro-architectures. Armed with this, the researchers in this study investigated the incorporation of 3 L-Aha residues into 4RepCT, yielding 4RepCT^{3Aha} . The azide side chains of L-Aha allow highly specific and efficient site-specific conjugation to a lot different of functional molecules via Staudinger ligation with phosphine reagents, and Copper (I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) or Strain promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) in click reactions. = Preferred click reactions = CuAAC and SPAAC are both common click reactions which are often interchangeable in click chemistry. It is well known that intracellular Cu(I) is cytotoxic, which means CuAAC is not as common as SPAAC click reactions for research leading to in-vivo applications. The researchers for this study decided to use CuAAC, despite the purpose of this research to have in-vivo applications, for a few reasons. First, the likelihood for copper to be bound by the 4RepCT^{3Aha} protein is low due to the presence of only 2 glutamic acid residues and no histidine residues (two residues with a high affinity for Cu(I)). These residues are present in the thioredoxin; which is the solubilizing fusion partner conjugated to the 4RepCT protein during synthesis. However, this does not cause issues since the thioredoxin is removed in order to trigger the self-assembly reaction with thrombin which results in fiber formation. This removal of the Cu(I) laden thioredoxin removes virtually all copper from the silk structure. The researchers also, through a buffer containing EDTA and by utilizing THPTA (which stabilizes the copper ions), rinsed the fibers resulting in further removal of Cu(I) leaving a <0.1 % by weight trace of copper ions. Secondly, CuAAC outperforms SPAAC in click reactions where proteins with a high cytosine content, such as 4RepCT, are present. The SPAAC process, in the presence of proteins like 4RepCT, will often create ‚Äòclicks‚Äô in off-target sites resulting in the ligand conjugating to the wrong part of the protein and rendering the protein essentially useless. In order to maximize the number of functional sites along the fiber, CuAAC is preferred. = Leading results = This study demonstrated the CuAAC mediated conjugation of 4RepCT^{3Aha} with two different fluorophores and the antibiotic levofloxacin, showcasing the potential of covalently functionalized recombinant spider silk proteins as biomaterials with enhanced properties. The researchers were able to successfully conjugate 4RepCT^{3Aha} with alkyne fluorophores, proving the protein can be functionalized through an azide group while conjugated to the axis of the silk fiber. Their results showed not only an intense uniform fluorescence along the fiber axis but also an intense uniform composite fluorescence when the fiber was decorated with two different fluorophores in a 1:1 ratio. To prove the functional azide group could be decorated with a clinically relevant molecule, the researchers attempted to decorate the fiber with glycidyl propargyl ether (and acid-labile linker) and bound Levofloxacin (a gram-positive targeting antibiotic) to it using an ester bond between the epoxide carboxylate groups respectively. They conducted an inhibition zone assay with the functionalized silk fibers against E. Coli NCTC 12242 bacteria where each factor level contained LB media. Their results showed a successful functionalization of the Levofloxacin decorated fiber which maintained an antibiotic persistence across a 3.5 cm radius for 120 hours and a cell density ~50% of other factor levels (LB media only, unfunctionalized silk, and Levofloxacin doped silk) with p ‚â§ 0.01. A maximum sustained release of Levofloxacin from the fiber of 5 days was achieved.  Dermal applications  = Historical = Spider silk is one of the earliest known dermal patches. Primarily used for wound binding, the glycoprotein adhesive found on the capture spiral silk, as well as the protein structure of the fiber itself, has mild antibacterial properties. Due to the silk acting as a local antiseptic, which of course wasn't discovered until modern medicine, reduced the rate of wound borne sepsis and chronic illness. The silk's viscoelastic properties and inordinate tensile strength and toughness aided wound healing by acting in what we know today as 'surgical tape'. = Proposed = Despite its superiority to current methods of large surface area wound care‚Äîgauze wrapping, honey vinegar treatments, and systemic antibiotics‚Äîas well as other popular dermal patch uses, spider silk has not found its way into clinical practice. Historically the main reason for this is it's very difficult to farm and harvest. Unlike silkworms who spin silk for several easy-to-replicate conditions, spiders spin silk for specific purposes such as catching prey, which would be difficult to replicate in a lab space. In addition, spiders generally tend to be cannibalistic, so population control would prove to be another nearly impossible hurdle in a farming process. Forced silking yields silks that are outside a desirable regime. The most popular proposed use case for dermal applications are: * Dermal patch for local drug delivery * Local antibiotic wound dressings * Local dermal reperfusion scaffolds * Cutaneous mucosal adhesive for attaching non-adhesive local drug delivery devices  Silkworm silk  = Current research = Research shows silkworm silk does not possess any inherent antibiotic characteristics, bio-mimicking mechanical properties, and can cause fatal respiratory allergic reactions in some people. Recent studies show that recombinantly produced spider silk proteins self-assemble at the liquid-air interface of a standing solution, forming protein permeable, super strong and ultra flexible membranes. The unforced self-assembly creates a nanofibrilar membrane which supports cell growth. A confluent layer of human skin cells form within three days and would be suitable for direct delivery to a patient. = Dermal applications = Due to silkworm silk being potentially fatal to humans when in contact with vasculature, there is no approved dermal patch, or dermal patch-like, application for silkworm silk.

While male onry≈ç can be found, mainly in kabuki theatre, the majority are women, powerless in the physical world, they often suffer at the capricious whims of their male lovers. In death they become strong. Gory≈ç are vengeance ghosts from the aristocratic classes, especially those who have been martyred. Literature and arts Fear of ghosts, their vengeance and mischief is a common base for a plot in the ghost story literary genre and in ghost movies. In cartoons and comics, Casper's efforts to make friends is hampered by humans, animals and even inanimate objects irrationally panicking, screaming and running away at the sight of him. It may be said that the characters Shaggy and Scooby from the TV and movie franchise Scooby-Doo suffer from phasmophobia, with the added joke that the ghosts they encountered were usually criminals masquerading as ghosts, specifically preying on people's phasmophobia as a cover for their criminal activities.

Its goal was to cut the poverty rate in India in half by the year 2015. Through a network of 665 civil society organizations, it covered almost 20,000 villages in 94 districts in 6 Indian states. PACS received over $25 million funding from the UK‚Äôs Department for Internal Development (DFID). In addition to raising public awareness about the plight of poor Indians, PACS distributed food and ration cards to impoverished families, helped to set up a variety of social welfare programs (such as pension programs for retirees and widows, programs to help the disabled, scholarship programs, etc.) and gave additional funding to existing infrastructure programs so that water, electrical and sanitation systems could be improved in urban areas and could be constructed in rural areas that had been without these services before. PACS was also involved in fostering women‚Äôs rights in India‚Äìparticularly in sending more little girls to school, encouraging more women to vote and educating the population about family planning options. Additionally, a drought and disaster relief fund was created to assist rural farmers. Finally, PACS encouraged more poor people to participate in the political process (through voting, through community action programs, etc.) in the hopes of giving them the tools that they will need to help themselves in the future Poorest Areas Civil Society Program.

History =Early bands and formation (2000-2006)= After the Anthems officially formed in October 2006. However, Philip Ciufo, Lee Zavitz, and Phil Johnston have played together in former bands since October 2000. Zavitz met Ciufo in 1999 in their grade 9 year through a common interest of skateboarding and music. They would spend a lot of time at the local skate park and also making music. Johnston knew Zavitz through common friend Dan Curry. When Johnston entered high school in 2000, he was introduced to the two, and was soon recruited as their drummer. A band was formed under the title 6 Days Late which was changed shortly after to Unidentified 6. The band performed their first show during their junior years at their high school. They played local shows and created four albums of songs collectively titled: Do Humans Look Like Their Pets?, Lights Go Out, Unaware, and Loser, as well as several untitled EPs which they distributed at their high school. The band's title remained Unidentified 6 for four years until 2004 when they changed their name to One Way Out. Up until that time, Zavitz played the bass. After the name change, Tim Stead joined the trio to play bass while Zavitz switched to guitar. One Way Out released a self-titled album in 2004 and an EP titled Salvage What's Left in 2005.One Way Out at MySpace Shortly after the release of their EP the band went on a short tour with John Reuben and also opened for Thousand Foot Krutch, Seventh Day Slumber, and Hawk Nelson. Shortly after, Stead left the band due to complications with the other members. He was replaced by long-time friend Dan Curry who played with the band until March 2006. At this time the four went on hiatus. =This is the Sound (2007)= In October 2006, Ciufo re-joined with Zavitz and Johnston to officially form After the Anthems. Over the course of 2006 and 2007, the three went on to record This is the Sound which was released in September 2007. In August, Jason Soloduik was added to the lineup to play bass. The band then went on tour throughout North America from October to December at which point Soloduik was removed from the band due to complications with the other members. On February 24, 2007 the band released a 6-song EP titled \\"It's DejaVu All over Again\\".Deja Vu Released on Itunes The album contains the cover version of \\"The Power of Love\\" as well as 5 new original songs. The Power of Love eventually went to No. 1 on the CT20 in May 2009. According to their website, After The Anthems is currently back in the studio recording new songs. On April 29, 2010 they released a mashup cover of 3 songs. The song is titled \\"One time I replayed the empire state of mind\\" and is a cover of \\"One Time\\" by Justin Bieber, \\"Empire State of Mind\\" by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, and \\"Replay\\" by Iyaz. The song was released on a new Facebook application called MuSwap.

Mainly used for commercial applications early on, they did not gain popularity for passenger travel until their development in Europe in the 1950s.If diesel engines are more efficient, why do most cars come with gasoline engines? Early 20th century Charles Wallace Chapman at Perkins Engines at Peterborough, England, developed an engine, the high speed diesel engine, for automobiles; previously diesel engines were too large and heavy. Production diesel car history started in 1933 with Citro√´n's Rosalie, which featured a diesel engine option (the 1,766 cc 11UD engine) in the Familiale (estate or station wagon) model. The Mercedes-Benz 260D and the Hanomag Rekord were introduced in 1936. Immediately after World War II, and throughout the 1950s and 1960s, diesel-powered cars began to gain limited popularity, particularly for commercial applications, such as ambulances, taxis, and station wagons used for delivery work. Most were conventional in design. Mercedes-Benz offered a continuous stream of diesel-powered taxis, beginning in 1949 with their 170D powered by the OM-636 engine. Later, in 1959 their OM-621 engine was introduced in the 180D. This 2.0 L engine produced at 4,350 rpm. Beginning in 1959, Peugeot offered the 403D with their TMD-85 four- cylinder engine of 1.8 L and , followed in 1962 by the 404D with the same engine. In 1964, the 404D became available with the improved XD88 four- cylinder engine of 2.0 L and . Other cars available with diesel power during this era included the Austin A60 Cambridge, Isuzu Bellel, Fiat 1400-A, Standard Vanguard, Borgward Hansa, and a few others. In 1967, Peugeot introduced the world's first compact, high-speed diesel car, the Peugeot 204BD. Its 1.3 L XL4D engine produces at 5,000 rpm. Following the 1970s oil crisis (1973 and 1979), Volkswagen introduced their first diesel, the VW Golf, with a 1.5 L naturally aspirated indirect-injection engine which was a redesigned (dieselised) version of a gasoline engine. Mercedes-Benz tested turbodiesels in cars (e.g. by the Mercedes-Benz C111 experimental and record- setting vehicles) and the first production turbo diesel cars were, in 1978, the 3.0 5-cylinder 115 hp (86 kW) Mercedes 300 SD, available only in North America, and the Peugeot 604. The biggest single step forward for mass-market diesel cars came in 1982 when PSA Peugeot Citro√´n introduced the XUD engine in the Peugeot 305, Peugeot 205 and Talbot Horizon. This was the class leading automotive diesel engine until the mid-1990s.\\"Diesel Car\\" (Future Publishing Limited, July edition, 1993), p.104 The first mass market turbo diesel was the XUD powered, 1988 Citro√´n BX and then the 1989 Peugeot 405, they gave power and refinement approaching petrol engine standards,\\"Diesel Car\\" (Future Publishing Limited, August/September edition, 1998), p.19 with the best chassis in their class. Diesel Car magazine said of the Citro√´n BX \\"We can think of no other car currently on sale in the UK that comes anywhere near approaching the BX Turbo's combination of performance, accommodation and economy\\".\\"Diesel Car\\" (Future Publishing Limited, August/September edition, 1998), p.22 These were the cars that started the diesel boom in Europe that has now hit 50% of the market in new car sales. Diesels carried a 2.5% share of the European Community market in 1973. Following the fuel crisis, this share increased to 4.1% in 1975. This more than doubled (to 8.6%) by 1980, and by 1983 diesels represented 11% of new car sales in the EU. Diesel Powered Passenger Cars in North America have been steadily increasing in popularity, especially in the early-mid 2000s. Diesels have typically only been used in trucks and commercial vehicles and buses. Jeep had offered a Perkins Diesel option for its models in the early 1960s and Chrysler offered them as well although mainly for the European market though some have probably been retrofitted to older AMC and Chrysler models in the US, particularly as taxis. Oldsmobile released a 350 cubic Inch (5.7 Litre) V8 diesel Engine starting in the late 1970s, most Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Chevrolet and even Cadillac divisions of General Motors, had received this engine by the 1980 model year, and continued to be sold until the engine was discontinued in 1985. Whilst a very good idea at the time, owing to the recent 1979 energy crisis these engines had gained a terrible reputation for reliability. Part of this had to do with the fact that, whilst the engine block itself was indeed a diesel specific design (contrary to most people's belief that it was simply a dieselised version of the famous rocket V8), GM management made significant cost saving measures by using many parts from the gas V8 counterpart which were not up to the task of diesel engine operation, specifically the number and type of head bolts used, and the lack of a water and fuel separator in the fuel line, a big issue as a lot of diesel fuel contained water and also high levels of sulfur at the time. The engine was later revised into the DX block and most of the issues were fixed, a V6 version displacing 4.3 litres and a smaller 4.3 V8 were also offered around this time, mainly for the downsized front-wheel drive models of the mid-1980s and although they were much better in the reliability department, the damage had already been done and the North American diesel car market was severely crippled as a result, despite the best efforts by Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Peugeot, VW and others in offering their more refined and powerful diesel engines. All of these olds designed units were non-turbocharged (or natural-aspirated) diesels. This undoubtedly hampered them in the performance and efficiency departments, although there have been retrofits of turbochargers to Olds diesel blocks which are carried out by enthusiasts and collectors of these cars. It isn't well proven if turbos are reliable long-term with these engines, but so far they seem to be suitable, however, what performance benefit they bring could be considered as dubious given how low their power output was to begin with. 1990s and the present Diesels steadily gained in acceptance with private buyers in the 1970s and into the 1990s. Having originally been mainly marketed to commercial users such as taxi drivers, European diesel sales increased steadily and reached 17.3 per cent of the overall European market by 1992. Many Audi enthusiasts claim that the Audi 100 TDI was the first turbo charged direct injection diesel sold in 1989, but actually it isn't true, as the Fiat Croma TD-i.d. was sold with turbo direct injection in 1987 and one year later Austin Rover Montego. What was pioneering about the Audi 100, however, was the use of electronic control of the engine, as the Fiat and Austin had Bosch mechanically controlled injection. In the writers experience the Audi 100 TDI was very troublesome and the engine code \\"AAT\\" is often known as the difficult Audi . The electronic control of direct injection really made a difference in terms of emissions, refinement and power. All earlier generation car direct injection diesel engines benefit greatly from the use of biodiesel fuel, which reduces emissions and greatly improves refinement without engine modifications, provided they use compatible 'Viton' type rubber in their fuel systems. The diesel car markets are the same ones who pioneered various developments (Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Peugeot/Citro√´n, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Volkswagen Group) There were also small diesel engines produced in England by British Leyland and Perkins. For reasons of economy the petrol BMC \\"B\\" series engine was dieselised and produced in capacities of 1.5 and 1.8 litres. Perkins produced the 4.99, 4.107 and 4.108 engines all of which were extremely reliable. Later BL produced the five main bearing \\"O\\" series engine which was extremely strong. Petrol turbo variants could make 200HP and the engine was ideal for converting to a diesel. In fact, the 1988 Austin-Rover MDi unit (also known as the 'Perkins Prima') was developed by Perkins Engines of Peterborough, who have designed and built high-speed diesels since the 1930s. It is still in production as a marine engine however in the writers opinion timing belts at sea are not a good idea. Engines that rely on timing belts are more suited to inland waterways. It is not easy to make a lightweight and powerful top class diesel engine owing to the immense pressures and heat produced within the engine. These problems were solved by VM Motori of Cento and the engines were apparently so good that Rover, Ford and Jeep bought them. The interesting features of the engines were the tunnel-bore block and separate cylinder heads to allow for expansion. VM engines were marinised by BMW and sold as BMW stern-drive packages. Mercury Marine also used the VM engines. As they have aged in car applications, they have developed a reputation for blowing head gaskets, due to the separate cylinder head design. In 1997, the first common rail diesel passenger car was introduced, the Alfa Romeo 156. In 1998, for the very first time in the history of racing, in the legendary 24 Hours N√ºrburgring race, a diesel-powered car was the overall winner: the BMW works team 320d, a BMW E36 fitted with modern high-pressure diesel injection technology from Robert Bosch GmbH. The low fuel consumption and long range, allowing 4 hours of racing at once, made it a winner, as comparable petrol-powered cars spent more time refueling. Chrysler put a VM Motori SpA engine in the Jeep Liberty sport utility vehicle in 2005 and 2006 to assess the American market's interest in modern high performance diesel engines. In 2004 Honda released their first diesel engine, the N22A branded as the i-CTDI, it first featured in the Honda Accord. The engine featured an aluminium block, DOHC chain driven valvetrain, common rail direct injection and variable geometry turbocharger. In Spring 2005, Mercedes-Benz unveiled their first application of a mass-produced aluminum block diesel engine for passenger vehicles and commercial use. While aluminum is traditionally considered of inferior strength and temperature resistance to withstand diesel applications, Mercedes engineers made extensive use of CAD/CAM design to arrive at an aluminum block that would meet with Mercedes' testing and reliability standards. First use was in 2006 model-year vehicles in the E-Class sedan and ML-class and GL-class SUVs. Similar in weight () to the five-cylinder it replaced, and considerably lighter than the in-line six- cylinder it also replaced, this 3.0L V-6 produces 165 kW (224 hp) at 3,800 rpm and max torque of 510 Nm (376 ft¬∑lbf) at 1,600-2,800 rpm and makes use of a four-valve head. Additionally, fitment of Mercedes-Benz BlueTec system, a concert of emissions control strategies, renders this new diesel 50-state legal in the U.S. beginning in 2008 (stringent NOx limits have made U.S. passenger-car diesels unpopular or impossible in parts of the U.S. in recent years). In 2006, the new Audi R10 TDI LMP1 entered by Joest Racing became the first diesel-engined car to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The winning car also bettered the post-1990 course configuration lap record by 1, at 380 laps. However, this fell short of the all-time distance record set in 1971 by over . The Subaru car company of Japan is preparing to sell its station wagon version of their Legacy mid-size car (called the Subaru Outback in North America) with a 2.0-litre, boxer engine format opposed-four-cylinder diesel engine of power, and of torque, in the United Kingdom. Sales in continental Europe started in 2008. Since the numerous Diesel emissions scandals of recent years the most high profile of which was the Volkswagen emissions scandal of 2015 it has been revealed that the levels of toxic emissions coming from diesel cars are higher and pose a greater risk to human health than those of vehicles powered by other means.  Diesel engine vehicle racing  Although the weight and lower output of a diesel engine tend to keep them away from automotive racing applications, there are many diesels being raced in classes that call for them, mainly in truck racing and tractor pulling, as well in types of racing where these drawbacks are less severe, such as land speed record racing or endurance racing. Even diesel-engined dragsters exist, despite the diesel's drawbacks of weight and low peak rpm, specifications central to performance in this sport. However, in 2006, the new Audi R10 TDI LMP1 entered by Joest Racing became the first diesel-engined car to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans. = Historic = As early as 1931, Clessie Cummins installed his diesel in the Cummins \\"Diesel Special\\" race car, hitting at Daytona and at the Indianapolis 500 race, where Dave Evans became the first driver to complete the Indianapolis 500 without making a single pit stop, completing the full distance on the lead lap and finishing 13th, relying on torque and fuel efficiency to overcome weight and low peak power. In 1933, a 1925 Bentley with a Gardner 4LW engine was the first diesel-engine car to take part in the Monte Carlo Rally when it was driven by Lord Howard de Clifford. It was the leading British car and finished fifth overall. A 1950 \\"Cummins Diesel Special\\" Indianapolis 500 roadster In 1952, Fred Agabashian in a Cummins diesel won the pole at the Indianapolis 500 race with a turbocharged 6.6-liter diesel car, setting a record for pole position lap speed, . Don Cummins and his chief engineer Neve Reiners recognized that the low center of gravity of the flat engine configuration (designed to lie beneath the floor of a bus) plus the power advantage gained by the novel use of Elliott turbocharging would be a winning combination. At the start, a slow pace lap (reportedly less than ) apparently induced what is now referred to as \\"turbo lag\\" and badly hampered the throttle response of the Cummins Diesel. Although Agabashian found himself in eighth place before reaching the first turn, he moved up to fifth in a few laps and was running competitively (albeit well back in the field after a tire change) until the badly situated air intake of the car swallowed enough debris from the track to disable the turbocharger at lap 71; he finished 27th. (incorrect reference to the Cummins Diesel leading laps in the race) In the 1990s and rule makers supported the concept, BMW and Volkswagen raced diesel touring cars, with BMW winning the 1998 24 Hours N√ºrburgring with a 320d against other factory-entered diesel competition of VW and about 200 normally powered cars, mainly by being able to drive very long stints. Alfa Romeo even organized a racing series with their Alfa Romeo 147 1.9 JTD models. In 2006, a BMW 120d repeated a similar result, scoring 5th in a field of 220 cars, many of them much more powerful, a significantly stronger competition than in 1998. The VW Dakar Rally race Touareg for 2005 and 2006 are powered by their own line of TDI engines in order to challenge for the first overall diesel win there. The diesel engine of Audi's 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans-winning R10 TDI Meanwhile, the five time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Audi R8 race car was replaced by the Audi R10 TDI in 2006, which is powered by a and V12 TDI common rail diesel engine, mated to a 5-speed gearbox, instead of the 6 used in the R8, to handle the extra torque produced. The gearbox is considered the main problem, as earlier attempts by others failed due to the lack of suitable transmissions that could stand the torque long enough. After winning the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2006 with their diesel-powered R10 TDI, Audi obtained the overall win at the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans, too. This is the first time a sports car could compete for overall victories with diesel fuel against cars powered with regular fuel or methanol and bio-ethanol. However, the significance of this is slightly lessened by the fact that the ACO/ALMS race rules encourage the use of alternative fuels such as diesel. Audi again triumphed at Sebring in 2007. It had both a speed and fuel economy advantage over the entire field including the Porsche RS Spyders, gasoline powered purpose-built race cars. Audi's diesels won again the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, against competition coming from the Peugeot 908 HDi FAP diesel powered racer. In 2006, the JCB Dieselmax broke the diesel land speed record posting an average speed of over . The vehicle used \\"two diesel engines that have a combined total of 1,500 horsepower (1120 kilowatts). Each is a 4-cylinder, 4.4-liter engine used commercially in a backhoe loader.\\" In the 2008 BTCC, Jason Plato and Darren Turner are racing factory sponsored SEAT Leon TDI with some success against a variety of gasoline powered competitors.

It is played today in villages. History Seven Stones, one of the most ancient games of the Indian subcontinent whose history dates back to the Bhagwata Purana, a Hindu religious text that is claimed to be written 5000 years ago, which mentions Lord Krishna playing the game with his friends. This traditional sport has been played for the last 5 millennia. It is believed to have been originated in the southern parts of the Indian subcontinent. It was one of the most popular outdoor sports in India and Pakistan in the 1990s but it is now almost extinct with very few people playing the game. It often boasts of being the more aggressive version of dodgeball. Gameplay A member of one team (the seekers) throws a ball at a pile of stones to knock them over. The seekers then try to restore the pile of stones while staying safe from the opposing team's (the hitters‚Äô) throws. The hitters' objective is to hit the seekers with the ball before they can reconstruct the stone pile. If the ball touches a seeker, that seeker is out and the team the seeker came from continues, without the seeker. A seeker can always safeguard themselves by touching an opposite team member before the ball hits the seeker. =Additional rules= * The throwing seeker cannot come too close to the piled-up stones while attempting to knock them over. They have to do so from behind a line marked on the ground. * If the person trying to knock down the pile cannot do it in three tries, they are considered out. * In any of the three tries, if the thrower's ball does not knock down the pile and is caught by an opponent after the first bounce then the thrower is out. * Each team contains equal number of players. * Piles of flat stones contain 7 or 5 stones. * Hitters cannot run with the ball to hit the seekers. * The seeker, after restoring the pile of stones, says the game's name to announce the reconstruction of the pile of stones. *  Alternative names Olapanthu - ball made of coconut leaves - used to play the game in Kerala In other parts of India, the same game is known several other names: * pithu garam (Punjab) * Lagori (Karnataka) * Lingoj (Telangana) * Lingorcha, Lagori, Seven Tilo (Maharashtra) * Pitto, Pittu (Haryana, Uttarakhand,Uttar Pradesh, northern Rajasthan and West Bengal) * Sitoliya (Rajasthan, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh) * Satodiyu (Gujarat) * Bam Pitto, pittu (Bihar) * Yedu penkulata, Yedu rallu, dikori or pittu (Andhra Pradesh) * Palli Patti (Karimnagar) * Dabba kali (Kerala, played using a ball made of coconut leaves\\"olapanthu\\")Cohen, Noam. \\"When Knowledge Isn‚Äôt Written, Does It Still Count?\\" The New York Times. 7 August 2011.

While football and cricket were the most commonly played games, ancient and traditional Indian were also played like Kabaddi, Kho-Kho, and Gilli Danda. As time passed by, most of these traditional games began to fade away and very few remained. Kabaddi, for example, became a global phenomenon after being pushed with the Pro Kabaddi League. A game that no kid talked about 7 years ago, is now being enthusiastically watched and played by almost every child of this generation. Fortunately, Kabaddi is not the only traditional sport who gained international popularity. Lagori, which was played a lot by the youth back in the day, has also begun to make its way to the international circuit. Today, Lagori is played by at least 30 nations across the world. The game has gradually gained a considerable amount of global prominence. However, India is the epicentre of the development of the game on with a bigger platform and a wide outreach to contemporary audience. The Indian Lagori Premier League that was held in November 2017 had gathered great momentum across the nation which was organised by the Amateur Lagori Federation of India. They have also made efforts to push the game to several states of India as well as in other countries, playing a pivotal role in popularising the game. The second Lagori World Cup (first being played in 2015) is soon going to take place later this year, several nations including Indian, Bhutan Hong Kong, Brazil, Turket, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal will go face to face. The rules have not changed that much over the years, however there have been some changes brought in the way the game is being played. The following fundamentals were laid down by the International Lagori Foundation: Each team would have 12 players, with only 6 players on the court for every set. One set lasts for 3 minutes followed by a half minute break in between sets. One match has typically 3 sets and the team scoring maximum points wins. Other than that, the rules are basically the same for all leagues. Having said that, the game has definitely come a long way from what it was. From a dusty open field to an indoor synthetic turf, from a pile of stones lying around in the field to 7 circular fibre discs made for the game, and from an old tennis ball to a softball specifically tailored for the game. Despite the game almost being forgotten and becoming extinct in the past few decades, the inaugural World Cup help in 2015 was a huge success paired with the Indian Lagori Premiere League (ILPL) catering to a wide audience in the country, it seems as though Lagori is going through its revival phase. In popular media * In the grand season finale of TVF Triplings, a popular Indian mini internet series made by TVF (The Viral Fever), a game of SPL (Sitoliya Pitto Lagori) acts as the glue that brings together a group of estranged siblings.
